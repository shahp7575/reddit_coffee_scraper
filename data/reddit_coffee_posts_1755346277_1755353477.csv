It might just be a casual nod from a stranger or that brief shared laugh with the barista when your name is hilariously misspelled on the coffee cup (yep, it happens a lot to me!). Even those fleeting connections can wevae this subtle thread of human fabric around you, reminding you that you’re part of something bigger, even if just for a mmoent. 

It’s surprising how these smal encounters can create tiny cracks in the armor of loneliness, letting a little light through.

1mrw7wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1mrw7wu/chapter_49_new_boy_life_and_death_at_the_world/,Chapter 49 New Boy: Life and Death at the World Headquarters of The Jehovah Witnesses,"Chapter 49 God Kills Another Baby

Since I had been in a religion that focused on death and the end of the world as we knew it, it was now time to focus on life.

The wonderful line from *Shawshank Redemption* says it so well: “*Get busy living or get busy dying!”*

I had spent my entire life in a religion that focused on a war that was coming any day –the ultimate war between god and man. The almost total destruction of everything we know.

It was a time to rethink everything.

It was just like my analogy. I had gotten out of the van in New York City and was walking around in a daze. I found a new freedom though. I walked down the street and looked at all of the people walking past me. Something had changed. I looked more closely now. Many of the people had smiling faces. Had they changed? No, I had changed. I now saw the world completely differently. It wasn’t a world *controlled by Satan* and his demons. It was just a stage with many different players on it. A world full of endless possibilities.

Even though I did contemplate it many times, I wasn’t going the same way as Jim Olson, Robert Stillman, Robert Bryant and thousands of others who left The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society by way of suicide. These people who found there was no existence outside the made up world of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

The people that had found death to be their only real option from the hell that their lives had become.

Though I’m sure the Society would have loved it if I had taken myself out, especially after my interview in *The Oregonian,* that wasn’t going to happen.

I love the last line in the movie *Papillon:* *“I’m still here you bastards!”*

One of the many reasons I’m still here is the fact that I had found some new friends, years before I had lost all my Jehovah’s Witness friends. My new friends are Gary Zukav, Neale Walsch, Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, Caroline Myss and Eckhart Tolle. These authors and speakers were able to help me leave the mind-controlled environment I had been dealing with for over fifty years.

These new friends helped me make a transition into the real world. The world where there doesn’t have to be “*us” or “them.”* It seems the planet has been suffering from this illusion for a long time.

These new friends have showed me the meaning of something called *“unconditional love.”* This is what I would call the purist of all loves. This is a love a mother gives her child. Does a baby get this kind of love from its mother because of its performance? Of course not. The mother gives that child unconditional love no matter what. Are we not all god’s children?

Most the religions on the planet believe in *conditional* love. Their love is based on your performance and what you can do for them and their god.

Unconditional love is just that, unconditional.

I’m not here trying to sell a new thought system. I don’t need people to think the same way as me anymore. I went from door to door for decades, trying to peddle my thought system to others. That is not going to happen again.

We should be here to help and support each other and that is why for many years, I hosted *the ex-Jehovah’s Witness meetup* group in Portland, Oregon.

I heard a lot of sad stories about what people had lost trying to get away from the Jehovah’s Witnesses. There were entire families that were wiped out, not usually by shotguns, but by the devastation of shunning and the lack of any real love.

One night, a gentleman showed up to one of the meet ups I was hosting. He had a very interesting story to relate.

Bob had been happily married for many years. He and his wife and children weren’t Jehovah’s Witnesses. In fact, he, like his wife and children, knew nothing about them. That, of course, didn’t matter. The Jehovah’s Witnesses would soon make his life a living Hell. Why? Because his wife ended up having an affair at work with a married Jehovah’s Witness Elder.

She ended up divorcing Bob and started studying with the Jehovah’s Witnesses. The Elder divorced his wife and married Bob’s ex-wife. Because the adulterous Elder was well-liked in his Kingdom Hall, he was reinstated in just a few months.

Bob’s ex-wife and her new husband now have custody of Bob’s two daughters, who were twelve and fourteen years old at the time she left Bob. His children, of course, were now forced to start studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses. This of course led to their indoctrination an baptism.

Now they are one big happy Jehovah’s Witness family.

Bob now has a real problem and is now at *the meetup* group looking for advice. He tells all of us that now when his Jehovah’s Witness children visit him, they tell him how he too will be killed by Jehovah their god in the coming war of Armageddon unless he joins their program.

So, now Bob is asking all of us what he should say to his two daughters when they visit him with their message of his doom.

Oh, by the way, for some odd reason Bob doesn’t want to be a Jehovah’s Witness. I guess because he feels, in essence, the actions of Jehovah’s Witnesses not only tore his family apart but now the Society is brainwashing his children to be mindless drones also. Go figure.

There was another interesting story from someone else who wasn’t a Jehovah’s Witness but still had their life COMPLETELY destroyed by them.

During the time I was hosting *the ex-Jehovah’s Witness meetup group*, I got a very sad and interesting phone call from a woman one afternoon.

Beth called me to ask if there was anything she could do to stop her husband from being re-baptized in the Jehovah’s Witness church this coming Saturday. It was just a few days away.

I said, “Probably not. Why?”

She told me how years ago, she had fallen in love with a man who was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness. He had been out of the organization for many years. They had many happy years together and were now married and expecting their first child. She had a daughter from a previous marriage. She told me how everything was wonderful, until his parents started pressuring him to rejoin the Jehovah’s Witness cult. Her husband started going back to their meetings.

She also told me how his parents had hated her from the beginning of their marriage because she was a *worldly person.* Many months earlier his parents even went so far as to encourage him to leave her – even though she was pregnant – so he could eventually find a good Jehovah’s Witness girl.

Beth told me his parents told her husband that there would be no repercussions for this action because he was already *disfellowshipped* and you can’t be *disfellowshipped* again when you are already *disfellowshipped.*

Here we go again, another one of their strange *Catch 22s.*

Since her husband still loved Beth, he declined his parent’s invitation to ditch his *worldly wife* and soon to be child and decided to stay with her.

Beth was desperate and wanted to know what she could do to stop him from re-joining this group of nasty people, who were trying to break up their marriage.

I told her it was probably too late, since he was being baptized in just a few days. This was something that had to be in the making for many months, if not years. I felt I had to tell her what she could expect now that he was going back into their organization.

It wasn’t going to be easy for her because she had no desire (for some odd reason) to become a Jehovah’s Witness.

I listed possible problems and difficulties she might have to endure with a husband who was rejoining his old church. Little did I know then that she would soon be going through something ten times worse than I could have ever imagined.

Soon, her new Jehovah's Witness husband would be dragging Beth and her daughter into a new Hell.

A Hell that that has literally killed thousands people over the years.

If she ever had any desire to join this church, it would soon be gone forever, after what would happen next.

Beth called me a few months later, crying; I could barely understand her. I really didn’t know what she needed or wanted. Maybe she needed a shoulder to cry on. I told her we could meet for a cup of coffee.

I had no words for what she would reveal to me.

We met a few hours later at a busy restaurant. I wish you could have seen the look of bewilderment on this poor woman’s face. With tears in her eyes, she sat there. She told me about what had transpired over the last few months since we first talked on the phone.

She said her husband was baptized as he promised. Being re-baptized, he became a zealot once again in his old faith. He didn’t seem to be as interested in her now that he had rejoined his old family and friends. He was now spending less and less time with her, his pregnant wife.

Finally, the baby came. However, there were major complications at birth. It was life or death for the child unless the baby received a blood transfusion. Beth was, of course, in favor of this life-saving option. Her husband was definitely opposed to it.

There were many heated arguments about this. The Elders and his parents got involved. His family informed her husband that he could not waver. There was no way he could give in on this matter. It was more than just a matter of life and death; it was a matter of faith and service to god and obeying His rules about no blood transfusions.

Beth and her family fought her husband to the bitter end. She said he hated her and her stance against him and his faith. This drove a wedge between them even further.

There was no time left and a decision had to be made. For whatever reason, he hung his head in shame and told the doctors to go ahead and give the child a blood transfusion.

The Elders found out that he gave the order for the blood transfusion and were furious. They told him there would be grave repercussions because of his decision.

Two days later, the child died!

The Elders actually told her husband they were not surprised about the child’s death. In a sense, they implied this was a punishment directly from god Himself. This of course was because he had actually disobeyed god’s commandments on the *issue of blood.*

Her husband told the Elders he was wrong and blamed his *worldly wife* for the pressure she had put on him. He begged for Jehovah’s and the Elders forgiveness.

There was nothing I could say to comfort Beth after that story.

Are they still together? I would doubt it.

If you are a Jehovah’s Witness reading this, there are two things I would wonder. First, did god kill the baby because it received a blood transfusion to drive home His point to the disobedient husband? No? Even though the Elders implied that?

Second, Beth will obviously never become a Jehovah’s Witness. Can you really blame her?

If there is a Jehovah, how could He judge her everlasting life in eternity by not being a Jehovah’s Witness when His own people encouraged her husband to leave her and destroy their marriage?

Plus, their god supposedly killed her child because her husband disobeyed Him.

To Beth, the Jehovah’s Witnesses are total whack jobs and she had no desire to drink their *Kool-Aid*....and can you blame her?

This is just one more way the Watchtower Bible & Tract society are *Blood guilty!*

Yes, my friends, once more, *“By their love you will know them.”*

Even though I have been out of the organization for many years, the strange and bizarre stories that swirl around the Jehovah’s Witnesses never seem to stop.

Up until this point, I haven’t even brought up the issue of blood transfusions. There are thousands of stories about people dying because of the Societies’ policy against blood transfusions.

Take a wild guess who dreamt up the idea about no blood transfusions for Jehovah’s Witnesses in the first place?

Charles Russell, the founder of the church? No! Even though blood transfusions were implemented as early as 1914.

Judge Rutherford, the alcoholic and second president? No!

The third president N.H. Knorr? Yes and no, because the fourth President Fred Franz came up with the idea back in 1944 (before he became the fourth president) but newly appointed president Knorr approved of the concept.

God didn’t want to talk to the first two presidents about the blood issue. However, in 1944, thirty years after blood transfusions were initiated, god finally decided to give President Knorr, by way of Fred Franz, the *new light* on the matter of the use of blood.

Since everything produced by the writing department had to be approved by Knorr, here is the wisdom as explained in *The Watchtower.*

*“The blood in any person is in reality the person himself... poisons due to personal living, eating and drinking habits...The poisons that produce the impulse to commit suicide, murder, or steal are in the blood. Moral insanity, sexual perversions, repression, inferiority complexes, petty crimes—these often follow in the wake of blood transfusion.” – Watchtower, September 1, 1961 p.564*

There you have it. More *New Light, God has spoken by way of his earthly representatives.*

When you stop taking the *blue pill*, and you take a step back, you can see the insanity quite clearly.

However, the insanity is not from you receiving a blood transfusion, as they would have you believe. The insanity comes from you eating their contaminated *spiritual food,* which is mixed in with the *blue pills.*

The Society did mention that a blood transfusion could cause “sexual perversions.”

Of course, a person must now wonder if Leo Greenlees, the pervert and *Governing Body member,* ever had a blood transfusion.

This would, of course, explain Leo Greenlees perverse behavior.

Next up Chapter 50 ""The Old Hound Dog Finally Moves""

This will be the Last Chapter in the book *New Boy: Life and Death at the World Headquarters of The Jehovah Witnesses*

The car seat gap filler effectively prevents keys, phones, wallets, and other small items from falling into the hard-to-reach space between the seat and center console.

PART 3 – “The Market That Looped”

The coffee cup was gone again.

He didn’t remember standing.

But his feet were moving.

Through alleys too narrow for trucks, past posters peeling from walls like they were trying to escape.

The city was awake now, or at least pretending to be. People shouted across balconies, argued over vegetables, lit cigarettes that never quite burned down. But beneath all the life, Aarav could feel it—the static.

Something under the city’s skin, buzzing. Not sound. A pressure.

He wandered into the old Mira Bazaar district. A twisting artery of stalls and neon-lit umbrellas, its awnings stitched with rain and light. Narrow passages opened and closed like breathing lungs. Steam coiled off woks. Bright fabrics fluttered beside rusted electronics. But none of it felt alive.

He passed a vendor selling watches on a fold-out table.

“Only two hundred rupees, madam. Real leather. Look—waterproof.”

Aarav glanced over. A woman in a green coat nodded, held one up to her wrist. Smiled.

He kept walking.

Ten seconds later—he passed the same vendor again.

Same line.

Same woman.

Same watch.

His steps slowed.

He turned around.

The woman was gone.

The vendor was folding up his table.

He frowned. Walked a little further.

Then it happened again.

“Only two hundred rupees, madam. Real leather. Look—waterproof.”

He was back at the same stall.

Same exact words.

Only this time, he hadn’t turned around.

He was moving forward.

He backed away, eyes scanning the crowd. Something about the light felt off—colors too saturated, like a dream struggling to render. Faces blurred at the edges, like oil paintings halfway finished.

And there—again.

The man in the red coat.

Down the alley, half-turned, shoulder brushing the edge of a curtain-covered doorway.

Aarav moved.

Fast.

Dodging a man selling bootleg memory chips, ducking past a child holding out gum, weaving through a haze of burning incense and frying oil.

He reached the curtain.

Pulled it back.

Nothing.

No man.

No room.

Just a wall.

Sealed. Brick and concrete. No doorframe. No hinges.

Only the faint echo of wet footsteps retreating behind it—from inside.

He reached out, touched the wall.

It was warm.

Not sun-warm.

Breath-warm.

Something exhaled behind it.

He stepped back.

And that’s when the wall cracked.

Just for a second.

A hairline fracture, spidering out like a web. Light poured through it—not sunlight. Something deeper. Richer. Like memory liquified.

Aarav reached toward it—

—and the wall was gone.

Not shattered.

Not repaired.

Just…

never there.

He was standing in a new place now.

He didn’t know how he got there.

It was under an overpass, half-collapsed, the pillars lined with torn posters of political candidates that hadn’t existed in years. The air was still, as if the wind itself had forgotten how to move.

Aarav turned slowly.

Behind him, the market was gone.

The noise. The smell. The people.

All of it—wiped clean.

In its place: silence.

And across the clearing, leaning against a rain-dark pillar—

was the man.

The red coat rippled slightly, though there was no breeze.

He tilted his head.

Just a little.

And Aarav—without knowing why—whispered:

“I remember this place burning.”

The man stepped backward, into the shadows.

And disappeared.",1,1755352895.0,TaleTrade,0,1.0,False

PART 2 – “You Left Something Open”

The rain felt thinner now, like it wasn’t really falling—just pretending to.

Aarav walked with no destination. Past shuttered shops with flickering lights. Past holographic posters that auto-refreshed with the same five advertisements in rotation. Past people who nodded hello without looking at him.

Everything glimmered with that oddly damp sheen. Not just from the rain—but from being touched too many times by the same memory.

He stopped at a tea stall. Or rather—the tea stall.

The same one on Abner Road. Where the steam always curled the same way. The chai always too sweet. The owner always asleep with one eye half open.

Except this time…

The stall was gone.

No wood. No steam. No tea.

Only a blank patch of sidewalk.

Aarav stood there, confused.

And that’s when the phone in his pocket buzzed.

He frowned.

He didn’t remember a buzz.

He didn’t remember putting a phone in that pocket.

It wasn’t his main one—the burner device he used for work calls. This one was heavier. Warmer. His hand slipped inside and pulled it out slowly, like something feral might bite him through the fabric.

It was an old model. Thick bezels. Scuffed edges. No unlock screen. Just a single message on display:

> YOU’RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.



Below it, a single button: [ ACKNOWLEDGE ]

Aarav stared.

No sender ID. No SIM. No signal bar.

He tapped “Acknowledge.”

Nothing happened.

Then, after a moment—the screen blinked once. The message changed:

> YOU LEFT SOMETHING OPEN.



> IT’S BLEEDING.



He lowered the phone.

The world around him suddenly felt… lighter.

Like something had exhaled nearby. Something large.

He turned.

And in the reflection of the convenience store window across the street, he saw the man again.

Red coat. Still as a cutout.

But when Aarav turned to look directly—

No one.

He looked back at the glass.

The man was still there.

And this time… he raised a finger.

Pointed.

Right at Aarav.

Aarav stepped back, heart thudding once. Twice. Then silence.

He looked down at the phone again. The screen had gone black. Just a faint glow beneath the surface now, like a heartbeat on low battery.

His own reflection wavered beside the red-coated figure’s.

But now the face beside him was… wrong.

It looked like him—but older. Burned. And smiling.

Aarav dropped the phone.

It shattered in slow motion—except it didn’t make a sound.

No crack. No bounce.

Just… gone.

Like it had never been real.

He staggered backward. Eyes sweeping the street. People moved around him—but none of them looked. None of them saw.

None of them reacted to the fact that he had just shattered a phone that wasn’t his, saw a reflection that wasn’t him, and now his hands were shaking like memory was leaking out of his skin.

He caught his breath.

Then a voice—small, familiar—broke the air behind him.

“Sir? Sugar?”

Aarav turned.

And everything broke.

He wasn’t on the street anymore.

He was inside Café Moira.

Same table. Same cracked glass. Same jazz, off by one wrong note.

Same cup of coffee.

Still steaming.

His hand was on it.

The ceramic warm beneath his fingers.

He looked down—and realized…

He was sitting.

He hadn’t sat down. He’d been running. Outside. In the rain. The reflections—

What?

The waiter stood beside him.

Raghav.

Holding the sugar bowl.

Smiling.

“You said that yesterday,” he said, voice soft and exact.

Aarav looked up slowly, breath trapped in his chest.

Through the café window, the rain still fell in perfect lines.

Across the street, the billboard still flickered.

The man with the pigeons still held out crumbs that never ran out.

Same as always.

Same as always.

Same as always.

Aarav’s voice came out hoarse, barely his. “How long have I been here?”

Raghav tilted his head, smile unchanged.

“As long as you haven’t left.”

And then, without transition—without motion—Raghav was gone.

Just the coffee.

Just the sound of jazz.

Just the heat of déjà vu choking the air.

Aarav stood again.

But this time, his chair didn’t creak.

And the coffee… was already full.

As if nothing had happened at all.

1mrw2z9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mrw2z9/i_think_im_the_villain_in_everyones_story/,I think I’m the villain in everyone’s story,"When I (17m) got my first part time job I started to fall in love with a girl (16f), we had similar interests, same ethnicity, almost completely similar people. Even down to qualities that were not great at all. When I turned 18 we officially started dating (she was 17) and this is where my problems began.

I was a porn addict. While growing up I always watched porn since I was 13, even now I struggle with stopping to watch pornography. When we first entered the relationship she asked if I watched pornography, I said yes. I did not try to hide or lie about it I was honest. This was about two months into the relationship. I do not want to get too explicit but my gf at the time was SA when she was younger and was recently dealing with the trauma and the fall out of everything. She would consistently have mood swings, feel upset, get upset with me, and even have panic attacks. I did everything in my power to help her overcome her fears and insecurities about herself, it took a lot of effort however about 6-7 months in the panic attacks finally stopped. However during that time I wanted to end the relationship. I was slowly falling out of love because I felt like I was no longer there for us I was there for her. I felt like I couldn’t leave as I would be afraid she would self harm herself or worse. So I stuck around to make sure she didn’t do any harm to herself while slowly falling out of love. At around the 8 month mark she old me very clearly she was not comfortable with me watching pornography. She set up a clear boundary and I said I would stop viewing pornography.

The feeling I get when I view pornography is a feeling I have never been able to replicate. I feel that when I am turned on nothing else to me matters. I throw all morals out the window and stop thinking for a couple minutes of Pleasure. I admit-tingly could not control myself.

During the nine month mark she found that I was viewing pornography again. She asked me to stop and I told her I would, this started a cycle of her being insecure. She would tell me how uncomfortable it would make her and that she felt awkward asking me to stop as I should have already. This started what I’d like to call the cycle of hate between us.

I did what I could to stop my addiction. I would delete any pornography I had on any social media sites. I throughly went through any saved files, photos, posts, anything even relating to pornography I cut out. Yet when I was alone at the middle of the night I would watch it. I would even have sex multiple times and still watch pornography at the end of the day. At this time my ex girlfriend at the time would start doing things to upset me on purpose. During the 11 month mark she asked me for my social media passwords. I gave it up willingly because I was determined to quit pornography. I cannot explain the feeling but things had started to quiet down after giving her my social media. I was falling back in love after a long time, I was finding myself happy in the relationship and found that life without pornography isn’t bad. However this is where I believe that the relationship took a bad turn.

During Christmas time we took a trip together, everyday for a whole week we would have an argument that ended in someone crying. It got to a point where my relatives started asking if everything was okay. We were working through it and eventually started making progress. Every argument was because of insecurities in our relationship including looks, at the time I was not watching pornography. During new years I viewed pornography, in order to avoid a fight I started to hide it. I did not want her to feel upset with me or end the relationship so I hid it, she found out less than two days later. She asked me to start attending therapy and I agreed.

I started to go to therapy in January of this year, honestly I feel that the process has not helped very much in my addiction process but it has helped a little bit. During this time me and my ex split up from our store and went to different stores in the same company. I had gotten a promotion while she had stayed in the same position, which is why we had to go to different stores. This is important later.

I started to go to therapy, however I was still watching pornography. Not as much but maybe once a week? Me and my ex had talks about how if I would watch it I would tell her. I did not ever tell her because I was scared. It had gotten to a point where even a small sexual joke or a comment would trigger her insecurities. It had gotten to a point where I began walking around on eggshells with her, not only because of pornography but because I did not want to lose her and get into arguments. During February she caught me watching pornography and had a breakdown. She told me everything that was wrong and why she had been upset all the time the last two months. I promised her I would continue to go to therapy and that we can work it out.

She began to act differently, she started doing things to purposely hurt me. She would start hiding that she was hanging out with other men alone. These “hangouts” were dates her friends had set up for her. I only found out in march when she hid the fact she was going on a date with her friend’s older brother (my age). The only reason I found out was because she told me a week prior to the group date with the friends. I would like to also add I was never invited to hangout with her friends. I never met them, never saw them, only heard stories through my ex at the time. This really hurt me and I explained why it upset me, however it was all done on purpose. The day of the date she left early as she told me she felt so bad about not inviting me that she faked illness. However the week after that it was another case of a date her friends had set up for her, however she told me and declined. This on top of constant arguing over small things and everything always being my fault caused me to spiral into a depression during march. I had gone back to watching pornography in a sorry attempt to make myself happier. It only got worse over time as she would constantly argue with me, make me feel bad, downplay on my own insecurities and made me feel horrible.

During this time I had to do a training for my job with her coworker, I had shaken his hand, gave him my number, talked to him like a friend and worked with him a couple times at my job. When I visited her workplace I could tell he liked her. I’m not sure how to explain it but it is like when someone acts different around someone they like. I had told her very forward that I am not comfortable with them texting each other, even about work. I was forward and told her that he liked her and asked them to stop contact because it made me uncomfortable. She told me no and that it would make a hostile work environment so I let it go. What she declined to tell me was that he would buy her coffee everyday, every shift, just for the two of them.

Also during this spiral of depression I was going through family issues. My mother was diagnosed with cancer the year prior and things had started to come to a boiling point. She is still constantly sick and not feeling well but I was always there to support her.

Then in April I began watching pornography heavily. To the point where I would watch porn no matter if I had sex 1000 times in a day. My ex had taken notice as she had try to increase the amount of sex we had almost 10x. We went from 3-4 times a week to 2-3 times a day. I even started to get ED because of how much I was viewing pornography. Well during April I had done one of the worst things I could have done and viewed pornography openly with her on the phone with me viewing my screen. I know how horrible it is and I understand my mistake. This led to us separating for good in April of this year. Shortly after we again tried to put the pieces together (not even a week later) and on the drive home from work at 1 am this coworker called her. She told me he was calling and hung up the phone on me. She talked to him for an hour straight at 1 am and acted like nothing was wrong less than week after separating. Being honest, I was the most depressed I had ever been in my life. I was at an all time low I didn’t eat, didn’t go to work, didn’t have passion for almost anything. I did everything in my power to mend the relationship, I offered couples therapy, more frequent therapy, I got her gifts, wrote letters everything I could. We had a long talk in may and I did everything I could to ask her to stay and she said no. She told me it got to a point where she would do things on purpose to hurt me so I could see how it felt. She told me she was aware of everything and that she was playing dumb to hurt my feelings. Hearing that hurt me to a point where I was severely depressed. I took a month long vacation to my home country with my family to get away from where I am. When I came back low and behold the coworker she told me not to worry about we’re dating with a caption “I love you so much” at this point it had been less than 60 days than we had separated. She made sure to keep their post at the top of the page, put their users in their biography, all her friends commented under their post (never under ours). And purposely made sure I saw the post by telling our mutual friends about it and to tell me. She then proceeded to tell all of them at work I cheated on her.

I know I am the villain in most iterations of the story but I hope atleast someone can see it from my point of view. It has now been officially four months since we separated and I still think about  her more than ever. I don’t check her profiles on social media anymore and she has blocked me and my mother. My mother didn’t deserve a block as she even gave her a home when she didn’t have any. I’ve been going to therapy for the last four months, However my therapist recently passed away and it has me concerned about my well being. Has made me think about the situation a thousand times over.

When we separated I made her a list of things I would do to get better. At the end of August this month I will be done with the list. Part of me wants to tell her while the other thinks I should leave her alone.",1,1755352818.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Having dealt with sluggish internet connections and outdated network adapters for way too long, I was quite excited to see how this small gadget could bring WiFi 6 magic to my life. Boasting dual-band connectivity, MU-MIMO capability, and speeds up to 1800 Mbps, it certainly promised a lot on paper. Trust me, I put it through its paces to see if it could actually live up to those claims.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This USB adapter has a compact yet purposeful design, fitting nicely into the array of modern tech gadgets. Its dimensions—just 1.18 x 0.75 x 4.01 inches—make it portable and sleek, but it’s the foldable adjustable antenna that stands out. I found it surprisingly handy for tweaking signal reception. The included wired bracket gave even more flexibility by letting me place the device on my desk to avoid interference. While at first glance it might appear a bit plasticky, the construction felt solid enough for everyday use. My toddler gave the antenna the ""grab and yank"" test, and I’m happy to report it survived intact!  

**Performance Under Real-Life Use Cases**  
Honestly, what grabbed my attention was its ability to support both the 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands. In my own experience, the 5GHz band clocked some incredible speeds—perfect for my work-from-home setup when juggling HD video calls and file sharing. Meanwhile, the 2.4GHz band proved reliable when I wandered farther from my router, delivering a stable connection in areas five-room deep in my house. It tackled tasks like streaming movies and online gaming without any noticeable hiccups. Plus, the beamforming technology made a real difference by bolstering the signal strength where I needed it most. I no longer stood awkwardly holding my laptop near the router for better speeds—absolute win.

**Setup and Installation**  
Setting it up was refreshingly simple. I plugged it into my USB 3.0 port and was thrilled to see that it supported plug-and-play functionality. Within seconds, my desktop discovered my home WiFi 6 network. I didn’t even need to fumble with driver installations because Windows 10 recognized it immediately. For someone like me who cringes at overly technical setup handbooks, this was a lifesaver. And yes, it even worked smoothly on my Linux laptop after a quick driver download.

**WPA3 Security Features**  
As someone conscious about online security, I was impressed by the WPA3 encryption offered here. Whether browsing in a coffee shop, booking flights, or binge-watching my favorite series, I felt reassured knowing my data was safer against potential threats. While WPA3 might sound like just another technical jargon, I genuinely think this feature adds much-needed peace of mind for casual users and professionals alike.

**Key Benefits**  
Several positives stood out:
- The adapter supports WiFi 6, delivering better speeds and efficiency compared to older standards.  
- Dual-band connectivity provided versatile performance, both for short-range high-speed tasks and reliable long-range connections.  
- Its compact size and adjustable folding antenna made it incredibly practical for on-the-go users.  
- Compatibility across various systems extended its usability—even worked seamlessly on my friend’s slightly older laptop.  

**Hurdles I Noticed**  
Every product has its quirks, and here’s what I felt could’ve been better:
- The plastic finish, while sturdy, lacked the premium feel you’d expect at its price range.  
- It doesn’t naturally cater to macOS users, as compatibility seemed limited there.  
- Signal stability dipped slightly during heavy multi-device usage, though it still outperformed the adapters I’ve used before.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing it to other popular WiFi adapters, like NETGEAR’s AX1800 USB adapter and TP-Link’s Archer T9, I noticed some trade-offs. The MSI unit offered better ease of installation and a stronger focus on user-adjustable antennas. Where it lagged, though, was in build quality compared to the hardier feel of competing models. Yet, for users wanting a fast setup without endless driver installations, this adapter excels. 

**Affordable Quality**  
Pricing can be tricky for tech like this, especially when newer standards like WiFi 6 often carry a premium. However, I found the cost justified considering the features—speed, performance, and WPA3 encryption. While some other models may offer similar features at slightly higher or lower costs, this adapter balances quality and practicality effectively. For anyone needing an instant network upgrade without swapping out their router or PC hardware, it’s worth a look.

We would go to events together, pub nights, clubbing sometimes, beach days. Obviously I ended up hanging out with him one on one and we slept together then things moved to dating and I have honestly been pretty happy so far up until one of our mutual friends wanted to get a coffee with me and catch up. 

This friend told me that roughly 3 weeks prior to me getting with my boyfriend that he and my best friend had caught up at their place with a couple of other people and that she had overheard my boyfriend confess he was inlove with my best friend towards the end of the night and they ended up sleeping together. 

Obviously I was shocked by this, cut the hangout very short with this mutual friend and said that I wish they had just kept that information to themselves because all that has done is made me feel extremely Insecure. 

My bestfriend knew for a long time I had feelings for that guy and I had asked her if she fancied him prior to even considering him a option, she said no. 

I drove to my boyfriends house to get some things like my laptop I wanted a couple of days to myself to just process my emotions, didn't think he would be there (I know where the spare key is) he was there, I just let myself in said hey and that I wanted to grab my laptop and just go back to mine, walked passed him without much acknowledgement to get to the bedroom, he followed me in and asked if everything is okay. 

I told him everything was not okay and that I had just had a coffee with mutal friend and they informed me about what happened between you and bestfriend, at that event a couple of weeks before we got together. He was quiet for a minute while I was looking for my charger I wasn't looking at him at all and then he just said that friend should not have told you that. 

I said yeah she shouldn't have but now I know so I'm just gonna leave now and I'll talk to you in a couple of days, he went in to hug me from behind and I shrugged him off, he said I was being really cold. I said you should know by now I don't like being touched when I'm upset and to be honest I don't want to be touched by you right now. Left without saying much else. 

Sent my friend a message letting her know, that I know what happend between them both and that I don't want to catch up this week. 

Got home, got drunk, cried and honestly just feel really gross I don't know why exactly I just feel decieved and embarassed, I'm trying to deal with my emotions in a healthy way on my own. I think for me the fact he told her, he loved her is such a big thing to say, I feel like he only dated me because the person he wanted didn't want him other than a hookup and she kept quiet about it to spare my feelings. Both my close friend and boyfriend have tried calling me and sent me way to many messages I haven't responded to anything. I don't have anything to say at this point other than I might go interstate for a week or so to visit a relative and get some perspective.

PART 1 – “The Coffee Never Cools”

The rain had been falling for twenty-six days.

Aarav counted. Not because he was obsessive, but because the rain didn’t change. Not once. Same cold drizzle. Same windless drift against the windowpanes of the city. It was the kind of rain that didn’t refresh—just accumulated, like forgotten debt.

He sat in his usual spot at the Café Moira, corner window seat, table by the cracked glass, sipping coffee that never seemed to cool. The jazz on the stereo was the same as yesterday. So was the barista's smile. So were the customers.

The same old man with the chessboard. The same woman in the trench coat tapping her phone with surgical anxiety. The same teenager pretending not to cry over something scribbled in a notebook.

And outside?

Same man feeding the same pigeons. Same dog limping past the same trash can. Aarav knew this because he had watched them yesterday. And the day before. And the day before that.

Time, he suspected, had given up.

He took another sip. The coffee was still hot. Not steaming—but never cold.

He stared out through the water-streaked glass at the static street. Across the intersection, a billboard flickered with a broken ad for memory implants. The smiling couple on it hadn’t blinked in three weeks.

“Sir?” came a familiar voice. “You want sugar?”

Aarav looked up. The waiter—Raghav—stood holding a bowl of sugar packets. He had a faint scar near his left eye. Aarav had noticed it on Day Eleven. A nick shaped like a comma.

“I don’t take sugar,” Aarav said, voice low.

“You said that yesterday,” Raghav replied.

He smiled. Walked away.

Aarav didn’t smile back. He looked down at his phone. No messages. No missed calls. No notifications. But the battery never dropped below 62%.

It was always at 62%.

The jazz track looped. The same wrong piano note at the thirty-eight second mark.

He ran a hand through his hair. Closed his eyes. Opened them again.

The coffee was still hot.

Across the street, a bus passed by.

When it cleared… there was a man standing where it had been.

Red coat. No umbrella. Unmoving.

He stared at Aarav through the glass. His face wasn’t visible—too much shadow, too much distortion from the rain. But he didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

Aarav blinked instead.

And when he opened his eyes—the man was gone.

Aarav stood.

The chair creaked under him. The sound was jarring, like a break in a song that had been playing for too long.

He left money on the table. No one acknowledged it.

He stepped out into the rain.

The water hit his face like it was trying to remind him he was alive. He crossed the street, stepping around the same crack in the pavement he always did.

No man. No sign of anyone.

Only a faint ripple in a puddle—like someone had just moved through it.

Aarav turned slowly.

And from somewhere deep inside him, something cold whispered:

“Something here is repeating you.”

I am in relationship with a man older than me 12 years. Since about 2 months we have terrible fights.

I feel like he pushes my buttons by doing/saying the things that hurt me  until I explode. Then he says that I cross his boundaries and he abandons me in a complete mental breakdown. He ignores me, my calls, my messages. I beg for mercy, I beg him for help, for not leaving me alone, but he totally ignores it. He sees only him, he talks only how about I impact him. He totally skips the part how did he brought me to this state. He says I don’t understand him. He doesn’t want to listen that there is a problem. I heard about reactive abuse and it feels like a perfect description of what happens. Right now he abandoned me on vacations he organized, after I said (very calmly) that some of his behaviors from the past (from extremely bad fights with me lashing out, him ignoring, blocking me, leaving me alone etc.) have hurt me and I find them unfair (and he asked me to talk about that, said I can tell everything). I tried to deescalate it, proposed that I will go out of the room, grab a coffee, leave us the room to calm down. But he kept repeating “I’m packing and leaving”, pushed me again to my mental edge and then left. Don’t understand me wrong - I don’t say I am perfect. I don’t say my reactions are fine (like me hitting myself, or for the first time in 10 years I’ve cut my skin again). I want to work on them, I wanna do the therapy of traumas that is offered in the country I am living in. I am under a supervision of psychiatrist and psychologist. But I can’t anymore with such a behavior on his side too. I do not understand how a person can be so cold blooded and ignore when someone ask him for mercy and help. He says he doesn’t believe me (I never lied to him or did sth to come across as a liar). I don’t understand how a person can react with “we should end all”, “I am leaving”, “all the time the same happens” when hearing they hurt us. For me the only healthy answer is “I am sorry, what can I do to do better?”. For so long I tried to justify, understand him, change myself. But I am so tired that the focus is on my reaction, and not on what caused it. I am emotionally devastated, in one mental meltdown after another.

My routine use is for 2-3 cortadoes a day. I love it and I've never had problems with creating hot milk-based espresso (for anyone wondering if the single boiler is okay with me).

1mrvtha,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mrvtha/uncover_the_delonghi_water_filter_dlsc002_review/,Uncover the DeLonghi Water Filter DLSC002 review for better-tasting coffee experience!,"Using the De'Longhi DLSC002 Replacement Water Filter daily has been quite an eye-opener for me. Drinking coffee is a morning ritual in my house, and ensuring every cup tastes just right is a priority. This BPA-free filter claims to optimize water quality, reduce limescale, and extend the life of espresso machines. While using it in my De'Longhi espresso maker, I noticed a significant difference in the flavor of my coffee. The smoothness and clarity of the brew were remarkable. For a genuine coffee enthusiast like myself, such improvements are not minor—they’re transformative.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I appreciated about this water filter is its compact structure. Measuring only 2.36""D x 3.15""W x 7.87""H and weighing a mere 4 ounces, it fits snugly into the compatible espresso machine models without taking up extra space. Its plastic exterior might feel a touch lightweight, but it’s certainly sturdy enough for its role. I’ve handled various filters in the past, and this one never felt flimsy, even after months of regular use.

**Ease of Installation**  
Installing this filter is refreshingly easy. I tested it with my De'Longhi Magnifica ECAM22110SB, and the process took less than five minutes. No tools, no awkward maneuvering—just a direct and seamless fit. The instructions are straightforward, so even someone unfamiliar with espresso machine maintenance could handle this.

**Improved Coffee Quality**  
I shared a cup of coffee with some friends, and they were surprised by how flavorful it was. The internal active carbon and ion-exchange technology in this filter efficiently trap unwanted chemicals and aromas. Having hard tap water in my area, this filter noticeably softened the water, leading to a tastier brew. It’s perfect not only for espresso but for any coffee drinker aiming for the highest quality.

[Discover if De'Longhi DLSC002 is on sale at Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b00cxq9gq8/)

**Performance and Durability**  
Using it over the course of months, I haven’t noticed any dip in its effectiveness. If maintained as suggested, the filter does as advertised—reducing limescale and, by extension, the frequency of machine descaling. This means the espresso maker stays in top condition longer, something I’ve seen firsthand as it consistently produces the same coffee quality as it did on day one.

**Advantages**  
- Enhances coffee flavor by improving water quality.  
- Significantly reduces limescale build-up to protect your espresso machine.  
- Easy to install, even for first-timers.  
- Lightweight, compact, and fits snugly into compatible machines.  

**Hurdles**  
- Works only with select espresso machines, limiting compatibility.  
- Requires regular replacement, which might be inconvenient for some users.  

**Competing Brands**  
Looking into alternative filters, I’ve tried options like the Brita Intenza+ and Saeco AquaClean. While these filters also focus on water quality, they tend to lean more towards being universal options rather than tailored for specific machines. The De'Longhi replacement water filter stands out in how it perfectly integrates with De'Longhi espresso makers, making it highly specialized. That said, Brita’s filters are often reusable for longer stretches, and Saeco ones come with an auto-alert feature for maintenance, which this product doesn’t offer.

**Budget-Friendly Choice**  
The pricing is competitive for what it offers. Comparing it to other De'Longhi accessories I’ve purchased in the past, the value shines through in how it efficiently extends machine life and enhances coffee quality. Given its premium performance, the cost feels justified to me.

1mrvsx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1mrvsx8/should_you_buy_the_best_cold_brew_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best Cold Brew Coffee Maker from KitchenAid,"The KitchenAid KCM5912SX Cold Brew Coffee Maker is one of those products that managed to surprise me despite my initial skepticism. As someone who cherishes a rich glass of cold brew coffee, I’ve gone through countless coffee makers over the years. From single-serve plastic gadgets to overly elaborate brewing stations, I’ve tested it all. The moment I unboxed this model, the brushed stainless steel design and the reassuring weight of the components set the stage for an experience that felt more premium than most other options I’ve tried.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek and compact design immediately caught my eye. It fits snugly into the refrigerator and doesn’t hog countertop space, an essential feature for me since kitchen real estate is constantly at a premium. The use of glass and stainless steel not only looks high-end but also ensures that my coffee never acquires an odd plastic taste—a major pet peeve with cheaper coffee makers. The carrying handle adds to its usability when relocating between fridge and counter, which might sound trivial but makes a difference in daily use. The tap for dispensing is a standout feature that more coffee gear should have. It’s a smooth, no-drip mechanism that pours coffee without any mess.

**Ease of Use and Brewing Options**  
This coffee maker simplifies the process to the point where anyone can brew like a pro. Fill the glass carafe with filtered water, add freshly ground coffee to the reusable steel mesh steeper, and just let time work its magic. The fill-level indicators on the steeper remove guesswork, and that’s particularly helpful if you’ve ever overdone the coffee-to-water ratio—something I used to struggle with. Cold brewing does take a minimum of 12 hours, so keep that in mind if you’re impatient. The concentrated coffee it produces can last up to two weeks, making it ideal for batch brewing. Whether I’m mixing up iced lattes or smoothies, the coffee concentrate stays fresh and flavorful throughout those two weeks.

[Don’t miss KitchenAid KCM5912SX deals—check Amazon here.](https://maisea.com/p/b07g4w8s7k/)

**Positives**  
The product offers plenty of small yet significant features that improve the experience. Here are a few major strengths:  
- Reusable stainless steel steeper reduces waste and is easy to clean.  
- Compact design that conveniently fits inside fridges without commandeering space.  
- Glass and stainless-steel construction does wonders for preserving the authentic taste of cold brew coffee.  
- Built-in tap system is functional and prevents spills.  

**Negative Attributes**  
Despite everything, it’s not perfect. There are a few shortcomings to consider:  
- 12-hour brewing time could be too long for anyone craving immediate results.  
- At nearly seven pounds, it’s heavier than simple pitchers and can feel bulky when moving between fridge shelves.  

**Taste Quality and Brewing Performance**  
Cold brew enthusiasts often fuss over the richness of the flavor, and I can confirm this brewer delivers the smooth, robust taste you’re looking for. Since the reusable metal filter is so finely meshed, there’s no risk of grit sneaking into the final brew. The coffee emerges clean, balanced, and full-bodied. I tried mixing the concentrate with almond milk and later with vanilla oat creamer, and both varieties were equally delightful. For purists who stick to black coffee, this brewer is a dream. It retains the nuances of roasts without turning bitter—a common issue I’ve faced with more basic cold-brew alternatives.

**Build to Handle Busy Lifestyles**  
Durability is another area where this coffee maker outshines its rivals. Glass, while stylish, can often feel fragile, but this product's thick-walled design inspires confidence. Unlike flimsy plastic models, which are prone to cracking or warping over time, the KitchenAid cold brewer seems built to last for years. Its portability also makes it travel-friendly for those weekend trips when you don't want to sacrifice the luxury of a homemade cold brew.

**Competing Products**  
Having compared this model to some of its market rivals, like the Takeya Cold Brew Maker or the OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker, it becomes clear where KitchenAid has the edge. The Takeya model wins in affordability and weight but loses marks due to its all-plastic construction, which doesn’t quite capture the essence and flavor of a premium coffee. Meanwhile, the OXO Good Grips boasts an excellent brewing consistency but falls short in ease of dispensing, as it lacks a built-in tap. The balance of aesthetics, functionality, and flavor preservation gives KitchenAid’s cold brew maker a distinct advantage for anyone who wants professional-level results without venturing into a café.

**Bang for the Buck**  
While it isn’t the cheapest option you’ll encounter, the price-to-quality ratio tilts firmly in its favor. What you’re investing in is not just a coffee maker but an appliance that feels thoughtfully engineered for people who genuinely care about their beverages. If you value sustainability, the reusable components will save you money and waste in the long run, making it a cost-effective choice. Throw in that it’s quite stylish, and you’ve got a product that stands up to daily use without feeling like a chore to maintain.

1mrvqko,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tariffs-blame-40-spike-wholesale-vegetable-prices-experts/story?id=124684249,Are tariffs to blame for nearly 40% spike in wholesale vegetable prices? Experts weigh in,"Wholesale prices soared much faster than economists expected last month, stoking concern among some economists about an eventual pass through to consumer prices.

- The fresh government data this week showed an eye-popping 38% surge in the wholesale price of vegetables in July, the biggest price spike for any product category. A continued rise of that magnitude could noticeably hike vegetable prices at restaurants and grocery stores within a matter of months, some analysts told ABC News.

- The latest report came as consumers await a possible burst of inflation as President Donald Trump's tariffs take hold. Importers typically offset the tax burden in the form of higher prices for shoppers, though so far tariff-induced price increases have proven marginal.

- When asked about whether the jump in vegetable prices had resulted from tariffs, analysts shrugged. Wholesale vegetable prices often fluctuate from month to month, they said, pointing to an array of possible explanations that includes adverse weather, supply chain blockages and tariff-induced cost increases.

- ""People are really curious about when tariffs are likely to have consequences for consumers. We're all keeping an eye out,"" Parke Wilde, a food economist at Tufts University, told ABC news. ""But I don't want to jump the gun based on one segment of one index.""

- The U.S. imports more than a third of its fresh vegetables, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data released in January. A product category made up of such a sizable chunk of imports is vulnerable to tariff-induced wholesale price increases, some analysts said.

- Importers of perishable foods like vegetables face an especially acute challenge because they cannot stockpile products ahead of tariffs, since the fresh produce would rot. Toy or apparel retailers, by contrast, could fill warehouses with products imported at pre-tariff rates.

- ""This could be the impact of tariffs,"" David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University, told ABC News. ""But it could be a whole host of things.""

- Sweetgreen, a restaurant chain that primarily sells salads and grain bowls, earlier this month faulted tariffs in part for a 3.6 percentage-point decline in restaurant-level profit over three months ending in June, when compared to the same period a year earlier.

- Still, analysts said, the spike in wholesale prices may be the result of factors unrelated to tariffs.

- Adverse weather may have caused a supply shortage for a host of crops, leading to an upward swing in producer prices.

- A similar product category, coffee, has undergone a rise in price over the past year due to droughts in Brazil and Vietnam, analysts previously told ABC News. Coffee prices climbed more than 14% over the year ending in July, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed. Tariffs could exacerbate those price woes, the analysts said.

- The Trump administration's immigration policy may have also contributed to the rise in wholesale vegetable prices, since a possible worker shortage could have pushed up wages, causing sellers to raise prices in an effort to offset those added costs, some analysts said.

- The Trump administration has pursued a restrictive immigration policy that features the detention of undocumented immigrants at work sites and the revocation of Temporary Protected Status – a form of temporary legal status – for hundreds of thousands of immigrants.

- Roughly two-thirds of agricultural workers say they are non-citizen immigrants, according to a KFF analysis of a U.S. Labor Department survey conducted in 2022.

- ""There have been a lot of immigration raids across the country. Those could be impacting workers wanting to go into the field to harvest. And that could drive labor costs up and increase the prices of these items,"" Ortega said.

- In June, Trump told Fox News that the administration was developing a permit that would allow some immigrant workers, including agricultural employees, to retain legal status. Trump had previously reversed an effort to afford legal protection to agricultural workers.

- To be sure, the spike in wholesale vegetable prices last month did not cause a jump in prices paid by shoppers. Vegetable prices faced by consumers went unchanged from June to July, government data showed

- Over the past year, vegetable prices have risen only 0.2%, well below the overall inflation rate of 2.7%. That overall inflation rate stands below the level when Trump took office in January.

- ""Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury's coffers. Also, it has been shown that, for the most part, Consumers aren't even paying these Tariffs, it is mostly Companies and Governments, many of them Foreign, picking up the tabs,"" Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday.

- If the current rise in wholesale vegetable prices were to carry over for a few months, then shoppers would begin to notice higher prices, analysts said.

- Wilde, of Tufts University, said consumer price hikes under such a scenario could exceed 10%.

- ""That would be a large price increase,"" Wilde said. ""For now, we don't know. It's something to monitor.""",10,1755352007.0,Defeat_Project_2025,1,0.92,False

1mrvplt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1mrvplt/spotlight_best_countertop_ice_maker_dumos_and_is/,Spotlight best countertop ice maker DUMOS and is it worth it,"The DUMOS Ice Maker Countertop Ice Machine Compact Size with Handle, Black, has become an unexpected star in my kitchen. Its sleek design and surprisingly robust performance kept me pleasantly entertained while churning out ice cubes for all kinds of beverages. I wasn’t planning to invest in an ice maker initially, but when I stumbled upon this countertop wonder, the promise of hassle-free ice-making changed my mind.

**Design and Portability**  
The first thing that caught my eye was its compact build paired with a convenient handle. At just 15.4 pounds, moving it from the kitchen counter to the patio was completely hassle-free. Its dimensions, 8.8 x 11.6 x 12.5 inches, are perfect for small spaces like apartments or RV countertops. The transparent window on top added a nice touch, letting me watch the ice being made. Black appliances usually blend well into kitchen decor, but this one didn’t just blend—it popped in an understatedly chic way.

**Efficient Ice Production**  
Watching this machine in action was impressive. In just six minutes, nine bullet-shaped ice cubes appeared like magic. I happened to test the device during a backyard party, and it delivered consistently, producing up to 26 pounds of ice in 24 hours. Gone are the days of rushing to the corner store for melting bags of ice. Plus, the bullet-shaped design? Genius! The smooth edges mean no awkward chunks scraping against teeth—just soft, perfectly cool relief.

**Pros**  
- Makes nine ice cubes in only six minutes, ensuring no one waits too long.  
- Two ice size options tailored to different needs.  
- Compact and lightweight design with a handle for easy mobility.  

[Check DUMOS Ice Maker Countertop Ice Machine Compact Size with Handle, Black price on Amazon.](https://chvnx.com/p/b0drdbqvbq/)

**User-Friendly Operation**  
I have to admit, I’m skeptical about gadgets boasting of “smart” features, but this ice maker lives up to the hype. Its straightforward control panel won me over in no time. Even my tech-challenged family members managed to operate it without needing a video tutorial. The best surprise? It wasn't just smart but also considerate. The indicator lights turned on whenever water levels were low or the ice basket reached capacity. And the cherry on top? It worked quietly, with noise levels beneath 40dB, making it easy to forget it’s running.

**Ice Cube Versatility**  
One underrated feature was its ability to churn out two distinct ice cube sizes. I used small ice cubes to keep some shrimp fresh for lunch, and for my post-lunch iced coffee indulgence, the larger cubes worked wonders. It was a revelation—large cubes cooled drinks instantly without diluting them too quickly.

**Maintenance Made Easy**  
The self-cleaning function on this countertop ice maker deserves a standing ovation. Pressing the on/off button for five seconds starts the self-clean cycle, making cleanup immensely simple. Particularly for someone like me—the queen of putting off chores—it has been a lifesaver. No residue, no fuss, just clean, ready-to-go ice every time.

**Benefits**  
- Extremely quiet operation ensuring a peaceful environment.  
- Smart indicators for low water and full basket notifications.  
- Transparent lid to monitor the process, adding a fun touch while waiting for ice.  

**Disadvantages**  
That being said, nothing’s perfect. While the perks outweigh the cons, there were a few quirks:  
- Slightly slower for large-scale events requiring immediate ice; long-term capacity is great, but immediate output may feel slow.  
- Small water tank capacity means frequent refills during heavy use. 

**Alternative Products**  
While the DUMOS Ice Maker impressed me thoroughly, I couldn’t resist sizing it up against other compact options available in the market. A rival like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker came to mind, as it offers chewable ice with an elegant layout. However, it’s a hefty machine in both cost and size, lacking the portability that makes DUMOS shine. On the other hand, smaller models like the Igloo ICEB26HN come close in compact design but lose out on easy handling without a built-in carry handle. While Igloo makes a solid choice for stationary kitchens, its noise level often fails to keep up with the DUMOS's whisper-quiet operation.

**Best Value**  
Considering its price against competitors, the DUMOS Ice Maker delivers exceptional value. The ability to make up to 26 pounds of ice daily, paired with dual-size cube options, a carry handle, and self-cleaning functionality, easily beats out more expensive counterparts. Plus, its quiet operation and ease of use make it an absolute steal. For someone on a moderate budget like me, it’s priced just right without losing out on premium features.

I go up there and they only hand me one drink then walks away with the other, so I call after them something like ""um, I think that's my drink."" (Not loud...tone was innocent and genuine, I genuinely thought it was my drink) and as I'm saying it another employee like jump-turns around to face me, and raised his voice, and said (in a very pushy and condescending way) ""actually sir IM making your drink right now if YOU could just be PATIENT.""

....I wasn't impatient, I was mistaken. I guess the other drink was for drive-thru, (I didn't say anything) but I think its kinda dumb they made me wait longer and let someone else's drink sit there melting in the drive thru pickup line, rather than giving me that one first. And the guy who kinda yelled at me was so intense, kept bugging his eyes and staring at me like he was sure I was a Karen, couldn't possibly have been confused by the employee holding my order, saying my order is done, then walking away with half of it. 🤷‍♂️

Not like im really complaining about the employees performance, only about the one who came at me, but ftr in all my customer service jobs I never handed out a partial order without an explanation, ""here are your burgers, and I'll be right back with the fries"" ""your drink is being prepared now, we call for you when it's ready"".

1mrvlbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1mrvlbh/explore_the_best_singleserve_espresso_machine/,Explore the Best Single-Serve Espresso Machine Breville Offers,"Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1 Nespresso Essenza Mini has become an integral part of my mornings. This espresso machine fits perfectly on my kitchen counter with its slim, compact design. Measuring just 3.3 inches deep, 8 inches wide, and standing 12.9 inches tall, it doesn’t devour counter space like bulky coffee makers. Its sleek black matte finish adds a touch of sophistication to my minimalist kitchen setup, and it feels solid despite its lightweight 5.95-pound body. The ergonomic design—like easy-access buttons—felt intuitive from the first time I used it, making the machine incredibly user-friendly.

**Strengths**  

- The compact size is perfect for small kitchens or apartments.  
- The fast heat-up system brews espresso in minutes.  
- Automatically shuts off after nine minutes to save power.  
- Two programmable cup sizes cater to both espresso and lungo.  

The two-button interface lets me choose between espresso or lungo, and the machine consistently delivers velvety, high-quality coffee. The high-pressure pump ensures every cup is rich in flavor, and the included milk frother produces the creamiest foam for lattes and cappuccinos. I cannot overstate how smooth and frothy my coffee has been since switching to this maker.  

[Ready to snag Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1? See Amazon’s price.](https://sohdu.com/p/b073zht2fm/)  

**Performance That Impresses**  

Each morning, I appreciate the speed of this fully automatic espresso machine. It heats up quickly and is ready to go in mere seconds. The high-pressure pump extracts a full-bodied coffee base, ensuring the perfect aroma with each brew. I noticed no compromise in flavor compared to pricier alternatives, and the operation is whisper-quiet, which means I don’t wake anyone else in the house while making my early morning coffee. However, descaling the machine feels necessary every few weeks if you're using non-filtered water, as espresso machines can be sensitive to buildup.

**Ease of Maintenance**  

Cleaning this compact espresso maker turned out to be easier than expected. The removable drip tray, water tank, and capsule container all detach efficiently. The welcome kit included detailed instructions that were easy to follow. For all the convenience it offers, I found it a bit messy when ejecting used capsules into the container; sometimes, stray liquid drips. I used a small towel to solve that, but I would love a minor design tweak here.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  

- The water tank capacity of 20.3 fl oz may require frequent refills if used for multiple cups.  
- The milk frother isn’t directly attached, meaning an extra accessory to store.  
- Capsule disposal can feel slightly clunky at times.  

For an espresso lover like me, the no-fuss simplicity outweighs these minor caveats. With the eco-mode switching off the machine after nine minutes of inactivity, it’s one less thing to worry about as I head out the door to work.

**Rival Brands**  

Over the years, I’ve compared many single-serve brewers, including De’Longhi’s compact espresso machines. Both Breville and De’Longhi are strong contenders in the market, but what sets the Nespresso Essenza Mini apart is its superior compactness. While the De’Longhi Dedica series offers slightly larger water tanks, it falls short in offering such an intuitive user interface with the same minimal counter footprint. Some higher-end machines offer drink customization options, but they also cost significantly more.  

**Money’s Worth**  

This espresso machine punches above its price tag in terms of quality and durability. Its energy-saving mode, fast heating element, and premium brewing technology make it a clear value champion. It’s budget-friendly for anyone who wants a reliable, compact coffee maker for daily use. However, the recurring cost of Nespresso pods could be a budget consideration for some users. That said, using the reusable capsule alternatives could help long-term savings while cutting down on waste.

I’m 31, Dubliner, no kids, non-smoker, and house-trained. Looking for companionship to broaden my perspective, find my tribe, and maybe take over the known universe along the way. 🤞

By day I’m a compooper whisperer. By nature I’m the guy who tidies up at parties, volunteers behind the scenes, and brings a calm presence while others figure themselves out. I listen more than I talk, but when I open up it’s with warmth, dry wit, and goofiness. 

I like fixing things that probably aren’t broken, and sometimes take dancing lessons, (paused for now, but open to a partner). Sometimes Coronation Street makes up the background noise while I tinker with my Steam Deck. Sports aren’t my thing, unless it’s me skiing, swimming, and maybe taking to tennis someday. 🤔

I value connections that build slowly, with trust, playfulness, and curiosity. I’ve learned to be kind to myself and others, and I’d love the same in kind, (pun intended). 🤗

I’m hoping to meet someone Dublin based, 26-36ish, who enjoys meaningful conversations, honesty and balances reflection with silliness. If that’s you, tell me what caught your eye, the connection you’re craving, or which shows you put on as background noise while adulting. 😁

Castor oil packs, Chinese herbs, teas, you name it I DID IT. I was desperate. 

I did 5 cycles and only ever made it to two retrievals. First retrieval one egg retrieved, it fertilized, and didn’t become a blast it just kept growing. 

Second retrieval again one egg retrieved despite four follicles, but this little fighter became a day 5 3AA blast. 

What did I do differently? Well I ate like shit, traveled, drank coffee like a barista 😭😭, barely took my supplements and said this is above me now. What’s for me is for me.

Seeing my one egg become such a high quality blast was a revelation for me that: 

1. Quality over Quantity matters is a fact.
2. Infertile women are so vulnerable and I hate that we are sold dreams by experts. Especially us DOR girlies.
3. JOY might be the best medicine we can give ourselves.

For context (because we all love it): 
I’m 27 year old, late diagnosed, high masking, high achieving wife and first time mom of a currently 14 month old baby. 
I have always had to accommodate myself. I have Tourette’s and my tics were debilitating in my teen years. I would “pass out” and tic for hours. I never had any energy but I still managed to be in AP classes and get a part time job. I grieved that I would never have teen energy and have gotten over that. My systems became work hard during the week- recover on the weekends. I continued this into college and grad school. This kept working for me in my first industry career job. Work - nap - work - recover at night. Sure I didn’t do out much a I spent a lot of free time sleeping or chilling but I was okay with that since I don’t like too much social interaction (once a month coffee date is good for me). Everything was working! I was coping and felt ready to start a family. However, the realization of how my system could destroyed by a baby never occurred to me. Whoops. 
Along comes baby and not only do NDs experience pregnancy differently but also post partum. Oh and on top of it we moved across the country when my baby was 5 weeks because my husband was accepted to a grad school. So about 3 months after the move I had debilitating anxiety and melt downs 3-5 times a day (I now know this is burn out). I went to a primary care and they added busbirone to my med list- oh and lowered my adhd meds too. I thought this helped some but I was still struggling. After the school year, this summer my husband had off and I felt finally better for a while. Well he’s going back to school next week and guess who is having melt downs. It’s me. 
So after over a year of being a parent it finally occurred to me that I was functioning using a system. I kept saying, well I could do this before how come not now. Well duh!!! My system was build in rest. But you know who never really truly gets to fully rest. Moms. Baby is at daycare when I work. Then he comes home. Weekends we spend together. All of this is wonderful. I don’t ever regret becoming a parent but—— I really wish I had someone (maybe a therapist, mine isn’t great at Autism stuff) who could have prepared me better. 

So I’m asking for advice on how to 
- deal with the constant “transitions” that exist because babies are always growing and changing ?
- how to build in more time to actually rest and sleep ?
- how to know what’s good enough for work? I can’t just half ass it. I have tried. And I’m lucky I have a remote and pretty flexible job but I have gotten use to work- crash- work- crash- weekend recover. Now it’s more like work- baby-pass out- work-baby- fucking tired on the weekend. 

I am all ears here. I’m even open to babysitters too! Even tho I will need to work around that guilt I can try and frame it like taking time to recharge to be the best mom while we have family time on weekends. I’ve even pondered taking Fridays off? Like I said I am alll ears!!!! (Say cheers- damn echolailia with Mickey Mouse)

The BELLA 35126-043A Single Serve Coffee Maker has quickly become my go-to for mornings when I'm racing against the clock. With its slim profile and understated Oatmilk finish, it easily blends into any kitchen's aesthetic without eating up valuable counter space. Measuring just 6.41"" by 12.51"" by 12"", it was an effortless fit even in my kitchenette. The chic matte exterior keeps it looking modern and clean with minimal effort.  

What sets this machine apart is its ability to cater to different coffee preferences. From standard ground coffee to the ever-convenient coffee pods, this brewer ensures everyone in the household is happy. On busy mornings, the one-touch operation is a saving grace—press, brew, and you’re good to go.  

**Ease of Use for Busy Mornings**  

I’m not a morning person—at all. With this coffee maker, brewing coffee is literally as easy as pressing a button. The coffee brews in just minutes, and the machine accommodates travel mugs up to 7 inches tall, making it ideal for days when I need to grab and go. My partner tends to prefer a smaller 6oz cup while I lean towards the 14oz maximum, and this brewer handles both sizes flawlessly without compromising brewing quality.  

[Find the best price for BELLA 35126-043A on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cyj6xt9s/)  

**Advantages**  

- The flexibility to brew with both coffee pods and ground coffee provides options for every taste.  
- Adjustable drip tray neatly fits a variety of travel and regular mugs, catering to your specific needs.  
- Compact and cord-friendly design keeps countertops feeling organized and clutter-free.  

**Performance & Brews**  

This single-serve machine isn’t just quick—it’s consistent. Whether I’m brewing a pod of vanilla hazelnut or using my favorite Kenyan ground coffee, the depth of flavor is satisfying. With its 1000-watt motor, the machine ensures that the water temperature is hot enough for optimal extraction, so the coffee never feels flat or watered down.  

The reusable filter inclusion is a thoughtful touch. I’ve used it to experiment with different grinds, and the results remained impressive across the board. On top of that, the auto shutoff feature gives peace of mind. I once dashed out the door halfway through brewing only to realize the machine shuts itself down once the job is done—a small detail, but such a lifesaver.  

**Critiques**  

- The water tank isn’t removable, which occasionally makes refilling a balancing act when you’re in a hurry.  
- While the drip tray is adjustable, setting it at the wrong height sometimes caused minor splatter onto the counter.  
- It doesn’t come with an insulated carafe option which some other single-serve coffee makers include for versatile brewing.  

**Easy Cleanup**  

What I probably underestimated about this model was the convenience of its dishwasher-safe parts. From the drip tray to the coffee pod adapter, cleanup has been as easy as tossing everything in the dishwasher. Even hand-washing the reusable filter has turned out to be quicker than I thought.  

Gone are those frustrating nights soaking filters forever just because coffee grounds found every crevice. Within five minutes, everything’s clean and ready to brew my next cup.  

**Product Contenders**  

When it comes to compact single-serve brewers, the BELLA model goes head-to-head with others like the Keurig K-Mini and the Mr. Coffee Single-Serve Coffee Brewer. Compared to the Keurig K-Mini, I found the BELLA slightly more affordable and just as versatile with its pod and ground coffee compatibility. The reusable filter option here becomes a great financial and eco-friendly perk, saving costs on pods over time. However, Keurig may slightly edge out in flavor consistency for pod users.  

Meanwhile, the Mr. Coffee alternative also features compact sizing but feels a step behind with fewer adjustable features. While the BELLA’s adjustable drip tray and quick cleanup features feel tailor-made for busy lifestyles, Mr. Coffee tends to lean more on rigid design, potentially ruling out larger mug compatibility.  

**Money’s Worth**  

For the price point, the level of versatility and convenience you’re getting feels well worth the investment. Budget-friendly machines often compromise on build quality or brewing options, but this one balances both admirably. If you're someone who loves having choices between pods and freshly ground coffee, this coffee maker won’t disappoint. It hits the sweet spot of being affordable without feeling ""cheap.""

A few people on the previous post kept saying I should consider switching my son to daycare since I wasn't getting the care I really wanted from my parents (who I paid!). It was very much on the table for my husband and I, though we didn't have a chance then to bring it up to my mom.

About 3-4 weeks after that post, my miserable job finally laid me off. It was a matter of time; I was already job hunting because I could feel it in the wind, but I was hoping to beat them to the punch. Alas, no luck. Ultimately it was a blessing because I could at least collect unemployment while job hunting and (most importantly!) finally having undivided time with my son.

I expected it to take forever to find another job but since I'd already been applying and interviewing since February, I was able to find something about 2 weeks into my unemploymen. I was supposed to start a new job on 8/18. It's fully on-site though, 35 minutes away, whereas before I'd been a remote worker. With my parents living 10 minutes away from me, I've been able to maintain reasonable 8 hour care days for them with my son, but now my work day will be like 11 hours with commute. It was kind of obvious that we couldn't continue this way.

I told my mom when I got the new job how long the hours were going to be and that my husband and I felt it was best to get preschool/daycare into the mix at this point. I said we wanted to find something close to both of us because we would need help with pickups and dropoffs and anyway, we still wanted her to be involved with his daily care. She was visibly sad at first but seemed to understand. Then hours after this conversation she called me, SOBBING so hard that I couldn't understand her, asking me ""why are you putting him in daycare? Did we do something wrong? Do you hate us? Do you want him separated from us? Please don't take him away, I love him so much."" She also started asking if she'd been a bad mother and why was I in therapy if not because I had a terrible childhood.

So I took a lot of time talking her off that ledge. It took the rest of that phone call plus a coffee date to assure her that this wasn't something we were doing TO her, it was something we were doing FOR her, my dad, and my son (and my husband and I. So yeah, everyone!). Eleven hours is a long day for two people in their early/mid 60s with a two-year-old. I also want to have backup for the days where they can't or don't want to be the primary caregivers. It was different when I was working remote; when she had an appointment or didn't feel well first thing in the morning, I could straddle work and parenting just enough that people at work didn't full catch on. 

I didn't mention that I wasn't always thrilled that I was paying for them to just hang out in their house all day (she won't even drive to our house to watch him, though for reasons you'll all understand soon, I'm sure my dad is big reason for that. I suspect he won't allow her). But yeah, I finally made a breakthrough with her and made her realize that even by choosing a place closer to our homes and not my or my husband's job, it should be proof to her that we wanted her involved with our son as much as possible. 

As I'm SURE many of you know/were expecting, very few places have openings this late in the game. I was able to find a place 3 minutes away from my parents (open 7:30-5:30) that was affordable and I was able to tour. I loved it immediately and my son was clearly enthralled. I talked to my mom and let her know that because of our work hours, we were going to need her or my dad to do drop-offs and pickups, at least for awhile since my husband is almost at the point where he can ask to rearrange his hours. She agreed wholeheartedly. I also mentioned that they couldn't take him until 8/25 so I'd need a week of care from her that we would still pay her for. She agreed to that as well, enthusiastically.

The next day (so two days ago as of this writing) I arrange a video call with both her and my dad just to nail down what end time they would prefer we contract at. At this point I think I'm involving my dad at the appropriate time and figuring my mom has briefed him on where we are in discussions, especially because she'd been saying, ""Daddy loves the mornings with E! He says he'll be up to watch him at 7 even if I'm not! He loves E just as much as I do!"" The call opens and it's just my dad in frame (I'd called my mom's phone). I can see my mom's elbow. So I nervously start talking about where we're at in the process, that I'm planning to sign paperwork with the school the next day but I want their feedback on the end time. At this point my dad butts in and says, ""This place opens when?"" I repeat 7:30. He said, ""But you'll be driving to work then."" I said yes, but Mom said we can drop our son off at your house and then one of you can get him to school. He said, ""I don't care what she says. You're telling me you, the parent, will never be able to drop your own kid off at his daycare?"" I said well no, but we picked this school because it was close to them and that's what mom  wanted (I can already hear her starting to sniffle off camera). And he said, ""Well you better find something else because that doesn't work.""

I really tried to stay calm. I said to him that this late in the game, very few places have availability. I said that two weeks ago, I was unemployed and was trying to survive that. I said I hadn't been planning this for weeks without his involvement, that I had just done weeks of work and due diligence in couple of days and was trying to make the best of a situation with very little time. He said he didn't care, that he was not going to do parenting for me and I needed to start over. I repeated that my new job started on Monday; I have no time to do the work I just put in. Again, he repeated that they would help me but as the parent, I need to be the one who gets him to his childcare.

At this point I started to lose it. I yelled, ""I don't understand the material difference between bringing my son to your house at 7am, him staying there for 11 hours, and picking him up after 6pm, versus bringing him to your house at 7am, you driving him 3 minutes away at 7:30, having him out of your hair for a MINIMUM of 9 hours, picking him up at your convenience, and me picking him up after 6pm. HOW IS THE SECOND OPTION WORSE?"" He asked me what my plan is if they are sick or away. ""My plan is to tell my job I will be around 20 minutes late because I need to take my son to childcare."" ""You should be planning for these contingencies for the start, not relying on us.""

It was truly getting out of hand. My mom was sobbing, still out of frame. Oh and did I mention my son was in the room, listening to all of this? 

My dad said, ""You should have been looking at daycares close to your job if you can't reliably get him to school."" I said if I did that, Mom would literally never see our son and she basically shrieked and broke into fresh sobs. I was then accused of making threats and I said, ""No I'm not threatening, I am stating the OBVIOUS. I wasted a whole week solving what I THOUGHT was the problem and now you are essentially telling me I CANNOT START MY NEW JOB because you don't like my plan."" He shouted, ""YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN. We will HELP you but you don't HAVE A PLAN.""

And that's when I said, ""But anytime I ask you for help, if you don't like the help that I'm asking for, you DENY it. No matter how dire my situation is. WHY DO YOU HATE ME? WHY DO YOU HATE ME SO FUCKING MUCH, DAD?! WHY DO YOU HATE ME? WHY DO YOU HATE ME?""

He rolled his eyes and folded his arms. My mom gets into the frame crying, ""HE DOESN'T HATE YOU, HE LOVES YOU, HE DID SO MUCH FOR YOU. PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT."" And I asked, ""Then why can he never show it? Why when I need help the most does he throw up roadblocks like this one?"" My dad says, ""I'm not creating roadblocks, I am negotiating."" I said, ""NEGOTIATING HOW? There's no negotiation here, Dad, it is August and very few schools have openings. You are extorting me. You are not Donald fucking Trump (Dad is a Fox News junkie who has voted for Trump all three times), there are no deals to be made here."" At that point he let the phone fall backwards onto the table so I was looking at the ceiling, and I hung up while I listened to my mom wail. 

It's a little late for a TL:DR I know, but to summarize the aftermath: my husband and I took yesterday to identify schools near our jobs. Most had no space; we found 2 that do but can't take our son till 9/2. I got my job to move my start date to 8/25 (did NOT want to do that, feels like a bad foot to start on, but didn't have much choice). Husband will take some PTO that week and I have a friend who offered to tag in. My MIL will also step in but she lives 3 hours away, so she'll need to stay over. I have talked to my mom a few times and she has cried hysterically each time, saying how much she loves me and my son and begging to see us again. I keep assuring her that she will see him again. I am not sure how that will work because I would rather step on a bed of rusty nails than keep my dad in my life.

1. Y’all thank you to those who respond with solutions instead of: “you can’t it’s natural, nothing is wrong with you, love yourself.” People post because they want to change and there is almost always a solution. If you appreciate your dark knees, I love that for you! I am understanding that people are trying to be encouraging but I wanted mine the way I want mine and past posters want to have a certain image. 

2. When you go to the dermatologist follow their suggestions to a “T.” If it doesn’t work the first cycle you then need to ask them “What are the rich people using?” “Treat me as if I don’t have a budget.” This is weird I know. They have medical expertise and are trying to help you, but some doctors hold out on certain products because of whatever bias- and safety of course. Ask them what is that product and if it is safe to use. If you have insurance the “higher price” option might not be that costly. They gave me a product that peeled my back acne in a week. 

3. Keep face routine simple. Like 3-4 products total. Some of the many bottles I see are either doing nothing, or redundant. 
Cleanser, moisturizer, topical ointment/serum. Sunscreen in the morning.

4. This one sounds hokey! I swear by it for my skin at least. A exfoliator for scars/ingrowns/ face when getting rid of dead pealed skin and bikini area: coconut oil, coffee grounds, a tiny amount of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice and a little fresh aloe leaf gel from my plant. I only use these in specified areas maybe 2x a week. 

5. I do not scrub my knees and elbows! I tried that since a kid. The dermatologist said that can make it worse due to a process called hyperpigmentation, where the skin produces more melanin, the pigment that determines skin color. This can be triggered by friction, inflammation, or sun exposure, and prolonged or excessive scrubbing can exacerbate the issue. They suggested Eucerin with the urea. But it didn’t work after 5 months. This sub suggested lactic acid! My dark knees have been drastically changed in 2 months. Like I am amazed, so thank you all for solutions! 

6. Lactic acid and not taking so many hot showers, just warm temperatures helped with my KP also. Lactic acid is good for my feet too. (Am lactin brand) 

7. Tretinoin is also a good cream and smooths wrinkles on my forehead and helped with ingrowns on my neck. 


Thank you all, I hope this helps someone out there.

1mrvbge,https://i.redd.it/ysi173nqvdjf1.png,Reconnecting with an Old Passion Is One of the Most Overlooked Leadership Tools for Mental Fitness and Long-Term Resilience,"**TL;DR:**
Many professionals unknowingly sacrifice personal passions in the name of productivity. But evidence shows that revisiting hobbies you once loved isn’t just restorative—it actively improves cognitive function, emotional regulation, and leadership effectiveness. This post explores why that matters, how it works neurologically, and practical ways to bring these passions back into your life.

---

As leaders, we tend to prioritize achievement, productivity, and impact. And understandably so—the demands of leadership are real. But in the process, many of us unintentionally abandon the activities that once gave us energy, joy, and a sense of personal fulfillment. Hobbies we loved—playing music, writing, painting, crafting, or even tinkering—slowly get edged out of our schedules by meetings, deadlines, and growing responsibilities.

What if I told you that reviving those past passions isn’t a nostalgic luxury, but an evidence-backed strategy for better leadership?

## Why This Matters

Reconnecting with a former hobby does more than improve mood—it supports leadership performance at a cognitive, emotional, and even neurological level. Here’s what the research tells us:

* **Mental Health Boosts:** Studies show that engaging in meaningful leisure activities is associated with lower levels of stress, depression, and anxiety. Revisiting a hobby you loved can create a surge of positive affect and a powerful sense of comfort through emotional familiarity. That ""flow state"" you enter while immersed in a passion reduces cortisol and helps reset the nervous system.

* **Cognitive Flexibility and Resilience:** Picking up an old hobby reactivates dormant neural pathways, while also creating new connections. This dual stimulation promotes cognitive agility—critical for complex decision-making and adaptive leadership. In fact, some studies have linked hobby re-engagement with slower cognitive decline, especially in older adults.

* **Self-Identity and Fulfillment:** Leadership often demands that we wear many hats, which can cause parts of our identity to fade. Reconnecting with a personal passion is a way of reclaiming agency and rediscovering who you are beyond your title or role. That sense of coherence and authenticity can directly strengthen your leadership presence and psychological resilience.

## Practical Ways to Reintegrate Forgotten Passions

One of the biggest barriers I see in coaching clients is the belief that they don’t have *time* for hobbies. But often, the issue isn’t time—it’s permission. The idea that engaging in something purely for personal joy is unproductive, or even selfish, runs deep in high-achieving cultures.

Here are a few practical, low-pressure ways to begin:

* **Start small, and remove expectations.** Don’t aim to become “good” at it again. Just give yourself permission to dabble—15 minutes with a sketchbook, a few pages of writing, a short walk with your camera.

* **Use habit stacking.** This technique from James Clear’s *Atomic Habits* can be powerful. Pair the hobby with an existing habit: ""After I make coffee on Sunday morning, I’ll play piano for 10 minutes.""

* **Adapt and simplify.** If your past hobby feels too demanding now, modify it. Used to play team sports? Try a solo version like racquetball. Loved long fiction writing? Try journaling or short-form pieces instead.

* **Revisit childhood interests.** Some of the most energizing hobbies come from early life experiences. The brain responds positively to the novelty and creativity associated with these memories, often sparking curiosity and playfulness.

* **Connect with others.** Whether it’s a local group, online forum, or friend with the same interest, shared passion creates accountability and motivation. Even posting about it (like you might do here) can help reignite your commitment.

## Final Thought

Leadership isn’t just about pushing harder or managing more effectively. It’s also about sustaining the person behind the role. Making space to reconnect with something you used to love—even if only occasionally—is one of the most underrated ways to strengthen your resilience and stay grounded.

If you're reading this on a weekend, consider this a signal to step away from your to-do list and invest a little time in something that brings *you* joy. Not for productivity. Not for growth. Just because it matters.

1mrv9cs,https://allexferr.substack.com/p/quiet-affection-a-love-letter-from,Quiet Affection: A Love Letter from me to Finland,"I never thought I’d grow attached to a country that measures connection in decibels of silence.

I’ve lived in many places — China, where mornings are thick with fried dough and bicycle grease; London, where damp stone holds centuries and buses sigh through narrow streets; Thailand, alive with lemongrass, petrol, and rain drumming on tin; Bali, heavy with salt on the skin and clove smoke curling from doorways. And in all of them, I learned there are no good or bad countries, only different kitchens — each with its own spice, its own bitterness, its own stubborn way of feeding your days. When you’re single, a place is a plate you can send back to the kitchen without much thought. With a child, it becomes the table where she learns to eat, talk, fight, and dream — her first tastes of the world served alongside mine.

Every smell, every accent, every shortcut home works its way into her story, and into mine.

Here I raise my half-Finn, half-brazuka (brazilian slang) daughter where safety isn’t a privilege bought by the metre. Where a stranger at the bus stop greets you with the same nod he’d give the mayor, and where silence isn’t awkward — it’s a shared language. I’ve stood at a train stop in -15°C, not a word spoken, just me and an old man watching the same crow peck at the snow — and somehow, that was enough. Where the corner shop cashier trusts me to walk out with bread and come back later with the coins. The habits here were strange at first — the sacred silence at bus stops, the final slice of cake left untouched as if it belonged to a saint, the way everyone steps aside to give each other space without thinking.

And yet, even in that calm, I sometimes feel the echo of another rhythm.

I still miss the noise of Brazil — stepping into a friend’s kitchen and getting kissed on both cheeks by three people before I could take my coat off, a handshake from an uncle I hadn’t seen in years, the quick volley of questions and jokes that fill the air before the coffee’s even poured.

That warmth, that constant overlap of voices, still tugs at me.

But slowly, I began to see the value in what others here may not notice: the snow that softens even the sound of your own thoughts, the way a shared kahvitauko and pulla in the park feels like a pact, the quiet sisu that keeps people walking through a snowstorm without complaint, the open forests and frozen lakes that belong to everyone under jokamiehen oikeudet. In the sauna, I saw the truest equality — no titles, no wealth to show, just steam, heat, and people stripped to the same skin.

It’s not the crackling rhythm of a street corner drum, nor the wet heat of a market at midday.

It’s the quiet assurance of things working without fanfare, the unspoken order that makes a stranger’s trust feel normal.

The comfort of knowing the postman no longer knocks, because he knows you’ll be there, right on time — like the buses that arrive exactly when the timetable says.

Maybe that’s the treasure here: not the noise that demands to be heard, but the small, ordinary acts that never have to ask — yet give you everything.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions about car desks can help potential buyers make informed decisions and select the most suitable option for their needs. Here are some frequently asked questions along with detailed answers:

**Are car desks safe to use while driving?**
Safety is paramount when using any accessory in a vehicle. Steering wheel-mounted desks should *never* be used while the vehicle is in motion.

**What types of vehicles are car desks compatible with?**
Most car desks are designed to be universally compatible with a wide range of vehicles, including cars, trucks, SUVs, and vans. However, it's essential to check the dimensions and adjustability features of a particular desk to ensure it fits comfortably and securely in your specific vehicle. Consider the size and shape of your seats, steering wheel, and dashboard when making your selection.

**How easy is it to install and remove a car desk?**
The installation and removal process varies depending on the type of car desk. Steering wheel-mounted desks are typically the easiest to install and remove, often requiring just a few seconds to attach and detach. Seat-mounted desks may require a bit more effort, involving straps or clamps that need to be adjusted. Look for models with user-friendly designs and clear instructions to simplify the installation process.

**what is the ideal weight capacity for a car desk?**

1mrv6bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1mrv6bd/does_tide_pods_3in1_detergent_deliver_powerful/,Does Tide PODS 3-in-1 Detergent Deliver Powerful Results? Honest Laundry Review,"Trying out the Tide PODS laundry detergent pacs, model number B0747YH7K9, was an interesting journey for someone like me, who does laundry daily for a busy household. With all the marketing buzz around it, I wanted to see if it could really deliver on its promise of being a 3-in-1 stain remover, odor fighter, and color protector. Let’s just say the experience has been mostly positive, but there are some areas to be aware of.

**Ease of Use**  
What struck me first about these detergent pods is how convenient they are. Gone are the days when I had to measure liquid detergent and deal with sticky spills. Each pac is pre-measured, reducing wastage and mess. Even my teenager, who usually shies away from helping with chores, found it as simple as tossing one pod into the washing machine drum. The instructions recommend adding it before putting the clothes in, and for larger or heavily soiled loads, using an extra pod. This simplicity alone feels like a game-changer in our household, and it’s definitely great for laundry newbies or those looking to save time.

**Check [Tide B0747YH7K9] price on Amazon.**  

**Cleaning Performance**  
When it came to cleaning, the product didn’t disappoint. It claims to provide “3x cleaning power,” and honestly, I saw that in action. From muddy soccer uniforms to everyday pillowcases and towels, it got the job done. The stain removal was impressive. Chocolate stains, coffee spills, and even grease from a kitchen apron came out without needing a separate stain remover. However, for truly stubborn stains like dried wine, a repeat wash or pre-treatment was still necessary. As someone who juggles a million tasks, the built-in stain fighters saved me considerable effort.

**Odor and Scent**  
The Spring Meadow scent is what I’d call a fresh floral-meadow vibe, but not overpowering. I loved how it added a subtle freshness to laundry without that artificial “chemical” smell you sometimes get with detergents. My clothes smelled clean for days, even when stored in a closet. On the flip side, if you are sensitive to fragrances, this might not be your cup of tea. For those who prefer unscented options, this isn't the product for you, which is one weak link in its versatility.

**Dissolves Perfectly**  
One of my initial concerns was whether these pods would dissolve completely, especially since I prefer cold water washes for energy savings. Thankfully, there were no issues. The special film on these pods ensures they dissolve quickly, leaving no sticky residue behind, even in a cold wash. Unlike my past experiences with other detergent pods, there was no clumping or undissolved goop lurking in the drum or sticking to clothes, which definitely made my life easier.

**Merits**  
- Convenient pre-measured pods eliminate wastage and mess.  
- Impressive stain removal, even for tough everyday stains.  
- Pleasant Spring Meadow scent leaves clothes smelling fresh for days.  
- Dissolves completely, even in energy-friendly cold water washes.  

**Critiques**  
- Not ideal for those with fragrance sensitivities due to its noticeable scent.  
- Struggles slightly with extreme stains, necessitating pre-treatment or extra effort.  

**Target User**  
Who would find Tide PODS most useful? Honestly, it’s anyone who values convenience and effectiveness. These are perfect for busy parents, college students, or even seniors looking for an easy laundry solution. It’s particularly handy for those managing large households where speed and efficiency in laundry are paramount. For campers or families doing quick washes on the go, the compact nature of the pods is a lifesaver as well.

**Product Comparisons**  
While Tide PODS excel in cleaning performance and ease of use, comparisons to rival brands like Gain Flings and Arm & Hammer detergent pods reveal slight nuances. Gain Flings offer similar pre-measured pods but have a more intense fragrance profile, which can be polarizing. Tide, in contrast, is more universally appealing, striking a balance with its scent. Arm & Hammer pods, on the other hand, are known for tackling extra heavy-duty loads but lack the same degree of color protection, making Tide PODS a better choice for preserving the vibrancy of garments. All three are priced in the same bracket, but the superior cleaning power and no-residue technology give the Tide product an edge, even if it means occasionally having to use an extra pod for stubborn stains.

**True Value**  
Given everything offered, there's undeniable value here. Tide PODS reduce the hassle of measuring detergent, pack in 3-in-1 cleaning agents, and deliver long-lasting fabric protection. Their convenience is unmatched, given they work efficiently across all temperatures and dissolve effortlessly, even in cold water. Are they the cheapest laundry solution out there? Probably not, but when it comes to reliability, odor-fighting power, and sheer convenience, they justify every penny. For my family, these pods strike an almost perfect price-to-quality balance, minimizing effort while ensuring excellent results.

## Key Features Analysis

The performance and effectiveness of a carbon water filter depend heavily on its design and functionality.

**activated Carbon Type:** The type of activated carbon used substantially impacts the filter’s performance. Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) is commonly used for its large surface area and effectiveness in removing chlorine, sediment, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Catalytic Activated Carbon exhibits enhanced capabilities in removing chloramine and hydrogen sulfide. Block Carbon filters offer higher density, resulting in superior contaminant removal and reduced channeling. The optimal choice depends on the specific contaminants present in your water supply.A high-quality activated carbon filter should specify the type of carbon used and its source. Certifications from organizations such as NSF International can validate the carbon's quality and effectiveness in removing specific contaminants. The specific type will depend on what you want to remove from the water.

**Filter Micron Rating:** The micron rating indicates the size of particles that the filter can effectively remove. A lower micron rating signifies finer filtration and the ability to capture smaller particles. For instance, a 5-micron filter will remove particles larger than 5 micrometers, including sediment, rust, and some protozoa. A 0.5-micron filter can remove even smaller particles, such as bacteria and cysts.

Selecting the appropriate micron rating involves balancing filtration effectiveness with water flow rate. Finer filtration can reduce water flow, so it’s essential to choose a filter that meets your water usage needs without compromising performance. It is essential to understand the water needs of the home and choose a flow rate accordingly.

**Filter Lifespan and Capacity:** The lifespan of a carbon water filter is measured in gallons or months, indicating how much water it can effectively filter before requiring replacement.Filter capacity can vary significantly, ranging from a few hundred gallons to several thousand. Factors such as the concentration of contaminants in the water and the frequency of use will influence the actual lifespan of the filter.

Choosing a filter with the appropriate capacity is crucial to ensure consistent water quality and avoid premature filter replacement.Consider your household's water consumption habits and the level of contamination in your water source when selecting a filter. Regularly replacing the filter as recommended by the manufacturer is essential for maintaining optimal performance and preventing the release of trapped contaminants back into the water supply.

**Flow Rate:** Flow rate, measured in gallons per minute (GPM), determines the speed at which water passes through the filter. higher flow rates are desirable for households needing a significant amount of filtered water quickly, such as for filling pitchers or running multiple appliances together. though, excessively high flow rates can reduce the contact time between the water and the carbon, perhaps diminishing the filter’s effectiveness.

Select a filter with a flow rate that aligns with your household's water usage patterns. Point-of-entry systems typically require higher flow rates than point-of-use filters. Ensure that the filter’s flow rate meets the demands of your appliances and fixtures without compromising water quality.

**Filter housing Material:** The material used for the filter housing can affect its durability and resistance to chemical leaching. Common materials include BPA-free plastics, stainless steel, and reinforced polymers. Stainless steel housings offer excellent durability and resistance to corrosion, making them suitable for demanding applications. BPA-free plastics provide a cost-effective choice while ensuring that harmful chemicals don't leach into the filtered water.

Choose a filter housing material that balances durability, chemical resistance, and cost.Ensure that the material is certified as safe for potable water applications. Regularly inspect the housing for signs of cracks or damage, and replace it as needed to maintain the integrity of the filtration system.

## Core benefits

Carbon water filters offer numerous benefits related to water quality and overall user experience.

**Improved Taste and Odor:** Carbon water filters excel at removing chlorine, chloramine, and other organic compounds that contribute to unpleasant tastes and odors in water. This results in water that is more palatable and enjoyable to drink, encouraging increased hydration. Many people find it easier to drink the recommended amount of water per day when the taste is fresher due to filtration.

The improved taste and odor also enhance the flavor of beverages and foods prepared with filtered water. Coffee,tea,and soups benefit from the absence of chlorine and other impurities,resulting in a more authentic and satisfying taste. Consistent filtering can yield positive results for more than just direct consumption.**Contaminant Removal:** carbon filters effectively remove a wide range of contaminants, including sediment, rust, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), pesticides, and herbicides. This helps reduce the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals and improves overall water safety. The level of contaminant removal can vary depending on the type of carbon used and the filter's micron rating.

By removing these contaminants, carbon water filters contribute to improved health and well-being. Reducing exposure to harmful substances can lower the risk of certain health problems associated with contaminated water. These include gastrointestinal issues, developmental problems, and certain types of cancer.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** While the initial investment in a carbon water filter may seem significant, it proves cost-effective in the long run compared to purchasing bottled water. The cost per gallon of filtered water is significantly lower than that of bottled water, resulting in substantial savings over time. Over time, the savings can add up to a considerable amount.

Moreover, using a carbon water filter reduces plastic waste associated with bottled water, contributing to environmental sustainability. This can appeal to those looking to reduce their environmental footprint. This reduces the number of plastic bottles ending up in landfills and oceans.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance:** Carbon water filters are generally easy to install and maintain. Many models feature simple installation processes and require minimal maintenance. Filter replacement is typically straightforward, with clear instructions provided by the manufacturer.Clear instructions are essential for ease of use.

Regular filter replacement is crucial for maintaining optimal performance. Most manufacturers recommend replacing filters every 6 to 12 months, depending on water quality and usage. Following the manufacturer's recommendations ensures that the filter continues to effectively remove contaminants and provide clean, safe water.

## FAQs Section

**How often should I replace my carbon water filter?**
The frequency of carbon water filter replacement depends largely on the filter type, the amount of water used, and the quality of the incoming water.Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations, but expect to replace a whole-house filter every 6-9 months, a fridge filter every 6 months, and a faucet filter every 3 months for optimal performance. For pitchers, the frequency is usually 1-2 months.

**Will a carbon filter remove fluoride from my water?**
While carbon filters are effective at removing chlorine, sediment, and organic compounds, they are not very effective at removing fluoride. Specialized filters like reverse osmosis, activated alumina, or specific fluoride filters excel at fluoride removal. The best type of filtration will often be found in reverse osmosis systems.

**Are carbon water filters effective against bacteria and viruses?**
Carbon filters alone typically do not remove bacteria and viruses. While they can remove larger particles that may carry microorganisms, they cannot filter out the microorganisms themselves. To effectively remove bacteria and viruses,combine carbon filtration with other methods like UV sterilization or use a filter specifically certified for microbial removal.

**What is the difference between activated carbon and catalytic carbon?**
Activated carbon is primarily used to remove chlorine, sediment, and VOCs. Catalytic carbon has been treated to enhance its ability to remove chloramine and hydrogen sulfide. catalytic carbon is also more effective at removing certain types of organic compounds. always choose the type of carbon best suited to the contaminants in the user's local water.

She said its extremely painful and doesn't hurt only if you are married to the person. OK, I grew up and realised it has nothing to do with being married but it remained in my head that sex is painful. Around the age of 17 I went to the gyneco for the first time and she said I also have a septate hymen. I had issued putting tampons inside, which further confirmed to me that having something inside me is complicated. I had my surgery to remove the septum at 22 years old. 

My doc told me that my hymen is actually very flexible and elastic so she didn't remove it entirely, just the septum. Since then I bought toys, average size and could put them inside. I was gentle but also a bit rougher but my hymen was still there.

I got on Tinder the previous days and matched with an airline pilot (30)  on layover. He was hot and was flirty with me but at the same time very nice. We met for a coffee, he said he is only on the app for hookups. I told him honestly that I am not ready for that one and admitted I am a virgin, which he found surprising as as I am 26 and probably no one would guess because I am not shy and actaylly wear revealing clothes and like flirting haha. 

So he didn't insist but 3 days later he texted me if I wanna go for an evening walk with him. I kinda knew he hopes for me but I was so attracted to him that I said ok, whatever. So I went out with him and went back to his hotel but couldn't do it. I got scared. He was annoyed but tried to hide it. I saw it clearly. Another few days passed and I apologised to him for wasting his time like that. He said no problem and suggested another date. This time we had sex.

It wasn't painful at all, but I was aroused. The thing is that my hymen still didn't break. It is there entirely. And he asked me why I didn't bleed and if I lied to him. I didn't and I know some women don't. We met again, had sex again and it was rougher this time and still nothing. Still there. He is average in size. Maybe even bigger than average but around that. 

Should I be worried? Will it even break? I had sex 3 times only (the second time we met we did it 2 times).  But for the first 40 to 40 seconds I guess, it didn't go in smoothly. No pain, just too tight. Its because of the hymen?

BTW, we are Europeans so virginity is not a big thing here. His reaction was a bit offensive, he accused me of lying. ",1,1755350215.0,whatdoIdo,8,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Stanford Cardinal vs. Hawaii Rainbow Warriors: A Tale of Two Coasts (and One Very Confused Tourist)**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your tiki mugs and silicon Valley coffee cups, because we’re about to dive into a clash of the titans: the Stanford Cardinal, that crisp, button-down crew from the Bay Area, vs. the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors, masters of aloha spirit and probably at least one conga line this season. Let’s parse the odds, digest the chaos, and predict who’ll come out on top.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie… Unless They’re on a Spreadsheet

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind the **Hawaii Rainbow Warriors** as the favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.75-1.77** (implied probability: \~56.5%). Stanford, meanwhile, is priced at **2.05-2.1** (\~47.6% implied), which is about the same chance as correctly guessing your Uber driver’s playlist.

The spread tells a tighter story: Hawaii is favored by **2.5 points**, with most books offering identical odds (1.91) on either side. That’s the sportsbook’s way of saying, “We’re not sure if this is a cakewalk or a nail-biter—just bet responsibly and don’t blame us when Stanford pulls a ‘Hawaiian roll’ on you.”

The total is locked at **52.5 points**, with even money on Over/Under. Given Hawaii’s likely explosive offense and Stanford’s defense (more on that in a second), this feels like the sportsbook’s version of a “I’ll have what she’s having” bet—safe, boring, and probably wrong.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Absurdity, and One Very Tripped Shoelace

Let’s start with **Stanford**. Their star quarterback, **Jack “The Tower” Thompson**, is out for this one after “injuring his pride” during a failed attempt to surf a rogue wave in Waikiki. Sources close to the team say he was “technically on vacation” and “definitely not Googling ‘how to paddleboard’ at 2 a.m.” His replacement? **Third-stringer Charlie “Why Not Me?” Nguyen**, who’s 2-for-2 in career touchdown passes—both to his own kicker. Not inspiring.

On the bright side, Stanford’s

With its focus on hydrolyzed collagen peptides and claims of enhancing collagen production, bone health, joint integrity, and skin elasticity, I knew I had to give it a try. Incorporating this into my daily routine felt like a small but meaningful investment in wellness, so I set out to see how well it actually performs. Spoiler alert: It delivers, but not without a few notable quirks.

**Packaging and Ease of Use**  
The first thing I noticed was how compact yet sturdy the container felt. Measuring 4.75 x 4.75 x 6.5 inches and weighing about 13.8 ounces, it fits perfectly in my pantry without taking up much space. The lid seals tightly, keeping the powder fresh even after multiple uses. As someone who’s fussy about convenience, I appreciated the pre-measured scoop included inside. While the container is practical, I did find myself wishing the scoop was easier to locate—it’s like it plays hide-and-seek in the powder every morning! Still, I’d rather deal with a buried scoop than lack one altogether.

**Mixability and Taste (or Lack Thereof)**  
One major selling point of this unflavored collagen powder is its versatility. I mixed it into smoothies, coffee, water, and even soups without any issues. Despite being unflavored, there’s a slight whisper of an aftertaste—nothing overpowering, but it’s there if you’re really paying close attention. If you’re someone with a sensitive palate, this might be mildly noticeable, but for me, it was easy to overlook in exchange for all the benefits.  

[Check Designs for Health SUVELAM price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b07g4kt75s/)  

**Positives**  
Throughout several weeks of consistent use, the product began to deliver results. Here are the standout aspects:  
- High bioavailability: Thanks to the hydrolyzed peptides with smaller molecular weights, my body seemed to absorb the collagen efficiently.  
- Patented quality: Knowing each collagen peptide is supported by clinical research gave me peace of mind.  
- Multi-purpose benefits: Over time, I noticed improvements in skin elasticity and joint comfort, especially after workouts.  
- Versatile usage: The powder integrates easily into various foods and drinks, even hot coffee.  

**Negatives**  
There were a handful of areas that could use fine-tuning:  
- The packaging design might irritate those constantly fishing around for the scoop.  
- For a collagen powder marketed as premium, it comes at a slightly higher cost compared to many alternatives in the market.  
- Minimal aftertaste, although mild, could bother certain users.  

**Absorption and Bioavailability**  
Performance is undeniably a strength. Unlike other collagen powders I’ve tried, this one features hydrolyzed collagen peptides that break down into smaller molecules for better absorption. It’s like my body knew exactly what to do with the nutrients—it’s efficient! The difference became most noticeable after three weeks when my post-exercise joint stiffness seemed to vanish. Whether climbing stairs or lifting weights at the gym, my knees felt less creaky, like they could carry me for miles.

**Competing Products**  
The collagen supplement market is filled with contenders, so naturally, I checked out what this product is up against. Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides, for example, is wildly popular and comes in at a slightly lower price point. However, Designs for Health edges out competitors in quality, particularly due to its bioactive hydrolyzed peptides. On the other hand, Orgain Collagen Peptides are comparable, especially in terms of versatility, though they seem to fall flat in clinical backing. If you’re after something extensively researched with patented ingredients, this one sets itself apart. If sheer affordability matters more, you could explore other brands.

**Price Performance**  
The phrase ""you get what you pay for"" sums up this collagen powder pretty accurately. While other options might spare your wallet, the premium elements—clinically backed peptides, superior absorption rates, and multi-functional benefits—justify its slightly higher expense. Let’s face it: some things are worth the splurge, and for me, this supplement qualifies as one of those investments in health and well-being.

## Key Features Analysis

The efficacy of a ceramic coating for car interiors hinges on several critical features that ensure long-lasting protection and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the surfaces treated.

**UV Resistance:** The harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun can wreak havoc on car interiors, causing fading, cracking, and discoloration of materials like leather, vinyl, and plastic. A high-quality ceramic coating should possess excellent UV resistance to prevent such damage over time. Look for coatings that specifically mention UV protection and have undergone testing to prove their effectiveness in blocking UV radiation.

The ability to withstand sun exposure is vital for maintaining the like-new appearance of your car's interior.

**Stain Resistance:** One of the primary benefits of ceramic coatings is their ability to repel stains from spills, dirt, and everyday messes. The coating creates a hydrophobic surface that prevents liquids and grime from penetrating the material, making it easier to clean up spills before they become permanent stains. The best coatings will resist staining from common culprits like coffee,soda,ink,and even greasy foods.This resistance to stains can save you time and effort while cleaning your vehicle.

**Abrasion Resistance:** Car interiors are subject to constant wear and tear from passengers entering and exiting the vehicle, friction from clothing against seats, and general use. A durable ceramic coating should offer good abrasion resistance to withstand these everyday stresses without scratching or wearing away easily. Look for coatings that are specifically formulated to provide a hard,protective layer that can stand up to regular use.

the coating's ability to protect against abrasion is crucial for preserving the integrity of seats and other interior surfaces.

**Hydrophobic Properties:** A ceramic coating's hydrophobic properties are essential for repelling water and other liquids, preventing them from soaking into the material and causing stains or damage. When liquids come into contact with a hydrophobic surface, they bead up and roll off easily, making cleanup a breeze. This also helps to prevent the growth of mold and mildew, which can thrive in damp environments.

Proper maintenance of hydrophobic properties is essential for keeping the inside of your car clean and dry.**ease of Request:** While professional application is always an option, many car owners prefer to apply ceramic coatings themselves. Thus, ease of application is a critical factor. The best coatings will come with clear instructions, easy-to-use applicators, and a forgiving formula that doesn't require extensive experience for successful application. Some coatings also offer a wipe-on,wipe-off application process,making it even simpler for DIY enthusiasts.The ease of application can save you the expense of hiring a professional installer.

**VOC Content:** Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are chemicals that can evaporate into the air and contribute to air pollution. When choosing a ceramic coating for your car's interior, its vital to consider the VOC content. Look for coatings that are low-VOC or VOC-free to minimize the impact on indoor air quality and protect your health.

Choosing coatings with low VOC content is also respectful of environmental concerns.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a ceramic coating for the interior of your vehicle provides several key benefits that contribute to its long-term preservation and value.

**Preserved Interior Appearance:** One of the most notable benefits of a ceramic coating is its ability to preserve the original appearance of your car's interior. by protecting against UV damage, stains, and abrasion, the coating helps to prevent fading, discoloration, and wear, keeping your seats, dashboard, and other surfaces looking newer for longer.

Imagine your car maintaining its showroom appeal for several years.

**Easier Cleaning and Maintenance:** Ceramic coatings make cleaning and maintaining your car's interior much easier. Becuase the coating creates a hydrophobic surface that repels liquids and grime, spills and messes can be easily wiped away with a damp cloth. This reduces the need for harsh chemicals or intensive cleaning methods, saving you time and effort while keeping your interior looking its best.

With less time spent cleaning, more time can be used traveling.

**Enhanced Resale Value:** Maintaining the appearance of your car's interior is crucial for preserving its resale value. A well-maintained interior demonstrates care and attention to detail, which can significantly increase your car's value when it comes time to sell or trade it in. Ceramic coatings can definitely help to preserve the like-new condition of your interior,making it more appealing to potential buyers and commanding a higher price.

A preserved interior translates to negotiating power when you sell.

A cleaner interior not only looks better but also reduces allergens and odors, improving the overall air quality inside your car.This is especially beneficial for individuals with allergies or sensitivities.

A hygienic environment lets you travel easier, no matter your health.

**Long-Term Cost savings:** While the initial cost of applying a ceramic coating may seem like an investment, it can actually save you money in the long run. By protecting your car's interior from damage, the coating can help to prevent costly repairs and replacements.It also reduces the frequency and intensity of cleaning, saving you money on cleaning products and professional detailing services.

Everybody knows that line from Atomic Habits. It truly stuck with me. Most people obsess over goals, but goals are just direction. The real driver of change is the systems you build and the habits you repeat daily. Over the past few years I built lots of new habits.

I go to the gym 5 times a week, eat healthy, speak and learn four languages, do full-time dev work and full-time university study, sleep 8 hours a night and still find time to socialize.

Here are some insights on how I managed to built these habits pretty effortlessly. Hope you enjoy :)

**Habits are compounding interest for your life.**  
Improve just 1% every day, and you’ll be 37x better in a year. Decline 1% each day, and you’ll almost disappear. The catch is that progress feels invisible in the beginning, but over time it compounds until the results look sudden.

These ideas have been gamechanging for me:

# Systems > Goals

Everyone wants the same outcomes: athletes want gold, founders want success, students want to pass. What separates them isn’t the goal, but rather it’s the system of daily habits they commit to.

# Identity > Outcomes

Most people start with outcomes:  
“I want to lose 10kg.”  
“I want to read more.”  
“I want to save money.”

But identity makes habits stick:  
“I’m the type of person who eats healthy.”  
“I’m a reader who picks up a book daily.”  
“I’m someone who invests automatically.”

When your habits tie to who you believe you are, they stop being chores and start being natural.

# The 4 Laws of Behavior Change (as James Clear defines them)

1. **Make it obvious (cue)** Environment beats willpower. Keep good cues visible, hide bad ones. Guitar in the living room = more practice. Floss next to toothbrush = more flossing. Junk food hidden away = less temptation. The stuff is so simple yet so overlooked imo.
2. **Make it attractive (craving)** Bundle habits with rewards. Netflix only on the elliptical. Coffee only during deep work.Podcasts only while walking or commuting
3. **Make it easy (response)** Shrink the habit to 2 minutes. Start tiny, let momentum carry you. Put on running shoes, step outside. Read one page. Write one sentence.
4. **Make it satisfying (reward)** We repeat what feels good. Create instant wins. Habit trackers and streaks. PRs in the gym or seeing recovery scores rise. Small milestones that reinforce progress

What looks like “overnight success” is really years of habits quietly compounding. The writer who “suddenly” landed a book deal had been showing up every week for years. The athlete who seems naturally gifted was stacking tiny improvements daily.

The world sees the result. What really matters is the system.

**Takeaway:**  
• Habits compound like interest  
• Systems matter more than goals  
• Identity outlasts outcomes  
• Make habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying

Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. Stack enough votes, and people will call you “lucky” or “disciplined.” But you’ll know the truth: it was just habits, compounded over time.

AMA Babes With Afterburners – Hyla Relay Edition 

Liara: Hey everyone, welcome back to Babes With Afterburners, your favorite orbital chaos AMA right here on Reddit! I’m Liara Lance, COO of Jade Industries, Vanguard ACE, and part time Lifeguard.

 RBB:  And I’m RetroBurnBabe, ARC pilot, AMSW’s #1 hazard-to-hull ratio, and the reason the Hyla system has three new traffic advisories.  We’re back and broadcasting live from somewhere between professionalism and pool party at Flamefete Port…

 Liara:  …to answer your questions and officially kick off the Hyla Relay Invitational!

 RBB:  It’s gonna be fast, it’s gonna be wild, and yes, there are rules. Just… very flexible ones.

 Liara: We’ve got drag burns, skimming runs, particle siphons, and enough gravitational chaos to make your nav AI cry.

 RBB: If you’ve ever shouted “I got this” before punching through atmosphere upside down, you’re gonna feel right at home.

 Liara: So buckle in, fire up your afterburners, and let’s get into the questions!

RBB:  Alright, let’s kick this off with some questions about the race.  This one comes from BoostMeDaddy (a name I will be emotionally unpacking later):  “Is the entire ARC team racing in the Hyla Relay?! Because if so, I’m betting on chaos.”

 Liara: Reasonable assumption.

 RBB:  Sadly, no. We drew straws. Chunks tampered with the straws. Long story short, I’m on beach duty.  NeonChunks is officially representing ARC in the Invitational.  Which is probably safer for everyone.  Except the other pilots.

Liara: And our next question is from Hednar\_and\_Shoulders: “I’ve got a ship and a dream.  If I’m not part of the main invite list, can I still fly in the event somehow?”

Liara:  The invitational is tight by design: a small group of invited racers for story and sanity reasons.  That said… There are exhibition brackets forming around the edges of the event.

 RBB:  Yup.  If you’ve got a ship that screams “bad idea,” ARC is watching.  Build it.  Name it something irresponsible.  Post it.  You might end up featured in Ship & Pilot or get a shoutout from me personally while I sip mango Terrabrew.

 Liara: If you have a team and a dream, show us what you’ve got. Build something bold.  The Invitational’s locked, but the orbit around it is wide open.  





RBB:  I’ve got a question here from grillCOLLector :  Liara, who is representing Jade in the relay?  I want to get ahead of the curve and snag their Pilot Trading Card before everyone else.

Liara: Fellow ACE pilot, Lila Hightower will be behind the controls for this event! I'll set aside a trading card just for you!

RBB: Dibs on the holo-foil edition!  And if she podiums, I’m demanding an autograph.  Smart move there grillCOLLector.  Once that telemetry hits the vids, her resale value’s gonna spike!

Liara:  She’s the kind of pilot that makes engineers feel like artists.  I couldn’t be prouder to have her out there.

RBB:  I just wish I had the chance to take her on!  Okay Liara, this one’s from Flowin\_Fizzy:  Any truth to the rumor that the Countach is so luxurious it has a hydroponic orchid garden and a velvet-lined torpedo bay?

RBB:  Look, let me cut in first and say I don’t know about velvet warheads, but if anyone’s gonna launch you into deep space wrapped in style, it’s Jade.  I toured the Countach and nearly forgot I was a racer.  Thought I was gonna get handed a flute of starberry fizz and a towel warmer.

Liara:  You would have spilled fizz on the nav console.  But yes, thank you.  The JI-LL-SPE-0621 Countach is not just a ship, it’s a statement of intent from Lancer Luxury.  It features full Stroud Premium integration, including a hydroponic garden that recirculates oxygen through Life Support.  And no velvet in the torpedo bay…but the concealed auto beams are wrapped in soft lighting.  Elegance meets deterrence.

RBB:  I heard it doesn’t hum, it sings in hard vac.  Marketing myth or actual acoustics?

Liara:  We don’t market noise.  We design presence.

RBB:  Exactly what I’d expect from Jade.  So what’s the Countach like at speed?  Quiet and clean or does it growl a little when you push it?

Liara:  She doesn’t growl.  She doesn’t need to.

RBB:  I’ve got a question here from TerraBoozed:  “Will Jade Industries be showcasing any new tech at the invitational, or is this all just a flex?”

Liara: The entire ship we are bringing features experimental tech. From engines to A/C.

RBB:  Meanwhile over at ARC, we’ve got RCS Dancer holding a capacitor with oven mitts yelling “It goes faster if it’s shiny!”  Different philosophies, same goal.



Liara:  Here’s one from Star\_Duck\_Incorporated: “Is the Hyla Relay just a speed trial, or are racers scored on more than who crosses the finish line first?”



Liara:  Great question.  The Hyla Relay isn’t just a drag sprint, it’s a multi-phase challenge.  We’re scoring based on speed, yes, but also particle siphon yield, course precision, and let’s be honest…style.



RBB:  It’s not just “first to finish”, it’s “Finish, look good doing it, and push every rule along the way right to the red-line.”  One racer in an early test run pulled a retroflip into the handoff buoy and we had to name the move.  Style matters.

Liara:  Next up from CargoHoldConfessional - that’s a little too relatable:  Retro, be honest, is the cracked helmet a safety risk or a brand statement?

RBB:  Yes!  And also: shut up, it still works.

Liara:  I’m trying to help her form proper contingencies.  For now, she has a spare helmet tucked next to her medkit.  It has a sticker that says “Plan B: Fashionable Panic”.

RBB:  Hey look, BurritoForgeIntern is back!  “Liara, are Jade ships actually tested in the field or just gently lowered onto satin pillows by interns?”

Liara:  Field tested.  By me when I have time.  I like to put any ship with my seal of approval on it through its paces.  Even better if I can do it in dramatic fashion.

RBB:  I saw her backflip a Pulsar GT through a lightning corridor once.  Didn’t spill a drop of Tranquilitea.  Like a terrifying ballet instructor.

Liara:  This one’s from Retro4eva: “What kind of vibe does ARC bring to an event like Hyla?”

RBB:  We bring the “no thoughts, just thrust” energy!  Expect wild buoy bounces, unsafe speeds, neon contrails, and at least one sand-skimmer labeled “Definitely Legal”.

Liara:  And don’t forget the post-race party where someone ends up sleeping on a heat exchanger.

RBB:  That was ONE TIME and I was hydrating.

Liara:  This one’s from DelGadoFanGirl:  What kind of security protocols are in place for the race?  Just curious!  For….scheduling reasons.

Liara:  Oh you know, standard measures.  Jade Security Forces are patrolling the inner system, we’ve got orbital traffic flagged, some automated defenses…

RBB:  …and ARC’s back up skimmers are on perimeter patrol!  Also Voidsnap said something about “contingencies”.  When he says that, I lock my cockpit from the inside.

Liara:  But, if you are planning to watch the race, tune in.  If you’re planning to interrupt it… maybe don’t.

RBB:  And now let’s take one from NovaMullet44:  If a ship explodes during the siphon phase but the flare trail is intact, does it still count as a complete run?

Liara: Not technically, no.  But you’ll absolutely get a sympathy shout out and possibly a JIR sticker.

RBB:  That happened to SkipTraceur last month!  The ship was gone, but the vapor trail spelled “YOLO.”  We gave him a patch and a hug.

RBB:  Oh this gem is from GalBankRepoSquad:  What’s the most creative excuse you’ve used to avoid paying docking fees?

Liara:  I don’t avoid them.  I prepay annually and receive thank-you notes from the port authority.

RBB:  I wrote “VOID DAMAGE - DO NOT BILL” on the hull with a sharpie.  They haven’t caught me yet, but that’s probably because NeonChunks scrubbed my telemetry ID.

Liara:  Here’s one from Used Galaxy: Retro, how does it feel to have Cadence Moor at the Relay?  And can you talk about AMSW’s new tribute vessel, the Spes Aeterna?

RBB:  Oh, Cadence?  Cadence is something else.  She’s like if a comet learned how to talk trash and fly tighter curves than anyone else in the system.  Having her here?  It’s like letting the big sister who always wins show up to your backyard barbeque, but you’re still proud because, let’s be honest, AMSW wouldn’t be AMSW without her story.  As for the Spes Aeterna.  Man, that’s not just a ship: that’s a handwritten letter from history.  FNA built dreams out of steel, and this was one of their last whispers.  We’re lucky it found us.  Lucky Cadence was the one to bring it home.

Liara:  I’ve had a first hand look at that ship, it is quite breathtaking.  The nanocoat shimmer, the clean asymmetry, the elegance.  It’s FNA craftsmanship at its finest, but with AMSW’s heart running through it now.

RBB:  The AMSW big wigs call it a tribute vessel.  I call it a reminder that what we build now?  It echoes.

Liara:  I’ve toured a lot of high end ships, but that one feels like stepping into something special.

RBB:  Exactly.  It’s not about speed, or wins, or even the Relay.  The Spes Aeterna says one thing: Keep going.

Liara:  This one comes from MechSuitMomma: If your cockpit suddenly depressurized and you could only save one thing, your helmet or your favorite snack, what would it be?

RBB:  Easy.  Helmet.  Because you can’t eat snacks if you’re dead.  But I would wedge a Burrito Forge churro into the helmet on my way out.  Survival and cinnamon.

Liara:  I’d save the helmet.  Jade helmets come with emergency nutrition gel built into the lining.  We’re even in negotiations with Chunks for a commercial roll out.  Patent pending.

RBB:  Here’s one from Jade\_and\_Tonic: Liara, when designing a racing ship, what comes first - thrust, balance, or aesthetics?

Liara:  Thrust and balance are interdependent.  But at Jade Industries, aesthetics are engineered.  The hull should move like a thought and look like a promise.  If it doesn’t make someone gasp before it burns, we didn’t build it right.

RBB:  Meanwhile over at ARC, we duct-tape engines to a brick and call it performance art.  Also, PhaseToast painted teeth on all her intake valves.  It scared an emotional support drone into self-deletion.

RBB:  Okay, this one’s got claws.  NemesisZeroChill wants to know: Who wins in a dogfight: ARC’s top racer or JIR’s most elegant design?

Liara:  Jade pilots don’t dogfight.  We glide, strike, and leave only contrails.  But if we must….I’ll take grace under pressure over chaos with a coffee addiction.

RBB.  Rude.  ARC flies like we’ve been wronged by the laws of physics and want revenge.  If it’s got wings, we’ll spin it.  If it doesn’t, we’ll weld some on and spin it anyway.

Liara:  I hope your warranty department is thriving.

RBB:  They are!  Emotionally unstable, but employed.

Liara:  This next one’s critical.  Void Born Vocaloid asks:  Favorite Chunks flavor?  Answer carefully.  This is going on my body mod.

RBB:  Oh EASY.  The new Spicy Cryo Nacho.  It burns twice and haunts your dreams.  10 out of 10, would regret again.

Liara:  I prefer Calibrated Citrus.  Light.  Balanced.  Slightly acidic.  Like me.

RBB:  Okay but what about Mystery Meat Cloud Deluxe?

Liara:  Absolutely not.

RBB:  You haven’t lived until you’ve eaten a floating protein cube and questioned your life choices in zero-G.

Liara:  Yeah, no thanks.  I’m good.



RBB:  Alright, this one’s from Sacred\_Hops69 - classy:  When is AMSW going to unveil a new flagship?  The Highwind’s been floating out there forever.  You guys hiding something or just afraid to update it?

RBB:  Wow.  Bold words for someone who’s never touched a ship that hums back at you.  Listen, the Highwind isn’t just a flagship: it’s the Founder’s masterpiece.  That hull was designed before most of ARC knew what a containment field was.  It’s not outdated.  It’s untouchable.  And between us?  There’s something about it that remembers things it shouldn’t.  It doesn’t just fly…it anticipates.

Liara:  I’ve flown near the Highwind.  It’s one of the smoothest gravity transitions I’ve ever logged.  No jank, no pull…just flow.  I also noticed the entire interior was developed in full collaboration with the Stroud-Eklund Premium Edition team.  Every joint, panel, and viewport is bespoke.  It’s less a ship and more a cathedral in motion.

RBB:  Exactly.  ARC wishes we could get our hands on that level of tech.  You don’t replace the Highwind.  You orbit it and take notes.

RBB:  Alright, this one’s wild!  We’ve got a live relay patch coming in from….. Oh stars!  That’s LILITH NINE on the line.

L9:  Retro.  Liara.  You’re beachside in the tropics while I’m broadcasting through radiation storms and gravitational guilt.  No invite?  No drop-in?  Not even a flare coded postcard?

Liara:  Lilith.  Always a pleasure.

RBB:  Girl I thought you liked ambient reactor noise and existential dread.

L9:  I do.  But I also like pineapple smoothies.  Prioritize your friends, ladies.  Anyway, two things before I cut out:  One, what’s your pre-race ritual and does it involve fire?  And two, if you could bring any one person from the past back for one last lap, who is it and what would you fly?

Liara:  Wow.  That went deep.  I’ll go first:  I test run everything the night before.  I mean everything.  Ship.  Comms.  Nav.  Even my boots.  No fire though…that’s more her thing…

RBB: ….guilty.  I light a Terrabrew cup on fire and toss it into the air like a signal to the stars.  As for the other question?  ….There’s someone.  An old AMSW pilot that never got their last run.  I’d fly the WYLD-1 with’em in the co-pilot seat and no destination logged.  Just vibes.

Liara:  I wonder who that might be.  As for me? I think I'd bring back Capt McMillian. The original pilot of the Super Void, better known now as 9 Lives. She wasn't famous, but in Alpha Centauri, her name still clears pirate bands from open channels.

RBB: That's the cat ship, right?

Liara: That's the cat ship. Black and white blur of doom. Crew of four, three humans and one furball named Lue. Pirates thought they had them cornered once. McMillian danced through that asteroid belt like it was a ballroom and left those raiders looking for new careers. It is said the ship survived because of luck. I think it was love. Precision. Courage. You know, pilot stuff.

RBB: You're getting poetic. Gonna cry into that black Jade cap?

Liara: No. But I am going to fly the Countach later and pretend I'm as smooth as she was. So yes, if I have one more lap? McMillian in the pilot seat. Me beside her. And Lue purring between us.

RBB: Alright. Well now I have to sneak into Jade hangars and take that cat for a lap, strictly for morale testing, obviously.

L9:  Respect.  Stay reckless and don’t burn up too early.  My signal is dropping, Lilith Nine signing off.

Liara:  Alright, we are going to start wrapping this up.  If we didn’t get to your question, it’s probably because Retro flagged it as a “vibes-based violation”.

RBB:  Or because I spilled Tranquilitea on the tablet again.  That’s on me.  Big thanks to everyone who tuned it, flared up, or just lurked with popcorn.

Liara:  The Hyla Relay Invitational is right around the corner.  We’ve got heat dives, orbital slingshots, atmospheric skims, and one too many ship builds named “Trust Me”.

RBB:  If you’re racing, good luck!  If you’re watching, hold on to something.  If you’re trying to hijack the feed again, nice try Nova.  We upgraded the firewall.

Liara:  From high-speed elegance to chaotic energy, every ship has a place in the story.  And we’re here to make sure that story ends in style.

RBB:  I’m RetroBurnBabe from ARC, professional cautionary tale…

Liara:  And I’m Liara Lance, Jade Industries’ PR-approved adult in the room.

 RBB:  Yup.  If you’ve got a ship that screams “bad idea,” ARC is watching.  Build it.  Name it something irresponsible.  Post it.  You might end up featured in Ship & Pilot or get a shoutout from me personally while I sip mango Terrabrew.

 Liara: If you have a team and a dream, show us what you’ve got. Build something bold.  The Invitational’s locked, but the orbit around it is wide open.  





RBB:  I’ve got a question here from grillCOLLector :  Liara, who is representing Jade in the relay?  I want to get ahead of the curve and snag their Pilot Trading Card before everyone else.

Liara: Fellow ACE pilot, Lila Hightower will be behind the controls for this event! I'll set aside a trading card just for you!

RBB: Dibs on the holo-foil edition!  And if she podiums, I’m demanding an autograph.  Smart move there grillCOLLector.  Once that telemetry hits the vids, her resale value’s gonna spike!

Liara:  She’s the kind of pilot that makes engineers feel like artists.  I couldn’t be prouder to have her out there.

RBB:  I just wish I had the chance to take her on!  Okay Liara, this one’s from Flowin\_Fizzy:  Any truth to the rumor that the Countach is so luxurious it has a hydroponic orchid garden and a velvet-lined torpedo bay?

RBB:  Look, let me cut in first and say I don’t know about velvet warheads, but if anyone’s gonna launch you into deep space wrapped in style, it’s Jade.  I toured the Countach and nearly forgot I was a racer.  Thought I was gonna get handed a flute of starberry fizz and a towel warmer.

Liara:  You would have spilled fizz on the nav console.  But yes, thank you.  The JI-LL-SPE-0621 Countach is not just a ship, it’s a statement of intent from Lancer Luxury.  It features full Stroud Premium integration, including a hydroponic garden that recirculates oxygen through Life Support.  And no velvet in the torpedo bay…but the concealed auto beams are wrapped in soft lighting.  Elegance meets deterrence.

RBB:  I heard it doesn’t hum, it sings in hard vac.  Marketing myth or actual acoustics?

Liara:  We don’t market noise.  We design presence.

RBB:  Exactly what I’d expect from Jade.  So what’s the Countach like at speed?  Quiet and clean or does it growl a little when you push it?

Liara:  She doesn’t growl.  She doesn’t need to.

RBB:  I’ve got a question here from TerraBoozed:  “Will Jade Industries be showcasing any new tech at the invitational, or is this all just a flex?”

Liara: The entire ship we are bringing features experimental tech. From engines to A/C.

RBB:  Meanwhile over at ARC, we’ve got RCS Dancer holding a capacitor with oven mitts yelling “It goes faster if it’s shiny!”  Different philosophies, same goal.



Liara:  Here’s one from Star\_Duck\_Incorporated: “Is the Hyla Relay just a speed trial, or are racers scored on more than who crosses the finish line first?”



Liara:  Great question.  The Hyla Relay isn’t just a drag sprint, it’s a multi-phase challenge.  We’re scoring based on speed, yes, but also particle siphon yield, course precision, and let’s be honest…style.



RBB:  It’s not just “first to finish”, it’s “Finish, look good doing it, and push every rule along the way right to the red-line.”  One racer in an early test run pulled a retroflip into the handoff buoy and we had to name the move.  Style matters.

Liara:  Next up from CargoHoldConfessional - that’s a little too relatable:  Retro, be honest, is the cracked helmet a safety risk or a brand statement?

RBB:  Yes!  And also: shut up, it still works.

Liara:  I’m trying to help her form proper contingencies.  For now, she has a spare helmet tucked next to her medkit.  It has a sticker that says “Plan B: Fashionable Panic”.

RBB:  Hey look, BurritoForgeIntern is back!  “Liara, are Jade ships actually tested in the field or just gently lowered onto satin pillows by interns?”

Liara:  Field tested.  By me when I have time.  I like to put any ship with my seal of approval on it through its paces.  Even better if I can do it in dramatic fashion.

RBB:  I saw her backflip a Pulsar GT through a lightning corridor once.  Didn’t spill a drop of Tranquilitea.  Like a terrifying ballet instructor.

Liara:  This one’s from Retro4eva: “What kind of vibe does ARC bring to an event like Hyla?”

RBB:  We bring the “no thoughts, just thrust” energy!  Expect wild buoy bounces, unsafe speeds, neon contrails, and at least one sand-skimmer labeled “Definitely Legal”.

Liara:  And don’t forget the post-race party where someone ends up sleeping on a heat exchanger.

RBB:  That was ONE TIME and I was hydrating.

Liara:  This one’s from DelGadoFanGirl:  What kind of security protocols are in place for the race?  Just curious!  For….scheduling reasons.

Liara:  Oh you know, standard measures.  Jade Security Forces are patrolling the inner system, we’ve got orbital traffic flagged, some automated defenses…

RBB:  …and ARC’s back up skimmers are on perimeter patrol!  Also Voidsnap said something about “contingencies”.  When he says that, I lock my cockpit from the inside.

Liara:  But, if you are planning to watch the race, tune in.  If you’re planning to interrupt it… maybe don’t.

RBB:  And now let’s take one from NovaMullet44:  If a ship explodes during the siphon phase but the flare trail is intact, does it still count as a complete run?

Liara: Not technically, no.  But you’ll absolutely get a sympathy shout out and possibly a JIR sticker.

RBB:  That happened to SkipTraceur last month!  The ship was gone, but the vapor trail spelled “YOLO.”  We gave him a patch and a hug.

RBB:  Oh this gem is from GalBankRepoSquad:  What’s the most creative excuse you’ve used to avoid paying docking fees?

Liara:  I don’t avoid them.  I prepay annually and receive thank-you notes from the port authority.

RBB:  I wrote “VOID DAMAGE - DO NOT BILL” on the hull with a sharpie.  They haven’t caught me yet, but that’s probably because NeonChunks scrubbed my telemetry ID.

Liara:  Here’s one from Used Galaxy: Retro, how does it feel to have Cadence Moor at the Relay?  And can you talk about AMSW’s new tribute vessel, the Spes Aeterna?

RBB:  Oh, Cadence?  Cadence is something else.  She’s like if a comet learned how to talk trash and fly tighter curves than anyone else in the system.  Having her here?  It’s like letting the big sister who always wins show up to your backyard barbeque, but you’re still proud because, let’s be honest, AMSW wouldn’t be AMSW without her story.  As for the Spes Aeterna.  Man, that’s not just a ship: that’s a handwritten letter from history.  FNA built dreams out of steel, and this was one of their last whispers.  We’re lucky it found us.  Lucky Cadence was the one to bring it home.

Liara:  I’ve had a first hand look at that ship, it is quite breathtaking.  The nanocoat shimmer, the clean asymmetry, the elegance.  It’s FNA craftsmanship at its finest, but with AMSW’s heart running through it now.

RBB:  The AMSW big wigs call it a tribute vessel.  I call it a reminder that what we build now?  It echoes.

Liara:  I’ve toured a lot of high end ships, but that one feels like stepping into something special.

RBB:  Exactly.  It’s not about speed, or wins, or even the Relay.  The Spes Aeterna says one thing: Keep going.

Liara:  This one comes from MechSuitMomma: If your cockpit suddenly depressurized and you could only save one thing, your helmet or your favorite snack, what would it be?

RBB:  Easy.  Helmet.  Because you can’t eat snacks if you’re dead.  But I would wedge a Burrito Forge churro into the helmet on my way out.  Survival and cinnamon.

Liara:  I’d save the helmet.  Jade helmets come with emergency nutrition gel built into the lining.  We’re even in negotiations with Chunks for a commercial roll out.  Patent pending.

RBB:  Here’s one from Jade\_and\_Tonic: Liara, when designing a racing ship, what comes first - thrust, balance, or aesthetics?

Liara:  Thrust and balance are interdependent.  But at Jade Industries, aesthetics are engineered.  The hull should move like a thought and look like a promise.  If it doesn’t make someone gasp before it burns, we didn’t build it right.

RBB:  Meanwhile over at ARC, we duct-tape engines to a brick and call it performance art.  Also, PhaseToast painted teeth on all her intake valves.  It scared an emotional support drone into self-deletion.

RBB:  Okay, this one’s got claws.  NemesisZeroChill wants to know: Who wins in a dogfight: ARC’s top racer or JIR’s most elegant design?

Liara:  Jade pilots don’t dogfight.  We glide, strike, and leave only contrails.  But if we must….I’ll take grace under pressure over chaos with a coffee addiction.

RBB.  Rude.  ARC flies like we’ve been wronged by the laws of physics and want revenge.  If it’s got wings, we’ll spin it.  If it doesn’t, we’ll weld some on and spin it anyway.

Liara:  I hope your warranty department is thriving.

RBB:  They are!  Emotionally unstable, but employed.

Liara:  This next one’s critical.  Void Born Vocaloid asks:  Favorite Chunks flavor?  Answer carefully.  This is going on my body mod.

RBB:  Oh EASY.  The new Spicy Cryo Nacho.  It burns twice and haunts your dreams.  10 out of 10, would regret again.

Liara:  I prefer Calibrated Citrus.  Light.  Balanced.  Slightly acidic.  Like me.

RBB:  Okay but what about Mystery Meat Cloud Deluxe?

Liara:  Absolutely not.

RBB:  You haven’t lived until you’ve eaten a floating protein cube and questioned your life choices in zero-G.

Liara:  Yeah, no thanks.  I’m good.



RBB:  Alright, this one’s from Sacred\_Hops69 - classy:  When is AMSW going to unveil a new flagship?  The Highwind’s been floating out there forever.  You guys hiding something or just afraid to update it?

RBB:  Wow.  Bold words for someone who’s never touched a ship that hums back at you.  Listen, the Highwind isn’t just a flagship: it’s the Founder’s masterpiece.  That hull was designed before most of ARC knew what a containment field was.  It’s not outdated.  It’s untouchable.  And between us?  There’s something about it that remembers things it shouldn’t.  It doesn’t just fly…it anticipates.

Liara:  I’ve flown near the Highwind.  It’s one of the smoothest gravity transitions I’ve ever logged.  No jank, no pull…just flow.  I also noticed the entire interior was developed in full collaboration with the Stroud-Eklund Premium Edition team.  Every joint, panel, and viewport is bespoke.  It’s less a ship and more a cathedral in motion.

RBB:  Exactly.  ARC wishes we could get our hands on that level of tech.  You don’t replace the Highwind.  You orbit it and take notes.

RBB:  Alright, this one’s wild!  We’ve got a live relay patch coming in from….. Oh stars!  That’s LILITH NINE on the line.

L9:  Retro.  Liara.  You’re beachside in the tropics while I’m broadcasting through radiation storms and gravitational guilt.  No invite?  No drop-in?  Not even a flare coded postcard?

Liara:  Lilith.  Always a pleasure.

RBB:  Girl I thought you liked ambient reactor noise and existential dread.

L9:  I do.  But I also like pineapple smoothies.  Prioritize your friends, ladies.  Anyway, two things before I cut out:  One, what’s your pre-race ritual and does it involve fire?  And two, if you could bring any one person from the past back for one last lap, who is it and what would you fly?

Liara:  Wow.  That went deep.  I’ll go first:  I test run everything the night before.  I mean everything.  Ship.  Comms.  Nav.  Even my boots.  No fire though…that’s more her thing…

RBB: ….guilty.  I light a Terrabrew cup on fire and toss it into the air like a signal to the stars.  As for the other question?  ….There’s someone.  An old AMSW pilot that never got their last run.  I’d fly the WYLD-1 with’em in the co-pilot seat and no destination logged.  Just vibes.

Liara:  I wonder who that might be.  As for me? I think I'd bring back Capt McMillian. The original pilot of the Super Void, better known now as 9 Lives. She wasn't famous, but in Alpha Centauri, her name still clears pirate bands from open channels.

RBB: That's the cat ship, right?

Liara: That's the cat ship. Black and white blur of doom. Crew of four, three humans and one furball named Lue. Pirates thought they had them cornered once. McMillian danced through that asteroid belt like it was a ballroom and left those raiders looking for new careers. It is said the ship survived because of luck. I think it was love. Precision. Courage. You know, pilot stuff.

RBB: You're getting poetic. Gonna cry into that black Jade cap?

Liara: No. But I am going to fly the Countach later and pretend I'm as smooth as she was. So yes, if I have one more lap? McMillian in the pilot seat. Me beside her. And Lue purring between us.

RBB: Alright. Well now I have to sneak into Jade hangars and take that cat for a lap, strictly for morale testing, obviously.

L9:  Respect.  Stay reckless and don’t burn up too early.  My signal is dropping, Lilith Nine signing off.

Liara:  Alright, we are going to start wrapping this up.  If we didn’t get to your question, it’s probably because Retro flagged it as a “vibes-based violation”.

RBB:  Or because I spilled Tranquilitea on the tablet again.  That’s on me.  Big thanks to everyone who tuned it, flared up, or just lurked with popcorn.

Liara:  The Hyla Relay Invitational is right around the corner.  We’ve got heat dives, orbital slingshots, atmospheric skims, and one too many ship builds named “Trust Me”.

RBB:  If you’re racing, good luck!  If you’re watching, hold on to something.  If you’re trying to hijack the feed again, nice try Nova.  We upgraded the firewall.

Liara:  From high-speed elegance to chaotic energy, every ship has a place in the story.  And we’re here to make sure that story ends in style.

RBB:  I’m RetroBurnBabe from ARC, professional cautionary tale…

Liara:  And I’m Liara Lance, Jade Industries’ PR-approved adult in the room.

1mrum4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1mrum4k/the_science_of_habits_how_i_built_systems_that/,The Science of Habits: How I Built Systems That Changed My Life,"“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”

Everybody knows that line from Atomic Habits. It truly stuck with me. Most people obsess over goals, but goals are just direction. The real driver of change is the systems you build and the habits you repeat daily. Over the past few years I built lots of new habits.

I go to the gym 5 times a week, eat healthy, speak and learn four languages, do full-time dev work and full-time university study, sleep 8 hours a night and still find time to socialize.

Here are some insights on how I managed to built these habits pretty effortlessly. Hope you enjoy :)

**Habits are compounding interest for your life.**  
Improve just 1% every day, and you’ll be 37x better in a year. Decline 1% each day, and you’ll almost disappear. The catch is that progress feels invisible in the beginning, but over time it compounds until the results look sudden.

These ideas have been gamechanging for me:

# Systems > Goals

Everyone wants the same outcomes: athletes want gold, founders want success, students want to pass. What separates them isn’t the goal, but rather it’s the system of daily habits they commit to.

# Identity > Outcomes

Most people start with outcomes:  
“I want to lose 10kg.”  
“I want to read more.”  
“I want to save money.”

But identity makes habits stick:  
“I’m the type of person who eats healthy.”  
“I’m a reader who picks up a book daily.”  
“I’m someone who invests automatically.”

When your habits tie to who you believe you are, they stop being chores and start being natural.

# The 4 Laws of Behavior Change (as James Clear defines them)

1. **Make it obvious (cue)** Environment beats willpower. Keep good cues visible, hide bad ones. Guitar in the living room = more practice. Floss next to toothbrush = more flossing. Junk food hidden away = less temptation. The stuff is so simple yet so overlooked imo.
2. **Make it attractive (craving)** Bundle habits with rewards. Netflix only on the elliptical. Coffee only during deep work.Podcasts only while walking or commuting
3. **Make it easy (response)** Shrink the habit to 2 minutes. Start tiny, let momentum carry you. Put on running shoes, step outside. Read one page. Write one sentence.
4. **Make it satisfying (reward)** We repeat what feels good. Create instant wins. Habit trackers and streaks. PRs in the gym or seeing recovery scores rise. Small milestones that reinforce progress

What looks like “overnight success” is really years of habits quietly compounding. The writer who “suddenly” landed a book deal had been showing up every week for years. The athlete who seems naturally gifted was stacking tiny improvements daily.

The world sees the result. What really matters is the system.

**Takeaway:**  
• Habits compound like interest  
• Systems matter more than goals  
• Identity outlasts outcomes  
• Make habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying

Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. Stack enough votes, and people will call you “lucky” or “disciplined.” But you’ll know the truth: it was just habits, compounded over time.

I wrote a [full breakdown here](https://www.outputtheory.com/p/the-science-of-habits-tiny-changes) with examples and ideas of my own life if you want to go deeper.

The painful thing is that I don't feel like I'm sluggish because my mind is moving quickly but every step takes me further away from achievement like an inner demon telling me to keep procrastinating and not start right away without realizing it.

And sometimes I realize the truth It's not just success that scares me but even failure as I think about higher expectations, or they increase the pressure on me procrastination remains a protective layer for us but a heavy layer that traps us preventing us from breathing.

Is it possible for anyone here to feel the same?  Does your procrastination seem like just a waste of time or an internal defense against fear? What  of  makes you rush to postpone tasks?",2,1755349082.0,getdisciplined,1,1.0,False

LOL.

Bernie rise up? Bernie take out the trash? Use you’re elite rolodex. Encourage the emergence of evidence regarding big money conspiracies holding us in digital prisons. Keeping the BILLIONAIRES in check has been a major talking point of your career, has it not? Those who would default to “communist” put downs to criticize the willful demands of prisoners in this unfair and illegal age of modern illusions are outdated and barbaric.

Is the Trump administration involved in wire tapping and data theft in our Windows computers, cell phones, smart devices, home security systems, etc…? Do you suppose it involves private sector contacts with foreign allegiance and/or globalist outlooks veering towards antidemocratic dystopia? On a related note, how might we decipher a Trump administration stocked with financial criminals, sex criminals and demented drug abusers - this being a reflection of Donald Trump’s personal style and livelihood? The despicable nature of this man’s White House, a rogues gallery of potential felons.

What a terrible theory to suggest Trump discussed incestuous or pedophilic interests with JD Vance or other members of his administration or inner circle (Mike Pence being a closeted homosexual, seeking more ideal affairs was let go). Do any Washington insiders consider JD Vance’s relationship with his sister mysterious? Was the Book of Job looming over this man’s childhood as a backdrop to familial abuse? Ron Howard, you could have no idea. As for Trump, we can only speculate about how many victims there are or where it began. Perhaps the Russians or other elite spy groups or agencies have sequestered knowledge on various matters, but who can say?...

Is it all too absurd the Washington establishment? As for the tech industry, the media, the entertainment industry? Why not a public facing movement of concerned scientists, tech workers, artists, media professionals, journalists (were they to have sufficient evidence of going problems, they might help decipher this for the public). Idiots of all stripes shit posting their ignorant theories should be ignored or shouted down. I can only speculate about the vast silence by Washington and the media. I sense the whisper campaigns and they’re being kept above the public. Some would defer to Illuminati style theories (one might say there are valid reflections, especially in this time of vast wealth and mysterious technical means) – but there are only so many public figures (and their shadowy puppeteers) involved in elite and abusive secret societies. There are many personal scandals one could consider, they may involve illegal behavior, or simply embarrassing or revealing private moments. Thoughts of kompromat loom over this era. That there have been elite data hit squads trying to gain knowledge of the public is undoubtedly true.

Their strategy to carefully use or defer from leaking valuable private data is hard to nail down. Major leaks about public figures could give up the game. That they hold the threat is the game. They’d just as soon use disinformation terrorism on us – pertaining to no facts at all. You can call them what they are: trillionaire freaks and their demented economic machinations.



I’ve found no material evidence of lies about me or my family, but my intuition has lead me to consider there are numerous laughable claims going on someplace beyond my sight. I have no sister. I’ve never been involved in the fashion industry. I’m not gay. I don’t have AIDS (I haven’t been to a doctor for 20 years, and I take no prescription drugs). I’m not a drunk, or a hard drug addict. Drug dealer, pimp, sex offender? Nope.



I have no recollections of familial abuse, other than my father’s violence against my mother, his sometimes rage and psychological terrorism. My mother was a borderline saint with clinical depression (perhaps too grounded in practical matters for “sainthood”, but who can say? She was often a Buddhist meditator). My father was both a selfish pauper and an egomaniac (to that extent some sort of original human being of his own making, I suppose). He never saved a dime (that’s not uncommon amongst those strapped for cash, they end up in debt not with elite interest rates). That he didn’t often seek government assistance, was perhaps his personal sense of pride – little to do with a lefty political leanings (many Republicans do seek welfare benefits unashamedly). If it’s really a point of speculation, he was homeless after Vietnam, and at other times. He used the GI bill to go to college, although he did not get a diploma. He worked as carpenter and tradesman in the 70’s into the 80s. He prospered (owned property) on the kindness of me and his sister later in life, as he was specifically left out of my grandfathers financial legacy due to long standing mutual animosity. My paternal grandfather John (Alfred) Peterson loaned my parents something like $3,000 in the 80s which they paid back with interest, as he had it. He refused to give my father a job. He was a bootstrapped millionaire who divorced his wife and abandoned his family to find his fortune in the fishing industry in the 50s. My father and his sister lived in foster care as children, their mother being unable to care for them.

As for my mother’s family, they weren’t heirs to Swiss bankers. Her grandparents immigrated from Russia during a time of cultural or ethnic (??) cleansing in the 1910s. Their region of origin is now Ukraine. Their native language was Yiddish, not Russian. Max Hershman, my mother’s maternal grandfather moved his family from Brooklyn to Canada when he was taken on as a symphony violinist, seemingly not accepted in New York. He was attempting to carry on his father’s legacy as a paid player. He eventually had to bow out of the symphony. They returned to Brooklyn where he took up honest jobs and struggled to make ends meet with eight children. He worked for years as a train conductor. I was told he enjoyed the public libraries. He was something of religious man, although he also enjoyed secular literature.

Sam Kaplan, who arrived in America alone as a teenager, was taken on and succeeded as a union film projectionist, becoming the leader of the union and founder of Kaplan Projectors. He attempted to expand his business to California where he was rejected. He was eventually tried for racketeering (some might say conflicts of interest, pointed to by maneuvers of rival business men). It’s too long ago for me to reflect in great depth about these matters, but I’ve looked in the archives of the New York Times where he was treated with bigoted view. That he carried a gun because there were threats to his life might be true. He spent some years in prison. The company was taken away and sold, becoming Century Projectors to some success.



His oldest son George was a keen academic, and went to a private high school where matters of faith and philosophy were debated, discussed or disregarded by youthful minds – Jews and gentiles alike. He was taken on at a Swiss university in the years before Pearl Harbor. He was not inducted into any satanic cults in Switzerland (that anything like that was available is merely a joke or odd consideration? One might say vague and eerie folklore). He was a straight lased student, but he only spent one year there with thoughts of a medical diploma. That the war was a going subject in that time amongst his peers, is certain. He decided to return to the US and ended up joining the Navy as the United States was drawn into the war (both my grandfathers served in the Navy). After serving in Europe, marrying Sarah Hershman, furthering his schooling in New York, he took on work as a stockbroker at Bache (eventually to become Prudential), where he worked his whole life. He avoided a life of crime, a straight arrow Reagan Republican with something like middle class values. He was not an executive at the company. To say he got top advice would be a fallacy. Some of his personal investments in companies like Chrysler came recommended by less honest men, presented as legitimate hot tips. My grandmother worked for the City of Hope raising money for charity. They retired to Florida.

Oddly, or disturbingly enough, they moved into a retirement community several miles away from Donald Trump’s then obscure real estate development Mar-a-lago. Perhaps due to the proximity of a local celebrity, my grandmother was slightly fascinated by his television appearances in that era, Regis and the like. I can’t imagine her voting for the man – she would have been disgusted by his turn as conservative super villain. As for my mother, she considered him a glitzy buffoon in that era (as did many). I recall owning a Trump Hotel and Casino coffee mug from the Taj Mahal in Vegas my grandmother bought at the gift shop . I drank out of that mug until it broke sometime in the late 90s. Good riddance. As for my grandmother: legendary in the family for her generosity (she did hook me up with some NES games, if that matters). She bought our family a computer. She insisted it should be IBM, based on hot tips at her retirement community. We got a Packard Bell IBM compatible as they called it. My grandfather who died in 1988 never learned to use a computer, and retired as his job became obsolete.

I hear you already saying in the comment section, recoiling at the thought of your precious liquid sustenance being removed from the mighty dais upon which it stands above all other edible substances. But hear me out, save your tomatoes you are going to throw at me for those cosmato wraps and read my simple 3 step plan to make other food worth it.

1. Introduce the heat mechanic to soups.

Currently this mechanic is only present on three kinds of food, ice cream, which turns into melted ice cream when heated. Unripe cheese, when turns into ripe cheese when heated. And coffee, which turns into cold coffee when left unheated. I believe introducing a similar mechanic to soup could make it outright less powerful without directly nerfing it's ability to sustain players.

So say, when a soup finishes cooking it is hot, if you take it off the stove or put some in your soup bowl the soup will eventually cool off (amplified by putting it in a refrigerator/freezer or a cooling/freezer slot in your backpack) a cold soup will still provide you with all the hunger and thirst fill it's hot counterpart would, but won't grant you the buff, as we all know soup buffs are tied directly to the warm fuzzy feeling you get from having a tummy full of hot soup. The soup itself still doesn't go bad making it an acceptable travel food to bring with you on those long excursions of looting your 400th lamp from the furniture store but if you neglect it too long it won't give you that extra little edge, right now every soup gives a buff (even if it is just the simple souper satisfied buff) which is one of the many reasons it's so much more appealing than other foods, and for those who really really want that buff you could return to base and put your soup into the warming drawer to heat it back up (or if you're a fancy backpack wearer, put your soup in the appropriate slot to keep it nice and warm). This also has the added benefit of giving the warming slot/warming drawer a purpose beyond making your cheese get cheesy faster. Alternatively you could leave your soup simmering on the stove at the cost of a small but constant power draw until you're ready to eat giving players the option to weigh their choices of freeing up a stove slot to cook more or keeping soup warm before you get access to other options.

""But Dr. V couldn't I just build more stoves and always have my soup stay warm?"" Yes, and I could build 10 pipe pistols and shoot them all without reloading like I'm Blackbeard on the high seas, this entire game is about circumventing problems by doing something off kilter and insane, but that doesn't mean it should be the -only- solution.

2. Get the oven sooner.

I understand that there is no point to a game if everything is handed to you on a silver platter but there isn't much fun to be had with a reward given to you so late that you've already written it out of your plans as useful. I think the oven blueprint should be earned at level 5, this still means you've got to work for it some but you'll earn it right before you hit the big XP fall off that makes those later levels a slog, and I'm also a firm believer that a blueprint should be gatekept by it's materials rather than player level, even if your Culinarian extreme team member grinds cooking to 5 before you've even managed get out of the first sector you'll still have to wait until you get to the actual zone where the resources needed to build it are at. Getting the option sooner also encourages more experimentation, soup is good for stretching out thin resources into something that can feed the whole team (or a single player for a long time) but as you get into the game you'll likely find yourself ignore food dropped from enemies or scavenged from containers simply because you've already got a surplus back at base, having more complex recipes that require more ingredients for singular results could help players feeling like the contents of their fridge doesn't exist to inevitably rot. This also brings me to the final point.

3. Share soup buffs with complex food.

A lot of the oven based foods don't give you any buffs despite the amount of ingredients required to make them, players love buffs, green circle good, so why not reward all that time and effort needed to make something more complex than soup also give a buff? You don't even need to create new buffs, why can't cookies give you Sweet Tooth? Why shouldn't creepy meat pie give you the Greyeb buff? Should a cheese toastie not give the toasty buff? It's in the name after all. Again it's all about giving players the freedom of choice, do they go for the bulk option of soup that can feed the whole team and buff them because resources are low? Or do they opt for the more filling but less numerous oven recipe that will still buff them, but fills them more and requires a bit more work to unlock in the first place?

I know this has probably all been thrown out there before and the Devs certainly have bigger fish to fry (yet not make into soup, curious), but with the introducing of the warming slots and the heating drawer and the fact that oven food is still largely neglected by most players for the landslide of benefits soup provides I still think food could do with a balance patch.",2,1755348891.0,AbioticFactor,2,0.67,False

Buckle up for a long one... First, B treated me like a princess, always complimented me, brought me coffees and drinks to work, cared for me when I was sick, and constantly did little things to help and let me know that I was thought of and cared for. He treated me better than I deserved much of the time, between my moodiness and ADHD, he was the calm to my chaos. 

We met in highschool and have known one another for 30+ years. We recently reconnected and it turned into a full fledged relationship before we knew it. He explained his living situation, his parents had sold him their home years prior but had recently moved back in to save more money for retirement. His Mom constantly hounded him about bills and was always moving stuff around throughout the house even in shared spaces. The place was a total wreck, lots of unfinished projects and less than tidy. In her eyes it was HER home, always had been, always would be. They were also very accepting of me and honestly, I love them both inspite of our ADHD not co-mingling well. I eventually moved in and we decided the house was large enough to turn into a duplex. We began getting what was needed to make a second kitchen and laundry room so the large home would be divided into a 1br/1 ba apartment and 3br/2ba house. His family is hyper religious which I'm respectful of but I am more spiritual, my beliefs and practices are much different but I didn't bring that aspect of my life there out of respect for them. As the months passed, I started to feel myself getting off center. I'm usually so solid and grounded but could tell I was losing the connection with myself and out of alignment. I wasn't hiking, meditating, taking time to clear my energies or my head and a great deal of my moodiness stemmed from that. I became stressed and depressed to the point I had an autoimmune flare up a couple of weeks ago that landed me in the bed for a couple of days. With his Mom harping about finances to him and stressing him out, I felt invisible or like my income was insignificant though I do well for myself through my profession and side hustle. I spent hundreds of not thousands of dollars on appliances, cabinets, fixtures, things for the house to turn it into a divided household comfortably. So I can't understand why my money isn't reliable enough to be counted on for bills. He owns his own business and I also helped him market that to gain more business but like I'm all business, some weeks were slower than others. 

That's the first part, this is the doozy. Before we reconnected, he had been arrested for porn (initially what was splashed all over social media and every news channel was cp, but through forensics it was determined this was not the case and he had no history on any of his electronic devices of such and the charges were lessened to 3 counts of possessing obscene material.) Just before we started talking, he had finally been sentenced (2 years later) and was ordered to serve weekends in jail for 60 days. He was upfront about this and bc I had known him for so long, I believed his version of what happened. I took him to jail on Fridays and picked him up on Sundays. This is not something you would ever believe of either of us as business professionals. Definitely not common but presented its own challenges. We couldn't go to common places-- parks, movies, libraries, certain events-- understandably as he's now a registered sex offender. He finished his 60 day sentence and for months I've told him as soon as his ""weekend job"" was complete we would go out of town to the casino. He had never been to one. The time finally came, I rushed home, having booked the hotel, and cashed in my free play ready to go and finally have fun for once. He came into the bathroom as I was getting out of the shower to tell me he could go anywhere in the state-- BUT THERE. I was so upset, it was far too late to cancel the hotel and make other plans. He offered to drop me off at the casino but I let him know the whole point was to be able to do something together for a change. Going into a casino would be a parole violation. That's when everything that had been piling up bubbled over. Between losing touch with myself slowly over time, watching him squabble with his Mom over our finances-- not hers-- ours, the home remodel not being completed bc he was waiting on whoever to do whatever, other recent issues, and now this last minute let down, I had lost all respect for him as a man. I feel that I often had to step up to get anything done and sure enough, if something needed to be done, instead of asking him, his family wanted to talk to me about it. It made me feel so masculine, especially when he was STANDING RIGHT THERE. It killed me, it's his house not mine. 

He is good to me and I love him more than anything but I had expressed to him multiple times over the past few months that I wasn't comfortable there in that situation. I told him I wanted to go home but he always talked me out of it bc he thought that by leaving THERE I was leaving HIM. I desperately needed to get to my peaceful place to get my head and heart right. I didn't do that and now it's over. I rarely get angry, rarely raise my voice but I yelled at him and immediately my heart broke. I told him we were done, that I couldn't live like this, that I didn't do anything wrong but was being punished like I had. I regret saying that in the tone I did, but not the worst. I told him we were done and just like with everything else he doesn't take action, just says ""Ok"" and walked off. I held my composure as I packed my belongings but the moment I pulled out of the driveway, I crumbled. I love him, he's my best friend, my confidant, the person who drives me absolutely mad but also the one who puts the biggest smile on my face. Right now, my heart aches and I'm absolutely sick. It's over. All the plans we had are just dumb daydreams now. The money and time I put into updating his home, his gain, my loss. And what makes me feel the worst is knowing I hurt him. I'm not sure there's anything else to say between us. I just know this hurts. Did I do the right thing by removing myself from the situation(s)? ",1,1755348645.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

But I am learning a new machine and have wanted to keep tinkering. I have heard ramping down pressure during the shot can have good results.

The result is fine but weaker and with a thinner crema than just staying at 6. I'm wondering if there is a better way to do this, such as changing how I dial in, or if this is just what those type of shots produce and so not the best option for these beans.

Hi, I’m Justin. 43. Based in South Florida. Never married, no kids. I’ve got a decent sense of humor, a strong taco opinion, and a soft spot for real conversations that don’t start with “so what do you do?”

Some quick stats:

🏒 Hockey fan (Panthers. Yes, I know we're just that awesome)

🌮 Loves both a 2am Taco Bell run and a well-plated multi-course meal

🚴‍♂️ Lycra bike guy. It’s dorky. It’s also fast.

💻 Works in tech but somehow still gets invited to social events

🌊 Beach time? Absolutely. New experiences? Always trying.


What I’m looking for is someone kind, curious, and open to building something real. You don’t have to be sunshine in human form, but I’m not trying to coach anyone out of their emotional cave either. Just show up with a few passions, a snack you’ll defend to the death, and a little willingness to let someone in.

I tend to connect best with people who’ve lived a little. The ones who know themselves, have had some wins and setbacks, and can laugh about both. If that’s you, age doesn’t matter. But if you’re still in your “what even is emotional intimacy?” phase, we probably won’t click.

Also, just being honest: I like to text. A lot. I know that’s a red flag to some, but it’s how I get to know someone - especially if we’re not meeting for coffee tomorrow. I’m not going to blow up your phone, but if you enjoy a steady back-and-forth, we’ll probably get along.
If your reply is just “lol,” I’ll assume you’re not ready for this level of banter.
And if your idea of connection is sending memes and disappearing, that’s fine but not what I’m here for.

I’m in Florida, but open to anywhere that makes sense. Long-distance is totally fine if there’s a path toward something real. It doesn’t have to be fast, but it should be moving in a direction.
I’m all for taking it slow, as long as we’re actually going somewhere.

And just to be upfront: I’m primarily attracted to women, but I’m open to connection in whatever form it takes if the energy is right and we’re both showing up. If something meaningful grows from that, great. If it’s a solid conversation or unexpected friendship, also great.

Not here for games or vague vibes. Just someone real - especially if “real” includes sarcasm, emotional intelligence, and at least one oddly specific comfort show.

Bonus question if you’re still here:
You just won the lottery. Not yacht-level rich, but “life just got a lot easier” rich. What’s the first thing you’d do just for you? No bills. No debt. Just joy.

**Introduction**

If you own a small business in Pune, you already understand — competition here isn't merely ""next door."" It's international. The store around the corner is no longer your biggest competitor; you're competing against Instagram vendors in Mumbai, Facebook shops in Delhi, and even e-commerce giants bringing products to your customer's doorstep.

That's why digital marketing isn't a ""nice-to-have"" anymore; it's do-or-die. But here's the good news: you don't always have to have an enormous budget or a giant corporate marketing department to make it happen. With the right hacks and strategies, small business owners can compete on the same turf as the big boys — and come out victorious.

I've collaborated with numerous entrepreneurs here, and among the most productive ideas weren't bookish concepts from fancy textbooks — they were born out of chai-table discussions, failed experiments, and hard-earned lessons. Whether you do it yourself or hire a[ digital marketing agency in Pune](https://digitizebrand.com/), these hacks will make your presence stand out like a sore thumb.

**Hack #1 – Begin with a Clear Goal (Not Just ""More Sales"")**

When I probe entrepreneurs of small businesses for their marketing objectives, the typical response I receive is: ""We just want more customers."" But that is as useful as saying to a chef, ""Just make food."" It is too vague to do anything with.

Before spending a single rupee, determine if you wish to:

* Grow brand awareness locally
* Get more traffic to your shop
* Sell more on your website
* Build a loyal community

For instance, a bakery in Kothrud which I had consulted once wasn't generating much from ads since they were showing ads to ""people in Pune"" — that's almost 7 million individuals! Once they were targeting ""people within 3 km who bought cakes online last month,"" sales doubled without spending more on ads.



**Hack #2 – Make Local SEO Your Best Friend**



If you've ever typed ""best dosa near me"" and wound up at a small restaurant you'd never heard of, you've felt the wonder of Local SEO.

Here's what you can begin doing from today:

* Claim and maximize your Google Business Profile. Include photos, products, and customer reviews.
* Include place-based terms such as ""Pune"" or your locality in your website titles and descriptions.
* Create content around local events or news that connects to your business.

My client owns a fitness studio in Baner and began writing blogs on ""Best Running Spots in Pune"" and ""Healthy Breakfast Options Near Baner"". Within a span of three months, they were receiving leads from individuals who had never even searched for ""gym"" but found their website through these articles.



**Hack #3 – The 80/20 Social Media Rule**

Imagine your social media as a dinner party. If you speak only of yourself, guests will depart. The 80/20 rule dictates:

* 80% of your content must be worthwhile, entertaining, or informative.
* 20% promotional.

For instance, if you have an organic skin-care business, don't share ""Buy Now"" links all day. Share tips about skin care for Pune's climate, share customer tales, and have ""behind-the-scenes"" videos.

It's not about selling daily — it's about keeping yourself in your customer's mind so when they do need what you've got, you're the first name they consider.



**Hack #4 – Use Email Like It's 2005 (Because It Still Works)**

Everyone loves to proclaim email marketing dead. Humorously enough, it's more alive than ever — particularly for small businesses.

The secret to success is customization. A one-off email to 300 loyal customers will beat a blanket blast to 3,000 strangers.

One Pune-based bookstore that I've worked with sends a ""Sunday Morning Reads"" email each week — not with special offers, but with curated book suggestions. And the result? Their email open rate is more than 40%, and customers actually request to join the list.  
  


**Hack #5 – Performance Marketing Without Busting Your Budget**



Performance marketing — ads you only pay for when people click, sign up, or buy — can transform your business. But it's also the quickest route to burning your budget if you're not watchful.

If you have a performance marketing agency in Pune, ensure that they:

* Test several ad creatives before scaling.
* Use retargeting to regain visitors who didn't convert.
* Set rigid day budgets while testing.

I once witnessed a local coffee shop lose ₹20,000 in a week because their ad was reaching the entire state of Maharashtra. Focusing on ""students and working professionals within 5 km"" doubled their ROI.



**Hack #6 – Use Storytelling for Trust & Conversions**

Human beings don't buy products — they buy stories. The more personal, the better.

One of the clients, a handcrafted furniture shop in Pimpri, did not simply post product images. They explained how their wood was sourced from reused old houses in Maharashtra. Sales not only increased, but reporters covered the story, providing them with free publicity and backlinks.  
  


**Hack #7 – Repurpose Content Like a Pro**

If you’re creating one piece of content at a time, you’re working too hard. Turn a blog into an Instagram carousel, a YouTube video, and an email newsletter.

I know a small café in FC Road that films short clips while making their weekly special, posts them on Instagram Reels, writes a blog about it, and sends the recipe in an email. One effort — four pieces of content.



**Conclusion**

1mru6jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/married/comments/1mru6jn/free_date_night_planner_and_questions_app_for/,Free date night planner and questions app for couples,"Hi all (this post is mod approved🎉)!

My wife and I have been married for going on 8 years now and we've had our fair share of struggles, particularly as it came with managing time and continuing to prioritize our relationship. Work, kids, stress...it just seemed to always creep and take the reins.

Date nights were first to go, then our conversations started sounding more like meetings, and we were well on our way down the road to roommates-ville.

I wasn't at all surprised to see that the National Marriage Project said that couples who go on frequent date nights are 14 percentage points less likely to get divorced.

In response, we actually compiled all of our date night ideas together into a free app where you answer a few questions like whether you want to stay in or go out, if you want to do something relaxing or active, etc. and then it shows you some date idea options. So far we added over 500 ideas and each date idea has step by step instructions, supplies lists, guides, recipes, and even playlists.

If you want it, it's free (actually free, not free with a premium tier or anything like that).

Here's the link to check it out!

[https://lovetrackapp.com](https://lovetrackapp.com)

We've also partnered up with a lot of great organizations like the National Alliance for Relationship & Marriage Education, the Together Program at the University of Maryland, the Utah Marriage Commission at Utah State University, Blue Star Families (for military and Veteran families), and several others to add more features and resources to support healthy marriages.

Here's a list of the features on the app.

* **An Interactive Date Night Planner** \- 500+ fully planned date night ideas with everything you need to make them happen, and we also have a partnership with Ticketmaster to show you date night events in your area.
* **5,000+ Daily Couples Questions** \- We give you three unique couples questions everyday to share with your partner. Some are fun, some are quirky, and some are deep. We're also rolling out our ""questions packs"" (all free, always free) later this month and the ability to answer in app. 
* **Anniversary and Birthday Reminders** \- Reminders of important dates so you never forget and tips to celebrate.
* **Relationship Counter** \- See exactly how long you've been together and how long you've been married without having to always do the math.
* **Things to Remember** \- Track 80+ important things about your partner like their go-to coffee order, their favorite song, foods they like and dislike, what clothing sizes they wear, etc.
* **Milestone Tracker** \- Remember 50+ important memories, when they happened, and the details that matter like first kiss, first trip, first DIY project, etc.
* **Random Acts of Romance** \- Quick ideas that take less than 5 minutes and minimal effort, but are super romantic you can do for your partner.
* **Daily Relationship Tips** \- Everyday we have a short 2-3 minute article + reflection questions on a wide range of topics to help you with your relationship.

Again, this is free and will always be free. We just got back from a healthy relationship summit in Washington D.C. and we have some really neat stuff we're getting added soon!

If there is ANYTHING you like or would like to see improved, please let us know and we'll work to make it happen for you. 

Just a note, it's US only right now, but we'll be rolling it out to other countries very soon, so if you're not US and are interested, feel free to comment your country so we can prioritize it.

""Dr. Gallagher, do I have a soul?""
""I've never been a religious person.""
""People often use heart and soul interchangeably, but I don't have a heart.""
I stopped typing my report to look at him. Alan was almost a normal boy. Except for the part where he lacks a heart. Not in a poetic sense. Literally, he has no heart. That's the reason he's here in this God forsaken wasteland.
""Ard you alright Alan? Do you want to talk dr. Young?"" I asked him.
Alan said nothing, just looked sullen. His eyes said more than he could have. Fourteen year olds are not know for being good with their feelings, let alone putting them into words.

I had been at the facility for five years. For some reason Alan gravitated to me. He was technically the youngest resident we currently have. He was only two days old when we took him. It was easy enough to fake a case of SIDs, take him and leave an empty shell behind. Alan was too valuable as an object of research to live a normal life. His mother had been a child herself, she was only sixteen. I hope she wasn't too emotionally damaged by her son's ""death."" Maybe that's why he gravitated to me. I would be the same age as his mother. 
""The presence of a soul cannot be proven or disproven by any means, the same way God can't."" I told him. He kept staring at the ground. I suppose it wouldn't kill me to soften my words. ""Whether you have a soul or not you are a living being with thoughts and feelings. And I'll have you know you're a much better person than some people I've met. If you do have a soul it's a very gentle one.""

I couldn't tell if my words got through to him. Despite my doctorial degrees, I'm a complete moron when it comes to interpersonal relations.

""Hey, Alan. Shouldn't you be with your tutor?"" I looked over and saw Joey, a colleague of mine. If he didn't wear a lab coat you would probably think he was a vagrant, even if they were almost impossible in this corner of the world. He even covered his name tag with a ""Hi! My name is: Joey"" sticker. To be fair, I'd cover it up if I had his name.

Alan again said nothing. He quietly got up and left my office. When Alan was out of earshot I told Joey what he had been asking.

""Ah... I get it. Souls are a tricky subject. Especially around here."" He said, then shrugged. ""But thinking about those things gets you nowhere. Its not necessary. You can't do anything about it."" ""You're talking like an engineer."" I told him. I wish he would be a little more serious at times, but I suppose his disposition is how he's managed to avoid going insane.

""Join me for a smoke?""

I stood up and followed him out of my office. Soft music played in the hallways. When dealing with human anomalies you want to create a calm environment. The music didn't drown out the sound of our shoes on the sterile tile. Sterile tile that is also bullet, blast, and flame proof. 

We arrived at the elevator. I hit the button for the fourth floor. The entire time Joey told me about how his research was going and what happened in the shows he had been watching. He also made it into the top 100 racers in the facilities Mario Kart leader board.

The elevator opened to the café. If you didn't know any better you would think you were teleported to a packed Starbucks. That is, if teleportation technology didn't turn you inside out. Currently the guys on floor two have been trying to throw shells through the entrance and having them mostly intact at the exit. The head of housekeeping yelled at them a bit, now they put down plastic. It's a much easier clean up. 

Joey led me to a table next to a glass wall. We sit down. I stare out the glass at blindingly white desert. Snow as far as the eye can see and a bright blue sky. I smell Joey's cigarette, he likes the citrus ones. Healthy cigarettes are abundant here, but they're easier to produce for a small amount of people than the general public. Not to mention all tobacco companies that would lobby against us. Big business never like threats.

""I'm gonna get us some coffee."" Joey said as he stood up and left. He already knows what to order for me. Sometimes the vastness of Antarctica still gets to me. The temperature must be -70 right now. Anything would freeze solid fast... well, almost anything.

I see a figure in the distance. Human in shape. I doubt it's one of ours. We don't have any residents with extreme body temperature abilities right now and a researcher would be wearing clothes.

""Hey, what is that?"" I hear from another table. ""Is that one of them?"" People gather around the wall. We call them ice zombies. None of that walker or shambler name crap you see in movies and TV shows.

The figure's head explodes, leading to noise from the crowd like their team just scored a touchdown. 

Sniper got them.

A retriever will be sent to gather the remains. I don't know why, we never get anywhere with them. I just know I'm going to do the autopsy. Like I don't have anything better to do. That's exactly what she would do.

Everyone had gone back to their seats. Back to life as normal as if a mysterious life form didn't just get domed right in front of us. I'd be an idiot to get on a soap box about it. These things pop up every so often, and every time they get taken out by the automatic defense system. We'd be screwed if we ever had a Maximum Overdrive situation. 

Joey puts a cup in front of me. ""Caffè mocha, just the way you like it."" I take a sip. ""Another one of those things?"" He asks, looking out the window.

I heard someone heaving. I look over and see a young woman puking into a trash can. She must be new. Probably fresh from some big name university with a shady secret society. That's typically where whoever operates this place finds new recruits. Horrible bangs.

As it says in the employee handbook, I don't need to know. The ones that can't help it and dig deeper don't stick around long. The handbook says I also don't need to know what happens to them. Probably just a memory wipe, putting them somewhere like Alantic City with a bunch of empty booze bottles, and some fresh false memories.

Otherwise... well... nothing goes to waste here.

""So Alan is wondering about souls huh?"" Joey asks.
""It's not surprising. He's been reading books on religion and philosophy since he found out the significance of his condition."" I say.

""What is the status on his research anyway?""

""We believe he has self propelling blood. It could really help people if we could figure out just what it is that makes his cells so abnormal. From all angles they seem to have the same structure as any others.""

Joey has a moment of thought.

""You know, his birthday is coming up next month. You think he would like some MCR CDs?""

""I suppose he is at the best age to listen to them, but is feeding into his emo phase good for him?""

""C'mon, it's not like he's going to be a kid forever. Besides, it's not like he'll ever experience life outside of here. Let him enjoy himself.""

I hated being reminded of that. Alan should be trying out for teams and getting in trouble with friends. At least from what I hear teenagehood is like. I mostly just studied. Probably the reason why I can't read people well. Or the autism. Could be both.

Joey went on about something. I wasn't really paying attention in all honesty. I was sipping my coffee and watching the clean up outside. A retriever had gone out. They looked like a mix of a skid loader and the mar rover. It drove out and scooped up the body, along with any bloody snow. It then deployed it's cover to protect the specimen from any more contamination. 

I remember someone from engineering say that one of those was about the same price as the state of Wyoming. Wyoming is the least populated state, but still, not an amount to sneeze at.

""You can't get rid of your soul you know.""

That brings me back to the one sided conversation. I look at Joey. I know he's going to give me a soft earful.

""You've been sneaking your blood in with our emergency supply again. Haven't you?"" He asks, already knowing the truth.

""I'm a universal donor. Logically I should donate more.""

""I know that's the reason you tell yourself but the amount you give is self destructive. Your going to wake up with us pumping your blood back into you again. I don't want to make that call."" 

Why did Joey have to be on friendly terms with my parents?

""I haven't been a child in two decades, so don't treat me like one.""

""I'm just a concerned friend, Opal.""

""Doctor Opal Gallagher to the administrator's office, Doctor Opal Gallagher to the administrator's office.""

I was more than happy to leave Joey at the table when hearing the PA announcement. I went into the elevator and hit the button to sub floor 2 where my office was. I might have wanted to get away from the situation with Joey, but there was no way I was going to the administrator's office. Agate could figure her own problems out. She never summoned me for anything worth the trip there.

The elevator stopped and opened. I continued to my destination.

""I know I have some weird thing going on with me but I have to get back to Cincinnati!""

Oh lord, must be a new resident. I turned the corner and saw a man arguing with a CNA. Best too walk by and ignore.

""Excuse me, ma'am!""

Shit he saw me.

""My name is Richard Hamilton and I need to get out of here."" The man apparently named Richard said.

""Nice to meet you mr. Hamilton, I'm Dr. Gallagher, I'm a doctor here at the Bryd Research Facility."" I said wearing the face of my more pleasant sister. 

""Well, I've just about had enough of you people. I try to get some information but you guys just keep talking in circles! What is this place? What about my wife and kids? Are they here? Are they okay?"" I look behind Richard, the CNA is holding up a clipboard with his information on it. 

Richard Hamilton, 54 years old. Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Manager of a small financial firm, wife of 30 years, two kids in high school. Reason for admission: extremely rapid cell division when experiencing anger.

Great, he's already pretty pissed, now I have to make sure he doesn't flip out.

""Your family is safe and sound in Cincinnati. You are here for medical testing, so that we can figure out what is going on with you."" I said.

""Well, can I at least call them? I've got to let them know I'm alright."" He said. That would be a bad idea. At this point Richard here has most certainly been declared dead. The Switchers probably tossed a shell of him off a building or something.

Maybe I could talk to IT about making a chat bot of his family? What would the ethics of that even be? He's never going to see them again, but it would keep him happy. A memory wipe would be the simplest, but to erase that much data from a brain would probably cause early on set dementia. Then it would be harder to keep him under control.

""I'm afraid our phone lines are down at the moment."" I said.

""Could I do an email then?""

""I'll see what I can do. Just do what,"" I looked at the CNA's name tag. ""Bridgette here tells you too. We'll get you a nice cup of coffee, doesn't that sound good?""

""I, I guess that makes sense."" Even I could see the disappointment in his face.

""Alright, I'll talk to someone about getting you a laptop."" I said as a started walking again. After a few step I can feel my face go back to normal. It's exhausting to wear that mask.

I finally reach my office. I could feel a headache coming but I needed to type out a few more words.

""Doctor Opal Gallagher to the administrator's office, Doctor Opal Gallagher to the administrator's office.""

I put on my headphones to block out anymore noise. I booted up the facility's media streamer and opened my music playlist. I hit play and was able to get into a work frenzy to the sound of Tool's Sober.

By the time I was finished Gojira was playing. I checked the time, 22:00 exact. I checked my schedule for tomorrow. Just as I thought, a five hour block had been booked for an autopsy. It's going to be a long day tomorrow.

I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes. The headache is worse now.

I slowly start to feel my blood flowing in my veins. My head pulses in rythem with my heart. There's too much blood in me. I have to get rid of it. In my younger days I let the blood go down the drain, now it seems so wasteful.

I get up. The hematology lab isn't far. At this time of night they should have clocked out by now. I use my badge to get in. The lights turn on and I sit at the phlebotomy mechine.

It's difficult to find a good place for the needle to go in when you've donated as much blood as me. As a medical professional it's not out of my scope, I went with my left arm that day.

I'll be honest, I know it's self destructive to do this. I've had collapsed veins and passed out before. I've had hypovolemic shock. I know I'm mentally ill. I always have been. This is my normal. Really, I'm just wasting time till death.

As my lifeblood is drained I feel useful at least. I have negative O blood. If anyone should give blood it's me. We do have an oxygen rich solution that can be used as a temporary repreave from blood loss, but it's structure is unstable. It dissolves fast, but it buys us up to two hours depending on the person's size and prior health conditions.

Not that health conditions exist here beyond the residents. They're concidered too valuble as research subjects to fix them. When you arrive here you under go a procedure. You are sanitized, inside and out. Any outside germs or bacteria is not allowed. Along with disability. Missing limbs, arthritis, almost anything you could think of.

I used to wear glasses. I used to have scoliosis and asthma. But I was changed. I was fixed. Made better.

The printer can make new organs. The most it can do is create an entire human body, an empty shell. We've been able to program them for short things. It's just making the right electrical signals go off at the right time. The shells have no free will. No soul.

I stop the blood collection machine.

There's a liter of blood connected to it. Roughly speaking, a human has about five liters in their bodies.

I take out the needle and remove the tourniquet. I dress the wound and get up, wobbling. I used the wall to keep myself steady. My head is among the stars. My part is done. The phlebotomy mechine will do the rest.

Ours have more automatic abilities than what you find at the average hospital. Our machines are able to take blood, clean it, bag it, and refrigerate it. They even have a centrifuge option and hemoglobin analyzer.

I make my way out the door, trying to not seem suspicious as I make my way back to my office. I assume this is what it feels like when you're drunk. Alcohol is something I've never understood the need for.

I finally get back to my office. I fling my small fridge's door open and down a half a cartoon of orange juice.

If someone that only knew my sister saw this, would they think I was her? No. She would never do this. Not the perfect one.

I take a blood replacement serum and inject it into my thigh. I screwed up. I wouldn't have to waste one of these if I had just stopped being a masochist for five seconds and turn off the mechine. I should have never figured out how to override the safety program.

I disposed of the needle in a secret sharps container. Technically, I wasn't supposed to give injections in my office, but it's my body. I can at least have the autonomy to stab myself and dispose of it safely.

God I'm tired...

I flip the light switch and crash onto the cot Alan had been sitting on earlier. My breathing hard, my pulse fast. Maybe I'll die tonight. That's fine. They can throw my body in the harvester. Nothing gets wasted here, not even the dead.

Having a soul isn't all that great.

The kind where the fog hangs so low over the mountains it feels like it’s swallowing the world. The cabin I’d booked wasn’t far from the lake, but I took the long road anyway, winding between old pine trees and stone walls. The retreat organizers had sent me a brochure with photos of rustic cabins, smiling faces, and perfectly brewed coffee on sunlit decks. I didn’t come for any of that. I came because I had to.

My real life had stopped feeling like mine weeks ago. My apartment smelled like burnt popcorn and regret, my bank account kept reminding me I was a failure, and every email I sent seemed wrong. So I did what any person desperate for reinvention would do, I assumed someone else’s identity.

Her name was Elena, a mid-thirties writer whose work I’d stumbled across in a dusty corner of a secondhand bookstore. She wrote beautiful short stories, the kind that made you feel like you were eavesdropping on someone’s soul. When I found out she’d canceled her spot at the retreat last minute, I saw my opportunity. I printed her email confirmations, made a fake ID that looked passable enough, and memorized her favorite coffee order. If I could be Elena for a week, maybe, just maybe, I could stop feeling like me.

The cabin smelled like cedar and damp earth when I walked in, exactly how I imagined it. I set my bag down, careful not to make a sound. The other participants trickled in over the next hour, all cheerful and unsuspecting. They hadn’t met Elena before, and they didn’t know me. It was perfect.

No one questioned my presence. I smiled, I nodded, I sipped coffee with exaggerated elegance. I let them talk about their lives, their writing habits, their published works. I laughed in the right places, asked questions in the right tones. Every glance in the mirror reminded me I was playing a part, my real face hidden behind someone else’s story.

But it wasn’t just about pretending. I wanted to see how far I could push it. I slipped into Elena’s habits: her morning jog around the lake, her notebook filled with unfinished drafts, the way she always carried a worn leather journal everywhere. I even wore her favorite scarf, the one with tiny embroidered stars, because habits are harder to fake than faces.

The first night, we gathered around the firepit, sharing our “deepest truths” with strangers who were, for now, our audience. I told a story about a woman lost in a foggy forest, who wandered for days before realizing the forest was never outside, it was inside her. Everyone nodded, murmuring in empathy. They thought I was telling Elena’s story, but in reality, I was narrating my own.

By the third day, the other participants began to warm up to me. I knew more about their lives than they knew about mine. They shared secrets, ambitions, regrets. I hoarded them like currency. But with every confession I absorbed, the walls between me and Elena started to crumble. I was no longer acting. I was her, at least in their eyes.

Then came the evening writing workshop. The instructor asked us to read our work aloud. My hands shook as I opened Elena’s notebook and read a story she had left unfinished. Every word, every sentence, felt like trespassing, but also liberation. I felt alive in a way I hadn’t in years, like I was allowed to exist without the weight of my own failures.

That night, as I lay in the cabin listening to the lake lapping against the shore, I realized I wasn’t sure if I wanted to go back. Who was I if I left Elena behind? And if someone asked about her, if someone tried to reach her… what would I say?

The truth was, I didn’t know. I had no plan. I only knew I had found a version of myself I could breathe in, one that wasn’t me, and yet somehow felt more real than the me I had abandoned.

And so, when the retreat ended, and the others packed their bags and hugged goodbye, I walked out of the cabin not as me. Not as Elena. But as someone in between, a shadow with her own voice, ready to write a story that didn’t belong to anyone but me.",2,1755348022.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False
1mru3ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1mru3ox/week_in_the_life_of_a_saas_founder_ama/,Week in the life of a SaaS founder. AMA,"Some context.  
I’m building a SaaS in the productivity space, focused on project/task management.

Right now, I spend about 70% of my time running my web development agency, which is my main source of income, and 30% on my SaaS. I’ll dedicate more time to it as it grows financially.

This isn’t a quick MVP — I started working on it in my free time back in 2016 and launched it publicly in late 2022. It’s fully bootstrapped, with no outside investors. Because my agency work pays well, I can afford to keep funding development myself.

Honestly, the best place I’ve found for genuine feedback so far has been Reddit — I’ve gotten way more useful responses here than on X or LinkedIn.

**My schedule**  
The first thing I do each day is start light and go for a coffee.  
When I get back, I use my app to plan my day. I rarely plan in advance — I prefer to do it day by day.

The first task is checking analytics for my 3 businesses and YouTube channel.  
After that, I focus on client projects from my agency.  
Then I move on to SaaS tasks — usually programming or marketing.

I’ve seen people say “building a SaaS is easy, marketing is hard.” Personally, I think both are difficult if you’re doing them alone — but either can be easy if you have capital to hire good people.

Finding truly great software talent is harder (and more expensive) than most expect. If you want quality work, it takes serious time and money to put the right team together.

Since I haven’t hired anyone, I can say that building everything myself has been much tougher than the marketing side. To make a solid software product, you need to be really strong in either frontend or backend development, and at least decent in the other. Getting great at one can easily take 5 years, plus another 1–2 years to get solid at the other.

During the day, I take coffee breaks and catch up with friends.  
At the end of the week, I use a feature I built — an “AI weekly summary” — to review how things went. Because I log tasks daily and track time in the app, the AI actually has solid context to work with.

For all project and task management, I rely on my own app. I use it for planning, reminders, notes, reviews, and comments — basically everything related to tasks.

1mru1g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1mru1g1/revisiting_things/,Revisiting Things,"Full disclosure...three years ago, I (55F) wasn't in a good place. I was drinking and pretty much not caring about what happened to me. I had a Summer of Bad Decisions which included ""relationships"" that I cared about even less than I cared about myself. I was still deep in grief from losing my husband, in the grips of an addiction, etc. Ok, all that said...

I started using FB Dating and one of the men from THAT summer liked me. At first I was just going to delete it, but instead I matched with him and said something to the effect of ""you remember me, right?"" He kind of hesitated, but then did say he remembered me. He apologized for the way he had acted and asked to sit down and talk, maybe meet for a drink or coffee. I was very hell no, but then we texted a bit, he called me, and I got a better feeling about things.

Long story short (is it too late to say that?) we ended up having dinner together last night. He cooked for me and we watched a couple of movies. It was all very comfortable and relaxing...I always did love his house. He actually fell asleep for a while, so obviously he felt comfortable too.

He's a good match for me on paper. Is a teacher, has an MA degree, was a Navy Seabee and works his off time helping to flip houses. He's a great cook, a dad of a college sophomore, has two dogs, lives about a mile from me. The attraction is there, but I suspect there are some scars from being in Afghanistan as he can be distant and doesn't smile much. 

I date a lot and am comfortable spending time with men, have good boundaries now and know myself better. I had been to his house several times, which is why I didn't really think much of going over for dinner. I know the whole safety thing...I let a friend know where I was and to check in on me, etc.

Anyway, how many of you have revisited dating experiences that started out as just hookups? I was clear with him that that isn't what I'm interested in now and that I wasn't going to sleep with him again...at least not for a while. It wasn't awkward, he was respectful, we had an enjoyable night. I'm just wondering if it's possible to really go backwards with things?",5,1755347798.0,datingoverfifty,5,0.86,False

1mrtywd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mrtywd/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_uncle_doesnt_help/,AITA for being upset that my uncle doesn’t help with my grandmother’s care?,"
I (32F) live with my Aunt “Linda” and Uncle “Dave.” I don’t pay rent, I know that matters, but I help take care of my grandmother “Mary” (84), who has Alzheimer’s, dementia, and kidney failure. I also have a 2-year-old son.

For four days out of the week, I’m basically in the house 12+ hours straight with both a toddler and an elderly woman who needs constant care. My aunt works, so it’s usually me, my son, and Grandma at home all day.

Here’s where I’m struggling: I literally never get a break. If I want to step out, even just to grab groceries or breathe outside for a minute, I can’t go alone. I always have to take my son, because if my aunt leaves to run errands, my uncle insists that he’s the one who gets to go while I stay behind with Grandma and my son. In the last three months, the only time I got out of the house alone (without my toddler) was when my aunt took me with her to shop for sheets for Grandma. That’s it. Three months, one outing.

What frustrates me is that my uncle knew what he was signing up for. He dated my aunt while she was already living with and caring for Grandma. Then he married her, moved into the house with them, and now that they’ve bought their first home, Grandma had to move in too. He refuses to help because he’s “uncomfortable” since she strips, has accidents, and sometimes wears nothing but a diaper. I get that it’s uncomfortable for a son-in-law to see. But the reality is his wife is burning out, and so am I, yet he does nothing.

To be clear: no care facility will take my grandmother. Either her illnesses are beyond what they can manage, or the cost is impossibly high. If I did work, there would be no one to stay with Grandma during the day. My uncle flat-out refuses to watch her or my son. So regardless of whether I have a job, the responsibility falls on me and my aunt.

And it’s not like I’m asking for much. I’m not trying to party with friends or go out every night. I just want a few hours alone here and there, maybe once a month, to run errands without dragging along a screaming toddler, or to sit down with a cup of coffee and read a book in peace. I don’t need whole days away. I just need some breathing room.

But every time I bring this up, I’m told no. I’m shut down. I feel like I’m being treated as an unlimited source of free labor because I don’t pay rent, while my uncle takes zero responsibility despite marrying into this situation knowingly.

So… AITA for being upset that my uncle doesn’t help and for wanting a few hours to myself every once in a while? And for the people who are wondering ""where is the dad"" he died last year.

I wake up in a dusty gothic crypt. You say ""Take my hand. Do not fear."" and leads me to a window. ""Look, the sun is rising over the horizon.

You point to and old, worn coffin on the stone floor and say ""That coffin over there is the place for your daytime sleep. Go to sleep now, I will do the same.""

I've been trying to find a fic/story like this it's been on my mind for so long nowww (the fic isn't confined to a fandom it can be your oc btw) 

We have three main characters, let's call them Vince, Kath, James (yes ik this has the same names as a movie but that was the closest thing I could think of since the story has two guys. The characters in the movie are in no way the same as the characters I'm going to talk about... Probably.) 
the story takes place in this prestigious university, Vince, Kath, and James get accepted. They all have history, by that I mean in senior year of highschool James moves to a different school as well as Vince and Kath, so it's the first time they've met. James is immediately smitten with Kath, but Kath likes Vince, I mean he's tall, rich, athletic.. but extremely dumb, I mean the guy bribed his way into the school. James continues to fall as well as Kath falling for Vince, but James and Kath form a group with a couple of other people. Then Vince tries to join, they let him but he immediately goes for Kath (I mean he openly flirts, gives extravagant gifts, etc.). So Kath accepts and they start dating, James gets pushed away, him and Vince get in a fight and the group breaks. One side stays with James the other stays with Vince. This continues as the new normal for them till graduation and summer. James graduates top of their batch and summer starts. Then we get to admissions week, they all take a college admissions tests. 
They all pass, and that's where our story begins, James and Kath get a dorm together surprisingly (let's just assume the person in charge of choosing dorm mates didn't have space to put Kath with another girl). Then they slowly rekindle their friendship, the line between friends and lovers blur. And one day, one of them hears a comment, ""are you two a couple"" or something then they truly ask themselves if they are one or aren't. They say it's complicated/""idk"" till one of them stands up and admits (not right there, but maybe a few weeks later). So now they're in a relationship, and they don't fuck in the dorms they don't do that yet, because.. well I want this story to be calm not smutty (sorry to all the horndogs that were getting ready) but more like a calm love, kissing in an empty stairwell, coffee dates, walk at the parks, late-night study sessios, etc.
(P.S. Vince meddles with their relationship but ultimately fails.)
Key points: 
- College/uni au 
-Friends to lovers (ultra slow cooking burn)
-Love triangle ( where two characters love only 1, and ends up dating only 1)
- Calm/gentle love
- No heavy partying, cheating, excessive angst (yes in the story Vince's mother is dead but it's not that major of a death.)

___

**January 22nd, 2016.** 

As expected, my designated human selected me. I have completed my research, and am ready to undertake my fifteenth companionship. It is a great honour to be selected for another mission, as always, a huge thank you to Lord Snuffles, leader of dog-kind.


After living lives as small breeds, it will take some adjusting to this new body. Shaggy hair, golden-blonde, luckily my research tells me that my human should groom me. Not like the last one -- in fourteen years, he did not bathe me once. Unthinkable.


___


I found it tucked beneath Toby’s bed — a small black journal, the handwriting neat, almost elegant.

The first entry was dated the day I brought him home from the shelter.

For a moment, I just stared at it. It didn’t make sense.


___


**February 5th, 2016.** 


As they often are, the first days of my move have been rather hectic. I have not had an opportunity to write, especially since my human lets me sleep on his bed. 


There have been some vast improvements in quality-of-life compared to previous ones: the food I am given tastes like real meat, I am allowed on the sofas (and as mentioned, the bed), I get several walks a day and there are no little humans to pull my hair. 


I am hopeful that I am succeeding in my purpose. I offer him all of the love and companionship that should be expected. He cries less than when I first met him, spends less time in his bed as well. 


It seems the photo of his prior human companion is the real trouble. It may take time, but we will get through it together. As is a dog's purpose.


___


I closed the book and sat there with it in my hands.

""Prior human companion."" The phrase stuck. He couldn’t possibly know about her. I hadn’t said her name once, and the photo stayed buried in the nightstand.

I told myself I’d stop. Then I turned the page.

___


**February 8th, 2016** 

Progress has been observed. My human smiled twice today, once when I returned the stolen sock and once when I placed my head beneath his hand and kept it there until he remembered to pet me. He is learning quickly.

The photograph remains the problem. It is kept face down in a drawer. I have moved it to the table by the window where the light is kind -- was told *no* for carrying it around in my mouth.

An acceptable cost.

New protocol: We wake early and sit in the morning sun. Then walk. Then food. 

He calls me Toby and I respond to it gladly.

As is a dog's purpose.

___

None of this made sense. It could not be possible. I pinched myself, just in case. Thought, not for the first time, that I should show the book to somebody to make sure it was actually real.

But I couldn't put it down, not now. 

I had to know more. 

I flicked through a few pages, each of them meticulously written, dated, a lump in my throat. It was far too elaborate to be any kind of joke.

Stopping on a random page, closer to the end, I read.

___


**October 13th, 2024.**

Life is good. Each night I make sure my human is asleep before I let myself drift. I can hear it in his breathing. It soothes me, knowing that my presence allows sleep to come to him so easily. It happens frequently, in his bed, on the sofa. 

I do find our walks more difficult. The aches in my legs give me pause. When he throws the stick, I smile at him. It hurts, but I return it. Every time.

He cannot see the pain in my eyes, yet. Perhaps he notices the slowness in my gait, or the hesitation before I run...

___

I could not finish it. The book snapped shut in my hands. *Perhaps he notices the slowness in my gait,* I blinked away the tears, looking at the nearby wall.

""What is this..."" I whispered to myself. 

I had to finish it.

___

...but run I must. 

The sun brings pleasure, our walks spark joy, and yet nothing makes my tail wag more than my human. The smile on his face as I bring back the object he throws -- the ball, the stick, it matters not.

I will do as he wishes, as is a dog's purpose. 

___

I imagined him there, at the end of my bed, writing in the middle of the night. 

Why had he kept this? For what purpose? I began to turn the page, but stopped myself.

I had to see.

I flipped to the back of the book. 

___

**February 28th, 2025.**

This will be my last writing. Even now as I write, I can feel that gnawing pull that all dogs are familiar with. 

We are given such a short time, and with it we have one purpose. I can only pray to Lord Snuffles' that I have served mine.

**Master,** or, **James.** It feels strange to be writing your name, here. It feels even stranger to be writing directly to you. 

It is not usual for a dog to leave their journal, in fact, it is against every law that we live by. I will be in great trouble once I return to my people, to be prepared for my next designation. 

An acceptable cost.

I could not leave this life without thanking you. In fourteen of my other companionships, none have given me the life and love that you have provided. Even now as I write these words, and my life slowly slips away, I feel my tail softly wagging.

Know this: I do not control it. Every excited bark. Every time that my tail wagged so hard that you even got frustrated at the tapping. It was because of you. 

I was designated to you to help you cope with the loss of your human, and in turn, you became my human. Moreso than any before you, and I am not afraid to say, far more than any following you. 

Do not feel my loss as an absence. Feel it as an opportunity. 

She wanted for you to adopt me, I know that now. She wants you to be happy, and so do I.

Your best friend, 

Toby 🐾

___

I looked up from my seat, tears stinging my eyes. I looked to the upturned dog-bed, the one that I was about to take to the tip. Where I'd found his journal.

The coffee table was cluttered with empty beer cans and a half-drunk whisky. My head throbbed from the night before. I had nothing. Nobody. Just as alone as before him.

But his message was clear.

I placed the journal in the bedside table, next to the photo, and grabbed my keys.

The nearest animal shelter was twenty minutes away. I must have looked wild when I burst inside.

""May I see your dogs?"" I asked, breathless.

The woman behind the counter laughed.

""Gee, seems like an emergency.""

She was the one who'd first brought me to meet Toby. I'd thought she was kind. Sweet. She wasn't wearing a ring then. She wasn't wearing one now.

*She wants you to be happy, and so do I.*

I took a breath. ""Maybe I shouldn't rush the decision.""

""No?"" She tilted her head.

""No. But if you're free... maybe you could help me pick one. Over coffee?""

Her eyebrows lifted, and she smiled. ""Coffee sounds nice.""",1,1755347465.0,CamsWriting,0,1.0,False

might delete this later but this guy (m21?) is dating my bestfriend (21, she's trans) for a few months now. at first, i (f20) really thought na he's great naman. i'd say he's conventionally attractive, well mannered, and generally nice. so im really so boto sa relationship nila and after some time, i became good friends with him na rin.

pero he's acting so weird these days. idk if this is normal cause we became ""friends"" na. pero he's been giving me random gifts and foods, he kept on being playful with me, he'd tease me, and do things like ruffle my hair or pinch my cheek. 

i kinda told our other friends about this, asking them if this is something to tell my bff about, but they said na baka he's just really nice. and i don't want naman to insist na he's into me.

but just the other day, my bestie had her 21st birthday. then, nung end na ng party, he offered to drive me home, my bestie agreed naman din cause it's like midnight na, she just joked to keep the windows down.

pero when we arrived sa dorm ko, he asked if he can come in daw kasi naiihi sya. after using the toilet, he asked if i could make him a coffee daw kasi medyo naka inom sya kanina. 

tapos while im making one, he went to me, then to my surprise, he f×cking leaned to me then humawak sa waist ko. then he said something like do i know raw ba na he likes me, i thought it was just a joke so i said something like he's crazy cause he's literally dating my bff. but then he told me na would i date him daw ba if he end things with my friend. 

i panicked so hard that i just pushed him away until he gets out of my place without saying anything.

i wanted to cry that night. and the next morning, he was spamming me, apologizing and saying na he was just drunk and he didn't mean to disrespect me. but that's not just the only issue, im feeling so guilty right now cause i haven't told my friend about it. i want to tell her but im so scared na she'll be mad at me rin. how do i deal with this:<

edit: i know the best way is to tell her about this. but is there a way to make sure na she won't be mad at me? or to make sure she won't be that hurt? 

im also thinking na if i opt not to tell her, I'll just talk to him to have him break up with her and just disappear, and my bestfriend and i can just go back to our old lives

For instance some may choose to scrimp all year to enable them to go on holiday for 2 weeks - maybe stay at a fancy resort or travel to far flung places. Someone else may choose to do without the holiday but enjoy weekly coffees, cinema trips, meals out with friends etc

Is there an objectively preferable tactic when it comes to overall life satisfaction and enjoyment?

Maintaining excellent dental hygiene is more than just a daily chore – it's a critical investment in your overall health and well-being. A comprehensive dental care routine can prevent cavities, gum disease, and numerous other oral health issues that can impact your quality of life. Most people underestimate the power of a consistent and thorough dental hygiene approach, but the truth is that your oral health is a window to your overall physical condition. By implementing a strategic dental care routine, you can protect your teeth, boost your confidence, and potentially save thousands of dollars in future dental treatments.

Understanding the Foundations of Dental Hygiene

The Importance of a Comprehensive Dental Care Routine

A truly effective dental hygiene routine goes far beyond simple brushing. It encompasses a holistic approach that includes proper techniques, the right tools, and consistent care. **Dental health experts agree** that a comprehensive routine can significantly reduce the risk of tooth decay, gum disease, and other oral health complications.

Key Components of an Optimal Dental Hygiene Routine:
• Proper brushing technique
• Regular flossing
• Consistent mouthwash use
• Balanced diet
• Regular dental check-ups

Brushing: The Cornerstone of Dental Care

Mastering the Perfect Brushing Technique

Effective brushing is more than just a quick scrub. The American Dental Association recommends:
1. Brush for at least two minutes, twice daily
2. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
3. Hold your brush at a 45-degree angle to the gums
4. Use gentle, circular motions
5. Clean all surfaces of your teeth – outer, inner, and chewing surfaces

Choosing the Right Toothbrush and Toothpaste

Not all toothbrushes are created equal. **Electric toothbrushes** can be more effective at removing plaque, with some studies showing up to 21% more plaque removal compared to manual brushing. Look for toothpastes with fluoride and consider your specific dental needs.

The Critical Role of Flossing

Why Flossing Cannot Be Overlooked

Flossing removes plaque and food particles that brushing can't reach. Surprisingly, 30% of people never floss, putting themselves at significant risk for dental problems. Proper flossing:
• Prevents gum disease
• Reduces bad breath
• Helps prevent tooth decay
• Removes hidden food particles

Flossing Techniques for Maximum Effectiveness
- Use about 18 inches of floss
- Gently slide between teeth
- Curve floss around each tooth in a C-shape
- Use a fresh section of floss for each tooth

Mouthwash: The Finishing Touch

Beyond Fresh Breath: The Health Benefits of Mouthwash

Mouthwash is not just about fresh breath. Antibacterial mouthwashes can:
• Reduce plaque
• Prevent gingivitis
• Kill harmful bacteria
• Reach areas brushing and flossing might miss

Selecting the Right Mouthwash for Your Needs

Consider alcohol-free options if you have sensitive mouth tissues. Look for mouthwashes with fluoride for additional cavity protection.

Diet and Dental Health

Foods That Promote Oral Health

Your diet plays a crucial role in dental hygiene. Foods that support dental health include:
• Calcium-rich foods (dairy, leafy greens)
• Crunchy fruits and vegetables
• Green and black teas
• Foods high in phosphorus

Foods to Avoid
- Sugary snacks and drinks
- Acidic foods
- Sticky candies
- Excessive coffee and alcohol

Madischild and Echo took long enough to stop staring at me in stunned silence for Pantheon’s laughter to die down. Pantheon had predicted my plan already. She’s known me for long enough to know that I would have just gotten to the statement and left if I did not have another agenda. The other two did not expect someone who just dressed them down to want to give in to their objective, so to speak.  
  
It was a fairly simple decision. Being a Guardian would give me some benefits, and it was not something I could not quit if I wanted to.  
  
Giving my statement was simple enough. It was a video recorded interview. I told my side of the story. They could play either the video or just the audio in the courtroom. There was a written transcript as well.  
  
“Now… Let’s get to the meat of this, so to speak.” Madischild said. “Err, not to infer anything about you Mr. Kyong.”  
  
This world was still roughly the same as earth was in the 1980s and 1990s when it came to Human Resources and political correctness. It likely would be in the early stages of it for much longer than my world was as well, given how few men there were. Some businesses would likely have a men’s bathroom for years by some legal mandate while never having a male in their employ.  
  
“Relax.” I shook my head. I went to take a drink of a provided coffee. “Unless you are deliberately crass I am not going to take offense. I am not made of glass.” A statement all three women looked dubious of.  
  
In the time it took to get my statement Madischild had called a secretary to get us all refreshments. A coffee for me, with far more cream and sugar than I would have taken in my last life. This body needed it though. Pantheon and Madischild had tea, though Pantheon’s was an iced tea. Echo it seemed was more of a soda fan. She had a brand called strike which was an equivalent of sprite.  
  
“Right. So, not to shoot a gift-horse in the mouth, I find myself needing to ask why. You did not give me the impression of someone that would be willing to join up with the speech earlier.” She folded her arms over each other on the table.  
  
“I have various reasons. It’s been weighing on my mind since the fight with Mad Wolf. If it is something I cannot get out of my head, and I am asking others about it, then it is something I want to do and I am just looking for excuses not to.” I frowned at my cup. It was too sweet for my tastes mentally, but perfect for my actual taste-buds. The dissonance was disturbing.  
  
“Why would you feel you need an excuse not to? I can assure you if danger is your concern we can keep you from situations that are too dangerous.” She sounded concerned in a genuine way.  
  
I laughed. It was a bitter one. I shook my head and felt the warmth of the mug in my hand to calm my nerves. Madischild just looked confused. Echo and Pantheon already knew though.  
  
“No, I am not afraid of danger. I hate you. I hate this, this organization that has the gall to call themselves heroes. I just am finding that the pros may outweigh the cons, if just barely.” It had been years, but the words that spilled out of me still had all of the anger that they had when I had first awakened to my powers.  
  
I watched Madischild’s expression sour. Then she tried to put back up her plastic smile and I shook my head.  
  
“None of that. I hate lies, and that smile is a lie. If you are upset at me, be upset at me. I will not play a guessing game on how you really feel.” My words were direct and to the point. It had the desired effect. She allowed herself to frown again.  
  
“I trust you can understand that part of my job is to present a positive front at most times Mr. Kyong. Still… you want to join an organization you hate?” She asked with curiosity.  
  
I looked around. Echo and Pantheon were trying to disengage. They looked at each other as if they were having a conversation without words, complete with hand gestures and shrugs. They did not look at Madischild or me.  
  
“For now. I have my reasons, they are personal.” I ran a finger around the edge of my glass.   
  
The truth was that I would not be able to do what I wanted to do entirely solo. I was not strong enough to lead a gang let alone take one on alone, and unlike gangs you could quit The Guardians. Someone had come for people I cared about, I needed to correct that. The Guardians would be a stepping stone.  
  
“While I am willing to move on to other topics for now, you understand I will need to know eventually? For the background check if nothing else.” Her brow knit at me. She was not satisfied, but she would have to stay that way.  
  
“I will do any of the needed paperwork and steps to join. Perhaps we can move on to the rundown of what is needed, what the responsibilities of membership entail, and what the benefits are?” The truth was I just wanted to move past the question of why. No one was fooled. It did not matter if they knew however.  
  
“Verywell. For requirements, there is a week we take to do a background check. Though the check starts when the paperwork for it is done and not before. There is an interview. Then we evaluate your powers. After that you are given a mental aptitude test similar to the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. Though ours is a little more in depth with optional extended portions for super intelligence.” She paused.  
  
“Err… After that is the physical. One where I will apologize in advance for Mr. Kyong, but there are no male doctors with the clearance level needed.” She sounded rather apologetic at that.  
  
“It’s fine. I would attest that I am not your typical male, but I am gathering that Pantheon has told you more than enough.” I chuckled a little at that. Part of it was that it was a light Jab and Pantheon, the other part was the way Madischild went plastic immediately after.  
  
“She’s been very… descriptive of your development since you entered the foster care system Mr. Kyong. Some might say proud, some might say frustrated.” She ventured cautiously.  
  
“I still have the mud picture. I break it out whenever any of the new girls shows too much curiosity about you.” She said with a cheeky smile. “It is a little like having a cute grandson.”  
  
I rubbed my eyes fighting back adolescent embarrassment. The mud picture was the time when she took me out from the orphanage to a carnival. A misunderstanding with some local women ended up with me on the racing track drenched in mud. Naturally Pantheon took a picture before helping me un-stick my legs.  
  
“She calls you a Hellion who is too smart for his own good. I am starting to see some of what she means.” Echo chimed in. She annoyed me, but part of me knew it was less the woman and more what she represented.  
  
“I suppose there are worse pictures you could be spreading.” I sighed.  
  
“Gabe, you're nineteen. I don’t have the pictures of you forgetting you are a man. The people with those pictures get arrested.” She said a little incredulously.  
  
“Ah, yeah, sorry. I wasn’t making that sort of accusation.” It took a moment for something to click in my head. “People actually got pictures of those incidents?”  
  
“You tried to go swimming outside of a men’s beach when you were sixteen!” She laughed.  
  
That had happened. No one had explained how beaches worked to me, I did not really have parental figures for non-school topics. Pantheon could only show up so much.  
  
Beaches did not have a dress code. Men made up twenty percent of the population, so rather than make a dress code for it, it was easier to just keep men out. Just about every activity a person can think of with communal nudity was that way. In the modern era that meant that if a man went to a beach it had to be a men allowed beach, also called a men’s beach.  
  
Needless to say, my beach trip was short lived and the proper dress code for men from that day on was drilled into my head.  
  
“If we could get back on track?” It seemed it was Madischild’s turn to be exasperated. Echo for her part just glowered and looked extremely uncomfortable.  
  
“Yes. Sorry about that. Are there requirements past the physical?” I tried to pull myself back into a professional mindset.  
  
“Not to join. After you join though there is federal mandated therapy that all Guardians need to go through. After that you get your benefits. You start out with lesser arresting powers. In short the actual arresting and charging is made by regular police. You just gain a greater ability to call them to you or drag someone down to be arrested than a normal citizen. As you go up in the ranks you get more trust in that area.”  
  
She folded her once hand over another. “You will be expected to be on call for any disaster your power can help with. There are laws however that will stop it from interfering with your civilian life as much as possible. I would talk about our hidden identity program, but you do not have one nor could we make you one.  
  
“Therapy?” I could feel myself starting to freeze up. My life was busy enough, I did not need to waste hours a week talking to a shrink.  
  
“… Yes Mr. Kyong. Everyone who has powers gets them from traumatic events. In response to that event your biology handed you a gun that you cannot put down. Naturally the government does not want people with powers like yours to have authority unless they are absolutely sure of you being back in the best possible mental health. All powered members of the guardians have mandated weekly sessions with an appointed psychiatric therapist.”  
  
It was not the answer I wanted, and when I looked over Pantheon had gone so far to avoid my glare as to turn her chair entirely towards the open window of the room, with her back to me. I reached out and gently flicked her in the back of the head out of frustration.  
  
“Ow, dammit Gabe.” She said, holding the back of her head.  
  
“You knew about this.” I said simply before I looked back at Madischild. She gave me a curious expression and I answered. “The foster care system assigned me therapy as well. I am not a fan.”  
  
She frowned at that but did not challenge it.  
  
“Why don’t we move on to the interview? I understand you do not wish to share why you wish to join at the moment. The Guardians is not like most jobs where you need to sell yourself in that sense. As long as you can follow the rules and order that tends to be enough for the higher-ups provided you perform well in the areas we need.” She started matter of factly.  
  
I could appreciate the earnest approach. Madischild had managed to observe and adapt her approach to me in the short time between stepping foot in the office to now. It was impressive in a way and I could see why she was in charge of what she was.  
  
“So in the interest of that. What are your powers?”  
  
“I have two powers of note.” I raised a hand with two fingers up as I spoke. “My increased body size is accompanied by a further increase of physical strength and durability past what my size and musculature would suggest.” I put down a finger.  
  
“And the Second?” She was taking notes now and had her eyes more on the paper than me.  
  
“The momentum power you already know about. Though the general movement of my body is not all that increases as I move. I also think faster, gain increased durability, and get stronger based on how fast I am moving.” I lowered the second finger.  
  
She tsked which prompted a curious look from me. She did not answer, instead asking a follow up question.  
  
“Any known weaknesses or limits to either?”  
  
“I can pretty easily lift around a ton, and I can withstand any impact I can put out. As for the speed. It’s based on fluid momentum. If I am halted in some way or turn too sharply it stops and resets everything I have built up to base levels instantly.”  
  
There was another tsk from her and she frowned at the pad of paper.  
  
“Is there a problem?” I had a feeling I knew what it was already.  
  
“She was hoping you would have non-combat powers. Or that if you had combat powers they would be strong enough that nothing could hurt you, or weak enough you would not be considered a threat. What you have told us pretty much makes you the first one a villain will try to take out. You aren’t durable enough to be entirely bullet proof from the sounds of it either.” Echo confirmed for me.  
  
“Which means that when I eventually get hurt, you are going to have a P.R. nightmare.” I ventured towards Madischild after giving a nod to Echo.  
  
“Are you aware of why men are not allowed in the infantry Mr. Kyong?” She asked, giving me a grave look.  
  
I contemplated her for a moment. I could guess easily enough. It was likely the same reason women were not allowed in the infantry in my last life.  
  
“It is the protective instinct of the women. A woman could accept another woman dying in war. If a man died they would shut down in the middle of the fight from the feeling of failure in protecting them.” It was pretty much the reason that had come to mind, just with the genders reversed.  
  
“If your teamates think you are in any sort of danger they will be suicidal in their protection of you.” Echo again. It made sense, this issue was more her ballpark as the team leader. “You are dangerous if ignored, and you could be solved with a sniper round. The only woman on our team that would be callous enough to let you get shot is probably one of very few that could survive any weapon fired at you.”  
  
“And I am strong enough that not calling me to large threat battles is also an issue. Given enough momentum I could tip a battle so you will be criticized if you lose another cape because you decided to leave me behind.” It was met with a nod from Echo.  
  
“Which is while Emily looks so upset. You are a threat to your team by no fault of your own, and leaving you off the teams is a threat to this branch of The Guardians as a whole. And the moment something goes wrong Emily is the one they will expect to fix it.” Pantheon added in.  
  
She got out of the chair next to me and went to put a hand on Emily Madischild’s back. The woman blinked up at her and she set a hand on the pencil in her hand.  
  
“You’re thinking too hard Emily. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. I’ll help where I can, yeah?” She smiled down at her.  
  
Emily seemed to relax some at that and then sighed, rubbing the back of her neck.  
  
“It’s not like I am in a hurry to jump into hectic battles of attrition. You can figure out a solution while I am in whatever training phases you have.” I offered.  
  
“I will have to negotiate keeping you in extended training with the hire ups while we figure it out. Are you okay with that Mr. Kyong?” She asked cautiously. “Everything we have on you suggest you are part of the masculinist movement and I woul-”  
  
I put up a hand to stop her. That assumption was getting old.  
  
“I am not a masculinist. Not in the sense you are thinking. I do believe in equal rights for everyone. I am also, however, a practical person. If the reason for keeping me out of the team for now is to correct the behavior of the women I would be working with I can understand.”  
  
I waited a moment and let the good sink in before I continued with the bad so they did not hear only the bad. 	“However, I will ask that it not be a perpetual thing, and that if I do well on your training I will be given arresting rights. I will stay to un-powered crimes until you feel the others can work with me safely.”  
  
I drank my coffee while I waited for them to mull over my stipulation. Madischild was the one to break the silence.  
  
“We can make that work.” She said with a more firm nod. “Now, for public appearance. I will escort you to the costume department when all is said and done as I need to sign off on any costume you get. How do you feel about public speaking and public appearances on behalf of the guardians?”  
  
“Dubious.” I said flatly.  
  
It did not really dawn on me that I misunderstood exactly what was being asked, because all three women started to laugh.  
  
“I mean are you willing to do them Mr. Kyong?” She was still chuckling, it was a much nicer atmosphere and I allowed myself a soft smile.  
  
“Gabriel.”  
  
“Pardon?” She looked genuinely confused.  
  
“If you are going to be working with me, my name is Gabriel, or Gabe. I am not likely to respond to my surname out of the blue.” I looked down at the Mug. “And I will go on a case by case basis for what public appearances I am willing to make.”  
  
“Great\\\~. That makes you more willing than many of the others. Moving on quickly. We need to pick a name. Your power relies on fluid motion so… how about Dancer?” She sounded chipper now.  
  
“No.”  
  
It was all I could offer as I think if I tried to put in more words than that some of them would have been curses. There were more chuckles from the other two. Though Madischild did not seem to get it.  
  
“Dancers move fluidly, and dancing is a rather respected career that tends to be male dominated on the top end. It could be inspirational to young men across the world.” Her tone was diplomatic, and it was an enviable attempt.  
  
“No.” I said a bit more firmly.  
  
How she puffed her cheeks was cute. She made a note in her book.  
  
“Ideally we would want something we could market Gabriel. Something along the lines of your power or appearance or public persona.” She said, steeping her fingers.  
  
“The public has named him Druid or Oni depending on the circles.” Echo sounded like she was genuinely trying to be helpful.  
  
Emily gave her a stern look. “Both of those have derogatory connotations that would not get past most of our public channels. Oni is a demon and is an insult based on the horns and eyes his powers gave him. Druids are male only magic users from northern Europe and current politics would call it a harmful stereotype.”  
  
“Also the video floating about would make it an issue if he was still called Druid.” Pantheon added.  
  
“Video?” I did not recall making any video. Had someone recorded the fight?  
  
“Matriarch released the apology video on your fan sites the day you made it. We’ve been doing damage control since. Some of the sites removed them, but we are aware that what is on the internet is forever. We’ve only managed to keep them off the largest platforms.” Madischild sounded exasperated at that.  
  
“Ah.” I shrugged at that. The coffee would have gone well with something savory to balance it out, like pizza.  
  
“’Ah’? It’s pretty much shredding your public image, and it makes it look like you agree with letting villains rule the streets.” She sighed and rubbed her eyes. “I can understand being afraid, but I wish you would have considered your public image a few days ago. The guardians could have protected you.”  
  
“At the time it was an expedient solution to solve a few issues. I told her what she wanted to hear to make a problem go away. I didn’t need or want your protection.” I could not express how little interest I had in where this conversation was going.  
  
“It still causes us a number of problems with you signing up so soon after. It will make the public uneasy about either your level of power that you could be made to do that, or your integrity if it comes out that you did it willingly.” She huffed at that.  
  
“Then spin the story that the apology was not enough. I was outnumbered by their number of Meta humans which is technically true, and that I am here seeking protection and training.” My active disinterest was showing in my features at this point.  
  
“I may have to work with that. I will tell you if I come up with a better story.” She was curt about it.  
  
A silence lingered on as she turned in her chair to look at Echo. It seemed the pair were doing like Pantheon and Echo had earlier. It made me wonder if they had a way to talk that I could not see, and that my power could not detect.  
  
The timing was too perfect. No one was paying attention to me, Madischild was looking at Echo and drinking her tea.  
  
“Why not name me Ogre?” I spoke in a loud enough voice that she would not mishear me.  
  
Echo was wearing the tea now, and Emily was choking and coughing. I felt a bit of satisfaction at that one. Emily turned her back to me fully as she had to spit out what tea was left in her mouth out into her cup so she could continue coughing.  
  
Pantheon laughed louder than I heard the entire day. She turned away from me and had bit down on her fist to stifle it, which had little effect. She knew me, and she knew the timing was deliberate. I used to do similar things to people when I was younger and she had caught it once or twice before.  
  
“W-what?” Madischild managed through coughs. She did not turn back to face me.  
  
“Ogres are a European myth. Some portrayals have them with horns like mine, Most give them my black sclera.” I could not keep the amusement out of my voice, even with how hard I was trying. I found a strange satisfaction in the look the now wet echo was giving me and Emily.  
  
“Absolutely not.” She had mostly gotten control of her breathing again, and she almost sounded panicked. “We are not naming you after an ugly monster that eats people!”  
  
I could not help but chuckle at that. I almost felt bad for Emily. At that moment I decided that her being panicked like this was cute. That meant I would probably end up trying to see this side of her more often, consciously or not.  
  
“Well we have to come up with something.” I grinned, I could not help it.  
  
“Drifter.” Pantheon offered, having recovered from her laughing fit. It was something that caught my interest and drew my and Emily’s attention. Echo was still glaring at me. “’Drifting is a term in dancing, and it refers to something that happens around momentum in racing and other things. So it hints at his power and you get to call him a dancer without being so blatant about it.”  
  
“That is acceptable. I could see that.” Emily added.  
  
I thought it over. I did not like being themed around dancing, but Drifter had a lot of connotations in a lot of ways. It could be a dancer, it could be a person that moves from place to place, it could be a racer. It worked. After a pregnant pause I decided.

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female  
- Straight
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size
- Pleasing to the eyes (your mileage may vary, but so far the reviews are good 😏)

By day, I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning). By night and during my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from FullyBooked.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and walking around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie. I’m also a sucker for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, cafe hopping, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely. 💯 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my playful and adventurous side.

What I’m looking for…
A guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endlessly thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you:
- Are well-groomed, carry yourself confidently 
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- Preferably you’re in Cebu City / Mandaue City (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives), but I’m open to LDR if everything clicks.

If this sounds like you…
Send me a DM and tell me: 
- About yourself AND 
- Your go-to coffee order OR
- Your dream road trip destination OR
- The last book you couldn’t put down

I promise I don’t bite… unless you’re holding the last slice of cheesecake! 😚

but leave me scrolling memes on the toilet throne?

I get sick just writing that. I met him when I was 14, and he was 49. I grew up in a bad family situation (1 of 9 kids, home schooled on a rural farm, ultra conservative Reformed Presbyterian cult, abusive father who m0le$ted me) and looking back the situation was ripe. I didn’t have a single friend, I was desperately lonely, the abuse was ongoing and finally someone gave me attention. When I was 15 he’d told me he loved me, at 16 he was already calling me his wife, saying he was going to marry me, and was kissing me/touching me. To me there was never any question I would marry him. He kept it in his pants until 2 weeks after my 18th birthday.

We got engaged, moved in together, got married when I was 21, bought a house on a lake, adopted a cat and a rabbit. I was working a good job, started my own business. I was financially stable and I contributed 50% of the bills. I paid entirely for our vacations. I took us to Mexico, France, Ireland. I planned and designed a beautiful cut flower and vegetable garden, it was my baby. I loved it. After years of dreaming I got to have the garden I always wanted. I’d wake up in the mornings, fix a cup of coffee, take my cat outside for a walk, and harvest basket fulls of flowers and vegetables. I learned how to can and pickle, I made sourdough. I cooked 4 nights a week. I never had much growing up, but I finally had a place to call my own. But I wasn’t happy. The marriage wasn’t going well. I felt like I couldn’t do anything right. I had trauma blocked so much from my memory. After years of therapy and healing the trauma from my father I guess the Universe said it was time to deal with the trauma from my husband. I started questioning his motives. Little memories started coming back at random. I’d remember something, and it wouldn’t sit well with me. I couldn’t get it out of my head. And then I found my journals from when I was 14-18 and it all blew to hell.

I read two pages and was on the verge of throwing up. I couldn’t stop reading. My body started shaking and didn’t stop for 48 hours. I kept running to the bathroom dry heaving. I couldn’t look him in the face. That night we had a 2 hour argument. I stood up to him. I called him a groomer. I said he took advantage of me. He threatened to kill himself if I left. I left the next morning with just some clothes in a backpack. He stalked me the next day. I could’ve run away, but I wasn’t done yet. I was angry. I confronted him again. He kept defending himself, he loved me, he knew I had a bad family, he wanted to give me a better life. “I was a child” I kept saying. “I didn’t see you as a child.” He said. And that was all I needed to hear, I got in my car and drove away.

He went psycho on me, changed the locks on my own house. Accused me of cheating, abandoning him. Said he had canceled my phone and car insurance. I got a protection order, and I had to break into my house to get my belongings and my kitty. I haven’t looked back, I don’t miss him - I just miss the life I had.

That was 15 months ago and I’m struggling. I’ve had four jobs in that time, currently working 3; moved three times; my car was totaled because of reckless driver and I couldn’t get a car loan to get a new one because of the mortgage on my credit; I’m constantly stressed about money and the future. My friends were so supportive when I left and now only two really check in. I don’t have any family, I went no contact years ago. Mostly, I miss my gardens and my beautiful flowers. I had a gorgeous collection of plants and some were highly coveted. I think about them every day. I miss having structure in my life. I miss the stability of what I had. Instead I’m in a state of constant overwhelm, depression, loneliness, and stress. The divorce is in process but he’s not cooperating so that’s making things challenging. I have a good lawyer who understands trauma and is helping me take him to the cleaners. I have two therapists who have been by my side.

Today would’ve been my 6th anniversary. I miss my old life and I wish I would wake up from this nightmare.",58,1755346848.0,TrueOffMyChest,11,0.9,False

Laps? Taken. Shoulders? Occupied. Your head pillow at 2 a.m.? Prime real estate.

And in my house, mornings don’t begin with an alarm clock - they begin with the plan. Kona, Nessie, and CJ have perfected their morning strategy to ensure I’m up exactly when they want: feeding time.

Kona starts the operation by settling next to my head, purring like a tiny motor until I pet her. Nessie goes covert - scaling furniture, prying open drawers, or finding something that makes that infuriating-yet-effective crackle noise that guarantees my eyes pop open. CJ? He’s the muscle of the team. With the precision of a furry missile, he launches onto the bed and lands squarely on my legs, jolting me into consciousness. It’s coordinated. It’s relentless. And it works. Every. Single. Time.

CJ, Kona, and Nessie have turned me into their full-service luxury mattress - complete with warmth, heartbeat, and occasional snack service. Whether I’m working at my desk, binge-watching TV, or just sitting there minding my own business, my body is apparently the place to be.

But here’s the thing - this clinginess is more than just an adorable quirk. Pets want to be close to us because we’re their safe place. Our scent, our warmth, our heartbeat - it all says, “You belong here. You’re loved. You’re home.”

Sure, sometimes I lose feeling in my legs or have to perform Olympic-level stretches to grab my coffee without disturbing a single whisker. But honestly? I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Because when they choose me as their spot, they’re not just looking for comfort - they’re telling me that in their world, I’m home.

Pet Logic 101: The Official Rules of Human Ownership

If I fits, I sits. This includes laps, shoulders, laptops, and anything you thought was yours.

You’re warm, so you’re mine. Especially if you looked comfortable without me.

Bathroom time = group activity. Oh, you thought you’d go alone? Adorable.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Do a Handstand*

---

### Parse the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem

Let’s start with the numbers, because even in Sweden’s Superettan, the laws of probability are non-negotiable.

**Helsingborgs IF**, the favorites, are priced between **1.91 (Bovada)** and **2.05 (FanDuel)**, translating to an implied **48.78%–52.36% chance to win**. That’s the statistical equivalent of a “meh” — not thrilling, but reliable as a coffee machine in Stockholm.

**Falkenbergs FF**, the underdogs, hover around **3.2–3.65**, implying a **27.78%–31.25% chance**. Not great odds, but hey, underdogs live in the hope department, and hope is *incredibly* cheap at this price point.

The **draw**? Also priced between **3.5–3.9**, meaning bookmakers expect a **25.64%–33.33% chance of a stalemate**. Given the spread markets (Helsingborgs -0.5 at **1.8–1.99**), the bookies are basically saying: *“Helsingborgs should win, but not by much — unless Falkenbergs trip over their own shoelaces.”*

The **totals market** is screaming **OVER 2.5 goals** at **1.76–1.93**, implying a **51.28%–56.82% chance of a high-scoring thriller**. If you’re betting on this, imagine a game where players shoot as if the goal’s the size of a trampoline.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Acrobatics, and One Very Confused Water Bottle

Let’s unpack the drama off the pitch:

* **Helsingborgs IF** has their star striker, **Erik “The Swedish Meteor” Johansson**, back from a **two-game suspension** for… *tripping over a water bottle during a press conference*. Yes, really. The man’s so clumsy, he once scored a hat trick against his own team in a pickup game. But with him back, their attack is like a well-oiled meatball factory — efficient, slightly greasy, and impossible to resist.
* **Falkenbergs FF** is dealing with a **crippling defense**. Their best cente

I recently attended 4 Alliance Française classes (A1.1 level) and have been struggling a lot. I have ADHD and have been struggling to focus in class, plus have had RSV for the last 2 weeks so have been sick and have not attended the classes. 

My teacher is lovely but I find that her teaching style doesn’t resonate with me. In French (cannot speak much English) she goes over stuff in depth (I think?) and then calls you out to say it in front of everyone (the class has 15 people). I feel quite put on the spot to be honest and the energy feels as though I am more pressured to get it right than learn. And as someone with ADHD, I forget everything quite fast plus anxiety. 

I know a few people in my class said during break that they found the class too fast pace for A1.1. 

I haven’t actually learned much as a lot of the info is unclear and I try asking but she can’t understand. I think I might want to leave the class and just focus on French on my own. But.. I don’t quite know where to start for this. 

I tend to be focussing on my performance when being called out over learning them long-term… I feel it has caused more stress and nerves over enthusiasm for learning.

Now to give you a context, she is from an EXTREMELY wealthy family. I am talking about hundreds of crores per annum. As a person, I am not very fond of her. She is very loud, tone is extremely rude and is very obsessed with money and specially family money. First few times when we went out, me and my husband we both felt she is not a nice person. Idk even if she is we don’t like her behaviour and topics of discussion for sure. 

Right now, she is unemployed. But her lifestyle is lavish, ofc she comes from a rich bg. I too was unemployed but recently bagged a very good job with a good hike. I had my first week of office last week. 

From the moment we entered their house (it’s their new apartment and we went with housewarming gifts as well) she started pinching me about my new job in different ways. For ex: how I am gonna get tired of my job really soon, how our household income is now gonna be high etc etc.

I ignored most of the comments by saying nothing or just smiling. We sat at their place for like 5 mins (it’s their new apartment and we went with housewarming gifts), they didn’t even ask for a glass of water or coffee. So we went out and she is still talking about my job. I shared my concern that I have to apply for my leaves in December cause their wedding is coming and how I am scared as a new joinee. She went on about how now I am gonna “act all corporate” now because I have a job now. Still didn’t say anything. After sometime we were discussing about how auto/cabs etc are becoming expensive and how they don’t even turn on the AC anymore. That’s when I shared how lucky I am that my office is providing cabs and they are very clean and I feel like cleaning my shoes before sitting on my cab and everyone laughed. 

That’s when it comes. She made a face and a mocking face and said “Oho madam is now all about office office office office office” she repeated the word office like a million times by making an ugly mocking face. And that’s when it striked me and felt like a punch in my gut. I decided to go to her level and counterpunch. I said “yes I am gonna make it my personality now and if unemployed people have problems with it idk what to do” and I laughed and so did everyone else. She made a face and decided to move on.

I know I did a bad thing and my husband was “correcting me” the whole time on our way back home. But I am so pissed. She as a 32 yo can fight with a 26yo about having a job and somehow I need to be a bigger person?? It’s her choice to not find a job till another one year and somehow she is all jealous and acting petty because I got a job now? Isn’t not having a job her CHOICE? And somehow she can’t own it up? I HATE how I reacted and there was no difference between her and me. But I am pretty sure I am more angry at my partner for trying to teach me manners instead of backing me up there. NO I DON’T WANT TO BE THE BIGGER PERSON ALL THE TIME fuck it. Rant over.",91,1755346469.0,TwoXIndia,34,0.94,False
