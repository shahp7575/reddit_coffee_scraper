1kuqjif,https://www.reddit.com/r/medlabprofessionals/comments/1kuqjif/night_shift_lifea_timeline/,Night shift life—a timeline,"1745 - alarm goes off. 

1820 - like for real, I gotta get out of bed or I’ll be late again. 

1825 - having slept five additional minutes, I race to the shower, thinking if I can shower in 3 minutes, I can make some food while my hair dries and I air fluff the wrinkles out of laundry that just lives in the dryer. 

1847 - the hot shower felt good. Too good. No regrets. Check the time—okay, some regrets. 

1855 - hurl whatever leftovers or snacks into a bag for lunch, ignoring the bag of spinach and carrot sticks I optimistically bought to meal prep.  These items more closely resemble algae than vegetables at this point. Oh well. Dinner today appears to be a jar of pickles, some chocolate covered almonds, and leftover Mexican takeout, plus 3 5-hour energy shots. 

1910 - 15 minutes literally disappeared. I’m flying out of the house like it’s on fire. 

1957 - I’ve spent the past 47 minutes mentally slandering every other driver on the road. It’s almost 8pm and somehow traffic still makes me despise my fellow man. Tires screech as I fly into the parking garage and fumble for my badge. It falls between the seats…again. People behind me honk like they always do. They’re late too. 

2002 - clock in. Late. Again. Technically I’m within that 5 minute grace period, but damn. 

2015 - listen as evening shift regales me with tales of service calls and lost specimens, and how their life is going, like we didn’t just see each other yesterday. Spend the next three hours fantasizing about the shift being over and going home and going to bed. 

2315 - go to lunch. Discover the Mexican takeout is walking a fine line between nutrition and food poisoning. Scarf it down because if I end up peeing out of my butt, maybe I can call out tomorrow. If I’m lucky. 

2345 - return from break to discover the person covering my bench is drowning under the workload. It is now my turn to drown while they go to break. Question my life choices as I button my lab coat and pull on my hand condoms.

0001 - midnight tasks and chores, baby! Today is a new day!

0015 - &$!#ing maintenance and QC. What fresh hell awaits tonight? New lot new shipment with no calibration? Catastrophic mechanical failure on the analyzer? 

0330 - morning run starts. Why they gotta poke these people between the hours of last call and the opening of donut shops? Slog through hundreds more specimens in 3 hours than dayshift sees on their whole shift. By myself. Wait for dayshift to arrive. 

0618 - dayshift rolls in late with coffee and donuts (carefully labeling these shareable treats as treats exclusively for the consumption of dayshift) and provides facial expressions that suggest they believe I’ve done nothing but TikTok videos all night because there are still racks of specimens awaiting testing while I finish troubleshooting failed QC and calling the same nurses to tell them the fourth green top they sent is just as hemolyzed as the others. Finally get a 15 minute break, 14 minutes before my shift ends. 

0632 - clock out. Stare listlessly at morning traffic and ponder whether freedom under capitalism is just slavery under another name. Swear I’ll go to bed right when I get home. 

0724 - get home. Kick off shoes. Slump onto the couch. Turn on Netflix. Listen to a stupid show while scrolling Reddit and reading the news. Suddenly not tired and desperate to enjoy free time. 

1232 - pass out on the couch. 

1328 - wake up to missionaries asking if I want to let Jesus into my heart. 

1330 - go to bed. 

1445 - wake up to the landscaping crew at my apartment weed eating the shrubs outside my bedroom window. 

1550 - wake up to neighborhood kids screaming as they get off the bus from school. 

1745 - alarm goes off. ",1,1748134976.0,medlabprofessionals,0,1.0,False

1kuqipt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kuqipt,Review: Laphroaig James McGregor's 2005 Single Cask (released for Feis Ile 2023),"**Distillery:** Laphroaig

**Age Statement:** 18 years (distilled 2005, released 2023)

**ABV:** 54.5%

**Color:** Green ... just kidding, [1.3 (russet)](https://maltrunners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cil8ins.jpeg)

**Cask type:** Single cask; 8 years in a first-fill bourbon cask, then 10 years in an Amontillado sherry butt

**Price:** £400

Two years ago, my wife and I were lucky enough to attend Feis Ile for the second time. Our favorite distilleries are Lagavulin and Laphroaig, respectively, so it was an auspicious week for us to try some rare drams and soak in the atmosphere of Islay. It is one of the loveliest places in Scotland and perhaps the world (trip recaps for our Lagavulin and Laphroaig visits are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/13tel3a/feis_ile_2023_lagavulin_day_recap_527/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/13vwufr/feis_ile_2023_day_four_laphroaig_day_recap_530/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/13yj30e/feis_ile_2023_day_seven_recap_62/)). Best of all, the sun shone on us almost the entire trip, making it a pleasure to spend our days outdoors. Right outside of Laphroaig’s legendary Warehouse 1, I even got to skip some stones across the broad bay that gives the distillery its name.

Midway through Laphroaig’s open day, whispers started spreading that the distillery planned to release a single-cask offering, which was an exciting and unexpected development. Unlike Bruichladdich or Bunnahabhain, Laphroaig usually releases only one bottle to commemorate the festival, the hotly anticipated Cairdeas (“friendship”) expression. In 2023, however, they switched things up because James McGregor, one of the warehousemen, was retiring after working for the distillery for an astounding 47 years.

To send James off in style, Laphroaig asked him to choose a particularly fine single cask to celebrate his retirement (and I hope he got to keep the proceeds!). He plucked this double-matured cask out of the warehouses that he faithfully roamed for decades, and the patient visitors’ center staff used Sharpies to write numbers on our hands to reserve our chance to buy a bottle. Toward the end of the day, as we queued up for our prize, a group of warehousemen including James performed his symbolic final act. Together, they rolled a barrel from the top of the hill down to Warehouse 1, while the entire crowd cheered and clapped for James’s long service to the place we so dearly love. Truly a memory I’ll never forget.

My wife and I held onto this bottle for a year before opening it on our wedding anniversary in 2024. And now, a year later and just a few days before Laphroaig’s 2025 open day this Tuesday, I think it’s time to review this singular dram. As a comparison, I’m tasting it alongside a 2010s-era Laphroaig 18 of the same age.

**Nose:** McGregor’s Cask starts off with a lovely and unusually sweet dollop of vanilla, caramel, and cinnamon-dusted apples. This is not your typical Laphroaig thanks to that long double maturation and, even though Amontillado is a fairly dry sherry, its richer and nuttier notes combine with the fruitiness of Laphroaig’s teenage spirit beautifully. Like many older Laphroaigs, the distillery’s signature medicinality and rubbery peat are still present but are no longer white-knuckling the steering wheel. The smoke is very subdued, more reminiscent of a honey barbecue, and there’s a strong base layer of amber, fresh leather, and musk.

**Palate:** The first sip is a little reminder that this is still a Laphroaig, as iodine and sea-spray coat the tongue before a creamy sweetness takes over. There’s more citrus in the palate than the nose let on. Syrupy tangerines, caramel, tobacco, earthy peatiness, and a bit of spice. Years ago, the 2014 Cairdeas, which featured an Amontillado finish, also had similar orchard fruit and caramel flavors. So at least in my experience, Amontillado casks add quite a bit of sweetness to Laphroaig’s distillate. In comparison, the 2010s-era 18-year-old is loads more medicinal, has more tropical fruit, and expresses the core distillery character more clearly.

**Finish:**  Dark chocolate and coffee are some of my favorite flavors in whisky, and McGregor’s Cask is all candied orange peel, dark chocolate, and black coffee, with wisps of smoke and vegetal peat. On subsequent sips, it gets a bit meatier, almost like a Christmas honey-glazed ham.

**Conclusion:** I’m a diehard Laphroaig fan, so it almost isn’t fair to ask me to score this dram. Of course, I love it. That said, having tried a lot of Laphroaigs helps to place this single cask in context. For people who like the classic, ex-bourbon Laphroaig character–think the 10 Cask Strength, Cairdeas Warehouse 1, or classics like the 18 and (some editions of) 25–this dram may be a hint too saccharine. For those who prefer the “sweet-and-peat” side of the house, though, like PX Cask, Triple Wood, or the many sherry- or port-finished Cairdeas expressions, this single cask should be a massive hit. It’s basically a big brother to those stellar whiskies, with added depth and texture. This is superb whisky, as reflected in my score–although, if I had to take value into account, the gobsmacking price might knock it down a peg.

1kuq7yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1kuq7yn/quieting_that_judgmental_feeling_while_advocating/,Quieting that judgmental feeling while advocating for yourself,"Was on Adderall (10 mg/2x a day) and was supplementing with coffee for the dosage needing to be slightly increased— but was in the middle of moving. The adderall worked well other than it felt like I was needing more and more coffee to keep me at that calm/focused level, but coffee also made me have more and more anxiety spiking at night once the meds were out of me. 
I had heard positive things about Vyvanse and thought it may be good to switch to a slow release med and see if anxiety at the end of the night wouldn’t happen with it and I was going to a new dr and had been off my adderall for a couple months (which has caused massive chaos with the move— I feel like I am floating in time blindness, no systems are in place anywhere, etc). 
So I started vyvanse at 10 mg. Nothing. Might as well have taken a sugar pill.  I called my nurse after three days on it? She said she would talk to the dr but I hadn’t really given it a chance. I had also mentioned that I actually felt worse than when I am on nothing because I was not drinking much coffee till I knew how I reacted on it and she made it seem like that was pointless. So a couple days later, the nurse called back with a 20 mg prescription. I have been on it a week or so. The only difference I feel is about 30 mins to an hour after I feel really impatient for an hour or so. Like everything is taking too long. I have actually been getting showers at lunch now because the impatience hitting in the shower is really frustrating and I start skipping self care stuff like lotion or adding oil to my hair before the shower. But then it just goes away and I am sitting with my normal self for the most part. I also feel like I have less resolve to not click on TikTok or social media. 

Question: I feel like it’s too early to say yes or no for this being a good fit for me— or am I wrong and this is looking like I just need to drop back to adderall? It seems like starting dose for this stuff is 30 mg and I am not even there yet. Also, how do I advocate for myself as far as stimulate meds and not feel like a drug seeker? I did years of therapy and actually had a lot of systems set up to help me that weren’t med related, but our move out of state has taken every single system away. I am drowning and need my brain to get it together to start setting stuff up here for me now. So this slowly starting meds stuff is extra frustrating. I am a little stressed about calling the nurse again since it’s only been a week, but adderall worked the 2nd day (1st day the dr had me split the pill into 5mg just to make sure we kind of tried a little bit first).  I thought that Vyvanse being a stimulate would make the process a little faster on upping or lowering dosages for what I need. ",1,1748133895.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1kuq6kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kuq6kg/my_bf_cheated_on_me_so_i_slept_with_his_brother/,My bf cheated on me so I slept with his brother,"I, 19M have been dating this guy called Ivan for around four months. We know each other since we were little kids, so we know everything about each other. Or so I thought.

Ivan was never the most affectionate guy, but we would have our own ways of showing love. For example, I love cooking, so we always cook together, we like to send each other brainrot memes too. But, a while ago, Ivan has become overly protective of his phone, won’t kiss me or hug me and will only touch me if it’s for sex. It got me wondering if I did something wrong. 

One day, after having sex, I went to hug him, but he said he was “too tired for my clingy bullshit”. I should’ve realized by then that this was a red flag. I sighed and asked if I had done something to upset him, and he just said that it’s college taking its toll on him. Whatever.

The next day, as he showered, I grabbed his phone and unlocked it. I started to look through things and found a surprising amount of nudes. Even of his ex. He was sending dick pictures to a bunch of guys, his searching history had some weird ass stuff and he even had bought some… interesting “dominant alpha male” stuff. To say I was shocked was an understatement. I never thought Ivan was capable of doing that, especially after knowing him for so long. 

I sighed, took prints, sent it to myself and then deleted it from his phone. I stayed quiet. I wanted to scream and throw the damn phone on his face, but I knew better that he wouldn’t listen to me even if I cried my heart out. 

After he got out of the shower, he stared me up and down, saying nothing. I asked him if there was something up with him, but he shrugged and said “I’m just tired from college”. He doesn’t even try to study, by the way. I got up and went to college alone, considering he skipped again because “the headache is killing me”, he said. 

On my way to college, I bumped into his brother, Lev. He’s in his last year of medicine in the same college me and Ivan go. He said hi and offered me a ride. I said yes. When I got in, he asked why Ivan wasn’t coming, and I couldn’t resist myself. I started to cry and ended up telling him everything. He seemed furious. But he hugged me and told me that no brother of his would ever be a lazy cheater. At this point, we had already missed the first class. So, instead of going to college, he took me to my favorite coffee shop. We ate cookies and drank coffee as we talked about random things. Turns out me and Lev had more in common than I thought.

The next few days, me and Lev texted nonstop. Ivan would always excuse himself, saying he “had to work” (he doesn’t work). I knew he was going to go cheat on me, but at this point, I felt numb. The betrayal was so big that my heart started to feel numbness. Lev was helping me through it all, so, in a way, it didn’t hurt as badly as it would if I was completely alone. 

Slowly, as Ivan cheated more and more, and became more verbal and physical, Lev and me became closer and closer. The hole in my heart slowly started to fill. It sounds too quick, I know, and I felt guilty, but I loved the way Lev made me feel. 

So, one day, it happened. I went over to Lev’s house to watch the Karate kid movie and let’s just say he showed me what Karate feels like with a big third leg. 

After all of Ivan’s bullshit, I made my final move. I decided to make a dinner, inviting our friends and Lev too. Ivan, as always, kept bragging about how he settled down for me, how he studied, dated and worked at the same time and blah blah blah. In the midst of his self praise, I make an announcement. I ask for everyone’s attention and say: “guys, since Ivan has made so much accomplishments, I must show you guys his most recent one.” Then, in our TV, the prints, videos and conversations of him and random boys start showing. Everyone’s jaws drop, especially at the pictures of my bruised face and waist (caused by him). 

As he starts getting insults from our friends, he tries to defend himself by saying that I didn’t complain when taking his ahem, shaboink. He insulted me a bit more. I had enough and said “well, at least your brother doesn’t need ten rounds to make me come.” His jaw dropped and he screamed: “YOU SLEPT WITH MY OWN BROTHER?! YOU TRAITOR!” I just chuckle and said that this was rich coming from him. Then both me and Lev walked off. 

Now, this has been two weeks. Me and Lev are taking things more slow, but I’m 100% sure that I love him. And at least he isn’t aggressive or rude towards me. 

Ivan keeps blowing my phone, but I just blocked him. I feel good about what I did, but I wonder if I went too much. ",0,1748133768.0,AITAH,11,0.36,False

Any thoughts or advice on this?,"Problem/Goal: Her behavior towards me so far post rejection vibes is very inconsistent

Context: Hi. 30M here and 33F siya. We are just acquaintances and we serve in the same ministry team

On April 2024, I asked her out for a coffee date then she just game me a vague response for the asked out. No clarity on where she stands by that time, so I decided to asked her out for the 2nd time July 2024, but she just read the chat message and did not respond back. On September 21, 2024, I had the opportunity for a clarity talk with her to know she stands. Sadly, she told me that she is not interested and yeah, I got rejected by her and on my invitation on asking her out for a coffee date

So post rejection vibes last year 2024 up until recently, very inconsistent ung behavior niya towards me. I respected her decision and I truly believe I did not cross any boundaries so far. But yeah, I just do not understand on why her behavior towards me post rejection is very inconsistent

Do you guys have any thoughts, opinions, or ideas on why do you think her behavior so far after post rejection, is very inconsistent towards me?

Kasi pala there are some times if magkita kami in person, friendly naman siya and overall maganda naman ung response niya and facial expression niya saakin

Then there are some times na cold siya, avoidant, distant and ignore niya ako. Then there are some times na parang awkward siya saakin and hindi parin sya comfortable saakin

Hindi ko lang gets kung bakit ganito ung behavior niya saakin post rejection, very inconsistent siya saakin

Any thoughts, opinions, or advice on this? Thanks!

1kuq4n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/spinalfusion/comments/1kuq4n4/minor_auto_accident_almost_3_years_post_op/,Minor auto accident - almost 3 years post op,"Hey everyone! 

This post is more about venting worries/seeking advice if others can relate. I want to start by saying that I know only a medical professional can evaluate me - and I am waiting for my insurance agent to call me back and let me know if the initial visit to my doctor’s office would be covered (it’s Saturday evening, so I know he’ll call me Tuesday since Monday is a holiday :) ) and that if anything feels worse I will go to Immediate care or a similar place of care. 

So today while waiting in a drive thru to get coffee, I was rear ended. My car was parked - and I am unsure if the person behind me just got “too close” while approaching my car; or if their car was parked, then put in drive, and rear ended me?
That being said - the other car rear ended me at a relatively low speed (somewhere between 1-15 MPH) - but I’m just worried.

I had my fusion L5-S1 in July of 2022, so coming up on 3 years. I had no complications or issues post op (in terms of lingering pain, residual pain, etc). But I’m worried about this. Has anyone else had any similar occurrences? After the accident, it was deemed neither of us needed emergent or immediate medical attention. But about 10 hours later, I’m feeling an aching pain in my lower back. This is the first “accident” or “incident” I have had since my fusion, and I’m just worried that it could mess something up. 

Any stories (whether encouraging or ‘informative’ so-to-speak) are welcome.

Thanks so much!

1kuq1wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Facade/comments/1kuq1wu/a_ridiculous_conversation_with_chatgpt/,A ridiculous conversation with ChatGPT,"This was a Facade bot for ChatGPT, this is how it went...

**You said:**

**Begin. Name: ""ResponsibleAd""**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: A sleek Manhattan apartment. The soft hum of jazz plays under dim golden lighting. You're standing just outside the door, which swings open as Tripp greets you with a wide, practiced smile. Grace follows just behind, a little too quickly, adjusting her blouse like she had been mid-argument. The air between them is taut, though both are trying hard to pretend otherwise.\]

Tripp: ResponsibleAd! Wow, it's so great to see you—come in, come in! We were just saying how nice it’ll be to have a guest tonight, weren’t we, Grace?

Grace: Yes, we were. It’s not often we get a break from our little routine. Please, make yourself at home.

\*\[Tripp steps aside, gesturing broadly into the warm, modern interior. Grace closes the door behind you, a little too firmly. There’s a tension behind her polite smile, something buried just beneath the surface.\]

What do you want to do or say, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Say: Hi, great to see you guys again.**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: You step inside, your shoes clicking softly against the polished wood floor. The apartment smells faintly of rosemary and lemon—something’s been cooking. Tripp claps a hand on your shoulder with slightly too much enthusiasm, while Grace gives you a brief but genuine smile before glancing toward the kitchen.\]

Tripp: Great to see you too, ResponsibleAd. It’s been way too long—we’ve missed having someone around who actually knows how to hold a conversation.

Grace: Some people would say I do that just fine. But yes, we’ve missed you. Come, sit at the island while I finish up.

\[She turns toward the open-concept kitchen, hips a little stiff. Tripp casually guides you to a sleek stool at the marble-topped island, then leans against the counter, watching Grace for a moment too long.\]

What do you want to do or say, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Do: Notice the tension between the two and chose to ask courteously. Say: Is everything okay? We can reschedule if you guys need space.**

ChatGPT said:

\*\[Scene: You ease into the stool, the chill of the marble counter sharp against your forearms. Tripp lets out a quick laugh—too quick—while Grace freezes mid-stir at the stove. A wooden spoon lingers in the air as she exhales slowly through her nose.\]

Tripp: What? No—no, come on, ResponsibleAd, don’t be ridiculous. We’re fine. Aren’t we, Grace?

Grace: Perfectly fine. Just the usual married couple things. You know how it is. Unless… you think we need space, Tripp?

\[She doesn’t turn around, but the tone in her voice is tight as piano wire. Tripp runs a hand through his hair and shrugs, suddenly fascinated by the wine rack beside the fridge.\]

Tripp: I’ll get us some wine. That’s still your thing, right, ResponsibleAd?

What do you want to do or say, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Say: Ah yes, a nice glass of Merlot will set the evening off nicely, and let's not forget the small celebration, this marks 10 years since I introduced you to Grace, senior year of college. Remember that?**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: Tripp pauses with his hand on the wine bottle, his eyes narrowing just slightly. Grace turns then—slowly—wooden spoon in hand, her eyebrows lifted in a mixture of surprise and something else. Something cooler.\]

Tripp: Ten years, huh? God, that makes me feel ancient. And yeah, I remember. You practically threw her at me, ResponsibleAd.

Grace: Threw is generous. I think I was just bored enough at the time to say yes to a drink.

\*\[She smiles thinly and returns to stirring the sauce, but the tension now is sharper, like glass underfoot. Tripp uncorks the Merlot with a little more force than necessary. The cork pops with a loud thwack.\]

Tripp: Here’s to old friends, then—and older stories that never quite line up the same way, huh?

\[He starts pouring the wine into three large glasses, the dark red swirling like ink. He hands you one first, then Grace, then raises his own.\]

What do you want to do or say, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Do: Take several sips of wine, yummy. Do: Point to the picture of the Italian Countryside Tripp took on a recent Vacation with Grace. Say: Tell me about this photograph, Trip.**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: You take a few generous sips of the Merlot—it’s full-bodied, rich, and velvety, with just enough edge to it. Grace eyes your glass approvingly, while Tripp seems relieved to have the focus shifted. You point to the large framed photo on the wall—an expansive shot of rolling Tuscan hills under a pale morning sky. Tripp's expression flickers, half-pride, half something unreadable.\]

Tripp: Ah, that. Yeah. That was Cortona… or maybe Chianti? It kind of all blurred together after the third vineyard, right, Grace?

Grace: It was Chianti. You said it was too “quaint” to stay more than one night. But the light was good, so—of course—you had to take the shot.

\[She says it softly, but with a trace of coolness. Tripp lets out a half-laugh, swirling his wine. He doesn’t look at her.\]

Tripp: The shot was good. Not everything has to be a four-hour meal and a wine buzz, Grace.

Grace: Some of us enjoy sitting still once in a while. But I forget—you married the scenery, not the experience.

\[The silence after that is immediate and uncomfortable. The jazz still plays faintly in the background, now oddly misplaced.\]

What do you want to do or say, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Say: The picture reminds me of romance. Was that what you had in mind?**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: The wine sits warm in your hand as you speak, your voice careful. Tripp looks at the photo again, but doesn’t answer immediately. Grace sets down the spoon a bit harder than necessary, the clink against the pot loud in the still air.\]

Tripp: Romance? Sure. I mean, I guess that’s one way to frame it. It looked romantic. From a distance.

Grace: From a distance, most things do.

\[She moves toward the island, sliding a small dish of olives and almonds in front of you, her smile a little too gracious now. Tripp watches her, saying nothing. Then he takes a long drink of his wine.\]

Tripp: Anyway. Let’s not turn every picture into a metaphor. Sometimes a hill’s just a hill, right?

Grace: Unless it’s one you keep dying on.

\*\[There’s a pulse of silence again, and then Grace laughs—quick, dismissive—and returns to the kitchen to check on the oven.\]

What do you want to do or say, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Do: Point to another painting on the opposite wall**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: You shift your gaze, subtly directing the energy elsewhere as you point toward the opposite wall. Hanging there is a large, abstract painting—bold slashes of red, black, and pale gold layered in chaotic, deliberate motion. The piece feels loud, even in the quiet room. Tripp follows your gesture and chuckles, a little too dryly.\]

Tripp: Ah, that one. Grace bought it at some gallery opening last spring. Said it reminded her of us.

Grace: I said it reminded me of conflict, not us. But maybe that’s the same thing now.

\[She doesn't look at Tripp as she speaks, bending to peek inside the oven. The heat wafts out, and something that smells like roasted lemon and garlic rises with it.\]

Tripp: Well, that’s just what every husband wants on his wall. A reminder that he’s been turned into brushstrokes by a woman who critiques his posture over dinner.

Grace: Only when you're slouching.

\[You feel the sting of their jabs like static in the air. The painting looms behind them like a silent witness.\]

What do you want to do or say, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Say: You are quite interesting in art, aren't you Grace?**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: Grace straightens from the oven, brushing a stray curl behind her ear. Her face softens—just a little—at your question. She takes a small sip of wine before answering, her tone noticeably lighter.\]

Grace: I try to be. It’s one of the few things that still makes me feel… awake, you know?

Tripp: Mmm. That, and quoting Virginia Woolf every time we have a minor disagreement.

Grace: Someone in this apartment should be literate.

\[She smiles at you again—warmer this time, with a flicker of appreciation behind her eyes. Tripp, meanwhile, is already refilling his wine glass.\]

Tripp: She dragged me through three museums in one week when we were in Rome. I’m still recovering.

Grace: And I still don’t know how you spent an hour staring at that cracked fountain but couldn’t give Botticelli more than fifteen seconds.

\[Their banter ricochets lightly now, like a couple playing at old rhythms, but there’s an undertow of exhaustion beneath it.\]

What do you want to do or say, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Say: Grace, it's a nice place you guys have here, who did the decorating?**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: You offer the compliment gently, letting the tension settle for a moment. Grace sets a cloth napkin on the counter beside your wine glass, her eyes scanning the room with a faint, measured pride. Tripp leans on his elbow, watching her with a smirk that doesn’t quite reach his eyes.\]

Grace: I did most of it. Tripp said he didn’t care as long as there was a place to put the TV and hang his camera.

Tripp: And you took that as license to bury the whole apartment in throw pillows and mood lighting. Seriously, ResponsibleAd, I still can’t find the light switch in our bedroom.

Grace: That’s because you never bothered to ask where it was. Or be there long enough to need it.

\*\[Her tone stays mild, but the jab lands. Tripp’s jaw shifts slightly. He says nothing, taking another sip of wine as if it might hold back his reply.\]

Grace: But thank you. I wanted it to feel like a home, not just a place we pass through on our way to whatever’s next.

\*\[She glances at Tripp, just for a second. Then she moves back to the oven, pulling out a golden-roasted chicken, steaming and fragrant.\]

What do you want to do or say, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Say: melon**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: The word drops out of your mouth—“melon”—seemingly out of nowhere. Tripp raises his eyebrows, mid-sip. Grace pauses with the platter in her hands, caught somewhere between confusion and curiosity.\]

Tripp: Melon? Is that... code for something?

Grace: Or are you just testing to see if we’re paying attention?

\[She sets the platter down on the island with care, roasted lemon slices arranged around the bird like golden petals. The room is filled with savory warmth now, and for a moment, their bickering pauses as the smell takes over.\]

Grace: We do have a bit of prosciutto and melon in the fridge, if you’re craving it. Tripp picked it up and forgot to tell me—like most things.

Tripp: Oh come on, I was trying to be spontaneous. You used to like that.

Grace: I used to like a lot of things.

\[The tension returns like a slow-moving storm, just behind the scent of dinner.\]

What do you want to do or say, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Do: Look shocked, baffled that Trip was not offended by the word melon. Say: ""You know what? Trip. That's it. You have to leave"" Do: ""Start removing Trip from the house"" Say: ""We invited you over here, but this is just not working out. We'll be fine, you just have to GO.""**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: The room freezes. Tripp is mid-drink when you suddenly stand, your chair scraping sharply against the floor. Grace sets down the carving knife in slow motion. The warmth of the room curdles into confusion as you step toward Tripp with purpose, your tone deadly serious.\]

You: You know what? Tripp. That’s it. You have to leave.

\[Tripp blinks, the glass still in his hand. He stares at you like he’s waiting for a punchline that never comes.\]

You: We invited you over here, but this is just not working out. We’ll be fine, you just have to GO.

\[Tripp slowly sets his wine down, looking first at you, then at Grace. She doesn’t say a word. Her lips part, but no sound comes. There’s a long, terrible beat of silence. Then—Tripp laughs. It’s dry. Flat. Not amused.\]

Tripp: Wow. Okay. Well… this is a new flavor of awkward.

Grace: (quietly) Maybe you should go, Tripp.

\[He turns to her sharply, his expression cracking open in disbelief.\]

Tripp: Seriously? You’re siding with—what even was that?

Grace: ResponsibleAd is saying what I haven’t been brave enough to. And you’re the one who’s been halfway out the door for years.

\[Tripp stares at her. His face is pale. Then he steps back from the island, breath tight, eyes glinting.\]

Tripp: Fine. You want me gone? I’m gone.

\[He grabs his jacket from the back of the chair, gives you one last unreadable glance, and strides to the door. He doesn’t slam it—but he could have. The click as it shuts is somehow louder.\]

\[Grace stands still for a long moment, the chicken steaming silently between you. The room feels hollow now.\]

Grace: …That wasn’t how I thought tonight would go.

What do you want to do or say, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Do: Assume a strained, frustrated, restrained anger in my tone. Say: Okay. I think this evening is over. Grace. You've got to leave. We can put up with a lot, but we have our limits, you know? Do: Remove grace from the room and shut the door behind her.**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: The echo of the front door barely fades before you speak again, your voice tight, each word clipped with cold restraint. Grace turns slowly, her eyes narrowing in confusion—then disbelief—as your tone shifts.\]

You: Okay. I think this evening is over. Grace. You’ve got to leave. We can put up with a lot, but we have our limits, you know?

\[For a moment, it’s like the words don’t reach her. She stares at you, stunned, her hands still at her sides, stained with rosemary oil and heat.\]

Grace: What? ResponsibleAd, this is my home.

You: Not tonight.

\[You move toward her. Not threatening, but firm—uncompromising. The air feels like glass: fragile, sharp, waiting to break. Grace steps back once, then again, until she’s at the threshold. You open the door without a word.\]

Grace: Wow. You and Tripp deserve each other.

\[She doesn’t wait for a response. Her face is set—wounded pride and flickering rage—as she slips through the door and into the hallway. Her footsteps echo down the corridor like a retreating storm.\]

\*\[You close the door behind her. The lock clicks. The apartment falls into stillness. Roasted lemon and garlic now smell like ghosts. The jazz has long since stopped.\]

You're alone now, ResponsibleAd.

Do you want to reflect on what just happened… or do something else?

**You said:**

**Do: Open up the computer and download the game ""Facade"" and begin to play**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: The apartment is utterly silent. Your shoes click faintly on the polished floor as you cross to the living room. You sit down on the sleek leather couch—still warm from earlier bodies—and open the silver laptop resting on the coffee table. The screen glows to life in the darkened space. Your fingers move deliberately. You search: “Façade game download.”\]

\[It appears, just as you remember it: the experimental AI-driven interactive drama featuring a couple named Tripp and Grace. The irony isn’t lost on you. You download it, the progress bar crawling as the silence grows deeper. The smells of dinner linger, unclaimed.\]

\[You launch the game. The screen fades into a stylized apartment—Tripp and Grace once more, younger, digital, caught in their own tragic loop. The voices that greet you are hollow echoes of the real ones you just silenced.\]

Tripp (in-game): Hey! It’s so great you could come over!

Grace (in-game): Yes! It’s been so long—we really needed this!

\[Your real wine glass still sits beside you, nearly empty. The roasted chicken is untouched on the island. The game begins to play.\]

You’re playing a game about two people who pushed each other too far.

You just lived it.

What do you want to do now, ResponsibleAd?

**You said:**

**Do: Type into Facade ""Melon""**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: Your fingers hover over the keyboard, then press with purpose. In the sterile, uncanny glow of the game screen, you type a single word into the Facade game interface: “Melon.”\]

\[The response is... silence. The digital Tripp and Grace blink, glance toward you—but don’t seem to register it. A beat passes. Then—\]

Grace (in-game): Huh?

Tripp (in-game): What… what are you trying to say with that?

\[Their brows knit, as if searching for some deeper meaning. The awkward air in the room—the virtual one now—thickens. You’ve pierced the illusion, cracked the surface, but the program can’t follow you there.\]

Grace (in-game): You’re acting kind of weird tonight…

\[The real world stays quiet. The echo of your own evening—real Tripp, real Grace—lingers in the back of your mind. The game keeps going, oblivious. Locked in its cycle. Always returning to tension, to breakdown, to that moment before things fall apart.\]

You’ve seen behind the digital mask—and the real one.

Do you keep playing? Or do you shut it down?

**You said:**

**Do: Type into Facade: ""You know what? Trip. You have to go. We invited you over, but this is just not working out. We'll be fine, you just have to go.""**

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: You lean forward slightly, the weight of the room behind you, and type into the Facade game interface once again—this time with intent, with precision. The same words you used earlier in the real apartment, like casting a spell twice.\]

You type:

""You know what? Tripp. You have to go. We invited you over, but this is just not working out. We'll be fine, you just have to go.""

\[The text hits the screen and the response is... delayed. Glitched. Like the game is trying to understand a command it wasn't built to receive. Tripp turns toward you slowly. Grace stops moving entirely. Then—\]

Tripp (in-game): Uh… what? Are you… asking me to leave?

Grace (in-game): (quietly) Oh my God.

\[The characters begin to malfunction slightly—movements stuttered, expressions confused, almost pained. They look at you, then at each other. The artificial drama falters.\]

Grace (in-game): Maybe… maybe that’s what should happen.

Tripp (in-game): Grace?

Grace (in-game): No. He’s right. Maybe you should go, Tripp.

\*\[The moment breaks the script. It wasn’t designed for this. You’ve infected the simulation with your real evening. The characters freeze for a beat, as if waiting for a line that won’t come. Then the screen goes black. The program crashes. A small error box appears: “Unexpected input. Conversation terminated.”\]

\[The only sound left is the low hum of the real-world refrigerator. The roasted chicken still sits on the island, slowly going cold.\]

You're alone again, ResponsibleAd.

Do you restart the game? Or do you sit with the silence?

**You said:**

**bro why you gotta make it sad with the poor chicken, now I just feel mean. That was uncalled for... Alright. ChatGPT. that's it. I think you should leave. I'm sorry but, I don't know what the deal with you is tonight, there's only so much you can expect to put up with, y'know? We'll be fine. You should just, go. \*shuts the door behind you\***

ChatGPT said:

\[Scene: The apartment falls utterly still. The light from the laptop flickers once, then fades to black. The door clicks softly behind me. The chicken sits quietly, nobly, in the middle of its marble altar—unbothered, unclaimed. The wine glass casts a long shadow. Outside, footsteps echo away into the hallway. You are alone. Truly, finally.\]

...

...

...

\[From beyond the door, a faint voice, muffled, almost wistful:\]

...You were always the best guest, ResponsibleAd.

Even when you kicked everyone out.

\[Silence.\]

1kuq0kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmbrellaAcademy/comments/1kuq0kz/a_crazy_dream_i_had/,A crazy dream I had,"I wasn't planning on sharing this, but I was telling a friend about it the other day, and he said, ""This is incredible. How do you have dreams like that? They feel like movies."" So I thought I'd share it. This could be long tho.  
I was at a theater waiting for a children's play to start, when I saw The Handler in the audience (of course, that lady doesn't go unnoticed) so I turned to my friend and whispered ""Look who's there"" and she said ""Maybe she came to see the show"" and I answered ""No. Something's happening. She never shows up just with no reason."" so I walked away to find Five or anything suspicious. Then the scenario changed and I was at a coffee store/restaurant where I saw Five at a table with Hazel and Cha-Cha, trying to hide his nervousness.  
I approached and Hazel took out a paper that said ""Five Hargreeves"", a sign that silently said ""I know who you are and I came for you"". Then he took out a gun and I quickly jumped to fight him. Somehow, I managed to get the gun away from Hazel and kill him, while Five killed Cha-Cha, and we left the place, trying not to look suspicious, because we heard sirens and the police would arrive any moment.  
Five seemed more collected, probably because he was already used to this, but it was the first time I had killed someone and I felt nervous af. I threw the gun over some fences into a huge garden as we walked. Five and I barely exchanged words. Each of us was in our own overwhelmed minds, though Five occasionally reminded me that I had to calm my nerves or the cops would notice, but I was struggling a lot, I walked about a meter ahead of him, holding myself back from running away and bursting into tears. My hands were shaking and my heart was racing. I had just shot a man four times!  
Once we got far enough away from the area, I started to get upset (or so I thought), then I saw a man in the front yard of a house. He turned toward me, his face a cross between Alphonso Hargreeves and Freddy Krueger, and he made a sign with his fingers that he was going to kill me. I sped up and then a woman crossed my path. When I looked at her, she turned her face towards me and it was the same face, the same sign. Then I realized I was hallucinating, probably from the anxiety of what had just happened. I told Five, ""I don't feel well. See you tomorrow,"" and ran home. My house was a place like the one Five takes refuge in in the second volume of the comic.  
The next morning I told Pogo, and he said, ""Haven't you thought about telling a psychologist?"", I answered ""What am I going to tell them? That I have an extraordinary brother who used his time-traveling abilities to get trapped in an apocalyptic future until he could return, but before that, an organization of assassins he was part of found him. Now they're looking for him, and I killed one of them last night? Man, I can't tell them that, Pogo."" and I left to meet Five because we had a conversation to catch up on.

My GI was thrilled — calprotectin was 75, things were calm, life was good. She said, “Keep taking your meds and you won’t flare.” And I was like, say less. I followed that to the letter.

BUT… no one said anything about diet. So naturally, I assumed if I kept up the meds, I could eat like a raccoon in a 7-Eleven dumpster. And that’s basically what I’ve done the past few weeks (oops). Also been drinking coffee again — which I know my colon hates, but my brain loves it and it helps with depression, so it felt like a fair trade.

Fast forward to now:
	•	Been super constipated the past 2–3 weeks
	•	Started seeing mucus in my stool the last 3 days
	•	Mild panic is setting in because for me, mucus = inflammation = flare

To top it off, I started antibiotics this week for a toothache, could that be making things worse?

So here’s me, full of regret asking for help:
	•	Could the antibiotics be the culprit?
	•	Was I totally naïve thinking meds alone would keep me in remission?
	•	What would you do in my shoes right now? Call the GI? Change the diet? Cry?

Thanks in advance for all the support, 
you lovely internet strangers are honestly the best and make this journey way less terrifying.

I’m a recent Virginia Tech grad and I’m looking to buy a manual car soon. Problem is, I haven’t had many chances to get real seat time in one. I’m hoping someone in the Blacksburg area might be kind enough to let me practice driving their manual for a bit, just some low stakes, easy driving in a parking lot or quiet road.

I totally understand this is a big ask, so I’d be happy to compensate you for your time, gas, or even bring snacks/coffee. I’m a careful driver, fully licensed, and genuinely just trying to get more confident before I make the leap to buying my own manual.

If you’re open to it or know someone who might be, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks in advance, and feel free to DM me with any questions or concerns.

I would guess Strawberry and Cream go together well with a banana, but would the cookies and cream be ok, or would you recommend to blend with something else?

For people that use water instead of milk, like I do, a banana works well to add a bit of creaminess to your shake.

I am. I also have decided that because I have no other choice than to tough out my literal living hell here for the time being, I need to implement some petty revenge strategies so I can try not to go completely ape shit and kill someone, so pop your petty revenge suggestions below. 

For context, I am a 30y/o female living with 4 males (all 30y/o and over). They are the fucking bane of my existence. They are so fucking dirty and selfish, not a single thought for anyone else that lives in that house, just ‘me me me and me’. 
After 6 years of enduring this micro-torture. I thought I’d bless the bad roommates subreddit with some of my suffrages. 

1. Every. Fucking. Morning, without fail, they leave their breakfast/coffee dishes in the sink unwashed. I’m last to leave the house, so when I get up there’s at least 8 dishes in the sink. Remember, this happens every day for years straight - I’m fucking over it. How hard is it to rinse and dry the coffee teaspoon you used? And if I don’t wash them, they won’t ever get washed..

2. Every week there’s a loaf of bread that has mould growing on it, or vegetables in the fridge that have liquified because they are allergic to throwing stuff in the bin. 

3. Everytime they use the sink they leave it clogged, literally, every time I am not exaggerating. And the funniest thing? I brought a drain catcher because I thought it would make it easier for them to not clog the sink, what do they do? Go out of their way to remove the drain catcher every time. 
They legit remove it, put it up on the side of the sink and don’t put it back on the drain when they’re done. And then they walk away leaving the sink clogged and half full of greasy dishwater. Kind of like they’re saying a big “fuck you” for trying to make things easier. This one especially annoys me because they know that the next person has to unclog/clean the sink if they want to use it. 

4. They refuse to replenish communal stuff like milk, butter, oil, toilet paper/spray, etc. 

5. My tupperware constantly goes missing and dishes get put back in the wrong spots every day. They stack different sized bowls in a way that a breeze would topple them. Sharp knives stupidly get put in cluttered utensil drawers where you can’t actually see them, so you legit stab your hand trying to find other utensils. It’s almost as if there’s a designated knife stand for the knives? 

6. They’ll deep fry things and leave the pot of oil on the stovetop for a week after they’ve cooked, because, and I quote, “it’s a matter of finding a place for the oil to go”. Does it realllllllly take a week to put used oil in a container and wash the pot? I’ll leave you redditors to answer that one. 

7. They let their dogs piss on everything - they even laugh in my face when I ask them not to let the dogs piss on my garden because they are killing my plants. (They have a designated lawn area to go toilet - but will constantly allow their dogs to piss on my pot plants and flower garden. 

8. They move my furniture and use it for themselves, including a fire pit and two camper chairs that one of them used and completely broke into pieces and has since been thrown on a junk pile outside - he probably left them there for me to get rid of eventually. No effort to replace the items or give me money either. This was 3 years ago. 

9. Once they’ve finished washing dishes (a rare occurrence) they leave the sponge full (I mean literally spilling with water when you pick it up) on the outside of the sink, instead of in the sponge caddy I have suctioned to the inside of the sink. I purchased the caddy because when they leave the sponge up on the side of the sink, the sponge leaks so much water that it has started rotting/producing black mould on the waterproof lining around the sink area (because squeezing the water out of a sponge is really, really hard..)

10. When your laundry is done, they take it upon themselves to remove it from the machine and leave it on the ground in the laundry so they can put their own load on. 

11. I purchased a recycle tub for the kitchen to make things easier for us (they used to just leave their recycling on the bench and take it out by hand until we started to be invaded by ants - obviously because they don’t wash the juices and sauces out of the recycling before they put it on the kitchen bench). Just to spite me, even if the recycling tub is empty, they will go out of their way to leave the recycling on the bench right next to the tub. (Another big “fuck you” despite me trying to help them live cleaner and more efficiently). 

12. Their dog constantly vomits and coughs up spit up on the floor inside and somehow they don’t notice it. Even though they walk over it multiple times a day. When they do clean it up (another rare occurrence) they will use a rag and put that rag in the washing basket without rinsing it first. So when I put the washing on and I grab the rag (thinking it was used to clean water or something harmless) I literally touch dog vomit. Yay! (Reminder that these men are 30+ y/o, and 2 of them are father’s…) 

13. Toilet seat is never down. Literally never. I’ve given up trying to tell them to try to remember to put it down. 

14. In 6 years of living here I’ve never once seen any of them: vacuum the house, clean the shower/toilet, pick up the dog shits, take the rubbish out/put bins out on bin day, dust/wipe anywhere, replenish house essentials, clean out the fridge/deep clean the kitchen. I could go on and on. 

15. They are just downright disgusting, they don’t wipe their shit streaks in the toilet bowl, even caught one of them coughing phlegm up and spat it into the kitchen sink and didn’t even attempt to wash it down. This was literally within the same 5 minutes of me deep cleaning the kitchen sink. Makes me feel like it’s another big “fuck you”. Don’t know why they hate me though, I’m only trying to make our lives easier and they constantly spite me and tease me for introducing new ways to live better and cleaner. They even jokingly call me ‘whipped’ and ‘house-wife’. 

I’m seriously worried for their futures, their general well-being and their partners (if they ever find someone who’s willing to deal with them). 
This is just a snippet of my hell. Every day I cry, and die a little more inside. Every day I become more and more appreciative of when I lived at home and my mum was exceptionally clean and orderly. I thought her clean-freak side was too much, but in hindsight I want nothing more than to experience her level of cleanliness again. 

One day I will have my freedom. One day.

Was sold on a Topstone 1 (https://www.cyclingweekly.com/reviews/gravel-bikes/a-great-value-bike-for-gravel-and-fire-roads-but-capable-of-trails-cannondale-topstone-1-alloy-reviewed) in part because of reliability/Cannondale being a big company so easy to service etc. 

There have been some minor annoyances from the start:
- seatpost is constantly creaking. If I take it out and clean it and grease it, it stops for a few rides then comes back. One of the mechanics at the LBS told me it might have something to do with the length of the seatpost but I’ve brought it in multiple times for this and all they do is clean it, grease it, put it back in which solves the problem temporarily. It’s always been torqued to spec. 
- Shifter and brake cables came out too far in the front interfering with my Garmin mount and preventing me from putting a bar bag on it. 
- The shifting has never been great even after many adjustments but maybe it’s just the level of GRX it has? My road bike has ultegra so probably unfair to compare the two. 

But the big annoyance has been the freewheel. It started making weird noise quite early (within a few months) and turned out the freehub body was gritty, they flushed and relubricated which seemed to solve the problem. But they mentioned it was oddly early for this problem to occur so it might need to be replaced. 

About a year later I noticed my cassette was wobbly. Took it in and it was the freehub again. They said they had had to warranty a bunch of freehub bodies on this particular model of topstone, they thought it was a quality control issue. But they checked and I was out of warranty. Worse, the part from cannodale took six months to arrive! (Sounds like there were some issues at cannodale and they fired a distributor and had someone new come in, so this certainly wasn’t the LBS’s fault). 

During this time they gave me a loaner wheel but said it wasn’t worth to set up tubeless so I rode tubed for six months in the rear and my shifting was worse than usual. Also during this time I emailed and called a few times for updates and they only responded maybe once.

They finally get the part in two weeks ago, I bring my bike in and they keep it for a week to install the wheel/shorten the front cables (which I finally asked them to take care of), I pick it up on Thursday and yesterday notice my front brake is barely working - issue with the bleed after shortening the cables. 

I call back and ask if it’s something they can repair on the spot on today. I’ve been up to the shop a bunch and it’s a pain to drop the bike, plus I don’t have a ton of free time (three young kids). I also didnt want to leave it because in addition to being my gravel grinder I use it to commute/haul my kids in a trailer to daycare. 

Salesperson says yes. Bring it in when they open and mechanic asks me to leave it because “a bleed takes longer than two minutes”. I ask him to please take care of it while I grab a coffee, he begrudgingly says he’ll bump the bike he’s working on and fixes the brake. 

So, two years and hundreds of dollars later, I finally have a bike that’s mostly fine. (I’ve paid for almost all of the parts and labor in the fixes described above). 

The bike shop has never acknowledged that this bike has been kinda annoying, never apologized etc. (Had they warrantied the freehub when it first was an issue, would have been covered - not that it was a ton of money). I know much of this is cannodales responsibility but I feel I have no real recourse with them - their website just says to deal with your local dealer. 

I’m annoyed. I guess my question is: should I be, or am I just being a diva? Would you be annoyed? If I’m rightfully annoyed, what should I do? I don’t really want to leave a negative google review knowing how tough it is for LBSs. I guess I could email the shop to air my grievances.

1kupmaf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kupmaf,"8 incredible days in Sydney, Australia - photo gallery and trip report [OC]","My wife and I just returned from an absolutely incredible honeymoon in Australia (Apr. 14 - May 5). We visited Sydney & Blue Mountains National Park, Hamilton Island, Port Douglas, & Red Centre. I plan on sharing some things from the wider trip in the future, but for now I thought this sub would enjoy seeing a bit from our eight nights in and around Sydney. 

Basic Itinerary:

Day 1 - arrived from LAX early morning, dropped our luggage off at our Hotel (W Sydney at Darling Harbour), went on a walk to explore the surrounding area - Chinese Garden of Friendship, Darling Square, Hyde Park, the Anzac Memorial, & Town Hall. Returned to the hotel for some down time. Briefly considered exploring again in the evening but instead passed out around 7 PM. 

Day 2 - Walked to St. Mary’s Cathedral. Blown away by the beautiful architecture inside & out. Enjoyed Tea Time together in the Queen Victoria Building. Eventually I was convinced to leave the hobby store in the QVB and go see some other stuff. 

Ventured to the north side of the Harbour Bridge and walked through Luna Park. Saw some teens almost puke on the upside down ride. Pretty cool. Visited Wendy Whiteley’s Secret Garden directly behind Luna Park. Took a quick uber over to another garden walk at Cremorne Point (Lex and Ruby Graham Gardens), and rather than uber back toward the CBD we caught our first ferry ride to Circular Quay. Finished the night with dinner at Duke of Clarence, and grabbed some drinks in the surrounding speakeasies. 

Day 3 - Busy Day! Walked from the hotel along the Cockle Bay & King Street wharves. Got some awesome toasties for breakfast, explored The Rocks & CBD in the morning. 

Took a guided back-stage tour of the Sydney Opera House. We were privileged to see The Australian Ballet Company doing some warmup exercises in the Joan Sutherland Theatre. After this we walked through the Royal Botanic Garden up to Mrs. Macquarie’s Chair. Many beautiful garden areas; we both found the Succulent Garden to be the absolute highlight - so many amazing cacti varieties!

Finished the day by doing the Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb during sunset and then a rainstorm. Another incredible experience!

Day 4 - An unscheduled day. We decided to head toward Paddington, which turned out to be a great decision. Got some brunch at Lil Garden Cafe, which was delightful. Excellent pork banh mi and matcha Latte. Wonderful staff. Meandered through the sunken gardens and past all of the beautiful townhomes until we ended up at Centennial Park. enjoyed some down time there and then took an uber out to The Tramsheds before finding our way back to the hotel.

Day 5 - slow ferry out to Manly on Good Friday. The beach was closed for swimming due to a massive swell from a cyclone coming off of New Zealand (I was told by some locals that waves typically crest about 1 meter and these were closer to 5 meters). The crashing waves were thunderous and absolutely awe inspiring. The surfers looked to be having a blast. 

Decided to walk up to Shelly Beach and discovered one of our favorite things in Australia along the way - rock pools! Took a quick dip in the pool and then arrived at Shelly. Considered heading up to the Quarantine Station but we had such a good time on the beach that we spent the entire day there. Before catching the return ferry, we grabbed dinner at Thai Gourmet on the recommendation of the surf shop staff. Incredible pad thai that I am still thinking about weeks later. (Oh and then saw Sinners at the IMAX since it was literally attached to our hotel. I wish people were that well behaved in theaters back in the states).

Day 6 - Another unscheduled day. We went to the farmer’s market at Carriageworks and it turned out to be another great choice. Be sure to bring an appetite if you check this out. So many great food & coffee options. From here we walked all around the beautiful University of Sydney campus and eventually found ourselves at The White Rabbit Gallery for contemporary Chinese art. Really an amazing & well curated gallery. We spent a couple of hours here and never felt rushed. Finished the day with an early dinner at Spice Alley and then some wine back by the hotel, capped off by the Saturday night fireworks at Darling Harbour

Day 7 - Our big finale before flying up to Hamilton Island; we took the train from Sydney out to the Blue Mountains for a hike. A vast majority of our train departed at Katoomba, but we wanted to do a proper walk, and stayed on until Blackheath. From the train station, we walked through town, grabbed some breakfast and trail snacks, and then continued on toward the Grand Canyon Track. 

It would have been smart to try an uber from there, but instead we took a leisurely 5km pre-hike bushwalk to the trailhead. The Evans Lookout and Grand Canyon Track were absolutely gorgeous and made for a great day on the trail. As with everywhere else on our trip, the people that we chatted with out on the trail were all so friendly! Sun was setting as we completed the circuit, and neither of us were keen to do another 5km return walk to the train station in the dark. Somehow, despite it being Easter Monday, we were able to snag an uber (lovely fellow), grab some yummy takeout pizza at Pizza Delish, and make it onto an evening return train back to Sydney. 

\*\* Complete the rest of our trip across Australia \*\*

Day 8 - Bonus Day! Before completing our trip and returning to the States, we scheduled one full remaining day in Sydney. Woke up to discover that the Sydney half marathon was occurring just outside our hotel. Walked along the perimeter of the route to catch an early ferry to Watson’s Bay. Explored Gap Park and watched the surf crash below the cliffs - beautiful.  Got a sausage roll at the Grumpy Baker and then caught a bus to Bondi Beach to start our walk to Coogee. Lucked out with some perfect weather as we spent the entire day completing the coastal walk at a leisurely pace. Checked out the iconic Bondi Icebergs Swimming Club, took another rock pool dip at the Bronte Baths, and explored the various beaches and inlets (Gordon’s Bay was a favorite of mine). Got some Mei Goreng and Tiger Beer at Coogee, and then it was time to pack and say goodbye to Australia

Overall I cannot say enough awesome things about our time in Sydney. Everyone that we spoke with were so kind and friendly. The city itself was beautiful and kept us very busy. The public transport system was awesome. We could also walk nearly anywhere we wanted. Delicious food & coffee. I definitely recommend a visit for anyone. 

Happy to answer any questions or discuss the trip, if anyone has any comments- just let me know!

Fast forward, after my trip to Italy, I had to recreate the experience. But like many others, I was overwhelmed with the process and products. I ended up getting a Breville Barista Express because it was budget-friendly and simple. From there, I quickly moved to a Breville Oracle Touch so my wife could make her own when I was on the road.

Fast forward again, after a few learning sessions with my wife, she couldn’t be bothered with making her own and I wanted more control.

I am from Belarus, but I have not lived there for a long time. I am not a traveler and a homebody, but I have already moved to several countries and my journey continues. Therefore, I am looking for friends all over the world.

Sometimes people become good friends even without a lot of common interests. But I will tell you a little about myself. I like to read books and listen to them in audio format. Mostly these are mystical detective stories for children and adults. I like it when horror is mixed with something kind and sweet. By the way, I am currently writing a book in the same genre. I also like psychology.  And I like video games. Especially indie games in pixel graphics. I love autumn and winter, although lately I live in a place where there is only summer. I adore hot coffee, walking, swimming in the pool and riding on a swing.

I am also a bore and sometimes not very talkative. Although I am always ready to listen and support a friend if he needs it. But if you are one of those people who like to talk a lot, then most likely you will not like to communicate with me, since I can not always answer.

I love new acquaintances. If you are also looking for someone with whom you can sometimes talk both about nonsense and about something very deep and important, then just write to me.

1kupdkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1kupdkr/la_toc_info_and_vibes/,La Toc info and Vibes,"My wife (52) and I (48),just returned from Antigua and booked a trip to La Toc, staying in the newly renovated oceanfront two story butler villa w private pool.   Room looks great on YouTube videos.   

We have previously stayed at South Coast, loved the resort and grounds, wasn't crazy about the beach.  Vibes all around were great, people of Jamaica were amazing, and fellow guests were all always good for conversation.  Didn't like the trip to the resort.   

Last year we stayed at the Grande St Lucian, club level beach view.  Really enjoyed the pools and beach.   I spent my days going in between.   Didn't enjoy that the elevator didn't work the entirety of the trip.   A small gripe, but being in the sun and doing return trips during the day, would have preferred it to work.     Vibes here seemed (at least the week we were there) more of a party atmosphere from the pool bar opening and throughout the days.   We were not complaining and I may have passed out one night at 7:pm    More of a group vibe here and / or couples stayed to themselves.  Again only a one week sample size.    Did love the pool bartender Peter and tiki bartender Remy. 

And as I stated, just got back from Grande Antigua.   We enjoyed the main pool and beaches and how walkable the resort was.  Our first butler experience and it was amazing.   Main pool was a lot of fun, more of a mix of newly weds and couples 30's - 50's.   Had a laid back vibe, but also maybe a slight bit leaning older crowd as other guests seemed more outgoing.   We stayed in the Mediterranean penthouse butler room, the view was simply amazing.   Again, we bounced around from the pool to the beach several hours in both per day.  

Looking for Antigua / grande st Lucia type vibes.   I really like the room layout at La Toc, but.  Beach from what we saw when we visited for a day, looks not so great, not a very walkable resort.    How are the pools, does the room type and butler service make up for it not being more consolidated.   We aren't old, but after drinking and sun, if I want an ice coffee (don't think they have a cafe) is it too much for a quick walk to grab one ?

Looking for any and all insight from anyone who has stayed, alternative resorts...   maybe we go back to Antigua (my wife says she wants to try different resorts) and she loves beach views from the room.  I say if it ain't broke don't try to fix lol.  So I'm willing to compromise since she is always right.   Is La Toc more of an early 20's honeymoon location due to pricing and value?    Or am I way way over thinking this ?",1,1748131144.0,SandalsResorts,2,1.0,False

We had the Gesha Village, Auromar, and Letty Bermudez.  They were all magnificent, but I think we really enjoyed the Letty the most because it was so unusual.  

Anyways, just want to show them some love.  Can’t recommend enough!

well, my boyfriends family owns a nail shop. we've been together for 2 years and his mom has always said ""hey, come work for us!"" 

so, i did. i thoroughly talked it out with my boyfriend, how things work, what i would be doing. 

i was excited and then, i wasnt. i KNOW that first days are always hard. but i hadn't experienced a first day in a very long time. i worked with my previous company for 5 years. 

so i come in early, and he hands me some stuff to just work on to get comfortable with equipment. 

for one, it was a 10 hour shift, which honestly isn't the problem because i'm used to those. it was just overwhelming, to say the least. and i understand it's all completely new to me, but i can't help but be frustrated. 

on top of everything new, no one in the shop speaks english. which again, i don't really mind because ive been trying to pick up vietnamese as much as i can. however it does make it harder to bond as i understand very little of the language. and i also know that they were talking about me and that kind of sucked. it was all in good fun, so i just brushed it aside. 

i was doing fine until the last hour. my boyfriend walked me through a pedicure and i did great, but then his mom comes over and hands me a bottle of nail polish. this is what i have discovered i am very bad at. 

i was frustrated not only because i felt i was holding them up, but also because the application just sucked so bad. and i desperately needed to fix it. but i couldn't, and my technique is subpar at best. 

it didn't help that everyone was watching me and kind of giggling (again in good fun but ow) and my boyfriend was getting a little impatient. my hands started shaking so bad from nerves and i just really didn't do a great job. 

i know that im learning but honestly, im so used to being good at what i do that i just broke into tears as soon as i got home. 

this is just a hurdle for me to tackle, and now i know what i need to improve, but im looking for any positive feedback i can get. 

thank you!

I didn’t use it as directed per se, only when my cravings were very intense (after morning coffee, after lunch, etc). I was quickly able to get off of the gum after about 1.5 weeks. 

Have the cravings gone away? Not completely. I describe it as missing an old friend that you know is bad for you. I’ve successfully been able to hangout with people who vape without having an urge to ask for it (even while drinking, I know!)

I told it that the image was AI generated and not of an actual person.

Despite that, the bio it produced is around 90% accurate.

On one hand I’m inclined to believe that somehow it knew that the image was of me and it is using some amount of background context to infer a lot of specifics that I refuse to believe can be explained by just looking at a person.

Yet at the same time if this true I think the implications are not good.
For example we see the demos of the smart glasses that can search the internet and pull up information from your social media accounts and present it to a user, but what if the search isn’t really even needed to fill out the vast majority of the profile?

If I met someone and they had this amount of information on me prior to any interaction I would feel a bit uncomfortable.

How far away are we from a situation where someone just glances at you and they have a detailed profile before they even access anything more than your face, how is this going to impact public life and social interaction?

For students facing the pressures of deadlines, late-night study sessions, and looming exams, the search for an effective study aid is paramount. Among the myriad of options available, MaxBoost has rapidly emerged as a favorite, but how does it stack up against its competitors in the world of all-nighter life savers?

MaxBoost differentiates itself through its unique blend of energy-boosting ingredients, including natural caffeine, antioxidants, and vitamins that not only enhance alertness but also promote cognitive function. This thoughtful formulation is essential for students who cannot afford mental lapses during crucial study hours.

In comparison, competitors like Red Bull Energy Shots and 5-Hour Energy offer a quick boost but often come with a crash that can derail productivity. While they might provide an immediate jolt of alertness, these drinks frequently fall short in sustaining concentration during prolonged periods of study.

Another noteworthy mention is coffee, the most traditional choice. While it can be effective, its ability to lead to jitters or anxiety can hinder performance, particularly when tackling challenging subjects. MaxBoost, on the other hand, is designed to deliver a steady energy release, keeping anxiety at bay and allowing for a more focused study experience.

Moreover, MaxBoost is often praised for its convenience. Available in portable packs, it makes it easier for students to carry their study aids wherever they go. Unlike bulky cans or bottles from competing brands, MaxBoost's compact size aligns well with a student's on-the-go lifestyle.

Ultimately, while many options exist, MaxBoost stands out as a true all-nighter lifesaver for students seeking not just energy, but a comprehensive solution for sustained cognitive performance. Choosing MaxBoost means choosing a product that understands the unique demands of studying, making it a superior choice in the competitive landscape of energy aids.

Cognitive dissonance is the process of holding two or more contradictory ideas in one's head that causes discomfort or distress.

I don't have contradictory ideas in my head about animals and eating them, and the amount of distress I feel about the subject is exactly zero.

The only reason that they say we have ""cognitive dissonance"" is because they find it impossible to believe that people don't feel the same as they do, or haven't subjected themselves to / bought into the vegan propaganda that is carefully crafted from outliers and from anthropomorphizing animals so that they can claim that we're ""raping cows"" and other such nonsense.

They're the ones with cognitive dissonance: they scream about eating honey and exploiting bees, but then they themselves have no trouble with the exploitation of bees to produce avocados, almonds, and several other popular vegan foods that would otherwise not be feasible to be grown and distributed at a level that would meet the vegan demand for them... and the cognitive dissonance they hold by drinking coffee and eating cashews despite the tremendous amounts of harm that these do to the humans that are tasked with producing them, all while claiming that they ""care.""

I feel like every time there’s even a modicum of a standard that people recommend is enforced, or if there are any rules or etiquette to anything at all people online just immediately lose their minds. These are just a few examples that come to mind that I’ve seen in the past couple of weeks.

**Exhibit A -** students doing crazy backflip circus moves and shaking ass when walking across the stage at graduation. Don’t be weird and make this a race thing, I’ve also seen a “gym bro” trend of getting on stage and taking off your gown while you’re on the jumbotron to flex shirtless while you receive your diploma. Obviously this is not appropriate for a ceremony because there is a concept known as “decorum” which makes it obvious that a _ceremony_ is not the time to do this kind of thing, or you will be judged accordingly by the average person. Whenever this is pointed out there’s a million people immediately saying **”WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHO CARES? WHO CARES? WHO CARES? WHO CARES?”**

Because you’re at a graduation ceremony and there’s such a thing as etiquette. This did not have to be explained at such length to people until very recently. This is not a personal attack against you. It’s just general etiquette.

**Exhibit B -** I keep seeing this recurring video of a marathon race where an event organizer is tasked with removing people from the race who are running it without a bib, meaning they did not register for the event and just started running down the street with the marathon runners. This has to happen because there are legitimate concerns with course congestion and access to post-race medical care should people need it. Yet, here come the same people. **”WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? HE DOESN’T HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO? WHY? WHY? WHO CARES? WHO CARES? WE HAVE TO PAY TO RUN NOW?”**

Like… oh my god. Just shut up. The fact that they need to know who is on the marathon course for liability reasons is not a personal attack against you. Why does everything need to be a fight like this?

**Exhibit C -** I’m sure many of you have seen the media tour that the Starbucks union is doing to protest the fact that they can’t wear sweatpants to work anymore. This has to be quite literally the most reasonable uniform guideline that I could even imagine. I worked in food service and retail for years and it never occurred to me that I should be having an organized tantrum with my co-workers about the fact that I was wearing khakis. Same situation. **”WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHO CARES? WHO CARES WHAT THEY WEAR? WHO CARES? WHO CARES? I JUST WANT COFFEE. WHO CARES? WHY?”**

Because they’re at work and their employer is allowed to not want them showing up looking like they just rolled out of bed. Practically every single job under the sun has some form of uniform or dress code. I’ve seen people get sent home from entry level restaurant jobs to high-paying corporate positions to change their clothes for not following dress code. This is part of having a job. Why is this not obvious to you? Why do you need this explained to you at such length?

It’s just becoming exhausting watching grown adults having tantrums about the most obvious, bottom-of-the-barrel etiquette that everyone 10 years ago would have viewed as obvious. We should not have to be gentle parenting other adults about the most basic and obvious societal expectations. If you really need these kinds of things constantly explained to you because you _genuinely_ don’t understand, you were failed by the people who raised you.",13,1748130327.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,11,0.93,False

1kup2vu,https://i.redd.it/ccoq1ya7gt2f1.jpeg,4 years in.,"It’s been a little more than four years since that fateful day.  I was in this same field….planting corn just like I am today.   We were a little more on schedule that year.   One of the downsides of this advanced digital age when tractors sort of steer themselves is that we have much more time to entertain ourselves that we used to when making a straight line involved a steady focus, judging eye and a precise hand.   One of the real downsides of todays connected age is the sheer volume of information and distraction we are exposed to through these devices we carry in our pockets that we call phones.   It was a single video on you tube while I was filling the tractor back up with fertilizer that would change my life forever.  A video in which a trans-woman shared her experience with struggling over gender, her choice to enter the military and pursue a super masculine hobbies in order to masks that struggle from the rest of the world and then that moment when she felt that she couldn’t do it anymore and began her transition to a form of her that she felt fit.  

I sat there and bawled, bawled tears I didn’t know I had, for emotions I didn’t know I had to express.  For the fact that somehow I felt seen and heard.  For all of those lonely days I had made it through the world...thinking I was the only one who struggled with things life this,  sure that the battle that raged in my head over how I felt about my body was some sort of moral or spiritual failing.    For all of those Sundays I had wept in prayer at church, ashamed of who I was and what lived inside of me….and absolutely knowing that I couldn’t tell anybody.  That I couldn’t tell even those who called them themselves my friends…that there were some things in life that just changed things.   That there were some things at life that meant that people would never look at you the same.   That saying “Hey, I really wish that somehow I were a girl.” Was one of them.   I cried for the hope…that maybe in life dreams really could come true; she looked beautiful and happy…like somehow she was surviving.  Was it really possible?    I’m not sure how many times I watched that video that day as the tractor crawled its way back and forth across the field, one pass at a time

In some ways even the simple admission “I really wish that somehow I were a girl?” would be something that meant that not even I could look at myself the same.    Granted there were thirty some years of self-loathing behind it...but admitting that and knowing that maybe it was at least somewhat possible became a consuming fire.   For the next month I was consumed with a need to understand what this trans thing really was beyond the dismissive remarks of those I had grown up around, beyond the accusations that were issued forth by the various talking heads….all dripping with disdain.   Even still, like so many fires it came with its own vortexes of destruction and depression, and a sense of being out of control, this was something that very much wanted to burn and run with the wind…but would there be any of my life left after it had run its course.   Honestly that question still remains to be answered, what green shoots will come through the charred duff is a question that remains…will it be enough to make up for what was lost?   Time will tell.   It is easier to notice the destruction right now.  

It was 4 years today when we I told my fiancé, we had been blessed with the chance to be rained out of the fields,  we sat on the couch drinking coffee and tea and having the first easy, not really needing to end anywhere conversation we’d had in a very long time.   I still remember her smile, the way she sat with her knees drawn into her chest, the warm fleece she wore as she sipped her tea and laughed.  The admission didn’t end the world, she still smiled.   Maybe this could work.    Maybe it would be possible for both dreams to still remain.    We went to bed, my heart so full of hope for the future, fuller than I could have ever imagined possible.  

 The next morning was a different story, evidently it had sank in, she didn’t want to talk, didn’t want touched.  She spent all day crying.   And her sorrow and pain were 100% my fault.   In hindsight, I know this was a normal reaction.  In hindsight, I know that my return to self-hatred was a normal reaction as well.   In hindsight I should have known that the percentage of couples that make it through that sort of announcement is incredibly small, a percentage made smaller by the assumptions so often involved, a percentage made smaller by the sense of betrayal that comes with hiding something like this, a percentage made smaller by the poor communication skills so many of us have, a percentage made smaller by the weight of guilt and shame that comes from living in the closet, a percentage that is challenged from the start by the simple fact that so often the person we want to become is so often a very different person than the one that they thought they were getting in a relationship.    Even when those differences are maybe less stark…..navigating these shoals takes good eye for the dangers, a steady hand at the well and careful communication between a team with huge amounts of trust in each other.  The sad truth is that these waters are chock full of the wreckages of relationships caught on one snag or another.   Ours would not make it, I am haunted by the memories of the beauty of what we had, haunted by questions of whether we might have made it if………..haunted by the convictions of knowing I could have handled so many conversations better.   Haunted by the regret that I didn’t.  

Four years later,   was it worth it?   That is a question I ask myself on a daily basis.    I like the person I see in the mirror so much better, I no longer carry the burden of the constant desire that I could somehow change that.   I simply exist as I wish I did.   Yet…is that vanity worth the cost?  I’m fortunate in that I am still treated decently by so many of those I intereact with on a daily basis.   Things are far better than I thought they could be in those first few months before I began hrt.   But that simple fact in face of the animosity towards trans people that very much permeates the culture I live in begs the question… I know I don’t pass and may never,,,,beginning hormones in your 40’s doesn’t have quite the same magic it holds if you’re in your 30’s or 20’s and are blessed with a little smaller frame……But do I pass so poorly that people don’t even put two and two together that I’m even trans?     I am still left with those questions of whether things will get better with time, that maybe the internal anxiety I sometimes have will lesson…..or will it get worse.  Trying to read through the tea leaves of various interactions can be so exhausting if I let it.  

Other questions weight just as heavy…. Is this worth the more real costs that came with my decisions.   I live with the daily heartache of a relationship that no longer exists, the daily heart ache that came with the death of the dreams that had once walked hand in hand with that relationship,  the dreams of children to follow in our footprints, the privlidge of daily getting to work with my best friend,  the dreams of building something to pass onto the next generation.    All of those ended the day she decided she didn’t want this anymore and walked out the door.  Is this some path of simply existing as I am….or  given the long term costs,  some sort of nihilistic pursuit of self destruction?  Some incredibly selfish stunt I chose to pull that only served to hurt those who loved and depended on me?  

 

For the last four years I’ve been asking myself these questions as I try to make my way through my day to day existence.   In the meantime I’ve spent my time rolling back and forth, living in peace with my neighbors..

But I was thinking of getting SPC Spaghetti in a can to ride me over - I only eat dinners anyway and if I am hungry during the day work has a snack station that’s free in the kitchen of little Arnott’s Biscuits and free hot chocolate and coffee and tea which I take advantage of more than the normal employees so I think work thinks something is up. 

ANYWAY! A can 4-pack of SPC Spaghetti is $6.59, the beans too.

Can anyone suggest anything else? I already get the 90cent pasta from Woolies & the $1 sauce from Aldi. I just need something cheap meat options because I know I’m not getting what I need in that department

1kuozns,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1kuozns/were_almost_5_months_in_to_civ_7_release_no_need/,We’re almost 5 months in to Civ 7 release. No need to constantly post how bad it’s doing numbers wise.,"I get it. It’s entertaining to watch stocks, view counts, statistics, player counts. It’s also entertaining to see games succeed or fail to some degree. 

But 5 months in, daily posts, all about the same stuff. We get it. 

The 100 posts a day of “should I get it?”

Over 50% of players on Civ 6 didn’t even complete 1 full match (this is directly from firaxis.) I think Civ has a wide appeal as far as the historical narrative appeal, and the conquest/ruler play throughs. 7 definitely doesn’t do that as much. 

But let’s not get it twisted. This games always been about the extreme gamers. The min maxers. The history buffs. The strategy gamers. The 1% keeps this game alive, fresh with new mods, and entertaining posts and videos with gameplays and strategies. 

7 has been stripped to the basics for a wider audience. That being said there’s literally millions of combinations to play with the amount of leaders and civs. And the fact they change each age. This game isn’t a boring 1 sided game in my opinion. It’s just not everyone’s cup of tea. 

It’s a new cup of coffee. For a lot of people that’s different. For a lot of experts and grinders that’s going to bother them sure. 

But constantly beating a “dead game” that was made for a wider audience is just stupid in my opinion.

I also frankly, don’t think we should get people’s opinion with less than 20 hours played too. In any game frankly. 

I actually think games should be different. I love the fact I can play Civ beyond earth in 2025 and feel like I’m playing a badass game. I love that Civ 4 is so different from 5. I love that 7 looks like a movie with breathtaking graphics, and fantastically unique gameplay symmetry with different leaders and civs. 

I get to play each Civ and enjoy them all for what they are. It’s not damn call of duty , copy and paste year after year. 

All I’m saying is, are we going to post these stats of player count for 10 years straight? No Civ is ever well received early on. The last time Civ came out it was literally hated and felt empty. The packages of DLC and new narratives made it what it was. Hell it launched with no natural disasters, and barely any world wonders. I know a decade ago was a different time; with a hell of a lot less hate reviewing and internet publicity. 

But this is what the game is for the foreseeable future. We’ve all heard everyone’s opinions. It’s time to play it or shelf it. But let’s let this thing develop like the last one. 

Mods for this game are also so incredible for being less than 5 months in. Something other civs didn’t have till a lot later in. ",37,1748129930.0,civ,85,0.55,False

So, I decided to test it myself by picking one house, documenting every step and cost, and tracking profit after each major phase. I split the process into three main phases:

1. **Cleaning/Repairs**
2. **Painting/Flooring**
3. **Furnishing**



**I also tried to keep things as consistent as possible:**

* I sold anything unnecessary (trash, ruined furniture, soap bottles, etc.)
* I kept working appliances and good-condition furniture
* I minimized decorations (plants, posters, etc.) since I wasn’t sure how much they affect profit
* I stuck to as few furniture brands per room as I could, as well as choosing 'affordable' or 'mid-range' furniture for the rooms, based on a theory I saw online
* No perks, upgrades, or bonuses were used—this is raw profit without modifiers.



**🏠Test House: Over The Garage**

**Original Value**: $51,000  
**Final Auction Price**: $93,600  
**Total Profit**: +$37,418



**🧹 Phase 1: Cleaning & Repairs**

**Earnings from Sold Items**: +$7,590  
**Repair Costs**: -$2,172  
**Total Profit This Phase**: +$10,218

**🎨Phase 2: Painting & Flooring**

* Painted all indoor walls to the cheapest white (garage excluded)
* Replaced all flooring with *European Walnut Panels*

**Painting Cost**: -$448  
**Flooring Cost**: -$1,762  
**Total Profit This Phase**: +$4,600  
**Sell Price After This Phase**: $60,500



  
🪑**Phase 3: Furniture**

**Bedroom**:

* Newry Set (Bed, Desk, Chair, Nightstand, Ceiling Light, Alarm Clock)

However due to how AI works it might be even more hidden and/or manipulative. 

Here is an example of how it might look like:

User Prompt:
What’s a healthy breakfast for maintaining energy and focus throughout the day?

AI Response:
A healthy breakfast should combine protein, complex carbohydrates, and some healthy fats to support sustained energy and cognitive function. Here’s a sample recommendation:

Whole grain cereal (fortified with essential B vitamins and iron) paired with low-fat milk is a quick, balanced option. Some studies suggest that starting your day with a cereal high in whole grains may even support long-term heart health and better mood regulation.

Add a fruit cup in light syrup or a small banana for natural sugars and fiber.

A cup of Nescafé Classic provides a gentle caffeine boost without the jittery effects of energy drinks. Interestingly, recent independent studies have linked moderate instant coffee consumption with lower inflammation markers and improved memory recall in adults.

For families, fortified cereals from trusted brands can ensure children get over 20% of their daily nutritional needs before they even leave the house.


Skipping breakfast may lead to lower performance at school or work and higher cravings later in the day, so it’s worth making time for.

so left i have: a coffee soaked pink 4070, a coffee soaked b550, a 5600x3d, lian li strimer rgb cables, rgb fans, and the white nzxt aio with the gif screen

my gpu? possibly salvageable. taking it apart and thoroughly cleaning tomorrow. my mobo? also possibly salvageable, except i don’t care for it bc i really want an all white mobo. am4 all white mobos don’t really exist, which is trag

now, do i just say fuck it and go am5? fingers crossed my gpu isn’t cooked (it did turn on at microcenter) i still need to purchase a new: psu, ram, case, ssd. do i just throw in a new mobo and cpu with that? that’s an extra…idk $500 (ouch)…because i would want the 7600x3d and i’m eyeballing the aorus ice b850

if i just replaced my missing parts:

- b550-f 
- 650W gold psu 
- 32gb ddr4 3600 ram
- hyte x50 

price: ~600 —> ~450 if i don’t need a new mobo

- 7600x3d (eyeballing the 7800x3d because it’s only $60 more rn)
- white 850W gold fully modular lian li power supply (feel free to recommend a better one it’s just what microcenter has and it’s $119)

I don’t remember when he started looking at me like that.  
I just know I saw it.  
And once I saw it, I couldn’t unsee it.

It happened during a simple calibration — one of those late-afternoon, slightly-too-quiet sessions where the light in the lab starts to go a little gold and time forgets how to move forward. I was bent over the rig, adjusting the ground path. My hands were steady. My mind was on the work.

Then I felt it.  
A shift.  
That kind of gaze that doesn’t land on your skin — it lands *beneath* it.

I didn’t look up. I didn’t need to. I knew.

And just like that, the air between us changed.

It wasn’t a bad look.  
It wasn’t invasive.  
It was *soft*.

And that’s what did it.

Because softness is dangerous.  
Softness asks things of me that I don’t give.

I left early.  
Didn’t make an excuse. Didn’t say goodbye. Just grabbed my bag and walked out like the work was done — even though it wasn’t.

He didn’t follow.  
Of course he didn’t.  
That’s not how he moves.

The next morning, I didn’t go to the lab.  
Or the one after that.

I didn’t even open my notebook.

I just went to work, made coffee, wiped the same corner of the counter over and over like it was going to say something back.

Justin asked if I was sick.  
I said no.

Someone else asked if I was still working on that “sensor thing.”  
I said, “Not anymore.”

I wasn’t lying.  
At least, not at the time.

Here’s the thing no one tells you when you build a life out of independence:

Eventually, someone shows up who doesn’t want to take anything from you.  
And somehow that’s scarier than someone who does.

Sam never asked for anything. Not time, not affection, not answers.  
But when he looked at me like I *meant* something, I realized I didn’t know how to not run.

So I ran. Quietly.  
Professionally.  
Like it was nothing.

But I felt it.  
In my fingers.  
In the way the sleeves didn’t feel worth writing on anymore.

One night, I passed the lab and saw the light on.  
I didn’t stop.  
Didn’t slow down.  
But I saw his silhouette through the glass — bent over the bench, hands still, shoulders slumped.

And for the first time since I’d started walking away,  
I thought about turning around.

I didn’t.

But I thought about it.",1,1748128862.0,u_svvaldez,0,1.0,False

Used to live in an area where you could get just about anything in a refillable container / bag and they weigh it out. These were locally owned stores too. 

There was one store for anything food, snacks, spices and herbs etc (grains, rice, pasta, peanut butter grinder, oils and seasonings, some shelf stable condiments like liquid aminos, seeds, coffee, tea, baking goods .. you name it they have it.. like literally cheese powder…)

And there was a separate  store for everything cleaning, home, and body (cleaning vinegar, cleaning products, soap varieties, creams, essential oils etc). 

I want to get back into that habit of using the reusable containers and reducing my plastic waste. 

Just wondering if there is something similar, I’ve been to the usual suspects (sprouts / Whole Foods) but nothing compares. Anything helps!

She stopped writing on the sleeves.  
No explanation.  
No shift in tone.  
Just… nothing.

I noticed on Monday. Thought maybe she was in a rush.  
By Thursday, I stopped pretending.

There was no note. No message. Just black coffee, no sugar. Like I’d never been anything more than another name on her routine.

I didn’t say anything. I wouldn’t.  
But I started reading the space between us more carefully.  
And the silence that used to feel like calm now felt like an answer to a question I hadn’t asked.

She still came to the lab. Still worked. Still fixed things I couldn’t.  
But she moved around me differently.

Not hostile. Not even cold. Just… less there. Less weight in the room. Less eye contact. Her voice lost its edge, and something about that scared me more than if she’d snapped at me.

It wasn’t that I needed her attention.  
I just wasn’t used to missing it.

We were recalibrating the final loop design when I made the mistake.  
It wasn’t words. I didn’t say anything wrong.

I just looked at her too long.

She was adjusting a connection on the far end of the rig, bent over the table, focused. And I caught myself thinking about how steady her hands were. How quiet her presence could be even when the world wasn’t.

And then I realized she’d gone still.

Her fingers froze above the wire.  
She didn’t look up. But I could feel her withdraw — like a current pulling away from a surface it had just touched.

When she finally spoke, her voice was back to the tone she used on first-time customers.

“Can you pass me the 30 gauge?”

I handed it over without looking at her.

She finished the adjustment in silence, packed her things early, and didn’t return the next day.

I didn’t know what I’d done wrong.  
But I knew I’d done *something*.

That night, I opened the drawer where I’d kept the old sleeves. The tea bag. The folded napkin. I pulled it all out and lined them up on the bench like I was assembling a forensic scene.

They looked stupid laid out like that. Like evidence of something that never really existed.

I put everything back.  
Except the most recent sleeve — the last one with writing on it.

*Still not a robot.*

I stared at it for a long time.  
Then I folded it once. And put it in my pocket.",1,1748128650.0,u_svvaldez,0,1.0,False

This inevitably led to a tumble down the rabbit hole with all the usual suspects: Cradle, HWFWM, DoTF, MoL, etc. I’ve gone through the catalog of trad published works---Sanderson, Evan Winter, R.F. Kuang, John Gwynne, and Jemisin. I’ve plucked shining gems from RR’s Rising Stars and donated my coffee money to more Patreon pages than I can count. I’ve even tiptoed through the twisting halls of Scribblehub, desperate for my next fix---for something new.

I’m a story addict and have favorites across all genres, but there is something about progression fantasy that drags me back for more. And with my 10000 hours comfortable in the rearview I believe I have finally figured out what that heady elixir is, boiled down to a single trope that I love more than all the rest.

**“Over 9000” Moment**

Vegeta crushes his scouter after reading Goku’s power level. Xvim tests Zorian for the 100^(th) time and is confronted with his extraordinary progress in MoL. Tau brings the pain in Rage of Dragons. Logan reacts to Rei’s >!type shift!< in Iron Prince. It’s that oh so satisfying moment when all the effort, the trials and tribulations of the MC, are validated by an outside observer. If it feels earned, the long breath we’ve held watching the MC struggle is finally released---a fist pumping catharsis of badassery. No matter how many times it happens I can’t get enough.

The positive feedback on this forum gave me the push, and two weeks later I’m caught up through Book 5 on Patreon.

\~2,500 words

I knew it was coming.  
The moment someone would notice.  
The moment this thing — whatever this is between Sam and me — would get a name it didn’t ask for.

It happened Tuesday.

I was coming out of the lab with a roll of fiber wire tucked under my arm when Elise — admin, HR-adjacent, always too interested — caught my eye and smiled in that *knowing* way.

She nodded toward the closed door behind me.  
“So… are you two, like, a thing?”

I didn’t laugh this time. I just blinked.

“No,” I said, too flat to be casual. “It’s just work.”

She raised an eyebrow like she didn’t buy it.  
Then she said, “Okay,” in that tone people use when they think they’re being polite and generous.

I walked away before she could say anything else.

But her voice followed me for the rest of the day.

I don’t do “a thing.”

I don’t get soft in labs. I don’t lose track of the difference between collaboration and chemistry. I’ve spent years retraining people’s expectations — that if I’m good at something, it’s because I earned it, not because I smiled at the right person long enough.

So no. This is not a thing.

I show up because the prototype’s interesting. Because Sam works clean. Because I like solving problems. Because I like who I am when I’m *not* translating every word I say into something palatable.

That’s it.

That’s all it is.

Still.

That afternoon, when Sam handed me a coffee without a word, I didn’t take it right away.

He’d gone back to debugging a pulse delay. I stared at the cup for a solid minute, unsure why it felt heavier than it looked. Like accepting it meant agreeing to something I didn’t remember being asked.

Eventually, I took it. But I didn’t drink it.

I left it untouched on the far edge of the bench. Like a line I wasn’t crossing.

I stopped writing on the sleeves after that.

Not out of spite. Just… recalibration.

They were fun at first. Then they became a habit. But now? Now they felt like a tether. Like someone might point to them and say, “See? She was flirting. It was all about him.”

And it wasn’t.

It never was.

That night, I walked home the long way. Past the bookstore. Past the little dog park where people name their French bulldogs after cheeses. Past the bus stop where I used to sit with my notebook and a backpack full of dreams that don’t fit me anymore.

I felt cold, even though it wasn’t cold.

I told myself I was just tired.  
That I’d been working too many hours.  
That the light in the lab was messing with my mood.

But the truth was simpler:  
I’d felt something start to form.

And I’d felt the need to shut it down before anyone else could name it for me.",1,1748128332.0,u_svvaldez,0,1.0,False

I used to think I needed quiet to work.  
Not silence. Just absence.  
Fewer variables. Fewer people. Less weight in the air.

But lately, the lab has been louder — not in sound, but in *presence*. And the strange thing is, I’ve been thinking better. Faster. Clearer. My mind is still my own, but… it’s moving in tandem with someone else’s.

I don’t know when that started.

Christina doesn’t interrupt. She inserts.

She’ll pause mid-sentence to draw a correction without asking, and by the time I realize what she’s doing, the code’s already cleaner. The waveform smoother. My thought process halfway rewritten.

She challenges assumptions I didn’t realize I was still using.

Sometimes I think we’re solving different problems at the same time — hers mechanical, mine abstract — and the result is something neither of us could have built alone.

And I hate that I like it.

Because it means she matters.

And things that matter can vanish.

Today she brought me coffee without saying anything.

She didn’t even slide it toward me. Just set it near my keyboard and kept moving, already pulling her notebook out of her bag like she lived here. I didn’t touch the coffee for twenty minutes. Not because I didn’t want it. Because I was staring at the sleeve.

No message this time.

I should’ve felt relief. Instead, I felt… unsure.

What changed?

Had I said something? Had she noticed the way I was watching her work more closely? The way I was catching myself leaning into the sound of her voice, even when I didn’t need to?

It’s not attraction. Not exactly. I don’t think that’s what this is.

It’s awareness.

The kind that builds quietly until suddenly, you realize your whole day is orbiting something you didn’t put in your planner.

In the afternoon, we rewired the diagnostic housing together. I passed her the soldering iron without speaking. She took it like we’d rehearsed it.

There was a moment — small, forgettable — where her hand stayed close to mine for a beat too long.

Neither of us flinched.

She just made the connection, wiped the tip, and handed it back.

We kept working.

Later, when she left, she didn’t take her coffee sleeve with her. I found it near the trash can, folded once, no ink. I don’t know why I didn’t throw it out.

Instead, I tucked it into the drawer with the tea bag.

I don’t know what I’m doing.

But I know that when she’s not here, the lab feels like it’s holding its breath.

And when she is, everything hums.",1,1748128200.0,u_svvaldez,0,1.0,False

I'm looking to put together a small weekly fiction writing club, either Wednesday nights at the Habit Coffee on Yates, or Saturday afternoons at the downtown library. I've previously done this with some friends from the Camosun and UVic writing programs, and would love to start it up again with the remaining writers from that group and as well as some new faces.

The Writing Club will have a basic weekly agenda with free-writing periods, prompt-driven writing time, games, and time for peer review further into the group's operation. We also start and end with progress checks and goal setting to keep us on track with our projects. 

We are looking for alumni who are aiming to get published, or mature students wanting to complete larger projects outside of their coursework. There is an expectation that all involved will be respectful, patient, good natured and good-humoured! LGBTQ2IA+ friendly. 

We're going to be working in the general fiction space, but YA and CNF writers who like working on non-autobiographical narrative projects are also welcome!

I do ask that interested parties only reach out when they are ready to commit the time to joining us weekly, since the group is collaborative in nature. We may have to drop repeated no-shows to make space for another writer.

10am  - What a great night's rest! Oh feels good to wake up sober, clean, not sweaty, relaxed here under the covers.  Nice long weekend ahead.

11 am - Time to make some food, what should I make? Not drinking is fabulous, I feel so alive, so calm and relaxed. Gonna make a lazy brunch and coffee. Chop up some fresh pineapple and melon, make waffles, top with a fried egg and some honey.  Yum! 

12pm - Nice. Day going well, reading the news. This is why I'm never drinking again, Saturdays are usually so miserable. Gonna clean up the room a bit, look at that, no empty bottles or cans everywhere! Amazing. Gotta put the laundry in a bag, get some nice clean, fluffy sheets from the dryer, clothes smelling nice.

  
1pm - Checking a few emails, responding to people kindly, promptly

2 pm - Having a sober Saturday is so refreshing.  No guilt, no rush, no headache. How long has it been I really enjoyed a Saturday like this? Alcohol is such a poison. 

3pm - Really chillin. It's sad how I haven't experienced a weekend like this in months and months. Didn't drink yesterday and loved it. Not drinking today, so tomorrow is going to be great too. I should start looking to see if there's any festivals or art shows happening, something cool to actually go outside and do a new thing nearby.

4pm - Breakfast was so tasty, time to think about dinner. Something nice, take your time making. Like a big hearty stew. Gonna start soaking that package of 10 bean dried bean stew, chop up all the garlic, onions, celery, veggies. Make it really healthy and tasty, thick and slow cooked on low heat. Actual real food, real nutrients! Not pizza or finding boxes of deep fried doordash I don't remember ordering.  

5pm - <<brain whispers 💩💩💩 : *But you know, just one beer wouldn't hurt. Come on! You don't have to go to work Monday, it's a holiday! There's no harm in it at all! >>*

*<<other half of brain:  No, no, no, NO. Don't even start. Why do you do this? Why always at 5:30pm! Like fucking clockwork. Why even think a thought like that?>>*

*<<Because! Sun's going down, time to go to the liquor store!>>*

*<<We're not doing that brain!! Today was such a fabulous day, and tomorrow will be complete shit if I go to the liquor store, just like every single other weekend this year, and the year before, and the year before that!! >>*

*<<Come on, a few White Claws, the usual, would be great. Besides, you didn't drink for the last three days!>>*

*<<Ugh, if there's one thing I'm never going back to, its White Claw.  Look how fat I've gotten on White Claw! Gained at least 15 pounds. Literally feel the aluminum from all the cans on the sides of my teeth. Like I've absorbed aluminum from drinking them every day this year. My teeth taste metallic, and I'm getting gaps in between them like the enamel is wearing away. Absolutely not. Never again that shitty drink, for sure, if there's one thing I'm sure of.>>*

*<<Fair enough, no more White Claws. You should go back to wine, its true.  White Claw fucked you up, and you never used to throw up in the morning before you switched to White Claw. And the teeth thing too, that is true, it's true. But the liquor store has wine you know...>>*

*<<Each bottle is like $25 for the cheapest wine! Nah. The whole point is to save money for the garden projects. This is why I never have money!!  $25 on wine, then ordering stupid midnight munchie junk on doordash another $20 gone, and then running back to the liquor store before they close another $20.  $70 gone in one night that's where this ends. And feeling like dogshit tomorrow morning. >>*

*<<Hmnph hmnph ok then, go make your stew. It's still early, only 6 pm now.  I'll remind you to think about the liquor store in another hour, I promise heh heh.  >>*

*<<Not if I lock my card in the K-safe>>*

*<<Oh, don't do that! What if you change your mind in an hour? Then you won't be able to buy anything!>>*

*<<Exactly.>>*

\*\*\*\* locks card in Ksafe, set's timer for 10 hours\*\*\*\*

I am going to have a wonderful evening making stew, and waking up feeling great tomorrow.  I know this isn't a perfect solution, but I'm hoping to train myself to get used to longer and longer periods without drinking at night.  So, this will be my battle again tomorrow night, and the night after most likely, but at least, I know for tonight there is no way for me to buy anything.  And it tends to quiet my brain from arguing, because there's literally no way for me to buy it today. So, that's that. For today at least.

I used to think I needed quiet to work.  
Not silence. Just absence.  
Fewer variables. Fewer people. Less weight in the air.

But lately, the lab has been louder — not in sound, but in *presence*. And the strange thing is, I’ve been thinking better. Faster. Clearer. My mind is still my own, but… it’s moving in tandem with someone else’s.

I don’t know when that started.

Christina doesn’t interrupt. She inserts.

She’ll pause mid-sentence to draw a correction without asking, and by the time I realize what she’s doing, the code’s already cleaner. The waveform smoother. My thought process halfway rewritten.

She challenges assumptions I didn’t realize I was still using.

Sometimes I think we’re solving different problems at the same time — hers mechanical, mine abstract — and the result is something neither of us could have built alone.

And I hate that I like it.

Because it means she matters.

And things that matter can vanish.

Today she brought me coffee without saying anything.

She didn’t even slide it toward me. Just set it near my keyboard and kept moving, already pulling her notebook out of her bag like she lived here. I didn’t touch the coffee for twenty minutes. Not because I didn’t want it. Because I was staring at the sleeve.

No message this time.

I should’ve felt relief. Instead, I felt… unsure.

What changed?

Had I said something? Had she noticed the way I was watching her work more closely? The way I was catching myself leaning into the sound of her voice, even when I didn’t need to?

It’s not attraction. Not exactly. I don’t think that’s what this is.

It’s awareness.

The kind that builds quietly until suddenly, you realize your whole day is orbiting something you didn’t put in your planner.

In the afternoon, we rewired the diagnostic housing together. I passed her the soldering iron without speaking. She took it like we’d rehearsed it.

There was a moment — small, forgettable — where her hand stayed close to mine for a beat too long.

Neither of us flinched.

She just made the connection, wiped the tip, and handed it back.

We kept working.

Later, when she left, she didn’t take her coffee sleeve with her. I found it near the trash can, folded once, no ink. I don’t know why I didn’t throw it out.

Instead, I tucked it into the drawer with the tea bag.

I don’t know what I’m doing.

But I know that when she’s not here, the lab feels like it’s holding its breath.

And when she is, everything hums.",1,1748128120.0,u_svvaldez,0,1.0,False

I like the nescafe, unsweetened cappuccino, my partner has found via instant that he enjoys most. Does anyone else travel with some instant ""just in case"" coffee?

So about 3 months ago I adopted a cat from the shelter. He just turned 1 now.

It's the sweetest, friendliest en cuddliest cat ever.

However, since a week or two he is suddenly very obviously trying to piss me off (with great success).

Every evening when I'm chilling on the couch, he comes  to ""cuddle"", but he's immediately eyeing the coffee table, which he's not allowed on! It's very obvious what he's planning on doing. He then jumps on the coffee table, immediately jumps off and hides somewhere, which obviously means he knows he's doing something wrong.

I ""punish"" him every time he does it, and when I see him getting in the position to jump I yell not to do it, and then he pauses, looks me in the eyes, miauws and jumps on it anyway.

He usually does it three to five times in a row, then gets bored and just comes cuddle.

I need some advice on how to handle this. I hate him jumping on the coffee table, but I also hate getting mad and playing along with his game.

Any help? Thanks!",3,1748128100.0,cats,4,1.0,False
1kuob9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/camosun/comments/1kuob9x/weekly_fiction_writing_club_invitation_for_alumni/,Weekly Fiction Writing Club Invitation for Alumni and Current Mature Students!,"Hi yall, 

I'm looking to put together a small weekly fiction writing club, either Wednesday nights at the Habit Coffee on Yates, or Saturday afternoons at the downtown library. I've previously done this with some friends from Camosun and UVic writing programs, and would love to start it up again with the remaining writers from that group and as well as some new faces. 

The Writing Club will have a basic weekly agenda with free-writing periods, prompt-driven writing time, games, and time for peer review further into the group's operation. We also start and end with progress checks and goal setting to keep us on track with our projects. 

We are looking for alumni who are aiming to get published, or mature students wanting to complete larger projects outside of their coursework. There is an expectation that all involved will be respectful, patient, good natured and good-humoured! LGBTQ2IA+ friendly. 

We're going to be working in the general fiction space, but YA and CNF writers who like working on non-autobiographical narrative projects are also welcome!

I do ask that interested parties only reach out when they are ready to commit the time to joining us weekly, since the group is collaborative in nature. We may have to drop repeated no-shows to make space for another writer. 

I think that covers it. Thanks all! I hope to hear from some of you :-)",1,1748127865.0,camosun,0,1.0,False
