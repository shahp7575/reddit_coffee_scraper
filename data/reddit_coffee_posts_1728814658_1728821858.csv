1g2obw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1g2obw8/i_always_wake_up_minutes_before_my_mother_wakes/,"I always wake up minutes before my mother wakes me (unscheduled routine, different times each day).","This is a long one. You've been warned.

Recently I got prescribed a valerian-based pill (in addition to Sertraline, which I've been taking for a while). I'm a very anxious person and my family setting is a mess. My mother has Borderline Personality Disorder and that often gets in the way of us getting along, as we have very different reactions and opinions on mundane things.

That's just to say that, whenever I noticed this was happening, I immediately thought to myself ""Maybe I'm just stressed, maybe I can somehow hear her moving around the house"". But here's another piece of context.

My bedroom is the only room on the second floor. It's a strange house. You have to walk across the backyard (which isn't that large, really) and up the stairs to find my door and a tiny balcony. So my bedroom is practically out in the open and higher than the rest of the house, but it's all the same building. I can barely hear anything from downstairs when I'm in my room, and vice versa. If neither I or my mother feel like going up/down the stairs to communicate, we'll just call each other's phones instead. That's how isolated we are from each other, sound wise.

It's been a week since I've started taking the valerian-based medicine, which is around the time I noticed this was happening. I'm on a gap year and have no real need to wake up early (save for medical appointments, vet visits, you get it). Sometimes I'll sleep the day off, sometimes I'll be awake by 6am, it really depends.

Despite the lack of routine, if I wake up, say, at 8 in the morning, my mother is surely going to call me at around 8:20. If I wake up at 3pm, even if I try to go back to sleep, I'll startle myself awake with the ringtone roughly half an hour later. I'm not a light sleeper by any means and, as mentioned previously, I can't hear anything from downstairs. If she moves around, uses the restroom, whips up some coffee, I can't hear it because of how distant my bedroom is.

Thanks to her medication, my mother also has a very irregular sleep routine, sometimes sleeping the entire day. So, no, I have no means of predicting at which time she'll wake up and call me. Even when she does wake up early, she'll certainly spend HOURS browsing social media before actually getting out of bed.

So how come I always startle myself awake every single day, like clockwork, 5~40 minutes before my mother calls me, if neither of us have a steady routine? I've considered that this might be a trauma response, but the irregular routine just makes it unlikely that my brain will just guess ""oh, she might wake us up in X minutes"". Does anyone have similar experiences?",1,1728821767.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False
1g2oa53,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g2oa53/apartment_for_rent_enquire_within/,Apartment for rent. Enquire within!,"I always liked having my own space. I’d had my fair share of experience with cramped dorms and messy, inconsiderate roommates. It wasn’t for me. So when I found a small, ground-floor apartment near campus, I didn’t hesitate. It wasn’t fancy, but it had everything I needed. Quiet, private, and fairly cheap—perfect for my last year of university.


Everything was good—until the neighbors started complaining.


It began with Mrs. Reed from next door, catching me in the hallway one morning. She looked tired, her eyes heavy with bags.


“Are you having late-night parties?” she asked, her voice sharper than usual.


I blinked, confused. “*No?* I go to bed at 10.”


She shook her head, a deep frown settling into her jowls. “I hear music. Laughing, banging on the walls. You should be more considerate.”


I hadn’t heard a thing. “I’m sorry, but it’s not me. I promise.”


She squinted at me like she didn’t believe a word I said. *“Just keep it down.”*


Nights were quiet on my end. I didn’t throw parties or invite friends over, I’m a bit of a recluse, honestly. I barely left the apartment, aside from classes or library runs. Still, the complaints didn’t stop. More neighbors started approaching me in the hallways, their faces drawn and annoyed, asking about the noise. To keep it down. 


The thing is though, every night I slept like a rock. **Nothing** woke me up. **Nothing** ever stirred. I tried staying up one night to catch the sound, but I was too exhausted. I wasn’t going to sacrifice my sleep for something I *knew* I wasn’t contributing to, so I passed out around 11p.m. with no disturbances. 


One evening, after a long day of studying at the library, I came home to find a note slipped under the door. It was crumpled and hastily written: “Noise complaints. Handle it.” Next to it, bizarrely enough, was a chocolate bar wrapper. A small amount of slick, melted chocolate still inside. The letter itself smeared in it. 


I was pissed tbh. *What the hell?* It wasn’t even me making the noise, and *why?* Why stuff your own trash along with the letter?  Frustrated and tired, I tossed the note on the counter and the wrapper in the trash. Then, I collapsed into bed and fell into a study-induced coma.


That was the night things started going missing.


At first, it was small stuff—pens, keys, a sock here or there. The usual, nothing suspicious. They always turned up, but never where I left them. I figured it was stress; finals were around the corner, and I was so drowsy all the time. I chalked it up to forgetfulness.


Then one morning, I found my toothbrush sitting on the coffee table. It was damp, *tinged brown.* The odd thing? I hadn’t brushed my teeth yet. I knew I hadn’t. I still had morning breath. 


I started to wonder if I was sleepwalking. Could I have been getting up in the middle of the night, moving things without realizing it? Making loud noises? I considered having a friend stay over to keep an eye on me, but that felt… extreme? 


I finally got my answer a week later, at a point where I was being threatened with eviction due to these unexplained noise complaints. I noticed a panel in the base of my closet was... ajar? I froze. The base always looked solid before, nothing loose. Curiosity got the better of me, sliding it open some more and being met with a stale, cool breeze rising up from below. Stupid I know, but I peaked my head in, discovering a crawlspace. 


It couldn’t be more than three feet high, dank and covered in thick dusty cobwebs. Scattered throughout the space were chocolate bar wrappers. It smelt like mould and *sickly sweetness.*


I guess I was naive. I assumed I’d find some wily raccoons, a stray cat. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and peered further in. There were several cushions steeped in mould, discarded soda cans, more chocolate bar wrappers. It smelt of sugar and rank air. No scratching, no animal sounds.


But deeper into the darkness, *I saw them.* Four pairs of eyes, squinting from the light I brought in with me. As my eyes settled. I realised what was staring back at me. 


Two children sat cross-legged on the floor. They were pale, gaunt, with dark circles under their eyes. But their knees rocked with giddy excitement, their smiles smeared with chocolate. The boy let out a small giggle as his eyes met mine. 


Slumped against the left side was a woman. Her face was blank, her eyes unfocused. Staring at everything; and nothing, in particular. 


And in the far corner, drenched in darkness, was a man. Hunched on all fours, watching me intently with a calm expression. 


*“You’re finally here,”* his voice was soft, with a hint of malice. 


He gestured toward the children, who were still giggling.  *“The kids love playing at night. Apologies, they can get a little loud.”*


He smirked. A small, controlled smile. From his pocket he revealed a tiny glass bottle. *“I’ve been helping you though. You’re a sound sleeper when you’re… properly dosed.”*


My blood ran cold as the cramped, rank space I peaked my head into began to spin. “...You’ve been drugging me?” 


He shrugged, nonchalant, then gestured toward the woman slumped in the corner. *“My wife doesn’t talk much these days, but she enjoys the company.”*


The woman didn’t react to bring addressed. 


Something *cold* brushed against my hand. The little girl was crouched next to me, her fingers icy as she tugged at my fingers. Her eyes wide as she stared up at me, her smile never fading. “Wanna play?”


I scrambled backwards, out of the crawlspace before slumping back in a daze. My limbs felt like lead, my vision blurry. I heard the children let out disappointed cries, as the man’s face peaked out of the crawlspace, half hidden in shadow. 

*“Don’t worry,”* he whispered, his voice dripping with menace. *“You’ll love it here. We all do. Don’t we, kids?”*


High-pitched cheers echoed out. 


That’s the last thing I remember. The sound of happy children, and the man’s toothy grin rearing up from underneath. 


---


And do you know what? He wasn’t wrong. 


A difficult transition, as all things are. Didn’t sleep the first week, now I sleep all day. Probably sugar crashing tbh. 


Now, I love it here. I’ve grown fond of the kids and their games. I’ve come to learn the “wife” is called Margaret, and she isn’t officially his wife. Sometimes her eyes follow me and she’ll mumble something incoherent. Like she has something to tell me, but it comes out twisted. Generally she’s quiet, but I enjoy her company.


Mrs. Reed doesn’t complain anymore. In fact, I haven’t seen her in days. 


I’m sure she’ll understand eventually. Just like I did.


Anyway, the apartment’s finally prepped for a new tenant. $550pm, a really **great bargain** in this area! Especially with such... quiet neighbors. **Enquire Below!**


*We can’t wait to meet you!*

1g2o9jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g2o9jk/aitah_for_refusing_to_help_my_sister_financially/,AITAH for refusing to help my sister financially after she cut me off for years?,"I (32F) grew up with a close-knit family, especially with my older sister Anna (36F). We were inseparable throughout our childhood and teenage years. Anna was always my protector, my confidante, and my best friend. When our parents divorced when I was 15, it was Anna who helped me through it. She was my rock, and I thought nothing could ever come between us. We shared everything, and I looked up to her in so many ways.

However, things started to change when Anna met Mike (37M). Mike seemed nice at first, but over time, I noticed a shift. He was always a bit controlling, and he didn’t seem to like me very much. At family gatherings, he’d make passive-aggressive comments about my lifestyle or career choices. When I was in college, studying art and design, he’d always mock my “useless degree,” saying I’d never make a living off it. Anna would laugh along or say nothing, and I figured she just didn’t want to get involved.

After they got married about 10 years ago, it became clear that Mike wanted to separate Anna from her family. He didn’t outright say it, but little things piled up. Suddenly, they were too busy to meet up, and Anna stopped answering my texts and calls as frequently. At first, I thought maybe they were just adjusting to married life. But over the years, it became more and more evident that Anna was drifting away. I’d invite her to coffee, to family dinners, to anything, and she’d always have an excuse—“I’m busy,” “Mike and I are working through some things,” “Maybe next time.”

About five years ago, Anna just stopped communicating altogether. No explanation. No fight. Just silence. I was devastated. I tried reaching out several times, leaving voicemails and sending messages, but nothing. It was like she vanished from my life. I eventually stopped trying because it was too painful. I’d hear updates about her through our mom, but even my parents had minimal contact with her.

During this time, I worked hard to build my career. Despite Mike’s dismissive attitude toward my degree, I actually did really well in the design field. I started my own business, which grew quickly, and I’m now financially stable. I’m not rich, but I’m comfortable, and I’ve been proud of the life I’ve built for myself.

Then, about two months ago, out of the blue, Anna called me. I was shocked but happy to hear from her. For a brief moment, I thought maybe she wanted to reconnect, to apologize, or at least explain why she cut me off for all those years. But the conversation quickly turned into something else. Anna and Mike were having serious financial problems. Mike had lost his job, and they were struggling to pay their mortgage and bills. She said they’d tried getting help from other family members, but no one could afford to help them out.

Anna asked me for a loan, not a small one either—she was talking thousands of dollars. She said they were desperate, and if they didn’t get help soon, they could lose their house. I told her I needed time to think about it and hung up.

Honestly, I felt conflicted. On one hand, she’s my sister, and I know she’s in a tough spot. On the other hand, I can’t ignore the fact that she abandoned me when I needed her the most. For years, she acted like I didn’t exist, and now the only reason she’s talking to me is because she needs money? I couldn't help but feel used. It hurt that there was no apology or acknowledgment of what she’d done. It was all about her problems and what I could do for her.

I talked to some friends about it, and opinions were mixed. Some said, ""She’s family, you should help her, even if she was distant before."" Others told me that I shouldn’t feel obligated to bail her out, especially considering how she treated me for all those years. One of my close friends pointed out that helping her financially might not even fix the problem if Mike is still in control of their decisions.

After thinking it over for a few days, I called Anna back and told her that I wasn’t comfortable lending her the money, especially since we hadn’t been in contact for so long. I told her that I was hurt by the way she cut me out of her life, and it didn’t feel right for me to just jump in now and help when she hadn’t shown any interest in maintaining our relationship.

Anna didn’t take it well. She said I was being petty and vindictive. She accused me of punishing her for something that happened years ago and said I was letting her family suffer just to “prove a point.” She even said that I was lucky to be in a good financial position and that I didn’t understand what it was like to struggle. That hurt the most, because I’ve had my fair share of struggles, too, but I’ve worked hard to get where I am.

Now, my parents are involved. They think I should help Anna, even if it’s just a loan. They say she’s still my sister and that family should come first. But I can’t shake the feeling that if I give her the money, I’m just enabling the same behavior that led her to cut me off in the first place. I don’t know if I’ll ever see that money again, and part of me feels like she’ll go back to ignoring me once they’re financially stable again.",2,1728821543.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

My starting weight was 117kg, and have been loosing an average 0.5kg loss per week. 

Former couch potato, I never thought I’d say I am enjoying going to the gym, and I have to say a lot of it is down to my PT. I am currently going to the gym twice per week for PT led sessions (learning how to exercise correctly with weights/machines), and trying to consistently hit 8-10k steps (which can be challenging when I work a desk job 50/60h per week, and mainly from home) so over the last week I started adding treadmill walks in the morning/evening to get that step count higher.

Diet-wise, whilst I am not on a specific/restrictive diet, I am more mindful of what I eat - no more snacking in front of the screen/tv or going through a bar of chocolate in one sitting. 

Majority of my meals are home cooked - I cook and bake a lot, with maybe a takeaway once per week. I was hoping there is an app or calculator that could estimate calories and maybe macros for home cooked meals, so I can keep an accurate log (more than coffee for breakfast, omelet for lunch, and roast beef for supper). 

I am happy with the progress, and whilst I know that steady pace wins the race and accept that I can’t undo years of indulgence and no exercise in a short timeframe, I am wondering if there is something I am missing/I could do better to ensure success and a sustainable change?

Any app recommendations or thoughts on how I can improve would be greatly appreciated!",1,1728821396.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

1g2o5yd,https://i.redd.it/8qvzoqaykiud1.jpeg,Kespor GX-T review,"There are very few reviews of this bike online so I decided to make one after owning it for a little more than a week and using it for commutes and leisurely rides. I bought this bike as my ""low-maintenace"" bike as I find it cumbersome sending my trusty mountain bike to a bike shop for a fork service every 25-30hrs of riding, and I want to try dropbar bikes for a change. This is my first dropbar bike, so it took me a weekend of getting used to before I finally went fast with it. This will be a long read so go grab a cup of coffee while you're at it.

The frameset: 
Obviously, it's titanium. It wasn't specified what kind of titanium material was used but considering the price, it's probably something like a Grade 9 titanium than the aerospace variants used by bigger brands like Lynskey. I went with the size 49 according to my recommended reach I like the brushed titanium finish on this one as it looks good without being too much of a standout(although I still get the looks while I pass by). The downside though, is that it's a fingerprint magnet so make sure you don't have pily/sweaty hands when holding it. The frame also has a lot of mounting points for any kind of bikepacking set-up that you want. But be wary of those bolts. Apply grease and make sure they're tight to avoid losing them during rides. 
As for the fork, it's made of T800 carbon. My only gripe with the fork is it was already scratched at the bottom upon my purchase. I sent it back for a bike skin so I'm hoping it wouldn't become a failure point in the future.

The cockpit: 
Kespor used their in-house Machine 11 components on this bike. The seatclamp, seatpost, stem, and dropbars are all aluminium. Will definitely replace the seatpost and clamp with titanium to avoid chemical welds/seizing in the future.
Regarding the dropbars, I used to complain that there's not enough flare but upon using it, I realized that I don't need that much flare since I'll only used it mostly on paved roads and occasional gravel/singletrack. As for the bartape, this is my first major complaint. For a lack of a better term, it's shit. It's thin and doesn't give you comfort except a bit on the tops. 
For the saddle, it comes with a Selle Royal Seta. I immediately replaced it with my ZTTO titanium saddle after my first ride. The stock saddle was good to pedal with since it doesn't hinder your legs, but I think it's better suited for female riders unless you have a fetish of having your testicles tortured while riding.

The wheelset:
700c 24H Machine 11 rims laced with steel spokes on Sagmit M150 6-pawl centerlock hubs. I was surprised the Sagmit have centerlock hubs. They're alright. Nothing special.  I personally prefer ratchet hubs since they're silent and tuneable in terms of engagement. I would've probably hated the noisy Sagmit hub if it didn't sound like Perry the Platypus during slow freewheeling. Lol
About the tires. The GX-T comes stock with Continental Terra Trail 700x40c but they're wited so I immediately swapped it for a pair of Maxxis Velocitas of the same width for a tubeless setup. Nothing wrong with the Terra Trails, I've heard good things about those tires. It's just that they're wired and heavy.

The groupset: 
The second main selling point of this bike aside from the frame. It's almost a full GRX 1x11 groupset but they decided to go with KMC X11 for the chain(which I prefer since I had a bad experience with Shimano XT chains on my mountain bike) and Ferrino centerlock rotors. This is where my second major complaint is. The Kespor GX-T comes stock with 175mm cranks on all sizes. If you have long legs and felxible hips like I do, this won't be much of a problem as long as you have the correct but I find it awkward to pedal with these cranks since I'm used to 165-170mm cranks on my mountain bikes. I don't like the long pedal stroke since it forces me sway more on the saddle and even my hips get tired after an hour of bike commute with it.

The ride feel + my current setup: 
The only things I replaced on the bike were the saddle to match my ass and the tires for a tubeless set-up. Everything else are still stock. I went with flat pedals, the Weapon Beast( I know, Weapon is crap as a brand but I find their pedals pretty good for the price especially the Savage. Just stay away from the Demon) until I finally decide to go full-on cleats. I also maxed the psi on my tires to check how long it'll take before the tire loses pressure.
The bike performs as expected for a titanium gravel bike with endurance geometry somewhat akin to a road bike. At first I was concerned that the alloy seatpost might negate the dampening properties of the titanium frame but fortunately that wasn't the case. The ride is not as harsh as the Atomic road bike I tried back then but not as supple as my mountain bike. Steering is very responsive for a dropbar bike thanks to the 70mm stem. I was worried about the carbon fork snapping but it's still in one piece with no cracks after surviving multiple surprise potholes courtesy of DPWH. I can't fault the frame for any body aches I've encountered while riding this bike. For now, I bought gel-padded gloves to prevent myself from getting numb hands after riding. As for speed, the GX-T is not that fast on its stock gearing. It's equipped with a 40t chainring partnered with 11-42t 11-speed cassette. Personally, I find it lacking since I'm used to 38t/10-51t 12-speed gearing on my mountain bikes. The long cranks may have contributed to its slow acceleration. On the bright side, pedalling uphill is a breeze.

Conclusion:
I used to drool over 3 dropbar bikes. This bike reminds me of those three: The Titanium Lynskey gravel bike, the similar sizing of the Colnago C68, and the versatility of the Enve Fray. I'm very happy owning this bike despite the flaws that it comes with. I can easily understand why some parts are there since they're probably cost-cutting in some corners jsut to deliver this titanium bike at such an affordable price, but with a simple parts swap albeit an additional expense, you can build your Ul-Ti-mate  gravel bike off of this without breaking the bank too much. As for durability, it's holding up pretty well but we still can't say how long it'll lastd. Regardless, this will be my first and last gravel bike unless it breaks on me.

Pros:
+ Affordable price.
+ GRX 1x11 groupset without much compromise.
+ Loud hubs also functions as a warning device and a Perry the Platypus impersonation. 
+ Easy maintenance, easy to clean
+ Endurance geometry
+ Lots of mounting points. Perfect for bikepacking adventures.
+ Thankfully, no toe overlap.

Cons:
- Still a fingerprint magnet despite the brushed titanium finish.
- 175mm cranks are not for everyone. In some cases, it causes your heels to come in contact with the chainstays.
- Stock saddle has a knack for torturing people with testicles.

We already had a bunch of deep conversations and we really connected. ( I live in German, he lives in Netherlands.) Our first date, was the best date of my life. His also. We stayed together in a hotel. Came back the next day. It had romance, great laghs, we ate, talked a lot and in the end also great sex. Next morning, we went for a ride, then for coffee and then we returned home. The connection we had in every area, i think not many people meet that in their lifes. I was always 100% myself, and he was also. We kept talking everyday and we met around once a week for almost 3 months. Then i went on vacation to my homeland and we didn't meet for 3 weeks. I understood there that i was really missing him. I was falling for him so hard and fast. I came back, we met. Even when I couldn't have sex, we met. He started something personal stuff with his apartment and got busy. Still, he always included me to his decisions and we never stopped talking. After a while I started freaking out because of the distance. One day we met, had a great date and the next morning i told him everything. That i was in love, i miss him everyday and that we should stop meeting before it gets ugly. He told me he doesn't want, but its realistic and if that's what's best for me, okay! I couldn't go through with it though. 5 days later i told him that i would like to give it a try no matter how it turns out! He agreed. 2 weeks after, we met. All these days, he also started a process on buying a house. So he was pretty broke. Me also. But we were managing. On our last date, we started talking about me freaking out, us generally dating other people. He told me that this is going to get ugly and we're going to freak out with the distance! Head back to the hotel. He almost had a panick attack that night. We went out for a smoke to calm down. At some point he turned and told me we should stop meeting indeed. We're already developing feelings, we need more of eachother in the day. That's not enough. It was like we were in a relationship, but we were not, but we wanted!! And one of us must change completely his life for this to work and we're not there. Neither of us. We're in a weird place in our lives. We talked a lot, said all the truths, expressed our feelings.

I feel a bit liberated, leaving a situation that would possibly drive me crazy but i miss him so much. It's like something is missing from my life. I feel empty. I don't want to date another guy, not even meet one and i don't want to forget him. I don't think I'll even have that kind of a connection again. It's also the same for him!

Height is 173cm and weight is 120kg. yeah i'm fat as hell now. I have been starting gym and diet lately.

For daily calories intake, I try to keep under 2000 cals, roughly about 1000 to 1800 each day. I dont really eat any sugary products or food. At most, just black coffee with reduced sugar (it's instant prepackage) and mostly 2 cups per day. That's all for my sugary food or drinks.

For my workout, I do some lifting and cardio. I'm not really hardcore going full on weights to build muscle. My main goal is to lose weight first and was hoping the muscle gains are going to be just by products.

About 3kms of high incline treadmills with the calories burned on the treadmill showing 240 calories total. My gym session is about 1 hour+ daily.  I have no idea how much calories i burn from the weights, i dont think it's that high. Im targeting mainly upper body for the muscle building. I gym 5 times a week with 1 rest day.

I ordered an avocado toast, which was just a single slice of sourdough with avocado for around $17-$18. I also got an additional hash brown (for an extra $4-5) that smelled off? 

Like the oil used was old af? The toast was poorly cooked too, it looked like it was just thrown on a hot pan without proper toasting so like the bottom was “toasted” but like not really? And the bread tasted stale!

When I mentioned this to the waiter, she took the plate but seemed to roll her eyes at me, making me uncomfortable. As she went to the kitchen, I saw the staff rolling their eyes and pointing, which felt incredibly rude. After waiting 20-35 minutes with no updates, I asked for a refund. The same waiter then told me they were making a new dish, but by that point, I was just done and wanted to go home. When I told her it was fine, I just wanted a refund, she rolled her eyes again.

I usually don’t send food back, but this situation felt unacceptable. For the price, I expected much better quality and service. I have a medical condition that requires me to eat shortly after taking my meds (which they didn’t know ofc and like not their fault that I have this thing), but their behavior made me feel self-conscious. I ended up not eating anything for the whole day, and their reactions felt like mockery of my body as I am plus sized.

1g2nyag,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g2nyag/adult_adhd_vs_mci_tell_me_im_just_paranoid/,Adult ADHD vs MCI - tell me I'm just paranoid ,"Demographic: 34M, white, 68"", 165#, married, no kids

Current diagnoses: adult ADHD (diagnosed 14 months ago), adult onset congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (diagnosed in January). Currently under evaluation for ASD.

Current medications: Atomoxetine 40mg and Bupropion 300mg, taken in the morning, for ADHD. 

Recreational medications: EtOH 1 drink (one beer or one glass of Brandy or bourbon) three times a week. Marijuana (legal state) either from a resin pen or in edible form, purchased from a licensed distributor, maybe twice a month. Smoker for 12 years, 2 packs a day when I was at my worst but actively trying to quit for the past couple of years; currently down to one disposable vape every 2 weeks. 

Yeah, I know how that title sounds. I'll try to be detailed. I'm typing this on my phone, so I apologize in advance for formatting and spelling issues.

For about 6 years now, I have found my conscious self gradually feeling more detached from what my body is doing. I've felt more and more like I'm on autopilot, I space out more often, apathy has been gradually increasing, I've been anhedonic and emotionally numb in increasing consistency.

My memory has been spotty at times. I'll stare into space (and it feels really good to just space out like that, almost like sleeping), sometimes just because I feel like I need to do that, other times it just happens. Anxiety is increasing - I had my first anxiety attack last month - and paranoia as well. 

I'm doing increasingly worse in public spaces, either feeling lost (when I previously have been the person my friends and family looked to for sense of direction) or inordinately irate.

My reading comprehension is declining and my analytical ability is suffering, which is becoming increasingly frustrating because I have built my career on my ability to analyze and problem solve more thoroughly and effectively than my peers. I'll be given a data set similar to what I typically work with, and I'll just be totally lost looking at it.

Physically, I feel stiffer, but less in an age related way and more like my muscles feel like bungee straps that have been frosted over. Sometimes I am as strong as ever, sometimes I struggle to lift my laptop. If I try to work out or do a strenuous activity, I very quickly overheat and find myself out of breath; 4 years ago I was a combat medic in the reserves, physically exerting myself more strenuously and for longer periods of time than most other people, and had no problem with it. 

I have gradually spent less and less time on fitness because it has become increasingly difficult to sustain the effort; what I mean by this is that, rather than falling out of shape because I stopped working out, I had been feeling increasingly out of shape despite maintaining my fitness regimen, and had to severely dial it back as a result. More than you would expect someone in their 30s to need.

My posture has declined as well. I find myself consciously correcting it throughout the day, when it used to be a point of pride for me. I'll stoop, for lack of a better term, and I can feel the strain in my neck and back. This was never a problem before.

Balance has started to become an issue. I'll bump into things with my shoulder because I've lost balance slightly and deviated from a straight walking path. I shoulder checked an end cap display at the grocery store last night and almost knocked the shelf over; embarrassing for me, but my wife got a kick out of it, and it was admittedly funny in the way unexpected chaos can be.

And then there's the CCHS. I'll just stop breathing, even when I'm awake. I won't realize it's happened unless my wife alerts me to it or I notice the sleepiness that comes with hypercapnia. This happens many times per day; if I had to guess, I would say maybe a dozen, on average. It's particularly scary when it happens while I'm driving. This is something that's happened on and off for a few years now, but has seemingly snowballed in the past year and a half.

Outside of CCHS episodes, I experience excessive daytime sleepiness. Sometime around the early afternoon, I will find it nearly impossible to stay awake, even if I'm standing up. I've been using deep breathing and meditation to try and reset my system when it happens, which will stave it off for a while, but it creeps back within 15 minutes or so. This will go on for upwards of two hours, daily.

I can't have soup anymore. I have trouble keeping it from getting on my chin, and I can't swallow the broth. Not that the texture is bad or anything, but that I physically cannot swallow a lukewarm or hot liquid. My throat simply will not do it unless I focus intensely on doing so, and often it just ends in me almost choking. So I just avoid soup, hot coffee, and tea, now. 

I have started having hallucinations, starting about 6 months ago. They started as audio hallucinations, things like hearing a familiar but unplaceable song playing faintly below the ambient din - I have often been convinced there was music playing or people talking, when it was literally just the sound of the fan in the corner. More recently, maybe over the past month, I have started having visual hallucinations out of the corner of my eyes; I'll think someone is standing there, or is walking by, or that an animal is approaching me. There have been times where I have been alone and been startled to the point I yelled, and nothing was there.

My thought patterns have become much less organized, as you can probably tell by how these symptoms are laid out. I've started having difficulty following (or even remembering) directions. I take a long time to respond in conversations. I lose my train of thought. I struggle to find words. Strangely, my ability to communicate in written language has suffered much less than my verbal communication. My wife has mentioned that I seem much more nonverbal now than she's ever seen.

I have also started having these feelings in the center of my head, like an emptiness. It's like my brain is a bowl or a hollow ball. I don't know how to describe it other than just that I get these physical feelings that there's just empty space in the center of my brain. It's not some weird conflation with being spacey or absent minded; it is an actual, physical feeling. That's the best way I can describe it, sorry.

I started my journey to ADHD diagnosis last June. I had thought maybe I was experiencing burnout, but after so many years of such broad symptoms and the odd feeling they had to be connected somehow, I started doing the ol' Google research and realized I had a lot of overlap with adult ADHD. My brother has been diagnosed for 20 years now, so it made sense that it could be related. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist for evaluation and a couple months later we tried starting me on atomoxetine. 

It worked well. My mood seemed to regulate and, as we titrated me upwards in dosage, executive function seemed to start moving again. We got to 60mg and the sexual side effects were a chronic issue, so we reduced and added bupropion to try and compensate. I've been on this combination for about 6 months and while it worked great at first, I'm feeling the cognitive decline again.

I have not missed a dose. Both medications need consistent use to work at full strength and I'm well aware of that, so I have it cemented in my morning ritual. Still, I find myself forgetting things more often, having more issues with executive function, and this week I actually missed my appointment with my psychiatrist for the first time ever - despite reminders on my laptop and phone.

When I first described my cognitive symptoms to my psychiatrist, at the beginning of my ADHD evaluation, I half-jokingly said it felt like early onset dementia. But with the addition of autonomic dysregulation characterized as CCHS, and the cognitive symptoms gradually overcoming medications that you're not supposed to build a tolerance to, now I actually have to wonder if it actually could be MCI. What are the odds that I have ADHD *and* adult onset CCHS, vs the probability of MCI, right?

Please tell me it's all just unrelated stuff and I'm being paranoid. Or that I should get this all checked out. I can't make myself decide what the next move is.

One last thing: I mentioned being in the military. I was a medic for 11 years, 4 active and 7 reserves, but no combat deployments and no history of TBI. ",1,1728820396.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I have had some very funny experiences with my old clubs, though. Shafts snapping. My driver head came off last week. I've had 8 of the 11 clubs regripped. They're a right hodgepodge, but I love them. 

Whilst shopping for a new driver (replacing for the one whose head flung off), I was encouraged by the staff at my Pro shop to go for the same Wilson manufacture. I though this was quite dumb — as I'm only buying a driver I feel good with. Then at work, my golf-mad boss said the same thing whilst giving me tips on what to buy. ""Go search for your current brand first"" etc.

So naturally, I went with a TaylorMade just to continue with this jank club collection I have going on. 

But I just wondered if this is a ""thing"" in golf. You know how different sports have their different cultures (road cycling & coffee culture; rock climbing & talking about rock climbing etc...). And if indeed it is a thing, what other bits of unwritten golf etiquette do I need to fill myself in on before walking into my local course again next week?

1g2nsud,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1g2nsud/held_hostage_vs_hospitality/,Held hostage Vs Hospitality ,"Haven't been on Reddit for a long while but came back on as had a nightmare last night that brought back a lot of memories and a whole area of Narcissistic abuse that I haven't seen much posted about...
It is the whole idea of staying over at someone's house, the idea of someone else's 'hospitality'.
The way I see it, hospitality should be a nice thing and a way to give to another person but I have had so many bad experiences at staying at other people's houses (triggering a lot from my narcissistic upbringing) that these days...well honestly I would rather stay in a hotel or a rental than stay under someone else's roof and I think that is a very sad affair.

I dont want to give an amateur diagnosis of Narcissism to a lot of people I have stayed with but there does seem to be some inherited traits of toxicity in people that are probably from their parents. I have just come to the conclusion that sadly most people really don't know how to do hospitality. 
As a disclaimer, I acknowledge that this goes both ways. There is such a thing as being a bad guest or an ungrateful guest. Let's though (for the sake of argument) assume the guest in all these situations was acting like a fairly decent and normal guest with a regular level of manners and gratitude and expectation..

Narcissists and toxic people in general can create a 'hostage' environment where you feel trapped under their roof and though you may expect some basic level of hospitality, seeing as they did invite you to stay (NB. All examples given are concerning an invited/ expected guest, not an uninvited/unexpected guest or one who 'overstayed their welcome/ entitled guest) instead they seem to be expert at depriving a person of the very basics of survival. So this is a hostage situation rather than a hospitality one. 

1) Food and drink

Everyone knows that food and drink are the basics for human survival. When someone invites you to stay for the day and then overnight, there is a certain level of expectation that at some point there will be food and drink as even the host has to feed themselves.

I have stayed (and my boyfriend has too) with people and hours and hours have slipped by and they haven't offered anything to eat or drink (not even a glass of water). The usual meal times have come and gone and you are wondering if you are going to ever eat at all and it feels like a form of slow torture. It shouldn't have to get to the point that the guest asks for a glass of water but sadly I have been there.
My boyfriend stayed with a friend and when I called him, it was 11pm and they still hadn't eaten (all day) and he was wandering the streets (on the pretence of an evening stroll) looking for takeaway places and shops still open so he could eat.

There are other aspects of this. You may be offered food but the food is inedible/unsafe. I was once given raw chicken to eat (that had blood in it) and was told I was a 'picky eater' and neurotic for not eating something that would probably have put me in hospital.

There is also underfeeding and overfacing. You will be starving but then only offered a piece of toast or some biscuits. The opposite extreme is to be given a mountain of food and you are expected to eat it all. 
I have also had plates of food whipped away from me whilst I was still eating and the kitchen and table was being cleaned around me to make me feel unwelcome.

There have also been times where hosts will say 'help yourself' but there is nothing there to eat. I have even been told to rummage through their cupboards and faced with unlabelled tupperware boxes with different coloured liquids in them.

Suffice to say in a lot of situations I have either gone to bed hungry or nipped out to get some food elsewhere.

Obviously a lot of people have issues when it comes to food but they don't recognise themselves as being strange and disordered about food, they see this as normal behaviour but maybe not...

The 'maybe not' is the room for doubt, that they actually know how to host properly but they are actually choosing not to.
The most glaring example is what I would call 'feast or famine'.
This is when a host accommodates you very well when you first arrive that you are bowled over. They are very attentive and generous. Good food served at a normal time and nothing is too much for them. In these situations you are very moved about how gracious they are and generous and you feel treated like a king/queen! It feels like being spoiled and you feel a little embarrassed at the effort put in just for you! 
You go to sleep though feeling as though you are having the best time ever and you feel special and that they must really care for you! Then comes the morning ....

The atmosphere has changed overnight and your host seems like a completely different person as the one the previous night. They are cold and dismissive and they make you feel as though you need to leave their house in the next 5 mins.
It's early morning and they don't even offer you toast or tea or coffee before you leave. They don't show any concern about how you will travel back to your own place and they don't even say 'goodbye'. I have left such places crying and thinking ""what did I do wrong? How did I upset them?""

I once described this scenario to a therapist as the day the fair/circus ends. The big plug is pulled out and all the music, lights and fanfare has been extinguished in seconds. Then you are left with the cold, dark night..alone!

2) Sleep

This is always (in my experience) about sleep deprivation. It is either about being kept awake too long talking (and you can't keep your eyes open) or woken at a much too early rising time (or a combination of the two).
I once stayed at a cottage and the room we were sleeping in was the room where all the talking was! It was getting on for 3am and I almost collapsed in a faint on the sofa as I was that tired. Again it felt like slow torture.

EXTRA TRIGGER WARNING (SA) (to skip this, continue after end of warning) ⚠️ 

In three situations where I have slept over at someone's house (the opposite sex), there seems to have been an unwritten rule that payment for staying at their house was sex.

One of these situations bordered on a rape scenario but thankfully it didn't happen.
Another scenario I was staying with a male university friend and didn't have anywhere to live.
When I refused his demand for sex, he threw me out at night in the rain with nowhere to go.

END OF TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ 

I have come to the conclusion after nearly 50 years of being someone's guest that most people do not know how to host and be hospitable.
If they DO know then you are expected to pay some hidden cost later on.
I know that a lot of these issues (a lot) are probably because a lot of people do not actually know how to do self care and so obviously don't know how to do 'other care'. They don't realise this but they want to show people they can have guests stay over but are not ready for that yet.

The difference of course are the ones who know how to treat people reasonably but they just choose not to and are intermittent with their treatment.
There are also those who are downright abusive.

As a disclaimer.. I am not perfect and certainly not a perfect host. I wouldn't however offer hospitality if I had no intention of following through. Whenever I have offered hospitality I have tried my best to be kind and attentive and gracious and most importantly, I have 'catered' to my guest. What that means is that I have served my guest and catered to them while they have stayed with me and asked them if they wanted something. Obviously as long as I had the means to provide, I did.

The way I see it though, if hotels did any of the above things listed, they would get bad ratings and close down. 
I would've thought commonplace hospitality would be better than a hotel in that it is more genuine and personal and comes from a loving place rather than being a buying of goods and services.
I would rather have someone's basic kindness than a 5 star deluxe hotel. Its not what you have (financially or materially) it is the welcome you give people.
Simple food and lodgings served with warm kindness is better than feasts served by a cold unpredictable host.

TLDR
I guess I just wanted to get that off my chest that staying with other people has been such a uniformly bad and even traumatic experience for me that I would rather stay in a hotel where I know it won't be weird in anyway. 
Some people seem to make guests feel more like a hostage in a prison than a welcomed guest given their hospitality.",1,1728819827.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1g2nrtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/prayers/comments/1g2nrtj/the_best_plans/,The Best Plans,"Jeremiah 29:11 is a popular verse that’s often slapped onto journals, etched into coffee mugs, and printed on t-shirts.

“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”
‭‭Jeremiah‬ ‭29:11‬ ‭NIV‬‬

And God does have a plan for you.
God does want to bless you.
God does want to give you hope and a future. 

But—we should also pay attention to the original context …

In this case, God was speaking through the prophet Jeremiah to the people of Judah—people who’d recently been exiled to Babylon for 70 years. 

The Jewish people were banished to a foreign land because of their insatiable appetite for sin. In fact, for 23 years Jeremiah had been warning them to stop rebelling against God or prepare to face the consequences.

God is patient, but He is also just. In the preceding chapters, God made a case against His beloved people:

They’d exploited foreigners, orphans, and widows. They’d denied the rights of the poor. They’d refused to stand up for truth or obey God’s instructions. They’d murdered the innocent and committed adultery. They’d rejoiced in doing evil and their lives were ruled by greed. They’d even built pagan shrines, sacrificing their sons and daughters in the fires. It was a dark time. And yet, somehow, God’s mercy always extends to the darkest places on earth.

That’s why, just a few verses later, God said they could seek Him and find Him, and He’d bring them back from captivity (Jeremiah‬ ‭29:13‬-14).

That’s why he encouraged them—while in exile—to build houses, plant gardens, get married, have children, and work for the peace and prosperity of their temporary home (Jeremiah 29:5-7).

He wanted them to know: He hadn’t forgotten them. He still wanted good for them. He still had plans to restore them.

God is serious about sin, but He’s just as passionate about redemption.

Though Jeremiah 29:11 was meant for a specific people at a specific time, God’s heart for the restoration of broken people is generationally timeless. 

Even when we feel stuck in the process, God still has a plan. 
We can put our trust in the God whose goal is always redemption.",1,1728819714.0,prayers,0,1.0,False

1g2noav,https://i.redd.it/16duza8hfiud1.jpeg,What elements of my logo can be animated? ,"Logo on the Move: What Can You Animate?

1. ""Let’s Get this Logo Party Started""
Okay, folks, let’s talk logos. We’re all familiar with them—those little symbols that sit on everything from websites to coffee cups, staring at us like, “Yeah, I’m cool, but I could be cooler.” And guess what? They can be cooler! That’s right—your logo doesn’t have to sit there like a bump on a digital log. You can animate it. But what parts, you ask? Hold on to your seats because this is where things get fun.

2. ""The Swoosh, Spin, and Wiggle Show""
First up—your logo’s shape. Got a swoosh? Spin it. Got a triangle? Make it flip. Got a banana (hey, I don’t judge)? Watch it peel! The shape of your logo is the star of the show. You don’t just want it to sit there like a lazy cat—make it move like it’s had three espressos! Spin, expand, or fold—let your shape do the talking, or in this case, the wiggling.

3. ""Color Pop: The Flashier, The Better""
Now let’s talk about color. You thought your logo’s colors were cool before? Wait until they start glowing, shifting, and blending! Imagine a smooth gradient wash across your logo, or maybe a neon flicker that says, ""Yeah, I’m alive, and I’ve got style!"" Color animation is like your logo putting on its fanciest suit and hitting the dance floor.

4. ""Text That Doesn't Just Sit There""
We’ve all seen text in logos, right? But what if I told you that text could do things? Yeah, like bounce, stretch, or even dissolve into a million pieces (not to get too dramatic, but it’s possible!). Whether your brand name slides into place or each letter does a little happy dance, your text is way more than just something to read—it’s something to watch.

5. ""Icons That Say, 'Look at Me!'""
Got an icon in your logo? Time to bring it to life. Picture a lightning bolt sparking, a globe spinning, or a flame flickering. Icons were made to move! Even if it’s something as simple as a leaf gently swaying in the breeze, your icon animation can add a whole new layer of personality to your brand. It’s like turning a 2D picture into a mini-movie!

6. ""The Element of Surprise""
Let’s not forget the most crucial part—surprise. Your logo animation can (and should) have an element that makes people go, “Whoa, didn’t see that coming!” Whether it’s a subtle shift or an explosion of movement, the goal is to keep your audience guessing, entertained, and, most importantly, hooked. Your animated logo should leave them wanting more. Think of it as the grand finale to a magic trick—except instead of a rabbit out of a hat, it’s your logo doing the cha-cha.

7. ""Conclusion: Your Logo, Now in HD""
So, what elements of your logo can you animate? Pretty much all of them! The shape, the colors, the text, the icons—if it’s part of your logo, it’s game for animation. The only limit?

I sleep only a few hours, usually between 5 to 6 hours, and when I wake up, I feel tired, which negatively impacts my energy levels at work. Even if I manage to sleep for 7 hours, I often wake up multiple times, sometimes up to 6 times.

I have tried many solutions, including cutting out coffee for a while, but to no avail. I searched on YouTube and found some people talking about certain supplements, which I purchased, but they did not work either. In 2020, I heard about a sleep clinic and decided to go there. They told me I needed to spend the night for a sleep study. I spent the night connected to many wires, and they instructed me to sleep with just one pillow for more accurate testing.

After two hours, I woke up unable to breathe. They placed a breathing device on me, and I fell asleep again. When I woke up, I was surprised to find that I had slept for 6 continuous hours, which hadn’t happened in years. I felt like I had found the solution and that my problem was resolved. The doctor informed me that I needed to buy a CPAP machine.

I contacted the insurance company, which initially refused but later accepted, allowing me to purchase the device that cost about $1500, with a significant portion covered by the insurance.

After buying the machine, I took a 3-day leave from work, thinking that this time would be dedicated to sleeping since I needed to compensate for years of lost sleep. However, on the first day, I was shocked to face the same old problem. I tried again the next day, but unfortunately, the result was the same. I called the doctor, who said I needed time to get used to the mask and the machine.

After a month of use, I still hadn’t noticed any improvement. The doctor adjusted the air flow settings, suggesting it might help, but unfortunately, I didn’t see any difference. A year later, I returned to the clinic, and they changed the machine, but the situation remained the same. I thought it might be the type of mask, so I bought a new one, but to no avail. In the end, I stopped using the device and decided to live with the problem.

During this period, my British friend reached out to me, saying he was experiencing the same issue. He visited a doctor and bought a device that he claimed worked for him. He lent me his machine to try, but unfortunately, it didn’t benefit me either. I was puzzled as to why I benefited in the hospital but not at home. I even began to suspect that the hospital might have used a sedative to help me sleep, convincing me that the device was the reason for my improved sleep, so I would buy it from them.

Throughout this time, I continued searching for solutions. I purchased products like nasal strips and mouth-closure strips to help me breathe through my nose while sleeping, and I even bought blue light-blocking glasses, but they were of no benefit. I spoke with a therapist, thinking she might assist me in dealing with stress, and she provided me with exercises like breathing before bed and focusing on positive thoughts, which helped slightly but soon wore off.

I also received advice about keeping a journal before sleep, but its effect was minimal and faded over time. I have spent over $2000 on vitamins, supplements, devices, and therapy, all without success.

Is there anyone who has a solution or a similar experience to share? I would appreciate any advice, as I am suffering without solutions.",2,1728818604.0,sleep,2,1.0,False

I have quite a few years of experience in the hospitality industry: working in the kitchens, as a barista, bartender etc.

Slightly over a month ago the coffee shop I worked at unfortunately closed down forever and the boss let us know about it a 1.5 weeks before it did...

Fast forward to now and I have sent what feels like over a 100 CVs. 
I've had a couple of interviews, but every single damn interview goes more or less like this:
""You seem like a great fit and we'll definitely get back to you tomorrow to put you on your first shift""; 

They pretty much NEVER do! I was starting to think whether it's me and I say something wrong, but it's not the case. I just state that yes theprevious workplace was very busy (coffee shop that closed down which I mentioned was in an extremely busy location) so I work very well under pressure and during very busy periods etc.

I literally say nothing that would prevent from getting a job.

I've had an interview on Friday as I left my CV in a restaurant on Thursday and was called the next day slightly past 1pm to come for an interview at 4pm.

I came in, the interview went great, the manager lady told me that they really need someone ASAP, that my previous experience looks very good, that it's a huge bonus that live so close to the restaurant etc.
She then proceeds to tell me that she will contact me via an email or call the next day to schedule the first shift.

I wait for a whole Saturday like an idiot for them to get back to me, but nobody did. 
I called them this morning after they opened (Sunday) and I was told that the manager is on holidays all of a sudden and that she will be back on Monday or Tuesday maybe.
I mean seriously?!

I have wasted my time on interviews just like this one multiple times in the past month.
I'm literally at my wits end right now. I really, really need to get a job ASAP, but the recruiters simply waste mine and their time constantly!

What drives me insane though is why the heck do they tell me that everything went great during the interview, that they need someone to fill in the position ASAP and I seem like a great fit, just for me to then wait like and idiot for a call or an email that never comes?

I lost over 3KG over the past month because I cannot think about anything else other than getting a job which seems impossible due to the recruiters constantly lying.

Is it really that hard to find a job now :/?",3,1728818338.0,UKJobs,4,0.8,False

Great home, great kids, very loving and happy relationship.  We are talking American dream kind of relationship, love and family.  It was that way for years.  We were the couple and parents that made everyone jealous.  We were involved in school for the kids, coached sports, PTA president, helped the community, organized events the whole nine yards.

I had a great job but I worked too much because I loved it.  Plus it provided an amazing quality of life for my family.  The Saturday of my ex wife’s 30th birthday I got called to work.  I happily got packed up (her up and making me coffee and spending a little time together as we did every morning) and headed to work.  It was only a few hours just to help knock something out and I’d be home by noon for her birthday.

I got to work, got in my big rig, left my terminal and was on my way.  What happened next changed mine and my families life forever.

I pulled up to an intersection saw a tractor trailer turning into the road I was coming off of and didn’t see anything coming.  I got 3 feet into the intersection when a car that was speeding 30+ over the speed limit hit me.  I never even saw them.  I thought the truck engine blew….It was a young mother and her teenage daughter.  They did not make it.  I tried to save the girl and had her head in my hands.  It was terrible in the worst ways and messed me up so bad that parts of me just shut down.  I had severe injuries and was rushed to a local ER and had a few out patient procedures done then was sent home.

I shut down emotionally.  Just absolutely dead inside.  My wife was scared, didn’t know what to do and over time grew lonely.  I was just broken and dead inside.  She had found people that she thought were her friends but just wanted to use her.  Really hurt her and since I was of zero assistance we grew apart due to my mental state.

Finally I said hell with it and filed for divorce.  Took a couple years.  We stayed under the same roof as the kids were little then the PTSD got bad enough that I didn’t want to be around anymore.  Once my daughter hit the same age as the girl who passed away in the accident I couldn’t stay around them anymore.  It was a constant reminder and I couldn’t stand the thought of that happening to them.

We separated in 2017 and finally divorced during Covid.  I finally couldn’t take anymore and reached out for mental health.  (Something I should have done years before.)  I got better but never figured my ex and I would work so I moved on.  Had a couple relationships that were just awful and she never hit it off either because people suck.  Mind you we still parented really well together and always got along.  When major life events happened we were always there and would do anything for one another.

After all the damage and trauma that was caused, which we both blame ourselves for and apologize to each other for often, I realized she is still the person I love and want to be with.  She is scared to death that she will lose me if we do rekindle something and I don’t want to ever hurt her again.  We get along amazing, parent insanely well, have a great physical relationship, are alway there for each other but we are both scared that if we fully commit like we once did that we will end up losing each other again.

Personally she is the person I want to grow old with.  Our kids are nearly grown and it’s been years since the accident.  Should we try this again?  ",2,1728817988.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

I asked why and he said that he was a former barista and that because the ground beans were going to sit there for awhile, he wanted them ground finer so that they'd still cause a bloom and extract properly. 

I just did what he asked, and it does obviously make sense that older beans be ground finer, but if you are pre-grinding the whole bag, what difference does it really make? You're still rapidly losing flavor by the hour after coffee is ground let alone days or weeks. Why even bother buying $20+ beans?

","Have you been struggling to shed those extra pounds, and a supplement called **Liv Pure** has caught your eye?

In this review, we'll take an in-depth look at Liv Pure, a weight loss supplement that has been creating quite a buzz lately.

# [✅Visit Official Website Get VIP Discount!](https://shorturl.at/48iLT)

Liv Pure claims to be a ""Liver Purification Complex,"" which is a fancy way of saying it will help clean your liver and boost your metabolism, making it easier for you to lose weight.

But does it really live up to the hype? Let's find out!

# What is Liv Pure, and What Does it Claim to Do?

Liv Pure is a dietary supplement that comes in capsule form. According to its website, it is a weight loss aid that uses two special blends of ingredients to achieve its effects.

The first blend, called the ""Liver Fat-Burning Complex,"" contains ingredients like green coffee bean extract and green tea extract, which are supposed to help your body burn off excess fat.

The second blend, the ""Liver Purification Complex,"" includes things like milk thistle seed extract and berberine, which are meant to detoxify your liver and improve its function.

Together, these two blends are said to boost your metabolism and make it easier for your body to get rid of unwanted fat. In other words, Liv Pure claims to be a natural and effective way to support your weight loss journey.

# 😊 What I Like About Liv Pure

Now, before I get into the things I don't like about Liv Pure (and there are a few), let's talk about the positives.

* **Scientific Backing for Ingredients** - First of all, I want to give credit where credit is due: the ingredients in Liv Pure do have some scientific backing. For example, there is research suggesting that green tea extract can boost metabolism and aid weight loss, especially when combined with exercise. Similarly, milk thistle, one of the key ingredients in the Liver Purification Complex, has been studied for its potential liver-protecting and anti-inflammatory effects, which could indirectly support weight loss.
* **Money-Back Guarantee -** Another thing I like about Liv Pure is that they offer a 60-day money-back guarantee. This shows that the company has some confidence in its product, and it gives customers a risk-free opportunity to try the supplement. If you're not happy with the results, you can always get your money back, which is definitely a plus.

# 😔What I Don't Like About Liv Pure

Unfortunately, there are several concerns I have about Liv Pure that make me hesitant to recommend it.

**Proprietary Blends and Lack of Transparency**

One of the biggest issues is the use of proprietary blends. In the supplement world, a proprietary blend means that the company doesn't have to disclose the exact amount of each ingredient in the blend.

In Liv Pure's case, this means we don't know how much of each ingredient, like green tea extract or milk thistle, is actually in each capsule.

# [✅Visit Official Website Get VIP Discount!](https://shorturl.at/48iLT)

This lack of transparency is a red flag because it makes it impossible to know if the product contains enough of each ingredient to be effective.

For all we know, there could be minimal amounts of the beneficial ingredients, with the rest of the capsule being filled with cheaper substances (also known as fillers).

**Fake Founders and Untrustworthy Marketing**

Another major concern is the fact that the supposed founders of Liv Pure, Dr. Nicholas Andino and Dan Saunders, don't seem to be real people.

I tried searching for them online, and no reliable information came up. This is a significant trust issue and makes me question the legitimacy of the entire product.

Additionally, the company behind Liv Pure seems nonexistent, and I couldn't find any information about their offices or contact details.

This lack of transparency is concerning and makes it difficult to hold them accountable for their product.

**Fake and Misleading Reviews**

When I looked for reviews of Liv Pure online, I found mostly fake or misleading ones. On sites like YouTube and Facebook, there are many positive reviews, but they seem insincere and may even be paid promotions.

On the other hand, trustworthy sites like Consumer Reports and Trustpilot had little to no reviews, and the few that were there were negative.

# [✅Visit Official Website Get VIP Discount!](https://shorturl.at/48iLT)

**Lack of Standardization and Third-Party Testing**

Liv Pure also falls short when it comes to **standardization** and **third-party testing**.

Standardization ensures that each batch of the supplement contains consistent levels of active compounds, which is important for safety and effectiveness. However, Liv Pure does not seem to use standardized extracts for its herbal ingredients.

Additionally, they do not provide certificates from third-party laboratories confirming that the product contains what it says on the label and that it is free from contaminants. This lack of transparency and quality control is concerning.

# Conclusion

While Liv Pure does contain ingredients with scientific backing for weight loss and liver health, there are simply **too many red flags for me to recommend it.**

The use of proprietary blends, the untrustworthy marketing tactics, the fake founders, and the lack of transparency about the company and product quality all raise serious concerns.

While the 60-day money-back guarantee might make it tempting to give Liv Pure a try, I believe there are better weight loss supplements on the market that are more transparent, trustworthy, and likely to be effective.

","Have you been struggling to shed those extra pounds, and a supplement called **Liv Pure** has caught your eye?

In this review, we'll take an in-depth look at Liv Pure, a weight loss supplement that has been creating quite a buzz lately.

# [✅Visit Official Website Get VIP Discount!](https://shorturl.at/48iLT)

Liv Pure claims to be a ""Liver Purification Complex,"" which is a fancy way of saying it will help clean your liver and boost your metabolism, making it easier for you to lose weight.

But does it really live up to the hype? Let's find out!

# What is Liv Pure, and What Does it Claim to Do?

Liv Pure is a dietary supplement that comes in capsule form. According to its website, it is a weight loss aid that uses two special blends of ingredients to achieve its effects.

The first blend, called the ""Liver Fat-Burning Complex,"" contains ingredients like green coffee bean extract and green tea extract, which are supposed to help your body burn off excess fat.

The second blend, the ""Liver Purification Complex,"" includes things like milk thistle seed extract and berberine, which are meant to detoxify your liver and improve its function.

Together, these two blends are said to boost your metabolism and make it easier for your body to get rid of unwanted fat. In other words, Liv Pure claims to be a natural and effective way to support your weight loss journey.

# 😊 What I Like About Liv Pure

Now, before I get into the things I don't like about Liv Pure (and there are a few), let's talk about the positives.

* **Scientific Backing for Ingredients** - First of all, I want to give credit where credit is due: the ingredients in Liv Pure do have some scientific backing. For example, there is research suggesting that green tea extract can boost metabolism and aid weight loss, especially when combined with exercise. Similarly, milk thistle, one of the key ingredients in the Liver Purification Complex, has been studied for its potential liver-protecting and anti-inflammatory effects, which could indirectly support weight loss.
* **Money-Back Guarantee -** Another thing I like about Liv Pure is that they offer a 60-day money-back guarantee. This shows that the company has some confidence in its product, and it gives customers a risk-free opportunity to try the supplement. If you're not happy with the results, you can always get your money back, which is definitely a plus.

# 😔What I Don't Like About Liv Pure

Unfortunately, there are several concerns I have about Liv Pure that make me hesitant to recommend it.

**Proprietary Blends and Lack of Transparency**

One of the biggest issues is the use of proprietary blends. In the supplement world, a proprietary blend means that the company doesn't have to disclose the exact amount of each ingredient in the blend.

In Liv Pure's case, this means we don't know how much of each ingredient, like green tea extract or milk thistle, is actually in each capsule.

# [✅Visit Official Website Get VIP Discount!](https://shorturl.at/48iLT)

This lack of transparency is a red flag because it makes it impossible to know if the product contains enough of each ingredient to be effective.

For all we know, there could be minimal amounts of the beneficial ingredients, with the rest of the capsule being filled with cheaper substances (also known as fillers).

**Fake Founders and Untrustworthy Marketing**

Another major concern is the fact that the supposed founders of Liv Pure, Dr. Nicholas Andino and Dan Saunders, don't seem to be real people.

I tried searching for them online, and no reliable information came up. This is a significant trust issue and makes me question the legitimacy of the entire product.

Additionally, the company behind Liv Pure seems nonexistent, and I couldn't find any information about their offices or contact details.

This lack of transparency is concerning and makes it difficult to hold them accountable for their product.

**Fake and Misleading Reviews**

When I looked for reviews of Liv Pure online, I found mostly fake or misleading ones. On sites like YouTube and Facebook, there are many positive reviews, but they seem insincere and may even be paid promotions.

On the other hand, trustworthy sites like Consumer Reports and Trustpilot had little to no reviews, and the few that were there were negative.

# [✅Visit Official Website Get VIP Discount!](https://shorturl.at/48iLT)

**Lack of Standardization and Third-Party Testing**

Liv Pure also falls short when it comes to **standardization** and **third-party testing**.

Standardization ensures that each batch of the supplement contains consistent levels of active compounds, which is important for safety and effectiveness. However, Liv Pure does not seem to use standardized extracts for its herbal ingredients.

Additionally, they do not provide certificates from third-party laboratories confirming that the product contains what it says on the label and that it is free from contaminants. This lack of transparency and quality control is concerning.

# Conclusion

While Liv Pure does contain ingredients with scientific backing for weight loss and liver health, there are simply **too many red flags for me to recommend it.**

The use of proprietary blends, the untrustworthy marketing tactics, the fake founders, and the lack of transparency about the company and product quality all raise serious concerns.

While the 60-day money-back guarantee might make it tempting to give Liv Pure a try, I believe there are better weight loss supplements on the market that are more transparent, trustworthy, and likely to be effective.

**Lack of Standardization and Third-Party Testing**

Liv Pure also falls short when it comes to **standardization** and **third-party testing**.

Standardization ensures that each batch of the supplement contains consistent levels of active compounds, which is important for safety and effectiveness. However, Liv Pure does not seem to use standardized extracts for its herbal ingredients.

Additionally, they do not provide certificates from third-party laboratories confirming that the product contains what it says on the label and that it is free from contaminants. This lack of transparency and quality control is concerning.

# Conclusion

While Liv Pure does contain ingredients with scientific backing for weight loss and liver health, there are simply **too many red flags for me to recommend it.**

The use of proprietary blends, the untrustworthy marketing tactics, the fake founders, and the lack of transparency about the company and product quality all raise serious concerns.

While the 60-day money-back guarantee might make it tempting to give Liv Pure a try, I believe there are better weight loss supplements on the market that are more transparent, trustworthy, and likely to be effective.

","Have you been struggling to shed those extra pounds, and a supplement called **Liv Pure** has caught your eye?

In this review, we'll take an in-depth look at Liv Pure, a weight loss supplement that has been creating quite a buzz lately.

# [✅Visit Official Website Get VIP Discount!](https://shorturl.at/48iLT)

Liv Pure claims to be a ""Liver Purification Complex,"" which is a fancy way of saying it will help clean your liver and boost your metabolism, making it easier for you to lose weight.

But does it really live up to the hype? Let's find out!

# What is Liv Pure, and What Does it Claim to Do?

Liv Pure is a dietary supplement that comes in capsule form. According to its website, it is a weight loss aid that uses two special blends of ingredients to achieve its effects.

The first blend, called the ""Liver Fat-Burning Complex,"" contains ingredients like green coffee bean extract and green tea extract, which are supposed to help your body burn off excess fat.

The second blend, the ""Liver Purification Complex,"" includes things like milk thistle seed extract and berberine, which are meant to detoxify your liver and improve its function.

Together, these two blends are said to boost your metabolism and make it easier for your body to get rid of unwanted fat. In other words, Liv Pure claims to be a natural and effective way to support your weight loss journey.

# 😊 What I Like About Liv Pure

Now, before I get into the things I don't like about Liv Pure (and there are a few), let's talk about the positives.

* **Scientific Backing for Ingredients** - First of all, I want to give credit where credit is due: the ingredients in Liv Pure do have some scientific backing. For example, there is research suggesting that green tea extract can boost metabolism and aid weight loss, especially when combined with exercise. Similarly, milk thistle, one of the key ingredients in the Liver Purification Complex, has been studied for its potential liver-protecting and anti-inflammatory effects, which could indirectly support weight loss.
* **Money-Back Guarantee -** Another thing I like about Liv Pure is that they offer a 60-day money-back guarantee. This shows that the company has some confidence in its product, and it gives customers a risk-free opportunity to try the supplement. If you're not happy with the results, you can always get your money back, which is definitely a plus.

# 😔What I Don't Like About Liv Pure

Unfortunately, there are several concerns I have about Liv Pure that make me hesitant to recommend it.

**Proprietary Blends and Lack of Transparency**

One of the biggest issues is the use of proprietary blends. In the supplement world, a proprietary blend means that the company doesn't have to disclose the exact amount of each ingredient in the blend.

In Liv Pure's case, this means we don't know how much of each ingredient, like green tea extract or milk thistle, is actually in each capsule.

# [✅Visit Official Website Get VIP Discount!](https://shorturl.at/48iLT)

This lack of transparency is a red flag because it makes it impossible to know if the product contains enough of each ingredient to be effective.

For all we know, there could be minimal amounts of the beneficial ingredients, with the rest of the capsule being filled with cheaper substances (also known as fillers).

**Fake Founders and Untrustworthy Marketing**

Another major concern is the fact that the supposed founders of Liv Pure, Dr. Nicholas Andino and Dan Saunders, don't seem to be real people.

I tried searching for them online, and no reliable information came up. This is a significant trust issue and makes me question the legitimacy of the entire product.

Additionally, the company behind Liv Pure seems nonexistent, and I couldn't find any information about their offices or contact details.

This lack of transparency is concerning and makes it difficult to hold them accountable for their product.

**Fake and Misleading Reviews**

When I looked for reviews of Liv Pure online, I found mostly fake or misleading ones. On sites like YouTube and Facebook, there are many positive reviews, but they seem insincere and may even be paid promotions.

Good Morning!  It's early this beautiful Sunday morning but the day is beginning!  Have I mentioned...I enjoy doing these first letters to you early because I know it's something LOVELY for you to wake up to?

What are you doing today?  I know you'll be going to church, but is there anything else going on today with you?  After writing you I'll be doing a Bible study round, and I DID start my other Bible study last night (read the first 10 Chapters of Matthew!).

I'm going to exercise too before heading out to breakfast at BJs.  Dunlap after that, and church, too!  Usually we grab a cup of coffee (or some such) inbetween the two.

As for the rest of today...both my studies, writing you through the day 🥰😍😘 music for us...I think a good, blessed, and nice day here.  That's all my half asleep self can think of currently anyway lol.

I wish you a blessed day, too, and one even more beautiful than you, yourself...if a day can be that beautiful 🌷🌹🥺 (a tall order you know!).

Please remember to get enough sleep, my 😇 

I'm so proud of you, always, and I miss you each and every second until we reunite, babe 💚💐💍😇😘💖

People think it’s cute that my name’s *Darling.* ﻿

It was supposed to be Darlene, but the way Mom said it sounded like Darling, and the hospital registrar printed it that way. So, Darling it was. Darling Carmen Thelma Marcos.

I lived with my family in San Judas, about an hour drive from San Julian. It was a small, middle-of-nowhere town in the California Valley. I had one older brother. His name was Junior. My parents were hardworking folks; Dad was a high school literature teacher and Mom ran a little general store. They raised me and Junior strict Catholic and taught us to be obedient. So, we asked no questions, and did what we were told.

We didn’t go out of town much, and whenever we did, we’d just visit some other small, middle-of-nowhere town near San Judas. Dad thought it was too dangerous to go to the bigger cities. Too many lunatics out in the world, he said.

Other than that, it was home, school, and church. With that kind of upbringing, you could say that I developed a weak spine. Weak and sheltered. San Judas was the only known world to me. I was a smidge envious of other kids whose families took them to places like Disneyland and Hollywood, even Las Vegas. I didn’t have friends. I was just a nobody to everyone. Nothing I did was ever enough for other kids to take an interest in me.

If I wanted a taste of excitement, I listened to Dad’s stories about aswangs. It was a thrill I looked forward to, every night before bedtime. Aswangs were creatures of the night that stole corpses. Not only that, but they fed on fetuses, and the sick and dying. He’d sworn he’d encountered one as a young boy in the Philippines. 

He had the habit of hiding under his Lola’s bed when he played hide-and-seek with his siblings. Then, one night, he found himself beside this red-eyed demon with a long snake-like tongue licking his Lola’s cold limp hand dangling off the bedside.   

Those stories stirred my imagination. I’d wake up in the middle of the night and see their shadows outside the bedroom. Just standing there, peering right in with their red eyes. I’d be covered in sweat, with my bed sheet soaked in ruin. I was that scared. I was young then, perhaps 10 years old at the time.

Oh, Junior got a kick out of it. He’d shut off the lights in the bedroom and hide behind the long curtains, or in the closet. Then he would wait for me to come in so he could jump out and scream. Mom would slap him upside on the head. She got him to stop, and she assured me that aswangs were just stories. But her words couldn’t soothe the bubbling fear in the pit of my stomach. And so, to ease my mind for a decent night’s sleep, Mom lined the bedroom windowsill with salt and cloves of garlic. These were natural protections against the aswang.

But still, I wanted more horror tales. There wasn’t a shortage of them in town, for sure. At my school, kids talked about a woman who lived in a decrepit house next to the local pet cemetery. They said she was a witch, or as Dad would say, an aswang—the aswang of San Judas.

Rumor had it that during the day she’d take on human form, in order to blend in with the townsfolk. No matter how human she tried to make herself look, they said you could still spot her in a crowd. But San Judas had a bunch of strange-looking folks. It wasn’t easy to pinpoint who was the witch unless you came face-to-face with her. Because when you got up close, you could see your reflection, turned upside down, in her eyes. And when she smiled, you’d see rows of crooked, jagged teeth from the opening of her mouth down to the throat. That would be the last thing you saw before she devoured your head.

At night, she transformed into a winged, vampiric beast. People were quick to blame the aswang of San Judas for every misfortune. I remembered when the Aquino house across the street from ours went ablaze one night. They were a family with nine children. That night, Mr. and Mrs. Aquino and four of their children made it out of the fire, but five didn’t. Junior and I watched it all happen from the porch.

The smoke was so powerful. Singed our nose hairs right off! I can still smell it to this day. All night long I held my breath, listening to the screams.  We all thought they had burned alive in the house. I was always curious about these morbid things.

When they put out the fire, the firemen went in and searched for the five missing kids. I was certain they’d find human remains, but they found nothing. Not a single charred bone. The strangest thing was that they were never able to determine the origin of the fire. So, everybody pointed their fingers at the aswang. They said she started the fire with the intention of kidnapping the children. Why? Many thought that it was for a kind of ceremony of human sacrifice. I suspected that they were taken for dinner.

Dad thought different. ‘The fire happened because the Aquino kids misbehave all the time,’ he said, ‘and they don’t listen to their parents. That’s what happens when you don’t listen to your parents, and when you don’t go to church!’

I took his words to heart. For God said, *‘Honor your father and mother, and he who speaks ill of them will be put to death.’* So, that was what I did. I listened to my father’s instructions and didn’t forsake my mother’s teaching. But no matter how much I obeyed God and family; nothing could have saved me from the misfortune that changed my life. The day I lost my eyes.

Coffee spurts out from Cabrera’s mouth and stains his newly laundered white shirt. He coughs and gasps for air. He sets the mug down on the table and grabs a napkin to wipe his chin. In a momentary panic, he brushes his shirt, floundering in his attempts to scrub the coffee-droplets off his shirt.﻿

“Excuse me,” he blurts out the second that he catches his breath. “You lost your eyes?”

Darling nods. “That’s right; when I was about ten years old, I lost my eyes.”
Alvaro casts a doubtful look, raising a brow. “They look intact to me, Mrs. Ross.”

She folds her hands together and fixes a stern glance, and says, “Look, I don’t see how this is relevant to Mr. Jacobs’ death. So, if you please just tell us what information you have then we can move on.”

“Oh, it is relevant information, Detective. I need to tell you this part of the story.”

“Do you expect us to believe that a witch in San Judas is connected to Jacobs’ death?”

“Or an ass-wang,” adds Cabrera.

“Ah-swung,” Darling interrupts, correcting his pronunciation. “It’s aswang. When you open your mind, then your eyes will see the world beyond the world we know.”

Cabrera senses Alvaro’s incredulous glance. Her foot nudges his. She nods her head slightly towards the door. But he doesn’t want to go just yet. They’ve only started. He wants to delve deeper into this ‘world beyond.’ He looks at his subject with deepening curiosity, entranced by the possibility that something unusual – perhaps even supernatural - happened to Robert Jacobs and her ex-husbands.

Alvaro nudges his foot again. Stronger this time, with impatient eyes pressing him to end the interview immediately.

He looks down at his half-eaten cinnamon bun. But why leave? He hasn’t even finished.  It would be rude to just get up and leave it there, lonely, and uneaten on the plate. It was so thoughtful of her to make them.

We’re her guests, he tells himself. It’s only considerate to stay, hear her out, and finish the delicious bun. And, perchance, have another one.

Cabrera stares at the fork in his hand and admires how the sterling silver reflects the glistening sunlight as it pours through the window. It is almost a pity to see such beauty pass as he dips it into the bun for another bite.

Alvaro stomps on his foot, making his toes throb. He grunts and glares at his partner. She remains stoic with her hands folded on the table.

Cabrera gulps and clears his throat. “Tell us, Mrs. Ross, how did you lose your eyes?”

“Yes, tell us,” Alvaro says sardonically, rolling her eyes. “Our minds are ready to be open.”

Darling sips her tea, peering at them over the rim of her mug. Amusement twinkles in her brown eyes.

Here is the link: [https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/156456297218?\_skw=espresso+machine&epid=111053561&itmmeta=01JA2PTY3G7DNRYNKG6T3Q8VYS&hash=item246d85a302:g:H1MAAOSw-Q1nC4vr&itmprp=enc%3AAQAJAAAA0HoV3kP08IDx%2BKZ9MfhVJKlc%2Bodn%2FIQpnsZt1qyi866VWLb3vIqHEFpSKq5%2FBtSxXFABaTkin2XlE%2FfI%2F3d6lrPb31bpervgSZmZvZh7zZGVObnj%2Bkur8fKAfjx%2FTqiZMseC9Gb4qW%2FlaX3ObzB3qLjYOoF28KK1Cv1OvMEZdshxXY3dPK%2FCkdeV0go5sUQuJYWz%2BPeREX1tf0HnLGnIogdtPdAXf9XTQ1J227CwTvzj0cXezdrdS8wbkONpia%2BBIrD9NdwuSCtYREbWTz6UIXc%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR-jh69bQZA](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/156456297218?_skw=espresso+machine&epid=111053561&itmmeta=01JA2PTY3G7DNRYNKG6T3Q8VYS&hash=item246d85a302:g:H1MAAOSw-Q1nC4vr&itmprp=enc%3AAQAJAAAA0HoV3kP08IDx%2BKZ9MfhVJKlc%2Bodn%2FIQpnsZt1qyi866VWLb3vIqHEFpSKq5%2FBtSxXFABaTkin2XlE%2FfI%2F3d6lrPb31bpervgSZmZvZh7zZGVObnj%2Bkur8fKAfjx%2FTqiZMseC9Gb4qW%2FlaX3ObzB3qLjYOoF28KK1Cv1OvMEZdshxXY3dPK%2FCkdeV0go5sUQuJYWz%2BPeREX1tf0HnLGnIogdtPdAXf9XTQ1J227CwTvzj0cXezdrdS8wbkONpia%2BBIrD9NdwuSCtYREbWTz6UIXc%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR-jh69bQZA)

I’m kinda handy with tools but not super experienced when it comes to fixing espresso machines. Before I take the plunge, I wanted to ask if anyone here has experience repairing or troubleshooting machines like this. I’m no expert, but it looks like there’s some kind of blockage, though I’m not sure if it’s something that can be cleared with a basic descale or if there’s a bigger underlying issue. Is this a known problem and do you guys have ideas on how to solve it? 

Any advice or resources would be really appreciated! Thanks in advance! 🙏

1g2mvbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stalking/comments/1g2mvbs/im_being_stalked/,I’m being stalked ,"I got along with my stalker previously. I met him through a mutual friend. He lives around the corner from me and asked me to make him a coffee one time, so I did. After that he kept wanting to come in for coffee and asking for help with setting up his Bluetooth, tv, etc. I felt sorry for him because he is an alcoholic and says he has alcohol induced dementia. My ex and I looked after his dog when he was admitted to hospital overnight due to severe intoxication. 

After my ex and I broke up, he met with my ex to ask sexual, intimate questions about me. I told him I want nothing to do with him anymore as I consider that reprehensible and felt violated. I’ve learnt since then that others have had unsavoury experiences with him, that he’s a paedophile and a number of locals have protection orders against him. 

He’s shown up at my house about 8 times since then. One time I answered the door and he started to push his way in when I told him don’t come in. He doesn’t see anything wrong with this behaviour. I’ve told him he’s not welcome here. I’ve been very clear about that. Every time it’s a new BS excuse, eg. “I didn’t want or mean to, the dog led me to your door I couldn’t control him”, “I need to see your dog”, “I brought you flowers”, etc. I’ve told him sternly that he is stalking me. He gets nasty and gaslights, which is fine so long as he leaves me alone. The problem is he doesn’t leave me alone! The most recent time he showed up at my door was Thursday afternoon. 

My parents have advised not to go to the police because it’s too small of an issue to report and that if I ignore him he’ll go away. I feel like I’m doing something wrong because he won’t go away! I can confidently say that he sees absolutely nothing inappropriate about his behaviour. 

I called the police tonight as I crossed paths with him again today and he tried to engage with me (I ignored). They said from the incidents I’ve described they could potentially arrest him for stalking. Or I could get a protection order. Or I could just keep ignoring it like my parents recommend. 

Others who have been stalked - what would you suggest?

Ok, so my last update was when I was at hotel. During that night my wife's best friend called me and said she will be near her with kids. Me and her have great relationship and she is in my eyes by far her best friend. She called me in wednesday early in the morning that she is driving my kids for the school because my wife can't stop crying. I jumped in the car, picked my friend (witness) and we came to my house.

Honestly, I can say it was much easier than I expected to kick her out. Yeah, it wasn't the fastest process (2hrs) but at the end she left without police being involved. She cried, begged for forgivness, she will ""explain"" me everything, she screamed, begged again, didn't listen to her friend, my lawyer...I even told her if she doesn't leave I will call the police and do everything in my power to deport her. Again, she didn't want to leave. She just wanted to talk with me. Then I just said to myself that I will lie to her. I told her to leave if she loves me so I can have space and that I will call her today when I think a little bit about everything. I just wanted her to see out of my property. She left with some clothes shortly after. Since then she lives with her best friend.

During the day I did most of the things I needed. Changed the locks at the house and at the gates of the property. Cut her off from everything that is on my name and she uses. I hired the babysitter ""Melody"". In the monday I talked with my co-worker (female). She also has younger kids and she recommended me Melody. Melody doesn't work for her anymore because my co-worker's husband is now working from home so they don't need her anymore. Melody is really nice. She is also from Asia, speaks great english and local language, she drives, cooks, cleans, CV is good, no criminal record...so I agreed that she works for me. I also tested my kids and myself for STDs. My kids asked me after the school where is my wife. I told them we will be separated for now. They had some questions, I told them if they want to talk or see her just let me know. Both of my sons said it's okay and that was that. They met Melody and they look normal around her. My wife called me whole day and again sent so many messages.

Then in thursday I had another chaos with her. I drove my kids to the school and my daughter to the kindergarten. I came back at home. I was doing some things on the PC, Melody was doing chores and then I had a call from the school where both of my sons go. The principal called me and said my wife wanted to see my older son during the class and that security stopped her. She made the scene and said to her that she didn't see her kids for 2 days...again, I jumped immediately in the car. I needed at least 30 minutes to come there. During those 30 minutes the principal called me again and said she talked with my wife again and that she and psychologist in the school contacted child protective service(CPS) because apparently that's the law where we live (it's not!) do to that in these situations.

When I came in the school my wife again wanted me to talk to her. Begged, cried...same all, same all. All of that infront of people from the school. They explained to me that my wife told them she didn't see kids for 2 days and is scared. Then one woman arrived from the CPS. She started to attack me immediately how can I just steal kids from their mom. I was shocked. She was accusing me like I am some kind of drug dealer. To be honest, my wife did defend me in front of them. She said I didn't steal kids and I didn't forbid her anything, but she wanted to see them now because I kicked her out of the house. She ""just"" wants to come back in the house, will do anything  blah, blah, blah...when she said that, that woman from the CPS and the principal attacked me again. They even suggested my wife to call the police because they assumed I kicked her out without anything and that I was aggresive.

When I heard that I had enough. I called the lawyer immediately. He was busy but told me he will come and to not speak with them. I was waiting for him and didn't say a word. My wife explained everyone what happened in our lives. She was more or less honest and again she said she will do this and that, I need to forgive her, she loves me...blah, blah, blah... while she was saying that literally everyone gave her support. I was just speechless. Then when she tried to hug me or kiss, I pushed her away and this woman from the CPS said that I have clear signs of abuser. I was so close to say her a lot of things but again I didn't say anything. My wife told her that's not true and that I have never ever raised voice let alone hand on her and it's her fault but she loves me and can't live without me...

Before my lawyer came, another woman from CPS arrived and she was the same like the first one. I am the worst, I am horrible, my wife is sweet and innocent. Whatever. My lawyer came and he was furious on them. He showed all the details about me. About my wife. Mostly immigration details. He said she doesn't work, doesn't have a place to live, might be deported and is mentally unstable and is not the right person to be around my kids. He told them about some articles in the law that they can't do this and that this is against the law. While he was speaking my wife realized he is my divorce lawyer and started to attack him how he can be so cruel and without heart....the principal told her and me to leave the office while they are talking inside. We were in the hallway, again she cries, tries to talk with me. I was just looking at the security guy who was 100% laughing inside himself with what kind of lunatic I need to deal with.

The principal left the office and went to bring my kids. My older son asked me what is going on, I just told him to answer what they ask him and that's it. After maybe 3 minutes, the principal called us to come in the office. That first cow from the CPS said the kids said everything and that they have the most important details. I asked them what details and she said both of my sons said they want to stay with me and that they enjoy with me. They repeated the same in front of me and wife. My wife for 100th time started to cry again, my older son even moved a little bit so she can't hug him. They left after that. These women from CPS said me and my wife need to make a deal for the kids. I said we will after I solve everything what I need. And then she gave me a paper and told me to sign. It was in the local language so I needed a little bit time to read all of that so my lawyer took that paper and told me to not sign. They wanted me to sign that so they have legal grounds to visit my home every week uninvited to see how I am doing with the kids. My lawyer attacked them that they are doing this for their bonuses and that they don't have any legal right to ask me to sign this and that they can call whoever they want. They said they will contact their supervisors and that police will probably contact me. I left immediately, no one contacted me still. My wife stormed after me and begged me again to talk, I just drove off.

When my kids came home, I talked with them about everything what happened. They told me they heard my wife in the tuesday when I sent her that message how she cries and begs me to listen to her so they know it's her fault. Smart little kids...I drove them on the football practice, my daugher was with Melody. She likes her a lot. My sons even helped Melody to clean after they ate and they wouldn't do that with my wife so I think deep down they know they need to behave as best as possible and help me during this time. Again, my wife calls me 24/7. I think she should be in the Guinness World Records for the most calls made and messages sent.

Today it was much better day. Everything in the school was good. My daughter stayed at home because they have free day today. Melody is making her hair, they sing...they are great duo for now. My wife's friend called me in the afternoon that my wife wants to see kids. I told her it's okay. They arrived and my wife immediately saw I changed the gates. My daughter was very happy to see her. Wife was crying when she saw her, she was waiting for my sons. And both of them told her they don't want to be with her now. I told them to talk a little bit with her because she was crying literally on the street but they refused and went in their bedroom and later to play with their friends on the street. I told her to leave and she begged me again to give her chance to tell me everything.

I told her that she needs to wait to talk with me until I receive DNA tests. She put my daughter on the ground and just looked at me for 10 seconds completely frozen. Honestly, I thought at those moments kids are not mine. She was shocked and said kids are mine and she can't believe I am saying this. I really think this was the moment when she finally realized what she did. She told me again kids are mine and she jumped in the car. I talked a little bit with her friend, I could see my wife is crying like crazy. They left after that.

My wife's friend brought my daughter back. She said my wife locked herself in the bedroom. She called her parents to confess everything and she is in the state of shock that I've tested our kids. Kids are mine, she never looked at anyone during the marriage except AP...My wife told her friend that she can't believe what she did and that she knows now she lost everything when I did the DNA tests because that's very extreme and she thinks I don't trust her anything. Her parents called me tonight. To say they are furious is understatement. Her mom begged me to not cut the contact between them and my kids. I said they can always call them and come here but that I will not allow my kids to leave Asia before we divorce. She is fine with that and thanked me. Her father told me she is not welcome anymore in their home. They are disgusted she could do something like this and he told her to not call them anymore. They are very conservative, 40+ years in the marriage so this was kinda expected. Her older brother told me the same. That he blocked her and that he is disgusted that she is his sister. They all gave me full support and told me to inform them about everything. They facetimed a little bit with my kids and they had good time.

That's about that. Hopefully weekend will me much easier. I am very tired. Mentally but physically also. We go tomorrow to watch football game with my friend's family and hopefully my wife will give me some peace. Since I told her about DNA tests she didn't call me anymore so that's at least something good. I am waiting for the DNA results. My younger son has 7th birthday in the next saturday so that will be also again one huge pain in the ass to be around my wife, but it is what it is. Thank you for your advices and nice words.

[UPDATE - Kids are mine!!!](https://www.reddit.com/user/OutrageousSpread8706/comments/1fugjua/update_kids_are_mine/) -  2 October 2024

Hello, hello...yes, I am the father! I mean, I knew 99% kids are mine but you never know. At the end, I thought my wife is loyal woman but she isn't! I can say I can breathe with the full lungs finally. Now everything is easier. When I received results today I was so scared to read it. I needed to take 10 minutes before I actually saw the results. Damn, if someone told me this will be my life....but here we are. I started to work today again. Melody is taking care of everything. My friend and his wife are there to help her. She sent me pictures of my kids when she drove them from the school and when they were eating. She is really good and kids love her. Well these last 5 days were really tough mentally so let me start.

Weekend - my wife didn't call me at all since I told her about DNA tests. She was still sending me messages but didn't call. Her friend told me she looks like shit and behaves like she has mental breakdown. She would send me about 30 messages per day(before it was 150-200 at least). Mostly were something like this ""Good morning, have a great day, I am so sorry for everything, please call me if you have any desire"", ""I am so proud of you how you are taking care of everything"", ""I can't express how sorry I am for everything. I wish I never went out that night, I wish I told you immediately...""

She would sometimes change the words, but the context would be the same. And she would send me some pictures of us and kids from the past, from the vacations, us all being on the couch, in the restuarants...etc. I have to say that until yesterday she would just facetime with my daughter(sons still refuse) everyday, but she didn't come to pick her up. Idk why, but as her friend says she just doesn't seem normal right now. Well, my brother called me in the saturday. I didn't tell him or anyone in my family what is going on. Whenever they would call to see my kids, me and my wife I would have some excuse why my wife isn't near me. I knew she didn't tell them...until she actually did. So my brother called me and he told me she confessed everything. He was shocked and couldn't believe. He thought we are joking with him. Yes people, with all the evidences still no one can believe. I think people would rather believe she became president of the USA than this. That's how shocking and how big betrayal this is. My brother's wife is very close to my wife. After she heard about all of this she cut every contact with her (my brother did the same). At first I thought she did it because of me, to show me support even though as I said they are really close. But no, she did it also because she is also disgusted by her and doesn't want to see person like her around my brother/her husband. I actually laughed at this, but I appreciated support. So my wife lost one of the last people she could call.

My brother told me they will try come to see me soon so I am glad. Then my parents called me. My wife told them also everything. My father supports every decision I make and he tells me just to do the best for me and the kids. On the other hand my mother tells me I should forgive my wife because she is human and did the mistake, she is remorseful, ready to do anything and ""1 mistake should not be enough to forget on 11 years of love and 3 kids she gave me""....I told her immediately that it wasn't 1 mistake, but 4 mistakes in one month duration. Her answer was ""you should ask yourself why did she do that. Was everything ok with you 2?"" I hung up immediately. I love my mom. After kids she is by far the most important person in my life and I would do everything for her. She saved my life when I was younger and having so many problems. If she wasn't my mother I would be in the grave or on the street and she is my guardian angel. But I just can't believe she could say something like that. Then my father attacked her why is she defending cheaters...my mother apologized immediately, she ""just thinks about what is best for my kids"" and told me whatever I decide she also supports. I didn't have enough energy to talk anymore. Wife's parents and her brother still don't talk with her and actually told me that they will call her friend to tell her that they will send remaining stuff she has in her own country to her and that she is not allowed to enter their house anymore.

If we forget on all of this, weekend was actually really good. We went with my friend's family to watch football game. Went shopping, kids were laughing and smiling at that's what is most important.

Now, another chaos with my wife. You remember how I told you she stopped calling me? Eh, it didn't last long. I need to add a little bit context here. My 1st assistant at the work for the last 15-16 months is ""Sarah"", 29. She is great worker, professional, very smart and kind person. But she is also really attractive and since she moved here and since she works with me also single. I told my wife about her before she started to work with me. My previous assistant was a guy. She was okay with that, nothing special, until she saw how she looks and that she is single. Then she became cautious (irony, huh?). Sarah would sometimes send me messages during the night (9PM...and always about work but she would wish me good night as my wife would say in a weird way) and my wife would be very angry and insecure about that(irony, huh, 2.0.). Then she would sometimes come at my workplace with the kids without calling me. I didn't have any problem with that since she would do this also before when I didn't work with Sarah, but now she was doing this firstly to see how me and Sarah would react. Anyway, with the time her jealousy decreased because I assured her nothing is going on. But she was concerned about her intentions and she would say she can see Sarah is ""eating me with the eyes"" and my wife never liked her and was really cold whenever them 2 would be near each other...

This monday we had really important event in our company. Me and Sarah were always in the contact since I took days off the work. I told her it's about personal reasons and she wished me all the best. I didn't want to go on that event but eventually they told me to come. I asked Sarah does she want me to pick her up. I know how this sounds but I have my reasons why I asked her: Event was in the hall in the different part of the city and I literally needed to drive near her apartment complex to come there, she doesn't drive, I never picked her up before because of my wife, she was working extra since I am at home and she was doing basically my job for free and never said a thing. At the end, I don't need to explain anything to my wife. I can pick up 10000 girls now if I want. I picked her up, we talked, came on the event, we were on the same dinner table with 6 more people. I drove her back home, she wished me good night, I did the same and went home.

Melody was there, I wished her good night, my kids were sleeping and I went in my bedroom. And then I went to see messages on the whatsapp. I turned off all notifications from Viber, Line, Whatsapp, Telegram because my phone is melting when my wife starts with her calls and messages. And there I saw a lot of messages from my wife and her friend. I checked messages from her friend and basically she told me my wife is going crazy and having mental breakdown because someone told her that me and Sarah were really close and enjoying time together on that event. I asked her immediately who told her that and she told me she can't tell me. My wife was saying how I changed her for ""younger (irony, huh, 3.0.), smarter and more attractive ""model"""". How my kids were going to have ""young stepmom who will be with me whole day because we work together and are very likely already together."" I just started to laugh and said that I don't have time for this nonsense. If there is one thing that I really don't care now and is not on my mind then it is having any relationship with any woman now. Even if I did something and I didn't, I don't owe her shit. I was loyal more than 11 years to her and to be honest, I had much more situations where girls were approaching me thinking I am single than guys looking/approaching her and she fucked up, not me.

I went under the shower and I was just asking myself who told her this. My wife is not close to anyone from my work. She doesn't talk with anyone. The only person that knows about my situation from the work is my female co-worker that recommended me Melody. She is really close to me and she had horrible things to say about my wife after I told her everything and she didn't say anything to anyone 100%. I just said to myself someone from the work that doesn't like me sent her message probably from the burner account and that's it.

I called Sarah and told her we need to see each other tomorrow. And yesterday we went on the coffee and I told her everything about my wife. She was shocked who could say something like that. I told her everything because of few reasons. I expected my wife to call her and have another lunatic episode. Luckily she didn't. I wouldn't lose my job at all if this is even true between us but I don't want that someone is saying complete lies about me. Also, why would anyone talk lies about her? She is sleeping with her boss and that's why she has a job...and also I didn't want to hear any rumour that my infidelity is the reason for my divorce and with that possibly can ruin my chances during divorce process.

She told me she will tell me if she hears anything and today when I returned at the job everything was perfect. My wife started to call me again every 5 minutes. She constantly cries, begs for new chance, she will do everything, whatever I want...she came yesterday to see kids. My sons were on the football practice, but she took our daughter. When she brought our daughter back she tried to ask me few questions about Sarah but I left immediately. I don't need to explain myself to her at all. But the thing I do notice about her is that she lost definitely some weight (her friend tells me my wife refuses to eat) and bags under her eyes look like she is crackhead.

In friday my younger son turns 7. But he will celebrate in saturday with his friends and other kids in our house. My wife will be there and her being around me for few hours is one huge disaster in the making but I will try to stay calm because of my kids. In sunday I plan to confront her 1 on 1 about DNA results and offer her deal about her future so I will update after that probably.

I promised myself this won't be long but it is long...sorry guys, apparently I am not capable to make long story short. Thank you for your nice messages and comments like always and take care!

[UPDATE - Son's birthday and my mental breakdown](https://www.reddit.com/user/OutrageousSpread8706/comments/1fwsdhn/update_sons_birthday_and_my_mental_breakdown/) 5 October 2024

Hi everyone. I said I will update after I speak with my wife in sunday about everything but I actually already did it or maybe did it. It will be a long post so feel free to skip it. If no one reads it I am okay. I feel better when I write this because I am feeling the worst ever so at least I can vent here.

In thursday my wife called me can she take our daughter for the sleepover. Our daughter doesn't go in the kindergarten in friday so she is free. I told her she can. She came and again she tried a little talk with me but I didn't want anything. She wanted to talk but I told her to leave. But she asked me can she talk a little bit with our younger son since he will turn 7 next day. I called him and he came. He was standing away from her but he was listening to her. She told him how she already bought him gifts and how much she loves him. Eventually she hugged him and kissed him but he didn't respond. He literally didn't say a word and just left while she was standing there. My older son still refuses to see her let alone talk with her. She left with our daughter and promised they will be back until 5pm tomorrow. So about 24 hours they will be together. She was sending me a lot of pictures how they are making pancakes, sleeping together and are playing together. And also sent me so many messages how she regrets this is not happening with all 5 of us right now.

Yesterday (friday) my son became grown man! He is 7. I woke him up and me and my older son congratulated him. He was really happy and in a good mood. I drove them to the school and went to work. While I was working my wife called me again asking can she spend afternoon and evening with our son and daughter. She assumed older son will refuse. Again, I said she can. She was texting me through the day that she planned everything and I know she was excited. They will go eat, then they will go in the amusment park, they will drive go-kart then go on ice creams. I liked everything. To be honest my younger son in my eyes suffers the most with this situation. While my daughter is very young and unaware of anything and sees her mother a lot and my older son is very clear that he doesn't want to have contact with my wife, the younger son is very quiet and looks very confused. So I liked the idea of them 3 spending time together.

I specifically told her to not enter the house and wait for me because I need to talk with him firstly and I need to see his reaction. I don't want to force him on anything. She agreed and told me she will wait me. I had to stay a little bit more at the workplace and my friend and his wife were waiting for me in my house so they can go with me to buy everything I needed for the birthday: food, drinks, cakes, gifts... I texted my wife and told her I left my workplace a little bit late and that there is big traffic in the city so I will be late. She told me she is close to my house but she will wait me. I called my friend and told him that my wife is coming. I also called Melody to prepare another clothes for my daughter and asked her what my sons are doing.

Everything what happened after that I didn't see. Melody, friend and his wife told me this and I believe them 100%. My wife arrived with her friend and our daughter. Apparently my daughter invited her in the house to show her something(according to my wife's friend). My friend and his wife with my sons were inside of the house then. Melody was in the backyard and stopped her from entering the house. My wife started to fight with Melody ""who is she to forbid her to enter the house with her daughter""...friend's wife heard the noise and went out. Friend's wife and my wife were friends but she doesn't talk with her anymore after I told her what happened. She told her to calm down and to respect my decision. Wife was much more calm and kind towards friend's wife than she was with Melody. My daughter was then calling her again from the door to come and they again stopped her from the entering the house. My wife's friend told her to wait for me in the street. And then my older son stormed from the house. Started to yell at her that no one loves her, to get out of here, that we are happy without her and ""daddy is happy without you"" and that everyone hates her. She started to cry and begged him to talk with her but he was yelling like crazy at her. She left the gifts for my younger son and went with her friend in the car. Then my older son took those gifts and threw it on the street while they were in the car. My friend then put him in the house. According to friend's wife my wife left crying like crazy.

I came home, didn't see wife and then they told me everything. I couldn't believe. All my kids were always kind, nice, not spoiled and never rude. My older son was always a little bit more connected with me but he never ever told anything rude to my wife before all of this and he always loved her so much. So I told him to come in my room. I literally asked him is he normal. He apologized to me and said he couldn't listen to her anymore. I told him he should never ever talk like that with his mother and that those gifts aren't for him and that he doesn't need to apologize to me but to his mother and brother. He started to cry saying I am forcing him to call my wife and that he won't talk with her because he hates her. I was speechless. I know he needs therapy and I will solve that really soon. He apologized to his brother.

Then I spoke with younger son. I asked him does he want to see his mother on the birthday tomorrow and he said he doesn't. I asked him few times is he sure and he said he is. He also refused to see gifts from her and told me to give her back everything she bought. So I called wife's friend to tell her about this. She told me my wife is having panic attack and struggles to breathe. After 2 hours she called me that she needed to call 2 of her own friends because of my wife and that she is sleeping now after she took some pills.

Today when I woke up I saw messages from my wife. She basically told me she doesn't want to live anymore. She can't live without us and she wants to leave and left me and our 3 kids alone. I called her and told her that I will send her pictures and videos from the birthday but to not disturb me today and that I will talk with both sons after this. She thanked me and again she was saying how sorry she is. A lot of kids came on the birthday. Also friends from my older son and my daughter. So many parents. My friends with their kids.

I was just looking at all those couples how they are smiling and enjoying together while I am trying to pretend everything is ok. What my life turned into...I really wanted to vomit then. I just wanted birthday to finish as soon as possible. When Melody left as the last one and my kids were in the living room opening the gifts I went in the garage and I called my wife.

I told her to not interrupt me and to shut up. I was screaming, yelling, crying, sarcastically laughing for about 5 minutes. And I told her so many bad things. I didn't curse all people in the world together as much as I did her. I told her the worst things. And I don't regret anything I said to her. She didn't interrupt me but I could hear her crying. When I finished with my part she just said ""I am so sorry, I will do anything"" and kept crying. I wanted to break my phone in that moment. Just told her to fuck off and I ended the call.

Now, I am sitting in the dark bedroom and I am writing this. I am just asking myself what the fuck did I do to deserve this. Is this karma for my crazy behaviour when I was younger? I guess I will never know. I was always problematic kid. Good in school, horrible out of school. I was running from the house so I could be with my girlfriend, I was stealing money from the parents...my mom came on the idea that I should start practicing taekwondo so I could release all my energy there. Boy she was wrong. I started to fight every day and I ended up few times in the police.. Then I went on the college. I became friend with wrong people...I would have exams in 9am and I would stay in casino till 6am playing poker tournaments or blackjack or I would just drink and go in the nightclubs with the friends and girls.

Then I met my wife. She came to work in my country. Some guys had eyes on her, but she was shy and I was complete mess but for some reason she liked me. 3 months after she had to go back in her country but she decided to stay with me. She gave me almost all of her savings so I can pay my debts after about 5 months of relationship. I really thought she is insane for doing that...I still do. But she did change my life and I changed myself because of her. We left about 10 months after for Asia. I will never forget first apartment where we lived. It was the biggest shithole I have ever lived or maybe even saw. I've no idea how we lived there for 8 months. But we were saving money and we were really happy...now, I have house, cars, money and I am not happy. I don't want to sound arrogant but girls always says I am good looking guy, in the great shape, I am working out 3, 4 times per week, I have great job, career...and I know I can find new gf/wife easily...but I seriously think I will never ever marry again. I will never trust anyone 100%. I know this might be temporary feeling and that life is full of challenges and I should be happy because my kids, parents, brother, SIL, nephews, friends are all healthy and love me but I am really tired and empty...

Sometimes I just want to give up but then I remember I have 3 kids...everyone around me expects me to be some kind of magician who is expected do everything good for everyone around me. Everyone expects me to suffer in silence and to not say a shit what is going through my head....""do best for your kids"", ""take care of your wife"", ""maybe she will do something to herself"", ""do that, don't do that"", ""forgive her! Go on MC!"", ""Don't forgive her, destroy her"", ""forgive her because of the kids and in some time you will love her again!"", ""fuck her, don't forgive her, kids are better with you and without her"".....I am so tired

Tomorrow is just day for me and kids.

Thank you all

1g2mo32,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1g2mo32/entitled_assistant_gets_arrested_after_refusing/,Entitled Assistant Gets Arrested after refusing to be let go. ,"Hello again incredible people of the Charlotte Dobre Reddit page!
A few days ago I posted an AITA for wanting to fire my new assistant. After reading all your helpful comments I realized that keeping her would cause more harm than letting her go.

Here is the UPDATE on how horribly it went. 

Today I asked my assistant to come into my office for a meeting at 9am, when she gets to work. She replying to me saying she doesn't 'Do' Sundays and if I wanted to have a meeting with her it could wait for Monday morning. I reminded her that the company works on Sundays since Fridays and Saturdays we are off and Thursday is a half day.  I also reminded her that she happily agreed to these terms when she was hired. 
She then had the nerve to ask me, ""How much extra will I be getting for coming in today?
Me: ""There is no pay for coming in on Sunday, it's considered a work day remember?"", I answered trying to keep my cool. 
She answered with, "" But Catarina (our religious Christian receptionist) gets Sundays off! It's not fair why do I have to come in while the receptionist doesn’t! I out ranked her, don’t I?""
This is where I lost all willingness to try and be civil spoken! 
Me: ""Ok listen since you are obviously refusing to come in, consider your position at this company terminated. Your last paycheck will be sent to you, good luck at your future place of employment, Goodbye"" 
She went NUCLEAR! Going on about how I don’t have the authorization to fire her (she is my assistance), How I am jealous of her and how she will be calling the company owner and I would be the one fired for this. 
I said, ""Sure go ahead, best of luck"", and hung up the phone. 
Less then 10 min after I hung up the phone, she showed up at my office demanding an explanation on why she was being let go after all the hard work she had done this past month. Her voice was so loud it disturbed a meeting the owner was having with a CEO of a major hotel company, causing him to come into my office to see what was going on. 
When he entered, she automatically started with the crocodile tears, saying she had been over worked and under paid this whole month and that I didn’t inform her of the job requirements when she was hired because I had something against her. 
My boss looked at her like a crazy person for a moment or two and then said;
""As I remember I was the one who hired you. I was also the one who informed you of the requirements of the position and you accepted. I do not appreciate being lied to or manipulated.""
He then turned to me and calmly asked me to post another ad for an assistant, ask she was standing there, fake crying her eyes out.    
She started yelling about how we were being unfair and how we were the ones manipulating her by making her work so hard and ending up with no job. 
I asked her to leave my office, but instead she sat at my desk, demanding that she should have my job as she had gone to a better university then me and I am just a drop out who doesn’t deserve my job. I kindly reminded her that I have 10 years of experience under my belt and that she had 5 min to leave my office before security removes her from the building. 
She refused to budge. I called security and went out for an early lunch at a close by spot I loved, hopefully they would manage to deal with her.
 On my way I ran into Catarina coming back from church and had to tell her what happened. So, I invited her to lunch, knowing that after at least 2 hours at church she must be starving. 
I told her about everything that had happened that morning and she didn’t seem shocked to hear it at all, she actually looked very relieved. I asked Catarina if she acted in the same manner when I was away and she just nodded yes. 
For context, Catarina is a very religious woman who prefers to never speak badly about a single soul, even if they are horrible to her. I am the exact opposite. 
After a few moments of preying it out of her, Catarina told me about how the assistance was sure that Catarina as supposed to be her assistant and how she had been extremely rude to her while I wasn’t around.  
I Apologized to her for having to go through such a horrible work day, paid for our meal and asked if she wanted to walk back with me to the office and I would drive her home instead of her taking the bus since she didn’t drive. She accepted and we went back to the office. 
When we arrived, it looked like a crime scene done wrong! 3 Police squad cars where parked at the entrance to my buildings blocking my car. We had apparently show up just in time to see my former assistance being dragged out in handcuffs after throwing hot coffee at the security guard and locking herself in my office. The owner of the company was down stairs speaking to an officer. When he spotted me, he came over to inform me that my office had been trashed, my computer screen was broken, my camera lenses were smashed and that the company will be pressing charges and replacing everything. However, since my office was now a crime scene and I had no computer to work from that I should take the day off. 
I gladly accepted the offer for a paid day off and decided to take the security guard who got coffee thrown at them for a beer on the beach and a mocktail for Catarina (since Baptists apparently don’t drink).
All in all, not a good ending to a horrible month.

P.S. - English isn't my first language and I wrote this while getting hammered on the beach after she trashed my office.

1g2mnxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g2mnxh/aitah_because_i_dont_want_to_continue_friendship/,AITAH because I don’t want to continue friendship?,"I’ve been in contact with a woman I met at a social event a couple of years ago. When we first met she expressed how she wanted to be friends and how life was lonely and it’s important to make friends your chosen family. We since met a few times and exchange occasional „how are you”, but mostly she or I reach out with a proposition of grabbing a coffee or lunch. I noticed the meetups happen only if her list of criteria is met. To my invitation it’s never just a straight „nice, see you then and there”, instead she first says yes, to then later start a demand list or change the plan last minute. One of the times I was excited to meet her at an event I invited her to join me for, and when it turned out she went to a completely different place I was baffled. I offered we could still make things work and meet some other place halfway. Nothing I suggested was good. The place must be in a certain area for her and it must serve a particular type of dish. So again, it was like jumping hoops only to make a casual meetup work (plus me giving up the event I was excited for). And it’s like this every time. It finally got to me: meeting her, making it work that we even do meet, is always a stress or a disappointment. Let me mention that she’s very direct in her language when she dismissed cafe’s and venues I propose to meet at: „I have no interest in this cafe”, „I don’t think this is a nice place”, „I don’t care for…” - Maybe I’m weird, but to me the whole point of a 2h meeting is more about us catching up and having a good chat… When she found out I’m an avid hiker and often go to nature, she expressed she wanted to join. She actually not only expressed this, she complained I was inviting someone else to go hike together and not her. So when I finally invited her, I tried to make it a very short and easy hike and near the town for this first time, knowing she’s very picky and doesn’t strike me as a nature person. The shortest route was under 2h. I was right. When I asked if she was going to be okay with a 2h walk, she said this was definitely way too far for her. She was also rude when I tried to be helpful and shared the exact location and instruction for the meeting point with her. „I don’t know what it is you’re saying, I’m gonna be at this point”. I responded saying I’d find her when she arrives. In the end, on the very day, she texted saying she was going to do something else because what I proposed doesn’t interest her. It’s become clear to me that she’s neither particularly kind, nor warm (at all) or interested in hanging out together. I feel the more soft and flexible I am, the more fussy she is. I feel somehow repulsed by her behaviour and being difficult any time we interact and try to meet. The way I feel it’s frustrating and unpleasant to even try to meet. Am I the arse for planning never to respond to future texts? The whole acquaintance has been so barren, I don’t feel trying to explain how her behaviour makes me feel will yield anything good.",9,1728815159.0,AITAH,11,1.0,False

So, i got an Geforce GTZ 1660 super and the dual monitor function has never been working proberly.

-/skip if you dont need info on the old GPUs problem-

and i belive a few years back, when i looked up what the problem could be, is that alot have the same problem with this card and no real solution as to what it could be.  
reinstalling drivers, at times worked, restarting the PC, shutting it down and booting it up again all of those worked very rare, but the PC would go back to not being able to find the second monitor.

what worked the most for me, has been pulling out the cable for the second monitor and inserting it again, wiggeling it a little while doing so. untill it found the monitor.

-skip/-

I got no clue what card to buy, as im not really looking for an upgrade as such. but just a card in the same range and can support 2 monitors, 1 for the games and the other for netflix/browsering the webs and such.

  
I hope i kind soul can help me point me to a decent card that can work on my setup.
