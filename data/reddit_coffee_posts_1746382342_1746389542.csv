I liked the simple design and was looking forward to using it. Fast-forward a week later I’m in my car and I’m trying to take a drink from the Tumblr and I can’t even get any liquid out unless my neck is almost all the way back. Why? Because the lid latch hits your nose when you’re trying to drink and makes it impossible to get any beverage out without getting a crick in your neck. I don’t know about you, but I’d like to take my coffee with me, especially on my morning commute. The design of this mug makes it impossible to have a sip of coffee without taking it not only your eyes, but your entire face off of the road. Am I the only one that has this pet peeve?

1ket30w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ket30w/aitha_for_asking_if_she_was_feeling_ok_after_she/,AITHA for asking if she was feeling ok after she cancelled meet for being hungover,"Hello, so I met a women online, We agreed from first talking that the relationship would only be casual ongoing sex, we met for a coffee for a vibe check which went well. Arranged a meet day and time which worked for both of us, she sends me a lot of VERY sexual texts and photos all week prior to meet day.

Day of meet she says she is feeling really hungover, I say this is fine and suggest we rearrange for two days later, she says that day will work, I ask what times that day she can do, she says she will get back to me when she feels better.

Next morning I text her “good morning, hope you’re feeling better” she leaves on read, I double text an hour later “how’s your head feeling haha”, she responds saying she feels I am pressuring her to meet and goes off saying about how she’s not obligated to meet me and that she didn’t want to be chased and pressured when she was sick and that she didn’t believe my text was genuine and I only wanted to know if the meet was happening.

I think my text, although was intentional to keep the conversation going from day before to rearrange a time and date when she was feeling better, was pretty normal/human thing to say in this scenario and shouldn’t of been taken like I was spamming her messages and maliciously pressing her to rearrange when she’s sick, I’m not sure why she’s saying I think she should be obligated to meet.

all texts about when/how/where about meeting was mutual and she lead on talking about sex, saying how she wanted to meet and was excited to meet etc.

It was two short sentences saying good morning how are you feeling and a sarcastic question responding to a text she said she had a headache, these texts where in line with the amount we texted normally every day since we met online

So I am still confused about her response really.

I feel that I've hit a plateau on the diet though. Feels like no change in fat loss for months. My typical daily routine is whey protein w/black coffee in the am (my cheat on bbbe) lunch and dinner are both 4 eggs + 5oz of beef with about 2 tbs of butter.
Thoughts are that I need to add fat to the protein in the morning to keep the ketosis going but I'm not sure. Before you ask, I don't have dairy and hold really strict to the diet outside of the additional whey protein in the AM and a bit of avacado here and there( like twoce a month at most). Just hard to have time to cook in the morning and i felt i needed additional protein for muscle gain.

\### Training

I didn't follow a specific training plan. I just started ramping up distance week over week for 12 weeks (was forced to start then since snow made it impossible to run for a week in January). I followed Garmin Daily Suggested Workouts at minimum and made sure to get a couple of quality tempo, interval, or threshold sessions and a long run in each week. The most I ran in a week was \~139 km. The longest run I did was 37.25km. I ran lots of hills in preparation for the crazy climb in this race (298m), I exceeded the elevation gain on two of my training runs. I did a half marathon race, my first ever half race, in March (also in Cincinnati - Cincinnati Heart Half) and ran an 84:06 (24th overall!). I did a two week taper. My last long run was about 3 weeks out at 30.30 km. I never took more than 1 rest day at a time. Somehow only got one mild stomach bug during the 12 weeks of training, amiracle as a parent of a toddler!



\### Pre-race

My in-laws live in Cincinnati so I stayed at their house and was able to get a ride to the race from my father-in-law. Got up around 4, drank a couple cups of coffee. I ate a yogurt, a honey stinger, and another brand of Stroopwafel. Had a dry herb vape walking over to the starting line (nothing new on race day!). I did some dynamic stretching, some pogo hops, skips, and a \~10 minute shuffle before heading to the corral. I was a little annoyed being further back than I wanted. The half race goes out at the same time as the full so it was pretty packed in there. At least I was ahead of the 3:10 pacer group. I couldn't see the 3:05 pacer group there was supposed to be. It's a shame they didn't have an official sub-3 group. Having a pacer for sub 3 would have been a big help for me. Had some honey stinger chews and a Maurten 100 before the race. I drank two 18 oz bottles of water with pedialyte over the two hours pre race. Race started at 6:30.



\### Race

What a rollercoaster race! Probably took the first 5k way too fast. Made an effort to dial it back somewhat to get through 7-13 km where most of the climb is. Started cramping in my right hamstring and calf in the middle of 17km. New goal became to just finish the race so I slowed down for a bit and after some Gatorade and water it abated a little. Thought I was going to throw up around 21 km, fueling plan went out the window. Just thinking about more gel made me queazy , I think I had about 3 (two Maurtens and a caffine GU; at like 5km, maybe 14?, and maybe around 18km?) up to that point while running. Stuck with Gatorade for the rest of the race. Making sure I drank a lot eased the cramping and I got a little second wind seeing my wife, my two-year-old daughter, and my wife's family in Mariemont. Kept it steady in the last \~12 km. Managed to kick in the last 2 k. Delighted with the result! 



\### Post-race

I got my medal, mylar blanket, cried a little, got my bag, and found a porta potty to change into some dry clothes. My legs were/are so sore. I have a couple of blisters on my toes, but my calves and ankles were/are so stiff after going the distance. It was cold and rainy after so I didn't stick around long. Had a dry herb vape, got a Lime scooter and went a couple of blocks to get a Lyft back to the in-laws. 



I think I'm going to target shorter distances for a while before trying the marathon again. If I ever run another, I'm choosing a flatter course. Also, I'll probably cave and get some super shoes. I ran this and all my training in Xero Prios. I like running in Prios because I tend to not roll my ankle in them (has been a problem for me in the past). I know I can break 3 and maybe BQ if training goes as well as it did this time, I run a flatter course, and maybe wear some shoes with carbon plates. I'll try to add more peak weekly distance and speed work next time. I think I followed Garmin's suggestions too much - too many 'Base Runs' in Garmin's Z3 (\~140bpm-163) for me. I want to break 18 in the 5km, see how quick I can get my mile, and eventually break 80 mins in the half marathon before trying a marathon again.

1keso3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortugalExpats/comments/1keso3d/what_is_dating_like_for_a_heterosexual_man_in_his/,What is dating like for a heterosexual man in his early 20s in Portugal(especially Lisbon and Porto)?,"I am an Egyptian young man who is thinking of moving to Portugal on the digital nomad visa. The nature of the dating scene and culture is a very important factor in my decision. I've researched online a lot and I didn't really get a clear idea of what it could be like for me there. I know I can't know for sure until I am there, but I think I can get an approximation of the possibilities. 

My description: I have a Mediterranean look, dark curly hair and eyes, 176 cm tall (I guess these features are similar to the Portuguese average look), well-dressed, speak English with a degree of fluency, don't know Portuguese yet, born and raised Christian so I'm familiar with the cultural background of the society, work as a solopreneur with a decent income, could be very friendly, fun to be around and social when I turn on the charm :). 

Now, I know that I am kinda attractive from the feedback and chemistry I had with some of the women I already interacted with, and I think I am, considering personality and other non-physical attributes, in the top 15-5 % of my society's dating pool. But for various reasons, I think I need to relocate and explore a different place with a different life.

My goals: I am looking to do some casual dating (notice not casual sex) and maybe if I find a special person, we could move to something more serious. I am a very emotional person and I am not looking to score or sleep with as many as I can. I also not looking to find the one and settle down right away. I want things to go slowly and naturally as the relationship progresses. And I also want to have many attractive options so I can choose the persons I really can make special connections with.

With these attributes and goals, do you think I have a good chance in Portugal (especially in the big cities like Lisbon and Porto)? I've heard it's hard to date native Portuguese women as they're a bit closed and prefer Portuguese men. Note, here, I am talking about the majority, not the exceptional minority. I also hear they are looking to settle down and date to marry. I don't mind this point but, for me, that's a decision that could take months if not years to arrive at, I don't want to promise or commit to anything right away (so it would be more about enjoying each other's company, and not future planning in the beginning). I am more American-leaning in this regard. Again, I also don't speak Portuguese, and I know it would take me a long time to arrive at the level of proficiency that I'd be comfortable with. 

I also heard that it's better to date ex-pats and foreigners, but I am not sure if there are as many foreign young women (as I am fairly young myself) who come to Portugal for work or otherwise, so I could have the sufficient optionality and options to choose and screen comfortably. I don't mind dating older women, I just don't want to date them exclusively.

I'd like to be in a culture in which I'd be able to strike out conversations with strangers that I feel have some chemistry with (like in a coffee shop, working space, park, wherever...) and I'd like that this conversation might lead to me taking her phone number and planing a date if she's comfortable with it. I don't want to have to have an already some preexisting connection so I'd really be able to talk with her and she'd be comfortable with it (again, given there's mutual attraction, eye contact, smiles, light chit-chat and vibe going on. I am not a creep). That should be, I know, in addition to social circles, but social circles can't be my main source of leads. I also don't care for nightlife or drinking.

I didn't say much about dating apps because I don't prefer them. I prefer the in-person spark. But I guess I'll use them too. Do you think from what you've read, dating apps in Portugal would be valuable for me?

1keslrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1keslrk/girl_i_met_with_a_bf_advice/,Girl I met with a BF advice,"So…an unusual scenario happened a few days ago.  I live in a popular southern US city and our building downtown was without power for most of the day.  A few residents such as myself went next door to a cool brunch/lunch spot to kill some time, charge devices, etc.  Posted up at the bar as they have a few outlets under it.  Sat next to a girl who also was in the same predicament.  We quickly started talking about the power issues then to foodie stuff, etc.  Fun vibe. Total stunner but with a bit of a southern belle Barbie vibe.  She was definitely a few margs in too.  

BF then showed up.  He was in/out checking on their dog they left with the concierge woman who adores the little thing and other errands.  We all talk for a bit more.  She wears the pants for sure.  He’s a finance bro type.  Nice guy but definitely sort of meek, uncultured, minimal palate type, etc.  That’s important here as she’s a HUGE foodie like me.  
Also some recipe discussion as we both love to cook.

More margs flow.  I’m just doing coffee since I had a late night previously.  Trying to eat my meal but she just won’t shut up with asking my favorite spots, if I’ve been here/there, etc.  BF left for another errand and she then proceeds to ask for my number and IG.  Also is making fun of him a bit since he doesn’t like a lot of foods and is bland (at least in that dept).  Then asks if I want to go with her to this sushi omakase event in a few weeks that the BF will be out of town for.  She’s definitely a bit tipsy at this point.  I’m friends with a few of the staff members/bartenders at this spot and I never sit down and eat a meal there.  Usually only  coffee.  I can tell they are getting a kick out of this whole interaction and probably also feel sorry for the BF.  Anyways, it was eventually time to leave.  Power back on.  We all parted ways.  Cool.  

Next day I get a text with a link from her for the actual invite/reservation.  I wasn’t really expecting much beyond the silly tipsy (for her) conversation at the bar.  I decide to roll with it.  Note: I won’t meddle with someone with a ring but if no ring then fair game.  No issues with potentially confiscating a girl even if I admit that could be a character flaw.  I also don’t think I could potentially date this girl.  She would be a lot to handle but not saying no either to short term devious fun.  I do like her though.  She wants to know my unit number (she asked the day before) and I texted her back saying we should try to hangout at some point before the event.  I also texted saying that we could pregame before the sushi event with some wine/cheese at my place as I like making little charcuterie boards and am a bit of a wine nerd.  She’s definitely excited and mentions again that it would just be the two of us at the event since the BF will be out of town.

What’s her motive here?  This hasn’t really happened to me where the girl is this forward with a BF.  Maybe it’s just platonic vibes but I doubt it.  Like I said…didn’t expect there to be any contact post restaurant and 99.9% sure they aren’t swingers.  Thoughts?  TIA!",1,1746388071.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1 City center, if you are familiar with the city, go to point 2 (590 m to the Central Street of the city Bolshaya Sadovaya, 790 to the Park im. Oktyabrskoy Revolyutsii, the park with the largest number of positive reviews in the city, the most popular attraction of the city ""One Sky"" and the most popular Drama Theater, 1.1 km to the best part of Pushkinskaya Street, the most beautiful and popular street of the city and the Musical Theater, 1 km to the Medical University, and so on).



2 Orthopedic and mattress and bed.



3 The upper 3rd floor of the house with a beautiful view from the windows.



4 Smoking area in the fresh air overlooking a huge green area from which the house is blown with clean air.



5 Free parking on the street with always free spaces and in the yard locked with a combination lock.



6 Gas stove and oven.



7 You can leave your luggage in our neighboring apartment until your train or until you enter the apartment from 6 to 22.



8 24-hour contactless check-in and check-out.



Number of guests: 1-4 people.



At your service is a double orthopedic bed with an orthopedic mattress 140 cm., air conditioning, a disassemblable double sofa 170 cm., TV, a huge wardrobe with a full-length mirror, a hair dryer, an iron, a coffee table, a mini refrigerator, a microwave, an electric and regular kettle, a gas stove with an oven, dishes, spoons, forks, knives, pots, a frying pan, kitchen furniture, a clothes hanger. You can also ask us for additional dishes, equipment, if something is missing (for example, a freezer), fortunately we are in the neighboring apartment!



Disadvantages:



1 The windows overlook a street with one-way, single-lane, but very active traffic, cars can wake you up as early as 7 am.



2 The left wall dividing the apartments in the kitchen is wooden (in the living rooms there are ordinary ones) and with an unused door to our apartment.



3 The rooms are adjacent.



4 It is usually hot in winter, since the heating pipes of the neighbor below also go through part of the apartment, but several tenants have already been satisfied with this at about +7 outside.



5 Probably poor soundproofing of the walls (we did not do noise and sound insulation during the renovation, but in old houses it is better than in new ones, as we understand).



6 The disassembled sofa takes up almost the entire hall, preventing access to the bathroom.



7 The kitchen is a grandma's renovation.

1kesky1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatioParadise/comments/1kesky1/find_out_why_the_yaheetech_outdoor_glider_review/,Find Out Why the Yaheetech Outdoor Glider Review is Perfect for Patio Relaxation,"The Yaheetech e06568ea-19bc-4459-afb4-331ca507d4dd 2-Seat Outdoor Glider exudes practicality and charm for those looking to upgrade their patio or garden space. As someone who spends a lot of time outdoors, I couldn’t resist putting this product to the test. With its sturdy build and modern design, this glider promises both functionality and aesthetics. But is it the right fit for everyone? Let me take you through my experience with the product.

**Attractive and Functional Design**  
This glider bench effortlessly blends modern style with ergonomic comfort. With a sleek brown steel frame, gray breathable mesh fabric, and a tempered glass center table, it sets the perfect tone for any outdoor space. The 59”D x 32”W x 40”H dimensions provide ample space, and as soon as I put it on my patio, it became a centerpiece. The compact center table is a real plus; it perfectly held my coffee mug and tablet during long outdoor reading sessions.

**Smooth Gliding Mechanism**  
This is where the product shines the most. Thanks to its all-metal gliding mechanism, the movement is smooth and steady. I was worried my drinks might topple over while gliding, but the bench swings gently, avoiding spills altogether. It’s soothing—a feature especially appreciated during morning coffees or late-night chats. Trust me, it doesn’t squeak or rattle, even under sustained use.

**Check [Yaheetech e06568ea-19bc-4459-afb4-331ca507d4dd] price on Amazon.**  

**Comfort Built for Long Stays**  
Comfort isn’t just a selling point here; it’s finely embedded in every element of this product. The taut Texteline mesh gives excellent support to your body without feeling rigid. Additionally, the slightly reclined backrest provides great lumbar support, while the curved arms and waterfall seat edges make it suitable for hours of relaxation. In humid weather, the breathable mesh was a lifesaver as it kept me cool and dried quickly after a brief rain spell.

**Highlights**  
- Durable steel construction that supports up to 300 lbs per seat.  
- Weather-resistant and quick-drying Texteline material for outdoor performance.  
- Tempered glass table top for easy cleaning and added usability.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Assembly instructions could use more clarity; I found myself squinting at the pictures more than once.  
- The glider can seem firm at first for people used to cushioned seating.  

**Product Comparisons**  
When comparing this to similar gliders in this range, one standout competitor would be the Best Choice Products 2-person outdoor glider. While it offers similar weight capacity and a durable design, it lacks the built-in tempered glass center table Yaheetech includes, which is incredibly practical in daily use. On the other hand, the Best Choice Glider has a slightly cushier backrest, which could sway those prioritizing extra padding. Another strong rival is the Mainstays Steel Outdoor Bench, but it falls behind in offering gliding motion and ergonomic seat design.

**True Value**  
It’s always tricky to determine if a product justifies its price, but here’s my honest take. This glider provides a unique combination of comfort, quality, and practicality. You’re getting a fantastic balance of style and utility that many higher-priced options struggle to achieve. While it may not suit someone who wants plush seating, it delivers exceptional durability and charm for outdoor spaces.

1kesh85,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1kesh85/does_the_hommater_t1302ul_toaster_deliver/,Does the Hommater T1302-UL toaster deliver exceptional performance? Comprehensive review inside!,"Testing out the Hommater T1302-UL toaster has been an unexpectedly enjoyable experience in my daily breakfast routine. This product, marketed as compact and efficient, caught my eye after diving through heaps of reviews. Initially, the main allure for me was its sleek, black design and the promise of ""extra-wide slots."" Honestly, I was skeptical because, well, many toasters make big promises but often fizzle out when it's crunch time—literally. However, using this toaster gave me a sense of reliability I hadn’t experienced with some older models.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The minimalist, modern design was the first thing I noticed. Its compact size fits seamlessly into my counter space, making it an optimal choice for smaller kitchens or crowded countertops. It’s not overly flashy or ornate but has just the right amount of elegance to enhance the visual appeal of your kitchen. The black finish is painted on and gives it a polished look, though it does feel a bit plasticky to the touch. While testing it, I appreciated the thoughtful cord storage option underneath; keeping things tidy when you have limited space is a big win. The removable crumb tray also deserves praise—it’s incredibly easy to clean, and I’ve had no issues with crumbs piling up.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek and compact design easily fits into smaller kitchens.  
- Simple and efficient crumb tray cleaning.  
- Cord management feature keeps the area neat.

**Performance and Toast Customization**  
The performance of the toaster was mildly surprising. It comes with seven toast shade settings, giving precise control over crispness. As someone who prefers my bread lightly toasted while my partner craves dark, crispy edges, having such control avoids morning debates over who gets their toast done first. The Hommater toaster also has a self-centering rack, which ensures the bread slices toast evenly on both sides—a feature that worked wonders even with irregularly cut artisan bread. With the promised 750W of power output, I fast-tracked my entire breakfast-making routine.

Though marketed as a ""2-slice toaster,"" I love how versatile it is. Those extra-wide slots handle quirky breakfast choices like bagels, waffles, and even thickly cut slices of sourdough bread like a champ! Running late during work mornings became less stressful now that I can toast a bagel evenly on both sides while sipping my coffee.

***Time to see Hommater T1302-UL cost on Amazon.***  

**Safety Features and Build Practicality**  
Safety in kitchen appliances is often overlooked, but not with this model! From the anti-scald design to its BPA-free components, I could use it without worrying about burns or toxic materials—something that really matters for families with kids around. Its outer material remains surprisingly cool even after continuous use, which gives you peace of mind. Plus, no odd overheating incidents cropped up after extended sessions (I may or may not have overdone breakfast experiments one Saturday). To me, these safety enhancements are features worth highlighting, especially if you plan to leave this gadget within reach of younger family members.

**Areas for Improvement**  
Not everything about this toaster lives up to perfection. A couple of things bother me about its overall design and functionality:  
- Slots, while wide, might struggle with extremely large bread slices.  
- The black plastic material could feel sturdier, making some doubt its durability.  
- I personally found the toast shade dial a little stiff to adjust.

**Competitive Options**  
Browsing through alternative products, I tried to compare this toaster with another popular option, the Cuisinart CPT-122. While the Cuisinart boasts a stainless-steel build and similar settings, it lacks the compact charm and light weight of the Hommater variant. Another rival, the Breville BTA720XL, offers super smart features and variable-width slots, but its hefty price tag can make it inaccessible to budget-conscious users. What’s unbeatable about the Hommater T1302-UL is how it balances essential features like safety and simplicity while staying light on your wallet. If bells and whistles aren’t your thing, its utilitarian nature feels like a compelling argument.

**True Value**  
The pricing hits the sweet spot for what it offers, especially when compared to high-end toasters with features you likely don’t need. It becomes a solid piece for those looking for affordable quality. Paying for a toaster with basic reliability, safety guarantees, and customizable toasting options means it truly meets expectations for its price bracket. There are fancier toasters out there, sure, but do they handle everything from bagels to waffles with such ease while staying economical? Probably not.

1kesfw4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kesfw4,Joseph Tsar - Another Youtube Scammer?,"Hi fam,  
  
I recently realized I have been seemingly scammed by a YouTuber named [Joseph Tsar](https://www.youtube.com/@ttsar), who’s channel is dedicated to teaching people effective public speaking and improving articulacy. He is still actively posting content, with his [most recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyo2Gi7feM&t=3s) posted about a month ago. I'd love to get this in front of Coffee, and I'm wondering if there's a way to pressure this company into being transparent and fixing what they've done.  As you can see in the attached screenshots, I'm not the only one who's been affected.  
  
Context:

I’ve been a subscriber of Joseph’s channel for a few years now, and really enjoyed his content, which I found to be well crafted and providing applicable ideas for improving speech skills. I learned concepts related to improving vocabulary such as “surface lexicon” and “deep lexicon”, and how we can take words that are less common and make them accessible to our surface lexicon. He also had a series of videos analyzing the qualities of effective speakers and leaders which were quite good. Many of his videos have received hundreds of thousands if not millions of views, and his subscriber count has grown large. In an online world saturated with get-rich-quick grifters, I thought he was a great content creator and probably also a good guy. I'm not so sure anymore.   
  
About a year and a half ago (my estimation), Joseph announced he was launching a new platform called [Nounce.AI](http://Nounce.AI), which would be designed to actively work with users to improve their articulacy through various exercises and drills built off of AI tools. Being a fan of the channel, I naturally was very excited about this new tool and signed up as soon as I could for a trial. I liked the functionality and decided to upgrade to the pro plan for $9/month. I used it for a few weeks and was really enjoying it. According to my banking statements, I was first billed by Nounce on February 5, 2024.

After a few weeks I stopped using Nounce as often, and after a few months I completely stopped using it altogether (I'm the same way with Duolingo or anything else I attempt to do every day). It wasn't that I didn't like the platform, but life got busy and I moved on to other things. After several months I had almost entirely forgotten that I'd ever signed up for Nounce. 

Here's where I think this is a particularly sneaky and potentially novel type of scam. Any given one of us probably has dozens of subscriptions active at a given moment: Netflix, Hulu, Apple Music, Spotify, Adobe Creative Cloud, Patreon payments, Duolingo, etc... you get the idea. It's easy to lose track of what you are paying for. These companies know that they make more revenue billing paltry sums over extended time periods, and our bank accounts are experiencing death by a thousand cuts. It was actually while doing some financial hygiene and looking for subscriptions to cancel that I realized I was not actively using Nounce and should probably just cancel it, as Nounce had been billing me once a month for an entire year. 

Upon logging into Nounce, I was surprised to see that my account was classified as the *free version*, and that I could upgrade to the pro version if I wanted full functionality. Confused as to why this would be, I searched through my email to see if I had been notified about a downgrade in service. To my surprise, I realized that I actually had no email correspondence from Nounce at all, ever. No account verification, payment confirmation, anything. Yet despite this Nounce has been charging me every month, and continues to do so. 

The logical thing to do would be to reach out to customer service, right? Unfortunately this leads one to Nounce's Twitter page, which doesn't seem to be regularly updated, so no help there. However, I did notice dozens of other individuals posting that they were having the exact same problems I was (see attached screenshots). Many of these posts had been up for months, all of them without a reply from the developer. This is when I realized that this could be part of the strategy for Nounce: collect monthly payments without actually paying for AI API calls, and hope that a majority of users passively forget they are being billed, or find it too much of a hassle to cancel once they have been confusingly downgraded to the free plan and realize there is no customer support.

TLDR - The gist of the scam is this: 

1. Grow your audience on Youtube by creating content that offers something of value to people.
2. Create a web hosted platform that allows this audience to improve and practice the skills you are teaching using AI. Low work for you, potentially high payoff for subscriber.
3. Set the price for your platform at a reasonably low number ($9/month) so that you lower the barrier and maximize subscriber count.
4. Sign people up through their Google accounts, so there is no verification email process or separate account recovery.
5. Take their payment information.
6. Charge their account every month, but revert their account status to the free plan after a few months to avoid using AI resources. Hope they forget about ""just another subscription"" for ""only $9 a month.""
7. Offer no means of contact or support. 
8. Make money off of your subscribers indefinitely, until they go through the hassle of contacting their bank, which may or may not actually cancel the payments.

  
At this point my plan is to contact my bank and have them cancel any future transactions from Nounce. As this is a hassle and for many people I'd imagine they may put it off, as I did, which ultimately means more money in the pocket of the Nounce developers.  All in all I've paid Nounce around $135, which while not an enormous sum, would still be a sizeable amount of money if you consider that there are likely thousands of other people who are paying monthly but aren't getting anything in return.

I have 2 questions.

1. Does caffeine effect all people with Slow MAOA the same way? [This article](https://melissaoverman.com/maoa/) suggests coffee usually makes these people feel anxious and edgy after a drink.
2. If you have homogenous slow MAOA does it mean your parents will have exactly the same status in their MAOA too? I assume both myself and my father have the same slow MAOA but we react differently to coffee. One of us finds it pleasant and relaxing while the other does not.",1,1746387583.0,MTHFR,1,1.0,False

But you know that feeling when you just feel depressed, kinda mixed with uncertainty and not knowing what to do? I don't even know if I can call it depression but it's just that weird feeling... 

I am 21 years old and I'm currently in college about 20 miles from my hometown. I rent a house there and I come in my hometown every now and then. Last summer I spent in my hometown and did not work, I didn't get a job so I was bored most of the days to be perfectly honest. Even then I was little sick of my hometown 

Today I went out and played sports with some guys I usually played with last few years when I was in high school. They are all good guys but after speaking with them suddenly that weird feeling hit me. I now realise that I don't want to spend much time here in my hometown. 

In my college city I met a bunch of new people, made great friends which are now my best ones, it is bigger city so there is always something to do, especially in summer, we go out sometimes and get drunk, watch games live or on tv, drink coffees, eat together, study together, play bar games and just have fun in one way or another. 

This old friends I played sports with stayed the same. It's like they have not changed one bit, same mentality, same lifestyle, same everything. There is not much I can do in my hometown and there are not many people I can spend time with. Old friend group way back from elementary and middle school all went seperate ways and we don't hear from each other anymore. It just feels like there is nothing for me here and I don't see myself living here in the future. 

It's a weird feeling, my whole family is here so me not seeing myself living around them is a bit sad tbh. I love to travel although I rarely do it because of the money. I just want to travel and see world while I'm young, I want to meet new people. I need something new. There is so much to experience and I definitely can't find that in my hometown. 

My life changed in many ways since I moved to this new city for college. I am much happier now than in high school days in my hometown. I feel like coming back and spending 4 months here would mentally drain me. I just can't do it. 

Just for example, I started working out and eating more since moving to the new city, I have much bigger appetite there because my body got used to it. When I come back home I eat much less because my mind and body are used to different way of eating. Sleeping also, I go to sleep in different times when I'm in the college and when I'm back home. Just little examples of how I do things differently. All those little things are making my function in an old way, it's like I return to old regime of thinking and doing things, so I feel like spending the whole summer here is not that good for my personal growth if that makes sense.

Hey everyone.

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job and I travel a lot. I suppose it’s a good life, I don’t brag but I’ve been told that. It drives me insane because I’m always busy. I guess busy is good.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

I have a lovely little girl that will be 4 months old soon (only 6 more days!). We have not done any type of sleep training at all, but she sleeps very well through the night already. Usually from about 7:30pm to 6:30am, although she does wake up about an hour after falling asleep every single night but goes right back to sleep.. what is up with that? 

Anyway, nighttime sleep is great, and naps during the day aren’t wonderful but definitely getting better. However, I wonder if maybe I’m doing too much and need to scale back a bit. 

For reference, our routine/sleep time looks like: Bottle about 30 minutes before time to sleep, change diaper, put on Love to Dream zip up swaddle, play white noise, room dark and cool, paci & rock for 5-10 minutes. 

I’m learning very quickly this is not something we can do anywhere but at home. So if we go to visit my mom or we are out grocery shopping when nap time hits, all hell breaks loose. She is almost impossible to get to sleep unless it’s under these exact conditions.

We plan to sleep train once she’s 4 months adjusted (she was born 5 weeks early, so it’ll be closer to 5 months actual). When we begin sleep training, do we need to stop doing the white noise and keeping it so dark in the room? Do we need to make noise so she learns to sleep through noisy environments?

I really, *really* want her to learn to sleep anywhere because it’s so difficult to plan life solely around her nap schedule. I want to be able to visit my mom, go out for coffee, or go grocery shopping without feeling like a clock is ticking. Any advice or tips would be wonderful!

I'm 58F and I posted about three weeks ago that I had been caffeine free for close to two months, but I was still having trouble with binge-eating carbs and carb cravings. I got an excellent suggestion from NoSwitch3199 (thank you!!) to consider intermittent fasting and to read the book Fast, Feast, Repeat. I wanted to report that I implemented those recommendations right away. So I've been doing intermittent fasting for three weeks, and it does indeed help a lot with the eating issues. Additionally, I wanted to share that I was never able to maintain intermittent fasting UNTIL I QUIT CAFFEINE! So the two seem to go together. Fast, Feast, Repeat is a wonderful book, but for people on this subreddit, consider NOT drinking the black coffee that the author suggests. You don't need it!! A final comment I wanted to add is that I agree with all of you out there who have been saying that there's a huge difference between 60 days and 90 days caffeine free. I'm not at 90 days yet, but each day I get farther past 60 and closer to 90, I notice improvements in mood, emotional stability, thought processes, concentration, energy level, and attitude about life in general.

I'm in my late 20s, and I recently ended a friendship that had started out really meaningful but took a pretty hurtful turn. Now I’m second-guessing myself — did I overreact, or was it the right call?

This friend (I’ll call him Charles) and I met through my university’s library. We clicked quickly, and I confided in him about some heavy personal stuff — childhood trauma, family conflict, and mental health struggles, including some dark thoughts I’ve had in the past. I trusted him.

At some point, he invited me to his church group. I didn’t mind at first, but things started shifting. Political talk started creeping in — mostly pro-Trump stuff — and I made it clear I wasn’t comfortable going there. But Charles and his brother kept pushing, and it got personal. He questioned whether my values were even my own or just ""inherited from my dad"" — even after I asked him to drop it. He wouldn’t.

Eventually, I told him his behavior was upsetting and that I felt owed an apology. Instead of responding reasonably, he insisted we meet in person — but not before texting me that our friendship was “already over.” I showed up anyway, hoping we could talk it through like adults. I even bought him coffee. Instead, I got lectured. He said I had low self-esteem, accused me of dragging him down, and at one point said I was “talking like the devil.” He tried to pray over me, and I left that meeting feeling humiliated and deeply hurt. That was it — I cut him off.

Since then, I’ve distanced myself from him, his church group, and mutual connections. I expected relief, but mostly I’ve felt unsettled. Some of the mutuals have reached out, but I’ve kept it vague, just saying I’m busy.

Then I heard from someone else that Charles has been quietly telling people I “ghosted” everyone. That’s not true. I pulled back because I didn’t feel safe — emotionally or otherwise. But now I feel like he’s pushing a version of events where I’m the unstable or bitter one. Given that he knows so many personal things about me, I’m scared he’s sharing that stuff to back up his story. I feel like I’ve lost control of my own narrative, and it’s honestly been eating me alive.

Today, I saw him at the library. He was sitting two rows ahead of me with his back turned. As soon as I got up to grab a drink, he quickly moved four rows down — now facing me directly. I don’t even know what that’s about. Power play? Guilt? Paranoia on my end? All I know is it made me feel watched and exposed.

I haven't responded to the narrative he’s spreading. Part of me thinks I should say something — maybe defend myself. But part of me wonders if it’s even worth it.

So: AITA for cutting him off, and for not clearing up the “ghosting” story he’s apparently spreading?",3,1746387091.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

Right now I'm considering the Breville Barista Express (seems to be the usual pick for beginners?) and the Profitec GO (because it's beautiful and I think it would bring me joy to look at it every morning). Grateful for any guidance from this sub!

Criteria:

* General needs: 
   * I've had a Nespresso for years and have stopped using it because of the taste. Basically nothing short of a professional barista drink is satisfying to me these days.
   * I wake up early with my toddler. I'm basically brain dead when I stumble into the kitchen at 6am, so need something easy to operate.
   * On occasion, I manage to wake up first and enjoy my coffee in peace. A quiet grinder would be great so I don't wake up my kid. :)
   * I work from home and have a lot of meetings, so would ideally be able to pull a shot quickly between calls.
   * Busy, tired working parents, so easy to clean preferred!
* Location: Brooklyn, NY
* Preferred drink types: Cappuccino, cortado, espresso
* Drink frequency: \~4 per day between two adults
* Space: Limited but we can make room
* Experience level: Complete beginner
* Manual or electric: Open to either
* Candidates: Breville Barista Express (seems easy to use and I like the built-in grinder) and Profitec GO (Wirecutter recommendation, and I'm just in love with it aesthetically). But open to other recs!

1kes4vx,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBYfol0vv3s,Mark Shimkets is dying of cancer. I helped him release a special before that happens,"The short story is that Mark LOVES doing comedy and so before he leaves us, I did what I could to help him release a special. The longer story is below. Thank you for watching.   
  
\-------------  
I first met Mark Shimkets at an open mic. 



I took notice of him because Mark was funny, but more so because of his attitude. There’s a difference between a comic who is at an open mic because they think it’s what you’re supposed to do and a comic who is there to genuinely work on something. Mark was the latter.



The second time we met, we started talking a little after the show. That little turned into hours. Afterwards, I described Mark to Savannah as an enthusiastic sponge. This was a man who absorbed everything. 



When Mark decided he wanted to pursue comedy, he attended so many shows that the Pittsburgh Improv offered him a job. When Mark decided to join the Steel City Arts Foundation, he didn’t just join – he became president. When Mark decided being a fulltime comedian was his goal, he left his job and willed it into existence.



Mark immersed himself in comedy. He talked to every comedian he could. He’d go see shows on off-nights. He listened to comedy podcasts just to learn a little something more. His favorite was Ryan Sickler’s “The HoneyDew”. Mark said it was because the show was both about the technical aspects of comedy as well as comedians’ individual stories. Mark liked when being a comedian meant something to people.



After a few months of touring together, Mark asked me how he would be able to do more time. I told him he had to take it: to show me that his five-minute set is so good that I’d be forced to give him ten.



One night in New Mexico, I told Mark he was ready for longer sets. He said, “I know. I’ve been doing ten minutes the last few days. I took it.”



And that is Mark Shimkets. Someone humble enough to ask for permission, but self-aware enough to know when he doesn’t need it. Mark was also killing so hard that I didn’t even notice he was going over his time. That one is on me.



I got the call last February that Mark had cancer. Not just any cancer, but rapidly spreading stage four leukemia and lymphoma. I remember thinking how unfair it was. Mark was a sweet and wonderful person in his mid-twenties and taking all the right steps to accomplish his goals. I know cancer is never fair but this seemed particularly egregious. I couldn’t fathom a world where someone like Mark Shimkets getting cancer made sense.



It is so rare for someone in a local comedy scene to have everyone like them, and Mark wasn’t just liked, he was loved. He was as comfortable in a comedy club as he was in a coffee house as he was in a theatre. His kindness, his joy, and his love for the craft were so obvious to anyone who interacted with him. I never met or even heard of a decent person who didn’t like Mark. Friends, family, and fans routinely told me just how great he was.



Meanwhile, I told Mark that I’d hold a spot on the Europe leg for him and we’d celebrate on tour in Paris. But when Paris arrived, Mark couldn’t. He spent all of 2024 fighting. From chemo to hyperbaric chambers to whatever else was available, Mark did everything he could to stay with us. 



Mark’s hospital walls were covered with get well cards. He had visitors constantly. When he was able to be home, Mark was still a force in the comedy scene, whether it was mentoring other comedians or gathering the strength to do an occasional show. While many people would have given up long before, Mark was writing new material so he’d be ready for the next tour. Mark didn’t care if it was Paris or Pittsburgh, he just wanted to be a comedian.



In between my shows, Savannah and I visited Mark in the hospital. In between hospital stays, Mark came to our wedding. The entire time, he kept his positive attitude. Mark had an unwavering belief that if he put the time and the effort in, everything would work out. 



This past December, I got another call.



Doctors said the cancer was spreading, and that Mark had weeks to months. He was supposed open for me in Pittsburgh that weekend, our first show together since he was diagnosed. Instead, I opened for him and we filmed his set for a special. If this was going to be it, he wanted to show the world what he’d been able to accomplish in comedy in just a few short years. He wanted it all to mean something.



His family, fans, and almost every comedian in Pittsburgh came together to violate fire code and support someone that we all knew deserved it. That night, we were worried it could be the last time we saw Mark perform. Or even at all. But Mark kept fighting. 



He spent his days being poked and prodded, and his nights alternating between recovery and doing a few more shows. No matter what he went through, Mark stayed the same enthusiastic sponge he was when I first met him. Like he did in New Mexico, Mark went over his time in the best way possible. He turned “weeks to months” into half a year. But even the best sets eventually end.



Mark called me a week ago to tell me he developed an infection that the cancer treatments would exacerbate. Treating the infection would make the cancer stronger. Treating the cancer would make the infection stronger. After almost 18 months, it became clear that the fight was almost over.



I asked Mark what he wanted to do with the rest of his time. He could be as comfortable as possible at home, he could jump on a plane and join me for a few more shows, or anything in between. Instead, Mark asked for feedback. His wish before he died was to have a major booker watch his set and give him honest criticism.



“That’s your Make-a-Wish?” I asked. “You want notes?”



Mark was days to weeks away from the end and he didn’t want compliments or adoration or sympathy praise – he wanted honest feedback so he could learn more about comedy. Mark wanted his work to mean something. Not just to the people he would be forced to leave behind. But to him.



Unfortunately, he didn’t get that feedback. Despite bookers of three of the largest comedy club chains in the world all happily agreeing to see him, Mark took a turn for the worse a few days later.



Family and friends from all over the world flew in to see Mark. We wanted to spend as much time as we could absorbing kindness and love and enthusiasm from this man we were all so lucky to have in our lives. And incredibly, Mark got to tell his story on Ryan Sickler’s podcast. Mark did the interview from his hospital bed, IV connected, machines beeping in the background, and smiling the whole time. 



Mark asked me if I would put his special “Weeks to Months” on my channels. I told him how much I love him and how proud I am of him and that I was already planning on asking him permission to do so.



I want Mark’s comedy to mean something, too. I want the world to know what the people who saw him in New Mexico already did. That Mark Shimkets is someone who deserves to have more time.



We are happy for whatever time he has left with us. We hope it’s as long as possible.

I started noticing a cavity on my left bottom wisdom tooth around tray 2 and found a black spot on the tooth right next to the wisdom tooth. I’m not sure if it’s a cavity or a discoloration as it wasn’t there a night before and  I had black coffee right before I noticed it. 

I do whatever is possible to ensure I don’t get cavities. I use an ultrasonic cleaner to clean my trays, brush floss and mouthwash before putting my trays on after a meal and never eat or drink with the trays in. At this point I’m genuinely clueless why I’m developing cavities. I don’t have a history of cavities prior to Invisalign. I recently adopted Dr. Ellie Philips’ total mouth care system and am hoping this will help.

1kes182,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kes182/reveal_the_ultimate_nespresso_citiz_espresso/,Reveal the ultimate Nespresso CitiZ Espresso Machine review for coffee lovers!,"The **Nespresso EN167CCA CitiZ Espresso Machine by De’Longhi, Chrome** had me hooked from the moment I unpacked it. I’ve been using it daily for about three months now, and it’s safe to say I have thoroughly tested this sleek piece of brewing technology. Everything from its design features to the coffee quality was judged meticulously during this time. This review will cover all aspects of this espresso machine—where it shines and where it stumbles a bit. 

**Sleek Design and Build**  
The modern chrome finish on this espresso machine fits effortlessly into my kitchen's aesthetic. Its compact size (measuring 5.75""D x 2.01""W x 4.29""H) works wonders in saving me counter space—something I really value. Despite its smaller footprint, it feels solidly constructed at 8.92 pounds, and the chrome gives it a premium vibe. Both minimalists and coffee aficionados will appreciate this design. Setting it up in my limited counter space was effortless, but it still manages to catch some envious glances during family brunches.

**Usability and Interface**  
This machine’s manual operation is refreshingly simple. You don’t have to wrestle with confusing buttons or intricate interfaces. Two intuitive buttons control the espresso (40 mL) and lungo (110 mL) options. I’ve even reprogrammed these for custom volumes when friends with unique tastes come over. The automatic shutoff feature after nine minutes has saved me multiple times from worrying whether I left it on before heading out. A programmable option of up to 30 minutes is available but nine minutes works perfectly for me. Something that stood out is how quickly it heats up—about 25 seconds, which is immensely helpful during rushed mornings.  

[Check Nespresso EN167CCA price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b01n7lcsfj/)

**Espresso Quality**  
The coffee brewed by this machine is remarkable. As someone who transitioned from another brand’s drip coffee maker, the improvement was night and day. This machine operates with a 19-bar pressure system that extracts flavors beautifully, resulting in rich espresso with that creamy crema layer on top—my absolute favorite part. Whether I’m brewing a quick double shot or indulging in a lungo, the taste is consistently top-notch. My husband, who usually prefers his coffee black, swears it tastes much closer to a professional café experience.  

**Compatibility and Versatility**  
The CitiZ model uses Nespresso original pods. I was thrilled when the machine came with a starter pack of 14 pods, making it easy to explore the variety of flavor profiles offered. Additionally, it dispenses hot water when no pod is inserted. Using this, I’ve made everything from tea to instant soups when I wasn’t in the mood for coffee. That little versatility goes a long way in keeping it from becoming a one-trick pony. Folding the drip tray to accommodate my larger mugs was a thoughtful feature, and it reduces messes significantly compared to other machines I’ve tried.

**Highlights**:  
- Compact and chic chrome design perfect for modern kitchens.  
- Rapid heating within 25 seconds.  
- 19-bar pressure ensures barista-grade espresso.  
- Compatible with original Nespresso pods and offers hot water dispensing.  
- Customizable shot volumes and automatic shutoff enhance its functionality.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Like many other single-cup machines, it’s a bit noisy. Not ideal if someone else is sleeping nearby when you’re making coffee.  
- While the milk frother is mentioned as a feature, it’s not included with this unit. That felt misleading until I double-checked the details. You’d need to purchase one separately for that café-like frothy goodness.  
- I noticed a faint hissing sound when the machine remains plugged in over longer periods. While unplugging it after use has become a habit, it’s still a minor inconvenience.

**Competing Products**  
Other espresso machines like the Breville Bambino Plus and Keurig K-Cafe immediately sprang to mind when I started comparing options. The Bambino Plus boasts impressive heating speeds (three seconds!) and includes a steam wand for frothing milk directly, but it’s significantly bulkier than the CitiZ and costs more upfront. The Keurig K-Cafe, on the other hand, has broader pod compatibility, including non-espresso drinks, but its pressure system doesn’t match the flavor extraction you’d expect from a specialized espresso machine like this one. For straight-up espresso aficionados, the CitiZ easily holds its ground due to its taste and build.

**Cost Efficiency**  
When I considered the features and functionality it offers, it outweighs several options in its price category. The only factor adding to monthly expenses is the price of Nespresso pods. They’re slightly higher compared to generic coffee pods available for other machines. However, it’s a small price to pay for espresso quality that rivals what you’d find in premium coffeehouses. I’ve gifted one of these machines to my coffee-loving aunt, and she’s already raving about how much money she’s saving by cutting out her daily coffee shop runs.

Saturdays I usually have a quiet, relaxing morning - breakfast, coffee, workout. Great start. Then I'll sit down and make a list of things I ""want"" to do and ""should"" do. Then I start to feel overwhelmed. There are the daily/weekly tasks that eat up a lot of time, then there are the bigger tasks that I've scheduled, but I just ignore reminders or snooze them for the next week.

I think Cal would recommend scheduling and batching the regular tasks: every Saturday morning take out the trash, recycling, compost; every Sunday do some other task. But even with that, I either get to Sunday evening exhausted, but having done most of the tasks. Or, I've spent the weekend doing things I enjoyed (good), but left a lot of chores undone (bad).

Part of the challenge is that my partner does not have a regular work schedule, whereas I have a typical 9-to-5. When she has a lighter work week, she'll do a lot of chores too, but during busy weeks those things pile up and I have a hard time managing them.

so I (18F) recently met a 22M (I’ll call him Daniel) on Instagram. He’s a uni student, and his family owns a jewelry store. After talking for two days, we decided to meet for coffee at a mall near my house. He lives on the east side of the city, and I’m on the west side (almost a 2-hour public transit trip), so I appreciated him making the effort to come. From the moment we met, things felt off. I was anxious (I hadn’t told my family, so I was feeling guilty), and when I told him not to touch me, he hugged me anyway. At Starbucks, I wanted to pay for myself, but he insisted. He sat right next to me when I asked him to sit across, started touching me, and called me his “girlfriend,” even though I hadn’t agreed to that. When I told him I was uncomfortable, he ignored me. He touched my face, said weird stuff like he wanted to kiss every part of my body, and started talking about marriage, where we’d honeymoon, and what we’d name our kids. Then he got jealous of my best friend (a gay guy named Ethan) and said things like he could easily overpower him. He even asked, “Ethan or me?” and wouldn’t let go of my hand. At one point, he said he was going to kiss me. I kept saying “no,” and he grabbed my face to try to turn it toward him. I resisted, so he only managed to kiss my cheek. He then said he wished we had gone somewhere more private, and he laughed, saying we’d do that on our next date. Luckily, my cousin Emma (who I brought along as backup) called me to the food court. We sat where she could see us. I again told him to sit across from me, but he kept trying to sit next to me and touch me. He said I owed him a kiss because he “came all that way,” and when I said I didn’t want to, he said, “That’s just how I am.” Things got stranger when he said I’d have to give him my Instagram password, stop talking to Ethan, and take his last name when we got married. I told him I wanted to keep my last name and give it to my future kids. He laughed in my face and said no man would ever accept that because “a woman belongs to the man” after marriage. He called himself “a caveman” on these matters. He mocked my last name and pulled away when I kept pushing back. I suggested combining our surnames, but he refused and repeated the same sexist stuff.
Eventually, Emma and her boyfriend came over and said we had to leave. On the way out, I kept arguing with him about the surname thing. At the door, he said, “So that’s it? You’re letting a clean, good guy like me go over a stupid issue like this? If you think any man would accept that, you’re naive,” and then walked away. I blocked him everywhere. Now, I feel guilty. He came a long way, paid for coffee, and technically didn’t do anything extreme — but he completely ignored my boundaries, made me feel unsafe, and pressured me to do things I said no to.",6,1746386310.0,AITAH,28,0.88,False

Last Tuesday, I had the *biggest* presentation of my life. Like, “if-you-nail-this-you-get-promoted” kind of big. I was dressed nice, had my slides ready, even brushed my teeth *midday*—that’s how serious it was.

Five minutes before the meeting, I hear Milo whining by the back door. He *never* does that unless he really needs to go. I figured I had time, so I ran out with him.

Big mistake.

The little goblin ran to the middle of the yard, made direct eye contact, and just… laid down. Sunbathing. No pee. No poop. Just vibes. He’d tricked me.

I’m out there in dress clothes, trying to coax a 70-pound loaf of bread back inside while my phone is buzzing in my pocket. Meeting time. Panic time.

I finally scoop him up (he thinks it’s a game), run inside, toss him a treat, and jump into the Zoom call one minute late, flustered, sweaty, and unmuted.

That’s when it happened.

One of the VPs goes:  
“Wait… who’s that?!”  
And I’m like, “Oh sorry, that’s just my dog in the background.”

Milo, being Milo, has taken my *actual seat* and is sitting perfectly still in front of the webcam, just looking regal as hell. Tongue out. Perfect lighting. A golden *angel*.

Everyone laughs. Like, really laughs. The ice is broken. I smoothly transition into my presentation, and by the end, the VP literally says, “Great work—and tell your assistant Milo he nailed it.”

Reader, I got the promotion.

Moral of the story: Milo knew I was nervous. He stole my chair on *purpose* so I’d loosen up, get a laugh, and crush it.

Or maybe he’s just a brat.

1kertzt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kertzt,Newborn collector story,"TLDR; Just found out about the ps1 era gone retro and started collecting/reselling. Finally dug up a CIB Diablo from my parents house. 

So about two weeks ago I was visiting my parents house and don’t ask me why but this time I felt nostalgic so I went to my place where I used to play PlayStation with my friends as a kid while living at home (33 years today). I started rummaging around my games and started to look up the used market prices and asking ChatGPT. I got blown away by the fact that I had Tombi! 2 in my hand worth over $100-150 here in Sweden. So while this wasn’t my favorite game as a kid or nostalgia I managed to sell it for $100 because it was missing the manual. 

Later I found out that Diablo PAL version was worth even more, and if not WAY more nostalgic value to me. But I just couldn’t find it. I raided the house and the garage and I just knew I had it somewhere. But I had to give up my search and felt defeated. It was probably only a scratchy disc at best in a case stowed away somewhere I’d never find it. But I couldn’t release the thought that I might possess something valuable. 

So today I was my parents celebrating a birthday and I thought ”hey just one more search” and started rummaging after the coffee while everyone was at the table. My mom asked me what I was looking for and I told her. Then she turns to my dad and says ”Oh don’t you remember that friend of yours? She came here like 10 years ago asking if you had some game for her kids and I remember you gave her some!” My heat sank.. Diablo, metal gear solid, final fantasy VIi all gone for nothing to some random kid just because my parents thought i thought it was obsolete worthless junk?!

I felt sick to my stomach and before leaving I said to my brother ”you help me look in case I missed something!” So we go to the games room and find nothing then he suggests the garage that I thought I thoroughly had scoured the last time. But fine. He starts finding stuff that’s nostalgic for him and I go round him to the inner shelf of the garage and see some cd cases stacked on eachother next to a box from an angle I hadn’t looked before. 

As I go closer I narrow my eyes, can it be?! Yes it says Diablo! Before I come close enough to inspect it I think to myself ”it’s probably just the broken empty case, I can’t even remember I had the manual…”. But when I pick it up, it’s actually freaking CIB!! And in okay shape for laying in a broken case in the garage for over 15 years! It felt like I hit the lottery! 

When I got home I found a better case and cleaned everything surgically without damaging anything and put it in a sealed box. I just love that game, it’s so sexy to look at and packed with nostalgic memories from me and my friends at the age of 12 staying up all night advancing down towards Diablo in this Swedish dubbed game. 

That’s my story for today!

Justin stepped back outside onto his porch holding his wife’s checkbook in his hands.   He was signing the check but hadn’t filled in the amount yet.  “Hey, man.  Would five thousand get you up and running?”

Looking up, Eric wasn’t in the rocking chair.  That confused him.  “Eric?”

Trudy stepped out next with a fresh cup of coffee.  “Here ya go.”  Except, she too looked out on the empty porch that only held a few rocking chairs and Marvin’s firetruck.

They both then scanned the yard in a panic.  They also both dropped what was in their hands when they didn’t see Eric’s car in the driveway.

“MARVIN!” they yelled in unison.

An hour later, the cops were there and taking statements, getting a picture of Marvin, descriptions of both Eric and his car, as well as all the other information they could.  Trudy was bawling in the living room with Jack, Markel, and Miriam crying almost as loudly.  Justin was doing his best to hold it together.  He was also wondering how his friend could betray him like that.  To kidnap his son was beyond illogical, but Eric had done it.  He said as much to the detectives.

“Sir.  We’ve sent out an Amber alert.  We’ll get him.” Said a stern looking Detective named Andrew Jordan.

Justin just nodded in defeat.  He wanted to go get his gun and track Eric down, but after learning that his former friend had been in a lot more trouble than he could’ve known, it didn’t seem likely.

“Are you sure you didn’t know that he was laundering money through that construction company or that he’d been caught embezzling from a local gang recently?”

Justin didn’t like that and eyed the detective hard at the implied accusation.  “Sir, I haven’t been with that company for three years now.  If you’re looking at my place and thinkin’ that, then I can assure you, this’s all my wife’s doing for gettin’ a better job.  Not me doin’ shady shit.  My son was taken.  Focus on that.”

The detective held up his hands in surrender.  He was a young handsome white man in his thirties.  Brown hair and eyes wearing a cheap suit.  He at least seemed on the up and up to Justin.  Especially when he said sincerely, “I apologize.  I didn’t mean for you to think I was saying you had any knowledge of this or his motive.  Look, we’ve gotten all we can right now. Take care of your family and I’ll give you a call as soon as we get any leads.  I’m sure the alert will turn up something since it’s so early.  He couldn’t have gotten too far.”

Justin could only nod numbly at that.  He felt like a failure because he failed to keep his youngest boy from being snatched.  

When the police finally left, his family were still completely in anguished shock at what’d happened.  Justin could only join them and hold them tight.  It was then that his own tears joined theirs and he cried for a long while with his family at their loss.

\--- 



Trudy Harris had called in a PTO day to Jake.  He could tell something had happened, but she didn’t want to give him the details.  Only that it was a family emergency.  She was too raw to try and explain it to him. She knew if she even tried, she wouldn’t get four words out of her mouth before they turned to sobs again.  

The police detective had called about noon but had no leads yet.  Eric’s car had been found abandoned on a rural road only twenty minutes from their home.  It’d been a damned rental, so they had no clue what he was in.  It also confirmed that Eric had planned the kidnapping instead of taking a random opportunity.  Justin and Trudy knew what that meant.  Eric was gonna do something very very bad with their boy.  And they were helpless to stop it.

That whole day, the Harris family waited by the phone for anything.  They cried or talked about Marvin and how much sunshine he brought to their lives.  They were trying anything to keep their hope alive.

At around eight in the evening, they all had the same thoughts.  Go to bed and hope that tomorrow would be better and their Marvin would come home again.

Miriam knew the time had come.  Her mom was sitting alone in the kitchen, just staring at Marvin’s favorite plastic superhero squad cup and trying her best not to break again.  

“Momma?”

Trudy slowly turned to Miriam.  “Yeah, baby?” she asked softly, without much life in her normally robust voice.

Miriam was dressed in her pink nightgown and slowly hugged her mom from behind.  Her mom’s ice cream cone patterned soft fuzzy robe felt wonderful, even on this terrible day.

“Momma, I’ve gotta tell you something.”

Her mom nodded.   “Go ahead,” she said in whispered sadness.

“Go to the ranch tomorrow.  Tell Kathy what happened.  You need to tell her.  Then after, uhm…”

“I can’t go there.  I need to be here for Marvin.”

“Momma, you have to go there tomorrow, or Marvin will never come home.”

Trudy shifted quickly in the chair to look up at Miriam’s wet eyes.  “What do you mean by that?”

“I mean, you have to go to the Ranch tomorrow and tell her about Marvin.  Please.  If not, the Devil won’t find you.”

Trudy stood up immediately and grabbed her shoulders hard.  “Who the hell are you talkin’ about?!”

Miriam reached up and gently held her mom’s face.  “I dreamed again, Momma.  I saw this.  I must make you go tell Kathy about Marvin.  You have to or Marvin won’t come home.  Please.  Please believe me and bring Marvin home.”

Trudy didn’t know how to process this, but her daughter was giving her hope.  “You mean it?!  You mean it?!”

“Yeah, Momma.  Just head there and he’ll come home.  I promise.”

Trudy hugged Miriam fiercely.  “I’ll do it, baby.  I’ll talk to the Devil.”

What Miriam didn’t know was that Trudy had a feeling she knew who that was.  The quietest man she’d ever met.  A man who would roam the ranch sometimes and creep everyone out.  She’d met his wife and had gotten some respect out of her last month.  The rumors about that woman weren’t exactly true.  After Trudy got her respect, they’d had a few pleasant conversations since then.  But the husband had been a different story.  But, for her son, she’d bargain with the Devil himself if she had to.

After tapping the door chime’s button, Jessica hefted Cassidy in her arms.  He hadn’t been a big boy when he’d been born, but he’d quickly gained some good weight over the last two months.  She smiled at Cassidy’s sweet face that was poking out of the white blanket with little kittens all over it.  She turned that smile up to Seth who’d readjusted the large bag of baby necessities he was carrying.  He also held an apple pie Jessica had baked that morning.  

It was a glorious sunny day today.  The perfect day to visit friends.  Dressed in happy clothing, perfect for such a spring day as this, Jessica was looking forward to telling Kathy all about her adventures in motherhood.  She’d just come from the Hiwalkers and had an amazing visit.  She and Allessandra had both babbled A LOT to each other about their babies, comparing notes.  That talk had amused the shit out of Jed, Inanna, and Laesha.  Alley’s twins were beautiful and had cooed at Cassidy while he did the same, smiling rainbows right back at them.  Now, he was napping while they waited for Kathy to come to the door.

When it opened, Jessica’s happy greeting died on her lips.  Kathy had clearly been ugly crying.  Seth had noticed it too.   After setting the baby bag down, he reached out to hold Kathy’s arm.

“Kathy?  What happened?” Seth asked soft with a lot of worry in his tone.

She shook her head then waved them in.  On their way to sit down in her receiving room, she blew her nose several times.  When they sat on one of the big couches, Kathy dropped the bomb.

“Trudy Harris’s littlest boy was kidnapped Sunday night.  She just came by and told me.”

“What?!”  Jessica asked in shocked sadness.

Kathy nodded, almost about to cry again.  Her own boy of three was upstairs napping and she couldn’t imagine what she’d do in Trudy’s place.

“A friend of her husband, Justin, had come to town for a visit.  Told them he needed some help.  They turned their backs for a few minutes, and… Marvin was gone.”

Jessica’s eyes leaked tears in heartache for Trudy.  She liked that woman a lot.  Especially after they got a good understanding of each other recently.  Trudy was a lot like Jessica’s own mom and that had been a big revelation to her.  But for this to happen to Trudy, was truly awful.

“Do they have any leads or anything?” Jessica asked quietly.

Kathy just shrugged.   “As far as I know, they don’t.  I don’t even know where to begin to look with what contacts I have.  My people just aren’t geared to look for missing children.”

The air seemed to shift in that room when a soft voice spoke up then.  “Mine are.  Where’s Trudy now?”

Kathy shifted her gaze over to Seth and she saw not sadness, but a deep burning rage in his face.  It was then that Freyja and Kathy sensed the true measure of who sat across from them.  Both approved of him greatly at that moment.  Kathy said low, “She just left.  She’s heading home.”

Seth turned and kissed Jessica on the cheek.  Jessica looked at him questioningly.  To her, he said, “I’m gonna go.  If I’m too long, see if you can spend the night here or at the Hiwalkers. I’m going to go do something about this.”

Before either could say anything, Seth stood up, pooled darkness beneath his feet, then was gone.  Quick and silent.  

Kathy and Jessica looked at each other for a few blinks. Jessica then smiled a little while adjusting her baby boy in her lap.  Softly she cooed to Cassidy, “I think somebody is in really deep shit right now.  Aren’t they li’l Cassidy?”

Kathy wiped her eyes a little more, then she answered for the baby with a firm, “They deserve it.”

\--- 



The pure raw and loud emotion of desolation was easy for Seth to find in the dark.  Trudy hadn’t gotten far by the time Seth caught up to where she was.  When he emerged from his shadowpath, he saw Trudy completely breaking again while sitting in her truck on the dirt road leading out of Jake’s ranch.  No one was around the two of them but some grazing cattle in the distance.

She looked up at him and Seth saw her grief plain upon her face.  She couldn’t stop crying and that only made Seth angrier.  A child had been taken by someone who didn’t have their best interests at heart.  That was unacceptable.  Thankfully, it was something that was rectifiable.

Seth slowly approached the truck where he and Trudy had locked gazes and didn’t avert them from each other.  Even when Seth opened the door, she was still staring at him, not having stopped her sobs.

Seth reached slowly over and took her hand.  She gripped his so firm, it was as if she put every ounce of her strength in it.  Her voice was lost in her grief, but her heart showed her hope in the grip of her hand.

“Marvin will be in your arms by tomorrow.  God can’t bring him to you.  But the devil will.”

Trudy could only nod.  She was too distraught to do anything else.   Seth accepted it.  He slowly left her truck, not turning around but instead fell into darkness, to disappear just as suddenly as he came.  Trudy’s daughter had been right.  She hoped with all that she was, that that meant Marvin would come home.  It took her a few more minutes to calm down.  Soon she began to hum an old gospel song to herself while she drove home.  Her tears had stopped for the time being, but her prayers had only just begun.  Except, Seth had been right too.  God wasn’t going to bring her boy back.  That blonde devil was.

After arriving home, Trudy began to cook.  She wanted to make sure that her boy had his favorite meal and stuff ready to eat when he came home.   

“Baby?  What’re you doing?”

Trudy turned to see her beautiful man, worried sick just like she was, standing in the doorway of the kitchen looking as haggard as his voice.

To him, she said lovingly, “I’m fixin’ Marvin’s favorite.  I wanna have it ready at a moment’s notice when he comes home.”

“Baby, don’t…”

Trudy shook her head at him.  “I will and… go get a shower and shave.  When I finish, we’re gonna sit down together as a family tonight and… be a family.  We need this.”

Justin smiled at her a little.  His first one since Eric took their boy.  “Okay.  We’ll be ready when he comes home.”

“That’s right.  Yes, we will,” Trudy said emphatically before turning back to the stove and popping in some more bell peppers into the scratch made spaghetti sauce she was working on.

\---- 



Trudy had prayed.  She had prayed hard several times that night while she and Justin tried their best to get any rest in their bed.  Jack, Markel, and Miriam weren’t in much better shape.  None of them had much sleep that night.  They’d gotten up the next morning early but there was no joy because their little ball of sunshine still wasn‘t home.  

None of them had even been on any social media since the kidnapping, not wanting to get any false hopes up or risk letting Eric find out anything by accident.  Miriam had stopped her brothers from doing that and they readily agreed to it.  Currently, most of them were in the den watching TV together in silence, but not really.  They were really just waiting for their dad’s cell phone to ring with any good news.

Trudy couldn’t do that.  Instead, she was quietly sobbing again while rocking on the front porch.  Marvin’s favorite firetruck was parked right beside her waiting for him to return too.  Then it happened.  Miriam’s dream came true.

The door to Justin’s little shed on the other side of the yard opened some and a head poked out of the door.  Marvin’s head.

Trudy yelled, “MARVIN!”

Marvin saw her and began to run as fast as his little body could go.  “MOMMA!” he screamed.

Holding her arms open at the top of the steps, her littlest boy practically jumped right into them for the biggest welcome home hug he would ever experience.  Trudy babbled a lot while they stayed there.  Until Justin came rushing out of the door and found them.  He screamed too and got his big hug in while Trudy yelled into the house.

The reunion lasted for most of an hour before they calmed down and began to talk.  Justin called the police who were on the way soon after.

While at the table with a big plate of homemade spaghetti, Trudy asked her boy, “What happened?  Can you tell us what happened?”

Marvin was smiling brightly even with a big mouthful of food in.  Soon he swallowed and said, “Yeah!  Uncle Seth came and got me!”

The room went quiet.  Trudy smiled at Miriam who smiled right back at her. The others were confused.

“Who’s Uncle Seth?” asked Jack. “We don’ know no one named Seth.”

Markel’s eyes went wide as platters, “Yeah, we do!  That creepy white guy on the ranch we saw a few weeks ago, boy!  He was just starin’ at us while we waited for mom, remember?!”

Jack sat back in his chair, looking at his mom.   Him and Markel were dressed in basketball shorts and shirts, enough so that they almost looked exactly alike.  Funnily enough, they were almost twins in how they completed each other’s thoughts even though they were a little more than a year apart in age.  “The long-eared dude!  I remember him.  Marvin, you sure?”

Marvin turned to him and said, “Yeah!  It was him.  The shadow man took Eric into a wall and then Uncle Seth came out and untied me.  He’s really awesome.  Much better than Eric.”

Justin asked quietly, “Where did Eric go?”

Marvin shrugged.  “The Shadowman took him.  Uncle Seth said he was never going to return.  I believe him.”

The five of them stared at one another for a while before Trudy asked, “Baby, do you know anything more like why Eric took you?”

Marvin drank some milk to wash the meatball down that he just finished.  “He called someone.  Said he needed a bunch of money and a ticket.  I think he was gonna sell me for a… uhm… experiment or something.   I hate Eric, Dad.   He’s not a good friend.  Uncle Seth didn’t like him either.”

Justin smiled at his boy.  “Yeah.  I don’t like Eric either.  I think he got what was comin’ to him.”

Trudy sat back and started to think really hard about this turn of events.  She thought really hard about the silent man who roamed the ranch sometimes.  She then made up her mind.  Turning to her husband, she said firmly, “No one speaks of this.  And I mean it.  When the cops get here, Marvin is gonna say that he escaped somehow and ran home.  That’s it. None about Uncle Seth.  Period. We just got our miracle, and we can’t let the cops go question Seth about this.  I just know bad things would happen if they did.  So, we aren’t saying jack about it.  Hear?!”

Justin was kinda shocked about that.  He turned when he heard a couple of cars crunching gravel in the driveway.  Turning back to his family, he nodded to them.  “She’s right.  Marvin. When they ask you what happened, whattya gonna tell them?”

Marvin sat back and rubbed his pocket where the little stone that his Uncle Seth had given him was.  It was his secret.  He was a big boy and could keep a secret.  This had to be what his dad was talking about.  Marvin said quietly, “I’m gonna tell them that I was in a hotel room, but he didn’t tie me down good enough.  I got out and ran for it when he was in the bathroom.”

“And how did you get here?” Miriam asked.

Jack said firmly, “Marvin, you tell ‘em that you saw Old Man Gordon’s truck at the motel.  He goes there every Tuesday for ladylove stuff.  You got in the back and hid in his tool chest because you knew Eric would come lookin’ and Gordon lives just down the way from your house.”

Marvin smiled extremely brightly at that.  “I can do that!  He’s got that rusty green truck with the Punisher logo on the gas lid!”

Markel scrubbed his head.  “That’s right!  That’s how we do this!”

Trudy hated liars, but today, she was pretty proud of her boys.  The knocks and then the door chime sounding its alert came next.  Justin got up to go let them in.  The detective and two uniformed officers swept into the room and indeed seemed pretty surprised at seeing Marvin sitting there shoveling another big bite of spaghetti in his mouth.

Marvin did his duty relaying the events as he was told to protect his new uncle.  No one mentioned anything about what happened to Eric either.  From that moment on, they didn’t care.  He was gone and that was it.  All the Harris family needed was what happened after the police had come, gotten their statements, and left.  They got to sit on their big couch in their living room together and let Marvin fall asleep on his momma while they watched an Avenger movie.

\--- 



The next day, Trudy came bustling down to the ranch and over to Kathy’s house early in the morning.  She had some business to attend to.  She had someone to find and thank.  She was gonna thank the Devil himself.

When her truck stopped at Kathy’s house, she had to calm herself down again.  Kathy’s big Suburban was there, but Jake had already left for the day.  Trudy would catch up to him that afternoon to get back to work as well as fill him in on what happened.  But right now, she got out quickly to make a beeline up to Kathy’s huge home to find out how she could get in touch with Seth Al’Thaoal.  In her hands, she held her finest triple chocolate cake with the fanciest icing she could craft.  The devil was gonna not only get her gratitude, but a reward as well that had ‘Thank You, Uncle Seth’ written in icing.

After knocking, Trudy waited only about two minutes before that door opened and Kathy Donovan greeted her with a big hug and a smile.  Trudy saw it plain.  She knew.

“Hey Trudy!” Kathy exclaimed.

“Kathy.” Trudy said calmly.

Kathy’s smile didn’t waver.  She just stepped aside to let Trudy in.  When she did so, Trudy looked to her right and there sitting with a happy baby boy was Seth, playing with the baby’s nose and fingers, eliciting a lot of happy gurgle laughs from him.  Seeing that truly warmed Trudy’s soul.  From behind Kathy came Jessica who was wearing what had to be one of Kathy’s bathrobes and holding two cups of coffee in mismatched earthen mugs.

“Hi Trudy!” Jessica said happily.

Trudy was starting to lose her composure.  But she smiled at them all.  “Hello, Jessica.  Hi Seth.”

Seth waved, then picked up Cassidy to face her and helped him wave a chubby little arm at her too.  That little boy smiled really big when that happened.  

Kathy took her mug of coffee from Jessica as well as put her hand on Jessica.  “Let’s give them a moment, Jess.”  

Jessica nodded before coming in for a quick hug from Trudy then heading over to take up her happy baby again.  Kathy and Jessica then left the two of them alone, heading back down the hallway and up the steps to Kathy’s private rooms.

Trudy calmly walked over to the man she’d actually never spoken to before.  She saw his small smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes.  Trudy didn’t understand it but that wasn’t going to stop her.  She held up the cake and opened up the box to show him what it said.

“Seth, I made this last night and helped Marvin decorate it.  I hope you like it.”

Seth looked down at it and nodded.  “It smells delicious.  You didn’t have to do that, you know.”

Trudy smiled at him then set the cake down on the little coffee table that they stood next to. She then came to him and hugged him fiercely without hesitation.  She felt him slowly wrap his arms around her to return the hug.  She said with as much warmth as she could muster, “Yes, I did.  You saved your nephew and I ain’t ever gonna forget it.  You’re welcome to my home anytime you want.  I’m gonna make sure you know everything that happens in Marvin’s life because of you.  You’re his Uncle Seth and he hasn’t done nothing but talk about you since he came home.”

Trudy felt Seth squeeze her tighter for that.  “You mean it?  You’re okay with me being an… I guess… uhm… adopted Uncle?”

Trudy pulled back but didn’t let him go.  He was being shy and his huge green eyes were lightly glowing now which didn’t scare her in the least.  She knew it then like she knew the sky was blue, he’d accepted her. She’d touched the devil’s heart, and it felt amazing to do so.  God’s ways were indeed mysterious, so this has to be something indeed subtle by him because becoming the friend of the Devil had to be the greatest of triumphs.  Not understanding why, she did it anyway.  She reached out to hold the back of his head and pulled him so she could kiss his forehead.  Then she said warmly, “Yes, I do.  You were sent to me for a reason, and it doesn’t matter to me why.  I’m gonna accept it as the gift that it was.”

Seth then giggled softly at her.  “It was my pleasure.”

Trudy then stepped back and asked more seriously.  “What happened to Eric?”

Seth’s demeanor hardened in an instant.  With a harsh whisper, he said, “I put him in hell.”

Trudy nodded once.  She believed in divine punishment, after all.  “Good.”

“Good?”

“Yep, and I don’t need to know any more about him.  Now, my favorite blondie boy, let’s get to know each other better.  I just don’t like how you roam all around my ranch and no one gives you the time of day!  So, you best be lettin’ me know when you and your wife visit so I can make sure ya’ll are taken care of properly.  And no back talk about it either.  You hear?”

Seth’s eyes changed once again, Trudy noted.  They warmed to her and she liked those happy devilish eyes a lot when they did.  She’d touched the devil’s heart in the simplest way possible.  She basically told him she was his friend.  His girly giggle was amusing too.  “Favorite blondie boy?”

“That’s right!  Now, come on!  I gotta hold that baby of yours!  Then we gonna talk about having you and Jessica over for dinner sometime soon!  Marvin wants to show his new uncle all of his stuff!” Trudy said very enthusiastically.

“We can do that.  Besides, it’ll give me some practice with that little glutton upstairs.  By the way, when should I start reading to him?  Got any good advice for me?”

Trudy blew up in joy at that.  She snagged Seth’s arm to start marching him up towards the second floor.  “OH HONEYCHILD!!  Have I got some good advice for you!  Start now!  And here’s another thing you can do that’s good….”

Standing out in the woods near Katherine Von Swordsaint’s home where he could hear the loud banter from an open window, Anansi wiped some sweat from his brow.  He’d been alerted when a small pop of power appeared near where his daughter’s friends lived which had gotten him curious as to what it could be.  So, he’d cut a bargain short with some fool named Tomlinson who was trying to get his tech company on the right track and into billion-dollar status.  Too bad Mr. Tomlinson didn’t read the fine print that Anansi put in casually that said if he stole any tech, his company would go down in flames.  If Mr. Tomlinson was willing to bargain with a shady person, he was also unlikely to keep his word as Anansi saw it.  Oh well.  

Currently though, Anansi was actually pretty amused by this unknown power in the world.  He was a shrewd one, Anansi had to give him credit.  This had him grinning again in admiration at Seth’s ability to turn just about any interaction into an opportunity of some measure later down the timeline.  Anansi hadn’t suggested it.  He was damned sure Tootles hadn’t suggested it.  But Seth giving that little boy a wishstone had to be one helluva fate/game changer that would likely produce something damned entertaining for sure one day.  Anansi put his fedora back in its place before closing his eyes and taking in the merry sounds of laughter from the house one more time.  Soon, he chuckled softly at how the devourer of reality could actually play with reality itself in the most subtle ways, before he webbed his body and dusted away.",1,1746385691.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Whether it’s working from a cafe, going for a run, traveling, or just zoning out at home, I’ve realized that no single pair is perfect for every situation. That said, if you’re looking for a top-tier pair in the $150–$250 range and you're using Android, I’d definitely recommend checking out the Sony WF-1000XM5 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II.

The Sony WF-1000XM5 is kind of my go-to for travel or when I want to really immerse myself. I used them on a flight recently, and the noise canceling was so good it actually felt like I was in a quiet room—not surrounded by a hundred other passengers. The sound is rich and super customizable through the Sony app, and I love how the Adaptive Sound Control adjusts based on where I am—like switching from quiet mode at a café to ambient mode when I’m walking outside. It’s a smart touch that makes a difference when you're constantly changing environments.

The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II, on the other hand, are my “I need silence now” earbuds. I pull them out when I’m trying to focus in a noisy space—like a busy coffee shop or even at home when someone’s watching TV in the next room. The fit is insanely comfortable, and the noise canceling is the best I’ve experienced, hands down. They also sound fantastic, especially with podcasts and acoustic music—very clear and natural.

Then there are the Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, which I tend to use for everyday stuff, especially when I’m pairing them with my phone or tablet. I love how smoothly they switch between devices, and they’re great for quick calls or workouts. The fit is snug but not too tight, and I don’t worry about sweat or rain since they’re water-resistant. If you’re using a Samsung device, they really shine thanks to the extra features like 360 Audio and high-res support.

Each of these earbuds brings something different to the table, depending on the vibe and what I need in the moment.

\---3 years after the events of Humanity’s Awakening (The Obelisk Arc – Complete Story).  Earth.  A rural area outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.  A small brick house owned by Justin and Trudy Harris thirty minutes from \[Redacted\] Ranch ---

Miriam Harris woke up in a cold sweat.  She’d nearly screamed her fear out which would’ve probably had her mom and dad come running to find out what was wrong.  However, she couldn’t tell them any of what was actually wrong, so she kept quiet with her hands over her mouth.  Instead, after waking up fully, she sat up in her bed shaking because what she had in her head was no nightmare.  What she’d seen while she slept wasn’t a dream of any kind.  It was a truth that she had to make come true because it’d been vivid clear and it was now running circles in her head.  But the problem was, it made no sense.  Her mom wasn’t sad.  Mom’s new job at the Donovan horse training ranch didn’t have a devil walking its roads.  Everyone was safe and sound in their beds, including her little brother, Marvin.

Getting out of bed to head to the bathroom to get a towel to wipe off the sweat and freshen up didn’t make her feel better.  Instead, she sat on the side of the tub to think.  Ever since she’d had that first nightmare of a woman with red eyes kissing her forehead and whispering to her to Awaken, she’d had these little episodes occasionally.  In every case, Miriam had to step in, in some way, to make them come true.  

So far, they’d all been minor little things.  Like knowing where to look for a fifty-dollar bill that some guy had dropped and had blown away.  She knew exactly where the wind had carried it in the nearby woods of the local shopping center.  That little bit of money had been a big help because her dad and mom were just now climbing out of debt thanks to her mom’s new job that paid really well.  But months ago, they couldn’t afford what her brother had needed.  Miriam helped them get the right gift for her middle brother Jack because they just didn’t have enough until she’d chipped in.  Or how Miriam knew she needed to stand just around the corner of the school building and stick her foot out right at three thirty-five.  It sprained her ankle when she tripped the school bully who was running up to her other middle brother Markel to hurt him after school.  Seeing that piece of crap faceplant and embarrassing himself had been worth the sore foot.  Her brother had gained a lot of respect for his older sister that day months ago.  

Both of her middle brothers had gone from those two instances of Miriam’s interference to start playing basketball more seriously.  Jack had gotten new shoes that helped his flat feet while Markel wasn’t made late for his first practice.  They’d both impressed the middle school coaches.  Miriam was quite pleased with the little helper gift she’d received from the red-eyed lady in white.  

Yet tonight, she was honestly very very scared of what she saw coming and what she had to do to make it come to pass.  Marvin was in danger, but Miriam didn’t know from whom or when.  She only knew what she had to do if it came to pass.  She hoped this time that her gift was wrong.  Marvin was only five and didn’t need this crap in his young life.

Sitting up in bed again, Miriam quickly jotted her dream down in her diary.  She’d been doing that ever since she’d started this dreaming crap but tonight, Miriam was really not happy to see what she wrote.  She got the shivers when she saw what she’d drawn.  Especially her mom’s hand being held by the Devil’s.  Mom was a dyed in the wool Baptist, she’d never do that.  Yet to save Marvin, that’s what her mom had to do.  Putting her diary away, Miriam glanced again at the clock to see if she could get some more sleep.  Thankfully, it was only 2am, which meant she could at least hope to go back to sleep.  However, this time, she would pray she didn’t have another one of those… vision dreams.  They weren’t as fun now.



\--- Six Months Later ---

Justin Harris quickly trotted to the front door of his new home.  They’d just moved in the week prior to a big ol’ mansion type home because his wife had landed one helluva job that’d been better than their wildest dreams.  Today, Justin was gonna show off to one of his closest work friends that he hadn’t been able to see for a few years since Justin accepted a supervisor role at a new company.

Opening the door with a wide grin on his face, Justin practically hollered, “ERIC!  It’s been awhile!  Glad you could come!”

Eric Johnson was smiling too and seemed quite happy to be there.  He reached out a hand to Justin.  “Hey, Justin!  Man, you got some nice new digs here!  This’s like Bel Aire nice!”

Justin, a big burley black man in his late forties was damned proud of the praise.  “Yeah, it is!  Come in! Come in.  How was the drive?”

His buddy Eric, a skinnier black man who’d been Justin’s friend for about ten years where they’d met at Justin’s old construction company shook Justin’s hand, removed his ball cap with the New York Yankee’s logo on it, before stepping in.  They were both dressed down today since it was Sunday.  Eric was in town and had called Justin to catch up.  Which immediately got him a dinner invite.

Eric whistled at what was clearly a step up from what he remembered of Justin’s old, cramped home.  “How in the hell did you guys afford this?  You win the lottery or sumthin’?”

Justin laughed in pure glee at this moment.  Especially since his wife Trudy came bouncing around the corner from the dining room to the grand foyer entrance.  “I did!  I won the job lottery, baby!”

Eric held out his arms and Trudy came in to give him a big hug.  When done, he had to ask, “What job did you land?!  It’s gotta be a sight better than Justin’s Supervisor position at Wayfield Construction, huh?”

Trudy, beaming at him, nodded rapidly, “Yeah it is, baby.  You’re looking at the General Manager for the Donovan’s Horse Training, Cattle Raising, and Tactical Enterprises Ranch.  That’s a fancy show-horse ranch about thirty minutes up the road.  My boss gots lots of horses and stuff, but I’m also helpin’ him with all the military stuff he gots goin’ on too.  Basically, I get to double dip with all the horse and cattle scheduling as well as fieldin’ calls along with his other manager and such for the training center he runs.  It’s been fantastic!”

“I’ll say!” Eric said, genuinely happy for them.  Looking around though while they led him to a big living room where they could sit a little before dinner, he hoped that what he’d come there for would be available.  His life depended on it.

While they chatted more about Justin and Trudy’s shift in fortune, their recent move, their plans for the future, Miriam’s accomplishments and goals for getting into a medical school, Eric kept an eye out for an opportunity.  He soon heard some of them coming downstairs and he hoped for a miracle.  

Miriam was a beautiful sixteen-year-old black girl who was way too smart for how pretty she was.  Eric was leery of her though because while she smiled and shook his hand, she didn’t seem too friendly towards him.  A few minutes later, Justin’s younger boys Jack and Markel clomped down the steps to greet him.  They were all smiles and laughed at Eric’s jokes.  They felt at ease with him, which was great, but they were thirteen and fourteen respectfully and so, not what Eric needed.  It was when the small five-year-old, Marvin bounced down the steps then ran to his dad’s arms to be picked up that Eric felt encouraged that his life would soon turn around for the better.  His creditors had lined up a lot of money for the right kid to be brought to them for extensive medical trials and this happy boy was perfect.  Homeless or runaways weren’t healthy enough, but the boy in Justin’s arms was perfect.  A perfect stack of cash to help Eric slip quietly out of reach from others who were keen to do some unsavory things to Eric’s life.

After dinner, Eric, Justin, and Trudy were out on the porch enjoying a coffee and talking some more.  Eric sat his empty cup down on the small wood table next to his rocking chair.  He was getting a little anxious now.  He had to make an opportunity soon.

Looking over to his friend, Eric said with less enthusiasm, “Justin.  I’m truly happy your family is doin’ so good.”

Justin raised his cup to him, but when he caught Eric just staring out into the yard towards the little old shed that Justin had hauled with him from his old home, he could tell that Eric had something on his mind.  “Eric?  You got something goin’ on?”

Eric smiled, but didn’t look at him.  “Yeah.  I lost my job.”

Trudy set her cup down too, looking at Justin’s shocked face.  They both turned to Eric.  She said worriedly, “What happened?  I thought you was doin’ good there?”

Eric laughed a little, but it wasn’t a happy laugh.  “No.  Not as good as I thought.  The owners cut back.  Well, more like they got caught cutting corners and had to sell off to save the business.  One week, I’m watching over some condos goin’ up… the next… I’m watchin’ my life go down the toilet.”

Justin leaned over a little, to look at Eric a bit more sternly, “You had a six-figure job, how come you…?”

Eric cut him off. “Gambling.  That’s why I’m broke.  I’ve got enough to go look for something but not enough for the debts.  Not enough to save my home.  Not enough to…”

Justin glanced at Trudy again.  Then Justin said solemnly, “I can float you something… at least for a little bit.  But we ain’t completely set yet either.”

Eric smiled at the yard, still not looking at Justin nor his wonderful wife.  “I’d appreciate anything you can do.”

“If we give you something, you can’t gamble it away.”

Eric closed his eyes and hung his head.  “I know. I… uhm.  Well.  Just need something to get them off my back.  I guess till I can find something better.”

Trudy nudged her husband.  “Hey.  Go get my checkbook.  I can cover it.  We can just hold off on getting’ me a newer truck for another year.”

Justin didn’t like that but nodded.  “Yeah.  Jake’s got a good mechanic on call.  We can make it last a little longer.”

“Yeah, baby.”

Justin stood up and patted Eric’s shoulder.  “We’ll help.”

Eric looked up at Justin, hating himself for both the kindness that he was taking and the guilt that was already eating at him for the betrayal that he was about to commit.  But if he could snag a healthy boy for that organization to use as a guinea pig, he could wash away that guilt with the few million he’d get.  Underground drug R&D were pretty ruthless, especially since that company was close to a multi-billion-dollar breakthrough in their cancer research.  So this was just another small investment to them to facilitate getting over the finish line.  “Thanks, hoss.  Thanks.”

Justin smiled wanly at him before heading back inside.  Just when he opened the front door, out popped Marvin with a big red metal firetruck.  “Hey Dad!  I wanna show Uncle Eric my new firetruck!”

Laughing at his boy, Justin scrubbed his head a little. “Go ahead.  I’ll be right back.”

Eric smiled at the little boy who set his firetruck down that was literally just about his size to then roll it over to him making all the sounds of the sirens as he did so.  Trudy was laughing loudly at her boy’s antics.

“Hey there!  Where’s the fire?!” Eric asked enthusiastically.

Marvin looked up at him excited at his new uncle joining in so quickly, “It’s right in front of you, Uncle Eric!”

“Oh no!  My coffee cup!” Eric exclaimed playfully.  He then snatched up the empty cup just so Marvin could pretend to put it out with the hose he pulled out of the little truck.  When he was done, Marvin seemed very pleased with his heroics.  

Eric held his now extinguished coffee cup up to Trudy.  “Trudy, would you mind if I get a refill while I tell Marvin all about the fire me and his dad helped put out when one of our projects got hit by a car?”

“OH WOW!!!!!  REALLY!!  YOU PUT OUT A REAL FIRE!!!” Marvin said near the top of his lungs.

“I sure did!” Eric said not as loud.

Trudy got up and happily took his mug.  “Baby, don’t give him any ideas.  I don’t need him jumping into any burning buildings till after he learns how to clean his room.”

Marvin stuck out his tongue at Trudy who laughed while also swatting his bottom lightly.  “Watch yo-self, little boy,” she said laughingly.

Eric watched Trudy go back inside.  When the door closed, Eric looked down at Marvin and said quickly, “Hey.  So, I was wondering.  I brought a few toys that I was gonna donate tomorrow, but if you want first crack at ‘em, I could let you pick out one or two from my car.  Wanna?”

Marvin was very enthusiastic about that.  “Yeah!  What’cha got?!”

A lot of supplements promise the world but deliver disappointment. But what happened after I actually tried SLIM BOOST TEA? Let’s just say: **my body, energy, and life haven't been the same since**. In this honest 2025 review, I’m going to share **my complete personal experience**, **what I liked**, **what could be better**, and most importantly — why I believe SLIM BOOST TEA is **worth every penny in the USA, Canada and UK**.

**✔️Why I Started Using SLIM BOOST TEA**

At 45, I felt older than I should.

· I was tired all the time.

· My focus was fading.

· My joints ached.

· I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.

· And worst of all, I was starting to **lose my confidence**.

Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted **real answers** and a **real solution**.

That’s when I discovered **SLIM BOOST TEA** – a supplement designed to **restore metabolism health** (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

**⚡ What is SLIM BOOST TEA?**

SLIM BOOST TEA is a **science-backed, metabolism-targeted health supplement**. Its goal? To speed up your weight loss results by improving metabolism function — which influences **energy, immunity, mental clarity, muscle performance**, and even **longevity**.

Key benefits they promise:

· Boost energy naturally

· Improve focus and brain performance

· Support healthy weight management

· Reduce joint pain and inflammation

· Fight cellular aging

To be honest, it felt like a **too-good-to-be-true checklist**. But I gave it a shot.

**✅What’s Inside SLIM BOOST TEA? (And Why It Matters)**

What made SLIM BOOST TEA stand out for me was the **premium, research-backed ingredients** that target real metabolism health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.

Some of the star ingredients include:

· **Costa Rican Green Tea**

· **Wuyi Oolong Tea**

· **Kerala Garcinia Cambogia**

· **Indonesian Lemongrass**

· **European Dandelion Leaves**

· **Korean Ginseng Root**

· **Indian Senna Leaves**

· **Licorice Root**

· **Peppermint**

· **Mediterranean Orange Peel**

· **Ginger**

· **Fennel Fruit**

· **Monk Fruit**

· **Ceylon Cinnamon Bark**

· **Natural Lemon and Mint Flavor**

Together, these ingredients form a **synergistic formula** that targets the **root cause of fatigue and aging** — metabolism decline.

**✅ My 30-Day SLIM BOOST TEA Experience: What Changed?**

I took **SLIM BOOST TEA** exactly as instructed — drink two to three times a day for best benefits. Here's what happened week by week:

**✅ Week 1:**

· Slight increase in morning energy

· Clearer mental focus during work

· No crash in the afternoon like before

**✅ Week 2:**

· Woke up before my alarm — feeling refreshed

· Digestion felt smoother

· Less brain fog

· I started to feel “lighter”

**✅ Week 3:**

· My energy levels felt **stable and strong all day**

· I could **focus better at work for longer periods**

· My workouts improved — less joint pain

· I noticed a **mood boost** too — more optimistic

**✅ Week 4:**

· I felt like **I got my younger self back**

· I stopped reaching for coffee

· My weight dropped by 3 pounds

· I felt **clear-headed, more active, and even happier**

**✅Real Benefits I Noticed with SLIM BOOST TEA**

After one month, here’s what changed drastically:

· ⚡ **Energy:** I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.

· ✔️**Focus**: Mental clarity and attention improved big time.

· ✔️ **Metabolism**: My body felt more active. I started burning fat faster.

· ✔️**Recovery**: Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.

· ✔️**Joint Relief**: Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.

· ✨ **Overall Mood:** I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.

**✅ SLIM BOOST TEA Complaints: What You Should Know**

No review is honest without mentioning the **downsides** — and yes, SLIM BOOST TEA has a few:

**1. Not Instant**

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a **science-backed long-term upgrade**.

**2. Premium Price**

It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — **it’s worth the investment**.

**3. Limited Stock**

This actually frustrated me: SLIM BOOST TEA **sells out often**. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 3–5 packets upfront.

**✅Is SLIM BOOST TEA Worth It in 2025?**

Absolutely, **yes**.If you’re:

· Feeling constantly tired

· Struggling with brain fog or poor memory

· Battling joint pain

· Gaining unwanted weight

· Or just feel like you're “aging too fast”

Then SLIM BOOST TEA can literally be the **missing piece** in your daily routine.

Unlike cheap energy boosters, SLIM BOOST TEA works **deep inside your cells** to fix what’s broken. That’s why the results are **real and lasting**.

**✅Final Verdict: Should You Buy SLIM BOOST TEA?**

**SLIM BOOST TEA is not a gimmick.**It’s a **premium, advanced metabolism support supplement** that delivers real results. I’ve tried dozens of products over the years — but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.

If you’re serious about taking control of your health in 2025 — SLIM BOOST TEA is the **#1 product I recommend**. Period.

I have expressed to her before that she needs to stop pushing this onto me, but she continues to do so, and as a person with a huge amount of anxiety, I really hate this. She keeps on promising this guy that I will eventually go out with him, and I hate the thought that she's leading him on. I have no interest in him whatsoever, but he's really sweet and doesn't deserve to be lead on like this, and by my mother on my behalf at that.

Today was kind of my breaking point, and that's why i'm writing this because I don't know what to do. My mom came home from work WAYYY too excited, came into my room, and told me to put my makeup on and look ""presentable"" because she wants me to visit her work just to talk to him. I told her to stop, and she keeps on insisting. I eventually went to the store (her workplace) staying in the car with my dog, and she comes back with a coffee in hand from him.

I think it was a sweet gestures, but I feel so bad and now I feel like I HAVE to talk to him because he spent money on me to get me a drink. I'm just really stressed about it, and she's not getting it. My dad has told her because I complained to him about it, and she got all touchy saying ""I'm not pushing him onto you."" Every conversation we have, she mentions him.

I have maturely tried to tell her that I am not looking for a relationship because I feel like i'm just not ready, and I don't want to be in a one-sided relationship where only one party has feeling. I mean I barely feel like messaging my friends, and I barely manage to even talk to my friends now because it just feels like a chore due to me having mental health issues.

So, I don't know why she thinks i'm ready for a relationship when l've already told her about all of this.

Whether it’s working from a cafe, going for a run, traveling, or just zoning out at home, I’ve realized that no single pair is perfect for every situation. That said, if you’re looking for a top-tier pair in the $150–$250 range and you're using Android, I’d definitely recommend checking out the Sony WF-1000XM5 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II.

The Sony WF-1000XM5 is kind of my go-to for travel or when I want to really immerse myself. I used them on a flight recently, and the noise canceling was so good it actually felt like I was in a quiet room—not surrounded by a hundred other passengers. The sound is rich and super customizable through the Sony app, and I love how the Adaptive Sound Control adjusts based on where I am—like switching from quiet mode at a café to ambient mode when I’m walking outside. It’s a smart touch that makes a difference when you're constantly changing environments.

The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II, on the other hand, are my “I need silence now” earbuds. I pull them out when I’m trying to focus in a noisy space—like a busy coffee shop or even at home when someone’s watching TV in the next room. The fit is insanely comfortable, and the noise canceling is the best I’ve experienced, hands down. They also sound fantastic, especially with podcasts and acoustic music—very clear and natural.

Then there are the Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, which I tend to use for everyday stuff, especially when I’m pairing them with my phone or tablet. I love how smoothly they switch between devices, and they’re great for quick calls or workouts. The fit is snug but not too tight, and I don’t worry about sweat or rain since they’re water-resistant. If you’re using a Samsung device, they really shine thanks to the extra features like 360 Audio and high-res support.

Each of these earbuds brings something different to the table, depending on the vibe and what I need in the moment.

1kergpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kergpt/my_date_was_horrible_i_wish_i_had_never_gone/,My date was horrible; I wish I had never gone,"So, I (18f) recently went on a date with a 22M (I’ll call him Daniel) I met on Instagram. He’s a uni student, and his family owns a jewelry store. After talking for two days, we decided to meet for coffee at a mall near my house. He lives on the east side of the city, and I’m on the west side (almost a 2-hour public transit trip), so I appreciated him making the effort to come.

From the moment we met, things felt off. I was anxious (I hadn’t told my family, so I was feeling guilty), and when I told him not to touch me, he hugged me anyway. At Starbucks, I wanted to pay for myself, but he insisted. He sat right next to me when I asked him to sit across, started touching me, and called me his “girlfriend,” even though I hadn’t agreed to that. When I told him I was uncomfortable, he ignored me. He touched my face, said weird stuff like he wanted to kiss every part of my body, and started talking about marriage, where we’d honeymoon, and what we’d name our kids. Then he got jealous of my best friend (a gay guy named Ethan) and said things like he could easily overpower him. He even asked, “Ethan or me?” and wouldn’t let go of my hand. At one point, he said he was going to kiss me. I kept saying “no,” and he grabbed my face to try to turn it toward him. I resisted, so he only managed to kiss my cheek. He then said he wished we had gone somewhere more private, and he laughed, saying we’d do that on our next date.

Luckily, my cousin Emma (who I brought along as backup) called me to the food court. We sat where she could see us. I again told him to sit across from me, but he kept trying to sit next to me and touch me. He said I owed him a kiss because he “came all that way,” and when I said I didn’t want to, he said, “That’s just how I am.” Things got stranger when he said I’d have to give him my Instagram password, stop talking to Ethan, and take his last name when we got married. In an effort to make him uninterested in me I told him I wanted to keep my last name and give it to my future kids. He laughed in my face and said no man would ever accept that because “a woman belongs to the man” after marriage. He called himself “a caveman” on these matters. He mocked my last name and pulled away when I kept pushing back. I suggested combining our surnames, but he refused and repeated the same sexist stuff.

Eventually, Emma and her boyfriend came over and said we had to leave. On the way out, I kept arguing with him about the surname thing. At the door, he said, “So that’s it? You’re letting a clean, good guy like me go over a stupid issue like this? If you think any man would accept that, you’re naive,” and then walked away.

I blocked him everywhere. Now, I feel horrible. How could I have been this blind? I should’ve never gone.",1,1746385171.0,offmychest,5,0.67,False
1kerg6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1kerg6d/hard_not_to_be_annoyed_and_judge/,Hard not to be annoyed and judge,"Sil and her husband are so incredibly financially unstable. I’m not even sure they know what actually being adults is. Yeah sure he has a job and she is a sahm to their 3 kids….. but
They live with my bfs parents. Always have since they had their first kid together in 2020, her husband came with a little boy. We thought okay.. unplanned pregnancy, early 20s and pandemic. But they have never even made an attempt to save money and then PLANNED to have another baby who is now 8 months. They’re on food stamps.. okay that’s fine.. everyone needs a little help.
But they’re constantly just buying crap, the kids have SO many toys. The house is a fucking disaster. Their laundry room is literally filled with dirty clothes like all over the floor, some in baskets..
It’s like they’d rather just go out and buy more clothes instead of actually washing their stuff like normal people. Whenever they get a tax return.. they plan a vacation or they pretty much blow through it on eating out, more toys, clothes, shoes, buying coffee and redbulls everyday, vapes..
I’m pretty close with my bfs mom and she vents to me everyday. Today, she is doing her granddaughter’s laundry.. 2 baskets full. She’s a toddler mind you so tiny clothes .. 2 baskets full is a lot .. because she doesn’t have any clean clothes or underwear .. ? While sil and her husband are out shopping for her birthday presents. And they’re driving around his moms car bc theirs doesn’t work all of a sudden, mind you, this car has had problems for a while and they just ignore it until something happens and then do the bare minimum to get it going again. They literally just got it less than 2 years ago after they didn’t take care of the first car they had. And most of the times, bfs mom pays for the car to get fixed bc she feels bad. They have cats who just keep getting pregnant bc they don’t bring them to the vet for anything. They kept a kitten from the last litter and I know for a fact, that thing has never left the house except for when it got out of the house when it was in heat and surprise.. is now pregnant.. the cats shit all over the house because they never clean the litter boxes. The bathrooms are horrendous. I literally will bring Clorox wipes with me to wipe down the toilet before I use it. Yeah, their parents aren’t the cleanest either but I think it would be a lot more manageable if they weren’t there continuously trashing the place and not teaching their kids to clean up after themselves. It’s like why should she clean up after a family of 5 when it’s their mess but she eventually does it anyway otherwise the house would literally go to shit. They’re always asking to borrow money.. at first I would lend them $5 here, $20 there……. Never go any of it back. They literally asked to borrow our truck today to go shopping bc their truck wouldn’t start. I said no.. the last time they used my truck.. they left empty coffee cups and dirty napkins on my floor after their dd stop. If you can’t clean up after yourself while borrowing someone’s vehicle then you’re not borrowing it ever again. I am a clean person so yeah, it bothers me really badly but also just the total lack of comprehension about what real life is. They did look at apartments online I guess bc they were outraged at the prices they saw and then never looked again… they really have no fucking idea. ",1,1746385130.0,venting,2,1.0,False

For the past month, I’ve been experiencing chest pain and decided to get it checked. I had an ECG, which came back normal, and the doctor referred me to a psychiatrist. I was prescribed medication for anxiety and to help with sleep.

For a few weeks, I felt normal and had no pain. Occasionally, there was mild chest pain, which I assumed was due to anxiety or panic attack.

However, this morning, I experienced a deep, stabbing pain on the left side of my chest. There was no sweating, dizziness, or shortness of breath. At times, felt numbness in my hands and arms. The stabing pain was occasional but it persisted throughout the day.

I went to the hospital again and had an ECG and got checked echocardiogram, which I did 2 days back. Lipid profile and X ray were also normal. The cardiologist said everything looked normal and prescribed pantoprazole 40mg. (Got it checked by two different cardiologists.)

But the chest pain still persists and I'm worried. 


Pain is usually when I'm sitting or laying down. I go for brisk walk every morning  but never feel it  Also, sometimes chest pressure is followed by passing gas and urge to poop(usually at night). Sometimes pain lingers towards left shoulder.
I don't smoke or drink but, I do consume coffee and tea on a regular basis.

What additional tests can I do to be reassured that the symptoms are not cardiac?
Do I need an endoscopy?

Whether it’s working from a cafe, going for a run, traveling, or just zoning out at home, I’ve realized that no single pair is perfect for every situation. That said, if you’re looking for a top-tier pair in the $150–$250 range and you're using Android, I’d definitely recommend checking out the Sony WF-1000XM5 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II.

The Sony WF-1000XM5 is kind of my go-to for travel or when I want to really immerse myself. I used them on a  flight recently and the noise canceling was so good it actually felt like I was in a quiet room—not surrounded by a hundred other passengers. The sound is rich and super customizable through the Sony app, and I love how the Adaptive Sound Control adjusts based on where I am—like switching from quiet mode at a café to ambient mode when I’m walking outside. It’s a smart touch that makes a difference when you're constantly changing environments.

The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II, on the other hand, are my “I need silence now” earbuds. I pull them out when I’m trying to focus in a noisy space—like a busy coffee shop or even at home when someone’s watching TV in the next room. The fit is insanely comfortable, and the noise canceling is the best I’ve experienced, hands down. They also sound fantastic, especially with podcasts and acoustic music—very clear and natural.

Then there’s the Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, which I tend to use for everyday stuff, especially when I’m pairing them with my phone or tablet. I love how smoothly they switch between devices, and they’re great for quick calls or workouts. The fit is snug but not too tight, and I don’t worry about sweat or rain since they’re water-resistant. If you’re using a Samsung device, they really shine thanks to the extra features like 360 Audio and high-res support.

Each has its strengths depending on the vibe you're going for.",1,1746384905.0,CrackSoundTech,0,1.0,False

John Watson quietly hummed to himself as he walked through the back of Baker Field Café, a brown apron tied around his waist and a dark red shirt with the company logo on the breast. 

Flipping the light switches, the blond man looked to the clock on the wall ""fifteen early...I really should have slept in"" he mumbled to himself, covering a yawn as he fired up the machines and turned on the radio; the smell of brewing coffee filling Café and steadily encouraging him to wake up. 

Baker Field Café, an inherited shop that John has taken over when the owner passed, had four tables and two booths; although it wasn't busy, customers were steady and John was kept busy on most days.

Looking to the grey clouds that hung low and the fog already rolling in, John gave a nod to himself as he decided the daily special.
Fresh roasted coffee, steamed milk, and a double shot of espresso; room for syrup or sugar as requested. Warm, bitter, but enough to wake you up. 
While the shop had technically come free to him, so had the debt; and while John was able to keep things running on his own, he was burning out and frankly needed help. 
Making one for himself, John set the cup by the register and pulled up a stool as he tried to occupy the time reading the help ad he had posted in the morning paper.",1,1746384784.0,u_KitKatSnake,0,1.0,False

I just can't seem to moderate anything that feels good. for e.g.

* If i buy a 8 pack of soft drinks. I'll just end up binging them all in one night rather than spreading them out
* I'll go clean off of porn and masturbation for 5 days +, feel really good and then binge and literally relapse 4 times in a night and feel like shit the next day
* I can't just play a video game for an hour, as soon as i start playing i'll play the day away once i start
* I can't just have one coffee a day and call it there. As soon as i get the taste for it. i'll end up drinking 3 or 4 and make myself feel anxious and shit and then have terrible sleep to restart the cycle again the next day until i try to give it up for a few days
* i'll skip the gym one day and that'll turn into 2 into 3 into a week just off missing one

It's like my brain just has an addictive personality where once it enjoys something, it will do that thing to excess and im basically in a situation where i either go without something completely or over consume it when i do have it

I started the weekend off by doing a deep clean of the rear bench but had to hold off from masking and painting due to the weather. A whole bunch of that brown gunk that stained the carpet came out of it, seems like someone dropped a whole cup full of espresso coffee and let it soak. That’s what I’m hoping it was at least.. After it was clean I hung it up to dry with a fan blowing, it’ll be ready for next weekend though. 

Moved inside and pulled the rear tail lights out for full LED bulb upgrades, last thing needed before I finished with the interior plastics. Fortunately I bought all the right sizes of LED’s and made sure to get the no-error turn signals so we’ll see how that works out. 

Finished installing the side surround plastics and the back piece, cleaned it all and had enough screws too, and I felt very lucky because I found all the little plastic access panel covers the whole way around. Once the plastics were in I could put the RSX foam tire cover that I got from the junkyard back in, and it fits like a glove! By the way, check out the hand print in carpet in the 3rd picture, if that’s not an indicator that the carpet is still soft after painting I don’t know what is. Cleaned up my original (and uncut) rear shelf for install and cleaned the rear glass as a huzzah!

Moved on to the console area next, I’m not showing a bunch of pictures of it for obvious reasons but I installed the JDI relay conversion and kill switch for a bit of security from the car walking off on me. Cleaned up some stray wires under the dash and got the metal panel back it, I won’t have to worry about pulling wire bundles out when I get in the car anymore. Got nervous about screws at this point, that center console piece takes 10! Silly thing to worry about but my stock of the black Honda screws is pretty depleted. I got it all in and I’ll need 4 more for the knee plastics so I’ll just make it. 

Still have to mess with the gauge cluster, dash surround, then clean, paint, and install the front seats, then paint the rear seats before I absolutely have to drop the fuel tank and replace the fuel pump to progress any further. Obviously I’m not looking forward to it and I’ve been putting it off, but it’s looming so I’ll hulk up and get it done.",9,1746384766.0,Integra,1,1.0,False

Alternatively, check out your nearest Arabic grocery store. They usually carry a brand called *Haseeb*, which is often cheaper than Finnish brands like Juhla Mokka or Presidentti.

This all happened between 2019 and 2021, but it’s taken me four years to finally feel ready to talk about it. I’m not proud of everything that happened, but I survived it. And I think I’ve finally made peace with all of it.

I (27F) met Mark (33M) when I was 20. He was older, calm, successful, and exactly what I thought I wanted. He had studied Economics, worked in finance, and always looked like he walked out of a GQ shoot. He was confident, mature, and everyone around me thought I was “lucky” to land a guy like that.

Six months in, I met his family—and that’s when I met his younger brother, Dylan (31M now, 25 back then when I met him, but 27 when everything really exploded).

Dylan was Mark’s opposite in every way. Mark wore crisp button-downs and tailored pants. Dylan wore worn jeans, had tattoos peeking out under his sleeves, played guitar at dive bars, and worked as an attorney—taking mostly pro bono cases and helping out neighbors like it was second nature. He was warm. Grounded. Present.

The first time we hung out, just the two of us, he took me to get my first tattoo. It was impulsive. I loved it.

Mark didn’t. He freaked out. Told me it was unprofessional, asked if I did it to impress Dylan. That was our first serious fight. He guilted me so hard I nearly booked a removal appointment. That was the beginning of a long pattern—gaslighting, emotional control, subtle manipulation.

Still, I stayed. We got engaged. My parents adored him. They thought he was respectful, stable, good on paper. They didn’t see what went on in private—how he criticized how I dressed, how he made me feel needy for wanting basic affection, how he dismissed my anxiety and told me I was “too emotional.”

Then Dylan brought his girlfriend, Camila, to a family BBQ. She was sweet, warm, polite. We got along weirdly well. We started doing things together—grabbing coffee, going to yoga, texting about stupid shows. I even told her things I probably shouldn’t have told a new friend, like how I felt unsure in my engagement sometimes.

I noticed Camila and Mark acting... strange. They avoided eye contact. Their conversations were short, awkward. Something felt off, but I couldn’t explain it.

Then, at dinner with a mutual friend, I found out: “Isn’t it weird Dylan’s dating Mark’s ex?”

That sentence flipped my world.

Camila had dated Mark for two years before I entered the picture. No one told me. Not Mark. Not Dylan. Not even Camila—who had plenty of time to mention it during our coffee dates. I felt humiliated.

After that, I watched. Mark became cold. Distant. Always on his phone. Camila was around more, and she and Mark barely spoke in front of people—but I caught glances. Looks that said too much.

Meanwhile, Dylan was the opposite. When I had to visit my aunt in another city, he drove me. When our cat had a health emergency, he left work and took us to the vet because Mark “couldn’t leave a meeting.” He brought me coffee. Asked how I really was. He didn’t flirt. He just showed up like a decent human being.

Then came the texts. Mark left his phone on the bed. I wasn’t snooping—but the screen lit up.

Camila. The messages were... intimate.

“I still think about that weekend.” “Sometimes I wish things had gone differently.” “You felt like home.”

I froze. My chest hurt. But I didn’t say anything—not yet.

Days later, I asked Mark what was wrong between us. He said I was being dramatic. I asked if he was speaking to Camila. He said I was insecure. Classic deflection.

Later, I used his laptop to email my sister and curiosity got the better of me. I opened a folder I shouldn’t have.

Photos. Chats. Hotel receipts. Videos.

They’d been sleeping together the whole time. After Camila was introduced to me. After she smiled at me and asked if I wanted to do brunch. After she told me she hoped I’d be her sister-in-law.

I didn’t eat or sleep properly for three days. Mark didn’t seem to notice—or care. He continued texting her like nothing had happened.

I was punishing myself, thinking what did I do wrong? I grew up watching healthy relationships—my parents, my siblings. I didn’t want to be the one who failed before even getting married.

And then… came the family dinner.

Every Saturday. Always at their parents’ house. Dylan and I cooked with their mom while Mark grilled with their dad. Camila showed up, quiet, jittery. It was all too much.

At the dinner table, Mark made a joke about me and Dylan “always laughing together.”

I snapped.

“Maybe I just prefer honesty,” I said.

He smirked. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“Maybe I like people who don’t lie about who they’ve slept with.”

Silence.

I turned to Dylan.

“You didn’t know? Camila and Mark dated before me. And they’ve been sleeping together again. I saw the messages. The photos. The receipts.”

Dylan froze. Then, calmly, he stood and punched Mark in the face. No shouting. No fight. Just one hard hit.

I left. That night, I told Mark I knew everything. At first, he denied it. Then minimized it. Then blamed me.

I kicked him out.

The next day, I texted Camila. I didn’t scream or insult her. I just said I knew. She replied, “It wasn’t supposed to happen.” I told her I didn’t hate her, but I’d never trust her again—and we were done. Forever.

Mark left town within a month. Dylan went no contact with him. Their parents were devastated—but they didn’t defend Mark. Their dad said, “You reap what you sow.” Their mom cried a lot, but said she still hoped Dylan would find love again one day. She just didn’t know it would be with me.

My own parents were shocked. My mom kept saying, “He fooled us.” My dad, who adored Mark, actually apologized to me—for pressuring me to settle down. They hated how much I’d hidden my unhappiness.

Two months later, Dylan invited me to the Super Bowl. I almost said no. But I went. We laughed. We drank beer. We screamed at the screen like teenagers. It was fun.

We started dating. Carefully. Slowly. No big declarations. No rushing.

One night, that same mutual friend told me something I’ll never forget:

“You know, you and Dylan were supposed to go on a date before all this, right?”

Apparently, Dylan had been invited to a group dinner the same night I met Mark. I was supposed to be his blind date. But Dylan got into a minor car accident on the way and couldn’t come. I sat next to Mark instead.

I remembered hearing sirens that night.

I just didn’t know they were for Dylan.

Now? I’m 27. Dylan and I are married. We live in a little house with a white fence—exactly the kind Mark once mocked as “boring.” We have twin toddlers, two dogs, and a lazy cat named Mango. I have four tattoos. The third one? Dylan gave me on our anniversary.

Dylan and Mark haven’t spoken in years. Dylan says he’s at peace with it. Forgiven, but not forgotten. He doesn’t miss him.

Camila moved away. I don’t think about her often. But when I do, I remember her holding my hand during brunch, talking about trust.

All I know is this:

I spent years convincing myself that being controlled was the same as being loved.

It’s not.

Love doesn’t punish. Love doesn’t gaslight. Love doesn’t betray you and then blame you for bleeding.

Sometimes, the truth wrecks everything.

But sometimes… it sets you free.",271,1746384621.0,TrueOffMyChest,56,0.88,False

I got temporary medicine for a week that includes lorazepam and Zoloft. I used lorazepam very few times when I felt anxious. However, I never touched Zoloft. I graduated and my anxiety stopped though I stopped drinking coffee and consuming restaurants food and fast food and anything that contains too much sodium. 6 months later with no anxiety I started drinking coffee again and didn't care much about my sodium intake. However one day I got gunpowder green tea and prepared it with mint (Moroccan style since I am Moroccan) I had it breakfast and I immediately started feeling anxious and my heart went up to 140.

1keqygt,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1keqygt/positive_experience_with_kaiser_observations_my/,"Positive experience with Kaiser: Observations, my prep list and pre/post op timeline","**Overall observations:**

1. I’m glad I over prepared because it put me in the best possible position to recover in comfort. 

2. I checked my notes after each visit and they used Z30.9 and Z30.2 diagnostic codes. Kaiser Northern California.

3. I did have to pay $100 for the pre-op appointment and medication was $27. Not going to argue this as it’s likely because we went over family history that was relevant. The code for familial cancer history was included in that.

4. I did not need the cough drops, probably because my surgery was only 16 minutes.

5. I meal-prepped a lot of fiber-rich foods but my appetite was completely shot as I wasn’t hungry and it would make my stomach bloating worse. I found drinking was a lot easier as I could take sips throughout the day- soups, kombucha, sugar free gatorade, water, my ginger tea concoction, ginger ale, juice shots, sparkling water, smoothies with protein added, orange juice, peppermint tea, coffee with collagen.

6. Gas x didn’t help with the bloating but liquids, walking, and finally having a BM did.

7. I did not have gas pain. Overall minimal pain, just uncomfortable. 

8. My 5 most useful purchases were 1. Copious amounts of liquids 2. Pillow for the seatbelt and keep you upright in bed 3. Toilet seat booster as American toilets are childishly short 4. Stool softeners + miralax and 5. Compression socks 


9. My nurses and doctors were all so nice and supportive and friendly.

**This was my prep list:**

1. Prep hospital bag- pillow for seatbelt, loose sweats, easy shirt, sweater jacket, slip on shoes, ID and insurance card, phone, a toiletry bag of cough drops, pad, chapstick, lotion, snack, gatorade. (did not use cough drop or pad or snack)

2. Meal prepped fiber rich foods- soups, veggie enchiladas, dal, oatmeal with chia, snacks. Put in easy reach spots in the fridge and counter

3. Stocked up on drinks

4. Secured rugs and cords

5. Did the Costco run for any large or heavy items that I knew needed restocking with the next 4 weeks like toilet paper and laundry detergent 

6. Put everything I use daily and might need within reach, I don’t usually keep my shoes out or cleaning spray + cloth out but they were helpful so I didn’t need to bend over to my shoe rack or dig under the sink if I spilled something 

7. I set every reading they gave, gauze, medication, skincare, a stack of clean PJs and underwear/compression socks, clean towels and easy outfits for walks all out on the bathroom counter

8. Deep cleaned my bathroom, bedroom, living room, and kitchen

9. Watered all my plants

10. Changed all the bedding and did all the laundry

11. Filled up gas tank the night before

12. Cleaned all the water bottles and got a set of disposable cups, plates, cutlery, and meal prep containers so I could rest more and avoid bending over to use the dishwasher

13. Before I left for the hospital I made my bed, set my laptop and heating pad up for easy use, put a filled icy water bottle by my bedside, and took out trash and recycling

14. Set small bags for daily trash and recycling on counters so I could carry them out, not bend over, and keep my space clean. 

**Timeline:**

2/28: 
Made this appointment specifically for sterilization consultation. Upon entering the room I was given the sterilization consent form to read over before the Dr came. We discussed what I wanted and my family history, health background. Dr went over the bisalp procedure with me and just made sure I understood. I was not bingo'd, just checked to make sure I was fully informed. He did not bring up tubal at all for me, bisalp was his choice because of better outcomes. He was very nice.

3/1:
Surgery scheduler called me and sadly I would’ve had to wait longer for my surgery if I did it with Dr so I picked other Dr for my surgery. I actually knew of her through a friend who had nothing but praise for her and how nice she is. I also scheduled pre op appointment, a consultation with Dr, a phone call to go over the surgical care kit, and a post op phone call.

3/25:
Had my Pre op appointment and went over health history, background, medications. He recommended I go off birth control 1 month before to reduce blot clot risk, no vitamins/aspirin/etc 1 week before surgery, no shaving or waxing of any area 1 week before surgery, and no alcohol 1 month before surgery. He also ordered blood work 1 week before surgery.

4/14:
Met Dr who’d do surgery and we went over the finer details of the surgery and described to me the day of plan. This included that they may or may not have students observing which I consented to. That they might do a gynecological exam and insert tools in my vagina if needed (wasn’t needed). That there may be light vaginal bleeding (there wasn’t). Whole surgery itself should take 25 minutes (actually took 16) and that the prep and waking me up would take more time than the surgery itself. Went over medication that she prescribed to me and potential post op issues like gas pain. I was given a document to review about general risks like with anesthesia, infection etc. Offhandedly it sounded like bisalp is standard for this Kaiser hospital because she briefly brought up tubal but in that it’s an inferior procedure due to potential for clip failure. Picked up the surgical kit box. She sent in my prescription which I picked up 3 days later. She was very nice as well.

4/17:
Blood work and picked up prescriptions.

4/21:
Call to go over the surgical kit. 2 hours before surgery I need to drink this carb drink in 15 minutes. I also needed to shower the night before and then wipe my body with the cleansing surgical wipes provided. Confirmed no surprise costs to me.

4/22:
Called me with time to arrive at 9:45am and estimated time done at 3:30pm. Told not to eat after midnight and to drink carb drink at 7:30am, brush teeth, don’t shave, no meds, confirmed not sick, watched the anesthesia video.

4/23:
Called me again to do pre-admission, remind me what to bring and wear, not eat after midnight and again confirmed nothing owed. I ate my last meal at 6:30pm, took off my nail polish, set aside clothes for surgery and checked my hospital bag, showered at 8pm and 1 hour after used the wipes they gave me in the surgical kit. 

**4/24, Day of Surgery:**
Woke up at 6am. I slept great so I went for an hour walk with my black coffee. Got back at 7am and had a bit of water and started to get ready. At 7:30 I needed to drink the carb drink they gave me within 15 minutes and no other liquids after. Was expecting it to taste nasty but honestly not bad, like a sweeter yakult but not too sickly. Brushed teeth before leaving. Arrived at 9:45am and was taken back to my bed and given gloves, grippy socks, hospital gown, hair bonnet, 2 bags for clothes, and more wipes. It was a chilly spring day so the bed was heated which I appreciated. After they set up the IV and gave me Tylonel I was pretty relaxed and comfy so I took a light nap for about 2 hours and went to the bathroom a couple times. There was an emergency announcement twice which caused a delay for me. A few sweet nurses came to chat with me and wished me a happy birthday. An anesthesiologist came and talked with me but not the one who was doing my anesthesia, he was doing the pre op check and I appreciated it as I told him I had woken up before and he reassured me it wasn't going to happen again. Around 1:30pm my surgeon came over and said 30 minutes so I went to the bathroom one last time and was chatting with another nurse when the surgical nurse came to get me and jokingly scolded them for talking about cake when I must’ve been starving. She realized it was my birthday and got the OR team, anesthesiologist and my surgeon to “surprise” me when she wheeled me in the room. I was very touched and got a little too excited lol. They moved me to the table and got me comfortable with a blanket, leg massagers, and kept me distracted as they got ready very quickly. I had joked that they can only sing happy birthday to me if tequila was involved so they called my anesthesia the “spicy margarita” when they turned the gas on. We talked about travel and food until I knocked out. Surgery took 16 minutes. I went under at 2:06pm and woke up a little over an hour later. Asked me about my pain but I was more concerned with getting water. They gave me some ice chips first and I confirmed I was ok pain wise after I came to a bit more. I wasn’t really hungry but they wanted me to eat so I ate 2 packs of saltines and drank ice water while waiting for my mom and chatting with 2 different nurses one of which was obsessed with my skincare routine and I wrote it down for her. Surgeon came to check on me and told me I was healthy so it was a quick surgery and she’d follow up with me at my next appointment but feel free to reach out any issues or questions. My mom arrived and they gave her the post care instructions regarding showering/medications/do and don’t do, gauze packs, and tape for me. I got dressed with the nurse assisting and they wheeled me to the car, my pain was ok at this point but I was very very tired. I sipped my gatorade as I knew I’d need the hydration but I was not very hungry or thirsty, just tired. My mom took me home and I napped for 2 hours to which I woke up pretty hungry. Took Tylenol, ate and then kept it easy watching my shows/getting up every 30 minutes to walk a bit. I wouldn’t say it was pain per say, I’ve had worse periods, it was more a tiredness and uncomfortable feeling. I had no sore throat and no shoulder/gas pains. 

4/25:
Slept well but my hunger and my bladder cues were really really muted. Not painful, but uncomfortable feeling of bloating that would get worse as I ate/drank. This was the worst day for my recovery but I say that mildly. It was a privilege to be uncomfortable rather than in true pain. I went on a walk around the block but I walked very slowly as I just wanted to be gentle as I usually am a fast walker. I knew I needed calories to recover but the bloating made it hard for me to want to eat as it expanded my stomach further and intensified how uncomfortable I was. Similarly it made it hard to gauge my need to go to the bathroom so I kept checking every time I got up to walk a bit just to be sure as I didn’t need a bladder infection as well. I iced my incisions and used a heating pad on my tummy when the pressure was too much. Showered today and took a stool softener and miralax. I had a very supportive network that sent me flowers, birthday/bisalp cakes and treats, messages of love and support which made me feel great. Surgeon and nurse both called and confirmed I was ok and reiterated the post care instructions and wished me happy birthday again. 

4/26:
Felt a bit more perky today so I went out to my birthday brunch. Overall I did well other than walking a lot slower than I’m used to. Under advice from my surgeon I took off the initial cute heart shaped dressing they put on after the surgery and cleaned my incisions by rubbing soap above and letting the water rinse downward onto the site. I used a hairdryer on low to dry my belly button to avoid infection. At this point I discontinued taking Tylenol as well but no BM so I kept taking miralax, stool softeners. Still had trouble eating due to bloating. 

4/27:
Pretty much the same as the day before but moving a bit more and quicker. No BM but more appetite so ate real food with fiber especially and still the same miralax and stool softener.

4/28:
Returned to work- desk job. The eagle landed thankfully and I felt amazing after, practically skipping with joy. 

4/29:
Almost back to normal, felt much more normal appetite today, walked my usual 5 miles almost at my usual pace but was tired after. Slept on my side.

4/30: 
Pretty much back to normal other than not lifting anything heavy. Did outer “self care”, no issues. Allergy season got me sneezing as well but no pain thank fuck. Back to regular exercise routine and moving more like normal.

5/1:
Managed to sleep in my usual position on my stomach again. My stomach is back to being flat. All is well and normal in my health, exercise, and daily routine.

5/2:
Still normal and steri tape is starting to come off. 

5/3:
I wore pants! Tape is still on but coming off more and more. I wouldn’t enter a weight lifting contest or run a marathon at this point but I feel good and healthy to return to normalcy. 

5/4:
Tape has come off on my 2 lower but not in the belly button. Will remove tomorrow if not off by then. Incisions smaller than I thought and looking good.",7,1746383845.0,sterilization,0,1.0,False

1keqw8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1keqw8d/my_daughter_keeps_asking_about_the_man_in_the/,My daughter keeps asking about the man in the floorboards. We live in a fifth-floor apartment,"We moved into this apartment in February. Just me and my daughter, Ivy. It’s not much, but it’s ours. Fifth floor, decent view, rent just barely affordable. The building is old, with creaky pipes and paper-thin walls, but it's quiet and no one bothers us.

Ivy is four. She’s bright and weird in the best way. Loves bugs, talks to stuffed animals like they’re old friends, invents strange stories on the fly. I’ve always encouraged her imagination. Kids need that. Especially after what we’ve been through.

At first, it was just normal play. She’d crawl on the floor with her dolls, press her ear to the wood like she was listening for something. I asked her once what she was doing, and she told me, “He talks funny when he’s sleepy.”

I didn’t think much of it. Thought she was mimicking a TV character or something.

A few days later, while brushing her teeth, she pointed to the floor and asked if I could “tell the man to stop watching her.”

I froze. Not scared. Just thrown.

“What man?” I asked.

She pointed to the floor again. “The one who lives under the wood.”

I gave her a confused smile. “Honey, there’s nobody under there. We’re on the fifth floor, remember?”

She didn’t respond. Just rinsed and spat like nothing happened.

That night, I checked the floor while she slept. The boards were dusty but solid. No gaps. No loose panels. Still, I knelt down and tapped a few spots. Hollow, but not unusual. Old floors always sound like that.

Over the next week, Ivy started avoiding the hallway. She would step around specific boards like they were hot. She stopped sleeping in her bed and would sneak into mine without saying a word. When I asked her why, she’d just whisper, “He gets louder at night.”

I started keeping the TV on while she fell asleep. White noise, comfort. Still, I’d catch her glancing toward the floor in the middle of a show. Like she was waiting for something.

Then, two nights ago, I woke to a loud pop, like a board snapping under weight.

I rushed to her room. She was sitting upright in bed, wide-eyed, staring at the floor. I asked what happened. She pointed to a spot near the corner of the room.

One of the floorboards was slightly raised. Barely noticeable. But it hadn’t been like that before.

I pressed down on it. It gave a little, like something beneath had pushed upward.

“Did you drop something under there?” I asked.

Ivy didn’t answer. She just whispered, “You touched his door.”

Last night, I barely slept. Every creak of the building made me tense. I turned on every light. Sat in the living room until morning.

This morning, I went to the kitchen to make coffee and found a piece of paper tucked behind the cereal box. Ivy's drawing. Crayon on lined notebook paper. A stick figure girl stood in a square room. Beneath her feet, a black figure was drawn in a pit of jagged lines, reaching upward with arms too long for its body.

In the corner of the drawing was a sentence, written in shaky, childish letters:

“He said you shouldn’t have touched his door.”

I’m not sure if I’m more afraid that Ivy drew it.

Or that she [didn’t](http://www.youtube.com/@HauntHorizonHub).",22,1746383685.0,nosleep,0,0.97,False

But he kind of stayed around. He’s told me he wants to patch up. For the first 4 months we were very seldom in contact, he said he needed space. I got accustomed by time not having him around anymore. I needed to talk things through earlier and he wants to talk now. He wants the romantic relationship back. 

The thing is that i cannot get around to forgive him for how he handled things. Every time i even hear his voice on the phone i get triggered, feeling really mad, betrayed, stupid for believing that things would work out. I’m so extremely tired also. I met him yesterday in the city for coffee and since then I’ve been in a total rut. Like having sunken to a black pit with no way out. I see no point in anything. 

How long will it take to not get triggered? Will i ever learn to feel even neutral around him. He is at the moment the epiphany of all hell. I know he’s a good man and only wants the best but i get SO triggered. I’m like a walking joke of being engaged 3 times in my life and always dimpled because of my depression. I’m a fu**ing clown!

1keqtnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1keqtnr/new_to_enm_poly_and_struggling/,New to ENM / Poly and struggling,"Me (40M) and Wife (40F) we've been together for 17 years and just opened up our relationship around 5-6 months ago. We've been great a communicating and have met some great people in these last few months. Most of the experience has been very positive. We talk more, we've been going out on more dates together, and making time for ourselves away from our kids. All in all, I would say it's been a positive experience, but I still find I'm really struggling with how I'm feeling around certain situations.

I'm constantly communicating it (this is part of the problem) but it's getting to the point where she's now frustrated that nothing she can do will be good enough for me. I feel that I'm now in a situation where I'm driving her away more the more I try and communicate these feelings of mine. I know she loves me and wants to be with me but I'm really struggling here.

Basically, I get these feelings of being undesired by her or really anyone at the moment. Part of this is how she acts but a large part is that she has no problems finding partners, but I struggle to get people even matching with me or responding to my messages. I've had a few hookups but nothing serious and never a call back. She has proper dates with her partners. Coffee, dinner, movies at home, etc. She'll often be out for a few hours at a time. However, for me, it's 1-2 hours and out the door I go.

The other night, I tried to be intimate with her, and she said let's do it in the morning, which fair enough but then she wakes me up a few hours later, in the middle of the night to ask if she can slip out to hook up with a guy she just met. I was just lying there thinking, well what happened with us a few hours ago? When I question her on it, she got extremely upset. This happens time and time again. I try and set the mood during the day and shes not feeling it at night. Fair enough, that's life but then she gets one text from new guy and she's super excited and basically sprinting out the door.

Now, to be fair to her, these feelings of mine happen a lot so I understand her frustration with me. However, I do feel justified though, she'll go out with partners 2-3x a week and we'll have not been intimate more than once that week. This was the sort of frequency we had prior to going open so in her mind, nothing has changed between us.

I'm so torn because I've loved how much closer this has made us and I'm really loving watching her explore herself with these other people, but I can't help feel this way. We're closer than we've every been in all this time and I feel I'm doing a disservice to her.  It's driving her mad and I'm basically a nervous wreck every other day.

* What jobs/careers would fit my current skillset and experience 
* What sort of job could I get into today that will pay my bills
* How do I transfer into a job with little to no experience?
* How should I write my CV/resume? Do I ommit my previous experiences if they don't apply to the job I'm applying for?



I'm 28F from the state of Indiana. Since my first job at 14 I've jumped all over the place trying to figure out what sort of career and education I'd like to pursue long term. My resume and CV definitely represent that. I am a 2023 grad with a background in Art and Customer service. I want to transfer my skills into a professional career but I am unsure how to do that. I've always struggled to land an job that isnt working in a kitchen or customer service because that's all I've worked in. Now I'm struggling to find anything after leaving my last job not even Walmart will look at my application. I feel like I'm over qualified for a basic job but not experienced for a proper career. So I'm really at a loss of what to do.

I'm interested in something creative and structured full time. Being a regular artist full time does not interest me and I have considered things like Arts Administration and Visual Merchandising but again not sure where to start or what I'd be a good fit for. Going back to school isn't a problem and I'm open to relocation but would prefer to stay local. 


Experience
- I have mostly worked in kitchens and customer service roles for aprox 7yrs combined and 6 months as a retail associate at Walmart. One job was as a Dietary Cook for 3 months while I was stuck in another state. 
- last job was at 7 brew coffee

Education
- I have an Associates Degree in Fine Art.
- Culinary Courses incomplete degree
- Visual Communications Courses incomplete degree

1keqpri,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HelicopterWestern/comments/1keqpri/mormon_drinking_affairs_help/,Mormon. Drinking. Affairs. Help.,"I’m a Mormon who drinks (a lot) secretly and is having affairs with two separate women. I feel terribly. But I remain active in the church and even teach Gospel Doctrine and priesthood lessons when I’m asked. I lie about my worthiness to keep my temple recommend. At times, my cognitive dissonance is killing me.  I teach these great lessons and even feel the spirit.  Which doesn’t make sense with Mormon doctrine. People come up after and tell  me how much they love my lessons and how much it helps them in their lives. Especially how much they felt the spirit when I was speaking, justifying the truth of the points I was making. I’m not one of these people that hates the church. In contradistiction, I love the church. As well as my wonderful wife. In fact I feel it is better for me to keep all of my sins secret and spare my wife and my children the pain of my indiscretions. I would seriously rather go to hell than make them suffer. They actually think I’m a good person. Which obviously I’m not.  So, I live as if I’m totally active. For my wife sake, for my children’s sake, for my parents sake. I feel like I’m just completely hosed. I feel terribly. I’m at the point where I feel it would be better if I were not alive. But I’m not someone who would commit suicide so that’s really not a fear. I just feel badly. Both the girls that I’m cheating with have no issue with it. Anyway, just wondering what I should do. I’m stuck. Love my wife, love the church, love having sex with both of these girls who are 20 years younger than I. They are wild in bed. Never knew certain things were possible. They have no issue with the church. In fact both are members. Both love the church as well. Crazy situation. Can’t believe I’m here. I’ve been a bishop, dad’s been a mission president and temple president. I’m in deep. Probably should figure out an exit. Thoughts?  But one thing I’ll say. I’ve never drunk coffee:).

Like the title says, my dad called me fat on my birthday and told me I should start working on shedding the baby weight. I am writing in for any advice on how to talk to him about this. I am also sorry about the length. 

For a little background information: I (27f) and my husband (25m) welcomed our first baby this past June via C section. We are both full time music teachers, I teach high school choir at one of the biggest AA high schools in our state and he teaches elementary band at 7 elementary schools. Along with all of our concerts, choir tour, festivals, and all the rest of the stuff that comes with being a teacher we also teach private lessons on the side to help with the low pay of our jobs and the current state of our economy. So any spare time we have we make sure to spend it as a family with our son. 

Now to the title. I just celebrated my birthday yesterday and my dad was in town to help with our home renovations and to celebrate with us. On the morning of my birthday I was sitting enjoying a cup of coffee with my husband and son and opening gifts. No more than 5 minutes into the gift opening my dad comes in and sits down infront of us saying “bare with me, I need to break into dad mode for a second” and then goes off about his own weight. Haveing heard this many times before, he’s been insecure about his dad bod for as long as I can remember and constantly brings it up, I just nodded along. Until he starting talking about us. He would say things like “ya know I’m an old man that’s overweight but you two are young and over weight you’ll have an easier time loosing weight, you don’t want to be the heaviest in the family” I was FLOORED and had no clue how to even respond. Continuing on he goes “if we all just took the summer to focus on getting skinny we could all keep each other accountable” and then he turns to my husband and says “you know you’re just like me the family fluff” and then turns to me and says “and if you want to have more kids it’ll be much harder to shed off that baby weight.” At this point I was fighting back tears. I have always had an amazing relationship with my dad even with the constant weight comments, in High-school he would always say things like “if you just lost 5 more pounds you would be a perfect size.” Mind you I am just over 6’ and in High-school was at an unhealthy weight due to comments like this and severe body dysmorphia, but after years of therapy I was finally feeling comfortable in my body, especially after going through pregnancy and having a C-section. 
After his baby weight comment he digressed and said “I don’t mean to hurt feelings and your older sister told me to mind my own business but I have a preposition for you both, I’ll pay for you to go on weight watchers. Now you can either think on it and say yes or I’ll go back out the garage and you can tell me to fuck off behind my back. What ever works” and then he got up and left. Once he was out the door I started crying and my husband held me close. 
He did end up coming back in, seeing me cry, and apologized for hurting my feelings. 
Like I said previously I am very tall and have always felt I carried my weight pretty well, but with work and a baby I haven’t had a whole lot of time to work out but his comments still hurt. 

Here’s where I need advice. How do I approach telling him that his comments were uncalled for and I don’t want to be focusing so much on appearance for the sake of my son and his mental health as he gets older. I adore my dad and don’t want this conversation to be aggressive but I’m not great at setting boundaries. I grew up in a divorced family that avoided conflict and had terrible communication skills on both sides. So I’m still learning to communicate my feelings with my family. So any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1keqo92,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1keqo92/does_chulux_single_serve_coffee_maker_review/,Does CHULUX Single Serve Coffee Maker Review Prove It's Perfect for Small Spaces?,"The CHULUX LC-CM53807-BK Slim Single Serve Coffee Maker has been my go-to device in the past few weeks since I wanted to simplify my morning coffee routine. This portable coffee maker's matte black design instantly caught my eye. At first glance, the size seemed ideal for my small kitchen counter, and the lightweight build makes it perfect for moving around without hassle. Beyond design, I tested its efficiency to see whether it met the expectations set by its description. Trust me, this little coffee machine has some surprises.

**Compact Yet Effective Design**  
The sleek and slim design fits neatly on cramped counters, and as someone who hates bulky appliances, I can confirm that this compact coffee maker is a dream come true. Weighing only 2.6 pounds and with dimensions of 8.6""D x 3.9""W x 11.2""H, it takes up practically no space. It even accommodates travel mugs, which is a lifesaver when I’m rushing out the door. Its minimalist appearance, combined with matte black aesthetics, blends seamlessly with various kitchen styles.

**Advantages**  
- Compact and portable design suitable for offices, dorms, or RVs.  
- Compatible with K-cups and tea pods, catering to diverse preferences.  
- Auto shut-off ensures safety for the forgetful among us.  

**Ease of Operation and Simplicity**  
A single button for operation seems too good to be true, but in this case, it's not. One press, and the coffee brewing process begins, making it straightforward for anyone to use. There’s no overly complicated programming needed, which was a relief, considering that groggy mornings are not the right time to decipher a user manual. The setup includes preparing a pod, pouring water, and hitting the button. Within about three minutes, I had my hot coffee ready, piping fresh. That said, it’s not built for over 4,000 feet of altitude. A friend who lives in Denver reported inconsistent results, so that's something to note depending on where you live.

[Check CHULUX LC-CM53807-BK price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0ds4g48cq/)

**Coffee Customization for the Win**  
This machine supports everything from K-cups to tea pods, easily fitting mugs from 5 to 12 ounces, which works well for various preferences in my household. My partner has a penchant for black coffee, while I lean more toward flavored teas. Each time, the machine delivered the right brew with no extra hassle. The four-hole top needle ensures better water dispersion, which noticeably improved the flavor compared to other single-serve brewers that I've tried.

**Drawbacks**  
- Not functional at altitudes over 4,000 feet.  
- Lacks a large water reservoir for brewing multiple cups at once.  

**Maintenance Made Easy**  
Cleaning coffee machines has always been my least favorite task, but this one comes with convenience built in. The water reservoir and drip tray are removable, and with a mix of water and vinegar, plus a touch of the cleaning button, it was good as new. Having these detachable parts made a world of difference, especially because they’re dishwasher-friendly. As a person who loathes manual cleaning chores, I found this to be a genius feature.

**Competing Products**  
While exploring the market, I couldn’t resist checking out other single-serve brewers like the Keurig K-Mini and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. Both offer intriguing features, but here’s where the CHULUX coffee maker stands out. Unlike the Keurig K-Mini, this device includes an auto-shutoff feature, which is a massive plus for forgetful caffeine seekers. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew can brew ground coffee as well, which might appeal to purists. However, its bulky design tends to overwhelm smaller spaces, making the CHULUX ideal for compact areas. If you’re focused on portability and quick operation, the CHULUX reigns supreme.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering its features and capability, this coffee maker delivers outstanding value. It’s clear this isn’t a machine for coffee enthusiasts who savor the nuances of every grind and roast; instead, it’s an excellent option for people like me who want convenience without compromising too much on flavor. Given the additional functionality of supporting travel mugs and its lightweight construction, it’s hard to argue against its utility. During hectic days or while traveling, it gets the job done effectively without breaking the bank.

1keqnk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1keqnk7/could_chicco_ohlalà_twin_stroller_review_be_the/,Could Chicco Ohlalà Twin Stroller Review Be the Best Lightweight Option for Twins?,"Testing lightweight twin strollers is a task I dive into often, and Chicco 07079279410000 and the Chicco Ohlalà Twin Stroller recently rolled into my routine. If you're a parent juggling two little ones, you're probably curious if this stroller lives up to its promises. I took it for a spin—literally—and here’s an honest look at all its quirks and qualities.

**Impressive Design and Lightweight Build**  
The first thing I noticed while unpacking this twin stroller was its weight—or rather, how practically weightless it felt. Tipping the scale at just 8 kilograms, it's astonishingly light for a double stroller. Carrying it in and out of the car felt more like handling a carry-on suitcase than a stroller. Trust me, my toddler nephews weren’t this easy to lift! The sleek black design paired with an aluminum frame adds a modern touch, blending aesthetics with practicality. Despite its lightweight structure, the stroller feels sturdy and dependable. It was easy to see why it’s a favorite for parents managing twins or siblings close in age.  

**User-Friendly Folding Mechanism**  
Handling this stroller was a breeze, especially for someone like me who constantly multitasks. With a single hand, the stroller folds into a compact size (measuring 72 x 30 x 78 cm), making it fit snugly into tight car trunks or storage spaces. Better yet, it stands upright once folded. For anyone who's had their stroller collapse onto their legs (yes, that’s happened to me), this feature is a godsend! Highly valuable during those moments where one hand holds a shopping bag while the other is wrangling a restless toddler.  
[Check Chicco 07079279410000 price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b07yp34p45/)  

**Comfortable Features for Babies**  
A lightweight stroller often raises concerns about whether comfort will take a backseat. That’s far from the case here. This stroller boasts fully reclining seats, adjustable leg rests, and extendable hoods for both children. Each kid can enjoy their own configuration, allowing me to cater to my niece’s impromptu nap and my nephew’s desire to sit upright and observe the world. The extendable hood is a standout feature. Using an easy-to-conceal zip mechanism, the hood provided excellent coverage during a sunny park visit. Protection and style—what more could you ask for?

**Smooth Maneuvering and Driving Experience**  
When I took it on uneven sidewalks and through narrow store aisles, the agile handling did not disappoint. The unified handlebar simplified steering, even with just one hand. This made coffee runs infinitely easier. Trust me, trying to steer a clunky stroller while balancing a latte isn’t enjoyable! Its four-wheel design, crafted from a mix of plastic and rubber, glided smoothly, though it wasn’t as spectacularly shock-absorbent on cobblestones. To be fair, that’s typical for most strollers in this category.

**Highlighted Positives**  
During my testing, several apparent strengths of this stroller stood out:  
- Super lightweight and easy to lift, perfect for city-living parents.  
- Convenient one-hand folding ensures hassle-free storage.  
- Reclining seats and adjustable leg rests offer tailored comfort for each child.  
- Extendable hoods give top-notch weather protection.  

**Potential Drawbacks**  
On the flip side, there are areas where improvement wouldn’t hurt:  
- Limited suspension made bumpy terrain a little less fun for the kids.  
- Some might find the plastic wheels not ideal for off-road trips.  
- It doesn't come with extras like a cup holder or a larger storage basket, which are often handy for longer outings.  

**Competitive Options in the Market**  
Comparing this model to other twin strollers, its lightweight design truly makes it unique. Take, for example, the Joovy Scooter X2 Double Stroller. While the Joovy offers larger storage capacity and more robust wheels, it’s significantly heavier, making Chicco's option better for urban parents or frequent travelers. The Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 Double Stroller provides more all-terrain capability but comes at a heftier price (and weight). Chicco strikes an impressive balance in terms of affordability, portability, and comfort features.

**Affordable Quality Worth Considering**  
Discussing price points without diving into specific figures, I’ll say this stroller is quite the deal for what it offers. Those looking for affordable quality will appreciate the attention to practical features without compromising comfort. Its competitive price-to-quality ratio makes it particularly appealing if budget-friendly products don’t typically tick all your boxes.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsessions are the Terrifier and Smile series.  
  
Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions. Jamming out of a lot of 80's rock lately, as well.

1keqhye,https://i.redd.it/2r3ztxh24tye1.png,[Official] Introducing Spentrip - The travel expense tracker that works while you're having fun,"# Hey travelers of Reddit!

We're excited to launch this subreddit for Spentrip, a new app we've been working on that solves a problem we've all faced: trying to track expenses while traveling without ruining the actual experience of traveling.

We've all been there. You're exploring ancient ruins, tasting amazing street food, or lounging on a beach when you suddenly remember you should be tracking expenses. But who wants to pause their adventure to type in every coffee, museum ticket, or taxi ride? And when you get home? That stack of crumpled receipts in different currencies you promised yourself you'd sort through... yeah, we know how that ends.

Spentrip lets you capture expenses in seconds through AI-powered receipt scanning or just by speaking to your phone. No typing required. It handles all the currency conversions automatically and organizes everything by trip.

This isn't a repurposed business expense app. Spentrip is built specifically for leisure travelers (not expense reports), with categories that actually make sense for vacations and personal adventures.

We're just getting started, and we'd love to build this with input from fellow travelers. What features would make this most useful for your trips? Any pain points with expense tracking that we should focus on solving?

If you want to be among the first to try it out, comment below or DM us. We'll be giving away the Pro subscription for free for early adopters over the next few weeks.

Looking forward to building a community of travelers who want to enjoy their journeys without financial anxiety or post-trip receipt nightmares!

Happy travels,

1keqgng,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1keqgng,"my chemical romance in rockin'on buzz, october 2006 / summer sonic tokyo","review:

I rushed into the arena for My Chemical Romance, and found the front of the stage to be extremely crowded, humid, and hot. I looked up at the new band logo and was moved. Then, as the band appeared and suddenly played “I’m Not Okay”, I nearly fainted and was pushed out of the circular mosh pit, but somehow managed to hold on.

My Chem’s second time at Summer Sonic was a rare stage appearance, coming just after they had finished their long-awaited new album. And as symbolised by Gerard’s dazzling blond hair, they loudly proclaimed the beginning of a new chapter. Mikey, the bassist, who has taken off his glasses and looks more manly, moved fiercely around like a different person, while Frank the guitarist seemed to concentrate on his playing more than usual. Ray’s guitar sounded sharper, and Bob’s drums roared with his long bangs blowing in the wind.

Two new songs were performed that day, the first of which was “Dead”, a dance-inducing number with a riff reminiscent of the first album’s “Headfirst For Halos” (Gerard's comical movements were also great). “House Of Wolves”, following the same beat as the first song, felt like a new frontier with its glamorous and dramatic development like a musical. I enjoyed the bliss of listening to a new song live for the first time, fully activating every cell in my body to take in the melody and lyrics that I will continue to listen to and sing tens of thousands of times in the future.

After explaining that he’d decided to quit drugs after Summer Sonic two years ago and was grateful to come back clean, Gerard said, “*Arigato*.”Despite injuring his leg while shooting a new music video, he ran from one end of the stage to the other to speak to the audience.

The sound they played, reborn and standing on the Summer Sonic stage again, was full of confidence and pride. That’s why “The Ghost of You” was such a grand song that had so many people waving their hands from side ot side, and “The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You”, which was performed live for the first time in Japan, caused a wave of simultaneous jumps and shook the stadium. And when the last song, “Helena,” ended and the whole venue responded with screams to Gerard’s words, “Sing it as loud as you can to reach the heavens!”, my heart was beating so fast that I couldn't wait to see the new world that My Chemical Romance will show me. 

post-interview notes:

Even though Gerard and Bob had injured their legs while filming their latest music video, *My Chem* still came to Japan and showed up how much they've grown. They looked like they were in pain at times as they went through the minute-by-minute filming and interviews, but when the camera was pointed at them they smiled like this (impressed). Mikey liked the canned coffee so much he drank two cans in one go, saying, ""This is so good! And strong! Why don't they have this in America!"" We asked them about their powerful new work and got a real glimpse of how close the five of them are in the November issue of Rockin'on!",5,1746382586.0,MyChemicalRomance,1,0.86,False

I was told to post this over here by the /cancer mods since they said they try to keep it just for patients. I vented my soul and didn't want it to have it lost. You can read what I posted but last night I had a rough night and just needed to get it out of my system.

After spending four days in the hospital hallway, they didn't want to give us a room since they kept thinking we were leaving soon than later and then another one of her oncology team wanted another scan ect. I never left her side, sat there in dirty closes and eating nothing but vending machine coffee for days.

My wife was diagnosed with stage 4 renal carcinoma about six years ago which she has been fighing hard to keep at bay. Last night we found out she has large tumor behind her left eye and a few leisions in her brain (the cancer is in every organ and her bones too now.)  She has developed aphasia because one of the tumours is just touching the speech center in her brain. The spot is so small they find it hard to believe it could be affecting her speech but she didn't decide to get aphasia for fun, it hits her more so when she's tired and its hard for her to get the words out. They are in her brain they just won't come out right from her mouth.

After six years of fighting this she has been given 3 to 6 months. I don't even why I am writing this out. I guess I just feel lost. She is my life, everything I have done over the past 17 years of us being together was to make her happy. I am 47 (she is 51) and my brain can't process the thought of not having her around. She got very sick about three weeks ago (first case of aphasia and lost 80% of her strength over night) but before that other than her weak leg and having to use a cane you wouldnt know she was sick.

I told my boss I have to leave and stay by her side until the end. He understood and told me there is a place waiting for me when I'm I want to come back. Not that I wouldn't  bankrupt myself to get one more hour with her. Money is going to be tight but I only need enough to get her though this and then I no longer need to worry. I don't even think i will survive her passing. My heart is already weak and to be honest I wouldn't mind at all if I passed away at the exact same time she did. That way I can go looking for her in whatever comes next.

What is getting me is all I can think about is wanting to switch places with her. I can't get the thought out of my mind. She is the most amazing woman in the universe and she doesnt deserve this. I want it to be me..I would give anything for it to be me.

Anyways I just needed to get this out. I love her so much and those people that keep telling me to just put her in a hospice center and keep going with my life are pissing me off. She made me promise years that I wouldn't take her to a hospital to die. She wanted to pass at home when the time comes and not only will I keep that promise I will stop anyone that tries to take her away from her home.

At the hospital the doctors kept saying I could go home and they would call me as they found out more. I hated going down the hallway to go to bathroom and leave her alone for two minutes.

Again I am sorry for making this so long or even typing it out to begin with but I need to do something..I have slept maybe 30 hours total in the last three weeks and my brain won't relax..So it probably doesnt even make sense.

Thank you for being here to let me vent my soul. For anyone else out there going through this I am with you and for cancer patients out there never stop fighting. My wife was told five years max, we are halfway through year six and she is still here. So never stop fighting, after watching my wife fight this and taking to other cancer patients I have to say that people with cancer seem to have a strength I wish I had even a tiny bit of. Some of the strongest people in the world you people are and I hope all of you find a way to beat thing evil monster. It's taken enough from us all already.

Edit: Just wanted to thank you all for your support. I love all of you and if anyone is going through the same thing as me or as a patient feel free to contact me. I believe cancer makes us all part of a special family and anything I can do to help you please let me know.",38,1746382491.0,CaregiverSupport,10,1.0,False
