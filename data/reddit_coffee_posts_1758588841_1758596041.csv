I started university for like a month. I am not kinda guy who easily likes someone. But somehow... I started to like her. Maybe it sounds unbelievable but it is the first time in my life that I felt someone enough to show on acts. I didn't know what to do. She was introvert, and I was introvert too. On the first week, I just find and texted her insta. We talked a little. She doesn't use insta much, so she always late replied. Yea.. already obvious that she isn't interested in me... I know. But what I have to lose? Second week, I bought her a coffee and bring to the class and gave her (I was literally shaking). I still remember her reaction... so cute. Then next week, after I texted her insta and she didn't reply for a few days, I decided to ask her number. I saw her on a cafe sitting alone, so I approached, we talked for like... half a minute. And yea.. she gave me her number. And that day... I texted her something like that ""Since you are not really into texting I wanna ask if it is okay for you if we meet up one day to chat"" And she just asked if I am interested in her... I said yes. And she kinda rejected me. But she didn't tell ""I don't like you."" It was something like that ""You are a sweet personality, but it is possible that I leave this university soon. So I prefer not to build so much friendships.""

So... the thing is that. It means one day if she decides to stay here.. we will still have a chance... or she was just trying to be nice while rejecting me?

There is one more thing... she hide her stories from me on insta after that chat. I don't know why she did that. What can her intention even be?

I currently have the Breville dual boiler and am loving the coffee. Mailnly drink milky coffees. My issue is the grinder is so inconsistent (breville grinder in the duo pack it came with) and that the whole family uses the machine and there is constant mess around after grinding and frothing.  I‚Äôm so over it, I have 9 people in the house and I just want to be able to enjoy my morning coffee hassle free.  The question is, should I upgrade to the oracle dual boiler which I believe is an all in one and allows for the family to have their own profile, should I opt for a fully automatic one touch machine that grinds, tamps, pours and does milk with nothing left for me to do, or should I upgrade my grinder and keep my current machine for my own setup and get the rest of the family a separate setup?  I was even considering something cheaper along the lines of a delonghi or Nespresso pod machine with milk option.  I might add the others in the family are not the most patient and delicate at handling my machines hence my reason for wanting to change things up. They‚Äôre all tradies and get up super early and are almost still half asleep  t make coffee. If I‚Äôm up then I‚Äôll make it but if not then it‚Äôs either no coffee or messy coffee, especially due to the grinder being inconsistent and the 3 step process!  
I should also mention that I like my coffee extra hot and medium roasts, I find fully automatic machines just don‚Äôt produce hot enough coffee and well, the flavour is obviously not as good as a regular machine i had a saeco 
I am open to any suggestions or ideas. I was also thinking about getting a whole new setup for myself along the lines of good grinder and machine. If a breville oracle dual boiler costs around 5000 au then I‚Äôd rather spend that on better different banded machines like emc, profitec. Thoughts please.

1no6170,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1no6170,Is the BSA audit really worth it?,"I work as HSK for hotels that are brands purchased by Marriott, one of them recently acquired. The internal management of workers and budgets is kept up to date and many times the brand promise cannot be fulfilled due to monetary issues of the owners rather than the worker. But when we have inspections, the auditors are extremely strict, and penalties arise. In my last BSA we got 70 points in cleaning just for having exposed metal on one of the chairs, since it had a part about 1 cm rusty, also the lack of 1 amenity since we did not have a suit protector at that time due to logistics issues from the corporate supplier and the carpet did not pass the white towel test (our hotel only does 2 carpet washes a year for budget reasons, and not 6 as the BSA requires), although it never found any hair on us; ratings in service and f&b we get 100 respectively 
I recently vacationed at 2 Marriott Corporate hotels, and was very surprised to find that they were worse than mine, including threadbare, worn linens, showers with scale and splattered walls, dirty window frames, small hairs between the mattress protector and sheet, and dusty furniture.
The second Marriott hotel I stayed at (Saturday, September 22) didn't even have a coffee maker (when I put the water in, it started to leak through the base and I had to dial twice in 90 minutes), the hand cream had a tab, the floor wasn't swept, and not to mention the gray dust and heavy lint in the closet. They had a BSA audit 2 days ago (my partner is also a hotelier and he found out that the front desk manager was an old college friend) and they boasted that they had a 98 rating.
You can imagine what a shock it was for me to see so many problems in the room and service even with that rating.
So, well, I don't know why there is a difference in ratings between one audit and another, even if it is Marriott.

Pessoal, estou aqui para apresentar o meu projeto, minha pequena contribui√ß√£o para o mundo da pirataria.

O nome √© Cinemoon, um site onde voc√™ pode assistir filmes, s√©ries e animes gratuitamente.

Basicamente, assim como a maioria dos sites de filmes piratas, o Cinemoon √© um indexador, ele indexa o conte√∫do de CDNs externas e lida com as informa√ß√µes das produ√ß√µes atrav√©s dos seus respectivos IDs IMDB e TMDB.

O Cinemoon possui uma automa√ß√£o que roda no servidor em conjunto com o site, adicionando, automaticamente, novas produ√ß√µes.

Futuramente, queremos adicionar mais funcionalidades ao site, e trazer interatividade, como sistema de avaliac√£o interna, coment√°rios, favoritos e playlists.

Voc√™ pode exportar todos os IDs (IMDB e TMDB) contidos na base de dados, a opc√£o de exporta√ß√£o est√° acima do Header.

Colocamos tamb√©m uma op√ß√£o de doa√ß√£o, pelo Buy Me a Coffee. Caso queira enviar alguma quantia, para ajudar com a estrutura ou s√≥ incentivar a continuarmos com o projeto e aprimor√°-lo, seremos gratos!

i'd sit in the cafeteria eating my donuts and having a coffee with whatever local newspaper was available because i don't think i'd gotten into sudoku yet.  i'd look for any local events for the day or near future and do puzzles or whatever.  i remember seeing once that there was a cat show at a facility that was about a block away from the mall and it was going on in a few hours.

this facility had a skating rink, too, and that was another place i'd kill time throughout the day or sit in to watch practice.  i was never asked to leave and it's a public building so... why not.  i'd just hang out, maybe mess around on my phone, read if i had anything interesting going at the time, listen to music.  it wasn't my favourite place to be, but i did go there now and then.  anyway, the cat show was in the basement.

i'd been a little concerned i wouldn't be able to find this section of the basement even though it's not that big a building, but by the time i reached the bottom of the staircase, all i had to do was follow the sound of meowing.  there was *a lot* of meowing, like, way more and way louder than i expected.  i love cats, so this was great.  i don't remember every specific cat that caught my eye but there was this one who reminded me a lot of my cat oscar because he just *knew* he was the shit.  you could see it on his little face.  no doubt in his mind.  he was sitting in his... i guess you'd call it a cage, but it would be more like 'suite' or 'penthouse' like '*jealous?*'

i saw a bit of the judging but have to say these people were *really* serious about their cats and there seemed to be a bit of an etiquette, which i broke a few times.  i felt revealed as a non-cat shower, got a little uncomfortable and left.",11,1758594984.0,BenignExistence,0,1.0,False

Me (42F), husband (43M), 2 kids (ages 7 and 9) 

Sex was decent when dating- not the best I‚Äôve ever had but enough. I married him because I knew he‚Äôd be a good provider, a good father, stable, he makes me laugh, he is a good human and I feel in love with him and all of that. He is a sweetheart. I felt like I finally found a normal partner (my relationships prior were full of fire in the bedroom but also tumultuous). 

The sex dwindled during the first few years after becoming parents- I was nursing and exhausted- he traveled all of the time for work. It didn‚Äôt register. About a year or so after kid 2 was born, I started to notice that he was peck kissing me, tight lipped- and I asked ‚Äúwhy do you kiss me like that?‚Äù.  No reply. 

It all continued to go downhill. When we did have sex (super infrequent) - he couldn‚Äôt keep it up. When he could keep it up, he finished and left to go wash off and left me hanging in the bedroom to finish off myself. I would ask him to get involved and he did so without more intercourse and truly it felt like out of obligation and a chore. I‚Äôd get off thanks to my own doing but I always felt so undesired. 

I urged him to see his doc about ED. He did and the doc said ‚Äútry a healthier lifestyle and if that doesn‚Äôt work, we will talk again‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt follow thru much on the healthier lifestyle and the sex continued to dwindle. He would initiate in the middle of the night in a dark room- I told him he was a ‚Äúsleep sexer‚Äù. It was weird! 

I found porn on his phone of a woman masturbating in public- I said I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre watching porn without me while you won‚Äôt have sex with me. I asked if that is what he was into ‚Äî I said if that‚Äôs it for you- why don‚Äôt you share it with me so we can do stuff together? It was if he was embarrassed. He never brought it up again. 

Over the last 4 years, I‚Äôve suggested pills, toys, therapy. He has not responded to any of these ideas. 

At one point, in an extremely rare vulnerable moment on his part (after attempted sex and ED), he shed a mere tear (he is very emotionally unavailable) and said ‚Äúthis has happened before in a prior relationship. I think something happened to me when young and I have blocked it out‚Äù I think he was implying sexual abuse but he didn‚Äôt come out and say it. I was extremely supportive and held him and I said you can get help to overcome this. This was years ago, I‚Äôve been in therapy on my own for over 2 years and constantly share how it‚Äôs helped me in so many ways. I  have reminded him to start therapy multiple times, I‚Äôve emailed him links to therapists, etc. he recently told me he wasn‚Äôt investing his time in therapy bc he was investing it in something completely unrelated (a medical issue he wants to get under control). I was devastated bc it shows me that he is actively choosing NOT to go to therapy‚Äî he should focus on the medical issue but can‚Äôt someone do two things at once? 

There have been several instances where I have just angrily blown up at him ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you have sex with me!!!??‚Äù. I‚Äôve asked him 2x if he was gay. He didn‚Äôt answer that question and he never really talks to me about it - it‚Äôs me just talking to him and he says nothing. We clearly have a communication breakdown. But it‚Äôs not from me, I have tried each and every way to communicate- it was soft and gentle at first, then I was pissed and now I‚Äôve checked out. 

At night now, after kids are sleeping, I just stay downstairs and watch TV while he falls asleep alone. This has been happening for at least a year now most nights. He doesn‚Äôt join. Sometimes, we do watch a show together and laugh at the show in bed. we do the obligatory hug and peck upon leaving and greeting but that‚Äôs about it. 

I accidentally had somewhat of an emotional affair with a guy friend - nothing physical and it was brief- but the dude started calling me all the time and saying really fun and subtly flirting things to me. He would call and I‚Äôd literally walk right out of the room laughing that I was in with my husband to talk to this guy. That guy just kind of filled my cup for a bit - don‚Äôt talk to him anymore- but it was interesting bc my husband never got jealous or said a peep! I was like how does he not see that I‚Äôm having a little flirting! 

If I get dressed up, husband will say you look nice. He brings me flowers on special occasions. He brings me coffee. We maintain a solid partnership and we‚Äôre good parents. It‚Äôs just straight up Dead bedroom hard core. I‚Äôm sad for him and me both because a life without that intimacy and fulfilling sex- well it sucks. 

But at this point, I feel like he‚Äôs lost me in that regard. After years of this neglect and him not taking any action after all of my attempts at communication‚Äî I can‚Äôt imagine myself being able to ‚Äúgo there‚Äù with him again. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt look at him the same. I‚Äôve even verbalized to him that our relationship now just feels platonic (I got no response to that one, either, literally no feedback) 

I wish it wasn‚Äôt the case bc I really don‚Äôt want a divorce for soooo many reasons - too many to list. 

I‚Äôve explored discussions of poly, ENM, and open relationships in therapy. All of them sound wonderful because I‚Äôd get what I crave in some sort of situationship ‚Äî but for the life of me, I can‚Äôt imagine have that conversation with him if we can‚Äôt even properly discuss our own dysfunction, ya know? 

I also don‚Äôt even know if I have the spoons to bring it back up to him YET AGAIN. How many times does one person have to beg to be seen?! 

So here I am, at a loss how to move forward, in my prime HL, before the dreaded menopause I‚Äôve heard wrecks havoc on a woman‚Äôs Libido, I feel like I need to do something soon or else this is just something I have to accept but I fear it will eat me alive, as it already has been. 

If you‚Äôve read this far, thanks. I just needed to get it all out.

The jingle of my alarm dragged me out of a shallow, restless sleep. I sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing the heaviness from my eyes before shuffling toward the bathroom. Cold water splashed over my face, sharp and bracing, chasing away the last traces of fatigue. I gazed at my reflection In the mirror, a faint shadow of stubble crept along my jaw. Brown eyes half-lidded, and my blonde hair stood in electrified disarray.

After scarfing down a banana for breakfast, my phone buzzed. Right on time, I thought, pressing it to my ear.

‚ÄúHey, sleepyhead,‚Äù came a familiar singsong voice, dripping with sarcasm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm outside. You ready to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, just about,‚Äù I replied, my voice still heavy with sleep. ‚ÄúJust need to grab my bag‚ÄîI‚Äôll be down in five.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem, bud,‚Äù the voice shot back, teasing as always.

I couldn‚Äôt help but crack a smile as I hung up. I grabbed my hiking bag, gave it a quick once-over to make sure nothing was missing, then slung it on my back, locked the door, and headed outside.

James was waiting on the curb in his Tacoma. As I approached the truck, I noticed an open can of Monster Energy sitting in the cupholder. Knowing him, he‚Äôd already drained half of it.

‚ÄúHey there young man,‚Äù James called with a wicked grin as I got closer. ‚ÄúHow much do you charge for an hour?‚Äù

After tossing my bag in the back and climbing into the passenger seat, I smirked and shot back, ‚ÄúFuck off.‚Äù

Satisfied, we began the long four-hour drive to the Sunshine Coast Trail.

I was born and raised in British Columbia, Canada. The Pacific Northwest has always been my home‚Äîa place of towering evergreens, mist curling through the valleys, and the kind of crisp, resin-scented air that clears your lungs with every breath. For as long as I can remember, those deep woodland greens have given me comfort.

It wasn‚Äôt until a few years ago, though, that I began to explore the land more deliberately. Hiking started small: modest 6 km (3.7 mile) trails, the kind you can finish in a morning and still be home in time for lunch. Gradually, my ambitions stretched farther. I found myself drawn to more demanding treks, and each year, I raised the stakes a little higher. Each trail left me hungry for the next. This trip was no exception.

The longest trail in Canada, Winding Snake trail stretches a whopping 180 km (112 miles), winding through a remarkable variety of landscapes‚Äîancient rainforests thick with moss, rugged alpine ridges, quiet coastlines, and hushed streams tucked into shadowed valleys. What sets this trail apart is its hut-to-hut system. Scattered along the route are roughly sixteen backcountry huts, each offering weary hikers a roof and a place to rest before continuing their journey. It was mid September, where the weather was just starting to cool, and summer relented to fall.

The goal was to complete the hike in ten days. It should have gone off without a hitch‚Äî*should have been* the key word.

The Tacoma rumbled onto the highway, its tires drumming a steady rhythm against the asphalt. Morning light spilled through the windshield in golden bands, flickering as we passed stands of evergreens. The city fell away behind us, its concrete and noise replaced by winding roads, mist-hung valleys, and the occasional glimpse of ocean winking silver through the trees.

We rolled the windows down, letting the air rush in‚Äîcool and damp, carrying the faint tang of salt from the coast. James nursed his drink, one hand on the wheel, while I leaned back against the seat, letting the hum of the engine and the blur of passing scenery pull me into a quiet calm.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs Kelly?‚Äù I asked after a few moments of comfortable silence.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs great!‚Äù James lit up instantly, his voice warm and unguarded. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still figuring out when to hold the wedding. And she‚Äôs only a year away from finishing her master‚Äôs in engineering. I swear, man, she‚Äôs the smartest person on the planet.‚Äù

I could hear the pride in his voice, and I was genuinely happy for him. Still, a flicker of envy stirred in my chest. He was engaged; I was still single. He owned his apartment, I rented mine.

I know they say comparison is the thief of joy, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself. James had always seemed a step ahead. In the last couple of years, I could feel him drifting further from me, which is part of why I leapt at the chance to do this long-ass hike together.

He moved to BC from Newfoundland when he was seven. On his first day of elementary school, I saw him sitting alone, absorbed in a set of plastic dinosaurs. I walked over, asked if the T-Rex could beat the Triceratops, and just like that, we hit it off. Nearly twenty years later, we‚Äôre still best friends.

At 6‚Äô3 and nearly 230 pounds, James was hard to miss. A true Newfoundlander through and through, with thick brown hair covering most of his body and a beard that seemed to grow faster than he could shave, he looked less like a man and more like some wild thing dragged in from the woods. Though he had grown a bit of a paunch in recent years, a near decade of playing rugby ensured his cardio was on par, if not better, then mine.

The rest of the drive passed in an easy blur. James and I talked about everything and nothing‚Äîthe newest video games, ridiculous animal facts, half-baked political takes. The conversation wandered without direction, the way it always did, but that was the comfort of it. With James, nothing was ever off the table.

About an hour from the trailhead, we rolled into a lonely gas station off the highway. The neon sign buzzed faintly in the morning haze, promising fuel, coffee, and sugar in equal measure.

‚ÄúWant anything?‚Äù I asked as I unbuckled my seatbelt.

‚ÄúAnother Monster and some beef jerky would be great,‚Äù James said.

I snorted. ‚ÄúWith a diet like yours, how are you still alive?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt even blink. ‚ÄúSpite.‚Äù

I shook my head and pushed open the door while James stayed behind to fill up the truck. Inside, the air smelled faintly of burnt coffee and cleaning solution. I grabbed a Monster, jerky, a couple protein bars, candy, and two muffins, piling them into my arms before dropping everything onto the counter.

The cashier looked ancient, her face a map of deep lines, her thinning gray hair twisted into a bun at the back of her head. She moved slowly, methodically, scanning each item one at a time. While she worked, I let my eyes wander. Behind her, tacked to the wall, was a cluttered community board, its surface crowded with fading flyers and curling papers. One of them caught my eye‚Äîa missing-person poster, tacked crookedly to the corkboard. Unlike the faded garage-sale ads and yellowing church notices, this one looked fresh, the paper still crisp, the ink dark. Two faces stared back at me.

¬†One was a man, he looked to be in his early fifties, shaggy black hair streaked with gray and stuffed beneath a baseball cap. The photo had been snapped mid-laugh, probably at some game‚Äîhis wide grin a frozen moment of joy.

Beside him was a younger boy, maybe eighteen. His photo seemed more candid, taken at a beach. Shirtless, slightly pudgy, his ghost-pale skin stood out against the sunlit backdrop, a sharp contrast to his shoulder-length black hair that clung damply to his neck. His eyes were wide, unguarded, brimming with an innocence that felt almost out of place against the somber context of the poster.

Beneath their photos, bold block letters read:

**MISSING**  
Ronald Varg (52) and son, David Varg (18).  
Last seen: July, traveling Winding Snake trail  
If you have any information, please contact‚Äî

‚ÄúSuch a shame,‚Äù came a withered feminine voice, jolting me out of my thoughts.

I looked up. The cashier had paused mid-scan, her wrinkled hands hovering over the register. ‚ÄúThey came in here a couple months ago,‚Äù she said, shaking her head slowly. ‚ÄúSeemed like such nice folks. Damn shame about that bear attack.‚Äù

My eyes narrowed, refocusing on her. ‚ÄúYou think a bear got them?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they‚Äôre saying.‚Äù She leaned forward slightly, as if letting me in on a secret. ‚ÄúThey found their camp about three-quarters of the way up the trail. Tent ripped wide open‚Äîhuge hole in the side. Bits of bone, clothing, dried blood‚Ä¶ scattered all over the place, but no bodies.‚Äù

There was a strange lilt to her tone, a spark of excitement threading through the horror. Out here, I guessed, stories like this were currency. Company was rare, and tragedy‚Äîeven second-hand‚Äîwas something to talk about.

She straightened up, shaking her head again. ‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt a bear,‚Äù she said, her voice trailing off into something almost gleeful, ‚Äúthen I don‚Äôt know what could‚Äôve done that kind of damage.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll keep my eyes peeled‚Äù I said with a half-hearted chuckle, eager to steer us away from the topic.

The old woman gave me a knowing nod, her expression unreadable. She slid the last muffin across the scanner, the machine beeping sharply in the quiet store. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be twenty-six seventy-eight,‚Äù she said.

I pulled a couple crumpled bills from my wallet, trading it for a thin paper bag that sagged under the weight of caffeine and sugar. The cashier handed me my change with papery fingers, her eyes lingering on me just a moment too long, as if she wanted to say more but thought better of it.

‚ÄúHave a good hike,‚Äù she finally said, the words carrying a weight that felt more like warning than farewell.

As I stepped back into the morning light, James was just sliding the fuel hose into its holster. He noticed me coming and lifted his brows in a quick, wordless greeting.

‚ÄúGot everything?‚Äù he asked once I tossed the bag of food onto the back seat.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, shutting the door. I then told him about the cashier, the missing persons poster, and her story of the shredded campsite halfway up the trail. As I spoke, James kept his eyes on the road, his usual smirk fading into a more thoughtful line.

When I finished, he let out a long breath through his nose, then glanced at me, one hand tightening slightly on the wheel. ‚ÄúSounds like a hell of a way to go, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

The rest of the drive we tried to outdo each other with tales of the worst ways to die‚Äîbeing eaten alive by swarms of insects, or slowly flayed, or boiled alive. Each story got darker, more grotesque as the truck groaned into the parking lot outside the trail head.

James hopped out of the truck and began rummaging through his bag.  
‚ÄúTwo seconds, buddy,‚Äù he muttered, digging around with the focus of a man who had buried treasure in there. ‚ÄúPromised I‚Äôd give the old battleaxe a call when we got to the trailhead.‚Äù

With a small grunt of triumph, he pulled out a satellite phone. It wasn‚Äôt anything fancy‚Äîscuffed casing, bulky antenna, the kind of tech built for utility, not looks. He began thumbing the buttons before stepping a few paces away for reception.

James stepped a few paces away, holding the bulky satellite phone like it was some sacred relic. He jabbed at a few buttons, waited, then spoke, his voice low and clipped so I couldn‚Äôt make out every word.

‚ÄúWhat are you wearing?‚Äù he growled, a shit eating grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. ‚ÄúYup, all good so far, no issues. Yep‚Ä¶ yep, we‚Äôve got the food, the gear‚Ä¶ everything‚Äôs set.‚Äù He paused, listening, then nodded. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry babe, we‚Äôll check in every couple day. Love you too.‚Äù

He ended the call, sliding the phone back into his bag with a satisfied nod.

I watched him, noting the faint tension in his shoulders as he exhaled. It was the kind of precaution that reminded me we weren‚Äôt just heading into a normal hike. Out here, the wilderness had its own rules. Then we set off.

When planning a long, multi-day hike, every ounce counts. Too much weight on your back and every step becomes a slog. James and I had tried to plan for everything, weighing each item against its necessity.

My pack was a carefully curated collection of essentials: food‚Äîmostly canned, dried, smoked, or bagged goods like trail mix, oatmeal, and candy‚Äîwater bottles, a couple changes of clothes, lightweight tent, sleeping bag, flashlight, first aid kit, small hatchet, can opener, and bug spray, and a water filter bladder.

It was a simple yet brilliant design: fill the bladder with water, hang it from a tree, connect the tube to your bottle, and in ten or fifteen minutes, you had clean, safe drinking water. The thing was almost magical in its simplicity, a little slice of civilization in the middle of the wild.

James‚Äôs pack told a different story. Where mine was organized and precise, his seemed to reflect his personality: big, bulky, a little chaotic, but somehow perfectly functional. He had his own food stash‚Äîenergy bars, beef jerky, a half-empty bag of chips he insisted ‚Äúwas essential‚Äù‚Äî lightweight lantern, a small cooking skillet, and a sleeping bag stuffed into a compression sack that looked like it had seen better days.

Despite the differences, it worked. Our packs balanced out in weight, and more importantly, they reflected the balance between us‚Äîmy meticulous caution, his laid-back confidence. Together, we were ready to take on the trail.

The first couple of days passed uneventfully, almost peacefully. Birdsong drifted down from high in the canopy, bright and melodic, though the moss-draped branches often kept the singers out of sight. Sunlight spilled through the leaves in shifting patterns, warming patches of the trail while leaving others in cool shadow. More than once, we lost the path‚Äîthe trailhead wasn‚Äôt always obvious‚Äîand had to double back to find it. The dense trees made navigation tricky, every direction blending into the next. I could easily imagine a less experienced hiker getting hopelessly turned around out here. The air carried the earthy scent of damp soil and pine, grounding us in the steady rhythm of the hike. The miles piled up beneath our boots, and we felt like we were making solid progress.

On the third day, James and I sat on a downed log for a quick water break when his eyes lit up suddenly.  
‚ÄúOh! I completely forgot to show you something,‚Äù he said, nearly bouncing with excitement. Digging into his bag like a kid on Christmas morning, he pulled out a flare gun.

‚ÄúWhere the hell did you get that?‚Äù I asked, a grin spreading across my face.

‚ÄúCabela‚Äôs,‚Äù he admitted almost sheepishly, like it was some guilty indulgence.

The thing was hard to miss: a bright blood-red barrel, a polished brown stock, and a hammer painted a glaring shade of yellow.

James cradled it carefully in both hands, his grin never fading. ‚ÄúAlready loaded,‚Äù he said, as if reading my thoughts. ‚ÄúFor emergencies.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat safe?‚Äù I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat if it goes off in your bag?‚Äù

He shrugged casually. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll probably burst into flames,‚Äù he said, deadpan.

I blinked at him, torn between being horrified and amused. ‚ÄúAlrighty then,‚Äù I muttered, shaking my head with a crooked smile.

James just laughed and tucked the flare gun back into his pack like it was the most ordinary thing in the world. Around us, the forest remained hushed and indifferent, as if it hadn‚Äôt heard a word. We hoisted our packs and set off down the trail once more.

Each day we covered roughly thirty kilometres, our legs aching but our spirits buoyed by the sheer beauty around us. Streams tumbled across the path, their water crystal clear, and we often stopped to fill the water filter, then fill the bottles. By the end of the 5th day, our progress had brought us to Elk Lake Hut. Nestled beside the still, reflective waters of the lake, the hut looked even smaller and more inviting after the long hours of walking. The lake mirrored the surrounding peaks and trees, creating a perfect, almost surreal frame around the simple wooden structure.

We dropped our packs with a collective sigh of relief, the tension of the trail momentarily slipping from our shoulders. For a moment, all that existed was the gentle lapping of the water, the croaking of frogs, the rustle of leaves in the breeze, and the quiet satisfaction of making it this far. Elk Lake Hut would be our home for the night, a small sanctuary in the heart of the wilderness before we pushed onward.

The inside it was simple, but it carried a rugged charm. The walls were raw timber, their knots and grains catching the light like scars in old skin. On the far wall, a small wood-burning stove squatted on a metal plate, its surface blackened from years of use. A half-empty box of matches and a bent fire poker lay on top. Along two walls were wooden bunks, one next to the other. Each was fitted with a thin foam pad, the kind that made sleep possible but never luxurious. Carved initials, dates, and little messages were scrawled into the wood next to the beds‚Äîtestaments to the people who had passed through before. *‚Äú2017 ‚Äì Mike was here‚Äù* sat beside *‚ÄúCold as hell but worth it‚Äù*, and beneath that, a crudely drawn moose.

The windows were streaked with dirt and condensation, but through it you could catch the glimmer of water, still and dark under the fading light.

‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù I muttered, more to myself than to James, running my hand along the rough timber wall. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we start a fire in the stove and have ourselves a cooked meal?‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good to me,‚Äù James replied without hesitation, his stomach giving a dramatic growl at the mention of food. He smirked, patting his gut. ‚ÄúIf you wanna chop up some wood, I‚Äôll cook it up. First, though, I gotta call my girl.‚Äù

I wandered toward the treeline, scanning for dry sticks, while James ambled down toward a small dock that jutted out over the pond. The dock was old‚Äîboards gray and splintering, nailed together more with stubbornness than integrity. I watched him idly from the corner of my eye as I hacked at a branch, the sharp crack of wood splitting filling the still air. James pressed the phone to his ear and started pacing the dock, muttering something under his breath, probably waiting for a signal.

Then it happened. Without warning, one of the boards gave way with a sickening crack. His leg plunged straight through the rotten timber.

‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù James bellowed, lurching sideways. The satellite phone flew out of his grip, arcing just long enough for both of us to realize what was happening before it splashed into the dark water below.

‚ÄúShit!‚Äù I dropped the sticks and sprinted toward him, but James had already wrenched his leg free with a savage tug. Before I could tell him to leave it, he leapt straight into the pond after the phone.

The water came up to his chest, sending ripples racing across the surface. He froze for a second, sucking in a huge breath, then plunged his head and shoulders under. Bubbles foamed up where he disappeared.

Seconds later, he erupted from the water, gasping and sputtering, hair plastered to his face. In one dripping fist, he held the satellite phone triumphantly above his head like some absurd prize.

‚ÄúGot it!‚Äù he croaked between coughs, water streaming from his beard and clothes.

‚ÄúYou good, man?‚Äù I asked, trying‚Äîand failing‚Äîto stifle the laugh bubbling up in my throat.

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm good,‚Äù James grumbled, dragging himself out of the pond, boots squelching in the mud. He held the dripping satellite phone like it had personally betrayed him. ‚ÄúBut I think this thing is fucked. Waste of three hundred bucks.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me handle dinner tonight,‚Äù I said, trying to soften the sting of his embarrassment. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any rice to put it in, but I do have oatmeal. Maybe it‚Äôll suffice?‚Äù

James barked out a laugh, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYeah, maybe. Worth a shot.‚Äù He sloshed past me toward the hut, leaving a trail of muddy footprints. I clapped him on the back as he went, his wet clothes squishing with every step, and he gave me a sheepish grin before disappearing inside.

I turned back to the dock, hatchet still dangling loosely in my hand. That‚Äôs when I froze.

Across the pond, half-hidden in the trees and the fading light, a figure was watching us.

It stood unnaturally still, its skin pale as bleached paper, like it hadn‚Äôt seen sunlight in years. From where I stood, the distance blurred its features into something unsettling‚Äîlike a face you know is human but can‚Äôt quite recognize. My stomach tightened, a cold ripple running through me.

The figure then turned abruptly, vanishing into the dense treeline with a hurried shuffle.

I stood there for a long moment, the forest suddenly too quiet. The ripples on the pond smoothed into glass. Only the distant call of a raven broke the silence.

I got the fire going in the stove, occasionally using the fire poker to shift the brung wood, ¬†the first lights of flame crackling to life before spreading into a steady warmth that filled the tiny shelter. James had stripped down to his underwear, his wet clothes draped on a nearby chair in front of the stove, Hopefully, it wouldn‚Äôt be long till the fabric dried. He sat slouched on one of the bunks, the battered satellite phone in his hands, poking at it with the kind of stubbornness only born from pure frustration.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to be so pissed,‚Äù James muttered. ‚ÄúShe probably thinks I was attacked by Bigfoot or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good way to go,‚Äù I teased, stirring a can of pork and beans on the stove until the edges bubbled. ‚ÄúRipped apart by a mystical beast. Beats dying of old age.‚Äù

James snorted but didn‚Äôt look up. I poured a portion into a dented tin bowl and handed it to him. He accepted it with a grumble of thanks before digging in.

‚ÄúLeave it in the oatmeal for a couple days, might do the trick,‚Äù I said, half-joking, half-serious, nodding toward the phone.

James gave me a sidelong glance. ‚ÄúOatmeal resurrection, huh? Worth a shot.‚Äù

I cracked the stove door open, tossed another stick onto the fire, and listened to the wood snap and hiss. The hut was warm now, almost cozy, but my eyes kept flicking back toward the window‚Äîout into the darkening trees where the pale figure had been.

Later that night, after we‚Äôd eaten and James had finally given up on the phone, it lay in a baggy of oatmeal next to his cot. We lay in our bunks listening to the stove‚Äôs steady crackle. Sleep came slow.

Somewhere outside, a twig snapped.

My eyes snapped open and for a long moment, nothing followed. Then came the rustle of underbrush, circling the hut. I held my breath, straining to hear, heart thumping so loud I swore it would wake James. A low creak groaned against the outer wall, like something brushing past the logs. I lay still in my bed, still as a corpse. Eyes glued on the window on the other side of the hut.

Then slowly, impossibly, a pale face appeared at the glass.

It wasn‚Äôt sudden‚Äîit eased into view, like someone pressing forward out of the shadows. The skin was chalk white, almost glowing against the black of the forest behind it. No visible hair, but large sunken eyes stared into the shelter.

It didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt blink.

It looked unreal, like something pasted onto the night itself. My body screamed to wake James, to shout, to run, but all I could do was stare. Then, slowly, the face drifted away from the window.

And did something worse.

The door rattled. Someone‚Äî*something*‚Äîwas trying to get in.

That broke me. I tore free of the sleeping bag, hatchet in one hand, flashlight in the other. My voice cracked the silence: ‚ÄúJames! Wake up!‚Äù

James jolted upright with a snort, confused, as I charged the door like a madman. I wrenched the lock free and threw it open, the beam of my flashlight cutting through the dark. James stumbled up beside me, still wearing nothing but his boxers, wielding the fire poker in one hand, lantern in the other, looking like a half-asleep caveman. ‚ÄúJesus, man,‚Äù he muttered, rubbing his face. ‚ÄúWhat the *fuck* are you doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe door,‚Äù I hissed, pointing at it with the hatchet. ‚ÄúSomeone tried to open the door. I saw‚Äî‚Äù My words faltered, my chest tightening. How could I even explain what that face looked like? It didn‚Äôt feel human.

James squinted into the trees, holding up the lantern in front of him, unimpressed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see shit. Probably a raccoon or something.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. My grip on the flashlight trembled, the circle of light jittering across the treeline.

Then, faint‚Äîso faint I almost thought I imagined it‚Äîcame the sound of *something* retreating deeper into the woods. Not the four-legged scramble of an animal. Two feet, crunching over leaves.

I didn‚Äôt sleep much the rest of the night. Every crack, every creak, every branch scratching against the hut‚Äôs walls set my nerves on edge. My eyes remained glued to the window, waiting for the visitor to return.

‚ÄúDamn it!‚Äù I woke with a start. Beams of morning light were bleeding in through the windows. James sat on his bed, satellite phone in hand, frown etched across his face.

‚ÄúCome on, you piece of shit, work!‚Äù he muttered, glancing in my direction.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ morning,‚Äù he added distractedly, not noticing my tension. ‚ÄúSleep okay?‚Äù

I tried, and failed, to shake the last vestiges of sleep from my head. ‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I admitted, rubbing my eyes.

I nodded toward the satellite phone. ‚ÄúStill not working, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope. Might need to be put more in the oatmeal,‚Äù he muttered, glancing up at me with a hard look. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ going to talk about last night?‚Äù

Heat rose to my face. Embarrassment hit hard, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt let it slide. If I stayed quiet, I‚Äôd look like a lunatic.

‚ÄúLook, man,‚Äù I said with a heavy sigh, running a hand through my hair, something I did when stressed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy. I saw something.‚Äù

James stared at me skeptically, eyes locked on mine, searching for any sign that this was some elaborate prank at his expense. After a long beat, he nodded. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ so what was it you saw?‚Äù

I hesitated; grateful he was at least listening. ‚ÄúNot exactly sure,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúBut it was‚Ä¶ skinny. Pale.‚Äù

James cracked a wicked grin. ‚ÄúVery original.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious, dude,‚Äù I snapped, irritation starting to flare.

James wiggled his fingers at me and pulled a ridiculous face. ‚ÄúIt was Slenderman, huh?‚Äù

I threw my hands in the air. ‚ÄúI know how crazy it sounds‚ÄîI‚Äôm not making this shit up.‚Äù

James put a finger to his ear, mimicking a microphone, and in a mock-reporter voice said, ‚ÄúThis just in: local hikers found fucked to death by clich√© monster.‚Äù

I groaned, running a hand over my face. ‚ÄúYou *do* realize this isn‚Äôt funny, right?‚Äù

James shrugged and leaned back against the wall, still smirking

I just roll my eyes, ‚Äúwhatever dude, lets just get going‚Äù and began gathering up my belongings.

The next couple of kilometers were slow and exhausting. Not only was I sleep-deprived, but every few feet I found myself glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see that pale figure lurking behind the trees. Each time, there was nothing‚Äîjust the swaying of branches and the occasional rustle of unseen wildlife.

By the time the sun was beginning to tilt toward the horizon, around 5 p.m., we were still eight or nine kilometers shy of the next hut. My muscles ached, my pack felt heavier than ever, I really didn‚Äôt want to sleep outside after last nights encounter.

¬†Unfortunately, it looked like we didn‚Äôt have a choice. We set up camp and made do with a simple dinner of protein bars and ketchup chips. Later, we played cards under the weak glow of the lantern. James gloated with every win, his laughter echoing faintly in the stillness, but my mind was elsewhere.

As the shadows stretched long and thick around our small campsite, a creeping unease settled over me. The forest, which had seemed quiet and familiar all day, now felt alive with unseen eyes. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, sent a shiver crawling up my spine. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of being watched.

‚ÄúAre you going to be okay?‚Äù James asked, genuine.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ yeah, I think so,‚Äù I replied, though the tremor in my voice betrayed my unease.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hitting the hay. If you get eaten alive by this monster, try not to scream too loud‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want my beauty sleep interrupted,‚Äù he joked, lightly jabbing me in the arm.

I forced a weak smile, but my eyes drifted to the dark forest surrounding us. The shadows seemed alive, the trees shifting just enough to suggest movement. It felt like the eyes were everywhere, watching my every move, waiting for a moment of weakness to strike. My guard felt impossibly thin, and the night stretched out ahead like a living thing. I slipped into my sleeping bag, trying to convince myself I was just being paranoid. The forest outside seemed still, but every so often a branch would crack, a leaf would scrape against another, and my pulse would spike. James‚Äô even breathing soon reminded me that he had already dozed off. I envied him, or at least the illusion of peace he seemed to have. I tried to close my eyes, to block out the feeling of eyes pressing in from the darkness.

A few sleepless hours later, the urge to piss became impossible to ignore. I tried to push it down, telling myself to wait, not wanting to step outside into the dark, watching woods. But it was a losing battle.

I muttered a curse under my breath and quietly unzipped my tent flap. Heart thudding, I peeked out, sweeping the flashlight beam across the forest. Shadows stretched and twisted, but nothing moved.

The waning gibbous moon sagged in the sky like a bruised eye, its swollen face leaking pale light across the forest. The glow wasn‚Äôt comforting‚Äîit was sickly, strained, as though the moon itself were wasting away. Shadows stretched long and crooked under its watch, twisting the trees into warped silhouettes. Every patch of silver light felt like exposure, like being dragged under its gaze, while the darkness between seemed to crawl closer, eager to swallow what the moon abandoned.

Slowly, I stepped out of the safety of my tent, every nerve on edge, and moved to relieve myself, ears straining for the slightest sound. The forest felt impossibly still, yet every instinct screamed that I wasn‚Äôt truly alone. After I finished, I turned to head back to my tent‚Äîand froze. The beam of my flashlight caught it, partially hidden behind a tree. Its bald head tilted slightly, pale and wide eyed, staring straight at me.

‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù I shouted, the flashlight shaking in my hands. My grip tightened around the hatchet, every muscle coiled, ready to charge if it stepped closer. The forest seemed to hold its breath, the usual night sounds fading into an unnatural silence.

I could feel my pulse hammering in my ears, each heartbeat a deafening drum. The figure didn‚Äôt move‚Äîjust watched, impossibly still, as if assessing whether I was a threat.

Then, a bony hand emerged from behind the tree, followed by a weak, quivering voice: ‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm lost.‚Äù

If I hadn‚Äôt just gone, I probably would have soiled myself right then.

By now, James was emerging from his tent, lantern in hand, rubbing sleep from his eyes. His gaze fell on the figure, and he staggered back in terror. ‚ÄúFucking hell!‚Äù he screamed. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt hurt me,‚Äù the creature said, its voice fragile. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen another person in so long‚Ä¶ please. I mean you no harm.‚Äù

My pulse still racing, I forced myself to take a step forward. Summoning every ounce of courage, I shouted, ‚ÄúCome out where we can see you!‚Äù

Ever so slowly, it emerged from behind the tree, pale features fully revealed, its movements deliberate and cautious. It looked like a walking skeleton, skin stretched taut over bone, caked in dirt and mud. Its body was completely hairless‚Äîno hair on its head, face, or body, not even eyebrows. like¬†Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs infamous character, the Judge, if he was liberated from Auschwitz.

I noticed, uncomfortably, that it had no clothes, leaving its thin, frail form fully exposed. The sight made my stomach churn, but I forced myself to focus, trying to understand whether it truly meant any harm. ‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ who are you?‚Äù I asked, voice steadier than I felt.

It gestured to itself, long, bony fingers curling awkwardly, and rasped. ‚ÄúMy name‚Ä¶ is David Varg,‚Äù",1,1758594826.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

so she does, and basically my sister's mad because she does everything for me and i ""can't sacrifice my time to do the same thing in return"". 

for extra context, my sister for some reason doesn't want to do things on her own, it's always been like this since i was younger. each time she went to the store i HAD to go with her or else she was going to be upset with me. I had hoped this would all dissolve, but it didn't. there was this time where she wanted to go to a fashion show, i declined as i'm not into that. she keeps insisting and she says ""i already bought us tickets"". the day of the event, i'm clearly unhappy to be there and she says, ""well you could've just said no, i would've went by myself."" 

this has been an ongoing issue, and i've always feared of upsetting her or giving pushback because it 100% always results in her getting angry and pulling away. it's literally just us two and we have nobody else to depend on.

so when i confronted her about all the things she's done for me, she brings up the times where she had to drive me places (all places in which she volunteered on driving to). there was this time where she suggested for us to go painting at the library, and i asked her multiple times, ""are you sure you want to?"" to which she responded ""yeah i like painting!""

we even had to reschedule the painting event and i insisted we really didn't need to go, but she wanted to. even after the painting event she suggested for us to buy some to continue it.

now today, she apparently didn't even want to go painting and only did it for me.

she held the fact over my head that she pays for the bills, subscriptions, and my wisdom tooth surgery, which are all things i have asked on multiple occassions to pay for, and called me selfish for not bothering to go out with her, despite us being around each other 24/7.

and when i brought up how she gives the cold shoulder when she's mad at me? denied it completely. said it was me who does it, despite me having to say ""hi"" to her every time i see her, despite me letting her know when i'm leaving the house, despite me literally going to her room every single night to say goodnight and that i love her.

she also had an noncancerous fibroid surgery, which she decided to cancel because she ""has no support system"". i don't know why she's risking her own health over something like this.

Background: I've never worked in an office. My previous job was in high volume, fast paced restaurants. I have a great home office set up (desk, two monitors, lots of plants). 

I'm open to ideas! I work for a great company and my boss is 10/10. I want to improve and don't want to lose my job in the process. Thanks!

Chapter 5

UNS Enterprise, SCV-02

Mars Patrol Orbit, 0159Z

Nyla Serrin dreamed of flying. She felt space moving around her like water. She reached out the window of her fighter to feel the stars move between her fingers, which was both not at all strange and surreal at the same time. Her dark hair streamed behind her while meteoroids flickered by. She spiraled around a comet, watching as its icy skin vaporized under the sun‚Äôs radiation and streamed away with the solar wind.

But Nyla couldn‚Äôt help but wonder why she felt a pull towards something else as if she was being called. She felt her awareness shift. She was asleep and needed to wake up!¬†

‚ÄúRabbit,‚Äù a lilting musical voice called. ‚ÄúRabbit get up. There‚Äôs an emergency.‚Äù

‚ÄúLieutenant Commander!‚Äù The voice said more urgently.

Bon! That was Bon, perky, urgent, and unflappable. She only came online like that in an emergency! Nyla snapped awake. The emergency alarm in her quarters was going off and the emergency lights flashed red, an all hands scramble.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm awake, Bon,‚Äù Nyla said.

‚ÄúRabbit!‚Äù Bon‚Äôs chipper voice said from the combrace charging on her night table. Her fighter VI was only allowed to communicate like this in emergency situations.

Nyla grabbed the com brace and locked it onto her wrist with a practiced flick of her arm. An earpiece popped out and she fit it into her right ear.

‚Äú<Talk to me, Bon,‚Äù Nyla said in French. ‚Äú<What‚Äôs happening?>‚Äù

The VI responded in French, ‚Äú<Enterprise is at condition 2 on shade orange posture.>‚Äù

‚ÄúMerde!‚Äù Nyla muttered. She grabbed her shipsuit from a hook and slammed her legs into it. Her mind already raced. Ghost and Darth were on leave. They‚Äôd be under-strength. Fiend and Fanboy would have to fly together.

‚ÄúBon, give me a sitrep.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Rabbit. Fleet reports a Corporate Alliance raid at¬† Perseus station. Enterprise is tasked to go to emergency warp and provide interdiction and support to station defense.‚Äù

She finished zipping up her suit and raced to the hatch, smashing the button with her fist to open it. The corridor outside burst with frantic activity as other flight officers and squadron leaders were moving. Nyla glanced up to see that most of her Viper squadron were still in their quarters.

She moved quick-march down the corridor slamming her fist against the hatches of their quarters.

‚ÄúMove it, Vipers! Move! Move! Move! I want you suited up in five minutes! Get your asses out of bed! Let‚Äôs go! Go! Go!‚Äù

She stood at the ready as doors opened and her flight officers began rushing out. Some still zipping up their shipsuits. Only Speeddemon and Prancer were left with a green light above their hatch.

Nyla pounded on their hatch. In any other situation, the sight of mocha-skinned Frenchwoman barely over 1.6 meters tall pounding on a door might have engendered comedy. With Nyla, it was pure terror for the targets of her ire.

‚ÄúSpeeddemon! Prancer! Get your lazy asses moving! Now!‚Äù

She had learned that command voice from her first squadron CO after flight school. Commander Price‚Äôs callsign might have been ‚ÄúSparkles‚Äù but everything about her had been harder than hullmetal armor.

The hatch hissed open, and the two slugabed pilots loped out, fully dressed, but looking sheepish.

‚ÄúSorry, boss,‚Äù Speeddemon, the shorter of the two said. Americans! Though that wasn‚Äôt quite fair since Ghost was from America as well, and he typically beat her in sims. Speeddemon though? He was Nyla‚Äôs constant problem, and Ironmonger had placed him on counseling more than once.¬†

‚ÄúLater,‚Äù Nyla replied ominously, ‚ÄúMove now! Asses in cockpits.‚Äù¬†

She pushed them forward and all three ran down the corridor towards the readyroom. In addition the Voidvipers, the Sunrakers, and the Guardians were locking into their flightsuits.¬†

Nyla ran to her locked and pulled out the vac liner,¬† tugging the seal over one leg when Bon piped in. The VI used her briefing cadence, that measured, slightly quicker rhythm when dumping operational data.¬†

‚ÄúRabbit, Tag forwarded the initial contact package from Ops. Initial report is of two Falcon-class cruiser-carriers and 30 fighters, a mix of S-3 Siroccos and SF-1 Mantises.¬† Inbound with missile cruiser support.‚Äù

Nyla dragged the liner over her hips, chest plate snapping into place. She glanced at her CO, Ironmonger, as he sealed his vac suit.

‚ÄúBoss, we cover station defense?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect. CAG is tasking us and the Sunrakers with CSP around Perseus with dual objectives, intercept inbound fighters, then break to missile interdiction before they breach the five-hundred-klick defense perimeter.‚Äù

Nyla stepped into the rigid vac boots, locking them with a twist, then slid her arms into the suit‚Äôs sleeves. The shoulder patch, the Void Vipers serpent of starlight, caught the flashing red emergency lights as she pulled the neck ring into place.¬†

‚ÄúBoss, with Ghost and Darth on leave, recommend pairing Viper 4 and Viper 7 as a flight and Viper 5 with Viper 8. They should balance each other.‚Äù Nyla said she grabbed her helmet, almost knocking over a mug with faded letters spelling out raktajino an humanoid figure with a ridged forehead holding a coffee mug up in the air..

‚ÄúCopy that, Rabbit,‚Äù her CO replied without hesitation. ‚ÄúMake it happen.‚Äù

Ironmonger then spoke into his com.

‚ÄúTag? Did you get that? Brief the CAG‚Äôs VI on the adjustments.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood. Vipers, you heard it,‚Äù she called over the ready room din. ‚ÄúFour with Seven, Five with Eight. Brief your wingmates en route. Launch order holds as posted. Move.‚Äù

The deck plates shuddered beneath her boots as Enterprise‚Äôs RCS arrays and mains pushed into a coordinated burn, slewing the carrier onto its warp translation vector. The deep vibration rolled up through the bulkheads, followed by the subtle tug of the inertial compensators trimming the last of the maneuver.

Bon‚Äôs voice was brisk in her ear. ‚ÄúRabbit, Ops projects twenty-six minutes to Perseus intercept. Enemy force profile unchanged: two Falcon-class cruiser-carriers, three missile cruisers, thirty fighters. FleetSim probability: primary target is likely the rare earths facility.‚Äù

Nyla snapped her vac collar into place. ‚ÄúCopy. Push that to all flights.‚Äù

She then keyed a button on her vac suit cuff to bring up the squadron channel.

‚ÄúVipers. We will be going in hot on arrival.‚Äù

A chorus of ‚Äúcopy that‚Äù followed as Nyla fell into a quick jog toward the hangar, helmet tucked under one arm.¬†

At the hatch to the hangar passage, a battered sheet of cardboard hung overhead, *SHUTTLE BAY 1* scrawled in thick black marker and held up with strips of silver duct tape. A prominent curvy delta was doodled in one corner, the logo of an old sci-fi universe. The sign had been there longer than she had been on board; no one admitted to putting it up, and no one dared take it down. Every crew member passing through reached up and tapped it, a habit so ingrained that even in full scramble, hands went up automatically. Nyla‚Äôs fingertips brushed the edge without slowing. Superstition or not, you didn‚Äôt skip the tap.

Beyond the reinforced hatchway, the hangar‚Äôs fighter bays were already alive with motion. It smelled of coolant, warm metal, and ozone, the scents that meant launch crews were working at full tilt. Deck crews swarmed over the SSF-4 Phoenixes used by the Voidvipers, Sunrakers, and Guardians. Ordnance crews ran mag-trams hauling missile pallets in tight formation. Nyla was nearly bowled over by a mag-tram humming past with chaff pods.

The 1MC barked overhead.¬†

‚ÄúFlight decks prepare for launch. All personnel clear launch tubes. Repeat, clear launch tubes.‚Äù

That meant Enterprise would be pivoting to her warp insertion trajectory. Starship combat operations dictated that Enterprise warp in and launch fighters under chaff cover, and then power the EM shielding to combat levels. Even in a fighter with hardened electronics, the flux from passing through shields at combat strength could play merry hell with the systems on-board or force a shutdown to keep them from shorting out. All it took was spending a few milliseconds too long inside the field. The hardening was supposed to prevent it but the smallest flaw would energize the whole fighter.

Nyla leapt across the markings for the ordnance crews trams and starting running towards her fighter. Most of the other pilots were as well. She heard yelling behind her as a mag tram nearly slammed into a pilot with his situational awareness turned off. A quick glance told her it wasn‚Äôt a Sunraker or Voidviper, so it wasn‚Äôt her problem to solve, though she imagined a complaint would go up the chain and back down the squadrons to ‚Äòbe mindful of surroundings in the hangars.‚Äô

Nyla stepped into her fighter‚Äôs bay, the angular black armor of the Phoenix gleaming under the overhead work lights. The keel winglets were folded and retracted at the moment to allow it to be stationed safely with keel locked to the deck. The launch crew was already there, loading fuel and ammunition, as Nyla back her own preflight inspection. She walked around the 35-meter fuselage, checking her railguns and missile launch bays and moving after to her fusion engine and making sure there were no obvious issues with the external plasma collimators. If worse came to worst, they could always cut open an enemy ship, though that was incredibly risky.

Her boots rang on the deck as she stepped up tp the ladder. Mardie in her orange crew chief ship suit walked over..

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs she looking ma‚Äôam?‚Äù

Nyla smiled.

‚ÄúLooking five-by-five, Mardie. Anything I should know?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo ma‚Äôam. She‚Äôs green across the board.‚Äù

Mardie held out her hands.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll hold your helmet and hand it to you when you get in.‚Äù

‚ÄúMercie,‚Äù Nyla said as she handed it over before she grabbed onto the ascent ladder and hauled herself up it. She swung herself over the lip of the cockpit and settled into her seat. Mardie grabbed a rung and partially pulled herself up enough to hand over helmet.

‚ÄúGood hunting, Commander!‚Äù

‚ÄúMerci, mon ami.‚Äù¬†

Mardie gave her a two-finger salute that Nyla returned before the crew chief dropped back down out of sight.

Nyla slid her helmet down and it locked with a faint hiss.¬† Her suit began the systems-link handshake with Bon and the fighter. Icons rippled across her HUD with status bars¬† blooming green in a neat cascade down the left edge of her view.

The cockpit itself came alive as indicators and manual controls booted up. Bon came in over the helmet‚Äôs com.

‚ÄúRabbit, your loadout is standard strike-intercept,‚Äù Bon reported. ‚ÄúFour AM-9B Foxdart fighter-intercept missiles, two AM-21 Optimus multi-role missiles, full chaff, EMPs, and flare. Guns hot with tungsten-sleeved depleted uranium penetrators, EM-reactive sabot. Railgun capacitors charged.‚Äù

The penetrators weren‚Äôt just dense slugs, each sabot carried a micro-battery and EM sensor. If the round‚Äôs nose detected a hostile shield‚Äôs magnetic signature,¬† split-second later, the tungsten sleeve would pop, letting the bare uranium core slip through the deflection field. Against unshielded targets, the sabot stayed intact for maximum punch.

‚ÄúCopy that, Bon. Prep us for hot zone launch.‚Äù

Nyla flipped the controls to close her canopy. The mag locks sealing her in engaged with a thump. The rumor was that test pilots refused to fly Phoenix tests until the engineers added that feature. Functionally, it was unnecessary but pilots were pilots and wanted to ‚Äòknow‚Äô the system was on. It definitely made Nyla feel better to hear it.

A pair of deck crew in yellow shipsuits moved into position, datapads clipped to their forearms. One crouched at her starboard engine cowling, another plugged a lead into the auxiliary systems port.

‚ÄúFusion check,‚Äù Nyla called into her sideband channel.

‚ÄúPrimary, green,‚Äù the tech replied, giving the starboard intake a final tap before stepping back.

‚ÄúSystems reactor check,‚Äù Nyla continued.

‚ÄúAux green,‚Äù came the quick answer from the port-side tech.

Mardie‚Äôs voice came through the com.

‚ÄúAll clear for cockpit depress.‚Äù

That was the last step. If power systems weren‚Äôt nominal, you didn‚Äôt move to cockpit depressurization. The vac suit life support needed power. No power means no oxygen or cooling. No power means no weapons or thrust.

‚ÄúCopy that chief,‚Äù Nyla replied, ‚ÄúRunning depress.‚Äù

She flipped the switches that started pumping air out of the cockpit. Doctrine dictated that fighters go into combat with the cockpit at a fraction of standard pressure. Cockpit glass was a special meta material that could resist most glancing blows but if it was penetrated, a sudden and violent depressurization would create an uncontrollable and unknown delta-v, deadly in combat. Low pressure allowed for less rigid vac suits and was easier on the cockpit systems.

‚ÄúVoid Vipers, radio check,‚Äù Nyla called on squadron net.

‚ÄúViper-3, Fiend. Five by five.‚Äù

‚ÄúViper-5, Speeddemon. Five by five.‚Äù

‚ÄúViper-6, Fanboy. Clear.‚Äù

‚ÄúViper-7, Juliet. Five by five.‚Äù

‚ÄúViper-8, Make. Clear.‚Äù

‚ÄúViper-9, Prancer. Clear.‚Äù

She keyed her command channel. ‚ÄúViper-2 to Viper-1 ‚Äî Void Vipers are green across the board.‚Äù

Ironmonger‚Äôs reply was instant, calm but edged with anticipation.

‚ÄúCopy that Two. Stand by for strike pack upload.‚Äù

Her HUD lit with the CAG‚Äôs tactical overlay, Ironmonger‚Äôs loadout profile dropping into Bon‚Äôs control space: coordinated intercept vectors, missile salvo timing, and priority target tags. The Phoenix‚Äôs targeting banks digested the data in seconds, shifting amber icons to red kill markers.

‚ÄúStrike pack received,‚Äù Bon confirmed. ‚ÄúFire control synchronized to squadron network. Engagement rules in place.‚Äù

Mardie came on the line. ‚ÄúCockpit pressure stable at combat-low,‚Äù she said into her comm circuit. Bon echoed it on her HUD. The air in the Phoenix was down to a thin whisper, enough for the electronics operations and suit cooling, but not enough to give her a dangerous delta-v from outgassing if the canopy got holed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre slated for launch tube four, commander. You are go on your copy,‚Äù Mardie said over the maintenance channel.

‚ÄúCopy, Launch Four,‚Äù Nyla said. ‚ÄúAll greens from the cockpit.‚Äù

The chief gave Nyla two thumbs up, the all-clear, and waved her forward. The HUD lit up with the taxi path to the launch tube. Nyla eased the flight stick forward and began moving along the track in her HUD using the fighter‚Äôs mag lifts.

Someone had put a sign above tube four: insert tab a into slot b at your own risk. Nyla shook her head. Someone more important than her would see that soon and make it come down. She guided her fighter onto the loading platform and disengaged her mag lifts.

The com came alive with the launch crew.

‚ÄúGood morning Viper-2. Confirm status.‚Äù The voice was far too happy for it being so early.

‚ÄúMarko, that you?‚Äù Nyla asked.

‚ÄúRight in one, commander.‚Äù

Nyla shook her head. ‚ÄúSystems green.‚Äù

‚ÄúConfirm green. Load pad engaging.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy. Locking wings to launch position.‚Äù Nyla pulled the levers that would unfold and extend the bottom winglets. The launch tube used all four to help accelerate the fighter. Hot launches were the worst since it used a mich higher acceleration. The magnetic fields of the launcher, the ship grav, and fighter compensators would interfere with each other sometimes. It wasn‚Äôt unusual to come back with broken ribs.

‚ÄúConfirm launch configuration. Reactors reading green. Life support green. Mag seals green. Viper-2 is green for load,‚Äù Marko said.

The shudder moved through the fighter as it loaded into the launcher. Inside, hydraulic clamps locked onto the fuselage hardpoints while umbilicals snaked into place for final data sync and fuel top-off.

‚ÄúMag-field collar charged,‚Äù a different launch tech reported over the tube channel.  


‚ÄúLauncher rails hot,‚Äù came another voice.  


‚ÄúSafety interlocks green,‚Äù a third chimed in.

‚ÄúViper-2 locked and loaded. Awaiting launch command,‚Äù Marko said.

The Phoenix sat locked in the launch tube, inertial dampers making the cockpit vibrate faintly. Nyla‚Äôs HUD showed everything green, reactor temps stable, weapons armed, mag-collar holding.¬†

And nothing happened.

It had been nearly 10 minutes since Nyla‚Äôs fighter had been loaded into the tube.

It had been eight minutes since Bon had said, ‚ÄúTranslation expected in ninety seconds.‚Äù¬†

Nyla flexed her fingers on the stick, eyes flicking to the squadron net. The Void Vipers were silent except for the occasional status check, short, clipped, no one wasting words. Somewhere down the line, she caught the faint hiss of someone exhaling hard over an open mic.

The minutes dragged. Her suit‚Äôs cooling system cycled again, loud in the stillness. She shifted in her seat, checked her weapons queue, glanced at the launch indicators. Still nothing.

Finally, Ironmonger‚Äôs voice came up on the squadron net.¬†

‚ÄúAll Vipers, standby for CAG.‚Äù

The carrier wing frequency opened, and the CAG‚Äôs voice filled it.¬†

‚ÄúAll flights, secure from launch posture. This was an unscheduled readiness drill, part of FleetCom‚Äôs Tier-2 evaluation. Good work holding readiness in the tube. Power down weapons and return to maintenance bays. CAG out.‚Äù

The channel clicked silent.

In Nyla‚Äôs ear, Bon said, ‚ÄúRabbit, confirming standdown orders and return to bay.‚Äù

On the squadron net, someone muttered a profanity in three languages. Groans and sarcastic chuckles followed, the sound of adrenaline venting into pure annoyance.

More loudly, someone said, ‚ÄúThis has been a test of the emergency fuck-you system. If this had been a real emergency‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ironmonger‚Äôs voice cut in, sharp and clipped.

¬†‚ÄúCut the chatter, Viper-7.‚Äù¬†

The weight behind it was enough to shut the channel down to silence in a heartbeat.

Nyla kept her voice level. ‚ÄúViper-2 copies. Securing weapons. Cycling reactors.‚Äù¬†

She flipped the safeties on, watched HUD icons fade from green to amber. Her helmet vibrated slightly as the cockpit repressurized.

Nyla wanted to swear just as loudly as the others. Unscheduled or not, FleetCom could have run the sim without keeping them stewing in the tubes like loaded rounds in a rack. But XO or not, she was still on an open channel. Discipline first, grumbling later.

The launch tube‚Äôs clamps re-engaged with a dull thunk, and Nyla‚Äôs Phoenix unloaded from the tube. She flipped the switches to refold her keel winglets and the load lift deposited her fighter back on the deck.

The helmet HUD gave her the path back, and she began the slow rollback toward her fighter bay. The tension bled away, leaving only the sharp taste of disappointment.

As the Phoenix settled into the maintenance cradle, Nyla ran the final shutdowns.¬†

‚ÄúMain and aux reactors to wind down. Weapons cold,‚Äù she called out.

The cockpit canopy hissed as it unlocked, lifting away on its actuator arms.

Nyla popped the seals on her helmet and pulled it off in one smooth motion. The recycled air of the hangar hit her face, cooler, still carrying the tang of coolant and ozone. Without the helmet‚Äôs weight and the constant feed of the HUD, she felt the tension in her neck and shoulders all at once.

Her pulse was still high, a leftover from the surge of going from dead sleep to full combat alert in minutes. The readiness drill,¬† unscheduled, deliberately strung out, had left her with the hollow, drained feeling of adrenaline burning off. She took a slow breath, pushing it down, keeping her face neutral as the ladder clanged against her fuselage and a crew chief climbed up.

‚ÄúWelcome back, Commander,‚Äù Mardie said with a wry half-smile.

Nyla just nodded, handing down her helmet. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get her turned around,‚Äù she said, voice steady even though every part of her wanted to pace, shout, or both. There‚Äôd be time to burn off the frustration later. For now, XO discipline came first.

Hi Reddit! I‚Äôm starting a build-in-public journey for my new project, **Momentum by** [**MojoNation.AI**](http://MojoNation.AI) ‚Äî an all-in-one AI-powered superapp designed to help people turn ideas into action, gain clarity, and stay productive across every part of life.

It all started in **Ipoh, the City of Millionaires**, over a cup of the famous white coffee. I realized that I wasn‚Äôt alone: we all have half-finished notes, scattered thoughts, and voice memos that never turn into anything meaningful. The problem isn‚Äôt ideas ‚Äî it‚Äôs turning them into action.

üí° That‚Äôs when the spark hit: what if AI could take messy notes and turn them into structured, clear, actionable content instantly?

This is Day 1 of sharing the journey publicly. My goal: build a **superapp that helps creators, entrepreneurs, and teams** hit **RM1M ARR**, and create an ecosystem for other AI startups ‚Äî from classroom to boardroom.

Follow along as I share **daily updates, wins, struggles, and lessons learned** while building Momentum by [MojoNation.AI](http://MojoNation.AI) from the ground up.

Would love feedback, ideas, or just encouragement from fellow Redditors ‚Äî and if you‚Äôve ever struggled to turn your ideas into action, this is for you!

These uniquely structured pouches are designed to stand out on shelves and perform just as well during the filling process. For businesses and brands looking to upgrade their packaging, understanding the key advantages of this style is essential.

One of the most impressive benefits of side gusset pouches is their **exceptional fill efficiency**. Thanks to the gussets that expand on both sides, these pouches can hold a larger volume of product compared to flat pouches or other traditional packaging options. This design not only maximizes internal space but also minimizes wasted material. The upright structure makes the filling process smoother and faster‚Äîwhether automated or manual. Plus, the uniform shape ensures easy stacking and reduces the risk of damage during storage and transport. In a world where efficiency means everything, this packaging style ticks all the right boxes.

Equally important is the **shelf presence** that side gusset pouches deliver. Their structured, upright appearance creates a strong visual impact. Whether sitting on a grocery store shelf or displayed in a boutique setting, these pouches naturally attract attention. The broad front and back panels provide ample real estate for bold branding, eye-catching graphics, and important product information. Their ability to stand tall without external support helps them maintain a neat and professional look even after repeated handling. This strong shelf appeal often translates to increased customer interest and improved sales.

In addition, these pouches offer flexibility in size and finish, making them suitable for everything from coffee and snacks to pet food and personal care items. Brands can choose from matte, gloss, or metallic finishes to further elevate their image. And with options like resealable zippers or one-way valves, functionality is never compromised.

**Side gusset pouch** packaging continues to gain popularity across industries for good reason. Its smart design not only improves operational efficiency but also boosts brand visibility. Whether you're looking to optimize your packaging line or captivate customers at first glance, this pouch style offers the best of both worlds.",1,1758593638.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

My partner and I will be having a week long trip between Big Island and Oahu end of Nov. For Big Island, we've pretty much decided that we'd spend a couple days on the resort, a day doing Hilo/Volcano National Park, and another day on Kona side/down to the southern side of the island. We're currently looking for recs on coffee farm.

We have yet to do too much digging into Oahu but open to suggestions on what are some 'must do' (I know it's subjective but still!).

Also, we're planning on doing some snorkeling but unsure if we want to buy our own gear or just renting them. I've heard people say the mask is the important part so does it make sense to just buy the mask beforehand and rent the rest? We also don't love the idea of using snorkels that others have used for sanitary reasons but I'm guessing it really isn't as bad as we think?

1no5euk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1no5euk/whats_the_newest_feature_in_headphones_technology/,What's the newest feature in headphones technology?,"Hey everyone! I've been a huge audio enthusiast for years, and I recently dove deep into researching the latest headphone technology. I thought I'd share some mind-blowing features I've discovered that are changing the game in 2024.

First off, spatial audio has gotten incredibly sophisticated. It's not just about stereo sound anymore ‚Äì we're talking about 360-degree audio that actually tracks your head movement. Imagine watching a movie and turning your head left, and the sound adjusts exactly like it would in real life. Pretty wild, right?

But here's what really blew my mind: adaptive EQ. The newest headphones can actually analyze how they fit on your ears and adjust the sound accordingly. I found some amazing examples here: https://athometouch.com/headphones. These smart headphones literally create a personalized sound profile based on your ear shape!

Another breakthrough is bone conduction technology. Instead of going through your ear canal, these headphones transmit sound through your cheekbones. It's perfect for runners and cyclists who need to stay aware of their surroundings while enjoying music.

Battery life has also taken a huge leap forward. We're seeing wireless headphones lasting up to 50-60 hours on a single charge. Some even have solar charging capabilities ‚Äì just leaving them in sunlight tops them up!

The noise cancellation tech has evolved too. It's not just about blocking out noise anymore. The latest models can detect when someone's talking to you and automatically pause your music or let their voice through. Super convenient when ordering coffee or having quick conversations.

What I find really interesting is the integration with health monitoring. Some new headphones can track your heart rate, body temperature, and even posture. They're becoming like little fitness trainers that sit on your ears!

For anyone looking to upgrade their audio game, I've found some great deals on cutting-edge headphones here: https://athometouch.com/headphones. The prices are actually pretty reasonable considering all the new tech packed into them.

Have you tried any of these new features? I'm particularly curious about your experience with spatial audio. Let me know in the comments!

Turns out I actually have an extra 3‚Äì4 hours a day, enough to pick up new hobbies and live healthier. Not sure if I‚Äôm doing this right, but I have to admit that it really has changed me.

I finally started learning something I‚Äôd been curious about for a long time, I took a coffee class! Honestly, being surrounded by the smell of coffee beans feels so much better than staring at my phone all day. I met some new friends there and even picked up latte art, which I was super excited about. Now I actually enjoy making coffee at home, so I don‚Äôt need to buy it every day anymore.

When I‚Äôm just staying in, I usually spend some time cleaning up. I‚Äôll do the kitchen first, then let my robot vacuum handle the sweeping and mopping while I hang laundry or change the sheets. Way more efficient than mopping by hand, my deebot x8 pretty much does it all. Sometimes it even digs out cat hair or snack crumbs from under the couch. Saves me time and energy so I can focus on other stuff.

I‚Äôve also started spending more time outdoors. Before, my weekends were mostly just lying around at home, getting bored of scrolling on my phone.

There's a cheap house off of Water St that's basically a lock (something about a shooting?  Whatever, I'm from Alberquerque), so I'm basically halfway to moving here.

I'm not completely stupid, so I did take a trip here before I completely decided to move.  I gotta say, y'all are pretty rude.  Like, I'll have a conversation with someone, and another rando will walk through the doorway already starting a convo with them, then get all shocked that there's more than two people in the world??  This is something that just keeps happening.

And part of it is that you guys all know each other.  Like, creepily so.  You'd think it'd be a good thing, but no.  I can't talk about someone nice I just met or else half of everyone in the caf√© will crawl out the floorboards (because y'all eavesdrop.  RUDE.) telling me what a piece of shit they actually are.

And you'd think that would stop the other problem I have with your city.  Despite all these Montagues and Capets in your town, everyone and their cousins want to be Romeo and Juliet.  Which, okay, whatever.  But do you guys want to tell me why a bunch of you go around town snogging your half siblings' half siblings like that isn't weird?!?

And another thing.  I get it, I'm coming from a different area.  But like...

...is it just me or are there weirdly few Latinos?  I heard there were a few of us like a decade ago but, where did we go???

Settle in, this will be a long one.¬†



Backstory:



The cast Me(28f), Ella(29f), and Cece(27f), (fake names). I have known Ella since we were 5 years old, and we are very close, basically sisters. We‚Äôve had some problems over the years, as long-time friends do, but overall have had a good friendship. Ella and I met Cece when we were 12 years old. Cece has been a drama-seeking missile pretty much since day one. I, being young, naive, and a recovering people pleaser with abandonment issues, struggled with seeing it and with letting her go. Everyone has a breaking point, though.



Context:



So I won‚Äôt go into too much detail because this could turn into a novel if I do. So Cece has had a habit of playing the victim and causing unnecessary drama. Examples of said behaviour:



1 When I was 15 and Cece was 14, I had stopped talking to Ella for a period of time due to unrelated issues(we reconnected about a year later and have been good since). Cece got jealous of a new friend I had made during that time and started ditching me for Ella. Basically, for over two months, anytime I tried to make plans with Cece, she would agree and then the day of said plans would tell me she had forgotten and had made plans with Ella, once or twice, sure, but almost every week for 10 weeks, no. When I confronted her about it, she accused me of being jealous that she was spending time with Ella; it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered who it was; it was about deliberately ditching me. I did explain this to her, but she remained adamant that I was jealous(it came out later that she was jealous of my new friend). In the end, she sort of apologized, I forgave Cece, and we moved on.



2 In the months following example 1, Cece would repeatedly get mad at me over the stupidest things, and half the time I wouldn't even know why she was mad; she would just get mad for a day or two and then act like nothing happened, I got to the point of thinking she just liked fighting and having me grovel for her forgiveness even if I didnt know what I had done. I got to a point where she would get mad, and I would just immediately say sorry for whatever it was I may have said or done to upset her. Basically, I stopped fighting back. This also made her mad. Go figure.



I will admit, one of these times, I actually had done something wrong. The issue, though, is that instead of telling me what was wrong, she stayed mad at me, demanding I figure it out myself for days. Eventually, she did tell me, I profusely apologized and told her I understood she had every right to be upset, but I hoped she could forgive me. She then spent a couple of days belittling me for what I said and how she didn't know if she could move past it, I had enough, so I told her while she had right to be upset but didn‚Äôt have the right to bully me about it, if she needed space or didnt want to forgive me that was fine but I was done being a punching bag and she could talk to me when she was ready to have calm and mature conversation until then i wouldnt be responding to her. She quickly did a 180 and apologized, saying she was just hurt and had overreacted, and wanted to stay friends. I wanted to believe her, so I once again forgave her.



3 A couple of months after example 2, one day I got some disturbing news about my father(he was not a good person, but still my dad, so it was a hard time), it was very obvious that something was bothering me, Cece asked me what was wrong, I told her I didn‚Äôt want to talk about at that time because i was at school and didn‚Äôt want to focus on it, and I would talk to her about it after school, she proceeded to get upset that I wouldnt tell her, accusing me of not wanting to tell her because i didnt value her or something like that and that i had probably told another friend(same new friend from example 1, this was when it came out she was jealous), I hadnt told anyone, because I DIDNT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, after I spent most of my lunch period being berated because I wouldnt tell her I snapped and said my dad had threated to unalive himself 2 days prior and no one knew where he was or if he was ok(he was a narcissist so this was just threat trying to get a reaction out of people), I started to cry from feeling so overwhelmed and angry, exactly why I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it, she then started to apologize and say she didnt know it was that serious, and that if she had known she wouldnt have been demanding(why does it matter how serious it was), I told her i was now crying and I didnt want to talk to her for the rest of the day because i needed time to calm down after she so blatnanly bullied me to talk about something I wasnt ready to talk about. This led to several fights that led to us eventually not being friends for a few months. Unfortunately, I still didn‚Äôt learn my lesson and let her back into my life after she played the victim, you know, I‚Äôm a horrible friend, I never do anything right, I understand if you hate me and never want to talk to me again, I was upset that you spend so much time with your other friend and did express it well etc.¬†



(my new friend lived less that a block from me and went to my high school so yeah we saw each other a lot, Cece when to a different high school and lived about a 30 min drive from me, this is how things had been pretty much our whole friendship, Ella also lived very close to me at the time so I saw her a lot to other than the period we werent talking, so this jealously was odd given the situation)



4 Jump ahead to me being 17, my beloved mum passed away shortly after my 17th birthday from cancer, and I was understandably angry at the world. I feel I did a pretty good job at not taking it out on others, but it was definitely easy to upset me for close to a year after she passed. A few months after my mum's passing, Cece started basically ignoring me. I tried to talk to her multiple times, but got nowhere, until I told her I understood I was difficult to be around and talk to at the time, and if she was tired of dealing with my mood swings, it was ok, but to please be honest with me about what was going on because her ignoring me was hurtful and it felt like she didnt want to be friends anymore. She responded that she didn't know what to say to me anymore and that everything seemed to make me mad at her, so she ignored me. I said the only thing that was making me mad was her ignoring me, and I just wanted my friend to be there for me during a really difficult time, which I had expressed many times, so how did it make sense to continue ignoring me? She apologized(sort of, it was mostly more excuses) and said she would try to be better. Also at this time Cece started dating a new guy that no one liked, so she would use coming over to my place as a way to see him since he lived near me which i repeatedly told her bothered me and it wasnt ok, she kept telling me she would stop but didnt until i told her if she did it again we were done, this was about when she started ignoring me, coincidence I think not. Anyway, I forgave her, not wanting to lose who I considered my best friend while already grieving the loss of my mum.



5 jump to when I'm 19, Cece had decided to upgrade some high school grades, trying to better her grades before going to college. I was going through a very rough patch financially. So one day, Cece and I made plans to meet up after she was done with her classes for the day, she would have been done around 1230pm, she just had a couple morning classes, the day of the plans I made sure to wake up early(I had been dealing with sleep issues, and had a habit of sleeping very late), I texted her when I got up to say I was up and to let me know when she was done for the day and on the way to the train station(neither of us had our drivers licence) I got myself ready as I had an errand to run that day anyway(she was supposed to join me on this errand and then come back to my place since I couldn‚Äôt afford the bus fare to her house and back at the end of the day, she knew this), 1230 came and went and no response, I messaged her again about 1245 asking where she was and if she was on her way to the station, still nothing, I sent a third message about 1 asking for an update, still nothing, I didn‚Äôt get a response until almost 130, saying she was sorry she didn‚Äôt respond, but she was already at another station waiting for her bus home. I asked if she would be willing to come back to the station where we were supposed to meet, so we could keep our plans. She said she just wanted to go home because she was tired, but I could come over. I reminded her that I couldn't afford the bus fare and asked why she hadn‚Äôt answered me said something sooner. She claimed that she didn't think I was awake. I pointed out that I had texted letting her know I was up, so she didn't need to lie and could have just told me that she wanted to go home. To that, she said she wasn‚Äôt going to listen to me calling her a bad friend. I stupidly said I wasn‚Äôt saying she was a bad friend, just that what she did was shitty and hurtful. I accepted her half assed apology.



6 In 2019, when Ella and I were 22, Cece was 21, Ella had been dumped by her boyfriend of almost 5 years, this was about 3 months after he had proposed, the breakup was technically Ella's fault, she had admitted that she had been with another guy during the early days of the relationship BEFORE they were officially dating and another guy during a break they had taken and couple years pior, she wanted this out in the open before the relationship progressed and her boyfriend didnt like what he heard and ended the relationship(he did this 2 months after he was told and then immediately started dating someone else, I think he used it as an out when he met someone else, he proved after the breakup that Ella was very clearly better off without him, he was horribly cruel to Ella, but that is a story for another time) the breakup devastated Ella, Cece was supportive at first but quickly became bitter anytime Ella would talk about it and fully blamed Ella for what happened, insinuating Ella was a cheater even though she never actually cheated, emotionally or physically, I understood being frustratued because Ella was taking about it alot but she was hurting and once I asked her gently to tone it down a bit she did and apologized for being so focused on herself. I viewed Cece a bit differently after this. Especially since she wouldnt even talk to Ella about being frustrated, she left me to be the middleman, a trend in our friendship.



Many other things happened over the years, but these were the big ones, and I want to say in no means was I a perfect friend, but my screw ups were contained to my teenage/high school years, basically stupid high school drama, still doesnt make it ok or right but much easier to understand/forgive when its a 16 year old being dumb than 24 year old being a petty bitch. Luckily, I grew up and matured. Unfortunately, not everyone does¬†



Now on to the main event



So the beginning of the end was May of 2020, this is a 2 and half year saga, so I will try to summarize as much as I can.



In May of 2020, I started dating my boyfriend, who's a wonderful man, and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better partner to build a life with. Anyway, Cece seemed supportive at first, though she didn‚Äôt seem to want to make much of an¬†effort to get to know him. About the same time, Ella started dating my boyfriend‚Äôs best friend. It was a wonderful time. Cece even dated Ella and my boyfriend's third friend at one point, but they broke up in November of 2020(this is important for later). I think she was a little bothered that I had found a great guy without dating a bunch, while up until that, Cece had dated a long string of assholes (I was scared to date, fearing ending up with someone like my father, so I only had a couple of¬† relationships before this)



Due to COVID, none of us saw each other much during this year. We girls had a group chat to stay in contact. There was some issues in June of 2020 when I told Cece I was concerned about her current relationship, she was incredibly anxious about him leaving her etc. when I brought this up she got upset that I was saying her relationship wasnt good, he ended the relationship a couple weeks later because if was to much for him, she was sensing him pulling away because he wanted out, so I was right that something wasnt right.



In December of 2020, I was once again the middleman between Cece and Ella when Cece got upset with Ella because she didn't agree with a decision Ella made regarding her relationship with her boyfriend. Cece scolded her like she was a child. They didn't talk for months, and this whole thing didn't sit well with me.



Not much else of note happened until June 2021, when I decided to apply for college, with my boyfriend's parents helping me pay the application fee and deposit for me to apply(I got student loans for the tuition). I chose not to tell my friends that I had applied until I got accepted, but a week later, Cece told Ella and me she was thinking of applying for college and wanted our opinions on which course to take. She was debating between two; one was the same course I applied for(I had been talking about this career since my mum had passed away 7 years prior). Cece had mentioned it once, but had bounced around with what she wanted to do and never seemed to settle on one thing, not trying to say she was copying me or anything, but anyway, I said that this was exciting and that I had applied to the course, so if we both got in, we would be going to school together. I also gave my reasons for my career choice. Her tone changed; she didn't seem happy that we could end up going to college together, strange. I chose to ignore it. Shortly after this, Ella told us she was taking a child care course, which she completed successfully in October 2021.



Anyway, we did end up going to college together. At first, it was fun and we talked constantly, helping each other with assignments and homework, and complaining about the challenges of college and the career we were going into. Unfortunately, Cece failed a class near the end of our first term, meaning she would have to repeat the class. This also meant she had to miss the first clinical for our course, an exciting time since it was the first time we would be in the field, getting hands-on experience. She was understandably devastated; she failed for making to many mistakes during our final labs, where we were to showcase our skills, some of the mistakes she made could be dangerous in the work setting(for context, we were taking a health care aide course). Cece blamed the instructor for being too nitpicky and for her being nervous. She also had two chances to pass this lab; the instructor gave her a second chance, and she still failed for making too many mistakes.¬†



While I was doing the clinical, Cece was short with me, gave me bad advice when I was having an mild issue with my boyfriend at the same time(told me to basically ignore him until he reached out first, he was away for a course for his job that had him extremely busy, we are talking 15 hour days of classes and studying, we had barely talked while he was gone, and I was frustrated about it), I did not listen to this advice because I knew he wasnt purposefully ignoring me and it was just one of those time where he couldnt give me his full attention, Ella helped me to see things this way. Then Cece had an issue with her boyfriend, she dismissed what I said might be going on, which, when she finally actually talked to him, I ended up being correct(basically, he was stressed about a final exam, and she assumed he was losing interest in her; it was still a newish relationship, he was just stressed, he also pointed out to her she had done basically the same thing to him when she had be stressed during our finals a couple weeks before to the point he thought she wanted to dump him).¬†



Anyway, I told myself her attitude was because she was just upset about failing and wasn‚Äôt expressing it well, but there was no way I was actually the issue, right? Anyway, life continued. I completed the course a few months later, and Cece retook the class she had failed and passed. Yay! Cece was still short with me at times. I kept letting it go, I know stupid.¬†



So I graduated with honors in May of 2022, and this is when I couldn‚Äôt really ignore the way Cece was acting at this point. We were barely talking, and any time we did, it was her asking me something about school, but I didn‚Äôt want to confront her yet. I wanted her to be able to focus on schooling, and I was focusing on finding a job, I thought maybe whe she finished school we would be ok again, but I did keep a mental note of any hurtful things, planning to talk to her about it later on, when we were both less stressed and busy, like the fact that she never actually congratulated me on graduating or acknowledged it at all.¬†



My college has only one graduation ceremony a year, and since Cece should have completed the course by the end of August 2022, we would have still been in the same graduating class even though Cece couldn‚Äôt come to the ceremony due to classes at school(stupid setup, I know, but this is important later)



So I started working in July 2022. Cece asked me how my orientation went, but never asked me about my job again, which you would think that, since she was going into the same field, she would have at least some questions, but I guess not, no biggie. Another hurdle came for Cece at the end of July when she got an email from the school saying she didn't have one of the requirements she needed to do her final clinical, and she didn't have enough time to complete the requirement since it started in early August, so she had to postpone the clinical to December 2022. Cece blamed the school for not telling her sooner, even though she could have and should have checked her to-do list to make sure she had everything done, especially since this requirement was tied to the class that she had failed.



Since Cece missed graduation, her boyfriend's mom had planned a graduation party for Cece to celebrate, which was supposed to be held after she finished the course in August. They decided to still have this party in August, even though she wouldn't be done with the course yet, due to having to delay her last clinical. Ella and I were invited to the party, but neither of our boyfriends of 2 years was, which I found odd. Cece's reasons her boyfriend's mom wanted to keep it to family and friends, so apparently, our boyfriends, whom she had known for 2 years and had hung out with somewhat frequently, were not her friends at all and couldn't even come as our dates, I mean she didnt have to be best friends with them but still should have been friendly enough to be allowed an invite. Odd. Cece also said that they were trying to keep it small, ok, fair enough.¬†



At the party, though I started to doubt what she said since there was enough food and refreshments for a small army, there wasn't a ton of people, about 20, but why would having two more matter, especially with the amount of food, etc. also meeting her boyfriends mom she was very friendly and welcoming i doubt it was her would have had an issue with our boyfriends being there, it just felt like Cece didnt want them there for some reason, which its her party therefore her choice, so I let it go, though I suspected it was either because her boyfriend wasnt fond of them because they had differing views on drinking, smoking weed, etc (I‚Äôm from canada its legal here lol), her boyfriend didn‚Äôt part take in these things while Ella and my boyfriends did socially or it could have been she didnt want my boyfriend having a chance to mention my graduation at a graduation party, aka she wanted to be the centre of attention the whole party, which isn‚Äôt really a bad thing, or a combination of the two.

¬†

Anyway early on in the party(before anyone really arrived) i pulled Cece aside to give her a gift, I had bought a nice tumblers(the kind that keep your drink cold for hours) for Cece, Ella, and myself all engraved with the our names and the year we had completed our courses, I also had gotten an engraved beer glass for my boyfriend with his course completion year on it, it was supposed to be celebrate our achievements, unfortunately I had ordered these before Cece had to postpone her final clinical, so hers had the wrong year on it. So I gave it to her in private and explained the situation, saying I still wanted her to have it since it was for her, but I would be completely ok if she wanted to cover the engraving, scratch it out, or just throw it away, basically, it was hers to do whatever she wanted with, I also gave Ella hers since it was the first chance I had gotten to do so, Cece thanked me but seemed off bit off put, almost like I had insulted her with it, the tumbler was left in the bedroom and the party resumed. Everything else that day seemed fine.¬†



(I want to note something that I had a bit of an issue with, which isn't a huge issue. Cece never mentioned that I had graduated at the party, a graduation party. Now I understand that the party was for her and planned by her boyfriend's mom, who didn‚Äôt know me before the party, so I didnt think I would be the centre of attention or anything, but nothing from my supposed best friend kinda hurt and I felt that if the roles were reversed, I would have wanted my friend to be celebrated along with me, but maybe thats just me)



After the party, things were basically radio silence from Cece; that group chat we had since the beginning of COVID was basically used for Ella and me to talk, and for Cece to talk about herself. She had pretty much stopped responding to anything that wasn't about her or directed at her. The three of us did get together on Canadian Thanksgiving to go to a corn maze with our boyfriends. Cece and her boyfriend mostly ignored the rest of us, walking ahead of us in the maze and mostly talking to each other and not joining in the conversation that the rest of us were having. Overall, it felt like they didn't want to be there. This was the last time we saw Cece. Shortly after the corn maze, my grandma passed away, my last living grandparent and the only one I really knew(older parents, so other grandparents passed before I was born or when I was too young to remember). Cece never checked on me or even talked to me after I told her. This was my last straw; I was done. I decided instead of confronting her immediately, I would wait, collect myself, and have a mature conversation when I was ready. I know I should have right way, but after a 13-year friendship, there was a lot and a big decision to make if this was going to be the end for good. I was also grieving my grandma and wanted to focus on my mental well-being first. I did not get the opportunity. (My grandma passed at the end of Oct, I decided I was done at the end of November after a month of silence)



The finale



Right after New Year's 2023, Ella noticed Cece had left the group chat, no warning, nothing. I reached out and asked why, and if something was wrong, I don‚Äôt know if I actually cared or was just curious. Cece said that she felt we had drifted apart, that the group chat wasn‚Äôt really active anymore so there was no point being it, and that she felt we were only friends because we had been friends for so long(whatever that means), and that she had been feeling ignored and excluded since she broke up with the third friend of my boyfriends, over 2 years prior. She also brought up that I apparently only want to hang out when my boyfriend is busy, which was not true. I mean, my boyfriend and I would try to plan to see our friends on the same day so as not to miss time with each other, but it's not like if it didn't work out that way, I would just cancel plans with my friends or anything. The funny thing is, the last time we planned to hang out, just the three of us, Cece tried to change the day to a day when her boyfriend was busy. I couldn‚Äôt make the day she wanted work because it was my boyfriend's birthday. She also expressed an issue with Ella and me hanging out without her. Again, Ella and I lived close to each other, so it was easy to meet up for coffee or something quickly. Cece lived further away, so it was harder to have spur-of-the-moment hangouts, especially with no driver's license and limited funds for Uber. But also Cece never really tried to hang out with us, like never asked, usually it was Ella or me, also alot of the times Ella and I would hang out she was coming with me to walk dogs I would walk for some extra cash, which both Ella and Cece were always welcome to join me to do, Cece only asked to come twice and Ella would come at least once a month or more so we could hang out and get coffee/lunch after. This is also something Ella and I had always done for literally years, so I don't know why now it was an issue.



I apologized for anything I had done or said to make her feel that way, but I had never intentionally done those things. I then pointed out that she had been virtually impossible to talk to for months as well, so it wasn't one-sided. I also asked why she hadn‚Äôt said something sooner. According to her, this had been going on for over 2 years, so why not have a conversation sooner? I also explained that my boyfriend is my top priority within reason, and I'm of course going to work him into my plans and consider his plans, especially since we couldn't see each other much to begin with due to work, school, etc., unlike Ella and Ceces' relationships.¬†



She didn‚Äôt answer my question; instead, she said IF she had been acting that way, it was because of the way she was feeling and because there was nothing for her to respond to in the group chat(hello, start a conversation), I tried to explain that Ella and I had taken to talking privately because there was no point in using a group chat when the third person in the chat wasnt responding, I‚Äôll admit I explained this poorly not that it really mattered anyway. Cece responded by saying what I said didn‚Äôt make sense, and it was basically not her fault, and then said, and I quote, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to grow in life, and being friends with you and Ella is not helping.‚Äù Basically, we‚Äôre holding her back. I lost it, I had done so much for her, trying to help her and make finishing the health care aide course as easy for her as I could, I told her she couldn't blame us for her shortcomings, that she is the only person that could hold her back, so if she wanted someone to blame she should try looking in the mirror. She ghosted me after that.



Cece did send me an apology(if you can call it that) in November 2023(almost a year later)



‚ÄúI know it's been almost a year, but that has given me time to reflect. I‚Äôm sorry for everything that was said. I was just hurt, and I understand that you were too. My intention was only to talk about how I was feeling, I didn't mean for it to turn out the way it did. I know I've made mistakes, I acknowledge that. Our communication could have been better. I just wanted to apologize for my part in the situation, and was hoping that we could maybe get together to talk and get out thoughts and feelings out. If not, thats ok. But I just want to put that out there‚Äù



To me, this doesn't feel like a genuine apology, it feels so formal, like something you would write your boss when you fuck up at work, maybe I‚Äôm biased but it rubbed me the wrong way and either way when you tell your supposed best friend they are holding you back theres really no coming back from that, how can I trust that I‚Äôm not going to be who she blamed everytime somethings not going her way.



I did decide to respond a little while after.



My response



‚ÄúI‚Äôve been going back and forth on replying at all, and frankly, I don‚Äôt owe you a response, but I wanted to respond to get some closure for myself. I have no desire to talk to you about what happened, not now nor anytime in the foreseeable future, what you said and how you treated me was incredibly hurtful and frankly unforgivable. After my did died I promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt put up with anymore bullshit, this is me sticking to that promise. Have a good life.‚Äù



That was the last interaction between us.¬†



The funny thing is, almost 3years later, I still don't know exactly what happened, and I probably never will, and that's ok. I speculate she started feeling some type of way about me finally getting my life in order and doing well while she was struggling to do the same, and made up the feel excluded thing. Looking back at our friendship has opened my eyes to just how much I put up with because I didn't want to hurt her, but she never thought twice about hurting me. I'm much happier not having to dance around her feelings. My boyfriend and I recently bought our first house and have plans to get married and start our family in the near future. Ella is doing great; she and her boyfriend are moving at a much slower pace, which is fine. They are happy, and our lives are peaceful.

i don‚Äôt even know what possessed me but i caught a glimpse of myself in the big mirror they have in there. lights were soft, my shirt was a little too loose, and i suddenly got that tingly urge. stupid, right? i should‚Äôve just peed and left. but instead i sat on the edge of the tub, kinda leaned back, and let my hand wander.

at first it was just curiosity. like a quick rub to calm myself down. but then i started thinking about all the times i‚Äôd seen her dad walk around shirtless in the mornings when i‚Äôd slept over. broad shoulders, that salt and pepper look, the way he always smelled faintly like cologne and coffee. i know it sounds fucked up, but my brain went there and i didn‚Äôt stop it.

i slid my shorts down a bit, pressed two fingers against myself, and i was already soaked. i tried to be quiet, biting my lip, but the sound of my wet fingers made me even more nervous. it was like every second i expected the doorknob to turn. my heart was racing so bad.

then the worst/best part happened. the door wasn‚Äôt even locked. yeah, dumb me forgot. i was too caught up. i heard the handle click and before i could pull my shorts back up, he was already standing there. her dad. eyes wide, clearly not expecting to see his daughter‚Äôs friend spread on the bathroom counter with her hand between her legs.

time froze. i wanted the floor to swallow me. i muttered something like sorry sorry i didn‚Äôt mean... but my body betrayed me. i couldn‚Äôt stop rubbing, like the shock made it worse. his eyes flicked from my face to my hand, then back again. i swear i saw his throat tighten like he was swallowing hard.

instead of slamming the door, he just stood there a second too long. i arched my back, whispering fuck under my breath, and my orgasm hit me right there with him watching. legs trembling, breath caught, trying not to scream out. it was humiliating and thrilling at the same time.

he finally pulled the door half shut, but not before giving me one last look. i cleaned up quick, face red as hell, and when i walked back out, it was like nothing had happened. he sat back in the living room with his coffee, calm as ever. my best friend never suspected a thing.

but now every time i go over, i catch him glancing at me. not long stares, just quick little looks like he remembers exactly what he saw. and me? i can‚Äôt stop replaying it in my head. i wanted him to catch me‚Ä¶ and he did.",0,1758591789.0,confessions,3,0.2,False

It's impossibly hard for me to get up. I turn off all alarms and get up only after getting 12+ hours if I don't set any. Almost each morning is a disaster, I experience chronic headaches, can't work in the mornings and need a lot of caffeine. At the same time, I usually fall asleep at 5-6am, spending 2-3 hours just lying in bed. Music, white noise and meditations are helpless. For the life of me, I can't fall asleep early even if I've had a sleepless night. I've tried cutting back on coffee, waking up early, not sleeping all night to reset my sleeping schedule but all in vain. People say that I just need to wake up at 8am and it'll be fine, but if I do this, I just have the worst day possible and still don't sleep at night. The thing is that I feel really full of energy at night and the thought of finally getting some free time to dedicate to my hobbies is really appealing, but it chips away at my day life.

I keep telling myself I'm writing this for anyone who likes to wander into the cosmos of their own mind like a warning, like a flare. Still, it could be me trying to pin the world to the page so it stops slipping.

Backpacking has always been my anchor. When I was a kid and everything got too loud, I'd take off into the woods behind our place in Georgia, walk until the cicadas turned into a single long sound and the air went cool under the trees. I liked how the forest swallowed noise. I liked how light got filtered through pine needles and spider silk. The Appalachians feel different than other places. It's not quiet like a library. It's peaceful, like the mountain is pushing its thumb on the pulse of the land and slowing down life.

Moving to Florida for work felt like getting relocated to a frying pan. Flat, hot, sticky. The air down here doesn't move; it sits and sweats. I can't see a horizon without a billboard stuck in it. But the mountains are only eight hours away if you leave in the dark and drive like your brain depends on it. So I do. I still do. Those trips back up to Georgia feel like going home to a version of myself I don't have to explain.

We planned this two-day trip for the past month. Jake, Brandon, and I. I should say it now: my name is Hunter. Jake's been my friend since we were dumb kids getting scraped up on BMX bikes. Ten years of knowing exactly how he'll react before he does. He's serious. Responsible but in that quiet way that makes you forget he's always taking care of something. Brandon is a later addition. Jake's buddy from college. Like a stray that started following us around and then refused to leave. Brandon's the guy who always has a story, and it's always half true, and the other half is the part that should have killed him. He recently dived into a hot tub at a party. He fractured two vertebrae, then stood up with his neck crooked, asking if anyone thought he needed a hospital. Somehow, he didn't die from the break, and even more impressively, he is ready to join us on a hike again, only a year later. He brags about stealing Aldi steaks like it makes him an outlaw. He's dumb lucky, and I never really liked him, but Jake did, so I put up with him constantly doing stupid shit.

Last trip out, Brandon tossed a lighter into the fire ""as a joke,"" and it popped and burned neat constellations into my tent fly. I patched them with clear tape like Band-Aids on a sky. For this trip, I went overboard with a new bag, a new headlamp, a new tent, and the best food possible. Two frozen steaks for the first night, wrapped in newspaper. A couple of astronaut ice creams that taste like powdered vanilla, but the nostalgia makes it worth it. I found a trail on Reddit that looked like a good one, with less traffic, better views, and steeper climbs than most routes. The thread had a poorly scanned topo map and a comment saying, ""worth it,"" which, in backpacker language, can cover anything from scenic to near-death.

I left on Friday before sunrise. Florida leaked away behind me in long, wet rectangles of light. By Valdosta, the air shifted. By Macon, the sky felt taller. Somewhere after Dahlonega, the hills heaved up into more than a slight hill that Florida calls a mountain, and my shoulders came down out of my ears. I called Jake outside Commerce, and he answered like I dragged him out of a pit.

""It's Friday?"" he croaked. ""Shit. Meet me at my house.""

Jake wasn't packed. Of course, he wasn't. He had ramen and trail mix and nothing like a tent. I tossed him my spare because it's easier than scolding him. We hit the grocery for fuel, and then Jake called Bill, our usual guy. Mushrooms were the plan. Instead, Bill said, ""I've got something new.""

He held up a zip bag to the light: little translucent black gummies with gold flecks suspended inside, like someone had ground up a wedding ring and poured the glitter into jello. He called them stoppers. Said they froze time, but not in a DMT leave-your-body way. ""You're still in the world,"" Bill said. ""Just‚Ä¶ the world gets slow. Sticky. Like the second refuses to change.""

Twenty bucks a pop. Twice the usual. Jake didn't blink. My stomach did. Psychedelics in the backcountry are a dice roll on a good day; time dilation sounded like a dice roll with knives glued on. But I couldn't stop staring at those gummies. The gold didn't look like edible glitter. It looked like metal filings caught in a jellyfish. I said yes before I finished the thought.

We swung by Brandon's. Like always, chaos. His parents were in the house yelling, their voices hitting that too-familiar pitch old arguments have, the one that sounds like a fly trapped between window and screen. Brandon was on the porch drinking from a tall can, laughing at nothing. He had his pack, though. Credit where it's due. When we told him about the stoppers, he grinned like a kid and asked if he could take two.

""No,"" I said, and slapped his hand when he pantomimed snatching the bag. ""One each. We've only got enough for one a night apiece.""

He smiled like he agreed, and his eyes said I'll do what I want.

Up 19 to side roads, the Corolla is complaining like grandpa about every pothole. We stopped at a crusty gas station because the tank light popped on. Four pumps, two dead, a buzzing fluorescent light, and a top sign with the ""P"" in ""Pineview"" burnt out, so it read ""_ineview."" Two guys out front by the ice machine in those puffy jackets that always look damp and never look warm. One watched us while we pumped. He had that too-thin face and jittery jaw. He eased over when he saw the packs and asked, ""You boys going up Asher Mountain?""

We nodded. He shook his head like we'd told him we were swimming across an interstate. ""Don't camp up there. Not at night. Nothing good in those woods.""

Brandon snapped without missing a beat. ""We don't have shit for you, get the fuck out of here.""

The guy's mouth twitched. He spat near our boots and shuffled off, muttering. I told myself it was just the usual mountain lore. Appalachia collects stories like burrs collect pant legs. Every ridge has a thing, every hollow has a dead man's name. I've hiked enough. I've never seen anything but bear scat and people's trash.

The road into the trailhead turned to red clay and ruts. Rain earlier had slicked it to a paste that grabbed the tires and tried to kiss us into the ditch. Trees pressed close, pines and crooked oak, trunks dark with wet, beads of water trembling on leaves like held breath. The Corolla did that sideways slide a couple of times, where your heart falls through your feet, and then the tires grip and catch, and you pretend you didn't almost die.

Trailhead: a tilted wooden post, a bullet-pocked sign, a pull-off with enough room for three cars if everyone likes each other. Gray light under the canopy. The kind of light where a camera would turn the world to fuzz. We lit a joint and passed it, the smoke cut with that wet-leaf smell that always smells like rot and home at the same time. Packs up. Hip belts buckled. Click click. That little happy clatter of metal on metal that means you're about to disappear for a while.

I hadn't hiked this path before. The Reddit map said ""easy first half,"" but either they were lying or the forest decided to express itself. It was narrow, overgrown, a buckthorn slapping trail. Little wet branches whipped our arms and laid cold lines of water across our sleeves. The ground was all roots and hidden holes. The climb hit quick, a steep switchback that woke the lungs like a slap. We fell into the usual pace while going up the steep inclines of the Appalachians. Pass the joint, cough, laugh, and pass the joint. No one is willing to stop smoking and admit that their lungs are on fire from the climb. I can't complain, though, there isn't anything better than the smell of smoke and pine sap. It was getting slippery, though, and the dirt tasted like iron when it sprayed up in your mouth after a slip.

Brandon dropped half the weed in a puddle and swore like we'd pushed him. ""That was the good stuff, dude!""

""You didn't buy it,"" I said, but I was smiling because I was still soft enough to smile.

The fog rolled through in bands like ghost rivers. Sometimes it came up from the valley and slid through the trunks at knee height. Sometimes it hung in ragged sheets between trees, and you had to walk into it like a curtain into another room. When the wind pushed it, it went sideways, and the whole forest blurred like it needed to be wiped with a thumb.

By late afternoon, we climbed onto a ridge with a low rock outcrop. The view unfurled. Green layers of mountains, ridges stacked like old blankets, each one taller than the one in front of it. A vulture circled a lazy loop that made me jealous. I set up the little stove on the flat rock and thawed the steaks. The paper peeled off damp and left newsprint on the meat, which cooked away, and we pretended it made us smarter. Grease dripped, hissed, smelled like five stars. We ate steak and ramen and laughed at how good everything tastes when the air's cold and you worked for it.

Then the sky started bleeding purple, and the trees went black before the ground did. That's when I pulled the zip bag out. The stoppers shimmered in the firelight. The gold flecks woke up when the flames moved, pulsing like they were reacting.

""One each,"" I said. I meant it like a command. Brandon gave me his wide smile, like yes, sir, and still tried to sneak an extra one before my hand hit his head. ""Ouch, what the fuck, dude? I was joking!"" he shouted at me. ""I said one each stop being an asshat."" He dropped it after that and took his one.

The gummy hit my tongue, and my stomach dropped. Gasoline and pennies. There was a chemical top note like paint thinner and a rotten sweet underneath like cough syrup you left in a hot car. It stuck to my teeth, and I had to scrape it off with my tongue. Brandon made a face. Jake rolled his eyes and said, ""That can't be good,"" but chewed and swallowed and then raised his eyebrows like, ""Well, we're committed.""

At first, it was just the campfire. Pop, hiss, spark. The usual comfort. Jake told a story about a guy at work who printed thirty copies of his resignation letter and then forgot to resign. Brandon bragged about a girl who didn't exist. I let the noise move around me and watched the smoke. It went up. It did what smoke does.

Then it didn't.

The smoke folded. It bent like a ribbon being tucked into a pocket. It rolled back down into the flame like the fire had become a drain. The sparks didn't float up and outward. They shot sideways, a little golden school of fish that darted and grouped and then stayed in a knot like they were stuck in glue. I felt the first hair raise on my arms. I blinked, and the fire was like TV static ‚Äî the gray fuzz of a screen an old set makes when you kill the channel, and it hums that low, electric hum you can feel in your fillings. The static ate the shape of the logs and gave back a rectangle of gray noise that looked like heat shimmering on the road, but colder.

Jake had a line of drool shining on his chin and didn't know it. Brandon's mouth fell open and stayed. His eyes were wet, reflecting the static like tiny screens.

""Does the fire look like that to you?"" I asked, and my voice sounded like I was under a blanket.

Brandon said, ""The fire's fine, man. It's the trees.""

We looked. I swear to you, the forest had straightened. The randomness you expect from the different gaps, the weird spacing, and the drunk angles were gone. The trees stood in columns and rows, lined up like pews in a cathedral, trunks in perfect alignment front to back. The gaps between them were identical, cut to measure. In the distance, rocks aligned too, each the same size, spaced like someone used a football field as a ruler and stamped them across the ridge: rock, air, rock, air. My eyes tried to slide off it and instead stuck to the pattern like burrs to socks.

Then I heard water.

It started like a faucet being turned on in another room. A trickle that tickled the ear. It became a stream, then a rush, then full-on waterfall noise planted just out of sight, the kind of sound you feel in your chest and your teeth. It was so obvious, so loud that I said, ""We need water anyway,"" like that was a reason to stand up. We stood up. We left the fire. The rows of trees made walking in a straight line feel like walking down an aisle at the world's worst grocery store. Every time I thought we'd hit a bend in the trail, the bend slid one aisle over, same distance away. When I looked back behind us, the camp was gone. I saw aisle after aisle of trunks, each gap the same. Our firelight was already a lie my brain had told me. The other didn't seem to care, so I just kept walking with them.

We walked toward the roar until it filled the world, and then, as if somebody flipped a switch. Silence. The kind of silence that makes your ears ring their own private sound because the brain refuses to accept anything. No crickets. No owls. Not even wind. Just our boots pressing wet leaves and coming up with that sticky kiss sound.

That's when I realized it was still dusk. It had been dusk when we lit the fire. It was dusk when we stood up. It was dusk right now, even though it felt like half an hour had slid by while the waterfall sound grew and died. The sky had stalled at that bruised color with no stars yet and no sun either, like a clock with its second hand glued down.

I cursed for not bringing my headlamp. It was in my pack. I could have grabbed it. I didn't. That stupid little decision started to feel like the hinge the night swung on.

Brandon licked his lips. They looked pale in the half-light, like someone had pulled the red out of him. ""Do you guys‚Ä¶ still hear the water?""

""No,"" I said, and my voice came out thin. ""It's gone.""

We turned around to walk back, and the forest still hadn't changed. The rows stayed. The rocks stayed. The smell of our fire, meat, and smoke was gone. Our prints didn't show up. It was like we'd been walking on a new floor that rolled over the old one as we moved, covering tracks.

""Well fuck now we have to find our way back,"" I said as we started to move back. That's when I began to feel like something else was walking with us.

At first, it was footsteps that didn't match ours. Softer. The sound of small stones clicking against each other just to the side, like something with narrow feet was testing the ground. Then two of those. Then three. Every time we stopped, the extras stopped. Every time we moved, they resumed. Not in sync. Not echoes. Followers.

I didn't say it. Jake didn't say it. We tightened up without saying it, shoulders in, breaths shallow. Brandon kept glancing to the sides with his eyes only, his head locked forward like prey animals keep it when they listen for predators.

Then the forest started to talk.

An owl called. Not far. Not a deep night voice. A high one. Except it didn't hoot. It said my name. It pulled it apart into syllables like someone reading ""Huuun‚Äîterrr"" off a sheet of paper for the first time. The last r ticked in my ear in a long, dragged-out horror.

We froze. Jake's eyes cut to me. Brandon laughed without breath. ""You guys heard that, right? Tell me I'm not crazy.""

""It's just the drug,"" Jake said, but his jaw was locked.

A coyote yipped. Except it wasn't. It was Brandon's laugh, the exact laugh he'd made two hours ago when he told us the steak story. But it wasn't beside me. It was behind, somewhere down an aisle of trees. It sounded doubled, like it bounced around a long tube and came back as an echo, only the tube wasn't there. The hair on my neck turned to needles.

Brandon's smile fell off. ""That‚Ä¶ that was me,"" he said. Not a question.

We walked. What else do you do? The silence between the noises was worse. My brain put a faint TV hum in there to cover it because it needed something. And then the woods did my mother's voice. Clear as day. The exact tone she used when I was twelve and out after dark. ""Hunter? Time to come inside."" From about two aisles over. I froze in place, but the others didn't seem to hear it. They stopped, and Jake asked, ""What's wrong?"" I quickly snapped out of it and continued, ""Oh nothing lets keep walking."" I didn't want to repeat what I heard, which felt like something I didn't want outside my mind.

We passed the same stump three times. I know it was the same because a thick branch came out at the same angle and broke off at the same place, and the moss on the north side did a weird hook shape that looked like a question mark. Three times. Ten minutes apart. We passed a fallen log with a split that looked like a grin. Twice. The trail didn't turn back on itself. I swear to you it didn't. It reused itself.

I pulled my compass. The needle went slowly. It started to point and then kept going, like syrup sliding around a plate. It did a full circle, tired, then another. We didn't have north anymore. I checked my phone. Forty percent battery, then sixty-two, then nineteen. The clock read 7:12. Then 7:13. Then 7:12 again. I wanted to throw the thing into the trees because it was pretending to be a clock and wasn't.

We stopped to drink water we didn't need. I looked at Jake, and something in my brain stepped back one inch. His eyes looked wrong. Pupils wide, sure, but there was a ring around the iris that looked like the ring on a coffee mug. His mouth hung a little more open than a resting mouth should. His shadow behind him stretched longer than mine by a lot, even though we were next to each other. I blinked, and he was him again, but the afterimage sat there like the halo you see after staring at the sun.

Brandon stared at him and his hand flexed like it forgot if it was supposed to be a fist. ""Why's your face doing that?"" he asked.

Jake sighed. ""What are you talking about?""

""Your eyes,"" Brandon said. ""They're not yours.""

We laughed. We always laugh because what else do you do when tripping balls?

The granola bar thing happened next. I pulled one from my hip pocket, unwrapped it, ate half, and shoved the other half back in. I remember the taste of peanut and stale honey and the way it scratches your throat. Twenty minutes later, I reached for it again to finish it, and the bar was sealed. New wrapper. No tear. No crumbs in the pocket. I held it up and played with the seam, like maybe I had messed up, and then my stomach turned, and I shoved it back like I hadn't seen it.

Brandon's eyes wouldn't leave me. He kept stepping so he could see my face from a new angle without being obvious. He did the same to Jake. He spun, walking backwards for a while, never turning his back to both of us at the same time. The footsteps that weren't ours adjusted with us, trying to keep up, and that was the first time I really wanted to yell. That need hit my throat and died there.

""You're not Hunter,"" Brandon said. Quiet. Like to himself.

I managed a laugh. ""What the hell are you talking about?""

""Your voice,"" he said. ""It's not yours. It's‚Ä¶ wrong."" He looked at Jake. ""And you, your eyes keep freaking out. ""You think I'm stupid? You're not..."" He swallowed like his mouth had dried out. ""You're not you.""

""Brandon, breathe,"" Jake said. Calm voice. The one he uses when I start spiraling. ""It's the drug.""

""The drug's not making the forest straight,"" Brandon said, and he gestured out at all the aisles. ""The drug's not making the rocks line up like someone measured space with a ruler and I‚Äî"" He choked on the next word. ""I heard you behind me, Hunter. I heard you. Laughing.""

""We're all hearing weird things, Brandon. It's just the drug,"" I said in a reassuring voice. Brandon seemed to calm down slightly, and we stumbled upon what looked like the clearing we had set up camp at. A wider patch in the aisles where the rows opened a fraction. A dead stump in the center, like a table. Our fire wasn't there. Nothing from us was there. But the ground looks the same everywhere when it's covered in oak leaves stamped flat and damp, and we wanted out of the aisles, so we stopped. Jake crouched, the old man crouch he does when he's thinking. Brandon kept to the edge with his back to the trees, and pulled his pocket knife out, flipping it over and over in his hand. I could smell iron, which might have been from my cut across the knuckle from a branch, or it might have been in the air. The sky refused to change. Dusk held.

""What time is it,"" I said, and it wasn't really a question. ""7:12,"" Jake said.

""It was 7:12 before,"" Brandon said. ""It was 7:12 an hour ago."" ""We haven't been here an hour,"" I said. My mouth lied. My body said we'd been walking a lifetime.

The clearing had sounds again. Not real ones. It was like someone put in a soundtrack and played it too quietly. Little clicks that wanted to be twigs snapping but didn't commit. A hiss that wanted to be wind but didn't know how to move leaves. Mimic sounds. You could tell by the way the hair on the back of your neck didn't know if it should stand up or lie down.

""Sit,"" Jake said. ""We're gonna ground and ride it out.""

Brandon laughed. Low at first and then high like a kettle. ""Ground? With you? With it?"" He pointed the knife. The point wobbled because his hand was shaking. ""You think I don't see it?""

""See what,"" I said, and the static hum climbed my jaw into the hinge of my ear.

""You,"" he said, and his voice split into two versions that almost matched. ""You're wearing him. Like a suit. Like a... like a deer skull on a man. You think I'm..."" He breathed hard. ""You don't even move right."" I didn't realize I had my hands out until I saw them. Palms open, fingers soft. The universal we're okay gesture you give to a skittish dog. ""Brandon,"" I said. ""It's me. It's Hunter. We ate steak and ramen. You spilled the weed and cried about it.""

His eyes flicked fast like a hummingbird. ""That's easy to say.""

Jake stood slowly. ""Brandon, put the knife down.""

""You say my name like that again and I'll cut it out of your mouth,"" Brandon said. He stepped right, just a hair, so we were no longer in line. He wanted us separated. He wanted our faces in frame one at a time so he could be sure. ""You think I don't hear you two whispering when I look away? You think I didn't see your shadow stretch wrong? Your teeth look longer when you talk.""

""Okay,"" Jake said. ""We're going to breathe. In for""

Brandon moved.

It wasn't clean. It wasn't a movie scene where the bad guy attacks you. He lunged like he forgot how to run and remembered at the last second. The knife came at Jake, low, clumsy, fast. Jake got an arm up and caught the blade across his forearm, a flash of red, a mouth opening in skin. I yelled and grabbed Brandon's wrist and felt the tendons under my palm jumping. He was strong. He twisted like his bones were greased. The knife skated. Jake shoved him, shoulder to chest, and Brandon laughed. That doubled laugh. Two voices almost on top of each other, so it sounded like a chorus with one guy out of time.

We hit the ground in a knot. Leaves in my mouth. Dirt in my mouth. That iron taste again. The knife came down toward my face, and I shoved the flat of it with my thumb, and it sliced the pad, and I saw white under the red for a second, and then my hand was hit out of view from Jake tackling Brandon. They rolled. They hit the stump. Brandon swung the knife and caught Jake shallow across the ribs, and the sound Jake made was like a dog being kicked, and my chest locked, and something inside me said rock.

There was a rock at my knee, flat, hand-sized, and wet. I picked it up. It felt heavy in a way rocks are heavy, but also in a way rocks aren't. I didn't think. I didn't reason. I ran to where Brandon and Jake were still on the ground and swung. It caught Brandon across the side of his head, and he went off, his eyes trying to focus on me and not getting there. The knife wobbled. Jake kicked it, and it skipped into the leaves, and I saw the gleam once and then not again. Brandon tried to stand and couldn't. He laughed again, except this time it wasn't two voices; it was three. His mouth didn't match any of them.

""Stop,"" I said. ""Stop, stop, stop, stop!""

He came again, one arm hanging, one arm clawed, and there was no more talking. Jake hit him shoulder-first, and they went down together. I brought the rock down again and again because my brain had become a single command that said Make him stop and didn't have room for anything else. There are noises you make when you lift weights: those came out of me. Then there are noises something makes when it breaks: I won't write those. We stopped when we were both too tired to lift our arms, and the hum in the air faded, and my hands shook like I was going into hypothermia.

Brandon lay back, looking at the canopy. His eyes didn't blink. His chest didn't move. The rows of trees behind him lined up like a barcode that went on forever. Jake's breath came in tears, little shreds. He pressed his hand to his arm, and it came away slick, and he looked at me like he was six and I could fix it.

""We have to..."" I said, and didn't have anything after that. We turned away for a second. Maybe we both did. Maybe only I did. We turned away because the blood looked like a map I didn't want to read. When we turned back, Brandon's body was gone.

We didn't decide to run. We just ran. The aisles blurred. The straight rows made a flicker-book of trunks on either side. Every four steps I looked back and saw nothing and saw everything, depending on how my lungs moved. The footsteps multiplied. The voices got smart. They learned our tones and gave them back wrong. ""Hunter,"" said Jake's twisted voice, from the trees to my right, casual like a friend at a party who wants to tell you a joke. ""Jake,"" said something that sounded like me from the left, soft, almost a question. The owl repeated my name and added Please.

I tripped and ate dirt, and a piece of a stick went into my palm and came out slick, and my hand didn't feel like a hand. Jake hauled me up by the back of my shirt, and we kept going. The rows repeated. We passed the stump with the question mark moss. We passed the log with the grin split. We passed the rock I'd used, or one that looked exactly like it, lying clean in the leaves. I don't know how long we ran. I looked at my phone and saw 7:13. Then I saw 7:12. This shit is never going to end, I thought to myself, and kept running.

At some point, I fell and didn't get up. The world narrowed to the size of two leaves and the thread between them. The hum in my teeth got louder until it was the only thing. Everything got dark like the dimmer turned down, not like a switch. The last thing I remember is my own voice calling from the trees. Not Jake. Not Brandon. Me. The exact way I sound when I'm tired and trying to sound like I'm not. ""Hunter. This way. Hurry.""

And I went. I didn't choose it. My body chose it. I tried to fight, and the world slid, and then it was gone.

I woke up in my bed. I tried to yell, but I had no air. All I could hear is my phone alarm doing the little chime I hate. Blind light striped across the wall. Florida light, flat and colorless. I stared at the ceiling, and it was my ceiling. I lay there and waited for Jake to lean over me and grab me, but nothing happened. I let my breath escape me in a laugh, letting my body push the panic out of me. It was all just some sort of twisted dream my brain made up. I turned over and turned off my alarm. The phone said Friday. The day we were supposed to leave.

It took me a minute to stand. My knees were stiff in that post-hike way like I'd been walking all weekend. My hip flexors did that little click thing. I told myself it was because I slept wrong. My palms ached. My left one burned when I curled it. There was a little tacky spot like a scab line. I told myself I scratched it on something here, at home, in the most normal place in the world. The calendar on the wall in my room said we were leaving today. The printout with the route and mile markers hung by a magnet on the fridge next to a shopping list that said eggs, toilet paper, and steak.

I went to the bathroom sink and turned on the tap. The water that came out sounded like a waterfall, a football field away. It filled the sink, and as I watched, it looked like TV static for half a second and then water again; normal, clean water. I looked at myself in the mirror. My pupils were a little wide, as if a room had dimmed. My mouth hung open just a little because I forgot to finish closing it. I stared at my eyes and waited for a ring to move across them like coffee in a mug, and it didn't. I laughed again, softly, and this time it sounded like someone else, and then it sounded like me again. I could go outside. I could get in the Corolla and drive north. I could knock on Jake's door, and he would open it, and be Jake, and I would be Hunter. We would laugh, and he would ask if I was ready to go. I would say sure, and then my brain would fall through a trapdoor. We would be standing on a ridge, eating steak, and watching a fire's smoke go up like it should instead of down, but when I went to the door to check the weather, I noticed my boots. They were my hiking boots in their usual spot, that I always leave them, but they were wrong. When I knelt down to look at them, I noticed there were tracks from the door that I hadn't cleaned up. Mud tracks, and there was mud on my boots. It was red Appalachian clay.",2,1758591558.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

""The only characteristic of people that can be counted on is intelligent self-interest. Thus, the true measure of good vs. evil is how much a person is willing or unwilling to subordinate their self-interest for the common good.‚Äù
 
Prologue
 
Devin St. Clare walked into the secure room in just sweats and flip flops. While it was late at night, no one there would question him regardless of the time of day. 

Sitting at the secure conference room‚Äôs table was his longtime ally and friend Tony Long who was staring at an empty coffee cup. Devin looked over at his bodyguard Steve and nodded him out of the room. Steve looked unhappy but complied without comment. He could join the club of unhappy people today and Devin was pretty sure this was a conversation he would need to keep completely private.

After Steve left, Devin sat down across from Tony and asked, ‚ÄúHow did it go?‚Äù

Tony‚Äôs face went through a dozen emotions from almost fear to anger to grudging respect back to anger. ‚ÄúThe contract is fine, he set the terms exactly where they should be. I don‚Äôt like the son of a bitch. I think we are better off just making him disappear with a .22 to the back of the head.""

Devin looked thoughtful for a second, ‚ÄúToo many people involved already.‚Äù

Tony countered ‚ÄúNot really. They are or were our people. We just tell them to shut up and forget it. Who are they going to go to?‚Äù

Devin frowned but acknowledged the point with a slow nod.

Tony continued ‚ÄúThis will change everything, and we could easily lose control completely.‚Äù

That was the rub Devin thought. He spoke aloud ‚ÄúTony when I first hired you oh so many years ago it was because you‚Äôre smarter than me.‚Äù

Tony snorted at that but with his almost imperceptible grin that went away as fast as it came.

‚ÄúBut you have a weakness, you don‚Äôt like people smarter than you are, rare though they are. And he was without a doubt the smartest person in the room today‚Äù. They both knew who ‚ÄúHe‚Äù was. Devin continued ‚ÄúHe has had nine months, maybe a year to think about this. We have had what eight hours? You don‚Äôt think he has anticipated anything we might do?‚Äù

Tony unhappily said ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter, whatever contingencies he has we can make them go away. It is just a function of how much of a mess it will make. Given the potential downside of proceeding no mess could be that bad.‚Äù

Devin rubbed his tired eyes, then looked over at Tony ‚ÄúThere is an upside almost beyond anything we ever imagined.‚Äù

Tony even more unhappy nodded ‚ÄúBut the risks can‚Äôt be anticipated, and you know it.‚Äù

The President of the United States Devin St. Clare looked at his Chief of Staff Dr. Anthony Long and acknowledged he had a decision to make. Maintain the status quo or take the gamble presented to him today and it was one he needed to make before he left this room.
 
Nine Months Earlier
 
The Farm Anderson County Tennessee, USA
 
Robert ‚ÄúJust Bob‚Äù Smith sat in his kitchen drinking his post workout coffee ‚Äúdoom scrolling‚Äù social media on his tablet. As was typical, it was no, swipe; no, swipe; oh hell no! swipe. 

Finally, a video popped up worth watching. The content creator, an awkward term if there ever was one, was talking about Dr. Lin Yue‚Äôs theory on antigravity. The physics PhD had disappeared from academia into the defense research labs and had not been heard from since. 

So, the tin foil hat brigade was out in full force on what she was doing. Her theory set out a number of approaches including super cooling to support super conduction as well as high temperature super conduction to create an antigravity field.

Bob leaned back in his stool‚Äôs backrest thinking. Interesting, I would expect that conventional thinking would focus on cryogenic cooling to get the needed superconductors but that just leads to all kinds of engineering issues especially if you want to get out of a lab and actually do something. No, the right answer is to develop a room temperature superconductor first.

 Using his tablet, Bob got charged $75 to pull Dr Lin Yue‚Äôs published papers and read through them. It was good work, although he thought one of her assumptions was understating a value.

Bob got up after finishing his third cup of coffee, showered, got dressed in jeans, a sweatshirt and walked outside his house and looked around. He never tired of the view. Molly loves it... damn... loved it too.

Three months prior, Molly Smith, Bob‚Äôs wife of 32 years, finally succumbed to cancer after five years of surgery, chemo, and radiation. It tore his soul the way she suffered but not once did she lose her sardonic wit or her smile, even in the end when she knew.

Bob needed something, a project, even at 60, he was not ready to just do ‚Äúnothing‚Äù. He had sold his company, BRG for an obscene amount when Molly was diagnosed with breast cancer. Even after profit sharing with the company staff, he could do anything he wanted.

So, antigravity. I need to solve the room temperature super conductor first. His thoughts paused for a moment then continued, You know, we never did do that experiment I suggested back in the day. I wonder‚Ä¶

He went into his office and fired up his desktop. Bob had very decided ideas on cybersecurity. 35 years as a happy part of the military industrial complex had taught him that. His former employer LM, one of the largest defense primes, had gotten hit hard exactly once and Bob had been a part of the team managing the cleanup. The job sucked and had finally given him the motivation to start his own company.

 Everything on the farm was on an air isolated network or went through a VPN and the best hardware firewall that money could buy on top of some custom work Molly had done.

Bob went through an inventory of what he had on hand and then generated a list of needed equipment. He went to MacMaster and ordered glass tubing, heating elements, magnets, reels, some stepper motors and controllers. Next, he ordered more acetylene and argon bottles. 

The part he thought would be hard, finding someone to supply iron nano particles for catalyst, turned out to be pretty easy, since the infamous ‚ÄúNano super patent‚Äù expired.

He had been a part of an R&D team at LM looking into Carbon Nano Tubes (CNTs) and while they had technical success on many fronts, they ran into freedom of practice issues once they did a second stage review with the patent attorneys and finance folks. 

A professor at an ivy league school decided that any utilization of CNTs was his intellectual property and got the US Patent Office to agree. The 175 claims stifled any scaling or commercialization of the tech, after all the professor had no interest in anything except suing companies that were willing to take the financial risk in scaling a lab curiosity into viable products. 

18 years later, even though the patent expired, CNTs were no longer seen as viable investments. AI was the big thing now, not that Bob gave a crap. 

With more than a dozen patents with both LM and later his own company, he despised inventors whose business model was suing someone for infringement. Never once would they take the risk of building something outside the lab or academia. Bob had taken the risk, quit his job, started his own company and it paid off.

Bob downloaded the CAD models of the hardware he ordered onto a new jump drive from the open box of 30. Well, 25 now. Generally, data only went into the shop never out, only finished hardware. 

Bob walked back through the house, the back yard, and back fence gate and up to a reinforced steel door leading into a large industrial metal building. After keying in a code and using his fingerprint, he stepped into the ‚Äúshop‚Äù. 

He couldn‚Äôt help but smile. Ten thousand square feet and literally millions of dollars of high-tech fabrication and test machinery for his ‚Äúhobbies‚Äù. 

The whole thing had been Molly‚Äôs idea. She hated it when he ‚Äúhovered‚Äù even on her bad days. She would kick him out of the house to ‚ÄúGo play‚Äù. 

And after 20 years in the Navy and 15 in the defense industry, there wasn‚Äôt much he couldn‚Äôt design, fix, fabricate, or program.

‚ÄúGood morning, Felix.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning, Bob. I hope you are feeling well.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am OK, thanks for asking.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome, Bob.‚Äù

Bob sat down at the CAD station linked to a beast of a server rack where the design AI ‚ÄúFelix‚Äù lived. He (It?) was a unique, state-of-the-art AI with voice control and facial recognition capabilities. You name it, Felix could do it, he could assist with mechanical, electrical, process control, and software/firmware design. 

Felix had been Molly‚Äôs brainchild, the culmination of her life‚Äôs work. Where needed she had leveraged very well-paid contractors under a brutal NDA to assist in the development. Contrary to pop culture clich√©s, advanced software development is a team sport. What Molly had done was farm out the various interface modules and wrote the core AI code herself. 

The brilliance of Felix‚Äôs architecture was that he could port in other AI packages and do the detailed prompt engineering based on the user‚Äôs input. She even paid extra for the rights to use a deceased actor‚Äôs voice simulation of a very obsessive, fussy New Yorker from a 1970‚Äôs SITCOM. Felix got his name from that character.

Molly had been almost manic to get Felix to a usable state once her health really started to deteriorate. More than once, Bob had to carry her to bed after she fell asleep on her keyboard. 

Six months before she died, Molly pronounced Felix ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù, her highest praise. The whole project cost a LOT, but money was just a tool once you got past a certain point. All that mattered was she wanted to do it.

While Felix wasn‚Äôt creative per se, with a base idea and machine learning, he could take a concept and run with it. He took care of all the grunt work needed to fully detail a design then fabricate it. Felix could load the machines with parts, liquids, or filaments, do basic maintenance tasks and happily clean the shop. 

Bob‚Äôs ‚Äúplaying‚Äù over the last few years resulted in a pretty good all-around humanoid industrial robot that could manipulate a set of tweezers or a pallet jack and everything in between. 

Bob still liked to get his hands dirty, but Felix took care of the tedious repetitive work. Bob smiled again thinking back to some of the hilarious disasters in getting the thing to work reliably. Felix‚Äôs robot body was the only wireless equipment in the shop, thank goodness the steel shop was a natural Faraday cage with only a couple of modifications to allow his cell phone to work, monitor the various security cameras on the property, and the ‚Äúbaby cam‚Äù that kept an eye on Molly even when there was a full-time nurse at the end.


‚ÄúFelix, I am loading a set of CAD models into the library. Open a new top level project named ‚ÄòAntigravity‚Äô with a sub project named ‚ÄòSuper Conductor‚Äô. Move all the new models into the sub project file. Also add a link to our standard parts library.‚Äù

‚ÄúAction complete and ready for further instructions.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are going to need to design a variable speed magnetic accelerator that we can heat up to the Curie Point of iron in a mainly acetylene atmosphere. The goal is to be able to move an iron catalyst particle from 1 millimeter in diameter to as small as we can practically handle down a glass tube to make long CNTs.‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst task is getting a controllable linear movement of the iron catalyst particle down a one meter glass tube. Second, see how much heat we can apply and still maintain movement control of the particle. Third, we need a gas handling system for multiple gas mixtures and an exhaust system. Because we are going to be relatively cool for CNT generation, we are going to have to be creative with our gas mixtures. Speaking of that, remind me before I leave for the day to order a bigger gas manifold. The one we have now can only handle four gasses.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let you forget... as always.‚Äù

‚ÄúNag.‚Äù

‚ÄúSniff.‚Äù

Molly had programmed Felix to throw in the occasional zinger, not always, just enough to throw Bob off. She used humor generation to help the machine learning bit. Felix‚Äôs growth potential was kind of scary. Besides security, another reason to keep Felix away from the internet, he didn‚Äôt need any other sources of inspiration. 

While Felix was potentially the most secure piece of software ever written and having the best ‚Äúguardrails‚Äù that Molly could develop and/or ‚Äòborrow‚Äô from government and industry, it was better to be safe than sorry. Bob really didn‚Äôt want to go through life as an AI‚Äôs ‚Äòstraight man.‚Äô

‚ÄúFourth, develop a variable feed system for the iron catalyst. Fifth, develop a reel system to capture and store the CNTs. What am I missing?‚Äù

‚ÄúBob, per my database we are going to need a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and iridium targets for the sputter machine for sample prep.‚Äù

Bob scratched his head and said, ‚ÄúCrap, that‚Äôs going to cost. After dinner I will go on the internet and see what I can find. Hopefully someone will have a used one in stock. Lead times for one will probably suck otherwise.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Bob.‚Äù

Bob cracked his knuckles and said, ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs get started.‚Äù
 
                               <<<>>>
 
Hours later, Bob stretched and got out of his chair. ‚ÄúFelix please keep running those simulation permutations of the magnetic field vs. Iron‚Äôs Curie Point and we will look at them tomorrow morning. I have a feeling the best we are going to be able to do is 760¬∫ which is going to cause a whole other set of problems. Hopefully you will be able to pull a rabbit out of your hat.‚Äù

Felix deadpanned ‚ÄúAre you going to get me a hat? If so, please make it a Fedora.‚Äù

Bob closed his eyes and said, ‚ÄúNot right now, plus it may slip off and block your bodies sensors not to mention looking ridiculous.‚Äù

Felix again deadpanned ‚ÄúI‚Äôm devastated.‚Äù


Bob rubbed his eyes and said, ‚ÄúRight... I think I need to blow off some steam. I will see you tomorrow.‚Äù

Bob could have sworn he heard some sarcasm, when Felix said, ‚ÄúYes Bob... Don‚Äôt forget the gas manifold and you may want to put it as an alarm in your phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúNag.‚Äù Sighing, Bob started to put the reminder in his phone.

‚ÄúSniff.‚Äù

This card is a no-brainer for people who want a mix of cash back and travel rewards without the hassle of multiple cards. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

* **3% cash back on restaurants and drugstores**¬†‚Äì Perfect for daily essentials like groceries and coffee runs.
* **5% cash back on travel booked through Chase**¬†‚Äì Even if you don‚Äôt travel much, this is a great rate for any flights or hotel stays you might plan.
* **1.5% cash back on all other purchases**¬†‚Äì That‚Äôs a solid baseline, especially for big-ticket items like electronics or medical expenses that aren‚Äôt in bonus categories.
* **No annual fee**¬†‚Äì That‚Äôs a huge win for a card with such strong rewards.
* **0% intro APR for 15 months**¬†‚Äì Great if you‚Äôre planning to consolidate any small balances or just want to build credit.
* **$200 sign-up bonus after $500 in purchases within 3 months**¬†‚Äì Quick and painless to unlock if you already have regular expenses.

**Best for:**¬†People who want a single card that works well in everyday categories like dining, groceries, and travel, with no limits on most bonus categories.

# 2. Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card ‚Äì The Foodie‚Äôs Dream

If you're someone who eats out a lot or spends heavily on groceries and streaming, this one is¬†*your*¬†card. Here‚Äôs the scoop:

* **Unlimited 3% cash back at restaurants, grocery stores, and eligible streaming services**¬†‚Äì Think Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and more. No limits here, so it‚Äôs perfect for big spenders.
* **1% cash back on everything else**¬†‚Äì Nothing fancy, but it‚Äôs enough to keep earning without overcomplicating things.
* **0% intro APR for 12 months**¬†‚Äì Good for short-term balance transfers or building credit quickly.

https://preview.redd.it/yfptnhu5ftqf1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c8df73ff0ccb078436618f6f942d3a6f5c3b8d1

This card is all about flexibility. It‚Äôs especially good if you can plan your spending around the quarterly bonus categories.

* **5% cash back in rotating categories**¬†‚Äì These include things like gas, groceries, and Amazon (see the current rotation below). You get up to $1,500 in eligible purchases per quarter.
* **1% cash back on all other purchases**¬†‚Äì Not the highest, but reliable.
* **Unlimited Cashback Match in the first year**¬†‚Äì That‚Äôs where it gets¬†*really*¬†good. If you earn $150 in cash back during your first year, Discover will match it and give you an extra $150. So if you spend $10,000 in a year at 1.5%, you could end up with $300 in total cash back.
* **0% intro APR for 15 months**¬†‚Äì Another solid feature if you‚Äôre planning to tackle any balances.

Even if you don‚Äôt travel often, this card still offers a solid rewards structure that can be useful in multiple ways.

* **5x points on travel booked through Chase**¬†‚Äì If you plan any trips, this is a killer rate.
* **3x points on dining and streaming services**¬†‚Äì Great for everyday use, especially if you eat out or watch a lot of shows.
* **1x points on everything else**¬†‚Äì Still better than most base rewards, and those points are valuable.
* **75,000 bonus points after $5,000 in purchases in 3 months**¬†‚Äì That can be worth up to $1,125 in value depending on how you redeem.
* **Points Boost**¬†‚Äì Some travel bookings through Chase are worth 1.5 or even 1.75 cents per point, so you can get more value from your rewards.
* **$95 annual fee**¬†‚Äì It‚Äôs not free, but the rewards and transfer options often justify it for frequent users.

**Best for:**¬†People who want to maximize travel rewards or enjoy the flexibility of transferring points to partners like United or Southwest.

Let‚Äôs say you spend¬†**$4,000/month**¬†and don‚Äôt travel much. Here‚Äôs how each card stacks up for you:

# Who Should Pick What?

* **If you eat out or shop groceries a lot and love streaming:** **Capital One SavorOne**¬†is your best bet. It gives you the most consistent rewards without limits on dining and groceries, and the welcome bonus is a nice start.
* **If you prefer a no-fee, all-around card with good base rewards and some travel perks:** **Chase Freedom Unlimited**¬†is the way to go. It simplifies the rewards game and pairs well with other Chase cards if you want to boost your value later.
* **If you‚Äôre a strategic spender and can time your purchases around bonus categories:** **Discover it Cash Back**¬†is perfect. The rotating categories let you tailor your rewards, and the Cashback Match is a huge bonus.
* **If you occasionally travel or want the option to transfer points to airline/hotel partners:** **Chase Sapphire Preferred**¬†is the best. Even if you don‚Äôt travel, the 3x points on dining and the ability to transfer to partners like United or Southwest gives you more flexibility.

# Bonus Tip ‚Äì Pairing Cards for Maximum Value

If you want to take your rewards game to the next level, consider pairing cards strategically:

* **Chase Freedom Unlimited + Chase Sapphire Preferred:**
   * You can use the Freedom card for everyday purchases and the Sapphire for travel and dining. Plus, if you earn points on the Freedom card, you can transfer them to the Sapphire or even to airline partners for better value.
* **Capital One SavorOne + Capital One Venture One:**
   * Transfer the cash back from SavorOne to the Venture One card and use it for travel bookings. This gives you the best of both worlds: high dining rewards and travel flexibility.

# Final Verdict:

* **Best overall for non-travelers:**¬†**Capital One SavorOne**¬†for its no-fee, unlimited dining/grocery rewards.
* **Best for simplicity and base rewards:**¬†**Chase Freedom Unlimited**¬†for its 1.5% on all purchases and no annual fee.
* **Best for flexibility and future travel plans:**¬†**Discover it Cash Back**¬†for the rotating categories and Cashback Match.

Friendship is one of the most valuable bonds we can have in life. Yet, in today‚Äôs world, finding a true friend feels almost impossible. Honesty, loyalty, dependability, and empathy are the strongest pillars that support this relationship.

This is my story, my experience of friendship, and how it shaped me over the past thirteen years.

I first met my best friend during high school. From the very beginning, our conversations felt different, as if we had known each other in another life. Slowly, time passed, and we became not just good friends, but the closest of companions.

We lived in the same city, often visiting each other‚Äôs homes. I would regularly go to his house and his father‚Äôs shop. Weekends were our special time‚Äîwe enjoyed coffee, lunch, and endless conversations. Birthdays were a celebration too, and although he sometimes forgot to wish me, we always managed to make those moments unforgettable.

In my family and among other friends, I proudly introduced him as my ‚Äúbest friend.‚Äù Even when I came home late, my family would ask the same question: ‚ÄúWere you at your friend‚Äôs shop or house?‚Äù That‚Äôs how much trust and value everyone placed on this friendship.

I shared everything with him‚Äîevery secret of my life, no matter how big or small. Eventually, we graduated, and I started preparing to go abroad. I discussed this with him openly, and even he showed interest in moving, though I felt he was unsure. One day, he came to my house with his father to learn about the process, the fees, and whether life abroad would really be worth it.

But then, everything changed.

A month later, when I visited his shop, I met his father and asked why my friend wasn‚Äôt answering my calls. His father casually told me that his son would be back later. He then asked me what it felt like to travel by airplane. I laughed and said I didn‚Äôt know, since I had never traveled that way before.

That same evening, I received a text message‚Äîand in that moment, I felt the ground slip from beneath my feet. My best friend had already flown to his dream country. He never told me when he left, how he left, or anything about it. The news broke me. For two years, I couldn‚Äôt talk to him because the hurt ran too deep. I had always believed he would share such an important milestone with me.

Now, I am also living in the same country. But the person I once called my best friend has completely changed. He no longer shares even small details of his life‚Äîwhere he works, what he does, which car he drives‚Äînothing. It feels as though the bond we once had has vanished.

This journey of friendship has left me with questions that I still search for answers to:
	‚Ä¢	In friendship, do we need to share everything with each other?
	‚Ä¢	Should both friends always support each other equally?
	‚Ä¢	Are personal goals and plans more important than true friendship?
	‚Ä¢	Do we need just one best friend, or is it better to have a wider circle to enjoy life with?",1,1758590120.0,u_Ok-Ratio8440,0,1.0,False

Business Environment in Bahrain: 2025 Snapshot\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business district. and Forbes Business, Bahrain‚Äôs non-oil GDP expanded by 4.9% in 2024, outpacing most Gulf rivals. This is largely due to a surge in fintech and logistics companies relocating to Bahrain Bay, drawn by liberal business regulations and a transparent tax system.\
GDP Growth Projections: Government analysts expect continued growth between 4-5% through 2025, buoyed by fresh investments in the Seef District‚Äôs new technology park and ongoing regulatory reforms.\
Business Optimism: A Gulf News survey published in March 2025 revealed that 71% of company executives in Bahrain plan to expand in the next two years, citing ‚Äúregulatory clarity‚Äù as a top driver.\
Why is it so attractive?\
- Low operational costs relative to Dubai or Riyadh\
- 100% foreign ownership allowed for most sectors (see more on eligible activities here)\
- Strong infrastructure support‚Äîespecially in Bahrain Bay and Seef District\
- Fast-track company formation processes\
Bahrain's business ecosystem is curated for seamless company setup and robust compliance, yet the regulatory bar has just been raised with the DMTT.\
What Is the Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT)?\
Importantly, the 2025 DMTT is Bahrain‚Äôs answer to global tax harmonization, aligning with the OECD‚Äôs Pillar Two framework‚Äîa direct response to international pressure for a minimum 15% effective corporate tax rate.\
Key Features of the DMTT\
\
Applies to multinational enterprises (MNEs) with consolidated revenues of EUR 750 million or more (about BHD 304 million)\
Ensures Bahrain-headquartered MNEs pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, regardless of local incentives or exemptions\
Aims to prevent profit-shifting and base erosion to jurisdictions with lower taxes\
\
\
‚ÄúIf your Bahrain company is part of a global group meeting the revenue threshold, or planning to scale fast, you‚Äôll need to engage in new reporting and compliance‚Äîthe days of zero-tax comfort are gone for larger players.‚Äù\
(I personally ran into a scramble in early January 2025 when our international legal counsel flagged the draft DMTT rules‚Äîfortunately, we had a strong in-house accounting team.)\
\
Who Needs to Pay Attention?\
\
Large groups: Mandatory compliance if part of a multinational structure\
Growth-stage SMEs: Worth monitoring if scaling toward the revenue threshold\
Investors and founders: Need to factor DMTT into due diligence and tax planning\

3. Cost of Compliance\
- Larger outlays for tax advisory and auditor fees, particularly for companies above the DMTT threshold\
Insider tip: If your entity is below the DMTT size, routine Sijilat registration and MOICT filings still suffice‚Äîbut as your business scales, consider an annual review with a seasoned Bahrain-based tax advisor.\
Ownership Structures: Still Favorable\
\
Alt text: Professional handshake at business agreement meeting in Diplomatic Area Bahrain.)\
- Easy transition from sponsorship to direct ownership as you scale\
- Simple nominee arrangements for regulated activities\
Surprisingly, even post-DMTT, Bahrain remains markedly friendlier than the UAE or Saudi Arabia for foreign control and profit repatriation. (I‚Äôve helped several clients transition from a UAE setup to Bahrain, cutting annual compliance costs by up to 40%.)\
Step-By-Step: Company Formation in Bahrain Post-DMTT\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation‚Äîpaperwork in a modern office.\
- Choose between SPC (Single Person Company), WLL (With Limited Liability), or B.S.C. (Closed or Public)\
- If you're new to Bahrain, SPC or WLL is fastest‚Äîprocessing in as little as 5 business days for straightforward sectors\
Step 2: Approvals & Name Reservation\
\
Register your intended name via the Sijilat portal\
Pro tip: Avoid using generic trade names‚Äîchoose distinct combinations for faster approvals (I waited 2 weeks on a generic submission, but only 48 hours when I got creative with a Seef District reference.)\
\
Step 3: Sijilat Licensing (CR Registration)\
\
Prepare your commercial registration documents (guide here)\
Obtain sector-specific approvals from MOICT or Central Bank for finance entities\
\
Step 4: Open a Bahrain Bank Account\
\
Choose Al Salam Bank or Bank ABC for reputation and digital account management\
Minimum capital deposit for most setups: BHD 1,000‚Äì5,000\
\
Step 5: Secure Physical Office Address\
\
Lease confirmation required‚Äîpopular districts: Bahrain Bay, Seef District\
You can use virtual offices for low-cost setups, but premium addresses in Bahrain Financial Harbour help with investor credibility (I‚Äôve found fewer queue delays at Bahrain Bay EDB counters, especially early mornings.)\
\
Step 6: Visa & LMRA Registration\
\
Apply for investor and employee visas\
Budget BHD 172 per work permit, plus medical and insurance fees\
\
Step 7: Tamkeen & EDB Incentives\
\
Apply for grants via Tamkeen for tech or export businesses\
EDB concierge can expedite documentation for foreign founders\
\
Shortcuts: Prepare digital copies of all shareholders‚Äô IDs, lease, MOA in advance; batch-upload to the Sijilat portal to skip in-person verification bottlenecks.\
Full process breakdown: Bahrain company formation procedure.\
Cost Considerations: What Does DMTT Mean for Your Budget?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs‚Äîcalculator money business finance.:\
- MOICT fees (company registration): BHD 200‚Äì450\
- Legal drafting and notarization: BHD 50‚Äì150\
- Office rent (per annum): BHD 1,000‚Äì12,000 (varies by district)\
- Annual CR renewal and basic accounting: BHD 350‚Äì1,200\
- DMTT-specific compliance (if applicable): BHD 2,000+** for MNEs\
\
For a complete breakdown by business type (including free zones and sponsorship), see KeyLinkBH‚Äôs cost guide.\
\
Secret tip: Starting in Diplomatic Area? Schedule CR renewals mid-morning on Wednesdays‚Äîqueues are shortest, and you‚Äôre more likely to catch MOICT supervisors in a receptive mood post-majlis. (I once saved three hours using this strategy!)\
Compliance, Reporting & Practical Tips Under DMTT\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation‚Äîcontract signing in Bahrain.)\
- Automate documentation‚Äîuse Xero or Zoho Books for instant reporting exports (I switched to Zoho in 2024 and cut quarterly audit prep time in half)\
- Schedule pre-filing reviews every December‚Äîavoid the January rush\
Challenge: Missing a single deadline with LMRA or MOICT can mean a freeze on your commercial registration. (It happened to me in 2023‚Äîhad to rush a last-minute letter from my landlord to prove active operations. Digital lease copies saved the day.)\
Common Mistake & How to Avoid It\
Many founders underestimate the importance of local ‚Äúsubstance‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs not just about an address, but real activity (employees, meetings, physical documentation) in Bahrain. To avoid trouble:\
- Maintain up-to-date employee records with LMRA\
- Keep clear minutes of board meetings (majlis notes, even in informal settings, are admissible)\
- Retain all regulatory correspondence‚ÄîBahrain‚Äôs MOICT can request backdated records\
Bahrain Company Formation vs. Neighboring Jurisdictions: A Sharp Contrast\
UAE and Saudi Arabia offer scale and deep markets, but Bahrain consistently ranks higher for speed and transparency of setup. Free zone benefits, like no currency restrictions and 100% repatriation, are now matched (and often exceeded) in Bahrain‚Äôs free zones.\
Quick comparison:\
- Typical company registration in Dubai: 2‚Äì6 weeks (plus higher compliance deposits)\
- Bahrain: 1‚Äì2 weeks for most sectors, lower capital requirements\
Insider Tangent: The Coffee That Saved My Business\
At first blush, this might sound unrelated. I once sealed a deal in the Seef District not in a boardroom, but over a tray of strong Bahraini qahwa, poured during a Ramadan sunset. That unexpected gesture built trust which later translated to expedited regulatory sign-off with a senior MOICT official‚Äîreminding me that culture and compliance are intertwined in Bahrain. Know the customs, and the business doors open more easily.\

Office Selection\
\
Choose Bahrain Bay for tech: faster internet setup, walkable to EDB and LMRA\

And right now as of 17:18, a bouquet of dried roses and baby‚Äôs breath just randomly fell off my wall. There‚Äôs no fan, no air, no changes, no movements or anything that could‚Äôve moved it and it very dramatically fell. I‚Äôve been working on courage and self love a lot, into my cup of coffee and meditations, and this happens when I‚Äôm gentle and composed in the face of anger. I didn‚Äôt yell back or curse like he did, I just asked him to leave my car and that his opinions are his opinions. 

What do you think this means? 

TLDR: got into an argument with an ex friend last night. Next morning praying mantis appears on my window (inside) and a bouquet of flowers falls just now.",2,1758589736.0,BabyWitch,0,1.0,False

I did my 4+2 in the Army and picked up two ArComs and a foreign commando badge. My Dad served 24 years in the USAF and has gifted me a collection of coffee mugs commemorating certain ComSec activities and deployments in the Far East. I also have a number of challenge coins that are applicable to my question.

Dad is the youngest of a large family (he's 83 and the last one). I have many service, unit, and rank ribbons, medals and patches dating back to WWII, including two from the CCC, before then.

I also possess an original M2 artillery compass with leather case I purchased on consignment from a retired (now deceased) dentist in Illinois who was gracious enough to reply, in detail, to my inquiry about his service (it's a rollercoaster of emotions). The provenance is impeccable and I have purchased a unit patch with the intent of creating a shadow box with the compass, his hand-written letter, a typed transcription, and the patch.

My intention is to honor all of this, everyone's service, with names, branch of service, dates of service, and campaigns. But I'm lost in the swamp. It's all so much. I don't think even a 4x8 panel of luan covered with plexiglass would work? And there's the issue of conservation, protection from UV light, oxygen, moisture, etc.

I guess I should be asking this question in an art historian forum? But I thought some of you might have done or experienced something similar to what I'm proposing and might be able to guide me.

He just started a side business on top of our farm job we work together, and while we were out at coffee tonight talking with another member of the business he said ‚ÄúI want to make so much wealth from this job that I can give 90% of what I make to the kingdom of god and me and my family can live off the other 10%‚Äù
It took me a minute to understand what he was taking about but when I finally did it really upset me, I didn‚Äôt bring it up till we got home but he already gives SO much of his time and tithes to the church as it is and now he wants to give even more, I‚Äôm not an avid church goer by any means I stopped going 3 months ago because I felt I was losing him to the church, I feel he puts church and serving above me and our daughter and it‚Äôs caused a huge strain on our marriage, has anyone else gone through this?

Most days I love having a nice replica of pour-over coffee with complex flavors and artisan beans. But there are days when I have to get up at 5am and I just want a strong basic cup of cheap coffee. We buy Jose's Dark Roast from Costco for this very reason but I've found the closest I can come to a decent cup of coffee with cheap beans is to use a variation of the cold-brew recipe and then heat it up in the microwave.

With cheap beans you don't really want a separation of flavors. There is no ""complexity"" you want to bring out in the cup. So for these scenarios where you just want a cheap cup of good and strong coffee, which profile are you going with?

I've tried asking the GPT plug-in but it doesn't have reference data in the spreadsheet for this scenario and it ends up basing it on other dark roasts that do have nice beans.",2,1758589267.0,FellowProducts,3,1.0,False
1no3x2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1no3x2v/the_great_dish_debate_of_24/,The Great Dish Debate of '24,"I was ready to highkey lose my mind over a single, crusted-over saucepan. It had been sitting on the stove, staring me down, for three days straight, a monument to Liam's epic forgetfulness. Maya, our resident clean freak, had already left two passive-aggressive notes on the fridge: first, a subtle ""Kindly wash me?"" then a more pointed, ""Is this pan a permanent fixture now?"" Honestly, I couldn't even blame her. The vibe in our urban apartment, usually pretty chill, was starting to feel‚Ä¶ sticky.

It wasn't just the pan, though that was the catalyst. It was the accumulating stack of mugs next to the sink, the mysterious crumbs on the counter that no one claimed. I used to think I was pretty chill about house stuff, but seeing that saucepan for a fourth morning while trying to make coffee, I realized I was lowkey simmering with resentment. NGL, I even considered just putting it in Liam's bed. But then Sam, our ever-calm mediator, walked in, saw my face, and just sighed. ""Dish crisis again, huh?"" he mumbled, grabbing a banana.

That evening, during our usual Tuesday night takeout ritual, I decided enough was enough. ""Okay, so, can we talk about the kitchen situation?"" I blurted out, before anyone could even finish their first bite of pad thai. Liam immediately looked guilty, Maya braced herself, and Sam just nodded, like he'd been waiting for this moment. ""I know we're all busy,"" I continued, ""but it feels like some of us are doing all the heavy lifting, and it's getting‚Ä¶ messy. Literally.""

Liam, to his credit, didn't get defensive. ""Yeah, no cap, I know I'm bad with the dishes sometimes. My bad, guys."" Maya chimed in, ""It's just, like, when you leave things, it kind of snowballs, right? And then I feel like I'm always the one picking up the slack."" Sam, ever practical, suggested, ""What if we just got a chore chart? Or, like, a rotating kitchen duty schedule? Something to make it less‚Ä¶ arbitrary."" We batted around ideas for a bit, laughing as we remembered past roommate dramas we'd heard from friends. Finally, we settled on a simple rotating 'kitchen lead' role each week, responsible for general tidiness, not just their own mess. That's so valid, I thought.

The next morning, the saucepan was gone. Washed, dried, and put away. It felt like a small victory, but honestly, it made a huge difference. The tension lifted, replaced by a renewed sense of shared responsibility. We even started leaving each other funny notes on the chore chart. It turned out, a little honest communication and a clear plan were all we needed to turn a sticky situation into something that actually brought us closer. We still had our quirks, but now we had a system, and more importantly, a stronger sense of being a team. We love to see it.
