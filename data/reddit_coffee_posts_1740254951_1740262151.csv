1ivufq1,https://i.redd.it/gogdljaikrke1.png,Did you know? The speedy syrup from Valen's clinic actually lasts for 4 hours!,"I've played like 200 hours of this game and just found this out today out of curiosity! Initially I wanted to know how long the coffee speed boost lasts and turns out it's also 4 hours, so it's way more economical to buy them at the market for 100T. I thought that the massive price difference between coffee and the supposedly only 2hr speedy syrup was really weird, and it turns out it's still really weird but not as bad as I thought lol Valen manages to simultaneously undersell her product and way overprice it!

And if you're curious about the Restorative Syrup and other restorative foods, they do last for 2 hours, giving you +5 HP and stamina every 10min or so, for a total of +55 HP and stamina.",1,1740262035.0,FieldsOfMistriaGame,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1ivuaig,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ivuaig/what_did_i_get_myself_into/,What did I get myself into???,"Hi friends! 
I (35f) have been friends with this guy from work (33m) for a few years now. Our friendship actually started out pretty weird, because he was always in my DMs pestering me while I was trying to focus on work, but eventually I gave into his friendship when hard times fell on him and I just felt bad. You see, I really do like helping people out if I can, and lending and ear is pretty simple, you know? But eventually us chatting back and forth on Teams via typing eventually turned into calls on Teams (for simplicity’s sake cuz I needed type emails n stuff for my job) and it suddenly became an almost daily occurrence. I found out we had a bunch of stuff in common, like games and anime and we really just bro’d it out and vibed. It was cool! I enjoyed it!

He opened up to me at one point, about how his girlfriend of almost 5 years, who he had been living with for almost 3… didn’t have sex with him. Now remember, I like to help and I have a lot of knowledge about sexual stuff so I started asking questions to try and help. We would have lengthy discussions about this and that and the long and short of it was… they had attempted to have sex once, but once he got the tip in, she flinched and hard noped on out. Since then, it has never been attempted. Nothing has. No touching of any sort.
I was absolutely baffled! How could you live with someone you love like that and never touch??? Like I get she clearly had something up with her vagina (which she seriously needed to get checked out) but… hands and mouth still work? So I suggested maybe she could be A-Sexual but he wouldn’t believe me. We sort of left it there… remember this because this will come back later.

Now, I also have a boyfriend whom I’ve been with for almost 10 years. We are very happy and I want for not. Our sex is great and there are no issues anywhere! 

At one point, after doing some overtime together, I got drunk and we started talking about our sexual stuffs in the past. You know, like ex’s n stuff. How we lost our virginities… etc etc etc. I apparently got super descriptive on my part, more than usual, cuz I was drunk and also usually when we talk we’re at work and we were not. In fact, this was the first time we had ever talked outside of work! This “awoken” something in him… and this has a double meaning. Firstly, the discussion aroused him (which made sense) but secondly, after he got off the phone call with me to take care of his situation… apparently he came “gallons”. He hasn’t realized how sexually repressed he had made himself, being with a girl who didn’t ever wanna talk about sex or ever want to touch him and now, talking to a girl who was more than happy to talk about it just… made him explode? 
I then found out the next day (because he told me)… that he has been very attracted to me for a very long time. Both my personality and how I look. So when he rubbed one out that night… it was to me, not in general and that’s essentially what caused the “gallons”.

Ima be totally honest. I was shocked. I was confused. I was also pretty flattered because why wouldn’t I be? I mean, I guess some girls would be like “ew gross” but that’s not how I am. Now, full disclosure, this dude has just been my bro this whole time. I never saw him as anything besides someone who bro’s out at work with me.. so to think now that he thought of me this whole time in THIS light was… different.

There was also another thing that drunk phone call night that I’d like to mention. He asked me, in a very serious tone right before letting me know he had to go take care of his physical problem… “Why do you like me?”
This sounds very innocent and boyish, and it is but friends, it’s the WAY he asked it. Even though I was drunk, I picked up on it. He sounded like… sad and desperate. Like if he wanted me to shower him in praise and affection. It’s like something you ask your crush. Either way, I answered him truthfully lol “cuz you’re nice and cool to hang with sometimes??” Cuz what else would I say??
This matters later.

So at this point in our story, we know Josh (we’ll call him that) is very attracted to me, has literally no sex life with his gf of many years whom he lives with, and has now experienced like one of the best orgasms ever rubbing one out to me and has TOLD ME AS SUCH. Whats a girl like me to do? Here is the thing, he knows my personality very well. Verrrrry well. Too well, one could say… and I immediately resulted to teasing him about it all because it’s fun. I don’t mean teasing as in like, a mean way? I mean in a playful way. What I didn’t know at the time, was that… he enjoys that too. And for the next 3-4 ish days, we fed off of each others in this way. So our bromance no longer existed anymore and now turned into this toxic chemistry that idk what to call tbh.

One night, I’m playing D&D with my friends, Josh begins texting me (something he suddenly started doing more often which was whatever to me). It was regular in the beginning. We shared memes and chatted about whatever but as the night went on… he had other objectives in mind. He wanted to sext me. I was like no sir, but he kept pushing it. He knew we had sexual chemistry at this point and was like yeah let’s just do it. Now, once again I have to point out, I like to help people out and IN MY HEAD I was just helping relieve his sexual frustrations that had been built up over many years. I felt bad for him and his situation!!! Also, I think this is a good point to add that I am polyamorous and my boyfriend knows and understands this, therefore if such a situations arises where another person comes into my life and in our fold, I must obviously ask for permission. So, since Josh kept insisting and I felt bad for him… I asked for permission. My boyfriend gave me the okay but gave boundaries. Basically said we could do whatever we wanted over the phone but he didn’t really wanna know details cuz it weirded him out. I said okay but even then, I didn’t wanna sext my friend. I basically had him make do with just sexual conversations where he could imagine himself in and rub himself out to that. Towards the ending of it tho, he wanted me to tell him (or text him, rather) that I wanted him and… in that moment it sparked something in my brain. It made me realize how much I was actually enjoying it all and so I did tell him it, and that I meant it. I NOW regret doing this.

It took about 3 days later for him to bark up my tree again. Christmas Eve. It started off texting at first, which was fine but then he kept insisting on calling me. I didn’t want this cuz idk weird? But, after insisting for a while of course wanting to hear my voice… I gave in. He called me and pretty much everything that would have been texted was just spoken. Ima be honest, it was sorta weird. And uncomfortable for a few reasons. Like, it was Christmas Eve and he had just finished cuddling his girlfriend to sleep and then pushes to call me for… this?? And also it was seeming like he wanted something akin to phone sex but it’s not what I was willing to give at all. The whole situation just felt odd. Either way, the second fappening happened.

3 days later… he came knocking at my phone again. He wanted to call me straight away and I still didn’t want to, but I let it happen since it already did once. This time though, and I’m sure you’re expecting it since it’s a theme here, he pushed for more again. He wanted me to participate. I was like dude no. But he insisted that it didn’t feel right he was the only one feeling good here. I understood what he meant but I just didn’t feel comfortable doing that. I explained I was only doing all of this to help him in his situation, and I didn’t really need help with anything. Still, he kept pushing… and the more he pushed, the more fuzzy my brain got about it all. I gave in. This is an ongoing theme, and yep, it’s toxic. 

Now things start to get a bit messier… if you didn’t think they were already.

Once again, my boyfriend has always know everything about everything but his girlfriend has never known a single thing. I had tried to convince him to just talk to her, but he wouldn’t. Like try to talk about their relationship in general, and how they were basically just roommates that kiss and cuddle sometimes and that’s it. About how he wants more, but also if he couldn’t get more from her because she was very clearly A-Sexual, a talk about how they should proceed was needed. He obviously needed more, and even if I stopped doing… whatever this was, he’d eventually do it with someone else or maybe even find someone local to him and straight up have sex. It was only a matter of time. He should just talk to her about it all and ask to somewhat open their relationship so everyone could be comfortable. I know, it’s easy for me to say… I get that. I am polyamorous and I’ve been with someone who understands and accepts me for ages! But man, just be open and honest! At this point, they’ve both been living a lie in their relationship and it was only gonna get worse!! 

Josh ended up opening up some sorts of dialogue with his girlfriend that weekend, and I think alcohol helped but she agreed to let him touch her a bit. So.. he fingered her a little bit and that was that. Still no reciprocation, or anything more. Thing was, after this little advancement in their relationship, he felt… really fucked up. Towards everything. Towards me, towards her, towards everything and then proceeded to completely ghost me for 3 days. I know that doesn’t sound like a lot, but when we talked daily for basically months… and I’m the type of person who gets neurotic when there is a change in dynamic, ya I was stressing on the other end and knew none of this.

You see… I had messaged him during those days and was just ignored. And I hate being ignored. What makes things worse for me was I could already predict what was going to happen because the next day we worked together was his birthday. He was gonna pretend like nothing happened, make some bullshit excuse and act all happy, while I was absolutely upset. This is exactly what happened. I woke up on that morning to a text for him being like “oh wow I never got any of these notifications” and when we got in our usual Teams call, he acted like nothing was wrong. It was his birthday and I wanted to rip him to shreds but I couldn’t cuz… it was his birthday. I held it in for I think 2 hours? But he kept asking me what was wrong. Poking me about it… he wanted me to explode and eventually I did. I confronted him about it all, and he eventually he told me the truth. I told him I was pretty confused because why would fingering his girlfriend cause him to ghost me? Like, I wanted to cheer for him cuz that was a great step so wtf was his problem?? I didn’t realize it yet… the big glaring elephant in the room. Either way, I said my piece, he apologized and we made up. We continued the day as normal and I bought him pizza.

Him advancing a bit with his girlfriend did make him think about reevaluating us, though, and about a week later, during a particularly tough fucking day for me at work… he wanted to have a “talk”. In the biggest, most dramatic fucking telenovela way, he basically… broke up with me??? Despite the fact we weren’t dating and no feelings of any sort were ever established and he knew full well I was only ever doing stuff to help him. It… was so weird. And so dramatic. Like his tone, the pauses… it was like he was trying to win an award and, meanwhile, I was wanting to punch the shit out of my computer because all of my systems were failing and now was NOT THE TIME for his bullshit! In the end, I was like yeah sure whatever! I never asked to do sexual stuff with you! I just went along with it to help out but if you wanna stop, that’s fine! Like you could have just stop asking to do stuff with me and I wouldn’t have known the difference!! 
Again… big glaring elephant in the room that was going unnoticed by me.

Now, up to this point, he’s absolutely been the toxic person who has been pushing and pushing and causing most of the issues here. But you see… after his weird fake break up with me, it got in my head and it made me mad. It shouldn’t have, but it did. I didn’t want to do any of those things, but I did. Yes, part of me enjoyed them too but like, he started all this weird messy shit and then… takes it away?? Yeah I decided it wasn’t fair to me, and I know how stupid that sound. I do. You don’t have to tell me.

A few weeks later, his girlfriend was going on some work trip which had been planned months ahead. We had known about it long before we even started doing the weird friends with benefits thing. We had planned though while she was gone, we’d play video games together and drink and just be cool buds. I still wanted to do this, even after all this messy stuff now, cuz why not, we’re still friends, right? 

After a particularly gnarly fight between us during that week (I don’t remember what it was about, only that he was being a dick to me and another coworker and we both told him about himself) I had decided that night was the night we’d make up and play games and drink. Problem for me was, I couldn’t drink cuz my boyfriend forbidden it since I got trashed accidentally then night before (I forgot to eat and drank a whole bottle of wine myself). So, I just pretended to drink with him. We played online uno, he drank whiskey and I drank regular seltzer waters and pretended they were spiked. He believed me cuz I’m good at pretending, I guess. My goal, cuz I decided to be a toxic vindictive bitch, was to convince him to do phone stuff with me once more on my behalf. What I didn’t know was… a drunk Josh is hella ADHD and keeping him on topic or task is near impossible. I tried to drop a few seeds in his brain and he just swatted them away cuz ooo look shiny object, and I gave up early on. I was like whatever. However… apparently they did stick and once he sobered up like 3 hours later, he suddenly told me that I was “very tempting”. At this point, I had NO idea wtf he was even talking about. It was like 2am, I was tired and getting ready to go to bed. He told me he never actually wanted to stop doing stuff with me, but he felt he had to. He still found me very attractive and alluring and wanted more of me. I was like “Oh!” And was surprised that my seeds apparently did take root… or maybe they didn’t and this was just all him? Idk and it didn’t matter either way, cuz I was still going to get my way. I told him I understood, however I felt it only fair we do it once more because I wanted to. He was iffy about it, but we promised it would be “the last time” and thus, it happened…. However there is one extra thing to note here…
Before we got off the phone that night… he stopped, said my name and then said “I appreciate you” in the exact tone one tells someone they love them.

Now… I saw the elephant in the room. Now I understood everything a lot more. He had told me in the very beginning everything was all lust. Everything was just for help. I was just a friend with benefits and nothing else but that wasn’t true at all. 

I didn’t really know how to respond to him, so I just told him I also appreciated him, and we hung up. I had a lot of think about….

It’s also very important to note that, Josh and many of my other friends… would no longer be working with me soon. You see, our company decided “fuck remote workers” and we’re laying them off at the end of the month. I had planned for their last day to be lots of fun, with games n stuff for us all to play! 
And Jan 31st, play we did! Many stuck around until the end of their shift, but Josh and another friend stuck around until like 10:30pm! We played Cards Against Humanity and it was super fun! The other friend left to put her kid to bed, and it just left us. Sadness was high in the air, as he has to clean out his laptop and pack shit up and I promised I’d stay with him as long as he needed for all of that. 
Now, I understand that a lot of feelings can come out, especially if shit is heavy like that but I just sat and listened. And he had a lot to say. Not necessarily about our job or losing his job but about us. He got really serious and basically explained that, what I had finally realized was true. He loved me and had for a long while. He said he realized he had feelings shortly after our first sexual encounter via text but for sure knew he had real feelings after he managed to do more with his girlfriend. The guilt he had for the both of us was proof enough. He said that, in a perfect world, his girlfriend would just open the relationship and he could just be with the both of us… but since he knew that would never happen… he knew, in a parallel universe somewhere, me and him were together and happy.
I… didn’t really know what to say to all this. It was sweet. Honestly, it was. It made me really wonder about my own feelings too because I really did enjoy being around him more than I should, but was it actually feelings of love? I mean, I loved him as a friend but more? Again, he knew I was poly so… even now, I believe he was truly trying to just dig into me deeper. 

After he no longer worked with me, I knew things were gonna be difficult. And they were, and still are. We no longer have daily calls cuz we don’t work together, and he can no longer justify such communication with me like that. Also, remember, if changes in dynamic happen with me… I become neurotic. I worry something happened or I did something wrong. I warned him about this. He was aware but he kept telling me not to worry. We were still gonna text daily and send memes n stuff. 

This has not been the case… and for a good reason.

You see, Josh doesn’t typically text friends often at all. So, when he and I became good buddies (way before benefits), it struck his girlfriend as odd and she questioned him. He explained it was just me, his work friend. She was like oh, okay. No issues. But, she also saw us in call a lot. She asked him about it. Again, we were working and he explained it as such, and she was like oh, okay. No problems. I also noticed, especially in December and January (when the benefits were) she suddenly would come in his room and give him lots of hugs and kisses, when before she never did that before. I found it very cute! Truly! However, it was like towards the very very end of his working with me that my friend pointed out (cuz she was also in call with us) that it seemed his girlfriend was “marking her territory” with how she was doing it. I was like… hmm…

There is another important thing I failed to mention that has to do with this point. Remember, we work remotely so we live far from each other. Well… I happen to be taking a trip to pretty close to him to visit another friend. She’s the same friend who was on call and pointed out the territory marking. She lives about 2 hours from Josh, and I had been making plans to fly and visit her for a very long time. Naturally, he wanted to see me also, so I figured ya we could get coffee or something? 
Well… I bought the plane tickets and he immediately got all excited and told his girlfriend about my trip. She also seemed oddly excited to meet me. Without speaking to me at all, it was decided between the two of them that when I go to visit my friend Jill, he would pick me up… bring me over their house and we’d… all… hang…?? He ended up telling me this before his end of job, and I was like EXCUSE ME?? Like wtf?? He said this was the only way he could meet with me because how could he go have fun with me without his girlfriend? Like… as a fellow female with a boyfriend, yes, I do see the situation. I am not blind, but also… as someone part of this messy situation.. who the fuck thinks it’s a good idea to bring /essentially/ their mistress to their girlfriends house to fucking hang out?! It didn’t make any sense to me at all! Not only that, but I don’t drive due to medical issues. I would just be… stuck with them until either Jill could get me or he brought me back. I really wanted to back out, and straight up had a panic attack. I told my boyfriend about all of this, and was just confused about why this was even a thing??? He said it made sense to him why Josh would want this. As a guy, he said it was simple. “He wants the two people he likes in one room to admire, and also he probably wants to prove to his girlfriend that you’re safe and just a friend.”
During Josh’s last night working with me, after everyone had left, I did confront him about all of this and he did confirm my boyfriend was right. I explained he was a fucking moron and this was a bad idea. I did not want to do this, and didn’t it seem strange his girlfriend seemed excited to suddenly meet me??? Also, apparently she has some severe public view of affection issues. Like despite the fact she doesn’t touch him sexually, she just makes out with him all over the place in public, and when guests are over, sits on his lap and basically dry humps him. Like bro, why the fuck would anyone wanna visit and deal with that?? No wonder friends stopped visiting you!! Big no thanks!! Now, the original plan is just getting coffee and hanging for a few hours is back on without his girlfriend because that’s what normal fucking friends do. Of course… his girlfriend doesn’t know that, yet.

Back on the original topic, which you can clearly understand now, his girlfriend is obviously suspicious of something. As of right now, I don’t know if she suspicious of him liking me? Or of us? But it’s of something.

Let us continue our story though, because this is outright somewhat addressed.

Beginning of February (this month) suddenly, his girlfriend announces she has to go on another work trip. The week of Valentine’s Day. I, personally, find this a little odd because… usually work trips are planned well in advance and not a few weeks in advance?? But either way, that was going to be a thing. Right before she left though, they got drunk and he, very stupidly, thought he was being playful and said he was so sad she was going and felt “she probably just liked one of her coworkers more than him” and she was like “really??” And looked at him obviously. He was confused, because he’s a moron, and she said “I suspect you and OP way more”. He realized the hole he dug, said “Whaaaat???” And…. Just left it at that. And she didn’t press the subject at all. :|

So she leaves on her trip, and Josh decides that he and I should have another drunk Uno night. I was actually pretty excited about this because I hadn’t been on call with him in like 2 weeks, and our texting had been pretty sparse because… well, he wasn’t trying to draw attention to us by his girlfriend. Again, I have to point out, we are just friends, and all benefits have even stopped and it had been over a month since we had even done that. I had also evaluated my feelings and understood that no, I didn’t have feelings for him but rather, I just liked the feeling of helping him. Like, it would give me a certain kind of high, and I liked that. So yeah, it was pretty annoying to me that having a regular friendship with him was becoming difficult because he kept hiding our friendship? Anyway, drunk uno night part two.
It was a good time, and I was allowed to drink this time and not pretend! We played as many games as we could until my computer seized up since its old as hell, and we eventually had to give up. We were sorta drunk and playing like shit anyway. After our buzz started going down, we just sorta chatted about whatever and then… he said his usual line he always used before initiating benefits. I was like wut? I thought you said we weren’t doing that anymore?? Oh, I’d also like to mention this was the first time we were ever on FaceTime call outside of work. Idk if that matters but it probably does. He told me that it made him happy that I was respecting his boundaries… but I was like “but you are just gonna cross them when it’s convenient for you, as always?” And he was like ya, basically.
Now, I was given a very important decision. I could tell him no. He set these boundaries. I know I didn’t outline them very well in this story but throughout the last 2 months he kept outlining boundaries for us and walking all over them but forcing me to stay within them. It was very very annoying and unfair. They were only for me, and never for him. The lines were always so blurry. I could very well uphold these stupid fake boundaries on principle….. 
or, I could give in, and say fuck it. The first 3 times we did stuff, I had essentially been pressured into it. The 4th time I had nudged him to do it but I know in my heart that it was just a power play on my end, so that’s on me. But this time? It felt different. It felt like if I said okay, it would be on an equal ground because I was finally comfortable with him.
So, I said okay. Let’s do it, fuck it. And so. We did. And it wasn’t like the other times either. It was actual, proper phone sex. I don’t know how to else to really explain it but it was…. Because we no longer worked together, we could finally properly use all that chemistry we had at work, on this phone call, to just fuel everything. It was genuinely a good ass time.
Afterwards, he let me know she had a bunch of other trips planned so, despite him being like “we’d never do this again” before, he owned up to the fact we probably would whenever she wasn’t home. This basically told me that they hadn’t progressed since that one time around his birthday. He had probably tried, failed, and given up once more. Porn was no longer doing it for him and he missed this connection. Since I NOW found enjoyment in it, I agreed this would be fine. Just so long as he understood that, once again, we are just friends. 

She came back from her trip a day before Valentine’s Day, and a huge fight occurred. I didn’t learn about it until much later but basically he obviously wanted to do romantic and sexual things with his girlfriend on Valentine’s Day and she didn’t want to. This obviously upset him and I can only assume what we had done only a few days prior fueled this. He wanted so desperately what we have but with his actual girlfriend but she just doesn’t want that. He flew into a rage. I don’t know a ton of details but he said he just started yelling and screaming about how it’s all so unfair. He said he screamed “Fuck you!” In her face a bunch of times and she just… calmly took it. He vented all his frustrations of everything at her and she just.. listened. And in the end, once again, agreed to go see an OB about her unusually painful vagina. 
After it cooled down between them, I guess he “then realized how much he really loved her” cuz of how understanding she was and how she was willing to try for him. This is what he told our mutual friend. And ya… all of that of awful on so many levels… 

Meanwhile on my end, he had told me after our drunk uno night, when she was coming home, and that they would obviously be spending the weekend together so he wouldn’t be texting me. Communication, wow. It’s crazy how useful that shit is. So yeah I was like okay cool, no worries friend. You go enjoy that shit with her! Thing was, all of this stuff was being said to our mutual on the weekend he was so busy, while she and I were working together. He also had told her how, suddenly, he wasn’t so sure about meeting me in person. He thought it was a bad idea now because he was afraid of cheating on his girlfriend (despite the fact we were just getting coffee and maybe pizza??? wtf???) and that… he wasn’t sure of his friendship with me anymore. He said he was afraid if he stopped his sexual relationship with me, our friendship would be over… but if he didn’t stop his sexual relationship with me, his actual relationship with his girlfriend would be over. I was fucking dumbfounded. Then he told our friend about all of our sexual stuffs but shaped it quite backwards. That I started it all, and was always barking up his tree, etc etc. I was beyond hurt by it all.

Next day, I was obviously still hurt, upset, fuming, etc. I wanted to confront him about it all but I also don’t wanna throw her under the bus about it. He and I were supposed to hang out, and so I told him we needed to talk. I… tried to talk to him about things but I just couldn’t. I was caught in my feels somehow because I was afraid. I know that seems really weird but let me try to explain…

You see, I need to meet him in person at this point. I strongly believe that if I do, it will break this weird sexy illusion of him in my head and I can just stop all of this. I know he isn’t my type physically and he hardly is personality wise either. The chemistry we have is mostly through bro memes and yes, we are definitely compatible sexually but we’ve never ever been physically together. This has happened with me a few times in the past. You get with someone online but then meet them irl and it’s just not the same. I want this to be the case here so I can just be like nah. He flip flops too much on what he wants in our friendship. The fake morals. The fake boundaries. One minute he says it’s all lust, the next he loves me. One moment we’re just friends but the next I’m a side chick, and sometimes I feel like an actual girlfriend. It’s fucking weird and confusing and I genuinely don’t like it. 

Anyway… knowing he we now considering breaking off our meeting scared me more than anything so as much as I wanted to flip out and tell him about himself, I couldn’t. Instead, I did explain I was feeling anxious about my whole trip in general and about hanging out. He reassured me of everything. He said everything would be fine, he’s super excited to meet and hang out with me. Since I knew his underlying fear was somehow cheating on his girlfriend (which still made no damn sense) I once again laid out our plans to him, just to make sure he wasn’t like… sneaking something else in there? And nope. Coffee, taking me to some local pizza place and then taking me back to my friends house. That’s it. And once again I pointed out how nothing between us is gonna happen, and he did get weird for a moment. I was like what?? Are you still seriously worried that you can’t keep your hands to yourself?? Like bro I understand you find me sexy af but if I say no, it’s still no, so I don’t see the problem. He said that he’s just all up in his head, that’s all. Right… 
He also wanted to let me know about the fight with his girlfriend, how he realized how much he loved her, etc etc, but also this made him realize he “never loved me since the beginning” and really always had been lust. Despite the fact all them glaring elephants make no sense, okay Jan. Whatever helps you sleep at night. I’m just like okay. 

This small hangout session we had (which did result in more happenings…) did not make me feel any better. Like, in the moment it did but like hours later it only made it worse.

I began to spiral. To make things worse, I became super sick with a head cold too, and once again he became super silent. 
Everyone around me kept telling me to just call things off. Meeting him, and honestly the whole friendship. 

And… I tried. A few days ago, another day we had planned to just hang out, I tried. Very similar to his birthday, I did my best to stay strong but this time it wasn’t him, it was mostly cuz I was still trying to figure out what to say. I also knew, from mutual friend, he had initially planned to bail on our plans because his girlfriend decided to work from home that day. Again, we are just friends so why is he trying to hide our friendship so fucking badly???? He was just gonna play a video game and chat with me while I probably watched TV and vibed. I didn’t know about her suspecting us yet, he told me after our talk..
Once I got on call, he could hear my upset voice but ignored it. I only lasted maybe 30 minutes until I couldn’t anymore. I told him that I didn’t think I could keep this up, and I felt like less than a friend. I felt like I had become something like a dirty magazine he hide under his bed whenever someone was around. I was always someone of convenience ever since the beginning. At first, it was just someone to chat with at work but then, when he realized my type of personality type, he knew exactly how to get to me. He knew exactly how to push me, and did. This whole thing was toxic and I didn’t want anything to do with it anymore. I just wanted to be his friend but he was making it so hard.
He was baffled since I seemed fine only a few days ago, but I was like yeah I was still keeping all this in because I didn’t want to jeopardize our meeting because it meant so much to me but now I wasn’t even sure if it was worth it. He told me it was ridiculous that I’d keep all this in, and that he’s told me so many times to just talk to him about these feelings, but how? How am I supposed to do that when I’m always hidden? He has no idea what it feels like to always be hidden cuz everyone in my life knows about him. He then said he understood that yes, it’s his fault for being a coward. If he would just talk to his girlfriend and confess everything maybe he could get rid of his guilt but he’s not ready to do that yet, and even so, if he does it before I fly down to where he’s at, it’ll look like he’s only confessing so he CAN do stuff with me irl. He said it would be too damming so he has to do it after I visit.
There was a lot said. I don’t remember it all but all I know is I finally flew off the handle. I confronted him about what he told our friend and how he shaped me to be some thirsty side hoe always hitting him up, when I only EVER initiated once and it was out of fucking spite. He denied it and said it wasn’t meant to sound like that. We argued about it until it was beating a dead horse. He wanted to die on that hill so I gave it up.
He said he did have reservations about meeting me but him telling our friend was just half baked cuz he was in his head. It wasn’t something meant for me to know, and this is why info shouldn’t be shared like that.
In the end, I was lulled into feeling okay and he apologized for making me feel like shit. He did confirm that a lot of our lack of communication, or miscommunication was due to his girlfriend being around and he didn’t want our chat always pulled up on his phone or computer because she was going to keep asking questions…. And that’s when he let me know she was suspecting something. He told me about his really stupid comment before she left. And I was just like wow why are you like this?? 

And this is so far where we are at. My trip is in a like 10 days. I am really fucking anxious still. I still truly believe he’s gonna find someway to bail or something.
I know that guilt is eating him away. He has almost confessed everything to her like twice but backs out because of fear. He doesn’t have a job, and she holds all the power. It’s her apartment, and she could easily kick his ass out. He risks a lot by telling her but… at the same, he got himself into this mess.

Now, you may be wondering how do I feel about his girlfriend. Don’t I feel bad??? I have gone through my own waves about this.
In the very beginning, I legit just saw myself as helping a buddy rub one out. Like I didn’t feel anything in particular. I didn’t see it as cheating even remotely.
After he got me to participate, I started feeling bad. This is when I tried to get him to confess the first time, but he wouldn’t. At this point,
I began collecting evidence of everything because if this dude continues to chicken out, I may just tell her myself. 
After he made a bit of progress, I was really happy for them but then I started questioning a lot… and then learning how she has NEVER touched him…? I’m sorry, but I’ve begun to feel less bad.
It’s like forcing a lion to be a vegetarian. He’s doing it because he loves you but it’s not natural for him and you’re delusional if you think it’ll last that way. I’m not putting full fault on her, obviously. Him keeping quiet about his suffering is just as bad but, how could she just assume he would never be hungry? Especially because he does TRY to be sexual with her still. You have to figure he will find food elsewhere eventually…. I’m sorry.
Currently… I don’t know how I feel. Now that I know she suspects SOMETHING, idk if she suspects us or just him liking me, but for her not to get on him about it??? It show me that she’s somewhat bothered but somewhat accepting of it. I don’t know. At this point… I just don’t know how to feel about anything.

I know this was a long story. I’ve been writing it for hours but I hope someone reads it. I’ve just been going through a lot and it’s wild because…. How did I even get here lol???",2,1740261645.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1ivuacl,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1ivuacl/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1ivua96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belize/comments/1ivua96/trip_recap_6d5n_san_ignaciotikalcaye_caulker/,Trip Recap (6d/5n) San Ignacio-Tikal-Caye Caulker,"I want to share the trip we just had in case people need some references. This forum has been a great deal of help for my planning:

**Day 1:** Landed in BZE and had arranged for a driver pick us up and drop us off at Log Cab Inn in San Ignacio. We had to wait for our mom to land 2 hours after us, so we grabbed lunch just outside the airport at Margie's. For 3 meals and 2 drinks, we paid $36 BZ. On the way to San Ignacio, we had some stops along the way - **Cheers** for snacks. 5 cookies and a small cup of soursop juice was $16 BZ, then to **ArtBox** for coffee, cake, and some souvenirs. The **Log Cab Inn** was alright -had to change cabins because of water issues and hot water was more lukewarm. Jenny at the front desk was super helpful and friendly. The food was good at the hotel resto. Be prepared to wait for an hour for your food. After 2 tiring days of adventure, it was reassuring to have an in-house resto where we can eat. Going downtown, you will need to ride a cab ($15 BZ each way).

**Day 2:** Day trip to Guatemala to visit Tikal. Our driver picked us up at 6:30 am and took us to the border. A guy who offers to exchange USD or BZD for Guatemalan Quetzals came up to us and we exchanged some cash but found that all the places we stopped at took credit cards, even the souvenir shops in Tikal. Anyway, our driver passed us on to a tour guide in the Guatemalan side, who was with us the entire time, except for the drive back to Belize since he lives closer to Tikal. On the way, we had breakfast at **El Portal de Yaxha** ($45 USD for 4 people) and then stopped at a store where we met with other people who joined us for the Tikal tour. There were 11 guests in total. Bring loads of water, a hat and insect repellant. The tour ended around 2:30 then had lunch at the resto by the entrance. We got back to the hotel around 5:45pm.

**Day 3:** ATM Cave Tour. Boy oh boy, this was fun! We were a group of 5 (2 adults, 1 senior, a 15-yo and a 10-yo). I prebooked through Viator, the provider was **Belize Caving Expeditions**. Lesson learned: book direct. It's waaaaay cheaper. We got picked up at 8 am but had to stop in downtown SI to get breakfast. Breakfast burrito as $3.75 BZ and fryjacks were $0.75 with protein already! 6 pieces of banana for $1 BZ!! Our guide was Edward who was so calm, patient and made us feel safe the entire time. My 15-yo has autism and I was pretty scared for him, especially that he has sensory hypersensitivity. Again, Edward was very patient and kind and thankfully, my son was was able to go through all the tight spaces and climbed over rocks. He's a good swimmer so no problems there. The senior on the other hand, chose to wear platform shoes (not really for hiking) and she managed just fine. We were the last group to go inside the cave which meant that we were not rushed and had the space all to ourselves when we finally reached the ""main attraction"". We finally got out of the cave around 4pm. Right at the parking lot, a lady had lunch prepared for us. It def hit the spot! This experience lands in our top 5. It was a fun, scary, and educational. This is a must-do in Belize. No pictures to prove we were inside, but it is what it is.

**Day 4:** Traveled to San Ignacio to Caye Caulker. We got picked up around 8:15am and just made it to the water taxi terminal to make it to the 10:30 AM trip. We checked in at Coral View hotel, where we were finally able to have a nice hot shower. This hotel has the conveniences we needed and the nightly rate was pretty reasonable. Solid hotel with a warm pool and a sunset view. It's one of the few taller buildings on the island. Then we headed to **The Pelican Sunset Bar** for lunch. Again, don't come suuuuper hungry because you will wait a while for your food. Came back here for the sunset later that day. Then, we had dinner at **Il Pelicano**. We just walked in and was able to get a table at 7:30pm. But highly suggest you reserve to make sure you get a table. Food was good! It was a nice break from Belizean food.

**Day 5:** Snorkeling with **Salt Life Eco tours**. Again, book direct! Got to the meeting point at 9am but we didn't  leave until close to 10. There were supposed to be 12 of us but ended up having only 7. Our guides were Philip and Jamar who were great. I brought my phone to take pics underwater but don't hesitate to ask for their Go-Pro. They send the pics and videos for free. I totally forgot and missed to ask them to take a video of me swimming with sharks. They maintain that compared to other tour groups, they are eco-friendly because they don't feed the animals. So, when you get to shark alley, be prepared to jump in the water right away or they'll swim back to the bottom when they realize there's no food for them. Food was chicken, rice and beans, macaroni salad, they served water and fruit punch. Towards the end, they served fruits too. We got back round 2:30 pm and went to **SipNDip** for lunch and drinks. It was the perfect spot to just chill.

We had dinner at **Swings** because they were one of the few that still looked popping at 9pm. We tend to eat  dinnert late. Food was yummy and great value! $75 BZ for 2 shrimp skewers, a whole lobster and grilled fish. Came with rice, coleslaw and alcohol.

**Day 6:** Took the 10:30 am water taxi back to Belize City. Our flight wasn't until 4:40 pm but our mom's flight was at 2:55pm and she wanted to get there early. I hate waiting at airports (unless it was Singapore) but had no choice because old people. Anyway, it literally, took us 10 minutes to get inside the waiting area. They have decent food inside the airport. A pulled pork sandwich is $21 BZ.

For reference, the 10:30am water taxi did not leave until 10:45 am and docked around 11:40am. We had to wait another 20 minutes for our luggage and then off to the airport. The trip was about 30 minutes.

Another tip is to bring cash for tips, food, tours (if you didn't prepay) and taxi rides. We brought cash which still was not enough so we had to withdraw from Atlantic bank. The exchange rate was straightforward. I withdrew $400 BZ and $200 USD was taken out of my CapOne account, along with the $8 atm fee.",3,1740261628.0,Belize,0,1.0,False
1ivu9nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1ivu9nb/comparing_kettle_against_fill_preheat_oh_this_is/,"Comparing Kettle against Fill Pre-heat (oh, this is so long)","Synopsis of my tests: 

1. Top-of-the kettle pre-heating results in chamber water that is 2C-8C warmer than is achievable using the fill/dump method.

2. The Pro2’s brew path includes coffee in a steel coffee filter that rests in a metal frame and, seen as a whole, the entire mass of the system quickly sucks off energy as hot water travels through it.



Experimental parameters: 

All tests were conducted at 780 meters elevation where water boils at 97.2C. (If you’re using your Flair in Denver, 1609 meters, water boils at 95C.)

Before measurements were observed, chamber contents were agitated with a wooden stir rod to eliminate gradients.

The Flair Pro2 chamber masses 450g (which is lots of steel). 

The chamber was allowed to cool to room temperature between the two tests. 





Over-the-kettle results: 

The open end of the Pro2 chamber was placed over the steam column rising from a Stagg kettle set to its elevation limit of 97C and allowed to sit there for 8 minutes.  

Chamber was removed from heat source, capped, and placed on work surface. This action took about 10 seconds to perform safely and is similar to the process of placing the chamber on the filter and placing the assembly in the frame. 

Poured 97C water into chamber.

Agitated the water with rod and inserted probe while observing ThermoWorks instant-read Thermapen. 

Maximum observed temperature of water in the chamber was 92C. Temp fell off and stabilized at 87C in 25 seconds. 

Emptied the chamber and filled a second time with 97C water. Maximum temperature after agitation was 93C and fell off to 88C in 20 seconds. 

if one was acting quickly to set the gauge and begin to pull the lever, it was conceivable to brew with water that was at or slightly above 90C. 





Fill-and-dump multi-cycle results: 

Following the kettle experiment, the chamber sat at room temperature for 30 minutes. 

Poured 97C water into capped Pro2 chamber.

Maximum temperature displayed after agitation was 74C. Temp fell off to 61C within 30 seconds.

Emptied chamber and quickly filled it a second time with 97C water. After agitation, maximum temperature in chamber was 85C, dropping to 78C in 20 seconds.

Emptied and filled chamber a third time. Maximum temperature after agitation was 89C. After 20 seconds temp dropped to 86C suggesting the steel was about as hot as it was going to get.

Repeated a fourth time. Max was 89C and stabilized at 88C for 12 seconds before beginning to drop off.

If one acted quickly, it was conceivable to brew with water that was at or slightly above 87C. More likely, water would be closer to 84C. 





Steel Coffee Filter test: 

With the coffee filter at room temperature and filled with 18g of coffee suitable for a 30 second pull, the steam pre-heated brew chamber was filled with 97C water. Working as quickly as was safe, the brew cycle was started with a 10 second pre-infusion. Temperature of the espresso stream was observed to be 65C, rising to a maximum of 72C midstream. 



After pre-heating the filter by pouring 97C water through it once, quickly drying it, and filling with 18g of coffee. The steam pre-heated brew chamber was filled with 97C water. Temperature of the espresso stream was observed to be 70C, rising to a maximum of 75C midstream. 





Opinions and conclusions: 

Three or four fill’n’dump cycles are required to achieve a brewing temperature that, at the very best, is 4C to 8C lower than what is achievable by pre-heating the chamber using the rising steam column of a kettle. Note that even the kettle results improved after a second fill of hot water. 



If one wishes to minimize temperature loss throughout the brew path, the entire system must be pre-heated including the coffee filter and the disk.



However, in the real world, using the kettle method does not necessarily mean one’s espresso will always be superior to that produced using the fill method. Allowing for ambient temperature in the work area, using either of these heating methods results in the 450g of steel settling at an equilibrium of 86C-88C in as little fifteen seconds or as much as forty seconds. The operator can easily spend 15 seconds to set the gauge, grasp the lever, and begin the pre-infuse phase. The dose of ground coffee and the filter are going to draw off 8C-13C, a significant heat loss. I do not know how much heat is drawn away where the filter contacts the cold frame but I’m sure it is measurable and therefore not trivial. 



I am left with the conclusion that it really doesn’t matter all that much which pre-heating method one uses. In the time it takes the espresso to fall, the water in the system can easily and quickly drop to 85-88.5C. The further loss of heat energy as water flows into the coffee and heats the filter cannot be ignored nor can it be compensated for signficantly by heating the chamber any further.





Not tested: Immersion. 

Water boils at the limit of location’s elevation but the bottom of the pan will get much hotter and can transfer that super high heat to the steel chamber. I’m not interested in testing this method but, seems to me, using a pan to pre-heat the chamber could easily melt the insulating jacket. 



endit:

I prefer darker roasts and Italian-style blends for espresso. I no longer have the palate to declare whether 4C-8C makes a sensible difference. If you can tell the difference in the cup, I bow. I leave it to you to choose the pe-heat method you enjoy or believe in.





For most Flair users, I should imagine performing three cycles of fill’n’dump is onerous and tedious. For me, however, it’s just part of the relaxing fun of watching the squirrels in the backyard while crafting three shots of delightful espresso.

Okay, so, disclaimer: I (38M) am not a big internet person. My friend, Dave, told me I should post here after I was venting to him about… well, everything. He said I was being an AH, but frankly, I think he’s just jealous of my successful career. So, I need unbiased opinions.

Basically, my wife, Sarah (36F), and I have been married for 8 years. Things used to be great. Really great. But lately, it feels like she’s just… let herself go. She used to be so ambitious! Now she just complains all the time.

Quick backstory: I work in finance. I work long hours, I bring home the big bucks. I’m talking six figures, bonuses, the whole nine yards. Sarah used to work in marketing, but after we had our daughter, Lily (6), she decided to be a stay-at-home mom. Which, fine. I supported it. I want the best for my kid.

Here’s where I think things started going downhill. Sarah seems to think being a SAHM is some kind of vacation. Don't get me wrong, I know it's hard, but I contribute too! I work my butt off all day, come home tired, and I still help with Lily. I'll play with her for 10 minutes before bed, I help with the dishes maybe twice a week!

But Sarah? She never seems to have any energy. She's always ""tired"" or ""stressed"" and she just wants to ""relax"" in the evenings. Relax? I'm working my butt off all day making sure we can afford our house, her fancy organic groceries, and Lily's damn expensive preschool, and SHE gets to relax? It's infuriating.

And the house! Don't even get me started. It's constantly a mess. Toys everywhere, laundry piled up, dust bunnies the size of small rodents. I come home after a long day and it's like walking into a disaster zone. I’ve brought it up to her, and I get the same excuses: ""I'm busy with Lily all day,"" ""I'm too tired,"" ""I'll get to it later."" Later never comes.

Also, she's gained weight. I’m not saying this to be mean, but it’s true. We used to go to the gym together, but now she just says she doesn’t have time. I mean, come on! If Beyonce has time to work out, so do you.

The final straw was last week. I had a huge presentation at work, the kind that could make or break my career. I specifically asked Sarah to make sure the house was presentable in case my boss wanted to come over afterwards for a celebratory drink (or commiseration, depending on how it went). I even offered to take Lily out for the day so Sarah had time to clean. She agreed.

I came home that evening, presentation a huge success, practically buzzing with excitement. I invited my boss over. And what did I find? The house was in the EXACT. SAME. MESS. There were pizza boxes on the coffee table, unfolded laundry overflowing from the basket, and Lily was running around in her pajamas even though it was 7 PM.

My boss gave me this look, like “Really, this is where you live?” I was mortified. Sarah just shrugged and said she “had a rough day.” A rough day? What does that even mean?

I admit, I lost it. I yelled. I said some things I probably shouldn't have, but I was just so frustrated. I told her she was lazy, that she’s let herself go, and that she’s embarrassing me. She started crying, Lily started crying, and my boss quickly made his excuses and left.

Now Sarah won’t talk to me. She’s been giving me the silent treatment for days. Dave says I’m being a jerk and that I need to apologize. But honestly, I don’t think I am. I think I’m just holding her accountable. Am I the asshole for expecting my wife to contribute to the household and not be such a drag?",0,1740261494.0,AITAH,3,0.25,False

There isn't much to do around here and I want to meet other people in their twenties or early thirties I just don't drink and I don't have the money to really be apart of all the art events. Plus I know there is a big board game community and I am just not very interested. I've asked on here before and no one really had a clear answer so I just thought I would ask again? Most coffee shops in town that would be populated close at 2pm on saturdays so I can't just sit around there but I have to get out of the house and do something without paying a ton of money. I'm not religious so I'm not going to meet anyone at church and I don't have children so family events around town are out. I know new places keep opening around so I just ask every once in a while to see people's opinions.

I know there are ways to be active but I just wish there was something for adults in town something that everyone can go to and just chill out and meet others. I know that is a tall ask but even a cafe or just a small place that is open all day? Restaurants aren't really places to just sit around in and most places with activities you would have a limited amount of time because of cost reasons. I know the mall is picking up but i still feel like people don't just sit around there anymore and if they do they usually aren't in the twenties to thirties age range.

The style of the animation feels very juvenile. This is most apparent in Episode 2 where the barista at the coffee place has a huge mouth and no nose, while the umpire has a completely different facial structure. It's silly and definitely something that feels aimed at children as colorful and silly. Also, the side characters are completely goofy and stand out in a weird way, like the all-knowing little boy and the school janitor.

But then, the story of both episodes are super depressing and mature. The first episode has a father using his daughter's softball team as a coping mechanism for divorce and an ending that doesn't really resolve the conflict for the daughter as introduced. As for the second episode, the umpire is a 32 year old who used to date a co-worker and is now trying dating apps for the first time. I don't know how many children are going to enjoy any of this.

I'm M28 and my ex is F28, we were together for around 6 years and met in high school. We  had an interesting relationship considering all these years we lived with our parents, never lived together, I continued school and worked, kept working after school, she just worked. Did not want to go to school. Now that I look back at it I was a shit boyfriend,  I was into gaming and prioritized gaming sometimes, ignored her for longer than needed, there were situations when i didnt want to drive somewhere because gas money etc, I said some hurtful stuff here and there, I won't go into details but let's say it was work and finance related, she was not a fan of work and comes from a fairly poor family as well. Anyway i was young and dumb and with time I fixed those mistakes. On a positive side I always loved her and supported her, never cheated. 

Long story short, I was not the best bf she was not the best gf but something kept us together for all those years. The damage was already done though.

At some point closer to the end of our relationship she started talking about not loving me the way she loved me before and that was the beginning of the end, she also got a new job around that time and that place had a lot of people and a lot of collegues, she told me about them as well. She mentioned a guy as well who was supportive and a good friend, lets call him Steve. To get to the point, I broke up with her realizing there is no future for us. We did not even meet for it, i proposed to meet, she proposed to take a break(over text) for a month or two and then talk perhaps and see what future brings. After first week or two she removed my nickname on the text app, after some more time I noticed that she unfollowed me and unfriended everywhere. It hurt but I it is what it is.

Now let's get to today. I broke up with her in the beginning of the last year. I got over, I think so at least. Sometimes i think about her but nothing major. Today out of the blue I decided to check her socials, i see a picture, who else but Steve is there with her. For a second I got that feeling like my soul left my body, but then I realize it's okay. We moved on, I understand why it didnt work out and i'm happy she found someone who is a better fit than me. However at the same time, Im wondering how fast did she move on? During one of our last talks she mentioned she met for a coffee with him, hurt at that time, dont think she would cheat on me though, but who knows.

Me? I purchased a brand new home, a car, Im healthy and have good friends, I have FWB, but no relationship. Overall i'm happy with my life. Yes it stings that she moved on, but it is what it is and I got to live my life. Will I find someone? Not sure, after those 6 years i did not talk to other women at all basically, so my game is shit. 

I will continue improving myself and see what life brings, hope she is happy with her life as well.",0,1740260613.0,BreakUps,0,0.5,False
1ivtsjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ivtsjd/i_need_a_males_perspective/,I need a male’s perspective,"Okay so to give context… I (27 F) have a very attractive boss (36 M) who is a single dad. I help him with his children in his home, just a few hrs a week. His children also attend a school where MY parents are their teachers. Sometimes I also help the children at their mom’s house (my boss’s ex). Strange situation right?

He is a very thoughtful, emotionally aware, sweet, caring man who has dealt with a similarly painful situation to mine- dealing with an abusive ex and long drawn out court battles. We have bonded a lot over sharing our emotions surrounding these experiences… he has been separated from his ex for 3 years (and has dated since). I have been separated from mine for 1.5 years. 

Here’s the thing. He also makes intense eye contact with me. Once I mentioned that I really like tea, and since then he has left out the tea kettle and boxes of tea for me (he’s even prepared it for me from start to finish before 👀), he has bought me food to have at his house, on Thanksgiving he brought my family and I a big delicious ham (probably to show thanks but still), and he has also given my family sausage from a wild boar that he personally hunted (holy shit can’t believe that happened haha). He supports me during rough patches with me having to share custody with my ex. He also hugs me every single time he sees me, at least once and sometimes more. I know this may be subjective but I genuinely feel that there is warmth and sweetness in these hugs from him- he is not disrespectful or feeling me up or anything lol, I think these hugs just stem from genuine affection. He also doesn’t hug my parents this frequently despite them being his children’s teachers, or other people I’ve seen him being friendly with/interacting with. There have been many mornings where we talk for 30 mins (even one morning we talked for AN HOUR about all sorts of subjects) when he obviously could just leave to get ready for work. He is a business owner so he won’t get in trouble for being late to work, but still! 

He’s also taken his shirt off in front of me before and come out shirtless LOL. Hasn’t done it in a while but yeah… he’s clearly comfortable around me. 

Obviously all of this combined has me feeling some type of way. I am really into him, and about a month ago I asked if he would ever want to hang out and get coffee or go on a walk, since my therapist suggested I get out more (this was after we talked about how we both are in therapy) and also bc I just genuinely enjoyed our conversation last time I had helped him. He said he also really enjoys our conversations and thinks it’s a good idea to get out in general, but that most of his free time is spent at the gym. He asked if we could “rain check” locking down plans. I just told him no problem, and that I understood bc I really am in the same boat. 

Anyway, he hasn’t mentioned making plans again since then! I guess I just want to get other perspectives (especially from men)… what is going on here? Does he like me? Is he just being friendly or nice to me? Do you think he will ever make plans with me and was his rain check a soft no? I’d love to hear your thoughts on this situation.

1ivts0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuttering/comments/1ivts0t/i_try_meldonium_and_it_significantly_cure_my/,I try Meldonium and it significantly cure my stuttering,"Hi everyone! 

I try to be short. Sorry my English, I'm from Russia. 
My doctor recommend me to try medicine for my stamina. Sometimes I feel so tired, and he say what I should try Meldonium. It's a medicine, what blocks something in cells, some metabolism thing, you can google it, and cells and body have more oxygen, and you feel more natural power. I try it, it's feels so great, for sport, and work, I feel mooore less tired and have so many power. 

AND

I noticed, what I'm like almost stop stuttering!
It's so strange, you're so calm, but not sleepy, I thing it's oxygen effect. And this feeling, scared, when you want to talk someone, it's gone. 

For me it's like very hard, to talk someone in the street, sometimes I can't say a word. But with Meldonium I feel like I'm a normal person. I can go to coffee shop and calmly said, Cappuccino and caramel syrup. Who stuttering, knows what letter C is hardest 😃. And my stuttering gone like on 80-90 %. I'm just like calmly speaking person, and sometimes I have little s-s-ttuter but it really almost gone. I can start a dialog, with zero stutter, ask a girl on street. It's crazy! I'm so glad about it. I don't know how, but it works. I use minimum doze - 250 mg. Just one pill in the morning. But recommend 2 , but for me 1 pill is good enough. 

If you try it and it helps you, I glad to hear your opinion. Meldonium in Russia it's no recipe drug. I don't know if this available in other countries. I know in sports it's like a doping, because who use it have better result. And our beautiful tennisist, Maria Sharapova use it too as well. 

Thank you, I hope it help somebody. Be careful with medicine, ask your doctor before this. It can have a side effects, and read instructions. God bless you all

1ivtrl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JudgeFirm9764/comments/1ivtrl0/breakfast/,Breakfast.,"9 am comes fast, but waking up to her, It didn’t matter, if I felt groggy and spent from the night before. I looked over at her and there she was looking just as exhausted but relaxed. I wasn’t going to disturb her. So I got up and started making coffee and eggs. Some time rolls by and she comes walking into the kitchen. “Ohh you already started cooking, what on the menu?” I said “nothing fancy, just eggs and toast. How do you like your eggs? Or do you even want any? She said “scrambled and fluffy. “ So I added a bit of milk and went to town. 

The trick with scrambled eggs is to not let them sit on the burner too long, gotta take it off and let the pan finish the cooking. 

After a bit of time I brought out her serving. She was shocked, “my ex and I never did this kind of thing, he could hardly do laundry correctly, let alone cook for me or himself 😂” 

I said “really? I grew up by myself so I learned young, small things like Mac n cheese, box dinners and stuff, parents were never home after school, so you teach yourself.” 

“Hah, I grew up like that too, I think a lot of us at our ages did.” 

“Yea mom was working a lot when I was young, then she started partying a lot with friends, I started paying bills at about 15. Since she could no longer afford them.” 

“Wow that’s quite a bit of responsibility at a young age, must have been stressful.” 

“A bit yea, but I was working nearly full time and left school, I was making money hand over fist for a while. Couple hundred on the weekends with just tips! I managed to become manager after about 1.5 years which was helpful, schedule making, ordering food etc.” 

“Well that’s pretty impressive and honorable for a young man, I bet the girls were all over you lol” 

“Not really, I had a couple of girlfriends, but I was not a stud by any means and I worked a lot so I didn’t have time to really date, hell I didn’t even have sex till I was almost 20.”

“Well even for a late bloomer I’m impressed. You learned quickly, I know you learned me quick.” 

“Heh well thanks, you make it kinda easy. Some girls are hard to figure out, but you made your intentions clear. I won’t go into specifics on how I know some stuff, but I’ve had practice” 

“lol yea you mentioned that, well if anything happens today, we’re gonna have to take it easy, I’m fairly sore” 

“Same, I could go a few rounds easy, but only at your pace.”

“Why are you like this?” “Like what?”

“Just like you have a way about you, You haven’t put any kind of pressure and reassured me at every whim.” 

“Well this is the age of internet dating, I think both sides need reassurance these days, I mean meeting someone online, then meeting up in person can be sketchy, Ive heard stories from both sides about bad encounters and stuff. I feel it’s even worse for the fairer of the sexes.” 

“True, I had a friend get catfished by a girl and he got played for a couple thousand, it’s definitely sketchy” 

“Ouch, I know that feeling all too well, I won’t get into it but I felt that pain” 

After a bit we were both done eating I grabbed the plates and cleaned up, she said she was gonna get in the shower quick. Before she left though she came in the kitchen and kissed me on the cheek. “I was hoping you can join me.” 

“I already planned on it, but after I gotta run back home and change clothes if you wanted to spend some time together this afternoon?” 

“It’s a date!” She said. I could feel my heart start to pound in my chest, a feeling of excitement rushed over me. It wasn’t lustful in nature either. It was one of relief. 

I rinsed off the dishes and hurried my butt back to the bathroom, the water was running and just as I poked my head in, there she was getting undressed, I chose to keep my mouth shut and just watch, she was beautiful I couldn’t help but stare, she was mesmerizing in the best ways. 

I finally came in and hugged her from behind. She embraced it, as my hands slipped around her waist, she grabbed on to my hands spun back around and lip locked me. “Hey there..” she said with a sly look in her eyes, I could feel myself getting erect, she could feel it too, she spread herself open a bit, and started grinding on me. It was clear she became instantly wet. We just stood there naked waiting for the water to be just right. A few moments pass by and we both got into the shower. “I like mine hot, I hope you don’t mind.” As I got in I could feel the water, yep typical lava temp. I played it cool and didn’t fully go under the shower till my body got use to it. “It’s just fine” I said with a bit of a wince and a smile. 

“You don’t gotta lie, I’ll turn it down a bit lol” 
I laughed and she just smirked. “Well thank you for being considerate” as I leaned in and kissed her on the forehead. “Not many people are these days.” I recall myself thinking “wow, she’s considerate, really likes me and enjoys my company? Well damn..”  I didn’t say anything further, I felt content. 

We started getting cleaned up, “well I don’t have any manly soap or shampoos..” I didn’t say anything and took her body wash,  lathered up and started washing myself “I don’t mind, I can smell pretty too” she laughed, covering her mouth with her hand. 

It was then I reached over and started lathering up her back and shoulders, she started getting closer to me, our bodies full on skin to skin contact, it was an immediate rush of blood to places. There’s something about skin to skin contact that just does something to me, I could never explain it, but damn it felt good, even more so since it was coming from her. 

I took my time getting her clean, she had no problems reaching behind and helping me get clean too. “You make it really hard for a girl to concentrate you know that right?” I could feel her stroking me again, not nonchalantly any more, it was with a bit of force, and vigorously. “Well you’re the one with you hands all over my cock, you’re just as bad 😜” 

She turned around to me, “guilty as charged, will you wash my front too?” She was gorgeous, water running down her chest, partially soapy hair slicked back from the water. I kissed her as she leaned somewhat forward. Her hands still working my shaft, I started going to work on her chest, squeezing and pulling on her nipples, it wasn’t long after that she moved to the side and helped me rinse the soap off me. She kneeled down and started to slowly take me in her mouth, her other hand rubbing her clit and fingering herself. The water falling on us be dammed she wanted it right then. 

Finally she took all of me, somewhat gagging and my cock went further down her throat. Pretty sure she started to cum not long after, I could feel her twinge and pull her head back, letting out a moan, while still trying to fit all of me in her mouth. She stood up right after, and gave me a stare, turned herself around spreading her legs, hands on her ass spreading that too. “Well aren’t you gonna fuck me now?” I moved closer to her, grabbing her hip with one hand and reaching up grabbing on her chest. Just then I started to slip in, I could tell instantly she was sore down there. 

“I wanna go all the way, but I know
You’re sore..” 

“Ohh I don’t mind, every time you enter, I don’t think about it, pleasure takes over and it doesn’t matter.. lol” 

I started going deeper inside her, this time it was different, it was like I reached an area I hadn’t felt before, “fuck what the hell did you hit? And please don’t stop!” She said. 
 
Well both felt it, somehow I was deeper inside than I had ever been, I’m not sure if it was a position thing, or the fact we were going slower, but every time I hit that deep it was a wave of pleasure for both of us. 

“I’m not sure what it is, but every time I hit it, I nearly want to finish.” 

“Well you better finish quicker than, cause Jesus that feels good.. and make sure you don’t pull out..😈😈” 

“You sure about that?” I’m mean it feels good but that’s risky.” 

“It’ll be fine, just trust me.” 

With that I made sure to push further, each time felt like a little deeper, till one time she let me know I was going too deep. I made sure back off a bit. 

“Babe you feel good but careful” I nuzzled up to her ear and apologized. “Sorry” she turned her head, looked at me and said it’s okay, just finish quick. Kissing me back. I could feel her start to clench me with her vagina, letting me know she was close again too. She was pushing herself back on me using the wall, it wasn’t long after she came all over me.. one or two more pumps and I started to pulse again, one pulse and it went right inside, I pushed in again and shot another pulse, I could hear her moan along as I filled her up. 

“Omg you came so much..where did that come from?” I had pulled out and she turned
to me beat red, blushing. It was rather cute thinking back. 

“I lm not sure, but it felt good.” 

With that the water started getting colder, it was time to get out, I got out first and grabbed her towel for her, and grabbed mine, drying ourselves off, “so park, river, lunch or maybe the beach?” She asked. 

“I’m up for whatever!” I said with a grin. “How does dinner sound too? or is that too much?” 

“Sounds like a date.” 

She smacked my ass again, and kissed me. 

“I’m gonna go get a change of clothes. See you in about 30?” 

“Just get out of here, the longer you take the longer I’m gonna have to wait.” 

With that I was out the door..

1ivtr3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/jawsurgery/comments/1ivtr3r/my_jaw_surgery_story_at_35_mo_will_update/,My jaw surgery story at 3.5 mo (will update),"Below, I go through the day of my procedure and the following days, noting information I think pre-op peeps will find useful. At the bottom, I've enclosed a list of supplies I wouldn't have survived without, as well as key takeaways.

For those of you who care about the super-specifics, below are my diagnoses and procedures:

DJS (procedures listed below)  
1. Application of arch bars  
2. LeFort 1 (single piece) with bone graft  
3. Bilateral sagittal split osteotomy of the mandible  
4. Genioplasty

Diagnoses (primary failure of eruption)  
1. Open posterior occlusal relationship \[M26.221\]  
2. Microgenia \[M26.06\]  
3. Mandibular hypoplasia \[M26.04\]

**Day 0**  
So, the last thing I remember going into my surgery was talking to the doctors in the operating room. I was resolved to do it, but I probably wouldn’t have been acting nearly as calm as I was if they hadn’t given me the calming drug via my IV.

My surgery started around 11 AM and ended at about 8 PM, from what I can tell. I remember waking up to the worst feeling ever—the intubation tube (which had been run thru one of my nostrils) being yanked out. I instantly began thrashing around (or at least trying to), choking, coughing, and saying (or trying to say) over and over again, “I can't breathe, I can't breathe.” I heard voices around me, saying, “This was a \[words describing my surgery\], and it went really well, she looks great.”

The next 48 hours or so were absolute hell. From the operating room, I was taken to some area and put under the care of an extremely inept nurse. I’ve worked in hospitality myself, so I’m a pretty understanding recipient of service, but she didn’t do anything I asked, and she was trying to give me absolutely ridiculous insulin doses (I'm type 1 diabetic), while ignoring my panicked attempts to communicate that she absolutely should not do what she was suggesting. She was openly irritated and impatient with me.

Thank God I was taken to my room before long. Once transferred to my bed, I promptly threw up. I threw up 2 more times that night, then fell asleep on my left side (which, unknown to me, had fractured during the surgery) after at least an hour of dry heaving. My night nurse should have rolled me onto my back but didn't. Otherwise, that nurse was awesome and attentive, especially in comparison to the first one who I had right out of surgery. I was able to talk in a way that could be understood once I got to the room and wasn't interrupted by vomiting.

I got 2-3 short bursts of sleep this night.

**Day 1**  
The next day sucked without my night nurse. The nurse I had for the day was like the first nurse I’d had, minus the attitude. She said, “Okay,” to everything I asked, but took forever to do things. I had to ask over and over again for water, to be unhooked from the IV to use the restroom, to receive pain meds, to bring Vaseline for my horribly peeling, split, swollen lips. The pain meds were super key, but not because of any sharp pain, just a general achiness and sense of damage, if that makes sense.

NOTE: Do NOT let your jaw bra out of your sight! The night nurse had removed my jaw bra, which was covered in blood and vomit, and my mom had left it in the sink. At some point, a cleaning lady had come in and took it away with the other used rags in the room. So, I spent the next morning asking for one over and over again. I desperately needed it, to limit the swelling and help me relax my jaw a bit. I felt I couldn't get ""comfortable"" without it, because I was tense in the jaw area.

My extremely sore throat made it nearly impossible to get anything down, but I had to drink a certain amount of water to get out in time. It seemed insurmountable. I'm not even sure whether I actually succeeded, but I was discharged anyway. It took like 8 hours from the time I was approved to leave to actually get out because of how awful the service was.

I got 2-3 bursts of sleep, about 2-4 hours each this night.

**Day 2**  
I woke up crying from pain.

Absolutely shitty, but less than Friday because I had control of my painkillers. It was impossible to get any pills down. I'm not sure why they didn't just give me liquid meds, but I couldn't reliably take any meds (antibiotics, painkillers) till the end of the day on this day because up to this point, I'd had to grind them into a DISGUSTING tasting paste and try to choke it down despite having only a teeny tiny canal in my swollen mouth through which  to stick the little catheter on the end of my feeding syringe. I was supposed to receive 2 of those but only got one. Received no instructions on cleaning, but I tried to run nearly boiling water through it (only possible because we had a hot water dispenser) after every use.

I was constantly drooling and exhausted all day. I couldn't breathe through my nose at all up to this point, and that didn't change until later on. Afrin was all I was given for this (couldn't get steroids because of type 1 diabetes), and it didn't really work because the dried blood that had filled both nostrils didn't allow the spray to penetrate.

I got 3 hours of sleep this night.

**Day 3**  
I woke up crying from pain.

It was my first day taking esomeprazole (prescribed to counter negative stomach effects of the cocktail of other drugs I was prescribed). It was slightly less awful than Day 2. 

This was the day I finally got liquid antibiotics (had to text my oral surgeon to ask him to give me all new prescriptions that were liquid). Everything (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and antibiotics) got switched over to liquid except the oxy and esomeprazole, which were super tiny pills anyway.

My extreme sore throat continued, and it was still difficult to get liquids down, but better than the sand-like pill paste I'd been struggling with up to this point.

At this point, I was suffering from an extreme lack of sleep. I had read everyone else's posts on Reddit., so I was prepared for this and not panicking. Despite knowing I needed sleep for recovery, I trusted that as things continued to recover and my sleep debt built, I'd manage to sleep more. 

This was the day I finally got oxy. I think it allowed me to sleep more than I had managed to so far, and I would go on to feel much better on Day 4 because of this.

**Day 4**  
I woke up feeling awful, crying from pain like the other days. Today, however, I finally had a solid idea of everything I needed to do to care for myself. I also knew the ways to alleviate how shitty I was feeling. Some of it I learned from Reddit (hot showers), and some I realized on my own (getting up, walking around, and doing things to help get the blood flowing and get my mind on other things).

This was the day everything turned around. I managed to get down more than a sip of coffee (was cleared for coffee from Day 1), which helped with the withdrawal I'd been suffering from. 

This was also the first day I felt able to get attempt getting REMOTELY close to a day's worth of calories in via the syringe. My doctors had said I needed to be eating a caloric SURPLUS this entire time. There is simply no way I could've pulled this off, no matter how hard I tried. This ""failure"" made me feel super depressed and a bit anxious about my recovery.

This day, I regained my ability to breathe through my nose and fully close my mouth (had to decide to do it and effortfully close it, I wasn't just able to do it naturally or without effort). Closing my mouth and keeping it closed (which required conscious effort) helped immensely with the drooling. Being able to breathe through my nose helped with the sore throat a lot. 

This was the day I was cleared to remove my jaw bra, but I definitely didn't want to, and kept wearing it.

I finally got my pain med regime in check. I learned to anticipate the wearoff to an extent so I wouldn't have to suffer waiting for pain meds to kick in once old ones wore off.

I finally started feeling decent about the odds of sleeping upon going to bed.

I finally had sex for the first time since the surgery. (I get that not everyone would be thinking about that, but some of us have more needs than others.)

This unfortunately was also the day I started noticing increasing cheek/tongue pain caused by the arch bars. It was likely more noticeable because I was more able to move my mouth and body because I felt better.

It was nice sleeping with my mouth closed for once!

**Day 5**  
I woke up with moderate nausea. This was unexpected because I had thought my stomach was doing super well, especially since I hadn't started the esomeprazole until Day 3 and been fine all that time. It may have been because learning to breathe with my mouth fully closed on Day 4 led to me swallowing much more blood/drool/mucus over the previous day and night. 

This nausea made me feel like things might be getting worse overall. 

My routine at this point was getting up, walking around, drinking some water, taking liquid acetaminophen and an ibuprofen tablet upon first waking up. Gatorade also helped a lot with calories and something pleasant to consume.

This was the first day I didn't have to keep a towel tucked into my jaw bra to catch spit, because I felt I could control when it came out.

My noticeably sore throat would wax and wane. Below is a list of causes I perceived of this problem.

\- intubation trauma  
\- swallowing a ton of irritating meds (syrups, pills, etc.), some of which required multiple attempts to get down  
\- throat clearing (to avoid swallowing mucus)  
\- mouth breathing (dries it out)  
\- nose breathing (which accelerates the constant postnasal drip of bloody mucus draining from your sinuses)

By the end of this day, I had managed to smile multiple times and actually see more of my bands.

Throughout the whole process up to this point, I was experiencing extreme forgetfulness. Could have been caused by a wide variety of things, but it cleared up once I was more recovered.

**Day 6**  
At 1 am this morning, I broke my front band. I texted my oral surgeon (because I didn't have any more) and tried to keep sleeping in a way that wouldn't put extra strain on my jaw positioning. He ended up saying it was normal for them to break by this point.

My postop appointment was at 2pm on this day. I was told that I had to stick to the liquid (but not just clear liquids thankfully) diet for 2-3 MORE weeks before I could advance to soft, no-chew. Apparently, one of my jaw bones had fractured unexpectedly during the surgery (my jaw bones are underdeveloped because my lack of erupted teeth means they didn't get grown through the pressures of chewing like everyone else's). He took off the tape that had been holding my new chin together. My skin had a horrible reaction to the tape, and I had a red rash that didn't go away for another 1.5 weeks or so. He told me I didn't need bands because everything was healing very straight, but I opted for 2 in the front since I didn't know how to comfortably position my jaw.

I was still pretty swollen, probably not helped by my salt/sugar consumption. But it was hard to find motivation to consume much else.

**Day 7**  
Today, I felt a decent amount of improvement. Mornings have been the worst in terms of swelling, due to lying down overnight. I got a good amount of stuff done and felt decent today. Still would not have been able to resume regular work. My pain was still troublesome. Started getting somewhat emotional because of PMS and emotional/physical drain of the recovery.

**Day 8**  
I was extremely emotional this day (thanks PMS). I went to coffee with a friend for a few hours (had to drink through the syringe+catheter, :<). Had a THC tincture. It totally killed the pain. I slept for about 13 hours this night. 

**Day 10**  
My boyfriend's mom (a nurse) said my swelling was way down and that I looked almost back to normal. My pain was pretty minimal. I still took painkillers, but decided I might try going without the following day.

**Day 12**  
Swelling still bad in mornings. Was having a pretty bad time with my blood sugar. Still needed acetaminophen.

**Day 14**  
For the first time, I woke up without feeling like I needed to immediately take/do something for my pain (like walking around). Went without any painkillers all day for the first time.

**Day 18 or 19**  
Resumed taking ibuprofen, more for inflammation than pain. My first day back at work. This was the first day I really enjoyed applying heat instead of only cold. This was the first day I started feeling mostly normal and being somewhat okay with my appearance.

**Day 26**  
Things were only moderately shitty for this week. Pain every day, but more of an annoyance than anything. Still couldn't make it through the day without ibuprofen, but at this point I was taking only 1 or 2 a day (one in the morning and sometimes one at night).

**Day 28**  
I got an infection in my left sinus/nose region. It started out as a chemically smell for a day or two, but then the smell became increasingly rancid, and yellowish clear fluid started dripping from my left nostril. My surgeon prescribed antibiotics once I texted him about it, and it seemed to go away right away.

I had a second postop this week and was cleared for no-chew.

**1 Month**  
Throughout this whole time, I have been very fatigued, tearful, depressed. The recovery took a lot out of me. 

**1 Month + 1 Week**  
I had another postop, and based on the swelling on my left side, my surgeon took a scan. My left sinus was full of fluid. I was not cleared to advance beyond no-chew. 

At this point, any pain I had was inconsequential. It would be worst in morning and pop up randomly throughout the day, but I would just notice it and move on with my day. This was when I stopped using the jaw brace with the hot/cold gel packs.

**2 Months**  
I suddenly gained back sensation in areas I hadn't even realized I was numb (parts of my chin and the roof of my mouth). 

**2.5 Months**  
I had another postop and another scan, as my left side was still more swollen than the right. I was prescribed more antibiotics and Mucinex for the possible infection. Otherwise, everything was healing straight, as it had been from the start.

My oral surgeon said he is considering removing my hardware with another operation and if that doesn't work, referring me to an ENT who can widen my drainage hole under my left sinus to allow my left sinus to drain. Because I don't want him to stop treating me for noncompliance, I haven't told him that I cannot have any more operations. I can't afford to miss work, and because it's a new year, my OOP max on my marketplace health insurance has started over for the year, and now it's like 60% higher than it was last year. I don't have $8k to pay for out-of-pocket costs. I'm just hoping this problem goes away on its own. 

**3.5 Months (current, will update)**  
I tested positive for COVID yesterday (which was also my birthday). I'm still relatively more swollen on my left side (the side with the fracture). I don't really have pain (aside from sinus pain that started this week since I caught COVID). 

My next postop will be at the 4-month mark after my surgery. Before that, I plan to take a weeklong course of fluconazole I got from my PCP, because she and I both think the problem may be systemic Candida overgrowth (can affect various parts of the body), as I'm type 1 diabetic and have suffered from recurrent yeast infections at various points throughout my life. I'm hoping that by the time I have my 4-month appointment, the fluconazole has helped combat whatever's going on in my left sinus. Maybe my oral surgeon will clear me for light chewing. Don't come at me, but I've been eating things that require very slight teeth action here and there. I mainly ""chew"" with my tongue. But I'm talking super soft stuff like pasta and ground beef. Nothing crazy.

I'm doing the NeilMed sinus rinse occasionally. I don't notice any good or bad effect from it. Maybe feeling a bit cleaner in my sinuses right after. For a while, I have sort of been able to smell my mucus, but it didn't smell infected/gross like before, and it may just be because of my airways having a new shape, and the chemicals in the meds I've been taking for congestion or those in the protein shakes that make up a lot of my diet. For a while, sensation has gradually coming back in various areas. 

My fatigue has decreased a lot, but my energy levels still aren't what they were before the surgery. I expect to feel 100% by 1 year postop, ideally sooner. 

**Key Takeaways**  
\- SLEEP UPRIGHT!!! I used a wedge sex pillow, and slept on it and some others with the long side up (meaning I was closer to sitting than lying down, but that's essential for being able to breathe and keeping swelling down).  
\- DO NOT swallow your spit. If you don't want to drool constantly, hold it in your mouth and then let it fall out periodically.  
\- Take pain meds on a regime that works for you, but before you're in pain.  
\- Do not slack on your antibiotics, especially in the first 48 hours after the surgery, but equally as long as you're prescribed them. You don't want to deal with any infection.  
\- You can probably take only 2 weeks off of work if you're in similar health to me, but I would've fared much better if I took off for 3 weeks instead.  
\- APPLY COLD COMPRESSES (and hot, later on, once it feels good)  
\- everything costs a ton of money. I bought so much more during recovery--liquid shakes, etc.  
\- food situation sucks but you eventually get used to it to where it's only mildly depressing  
\- don't slack on your hygiene!!

**Supplies I NEEDED**  
\- standing mirror (you get ""food"" everywhere)  
\- elastic jaw bra (get extras if you can!)  
\- jaw brace with removable hot/cold gel packs (I suggest getting 2 of these \[https://a.co/d/czsB8FM\], $14 each)  
\- Mucinex   
\- dental wax (buy a TON. you need to change it like 2x a day.). it makes a HUGE difference with the cuts inside the mouth from the arch bars  
\- FORCEPS (it would've been pretty impossible to remove my dental wax without them)

**Supplies that helped**

I help him with his children in his home, just a few hrs a week. His children also attend a school where MY parents are their teachers. Sometimes I also help the children at their mom’s house (my boss’s ex). Strange situation right?

He is a very thoughtful, emotionally aware, sweet, caring man who has dealt with a similarly painful situation to mine- dealing with an abusive ex and long drawn out court battles. We have bonded a lot over sharing our emotions surrounding these experiences… he has been separated from his ex for 3 years (and has dated since). I have been separated from mine for 1.5 years. 

Here’s the thing. He also makes intense eye contact with me. Once I mentioned that I really like tea, and since then he has left out the tea kettle and boxes of tea for me (he’s even prepared it for me from start to finish before 👀), he has bought me food to have at his house, on Thanksgiving he brought my family and I a big delicious ham (probably to show thanks but still), and he has also given my family sausage from a wild boar that he personally hunted (holy shit can’t believe that happened haha). He supports me during rough patches with me having to share custody with my ex. He also hugs me every single time he sees me, at least once and sometimes more. I know this may be subjective but I genuinely feel that there is warmth and sweetness in these hugs from him- he is not disrespectful or feeling me up or anything lol, I think these hugs just stem from genuine affection. He also doesn’t hug my parents this frequently despite them being his children’s teachers, or other people I’ve seen him being friendly with/interacting with. There have been many mornings where we talk for 30 mins (even one morning we talked for AN HOUR about all sorts of subjects) when he obviously could just leave to get ready for work. He is a business owner so he won’t get in trouble for being late to work, but still! 

He’s also taken his shirt off in front of me before and come out shirtless LOL. Hasn’t done it in a while but yeah… he’s clearly comfortable around me. 

Obviously all of this combined has me feeling some type of way. I am really into him, and about a month ago I asked if he would ever want to hang out and get coffee or go on a walk, since my therapist suggested I get out more (this was after we talked about how we both are in therapy) and also bc I just genuinely enjoyed our conversation last time I had helped him. He said he also really enjoys our conversations and thinks it’s a good idea to get out in general, but that most of his free time is spent at the gym. He asked if we could “rain check” locking down plans. I just told him no problem, and that I understood bc I really am in the same boat. 

Anyway, he hasn’t mentioned making plans again since then! I guess I just want to get other perspectives (especially from men)… what is going on here? Does he like me? Is he just being friendly or nice to me? Do you think he will ever make plans with me and was his rain check a soft no? I’d love to hear your thoughts on this situation.

I agreed but said that if we were going to go to the pharmacy and grocery shop, I wanted to be there at 9:30 when they open so that we don’t have to stand in line and wait for upwards of 45 minutes like we have in the past. She made a comment that it sometimes is just as busy right when they open also to which I disagreed, and we left it at that. This morning we woke up did our normal morning routine coffee hang out. Shower and she did her makeup and hair while I cleaned up the house started laundry, folded laundry that was dry, took out garbage’s, etc. By the time she was done with her hair and makeup, it was 930 she asked if we were going to the gym. I told her that we would go get her prescriptions and do the grocery shopping then we could work out after. Very upset. And asked me why I didn’t care about what she wanted to do. I told her that we can do anything she wants to do as long as we get the groceries done first because I’m not going to wait in a line and that I had said that the night before, I explained that we could have worked out beforehand, but she did not get ready in time. She got extremely upset and said that it was obviously a miscommunication. She feels like I don’t care about her and her wants and needs. I explained to her that I do care about her wants and needs, but it makes me feel disrespected when we make plans the night before and then she just ignores them. This turned into a fight and now she wants me to get counseling because she says that I need help from someone to be a better husband. Was this a miscommunication or a lack of respecting what I said needed to happen so I can do all the things she wants with her.

I wanted to see you so badly yesterday and see if I could see it in your eyes? Do you adore me too? I adore, admire and respect you. I wanted so badly for you to text me last night. I didn't have my kids, so I could have went to you. To know with certainty that was what my heart wants, is it reciprocated by your heart? I'm sure you were exhausted and I wanted you to hold me as I melted into your arms. I wanted to hear about your day and look into your eyes. 

I find your touch healing. When our fingers touch at work or when we embraced. I desire that touch to be so much more. I never want to hurt you, abuse you or use you. I wear my heart on my sleeve and I'm insanely honest. You do need to know more about me and my life and vice versa. If you're depressed I'll hold you. You're so amazing and I would tell you why I have fallen so hard. I'm saving that to be special words spoken. I have so many beautiful things to tell you about you that you don't see. 

I wanted you to kiss me. I wanted clarity. I want you to feel cared for. I thought that was a possibility yesterday. My mind played tricks on me. I want us to break each other free from both of our respective prisons. I'm in my Rupunzel Era. I've been saying that for months. 

I want to see you outside of work. I want to coordinate our coffee breaks together and go some place quiet for a few stolen minutes. I want to text you cheeky things. I want to write you cute notes with purple ink and put them in the lunch I pack for you. Could we have this one day? I wanted to bring you that limited edition pin I bought you months ago and kept in my drawer hidden. Keeping it for you if our feelings were ever spoken to one another. It was the perfect sweetest inside joke gift. I thought it would make you smile and feel seen, if we ever got there. 

Alas, there were no return texts and I didn't see you in passing all day. My brain led me on. It wanted me to think it was a possibility. It was a mental oasis. If you feel like you can't take it on right now. That's ok. I just want to talk about it. We can just be friends who are getting closer. Or you can tell me it's in my head.

I certainly slip up sometimes, but I always do my best to hold myself accountable and be a better partner for her. In the last few months, she's become increasingly demanding and it's putting strain on our relationship and has heightened my anxiety. There were little things like getting upset when I ran into a friend from high school and talked to her for a while, or starting a fight because I canceled plans with her to console a friend who got broken up with.

More recently, she demanded I show her my instagram messages and had me show her any conversation I had with a woman. Some of them got a pass because they were relatives or girlfriends of guy friends. There was one conversation with a woman who was friends with both of us, which was completely cordial and appropriate, but I was forced to block her because she couldn't trust me talking to her. More recently, I had told her I was getting coffee with a colleague who was seeking career advice, and I always want to let her know when I am with a female colleague to make her comfortable. She told me not to go and asked for it to be a phone call instead. Later that week I had a meeting with a few collaborators who were set to do a project with me later in the year. She demanded that I not go because there would be women there, and said I may have to cancel the project entirely for her comfort. I have been working on these projects for several months and I am scared of losing career opportunities while also ceding control in my relationship. When I took these concerns to my friends, they confessed that she had looked through my phone before and had gone through my room and possessions.

I have never been unfaithful to any partner, and I have done my best to reassure my girlfriend I would never go behind her back or do anything inappropriate with another woman. I love her, but this is all making me anxious and I'm worried it's a dealbreaker.

1ivtgem,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ivtgem/sudden_appearance_of_seizures_caused_by/,Sudden appearance of seizures caused by paroxysmal laryngospasm,"
I’m a 21 y/o male, who has, as of December 22nd, 2023, seizures when sleeping. Unknown cause as of now.

Personal history preceding seizures:
Before it all occurred, I was training for bodybuilding and was eating anything and everything to put on as much weight. That means lots of fast-food, multiple meals a day, créatine, protein powder, BCAA then changed to EAA. I was also working in a manufacturing business where they make water pumps for forest fires, and the building didn’t have the best ventilation. Also wasn’t doing much cardio in my workouts. I went up from 185lbs to 235lbs in the span of about 3 years. Also consumed lots of eggs. Ate my food fast, sometimes it would cause me to gasp, which is my bodies way of burping. I rarely drink coffee, I don’t drink beer.

Medical history preceding seizures:
3/4 Peanut allergy. 1/4 egg allergy, very mild. I’ve had Bell’s palsy when I was about 10 y/o. Also had occasional nosebleeds that happened at random times throughout the year. A third of the way through 2023, I had dryness in my mouth when waking up and needed to have water next to the bed. September 22nd, went to a wedding and the next morning I had the dryness but couldn’t swallow and ended up spitting out the water. End of September-beginning of October, I had symptoms of Mononucleosis and was placed on prednisone and was able to go back to daily activities after a week. After that, some mornings I had dryness, some mornings I didn’t.

Events after seizures:
 Come the day of December 22nd, the night before I stayed up late working on school project. Was soldering pieces together. Went to bed late, had coffee late to stay up and finish everything. After school on the 22nd, I came back home, exhausted, and took a nap. When I woke up I wasn’t able to move and had a constant swallowing reflex. My body started to shake, my jaw was pulled to the side, my arm stiffened up, eyes rolled back and I had no control over my body anymore. Ended up passing out after a few seconds. Step-father came down and I told him I think I had a seizure and he called the ambulance and spent the night in the hospital. Each time I slept I would wake up not breathing and then after a few seconds would go back to being able to breathe. This happened every night ever since. Some nights I had a seizure, some nights I just had spasms where I couldn’t breathe. I’m fully conscious throughout the whole beginning of it all and am able to see my surroundings until I pass out.

I have gone to see ENT specialists, neurologists, sleep specialists, infectious disease doctors, and a naturopath. None have a clue as to what triggers it. I’ve also done a barium swallow to see if I have acid reflux, I had mild reflux but was treated when I took pantoprazole. I am currently on 1g of Keppra (Levetiracetam) and 1000mg of Aptiom (Eslicarbazepine) once a day, which has reduced the number of spasms from 8-11 to 1-2 a night, and has also kept seizures from happening. I’ve done MRIs, EEGs, EKGs. No irregularities. I’m fully vaccinated. I’m on a strict diet followed by the naturopath, no longer on any supplements and no longer eating eggs. I am still being followed by the neurologist and the ENT specialist. They’ve all crossed off acid reflux and sleep apnea. The main lead is that it’s caused by paroxysmal laryngospasms, but no clue as to what triggers it.
I started playing rugby in the summer of 2024, and I sometimes have spasms while physically exerting myself. Other than that I only have them at night right before falling asleep.

I’ll answer any questions to the best of my knowledge. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

""You're 30?!"" I said, surprised. ""You look younger than your age. Are you single?""

I may have been busy with the coffee orders, but I was eagerly waiting for her response, hoping she would say, *""Yes.""*

And then, the moment I was waiting for came—though not quite in the way I expected. With a shrug, she answered, ""Yes, of course! Why would I need a man to make me happy?""

*""Well, you haven’t met me,”* I wanted to say, but I held back. She might take it the wrong way, thinking I was just another flirt, someone she had heard similar lines from before.

I may be younger than her—four years to be exact—but I really like her. Her cute height, curly hair, round eyes—ugh! She’s so cute. I wish I could hug her! The way she tucked her hair behind her ear before neatly tying it into a ponytail caught my attention. My gaze followed her hands as she traced her curls before putting on her glasses*. Oh, we’re both wearing glasses. We’re not even in a relationship, yet we already have something in common.* I blushed at the thought, unaware that I was smiling like a foolish puppy waiting for its owner’s affection.

""You okay?"" she asked, snapping me out of my thoughts. ""You should have your machine checked and replace those rubber gaskets. See that water leaking? That’s because you’re not taking proper care of this espresso machine,"" she nagged while continuing to inspect it.

How lucky I was to have brought my oldest machine to this event. Who would have thought I’d meet someone as passionate about this industry as I am? I love coffee, yes, but not as obsessively as my father—who grows, processes, and does everything just to ensure my mom always gets the best coffee. And somehow, I liked the idea of doing the same—waking up in the morning to make coffee for this girl I just met yesterday.

I joined this week-long event to support a friend and, of course, my dad. I wanted to see the proud look on his face as his coffee received an award as one of the best in the province. It’s just a week-long event, but I have a feeling it will be worthwhile.

""Excuse me, Ms. Maya, here’s your Spanish latte,"" I called out to one of my regular customers, only to realize that I had been caught staring at her intently.

""You two look cute together. Girlfriend?"" Ms. Maya asked with a smirk.

""She’s from the other booth. They sell coffee machines and supplies. You might want to check them out,"" I said, redirecting the conversation.

""Hey! You have a customer. You might want to get back to your booth,"" I told her. I needed space. I couldn’t concentrate when she was around.

""Nah, I’m good. My trainee is handling her first event, and I’m observing whether she can manage sales without me,"" she replied, her eyes still fixed on my old machine.

As she pulled out the portafilter, I instinctively reached for it, my hand brushing against hers. *Oh gosh!* I hadn’t expected to hold her hand. Now what? I decided to play it cool. Guiding her gently aside, I asked, ""What needs to be replaced?"" I leaned in with her, pretending to inspect the issue. I already knew what needed fixing, but the sight of her beside me, passionately talking about it, was endearing. I turned my head, and there she was—her face just an inch away from mine.

The air was supposed to smell like coffee, but all I could breathe in was her vanilla perfume. Sweet. I stared at her, noticing how her oversized glasses accentuated her features. Did I mention how cute she is? Her eyes, magnified by the lenses, looked even bigger. I bet she’s even prettier without them.

For a moment, time seemed to stop.

""Ate! Someone wants to talk to you about a discount. I don’t know what to do!"" her trainee called out, interrupting the moment.

Snapping back to reality, I quickly withdrew my hand from hers and let go of the portafilter. She placed it back onto my machine before being pulled away by her trainee. I kept staring at her as she left. *""Ate?"" Maybe she’s a sales representative. Could I hire her at my café? What am I thinking? Am I really that desperate?*

""We saw that! You two look good together,"" Brix, one of my business partners, teased.

""I know, but I don’t think she’s into me,"" I said, focusing on cleaning up my bar. It needed to be spotless—just in case she came back to lecture me again about my machine.

""Ask her out. What’s the worst that could happen?"" Brix suggested.

""Rejection. I could be rejected,"" I replied.

""You? Rejected? You come from a well-known family in this province, you own a coffee shop, a roastery, a coffee farm, you have a car… what else?"" Brix started listing my so-called advantages before I cut him off.

""Maybe I have those things, but she doesn’t need them. I mean, look at her,"" I gestured toward her.

We both turned to where she stood. She looked like a doll, her eyes shimmering as she spoke with a customer. She had looked at me the same way just moments ago. That same enthusiasm, but only as a customer.

Seeing the look on my face, Brix patted my back. ""There’s nothing wrong with trying. Go for it!"" Then, the idiot punched my arm lightly.

*I know there’s no harm in trying, but what if she only sees me as a potential client? Should I take the risk?*

1ivtaa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1ivtaa6/riding_your_brains_natural_patterns_the_art_of/,Riding Your Brain’s Natural Patterns - The Art of Habit Stacking,"Hi everyone! I’d like to share a bit of a story around how discovering habit stacking has completely transformed how I view habits and productivity. In the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling through various subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. Some helped temporarily, many didn’t. This is when I stumbled on the concept of habit stacking - the idea of linking new habits to existing ones.

I started small: after pouring my morning coffee (existing habit), I would write the three main tasks I needed to get done for the day (new habit). After brushing my teeth, I would meditate for five minutes. It worked because I didn’t need to remember to “find time” to plan my day. The coffee routine was already wired into my brain, and planning naturally became part of it.

The beauty of habit stacking is that it works with your brain’s natural tendencies rather than against them. Our brains love patterns and routines. When we consistently do one thing after another, our brains begin to link these activities together. The main problem I had before I discovered habit stacking was decision fatigue - having to figure out “what’s next”. I’d spend more time planning than doing.

As months went on, I needed a way to keep track of the various habits routines I had throughout the day but none of the apps I found really captured the way how habits naturally flowed together. This is where I shamelessly plug my app - Chayn. I spent my weekends and hours after work since building it and now it’s [available to download on the Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chayn-stack-habits/id6741157498) if you want to give it a try. But no pressure!

If you have trouble maintaining habits, I highly recommend you give habit stacking a go and I hope it helps you as much as it has helped me. It doesn’t have to be anything crazy - start off with something small and build from there. I wish you the best of luck in your journey to be more disciplined!",2,1740258912.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

- they immediately took away our DO lounge after advertising that it would be a part of our resources. They are replacing it with a Starbucks coffee… Even though our building already has 2 cafes and a ton of vending machines 
- They do not let you review your exams so you are left wondering what you did wrong. They provide you with an exam soft report that has a very vague question topic given for each question. But it’s not helpful in actually figuring out what you did wrong. So there’s no way to improve that topic for boards.
- Lastly and mainly they do not prepare you for boards in anyway. I’ve looked at the step 1 first aid book for this year and there is a ton of stuff in our class lectures that does not apply. Nova harps on irrelevant small details that are never going to be asked of you again. And their question format is point and shoot “which TLR does this” there are zero vignette style questions that mimic board style questions 
- you would be better off going anywhere else. I’m gonna have to do two times the amount of work to get ready for boards as I would if I had gone elsewhere 
- when you are interviewing at universities, make sure you ask them how the question styles are and if they actually mimic the level of board style questions. I wish I would’ve done more research. I got captivated by the scenery of South Florida and the positive attitudes of the student students who were a part of the interview process.

When pioneer schools and other schools were held in my KH, the dinner-making were divided among the congregations to ease the financial burden for the congregation. They said that from the stage; To ease the financial burden for the congregations. Volunteers were sought to provide food/cake/coffee etc.

I was a pioneer myself and very introverted, so pioneering was a nightmare for me in every way. To make it easier for myself, I started making my own rules (good for me). When volunteers were needed again for cooking, I signed up - partly because I love to cook and partly because I decided that the hours spent prepping, planning, cooking, cleaning etc. could be put on my report. 🙈 I also chose to pay for everything myself, perhaps because I felt I was cheating a little by putting the hours in. Paying myself was also a form of sacrifice - after all, I was a pioneer and eternally broke.

I was told to make goulash and mashed potatoes for 40 people - far more than I expected. I cycled around the city to find deals, cooked the food in my tiny kitchen and transported it back and forth on my bike - a far greater financial and time burden than I had anticipated. Good for the report though. 

My question is: If I had gone to the elder who gathered volunteers and given him the receipt, would I have been compensated? No one ever offered it, but since they said from the stage that the congregations shared the costs to ease the financial burden for the, would that have been an option?

Not that I expected it, but it just crossed my mind. I always found it typical that it was the struggling pioneers who took on these tasks, while the more resourceful in the congregation didn’t. It just makes me even more frustrated at how they exploit people who genuinely want to do the right thing. And happy that im not a part of it anymore. 🫶🏼",7,1740257889.0,exjw,8,0.89,False

Once every other week when my wife wants to go out for breakfast or lunch on the weekend, I don’t follow the above routine. My 20 hours are usually from 7:30 pm to 3:30 pm the next day.

For instance, with the steel reusable pods that have no barcode/bitcode, what are the brewing parameters. I see reusable pods for small (espresso sizes) and large (regular 8 ounce). Obviously, this can't work properly without intervention. Maybe there are instructions with the pods. 

I see that CAPMESSO makes large and small sizes. And they have no barcodes. But they do say they don't work with Next. Is that because Next absolutely needs a barcode. Because of connectivity? But they don't disclaim Pop. 

So, do they depend on the users resetting the volume for the NO CODE default condition, according to the pod size being used? I could see that working, sort of. But that's only cup size, and Nespresso varies other parameters to suit the intended drink from particular coffees. 

I also see some plastic pods sold as 150ml and 230ml options with barcodes, which surely must be for volumes, but no information about other parameters. Does not say not for Next. Another offering, similar and with barcodes, also says not for Next. Yet all standard factory pods work in both. ",0,1740257708.0,nespresso,1,0.5,False

Just returned from a 7 day cruise, and I'm here to share the good and the ""meh"" of my experience. If you're planning a cruise soon, especially with Norwegian on Bliss hopefully, this detailed account will help you  make the most of your trip.
Embarkation:
 * Arrival & Check-In: We arrived around 9 a.m., and while check-in was quick, we couldn't board until noon. Lesson learned: aim for a noon check-in to avoid waiting in the terminal.We could not get into our room until after 330pm. So pack a swimsuit and sunscreen in your carry on bag.
 * Onboard: Once onboard, we checked into our muster station and that was that we could go enjoy the ship. When we got to our room we just watched the required video. overall a very simple process
 * Room: Our balcony room was spacious, but the mattress was uncomfortably firm, even with a topper. The pillows were also worn.. The room had a blow dryer and plenty of charging stations. I recommend bringing an old gift card to put in the slot to keep the air conditioner on while you're not in the room. also I recommend bringing a first aid kit and any over the counter meds you think you may not need because to buy them on the ship is a bit pricey. 
 * We purchased water for our room before we arrived its advertised in the picture as bottled water however just be aware it is canned water.  
 * Buffet & Non Specialty Dining:
   * The buffet offered a huge variety of options that changed daily. The quality of food was good and something could be found for everyone for breakfast lunch and dinner. Here you could find free lemonade, water, tea, coffee, and milk as well. They had a large selection of dessert that changed daily along with  hard ice cream that changed daily. They had several sugar free options. The hard ice cream was better than the soft serve in my personal opinion. The coconut flavor, was a hit for me.
  * Wait times at complimentary restaurants were generally short. Some dining room options were underwhelming. They had daily selections in the main dining rooms that changed and then a menu that stayed the same the entire cruise, along with options to try speciality items for $50. The Manhattan dining room was our personal favorite we got seated next to the window so we could see outside we ordered a bottle of resling for $34 the vibe was nice we enjoyed it.
   * The Local: The Local was decent for food 24 hours a day. The menu stayed the same the entire week. The burger, Reuben, and fish and chips were all good. The chicken wings (small but tasty) and pretzel bites were just okay, and the spinach dip wasn't our favorite. They also have a few arcade games and a miniature bowling alley that we really enjoyed ! 
Ship Life & Activities:
 * Pool Deck: The pool deck was crowded, there is an adult pool and a childrens pool and finding a chair was a challenge. It's a huge ship however people reserved chairs early well before 8 am often leaving them unattended, despite the 30-minute hold rule. If you're not assertive and willing to move peoples towels who have been nowhere in sight for hours, you might miss out. My favorite location was the sun deck. The chairs had coushins on them and there was two hot tubs which were nice. 
Towels were only available right by the pool and also available when getting off the ship at each port so no need to pack them.
 * Crowds: The ship was packed, making it difficult to find seating at events. Lesson learned was plan plan plan and get there before the doors open or plan to stand if the event is in a smaller venue such as the cavern or the social.
 * Entertainment:
   * ""Deal or No Deal"" cost $29-$69 to play, with prizes ranging from instant win tab cards and  photos to cash, they also had a free cruise as a prize but we did not see anyone win that.
   * Bingo was $49-$79, depending on the package and cards could not be cut in half to share but the prizes ranged depending on how many winners there had been in the game and what the jackpot was. We walked away with $752. 
   * The ""Icons"" show was great! We had reservations however, even without reservations, the standby line worked for people.
   * The Jersey Boys is incredible a must see! The Beatles experience show was great if you're a beetles fan. These were our two favorite shows on board.
   * The live music in the Artium was also amazing, our favorite band was Siglo. But you could always find live music! 
   * Trivia and games shows were awesome we really enjoyed participating and people watching. Bandoke was probably our favorite to watch.
   * Comedy shows were enjoyable. Landry was our favorite.  We attended 3 events including the family friendly version the last day. Personally I didn't feel it was family friendly  especially for young children more 13+ . So if you're sensitive or don't want to have to answer questions to your young ones after maybe skip.
   * The bliss speedway was fun, but was closed a couple days due to weather and wind blowing the burning oil from the smoke stack onto the track. The cost was $15 per person with a 300lb weight limit and you must step on the scale before they let you go. The ride was 8 minutes long. You must wear tight fitting closed toe shoes so if you're looking to ride the gocarts make sure you pack accordingly. 
   * the arcade was extremely small but the games averaged about $2..
 * Specialty Dining:
 * * Cagney's: I have to be honest, Cagney's was a major disappointment. The crab cakes tasted like tuna cakes, the lobster bisque was burnt, the garlic bread was rock-hard, and the prime rib lacked flavor. I had heard great things, but it didn't live up to the hype for me.
   * Tepanyaki was the best dining experience onboard. The food was incredible, the staff was so fun loads of singing and fun. We had such an incredible time we  canceled another specialty dining reservation to go back.
**Lounges and Casino
*District Brew House was a nice location great seating area along with a good selection of beer. They also had flight samples available.
   * Sugarcane was a great location for drinks they had an indoor and outdoor area. the mojito flight was delicious ($20). The spiced mojito was my personal favorite.
   * Spice H20 was nice, it was often crowded but did have a couple hot tubs and a water fountain wading pools area.
   * The cellar wine bar was small, they did have several events for tastings and parings for $22 per person.
 * Casino: The casino was a good size with lots of gaming options and tables. The upside to the casino was they had a smoking and non smoking section.
 * Gym was very nice had a good selection of equipment free to use.
 * Spa on board. It was very nice and they did offer some $199 specials throughout the week. I inquired day one if they sold day passes to use the facilities or if they were included if you purchased a spa treatment. I was told no they only had the weekly package for $379. Unfortunate because I would have liked to try the facilities.
*Horizon Park we attempted to go there the first sea day and it was packed full of sunbathers. I had thought they had Cornhole but we were unable to find it. They had really cozy loungers. Overall a nice hangout !
* Wifi on board we had the 150 free mins from the free at sea promotion. it was plenty for us we didn't really use our phones on the ship. Most of the excursions minus harvest Caye had free WiFi at the ports. The WiFi on the ship seemed reasonable for just quick messages to family.  also the lowest the Internet package went on the ship was 9.99 per day and then went back up. 
Ports of Call:
 * Costa Maya:
   * The walk from the ship to the port area is long.
   * We opted for massages at the Mayen wellness spa ($110 for two 50-minute massages) with Wendy, which were fantastic and highly recommended. They had lots of reasonable options for myan baths and other spa services. To get here walk through all the people trying to sell you tours and through the duty free store and hang a left they usually have people outside the hut to help you.
   * We enjoyed the shops, free shows, flamingos, and beach area.
   * Drinks ranged from $6-$30. You had to make a drink purchase to use the longe chairs.
   * Cantina Latina was a okay lunch spot, with tacos and quesadillas. Nothing to write home about honestly. They were definitely over priced, and no free chips and salsa like Mexican restaurants back home. We heard the guy next to us complain it was jarred salsa and the gyy brought him out a new one that looked homemade ($20+)
 * Harvest Caye:
   * Beautiful island with plenty of free loungers by the pool and beach.
   * The animal exhibit was a nice bonus.we loved the butterfly exibit.
   * The swim-up bar offered reasonably priced drinks ($4.50-$15).
   * Food at the Harvest Bar and Grill was tasty (buffalo chicken wrap, fish tacos, adobo chicken flautas)($10+)
   * Cash or credit only on the island MasterCard and visa were definitely accepted.
   * You can rent kayaks, paddleboards, and tours on the island. rentals go to your room.
 * Roatan:
   * Pleasantly surprised by the port. We docked at the southside of the island. I had read online it was not developed and not much to do. However they did have pools, restaurants, and access to the ocean with out leaving the port.
   * We did the eco-buggy tour, which included a visit to an animal park (sloths, monkeys, toucans). Bring handstantizer
   * The buggy ride was a bit underwhelming (glorified golf cart), but fun. Be prepared for a dusty ride and wear a face mask. Bring some baby wipes or a wet wash cloth in a zip lock.
   * Las Palmas beach was nice, but rocky. Water shoes are a must. They had plenty of free loungers,  food, and drinks for purchase($10+) they also had massages on the water, and hair braiding for a fee they definitely came around several times offering their services. We only had about an hour and half at this beach.
   * Weight limits for the tour were different online than in person, online listed 275lbs  and the tickets listed 300 lbs so call Norwegian to clarify if you're concerned about weight.
 * Cozumel:
   * We visited Chankanaab, which was a bit run-down. The all-inclusive package was basic and limited to only 2 areas.
* The buffet was very limited. they did have the dolphins, and manatees that could be added to your package for $30/$60/$90. 
*the port wasn't anything but shopping you can gett cheap souvenirs. 
* if your looking for pharmacy there is a few to chose from. I have really good healthcare so nothing was cheaper than what I would get it for home so we didn't buy anything there. 
 
Also a kind reminder wash your hands, use the handstantizer and if you're sick stay in your room. The amount of people who skipped the hand washing station and who were coughing all over the place without covering their mouth was icky. We also watched 3 people vomit in the buffet area Knowing they were not feeling well. 

Overall the cruise was good. We had a wonderful time and enjoyed all the ports we visites. I think we just had really high expectations.",5,1740257331.0,NCL,2,1.0,False

2 weeks later - during christmas, i was hanging out with my friend and told her about this girl i met at the event. my friend said i had nothing to lose and convinced me to just send her a follow request and wait if she will follow me back. so i did follow her on insta, and she followed me back a few hours later. the next day i slid into her DMs and tried to make conversation by asking her about something that we had talked about during purple friday event where we had met. she responded, but her replies were very slow. sometimes it took days for her to reply. i wasn’t really focused on her during this time because i was going on dates with other people. eventually i was like fuck it, let’s just ask her if she wants to have a coffee with me sometime. she responded after a few days and said that would be nice, but she was busy for the upcoming 2 weeks due to her deadlines. so i told her that was fine and to just let me know when she was able to when she has more free time. 

10 days later (mid january) - she texted me and said she has more free time now and asked me about my availability. she also apologised for her late replies, and said insta isn’t her main communication app. i asked her if she would maybe want to exchange phone numbers if that would be easier to communicate on whatsapp. she gave me her number and we agreed to have lunch on wednesday. 

wednesday the lunch hangout - god it was so much fun. we were both so comfortable around each other and i felt so at ease. we laughed so much and made so much eye contact and smiled at each other every time when the other person finished talking. there was definitely chemistry between us. we joked around and it was overall a very nice hangout. she couldn’t hang out longer because she had work, but when we left the lunch place, instead of saying goodbye to me she asked me which way i was headed and suggested maybe i could walk with her to the next subway station, so we could talk for a little bit longer. i agreed and we talked some more. when we arrived at my subway station she gave me this big and genuine hug and i told her i had so much fun and we should do this more often. and she said yes with a huge smile and suggested maybe we could go to a cat cafe the next time (it was a direct reference to our convo we had during lunch). - i was over the moon, smiling so much on my way back home. i was so excited for our next hangout that wasn’t even planned yet lol. i think from this point i was slowly developing a crush on her.

some days later, we were texting and i told her i was at university campus working on my thesis. she finished her internship and texted me if i was still at school. she spontaneously came by to visit me at school after her internship. i was so happy to see her, and i felt more nervous around her than normal. 

during the same week, i sent her a voice message asking her if she was down to join me and my friends to the museum. she said yes and joined us. so there is some extra context about this museum day. two friends were with me, one of them i call (S) is a very good friend of mine and i know her for 2 years. another ‘friend’ i call her (P) invited herself to join our museum day. i dont know her well and couldn’t call her a friend yet, more like an acquaintance. i asked both S and P to observe me and my crush hanging out, to see if my crush was maybe into me or not. but P ended up flirting with my crush and tried to get her attention the entire time, making me fell into the background. i was so mad and upset and felt so betrayed i didn’t know how to react. i was just mostly sad because i didn’t get the time to hang out with my crush as i wanted. P really crossed my boundaries and she kinda broke the unspoken girl code of not hitting on your friend’s crush knowing your friend has a a crush on someone. 

start of february - fast forward a few days later, i told P about my boundaries that she had crossed and decided to distance myself from her. P said it was just an innocent joke and she didn’t mean to flirt with my crush (P has a long distance girlfriend, and is a type of person who loves getting attention). i just didn’t trust her anymore.

my contact with my crush was not consistent. i feel like she isn’t much of a texter, since her texting energy is very different from her in real life energy. her replies took longer and i felt like i was the one who put more effort into starting convo’s through text with her. after 2 days of no contact, she texted me how i was doing, and invited me to her birthday hangout with her friends to have some drinks together. sadly i couldn’t join her that day because i already had plans with my friends. 

current time: sometimes we have long convo’s where she would stay online and reply right away but often times she would take hours to reply. i know she is a busy person, she has internship, work, her own social life, study, and hobbies. but i feel like if someone truly likes another person or is interested in them, they would make time for them right? i’m just not sure whether to tell this girl i like her and want to ask her out on a date and see how it goes from there. i mean i don’t even know her for that long, maybe 4-5 weeks now? at this point i feel like i just want to know if she is interested in me too, and have an answer. i really dislike having crushes on people in general, and sometimes i can’t focus on anything else. i should be focusing on my thesis but instead i’m like daydreaming about her, which is frustrating. what do you guys advise me to do? should i tell her, or should i get to know her better with time and take it slow? if i want to ask her out on a date, how should i do it? through text or in person? i just don’t want it to make too heavy, i want it to stay lighthearted and casual, without confessing any feelings. i just want to take her out on a date, that’s all. 

ps. i know she is single; she recently broke up with her girlfriend. i don’t know much about her past relationship with her ex, and i don’t know why they have broken up and if she is over her ex. ",1,1740257232.0,actuallesbians,4,1.0,False

Did I ruin our friendship?,"I (22M) have this one friend (25F) to whom I'm really fond of. Their company used to be very welcoming and we were very close. She has a lot of issues and daily stresses to deal with, and would always find me for support, to which I would always gladly give support, too, because I really enjoy having her around.

A while ago, however, I started having family issues, university issues and a lot of things started going South in my life. I've tried to see whether I could get her support for that, and found out she was not able to help me with everything going on with her life, which is fair IMO. This went on for some months until I looked at myself and found me in a position where I can't have any conversation with her at all without it delving into her ranting about work, employment and general bad living conditions we as Gen-Z are all facing at the same time. I tried my best to always be there, knowing how important it might be for someone to have a place to vent. But I will be honest to say that I got a bit fed up since I felt as if my own very real issues weren't even a thought to her.

I texted her about how I'm facing a lot of stress from my work, family and university, and how the day I texted her was actually the only day in that week in which I even had lunch; talked about how I will feel like a shit friend knowing I won't be able to support her the way I really wish I could. I asked for some space until I sorted my end of the stuff, which I said would take a month, and that I will do my best to sort everything I can.

She didn't reply to that message, which I'm fine. As of yesterday, I grabbed my phone to aske whether she wants to get some coffee at this new shop I found near our places and give each other some update, just to see their pfp disappear and my message not received. Checked their Instagram and found myself blocked from it, too.

I don't really think reaching through SMS is the way to solve it - though tempting -, and I'm feeling very awkward now with the whole situation, since we don't have mutual friends that I feel comfortable enough to ask them about this.

I feel sad about this while at the same time I feel a bit betrayed and angry that, at first glance, the only thing I asked was some space to deal with myself. Considering how I've always been there for her, I felt a sense of unfairness.

Is there any better way out of this other than accepting that maybe the other person didn't think too fond of me to begin with? I really want to talk to them and sort things out, but I know dialogues can only happen when both parties are willing to conduct it.

Seems like when I'm done, he finds a way to not have to leave. Things have been going good between us and it was starting to feel hopeful. Yesterday I overheard him telling his boss that he was just trying to get closure with us before he makes his next move, which really hurt.

I found where he had texted her when we were fighting last month after not talking to her for over a year. He told her he was very unhappy with me and that I was ""deeply manipulative"", wanting to get a cup of coffee with her once he leaves me. Obviously I'm not happy about that either. The ordeal I refer to is the affairs he had with the 2 women he worked with. Since this happened last night, we have slept in separate rooms and not talking to each other at all.

1ivsh0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1ivsh0m/how_to_find_a_girlfriend_as_an_introvert_27m/,How to find a girlfriend as an introvert? (27M),"I,(27M), have never been in a relationship and have a very small social circle, very few friends.

During my college days, some women showed interest in me, 2 even asked me out but I never reciprocated because it didn’t feel like I needed someone to spend my time with as I mostly liked to spend my time with few friends I had then.

I’m growing older and reality is hitting me that I do need someone to share my thoughts and time with. I need someone to share experiences and have fun with, travel and explore places and get opinions on random things about life from someone who truly knows me.

Reasons I can’t find any one
1. I do not go out a lot, home, office and then back home and I am also not particularly attracted to any girl at work and do not want to date any one at work because I plan to switch or go for higher education and even without this I would like to date someone outside of work.

2. Making an online profile seems very overwhelming because it seems a lot of work to take good clicks, make a profile, go through rejections and maybe then find a few good dates (would be my first date ever) and then find someone I’d wanna spend time with.

I am looking for a relationship, (even a casual one that has potential to turn into something meaningful), not casual sex or hookups as I believe I am not cut out for that.

I am somewhat confident that I am a mildly desirable guy, because few girls themselves initiated casual and flirty conversations with me during college days and asked my friends about my status (no I am not assuming that any girl who talks to me casually, likes me, but in college few girls did explicitly showed interest and I didn’t reciprocate, I was an idiot?)

Some things have changed about me in last 4-5 years, like worried about my career/higher ed, very slight change in looks(not negative), gained slight amount of muscle, but I also have gotten more distant from all friends because of my other personal and family problems and everyone being busy in their own jobs.

I still do get casual compliments from friends at work more often than not, about my style, maturity, smartness and people are often curious about this part of my life.

I also had a thing for a girl at work few years back, we became good friends, but only I used to initiate talks, made small plans like going for coffee etc but I did not escalate things with her because I had heard rumours she was seeing some else and they turned out to be true. I am glad I never asked her out and she even left the firm some time back.

I really do want to be in a fun and happy relationship. What can I do to find a gf? Are dating apps the only option? I don’t like them as I don’t think I’d be able to connect with someone online like I could offline. Also, does not being in a relationship ever before make me undesirable? I am also not sure that whats so drastically different about me now that I was attractive to women only during my college days and not any more?

Sorry if I sound too narcissistic but I am a very self aware guy in general.

I just love how people enjoy coffee and for the most part let other people enjoy it, too. It's such a cozy feeling to have a warm cup of coffee. If you are ever in a stressful situation, it's not uncommon for someone to offer you a water or a coffee.

I'm doing some web training right now, and the instructor will often end two part videos with the encouragement to walk around a grab a cup of coffee. I find myself wanting a cup of coffee just because it's offered.

I also like that meeting for coffee is such a low stress activity. If you want to meet for lunch? Thats a bigger plan. But grab a cup of coffee together? Sure! Why not. You can literally grab a cup of coffee and leave after 5 minutes or after 45 minutes and its low pressure.",7,1740256191.0,CasualConversation,9,0.89,False

I am enjoying my time in Rome but am starting to feel a little disconnected purely as a tourist. I always preferred connecting with locals, cheap street foods, social experiences, exoticism, etc (I know, I know, I should go to SEA but am trying to take a break from visiting there).  
I have decent income but tend to prefer cheaper experiences such as the above stated\^ as someone who is naturally pragmatic. Heck, the most fun that I have had in Italy so far is engaging with other random travelers and eating pizza!  
\-I am naturally very friendly and have no problem approaching total strangers and striking up conversation, but I have noticed that this doesnt go super far in many touristic European cities. Im just another tourist in their eyes (thinking about places such as Rome, Budapest, Prague).  
\-I do like coffee and good cheap foods. Italy is doing alright in that regard, excellent coffee (even mcdonalds is blowing my mind!) and we can call pizza a street food for all intents and purposes.  
\-I do like nightlife when its affordable, accessible, and has friendly people. But I wont pay huge cover charges and endure long lines.

\-I dont like museums at all (is it just me or do most paintings and statues look very similar to one another?).  I did enjoy visiting St Peter's Cathedral in Vatican city but had no real interest in the individual items/art/statues etc there. Ive seen so many before... I declined to pay money for the Vatican museums. I can appreciate being in old-world architecture but feel like I have had enough in Rome after a few days. It wont replace interacting and social experiences!  
\-I dont drink alcohol and have no appreciation for wine.  
\-Coastlines are great when they are high-up and scenic but I am not the kind of person who enjoys lying around on a sunny flat sandy beach or even swimming all that much. I wanted to go to amalfi this trip but rains are pouring in so not this time.  
\-I like nature in general and am a big mountain hiker  
\-I probably wont rent a car unless its super cheap but am not opposed to a scooter. I have a motorcycle license in the USA. Zipping around on a scooter is quite fun for me as it lends independence and intimacy in transportation and site-seeing.

I'd appreciate ideas on where to go. I have been leaning slightly towards Spain but thats subjective and unreliable. I speak well-enough Spanish and have heard more about it. If I went to spain, Im eyeing good weather ares considering it will be March, such as Seville, Granada, and Barcelona. I know honestly nothing about Portugal.",0,1740256146.0,travel,10,0.5,False

Foods high in carotene or A like eggs dairy tomatoes give me the same dry-sinus dry-eyes migraine. Also last summer my doctor pointed out I looked slightly orange, this was after months of eating lots of eggs and vegetables.

The Vitamin a toxic are highly sensitive to choline and cholinergics too (look up the Reddit posts of people going suicidal on alpha-gpc). Choline and v.A share the similarity of being highly methylated compounds.

Impaired bile flow, and copper buildup are common liver problems that worsen the condition. Calcium deficiency and elevated PTH is seen due to A’s antagonism of D3

I’ve noticed when I regularly use a bile acid sequesterent like psyllium husk or even beans my sense of smell gets really strong, like smelling a croissant or a cup of coffee from the other side of the room. I had zero sense of smell back when I ate tons of eggs.

There’s definitely something to this, I suggest reading the experiences on the low toxin forum and ggenereux forum.

That next Saturday, we went out for a “friendly date” (yes, let’s call it that). She drove all the way from Manila to Cavite, since i visited Mom — such dedication, right? She pulled up in her new car, looking all soft masc and ridiculously good-looking, like she just walked out of a K-drama. Seriously, how does she do that?! 🙃

We went for coffee at Hiraya, and to my surprise, the place wasn’t crowded at all. Perfect. Just us, a great view, and my coffee that somehow tasted better with her around. We started talking about life after “us,” and you know what? It was such a happy conversation—light, effortless, like no time had passed.

She was still the same “S” (yep, let’s call her that). Quiet in a group but all-out chatty when it’s just the two of us. She told me about her promotion, how much she loves her job, how well her boss treats her. And honestly? I was so proud. It hit me then—our breakup was actually one of the best decisions we ever made. Because if we hadn’t chosen ourselves back then, would we have grown this much?

Then came lunch. We had bulalo—her absolute favorite. But me? I was lowkey eyeing sinigang. Still, I wanted to spoil her that day, just like old times. And let me tell you, watching her eat was the cutest thing ever. She demolished three cups of rice like a champ! 😆 I swear, it took me right back to our KFC days—two-piece chicken, three cups of rice, no leftovers. And yet, she’s still all slim and soft masc fine.  **Life is all unfair. How can she stay that slim?**

But here’s the thing—I wasn’t sitting across from her reminiscing about the past, wishing for a do-over. I was just… happy. Happy that we both turned out okay. Happy that we both grew. And most of all, happy that we could still share a meal, a laugh, and a moment of genuine appreciation for each other.

Sometimes, love isn’t about holding on—it’s about knowing when to let go so you can both grow.  Realizing that love shifted, it changed, but it never lost its warmth. It's now a different kind of love, a love that stepped back but will always root for you from afar. 💕

And honestly? I wouldn’t change a thing.",1,1740255767.0,PHSapphics,1,0.67,False

I will be moving next week, so I decided to send him a text asking how he is and if he wanted to get a coffee or something before I leave. We both have iPhones but I noticed it turned into a green text bubble and was never delivered, so I can only assume he blocked my number.

I'm mainly looking for something I can experiment with, I like to buy roasts of every level, but I have a standard bean that I can always count on for a decent brew. This is also what my wife prefers.

Therefore I need some advice on what machines might allow me to have some kind of presets for my wife to tamp and go, but also allowances for me to tinker. The robot allowed me to change a lot of variables, which is what I wanted from it, but my wife has no interest in learning the intricacies but still wants a nice brew :D

To be honest, I think I am looking for a unicorn but here are my requirements:

* Something with adjustable heating so I can play with different roasts (like I can do with the robot)
* Ability to have presets which take as much of the ""manual"" brewing away from the process as possible (tamp and go), so I can dial in the coffee and wife can make use of that preset
* I'm trying to keep it as mechanical as possible. I want this thing to last a long time and not be dragged down by an app being discontinued or proprietary code/hardware (looking at you Linea Mini with your brew-by-weight scale lock-in).
* Something that heats up pretty fast, we would brew 5 cups a day roughly but don't want it on constantly as we are pretty variable in how much we drink
* Serviceable in Australia

I am currently contemplating the following:

* Lelit Bianca - Seem like a good mix, cannot preset any of the settings? Please correct me if wrong!
* Decent/(Decent Bengle?!) - Loud? Looks nice, has the software ""issue"" though
* Marzocco mini - Seems like a fairly good choice, dont like the way jiggler feels and is set
* Unica Pro (this might be a little hard for me to get) - Looks nice, has the software ""issue"" though
* Anything from Rocket?
* Open to any other brands I've not mentioned, I am slowly discovering new brands daily

“I want a divorce.” I said, but there was no response.
“I said I want a divorce.” I repeated louder this time, clenching my fists at my sides.
Alpha Dante finally looked up from his desk, staring at me like I had come to throw another tantrum.
“You are tired. Go and have a nap or something,” he said dismissively. I bit down on my lips and, in annoyance, slammed the divorce papers I had secretly gathered on his desk.
“What is this?” he muttered in irritation, flipping through the papers.
“These are the divorce papers. I have my signature already on them. All that’s left is your signature.” His brow furrowed, and his jaw clenched. Then suddenly, he tore the papers into shreds, causing me to gasp.
“What… what do you think you are doing? I spent months gathering that… why would you…”
“I will not divorce!” His voice thundered, causing me to flinch. He tossed the shredded papers across the room. “You are my wife. The Luna of the Moonshade Pack. How dare you ask for a divorce?”
“What more do you want? You’ve caused me nothing but pain for the past three years,” I found myself yelling in anger. “You’ve had your revenge. My father's dead and you took over his pack. What more do you want? Why won’t you let me go? Why…”
“It’s not enough!” he cut me off. “Your pain is not enough! You cannot be happy while I am unhappy! You will remain unhappy by my side forever,” he said, now standing, his voice filled with nothing but disdain.
I let out a shaky breath. Who was he? This wasn’t the man I had fallen in love with. This wasn’t the man who held me close on cold nights, who whispered sweet nothings in my ear, who promised to protect me from all harm. No, this was a stranger—a monster wrapped in the same familiar body. I shook my head in disbelief, my heart pounding in my chest. How had we come to this?
“I, Amaya Blackwood…”
“Don’t you dare, Amaya!” he said, taking steps forward while I took more back.
“…of the Moonshade pack reject you…”
“Amaya!” he yelled, closing the distance as I slammed my back against a wall. His hand gripped my jaw, his red eyes glowing as he stared at me while I glared back at him.
“Divorce me, Dante,” I muttered, breathing heavily, but his grip only tightened around my jaw, so tight that it felt like he could actually crush it any moment. “Please… let me go.”
“Never!” he growled. “I will never let you go, Amaya. Even if you hate me.”
We continued staring at each other, panting heavily, until I looked away. Only then did his grip loosen, and he took a step back.
“Now return to your room, and don’t you ever think about something as absurd as divorce again, because it’s never going to happen.”
I paused by the door, my grip tightening around the doorknob, but I said nothing.
As I was returning to my room, I was so lost in thought that I bumped into someone by the stairs.
“Oh, sorry,” I muttered, and when I looked up, I saw that the man I bumped into was Cyrus, the son of my father’s Beta, Vaughn. His father was part of the revolution that had overthrown my father. Unfortunately, before my father was caught, Vaughn was shot in the heart by my father. He did not survive.
“Watch where you are going,” he sneered. I lowered my head and continued walking, but then he added, “The Alpha received a marriage proposal.”
I froze, gripping the hem of my dress.
He continued, “She’s an amazing woman. One of our best warriors. The people love her and approve of them as a couple. Do you know what this means?” He turned to me with a smug look, expecting a disapproving response.
Instead, I smiled warmly. “Ah yes, they do seem like a perfect match. I already asked Dante for a divorce, but he refused. You are his close friend. I am sure you would be able to convince him to take the proposal seriously.”
His smug look faltered, and he looked at me confused. “You are giving up so easily?” he said, and now I was the one who was confused.
“What else can I do? He’s made it clear that I have no say in my own life. If this marriage proposal is what’s best for the pack, who am I to stand in the way?”
He frowned, and when he didn’t say anything else, I turned away.
When I got to my room, I closed the door behind me and let out a shaky breath as I recalled Cyrus’s words.
The pack adored their new Alpha. After all, he had saved them from misfortune. Kara was also everything I wasn’t—strong, beloved, and loyal to the pack. She had fought alongside Dante for the freedom of the pack. It was only natural for them to be together. They were a perfect match, and I was sure the people would pressure Dante to accept.
But what did that mean for me? Would I be finally free? No, that wasn’t possible. I was the last remaining royal bloodline of the Moonshade pack. The people hated me. They wanted me gone, and Dante would never let me go. Even if he moved on, he would keep me as a prisoner.
I sighed and walked over to the window. My eyes widened for a brief moment when I saw Dante and Kara walking side by side. They were talking about something, and he was smiling. But then it all vanished as he shifted his gaze and his eyes met mine.
A shiver ran down my spine, but I couldn’t look away. So we just stared at each other until Kara tugged at his sleeve, urging him to focus on her. He glanced back at her with the same warm smile, and they both walked away.
“Should I jump?” was the first thought that came to my head as soon as they were out of sight. I could run as far as my legs could carry me. But where would I go? Who was I kidding? Dante had allies everywhere while I had no one. My parents were gone, their loyal followers were either scattered or dead. I was alone.
Chapter 2
I woke up the next morning with a very high fever, but I still managed to get out of bed. Outside my bedroom window, I could hear chants from protesters who wanted me gone from the pack. This had become a routine; they did it every morning until they were chased away by the guards.
I got dressed and headed downstairs to join Dante for breakfast. Although I didn’t want to, he had insisted, not giving me much of a choice.
So, against my will, I had to see him every morning before he left the packhouse.
Today was different, though. Kara was sitting at the breakfast table, smiling as she poured Dante a cup of coffee.
“Good morning, Amaya,” she said, as if she wasn’t sitting in my house, at my table, sharing coffee with my husband while I sat at the far end, away from both of them.
“Good morning,” I muttered, keeping my eyes down.
Dante, on the other hand, didn’t look up. He was busy reading something on his tablet.
“Amaya, you look pale,” she added just as I was about to take a bite of my sausage. “Are you not feeling well?”
I looked at her, caught off guard. There was no way she would care. That was confirmed when I saw pity in her eyes, and my walls went back up.
As if on cue, Dante looked up from his tablet, his gaze meeting mine, waiting for my response.
“I…I’m fine,” I muttered.
“If you’re fine, stop sulking,” Dante said coldly.
“Dante,” Kara scolded. “Why are you being harsh? She doesn’t look well.”
“She’s the daughter of a powerful Alpha. I’m sure her wolf will heal her,” he said.
And he would be right, except I had lost contact with my wolf as a result of the trauma. It was like she just vanished. Perhaps that was another reason I couldn’t feel the mate bond, and that was why his words hurt less.
“But…” Kara tried to insist, but he cut her off.
“Fine…I will get the pack healer.”
“No, it’s not necessary. It’s just a fever.” I tried taking a bite of the sausage, but the smell made me nauseous, and I put it back down. “Excuse me,” I said, standing up.
“Where are you going?” Dante asked.
“I’m not hungry,” I replied. Not waiting for his response, I turned and walked out of the dining room.
In the corner, I could see some maids giggling as I walked by. I knew it was about me, but I could do nothing but continue walking.
Later that evening, Dante informed me I would be joining him for a party. My dress had already been picked out, and all I had to do was be there, in his words.
It was difficult walking in heels. I had mentioned this in the past, but I guess he had forgotten—or perhaps he only pretended to care back then.
I felt dizzy due to my rising fever, yet I had to shake it off for the sake of this occasion.
As soon as we entered, all eyes fell on us. My hand was wrapped around his, and I could feel my grip tightening because of how nervous I was, which was weird because I was always the confident one.
When we walked in, a man approached us with a smile and extended his hand to Dante.
“Alpha Dante, it’s a pleasure to meet you,” he said while completely ignoring my presence.
“Always good to see you, Mark,” he said, returning the handshake.
I stood there awkwardly as the two men continued to talk. The man didn’t even glance in my direction, making me feel like an outsider.
After a while, I slowly released my grip and took a small step back, then another, until I had created some distance between us—but I could still hear their voices.
“So, Alpha, why didn’t you accept the marriage proposal?” he asked, as if I wasn’t in the room with them.
“I’m not sure where that rumor came from. I already have a wife,” Dante said, laughing, catching me off guard. But I quickly reminded myself it was probably just to save face.
After a while, the show started, and I was back at Dante’s side. It was a live band playing one of my favorite songs. I closed my eyes as memories from years ago flooded back—when I used to perform on stages, traveling on tours. But after the incident, it felt like I lost my voice.
“Luna, didn’t you use to sing?” I heard a voice from among the crowd, and my eyes snapped open.
“Yes! Why don’t you sing for us?” another said.
“Wait…what…I…” I tried to speak, but they cut me off.
“Come on, one song! Don’t be shy. You’ve earned many awards for your singing.”
It was true, but right now, I couldn’t.
Before I could protest, a woman grabbed my hand forcefully and pulled me to the stage, handing me a mic.
I stood in front of the stage, staring at the crowd in front of me. This was nothing compared to the hundreds of people I had sung in front of in the past, but back then, they didn’t look at me with such disdain.
“Sing!”
They urged, while my heart raced. In the crowd, I could see Dante staring at me expectantly.
I opened my mouth, but no words came out.
I just couldn’t.
A sudden wave of dizziness hit me, making my body sway slightly. My skin was burning up, but at the same time, I felt so cold that my fingers were trembling.
Gosh, I should have stayed back at home. My head was pounding and my legs felt like they weren’t even mine anymore.
“I…I…sorry. I…” I tried to say, but my vision suddenly blurred, and the next thing I knew, the room was tilting. No, I was falling.
The last thing I saw was an image of Dante’s wide eyes as he rushed toward me, but everything went black before I could see if he caught me.
When I opened my eyes, I was lying in my bed.
“Don’t move,” a voice said sternly. It wasn’t Dante’s—it was the pack’s healer.
I blinked, watching him mix something in a small bowl. “You collapsed at the party,” he explained, not looking at me. “I can’t believe the Alpha called me for something so trivial. There are people in this pack who genuinely need my help, not…” his words trailed off.
I stared at the window. My throat was dry, and my head was aching like crazy. I wanted to close my eyes, but the healer continued muttering.
“Honestly, wasting my time on someone who’s probably just fine. It’s not like I have better things to do,” he said, as if I wasn’t lying right next to him.
The room fell silent. After a few minutes, the door opened, and Dante stepped in.
“What happened?” he asked the healer.
“Nothing serious,” the healer said, waving his hand dismissively. “She’s been indoors too much. Likely a mix of stress and low energy. She’ll be fine after some rest and sunlight.”
Dante crossed his arms. “She fainted in the middle of a party. That’s not nothing.”
But the healer only sighed in frustration. “Alpha, I’ve told you what I think. If you don’t trust my judgment, perhaps you’d like to consult someone else. As I said, she just needs rest.”
Dante’s jaw clenched as he thought for a moment. “Leave,” he ordered.
The healer wasted no time gathering his things before leaving the room.
When the door shut, the room fell silent again. I didn’t dare look at Dante—I was still staring at the ceiling—but I could feel his presence close.
“Why didn’t you say anything earlier?” he finally asked.
I closed my eyes as the headache worsened.
“I’m fine,” I whispered.
There was another wave of silence between us until I heard his footsteps retreating, followed by the door closing. Only then did I open my eyes.
I managed to sit up and opened my drawer, picking up a bag containing pills. I grabbed the bottled water I always had next to my bed and gulped down the medicine.
Without taking this, I wouldn’t be able to sleep.
Chapter 3
The next days that followed, I started noticing Dante more often in the house than before. Although we never truly had a proper conversation, he wasn’t yelling like he used to.
“My husband has been really cold and distant lately.”
I overheard a conversation between two maids while I was walking down the hallway. They were whispering, but I could hear them clearly.
“Do you have a child yet?” the older maid asked while the younger one shook her head.
“I wanted to wait, but now… I don’t know. Maybe it was a mistake. He’s barely home, and when he is, it feels like we’re strangers.”
“Ah, that’s just what happens with newlyweds. Men get restless, but trust me, once you give him a child, everything will change. He’ll return to his loving self. That’s how it’s always been.”
I froze upon hearing those words. A child? Was that the answer?
But Dante had never asked for one, which is why I never even considered it.
But now… maybe… just maybe.
That night, I found myself standing in front of Dante’s office, debating whether to knock or not. Just then, the door opened, and he stepped out. He looked surprised when he saw me there.
His gaze shifted from my head to my toes. I was wearing a slightly transparent nightgown, but at the last minute, I had thrown a robe over it.
“Dante,” I whispered. “Are you busy?”
We had done this many times in the past. Whenever he wanted it, he would come to my room. But for the past year, he had stopped coming. I assumed he had grown tired of me. So, I never made a move—until now.
“If you are not busy, I was thinking…” I tugged on his shirt, silently praying he wouldn’t reject me.
To my surprise, he grabbed my wrist and pulled me inside, shutting the door behind him with a quiet click. My heart pounded in my chest.
I reached for the tie of my robe, but before I could even pull it off, his lips crashed onto mine.
He gripped me firmly, holding me in place as his mouth moved against mine.
It felt like he was desperate. But even then… his kiss felt cold.
Before I could even think, his hands were already at the tie of my robe, and it pulled open. It fell from my shoulders, and I stood there in just my nightgown and nothing underneath.
He didn’t waste time, grabbing the hem of my nightgown and pulling it over my head.
Now I was standing before him, nervously fidgeting with my fingers.
His eyes darkened for a brief second before his expression went blank again.
“Lie down,” he commanded.
Without a second thought, I moved toward the bed, doing exactly what he told me to.
The next morning, when I woke up, I was sore all over. Dante wasn’t in the room. He had left that same night as soon as he was done.
Gosh, I regretted it instantly.
Last night, although filled with pleasure, was emotionless. He didn’t utter a single word or make a single sound.
Even when he released inside of me. Nothing. It felt like a machine doing its job, even worse than before.
It took me a while to pick myself up and return to my room. And after that day, I saw less and less of Dante.
He was always busy with work and even missed our usual morning breakfasts together.
Two months passed in the blink of an eye, and nothing really changed.
“I want to go to the beach,” I suddenly brought it up during breakfast.
“I will arrange for us to go this weekend,” he said, looking at his phone.
“No… just me. I want to go alone,” I said, and his eyes instantly snapped up to meet mine.
“You want to go alone?” he repeated. “Why? Who do you want to meet?”
“Why do you assume I want to meet someone?” I asked, but I was met with a cold glare, causing me to swallow nothing.
“I heard your friend is in town.”
He was talking about Ryder, my childhood best friend who had confessed his love to me in the past, but I had turned him down to be with Dante. Although I was aware he was in town, he still wasn’t the reason I was going to the beach.
“I just want some time alone. I have been locked inside for too long. Didn’t the healer say that I needed more sunlight and fresh air?” I reminded him.
He glared at me, then nodded. “Fine, I will make arrangements for a guard to accompany you.”
Even though I wanted to argue, I knew it was pointless, so I nodded.
That weekend, I went to the beach alone. Well, not alone. The guard was following me but from a distance.
I inhaled the salty air and watched the crashing waves. I played in the sand and picked shells, trying to remind myself of the good old days.
Sitting on the floor, I thought about Dante again. I missed him—or at least the version of him that I had married.
I was so lost in my thoughts that I didn’t notice the guard moving closer.
Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my back as a knife was plunged deep into my skin.
I gasped, and before I could scream, he yanked the knife out, whispering, “The Blackwood family deserves to die.”
A shiver ran down my spine, but before I could react, he raised the knife again, preparing to strike.
“Hey!” A fisherman spotted us and shouted, rushing towards us and raising alarm.
The guard, realizing he had been caught, ran away while I collapsed on the floor, struggling to breathe.
“Stay with me, miss,” the fisherman panicked, reaching out for his phone.
Ah! He didn’t recognize me. Thank God. If he did, he would have also left me to die.
But even that didn’t stop me from losing more blood until I lost consciousness.
Chapter 4
Dante’s POV
I was at a pack meeting when I got the call that Amaya had been stabbed—by not just anyone, but one of my own men.
“What?” I barked into the phone, startling the Alphas around me. My heart pounded violently in my chest, and for the first time in years, true fear gripped me.
I left immediately, shifting into my wolf and racing toward the hospital. By the time I arrived, I was breathing heavily, and my hands were shaking.
The doctor was waiting for me.
“The wound was deep,” he started. “She lost a lot of blood. It will take at least a month for her to fully recover.”
I frowned. “A month?” That didn’t make sense. With her wolf, she should be healed in a week at most.
“There’s… something else.” The doctor hesitated.
“Spit it out,” I growled.
“Your wife was weeks pregnant, Alpha… but she lost the child due to the trauma.”
Everything stopped.
A ringing in my ear drowned out all other sound, and my eyes turned red. The doctor’s mouth was still moving, but I couldn’t hear him.
Pregnant? Amaya was pregnant?
My body moved before I could think, and I grabbed the doctor by the collar, slamming him against the wall.
“You’re lying,” I snarled, my claws digging into his chest while my wolf howled in agony, wanting to break free. “She wasn’t pregnant! She would have told me!”
“It’s still in the early stages… she must not have—”
“She did this on purpose, didn’t she?” I cut him off. “She didn’t tell me because she planned to leave! She was going to run off with Ryder, wasn’t she?”
I couldn’t think straight. This was Amaya’s fault. She had been distant, she wanted to go to the beach alone. She had let her guard down…
I shoved the doctor away and turned, my fists clenched so tightly that my nails dug into my skin.
When she woke up, I confronted her about the news, but she just stared at me, emotionless like she usually did. Even now, she felt no remorse. She didn’t shed a single tear, and that annoyed me. I gritted my teeth and stormed out of the room.
The guard who had stabbed her was still on the run, so after she was discharged, I had her quarantined in her room.
She wasn’t allowed to step out for anything, but just in case, I stationed two guards outside and monitored the maids going in and out of her room.
All her meals and drinks had to go through me before they reached her. I wasn’t taking any chances.
If she wanted to act emotionless, fine. But I wasn’t going to let her make another mistake—wasn’t going to let her run away or get the freedom she wanted because of her reckless decisions.
For days, she barely spoke. She ate without complaint, bathed, and slept as if nothing had happened. Her indifference made me angry.
Did she not care that she had lost our child?
As for the guard who had stabbed her, I personally hunted him down.
Kneeling before me, covered in dirt and blood, he trembled as he dared to meet my gaze. His lips quivered as he spoke.
“I was doing you a favor, Alpha,” he choked out. “The Blackwood… they all deserve to die. She’s a—”
I snapped his neck before he could finish. Though I felt I should have tortured him, should have made him suffer, I couldn’t waste another second on a traitor who thought he had the right to decide my fate.
Wiping the blood off my hands, I turned to my men. “Burn his body. Let it be a warning to anyone else who dares to defy me.”
They bowed their heads in obedience, dragging the corpse away.
That night, I headed straight to her room unannounced to deliver the news. She was sitting by the window, staring at the moon, and didn’t turn around when I entered.
“He’s dead,” I said.
She didn’t respond.
I clenched my fists, stepping closer. “I hunted him down myself. Snapped his neck like the traitor he was.”
Still nothing.
My jaw tightened. “Is that all you’re going to do? Just sit there and stare at moon like nothing happened?”
Finally, she turned her head slightly. I flinched when I saw the emptiness in her eyes—she looked like a living corpse.
“What do you want me to say, Alpha?”
“You lost our child,” I growled, taking another step forward. “And you sit here as if you feel nothing.”
Her lips pressed into a thin line. “What do you want me to do? Cry? Scream? You already decided this was my fault.”
I scoffed. “Isn’t it?”
She lowered her head. “Of course. Everything is always my fault.”
My blood boiled, and I grabbed her by the arm, yanking her to her feet. “Don’t play games with me.”
“Then let go.”
I gritted my teeth, staring down at her, but then my eyes widened when my gaze reached her fingers—I saw her ring was missing.
“Your ring… You took it off.”
She looked at her hand, and when she saw it wasn’t there, she muttered, “Oh.”
Oh. Just an oh. Even though I hated her, I never took off my ring. It was the only reminder of what we once shared.
“That’s it?” I snarled. “You take off our bond like it meant nothing, and all you can say is ‘oh’? If you hated me this much, you should have just left.”
Her lips curved into a small, bitter smile. “Didn’t I try?”
“You—”
“But you wouldn’t let me, so why are you surprised? You chained me to you. Did you really think a ring would change that?”
“That’s enough,” I said, shutting my eyes and shoving her back onto the bed. I took a step back, running a hand through my hair. “Put the ring back on.”
“No.”
“That wasn’t a request.”
“I can’t, because I didn’t take it off. It must have fallen off somewhere at the beach,” she said, turning back to face the window.
“I will go search for it,” I said, stepping back and running my hand through my hair.
She didn’t answer.
“Go to bed.” I clenched my jaw, and without another word, I left, slamming the door behind me.
Chapter 5
Dante POV
Five Years Ago – Flashback
“Did you sleep well?” I asked, running my fingers through Amaya’s silky hair as her head rested on my lap.
“No,” she pouted, turning her face up to look at me.
I smirked, brushing a loose strand behind her ear. “And why is that, princess?”
She huffed dramatically. “Because you weren’t there.”
It had only been a short mission—three days at the border—but she acted as if I had been gone for months.
I chuckled, trailing my fingers down her jaw. “I told you I’d come back.”
“You’re always leaving,” she muttered, crossing her arms. “And one day, you won’t.”
My smirk faltered. Amaya was the Alpha’s only daughter, raised in the safety of the packhouse, protected like an egg. She had never known real war, real danger. And yet, she feared losing me more than anything.
I gently tilted her chin up, forcing her to meet my gaze. “I will always come back to you.”
She blinked, her emerald eyes searching mine for a moment before she whispered, “Promise?”
I leaned down, brushing my lips against her forehead. “I swear it.”
A small smile tugged at her lips, but I could still see the hesitation in her eyes. She didn’t like my life as a soldier, didn’t like the bloodshed or the risks. But she loved me enough to endure it.
“Come with me next time,” she said, catching me off guard.
I raised a brow. “What?”
“On your next mission,” she said, propping herself up on her elbows. “I want to see what it’s like.”
I laughed, shaking my head. “Absolutely not.”
She scowled. “Why not?”
“Because you’re the Alpha’s daughter,” I reminded her. “And your father would have my head if I let you anywhere near danger.”
She rolled her eyes. “I’m not a child, Dante.”
“No, but you’re my princess,” I murmured, pressing a kiss to her palm. “And I won’t let anything happen to you.”
She sighed in frustration but didn’t argue further. Instead, she curled up against me, resting her head on my chest.
“Then don’t take so long next time,” she whispered, and I wrapped my arms around her, inhaling the familiar scent of lavender and honey.
End of Flashback
Ding!
Ding!
My phone vibrated, startling me out of my sleep. My neck was sore as I had dozed off at my desk. Glancing at my phone, I saw a message from Amaya.
I frowned.
“I’m sorry.”
I scoffed.
Sorry? She was apologizing? She should have done that sooner and made things easier for both of us, but she just had to be so stubborn.
I picked up my pen to continue signing some documents. But then 10 minutes passed and I found myself just flipping the pages.
“She never apologizes,” Mako, my wolf, said, and my hand froze.
It was true. Amaya had never been one to admit when she was wrong, even in the past. She had always been proud, but more than that, she had always been distant, keeping her emotions hidden.
Something wasn’t right.
I immediately grabbed my phone to call her, but the line went straight to voicemail.
I got up from my desk and sped past the hallway. There was no way she would have run away. She wouldn’t. She wouldn’t… she couldn’t.
When I got to her room, I saw two guards standing outside.
“Has she left her room?” was the first thing I asked.
“No, Alpha. In fact, she has been asleep for a while now. Told us not to disturb her,” one of them replied, and I sighed in relief.
Well, that was good. At least she was actually apologizing, but why did I still feel uneasy?
She hadn’t left. She was still here. But why wasn’t she answering me?
I opened the door, and the moment I stepped inside, I saw her lying in her bed. I breathed another sigh of relief.
“Something feels off,” Mako said.
I walked closer to her and bent down beside her bed. When I touched her, her skin was cold, causing me to catch my breath.
“Amaya,” I whispered, shaking her, but there was no response.
“Amaya!” I shouted, shaking her harder, but still, no response. She wasn’t waking up.
“No,” I whispered, backing away as my gaze shifted around the room, trying to pinpoint why—until it landed on her nightstand.
My blood ran cold when I saw them.
Scattered pills.
Not one. Not two. Dozens. And they were all empty.
My body froze as everything came crashing down.
No…
I stumbled back and rushed to her, shaking her violently this time. “Amaya! Wake up!”
My hands were shaking as I checked the pulse in her wrist. I felt a pulse… but it was weak. Too weak.
I turned to the guards at the door.
“Get the healer! Get the doctor, NOW!”
I watched the hours tick by as the healer worked on Amaya’s unconscious form. I stood by her bedside, clenching my fists while my wolf paced recklessly in my mind.
“She’s stable,” the healer finally said, wiping sweat from his brow. “But her body is weak. It will take time before she wakes up, so she must be monitored closely.”
I barely heard the last part before he bowed and left, leaving just the two of us alone.
Right now, she looked so pale… like a ghost. I can’t believe I hadn’t noticed it before.
I grabbed her wrist, feeling her faint pulse.
“Look what you’ve done,” I muttered.
How dare you try to leave me?
“Isn’t this what you wanted?” Mako taunted. “Our mate almost died. Aren’t you supposed to be happy? You wanted this, didn’t you?”
No.
I shook my head. My breathing was becoming heavier, so I had to step back, but I almost stumbled.
“I didn’t want her dead. I just… I just wanted her to suffer by my side.”
She can’t leave me. Never.
I won’t let that happen.
