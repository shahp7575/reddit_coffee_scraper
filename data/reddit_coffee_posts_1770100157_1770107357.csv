( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1qumje5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1qumje5/importance_of_second_endoscopy/,Importance of second endoscopy,"Hi everybody, 

I wanted to share my story in the hope that it might be of help.

2 years ago I started having severe stomach pain an nausea, relentless gerd and just feeling really bad overall. I adjusted my diet, quit alcohol and got an endoscopy done. By that time over 6 months had passed and the diagnosis was moderate chronic gastritis. Got prescribed PPI’s en was send home. 

I continued my diet and started making real progress. Symptoms got less and less and there were days where I did not think of my gastritis. That was until last summer. I was back to my normal diet (except for alcohol, never touching that shit again) but after a health scare, I’ve got massive health anxiety, and my symptoms started returning but this time is was much worse. Back on PPI but even those did not work. We had a lot on our plates and I just started feeling worse and worse. The anxiety that the gastritis was back and this time more severe was huge.

Late autumn I booked myself a second endoscopy, I had to know if something was off. I did the endoscopy, expecting the worst but the results came back normal. No inflammation, no gastritis, no inactive gastritis, nothing. I was completely shocked. The specialist in the hospital told me that it is extremely common to develop a form of functional dyspepsia after gastritis. He told me about the significance of the brain gut connection and how very real it is. I always read about it but never thought I could be this real.

Now, almost 3 months after the endoscopy I’m almost symptom free. Old trigger foods still hurt my stomach (coffee is still a big no no) but now I know it’s not gastritis that is causing the symptoms. Overall I feel 90% better compared to before the endoscopy.

I know the hell that everybody is going through, I know how demanding this condition can be on your mental health but maybe it can also be worth it to get that second endoscopy in and see how far you’ve come. 

By the end of this week I’m also going to say goodbye to Reddit. This subreddit has been of great help but the negativity that you encounter here as well has really pulled me to dark places over the last years. If anything my journey has taught me that everybody is unique and you have to follow your own path. I wish you all the very best, stay strong and hopefully make a full recovery.",1,1770107224.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False
1qumiu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qumiu7/im_confused_and_quite_dont_understand/,I'm confused and quite don't understand,"I'd like some advice on what I should/could do after this interaction with a girl I went on a ""date"" with.

I (25M) play volleyball at an open gym and ran into a girl (21F) whom I ended up taking to a date on Christmas Eve. It was the third time meeting her at the open gym (about a week prior to Christmas Eve) when I asked for her phone number. The sessions usually runs late and I just texted her it was me and to drive back home safe. 

Then comes the next day where I ask her what she is doing on Christmas Eve and she tells me that she isn't doing anything. So I asked her if she wants to get lunch/coffee with me. She says she would like to, and I tell her what time and where we are going to eat brunch at. 

Fast forward about a week to Christmas Eve, I pick her up at 11 am at her place. I should probably mention that I really haven't gone to any first dates, and I got really worried about what I was going to talk about once I pick her up. However, that concern went away as soon as she got in the car. She started the conversation and we kept talking. We got to the restaurant, got food, and shared a great conversation. 

We talked about college (she recently graduated from college), volleyball, her work, and a little bit about what my school life looks like (I also graduated college back in 2024, but I am in school once again for another thing.) The conversation pretty much kept going, back and forth, with a couple of awkward pauses that comes from when you're on a first date with someone but those didn't last long. 

After brunch, since I had planned to go to the gym after the date before I got to my part time job, I started to drive her back to her apartment. About half way there, she asked me if I wanted to do something else. So we went to a coffee shop that's near her apartment. 

We got coffee, sat down, and talked for another hour and a half where I really stretched on how long I could stay (because I had work.) After I dropped her off at the apartment, she told me that she had fun.

I couldn't text her right away because I had to get changed and leave straight to work, but I texted her that I had fun and that I would like to hang out again (something in this manner) after I got off work. 

Christmas day, no response, and the on the 26th, I text her asking how the Christmas party with her family went and what her volleyball plans were. She somewhat dryly responded that it was alright. She told me that she has a team play with her league team on Sunday.

I myself went to Sunday's volleyball open gym with my friends and ran into her after my session ended. This was after I got ghosted by her asking if she wants to get lunch with me before her session, but she declined saying that she had prior plans to get lunch with her parents. 

Seeing her at volleyball, we exchanged hellos, and a quick small talk. After seeing her at volleyball that Sunday, I did not see her again at the open gym, nor got a text back from her. 

  
What do you all think where this went wrong? I still cannot think of a single thing that could have went wrong in the 3 hour interaction I've had with her. ",2,1770107164.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Legend says the 12 New Year’s grapes sent me for good luck in love — so here I am. I’m not here to force anything or speedrun a relationship, but I am open to meeting someone genuine and seeing where things go.

**About me:**

* I love learning and sharing random facts
* Into cozy games like heartopia
* Pork sinigang, kare-kare, and kaldereta supremacy. Also love pasta
* Night owl energy —late-night conversations are my thing. (Yes, I’m trying to fix my sleep schedule na

**What I’m looking for:**

* Tall (>5’5)
* Someone kind, empathetic, and socially aware.
* A person with self-awareness and accountability—growth matters to me.
* Someone who enjoys good conversations, whether deep life talks or random nonsense.
* Someone who values quality time —going out, trying new things, or staying in with a movie.
* Physical attraction matters, so I’m open to swapping pics early on.
* NCR-based

**Random but important info:**

* Certified listener, but texts > calls (unless I really like you).
* Coffee lover. Iced >>> hot.
* Music taste ranges from Taylor Swift & Kanegi to Clairo & Sleep Token
* Soft spot for animals, especially strays. But can’t take care of one

If you want to see if we vibe — hit me up. Tell me a show you’re currently obsessed with, your favorite animal, or we can straight-up swap pics and go from there c:",1,1770106916.0,singleph,0,1.0,False
1qumg6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qumg6i/i_built_a_way_to_have_my_whole_laptop_in_my/,I built a way to have my whole laptop in my pocket (VS Code + Claude Code + Free Kimi 2.5 on iPhone/iPad),"I love my iPhone and iPad. They are beautiful and portable, but the moment I need to do ""real"" development work heavy compiles, Docker, or running complex AI agents—the dream usually dies. Web editors feel laggy, and mobile ""IDE"" apps often feel like toys compared to a pro desktop setup.

I wanted the real thing: **Full VS Code. Full Terminal. Local AI Agents.** I wanted to leave my heavy laptop at home but still have my entire dev environment ready at a moment's notice from a coffee shop, the train, or my couch.

So I built **Relay**. It's a low-latency bridge that connects your mobile device to your powerful machines (Mac, PC, or Cloud Server) with a native-feel interface that actually works.

[Screenshot from Rcode](https://preview.redd.it/7gdj5l9jn8hg1.png?width=2752&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c81102ff22bb729e85308b3811c8781ca3ba29d)

# What makes this different?

Most remote-access tools like Chrome Remote Desktop (CRD) just mirror a desktop screen you have to squint at. **Relay is a native, independent mobile runtime.** It stays lightweight on your device while treating your computer as a background ""resource bank"" to offload heavy tasks like **compiling, indexing, and complex AI processing.**

# 1. Workspaces (Multi-Machine support)

Most remote-access apps tie you to one machine. Relay is designed around **Workspaces**:

* **The Mac at Home**: Connect to your main rig for access to all your local projects and GPU.
* **Cloud Power**: Connect to an AWS or DigitalOcean instance for heavy-duty server work.
* **Switching is Instant**: Flip between your local Mac and a cloud Linux box effortlessly from your phone without losing your terminal state.
* **No Laptop? No Problem**: Relay includes a **basic native computing env** right in the app. It can run lightweight tasks and AI agent logic directly on your phone, so you're never completely stuck.

# 2. The ""Killer Feature"": Rcode Agent (Like Claude Code / Cursor)

[Claude Code](https://preview.redd.it/nvwx3yiun8hg1.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f8cddf64b5dcd6349a5f535bb7e355251771798)

I'm obsessed with agentic workflows. I wanted that ""Cursor"" power on my iPad, but since mobile Rcode doesn't support VS Code extensions yet, I had to build a native solution.

https://preview.redd.it/jsdcwrw1o8hg1.png?width=2126&format=png&auto=webp&s=d57158ac0485b2f0210b2ed75610c2cf7e22b07b

* **Supported by Claude Code & Kimi 2.5**: The Rcode Agent lives in your editor. Point it at a file, say ""refactor this,"" and it gets to work.
* **Free Kimi 2.5 (NVIDIA-Powered)**: I've included access to **Kimi 2.5** for free, right out of the box. No API keys or credit cards needed.
* **The Meta-Story**: I actually used **Claude Code** to help me build this feature. It assisted in architecting the terminal bridge and the autonomous logic. It's an agent built *by* an agent, *for* your mobile workspace.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1qumfa7,https://i.redd.it/fnlz47opn8hg1.jpeg,Weekly GoMining Update,"Yo GoMining crew! 👋

 Dropping my little weekly update cuz honestly, things are feeling pretty damn good right now.

Quick recap for anyone new: I'm running BTC mining with those digital miners (the NFT hashrate ones), using GOMINING (GMT) to cover maintenance for the discounts, and just trying to keep compounding and growing the setup.

This week's wins:

**Apple Pay with the card is straight fire;** Been loading up the GoMining Card and tapping away with Apple Pay for coffee, groceries, random stuff. Zero drama, works exactly like my regular debit card. Finally using crypto in the real world without headaches.

**That 1.5% bonus TH on every spend;**Every time I pay, boom: 1.5% cashback straight into mining power (extra TH/s on my hashrate). It's like free stacking on top of the daily BTC drops. When you're actually using the card a bunch, it adds up quicker than you'd think!

**Paying options are next level;** Can just spend from GMT, BTC, whatever's sitting in the wallet. No constant fiat on-ramping nonsense: super flexible.

**No fees? Absolute W;** No top-up fees, no sneaky BS charges. Makes spending feel normal instead of ""ugh, crypto tax/fees again.""

**BTC dipped hard this week so I YOLO'd reinvests;** Price tanked a bit (hovering around 78-79k now), so I grabbed all my mining rewards + extras and threw everything into more GMT and extra TH. Felt like the perfect moment to load up hashrate while it's cheaper. My total TH is creeping up nicely, can't wait to see what the next bounce does to payouts.

All in all, stoked with how it's going. The card stuff is turning GoMining from ""cool mining side thing"" into something I can actually live with daily.

Anyone else going hard on the card?",1,1770106776.0,gomining,0,1.0,False

The last year or so we sadly started drifting apart and it becomes apparent to me that there is no way back to how it used to be. Last year she avoided me for almost three months and when I asked if anything was wrong she waited almost a months to tell me how a comment I made, hurt her. I said something along the lines of that it’s insane that their new apartment is so much smaller but their rent is so much higher. 

I feel really bad for the comment, it really wasn’t nice of me and there is no excuse, I just shouldn’t have said that. So I apologised for hurting her feelings. 

I didn’t say anything about how hurt I felt that she didn’t tell me sooner, and instead met up with me for Pilates and Coffee only to ignore me the second another friend of hers randomly booked the same class. I didn’t say how hurt I felt that I would ask her if anything was wrong and she ignored me for a whole month. Because I thought well I really f\*\*\*\*\* up with this comment. 

In general I feel like I swallowed a lot in this friendship for the sake of the friendship. She would never introduce me to friends she made in the past couple of years, wouldn’t invite me to New Year’s Eve parties, wouldn’t even ask “because I was single and it would be boring for me” etc. Me on the other hand always made sure to ask her to attend plans, meet friends of mine etc. And I never said anything because well I felt like I couldn’t ask for things like that or felt stupid to make a big deal out of it. But deep down I just never felt appreciated and was wondering if she thought I wasn’t good enough. I felt like the long term friend who’s good enough for venting to about how shitty her life and her relationship is, but not good enough anymore to be an actual part of her life. 

Over the past year, she would frequently take weeks to reply, saying she was under a lot of stress at work. But as she still was proposing that we meet or do something together, I went along with it. Life gets busy, and I didn’t want to add to her stress, so I was always understanding and didn’t think anything of it. 

Before Christmas she told me day of an event we were planning to attend, and only after I asked her if we should grab dinner beforehand, that she wasn’t actually gonna make it, she was too tired and wouldn’t be back in our hometown until Christmas Eve. She apologised for telling me so late and promised she wanted to be a better friend in the new year. 

Fast forward to January, I asked her if she wanted to come to an event with me, the date came and went, no answer. My birthday came and went no birthday wishes. On Sunday, I tried one last time. I called her and she hasn’t gotten back to me yet.

I’m done with the friendship, she is done… but it still hurts and I don’t know if I should send her one last text and let her know how I feel. Just to end the chapter but I feel like a part of me still hopes she comes around but I think we’re done. I just never thought it would happen, especially like this. I just feel genuinely hurt and seeing how she treated me the past year and if I’m honest long before that just makes me want to tell her how I didn’t feel appreciated nor respected for a long time in our friendship and that I’m done. I just really don’t know what to do? Shall I tell her how hurt I am or just walk away in silence? I’m hoping if I tell her how I feel we can have a conversation. But I know it’s not going to happen.

1qumdhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qumdhe/toxic_threeway_dynamic/,Toxic three-way dynamic,"So I've realized how toxic I've been. Me (F31), my longtime friend (M30), let's call him Alex and a mutual friend (F40), let's call her Maya have this not great dynamic. Me and Alex have been best friends for a long time. We've gone through many ups and downs in our relationship. Alex and Maya are more recent friends. When things get bad Alex tends to block people for extended amounts of time. 

So back in May me and Alex had a falling out because he was dealing with a lot of stress in his life at that time. We got over it in time for his birthday, the night after his birthday party he was frustrated with Maya because he was stressed about life and wanted to talk with her but he wanted her to put her kids to bed so he could do so. She took offense to this but didn't tell him. Fast forward to a couple months later, Alex and Maya have a falling out. He was wanting to know what time to head to her place because she was going to help him to legal process a childhood SA incident. They had a falling out because he was impatient with her and she totally disregarded his childhood trauma. He blocks her. In the mean time I tell her he will unblock her and they will hash it out in time. 

Now with Maya I didn't know her well, she would occasionally ask if I could babysit her kids as she is a single mom. I would do so to be nice but I always wished she wouldn't ask. I recognize now my inability to say no was my problem, not hers. She paid me money and was always appreciative. I tried to develop a closer friendship and we had coffee a couple times. She's a nice person but she rants and and is always in some drama. I never felt like we jived but I never really knew how to back away from things.  

In the fall me and Alex had a falling out. He blocked me. I confided in Maya with it. I think she would try to get me to talk shit about Alex looking back. Amp me up. December, me and Alex make amends and we work out how we want the relationship to be better. He soon reaches out to Maya as well and they patch things up.

A few weeks ago, Maya got a puppy. She asked if I would puppy-not that weekend. I love dogs so I said yes. My god puppies are overrated, I'm so used to having an older dog i forgot how much work puppies are. Anyways, I invited Alex over to Maya's place since they were good now. I realize that Maya may not like me inviting other people so I ask her if Alex was asking if he can come over to see the puppy. She says she's not sure because she doesn't fully trust him and I say that's totally fine I can tell him that she doesn't want other people there when she's not. She says it's okay he can come but to let her know when he is coming. She doesn't want to deal with him being negative and judging her. Alex agrees to come and arrives late. I forget to let Maya know. Alex knocks the door too loudly and Maya lives in a townhouse. Neighbors ask her what is going on. Maya lives in subsidized housing and is very anxious about making sure she does not get evicted. She immediately calls and sends a barrage of irrate text messages to me on how I totally betrayed her. I didn't tell Alex what was going on but I was stressed and being very short with him which made him feel confused and hurt. I apologize to her the next morning and we talk on the phone and smooth things out, she apologized for her reaction and said she did in fact say it was okay for him to come over. I apologize for not telling her when he was coming and she largely blames Alex for knocking loudly and that she was right for feeling like she can't trust him. I didn't stand up for him on his behalf.

The next day, Alex messages that he's coming by because he left his bracelet there. It's a gem bracelet and he believes in crystal energy so it's important to him. I quickly tell Maya and she's immediately suspicious. He comes quickly grabs the bracelet and heads off. Maya texts me accusing me and him of making up this story just to hang out in his place to disregard her feelings of him being there. She then calls me about this very thing and that she's not stupid. I convince her that it had nothing to do with that and if she has cameras she can see for herself. She is then convinced and recognizes that she's projecting because of some other friend drama in her life with another friend. She calls later to tell me that she's late in getting back and then asks me for time stamps of when Alex texted and called and when he got there and compared it with her time stamps of when he called her as if she's suspicious of my story. When she gets back she's appreciative of me watching the puppy and gets me and uber and then apologizes for the way she acted. She then sent me a bunch of text messages apologizing and buys me a spa treatment.

Next day Alex calls asking what happened and I break down and tell him the whole situation. He tells me I need to separate my friendship with Maya because that situation was not okay and it made me really upset. A week later and I'm hanging out with Alex when Maya texts me asking to watch her kids so she could fly to LA to get some work done. I don't respond to the texts and she calls Alex who says I'm with him. She asks him to ask me as well. I don't answer my text messages. She responds that her neighbor would do it. She texts me also that she's so glad that me and Alex are hanging out again (referring to our friendship break) and that he really has a way of dragging people back in (referring to how me and her previously had conversations about our issues with him). I responded that ya but if we have issues again then that's it (which was kindof referencing me and Alex's makeup, but obviously I guess I was being underhanded in saying it that way because both me and him have our issues and I didn't mention to her any of mine).

I call her a few days later and I ask her how she's doing, she decided not to go to LA. We get onto the topic of the weekend and she says she felt bad for the way she handled things but only did so since she had told me she didn't want him there and says I didn't listen to her (despite her telling me at the time that it was okay to invite him). In hindsight I know I should've just asked her first before inviting him, she is still under the assumption that he had asked to come over. I try to navigate the conversation to be about how I'd like to set up boundaries and for her to not ask me to watch her kids unless there was an emergency. I said that I felt our relationship had been a bit transactional and i think it would be better if we were only a personal relationship where we just hung out without doing anything professional. She was on my resume for babysitting and i was her references for a grant. I also outlined that I felt an emergency would be like if she was in the hospital (I used this example because she's texted me she was in a crisis before and it ended up being she had no one to watch the kids while she gets a facial). She agrees and make plans to get facials and get coffee. Half an hour later I get a barrage of text messages and screenshots because she didn't like that I used the word transactional and she wanted to show every time she asked me to just hang out. It was also her saying how hurt she was, that friends be there for each other and that she constantly asks if she can help me (which she does i just don't need anything) and that she felt Alex was behind this and manipulating me. It totaled to 46 text messages. I don't read them for a couple days. Stressed me tf out.

A few days later I read the text messages and don't respond. I hang out with Alex and tell him all about it. He says I should just cut it off and block her. He helps me craft a message, I make it my own and send it, blocked her. He leaves and he gets a text from Maya that apparently I was talking shit about him to her about her dog which is bs. He didn't know about how what she was telling me about how she though he was judging her but I never told her he judged her, she was just assuming. 

She asks him to hang out with her over the weekend. He goes and holy shit. She blasts me saying I said such horrible shit about him. Completely overdramatizing everything. Saying I said he's psychotic and needs therapy and that she's got screenshots and recordings. She denies that she sent 46 messages to me as well. He gets convinced and reveals that he helped me and encouraged me to send that last message. She says I didn't really like her and her dog and that she scared me (which i did say, even though i knew she was harmless, she still does). She then goes into how she has her issues with him and he ends up crying because she's saying I said all these things about him and that I can't be trusted. It also comes out that I invited Alex over first and that he never asked to come over. After this he calls me and comes over to me. I show him all my text messages with her. He sees that she did send 46 messages but also the message where I say if he messes up I'll end the friendship without saying that I recognized my issues in the friendship too. He sees that I said nothing like Maya accused me of saying but he obviously does know what we talked about in person. Maya sends me two emails while he's there with me. They are insane, threatening legal action against me, full of lies or what she thought was the truth. He reads those as well.

The coming days after Alex texts me that he recognizes that I'm not someone that would say the things she was accusing me of, that it didn't make sense and that she's doesn't have screenshots and recordings or anything. He keeps trying to sort things out with Maya until he texts me he blocked her again.

Alex calls me tonight to say he cannot move forward in a friendship with me until I agree to a three-way phone call between all of us to sort this out. Me and Maya don't have to be friends but we have to try to come to some understanding. He also states that he's very hurt by both of us and that I basically started this whole thing by being dishonest and that i have a problem with honestyand accountability, which I agree. I sent her an email apologizing for not being honest, that she deserves a real friend, that I should've been able to say what i felt and not talk about her behind her back. I said I wanted to take accountability for my actions and the hurt I caused.

So...that's it. I'm realizing how toxic i can be by wanting to agree with everyone and not want to rock the boat. Or maybe that's not a good account of my actions? Idk. I was thinking maybe I should cut myself off from Alex as well because he never deserved any of this. 

What are people's thoughts?

22 y/o male, living in Tollygunge and currently studying CA. Honestly, I don’t have many friends around here, so I thought I’d step out of the usual study–sleep cycle and try to connect with people.

I’m looking for chill company—whether it’s grabbing coffee, exploring random food spots, long walks, or just talking about life, goals, or even silly late-night nonsense. Nothing intense, just good vibes and genuine conversations.

If you’re someone who enjoys hanging out casually, sharing memes, or discovering new corners of the city, feel free to drop a comment or DM. Worst case, we laugh over a few memes. Best case, we make a new friend.",1,1770106587.0,kolkata,0,1.0,False
1qumccr,https://mybook.to/1BBd7,"[Free] I’m a new author from India. My first book launch last week was a total ghost town (0 reviews), so I’m giving away my second book for free today hoping for a better 'handshake' with readers!","I'll be honest with you all—launching a book as an indie author is a lot lonelier than the movies make it look. I released my first anthology last week, and it basically disappeared into the void. No reviews, no downloads, just me and my keyboard.
I'm not ready to call it quits yet.
Today, I’m making the second book in my series, 'Beautiful Ways to Love', completely FREE. It’s a collection of 4 stories about the quiet, awkward, and beautiful ways we try to connect with each other.
The Stories:
""Crush"" & ""Coffee Date"": About the butterflies and the anxiety of the ""firsts.""
""Khamoshi"" & ""Chhaata"": About the beauty of things that remain unsaid.
If you enjoy atmospheric, emotional short fiction set in India, I’d love for you to grab a copy. Even though Book 1 isn't free anymore, Book 2 stands completely on its own.

Why I'm doing this: I don't have a marketing budget or a big following. I just want to know if my words resonate with anyone out there. If you do read it, a brief review on Amazon would mean the world—it’s the only way the algorithm starts to show the book to other people.
Note: If the link doesn't work in your country, just search for ""Beautiful Ways to Love"" by Rohit Singh Rathor on your local Amazon!",1,1770106470.0,FreeEBOOKS,1,1.0,False

I drink my coffee black (mostly V60) and lean towards fruity profiles, but I couldn't get a single distinct tasting note from any of these packs. The roast *looks* even, yet every cup came out bitter and flat.

I’ve tried everything to dial it in:

* **V60:** Ranged from 88-92°C down to 75°C. Experimented with my usual 1:15 ratio and even tried 1:12 at lower temps.
* **Aeropress:** 85°C at 1:13, hoping for a cleaner profile.
* **Moka Pot:** Used the Hoffmann technique in a 3-cup Bialetti out of pure desperation. Had to sink it immediately.

I don't think it's my technique since I’m getting excellent cups from other roasters. Even milk didn't save it.

First off it is A LOT more expensive (about $25 - 45 AUD per cup) but it is absolutely worth it, especially with the experience. 
They only brew geisha beans,  all from farms they own or have direct partnerships with, they treat you to a tea ceremony atmosphere and you are welcome to explore the garden and incredible heritage building.
They also brew using an automated machine I had never heard of, the Furumai.

This was by far the cleanest and most interesting coffees we had. My fiancee had hers iced and it was very tea like and with incredible flavour clarity. Tannins were even clearly identifiable for her. I had a hot black coffee, this was by far the best aroma (I've broken my nose a bunch so aroma is sometimes difficult but this was very present and gorgeous), incredibly clean cup and excellent clarity. 

Overall I recommend going for the experience of a centuries old geisha house, incredible garden and the addition of some amazing coffee.

1qum60a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qum60a,First time launching something publicly. Terrified and excited.,"I built a tool for content creators to manage their brand deals because I needed it myself. I was losing track of sponsorships in spreadsheets, missing payment deadlines, and leaving money on the table.

Even though right now I don't have a lot of sponsorships, I still thought this would be incredibly useful for creators who do. So I built exactly what I needed. Nothing fancy, just track deals, monitor payments, store contracts. No enterprise bloat that nobody uses.

The tech stack is simple: Next.js, Supabase, Stripe. Costs me about $40/month to run.

Here's what I realized: there are 200M+ creators out there, and most of them are still using spreadsheets to track their brand partnerships. Nobody's building tools specifically for them, just generic CRMs they'll never fully use.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

However, for those of us living in urban apartments or spending 40+ hours a week at a desk, that dream often feels out of reach.

Lately, I’ve been exploring the concept of ""Miniature Sanctuaries""—not as plastic office gimmicks, but as a legitimate extension of the *Hako-niwa* (box garden) tradition.

If you’re looking to bring a piece of Japanese garden philosophy to your workspace, here is how to approach it with intention.

# 1. The Philosophy of the ""Micro-Landscape""

A desktop garden shouldn't just be ""decoration."" It’s an exercise in *Ma* (negative space) and *Koko* (austere sublimity). Every grain of sand represents the sea; every stone represents a mountain or an island. When you approach it as a landscape rather than a toy, the meditative benefit changes completely.

# 2. Choosing Your Elements

* **The ""Sea"" (Sand):** Use high-quality, fine-grain sand (white quartz or crushed marble) to mimic the look of *Shirakawa* sand used in Kyoto temples. The texture determines how well your *Samon* (raked patterns) hold their shape.
* **The ""Islands"" (Stones):** Avoid perfectly polished ""river rocks"" from craft stores. Look for weathered, asymmetrical stones that embody *Wabi-sabi*. Place them according to the ""Rule of Three"" or in odd-numbered clusters to create natural tension.
* **The ""Bridge"" (The Rake):** A wooden rake is essential. The tactile feedback of wood on sand is part of the sensory experience that digital tools can't replicate.

# 3. The Practice of Samon

Raking the sand isn't just about ""fixing"" the garden. In Zen practice, the act of raking is a form of active meditation.

* **Concentric Circles:** Representing ripples around an island.
* **Straight Lines:** Representing the stillness of a calm sea.
* **The Mindset:** Try to rake in one continuous motion. Focus on the sound of the rake and the resistance of the sand. It’s a 2-minute reset for a cluttered mind.

# 4. Intentional Placement

Place your miniature garden where you can see it easily, but where it won't be cluttered by cables or coffee mugs. It needs its own ""sacred space"" on your desk to function as a true sanctuary.

**I’m curious to hear from the experts here:**

For those of you who have studied or built full-scale Japanese gardens, do you feel that these miniature versions can still capture the ""spirit"" of *Karesansui*?

Has anyone else used a desktop garden as a way to stay connected to these principles during a busy workday?",1,1770105657.0,JapaneseGardens,0,1.0,False

Like the title says ; im gonna message my (19m) ex gf (19) of 1.5 years tommorow evening. She broke up with me about 1.5 months ago. She was pretty hostile at first but whenever we have messaged recently she seemed quite nice. I plan on leading the conversation to a really low pressure coffee invitation. I really hope it goes well. We are eachothers first bf/gf and i wanna try again. Not aiming to talk about anything deep with her , just light topics to open up our line of communication again. 

The message i plan on sending is this:“Hey Liv, hope you’ve been doing well.Random question,  do you know any good coffee spots like black sheep coffee (this is a memory we share) nearby? I’ve been meaning to try some nicer ones.” 

If she responds well ill try give her an subtle invitation. 
If the message goes well ill request her on insta either after messaging or after meeting.

I’m based in Finland and exploring the idea of importing Indian coffee to launch a small specialty brand here. I’m still very early in the journey, and I’d love to learn from people who actually know the Indian coffee scene well.

I’m looking for recommendations for estates or roasters that are:

* Focused on quality over volume
* Not overly commercialised or mass‑market
* Known for distinctive flavour profiles, careful processing, and transparent sourcing
* Ideally open to working with small importers or doing direct trade

I’m especially interested in lesser‑known gems, places that put real craft into what they do but aren’t necessarily the big names everyone already knows.

If you have personal favourites, estates you trust, or roasters doing exceptional work with Indian beans, I’d really appreciate your insights. Any tips on regions, varieties, or producers worth exploring would also be super helpful.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to share their knowledge. I’m excited to dive deeper into the world of Indian coffee.",1,1770105426.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

I have 2 beautiful children my son (21M) & a daughter (6F). I’m married to a wonderful guy (43M) we have been together for 6 1/2 years. A little backstory, 7 years ago I was living in San Diego California taking care of my Grandmother who had Alzheimer’s and has since past. I was a mess fighting my addiction and online dating a lot. I met a nice man (44M)who I dated a few months before I found out I was pregnant. We were both surprised as neither one of us were supposed to have anymore kids. When I took the test and it came back positive he freaked out & had left me. A few days before I had met my boyfriend I had gone home to the desert to visit and ran into an old acquaintance(48M) and slept with him. It was a one time Wham Bam, I went home and not thought anything of it. My assumption when I found out I was pregnant was it was my boyfriend’s cause we had been together for a couple months and I’d not been with anyone else. Anyways I went back to visit back home the following week and was talking to the acquaintance that I had slept with. I told him I was pregnant and my boyfriend’s cause had dumped me. He was unable to have children, him and his ex wife had tried for years with no luck and due to a childhood injury was told he wouldn’t be able to have any. He did say if I wanted he would be willing to help me out while I was pregnant and wanted to be a part of if my boyfriend was not stepping up. I was alone again as I was pregnant with my son and said sure he could help out and be a part of. 
He had told me on several occasions he was coming to meet me and never showed so I just figured he had changed his mind, which I was fine with and I just kept on truckin by myself. I’d done it once I’ll do it again. So at this time the baby was close to arriving and my ex boyfriend had contacted me and had had a change of heart and now wanted to be involved. He wasn’t able to make it for the delivery cause I had moved back to the desert and he wasn’t able still in San Diego which was a 3 hr drive and she came fast. He bought everything for her, came with family to meet her and we were in contact daily. One day he called and said he wanted a DNA test cause his Doctor had explained that it was not possible for him to have gotten my pregnant. I said fine let’s do this. We ordered a test from Amazon sent it in and waited.
The results came back I could hear Maury,”You are NOT the father!” We were both devastated by the results. I was left confused and he was heartbroken. Even though he didn’t care he still wanted to raise her with me. Long story short the child support worker told him he was dumb to take on the financial responsibility for a child that wasn’t his and he changed his mind and we only spoke one more time before we cut off all contact. 
I had to think who was I with before him and it came to me, the acquaintance. I’ll try to make this part brief cause it’s a long story already but I reached out to him and told him he needed to take the test. He argued with me, told me it wasn’t possible and alluded to the fact I hadn’t exactly been a saint. He wasn’t able forced to take the test eventually and sure as hell she was his. I had seen him several times before he took the test as we had mutual friends who hosted coffee every Sunday morning. When he say her the 1st time he said “Oh Sh*t!”.  During those Sunday mornings he had his then gf with him and in attempts to make her feel secure he would speak horribly about me by dragging my name through the mud, calling me a hoe and insisting my daughter isn’t his. I met my husband when my daughter was 5 months old and he has raised her as his own, she doesn’t know he isn’t her real dad. 
Fast forward to 3 years ago. My mother asked if I’d have a problem with her reaching out to him to ask about the family’s medical history to see if there is anything we should be aware of. I agreed thinking 1 phone call wouldn’t be a big deal and. I sure didn’t wanna talk to him. The acquaintance. Had fought his own battle with dr*gs and won and when he had 2 years, he has 4 now, he reached out to me about wanting to be a part of my daughter’s life. I spoke to my husband and agreed to send him pics, give updates under 1 condition, he went through my husband. It was a respect thing and like I said had no interest I. Speaking to him myself. After a few calls he disregarded everything we had agreed upon and contacted me. He didn’t ask about my child but he wanted to know what I’d been up to. I cut off communication and have not spoken to him till the other night. My mother has always been in my corner in regards to this whole issue or so I thought. Unbeknownst to me she had maintained contact with him this entire time and finally met him in person a few months ago. He left the program where he was working as a cook and moved to Mexico with my mother. They are in a relationship and her and I’s relationship has completely deteriorated. We had fought so hard to build a good relationship over the last year before he got out and now we can barely speak without arguing. She sees nothing wrong with the fact she is dating him even though he impregnated me. I’ve tried to explain how she crossed a boundary that should never be crossed. She says they don’t sleep together and tried to deny the relationship completely until I came at her with receipts proving I knew what was going on. She is constantly telling me how sorry he is for everything he said. Constantly telling me how I need to tell my daughter about him which I plan on doing but not till she’s a bit older. I can barely wrap my head around this hillbilly BS and I’m an adult. She is 6 and I’m supposed to explain how my step daddy is her daddy too? I don’t think so. She claims I try to punish them by using my daughter for leverage, but I’m not sure what she thinks I’m trying to leverage. I forgot to mention me my husband, my daughter and step daughter live in the house owned by my mother. We have lived her 5 years, paid the mortgage and all the bills and when she visits from her house in Mexico she stays in a trailer on the property. When she told me she would be back for summer like she always is I made it clear he wasn’t welcome and there would be a big problem if she brings him. My mother told me my daughter is gonna be mad for lying to her and I needed to tell her sooner rather than later. When I explained I will NOT be telling her anytime soon and I’m leaving it to the court to decide if this man who dates her and has paid $0 child support can see his child can have visitation, she told me he will be coming with her in June and I have 6 months to “figure it out”. I feel she’s trying to back me into a corner and it’s not about punishing anyone. It’s about my child’s mental health and her being able to process not just having another dad but that her dad is also her grandpa. So we went and found a house the next day and we will be moving in 2 days. I’ve never made this about the child support as I know I’m never gonna get a dime from him cause he doesn’t work and probably will never. I need to know AITAH for not wanting to tell my daughter right now and for being upset about my mother dating my baby daddy?",3,1770105238.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

1qulx4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1qulx4z/leaving_my_friend_group_because_of_drama/,Leaving my friend group because of drama,"As the title states, I left my friend group that I’ve known since middle-high school (over 7 1/2 years) due to petty drama from another couple in the group. To start this off I met my current girlfriend a year and half ago that was new to the group but was known and hanged out with half of the people. The group would usually play online and maybe 1 or 2 times a month hangout and drink or go somewhere but, online gaming was the primary way we all hanged out. 

The other couple in the group who I will refer to as M and F (male and female) had invited us to get coffee together and tell us that they were getting married soon. I was obviously excited to see the my best friend get married and was asked to be the groomsmen and my gf to be Fs bridesmaid. Didn’t think of it too much at the time till later because F had only met my gf that same day and never had once spoken to her without the group being together. I shrugged it off and thought nothing of it until a month later where my gf was being overwhelmed by Fs text of her potential wedding being cancelled due to M and F being unstable and feeling like shes not being heard. To give context I knew M since Middle school and thought of him as one of my life-long friend and have only met F about 4 years from now. F is heavily bipolar and has in more then one occasion bursted out on M both publicly and within the group. I’ve learned when F was stable enough to be around and when she isn’t for example: if she were able to joke with or make jokes about current topics. My gf didn’t know  how to talk to F without hurting her feelings so she tried just comforting her and letting her know that he “does love her” and “hope that they can get through these hard times together” and such. After this mess F had completely ghosted my gf and hasn’t talked or texted her unless again we were in a group which made me feel even more uneasy seeing that their might be tension between the two. The bridesmaids and F spent a day to pick our their dresses for the wedding in a local store my gf had told me that she picked out this beautiful maroon dress and was ready to pay for it until Fs mom had gathered all the bridesmaids dresses and purchased them herself claiming it to be a “gift” and show support to the girls that F had pick to be her bridesmaids (this will be referred too again). 

My girlfriend and I were planning to finally have a place of our own and move closer to our group so we can hangout more frequent, closer to work, and it was a affordable apartment that we both liked. 2 of them have sent mutiple posts about how dangerous and unmodern the area is. Note these 2 friends (I will use R and D to refer them) are both transgender and one of them is very political. Me and gf have both stated that we want to move their not because of the environment but because it was very convenient and the amount of negativity being sent towards us was unappreciated. After a couple of weeks F birthday came up and me and my gf was invited to go, at the time I was at work 4am and was stuck there till 7:30pm. In between that time I managed to convince my gf to go because I had said it will show F that you do appreciate her inviting her to Fs bday. Only M, one friend that I will refer to as B, my gf, and R showed up to the party. None of the other bridesmaids or groomsmen had came and I only showed up 10 mins after my shift was over. This had very much dwelled on me because I had only seen one of the other 5 bridesmaid come to gatherings in the group (she will be C). 

Later F and my gf had an outing due to my gf making a joke while she was drunk and said outloud about how F freaked out on M in public all the time which had offended F. My gf had apologized to F but had heard nothing for almost 2 days to where F has completely burned the bridge to my gf and had kicked her out of the bridesmaid chat and wedding. This had made it very akward in my position because now Im being told by M and F that they want nothing to do with my gf. Tension was being made in the group as well and it felt like there was a complete divide because of the situation that had unfolded. A solution that I made was a guys night just me and the OGs to talk to eachother and remember why we all became friends and try to have a good time with this. Unfortunately M didnt go due to F feeling she is being left out after as I quote “all she did to have the group come together and I was treating her unfairly” which enraged me because the entire point of this event wasn’t about the drama but the love of the group. 

2 months later around 10:30pm while I was working overnight my gf recieved a text from C that Fs mother wants her to return the dress that she had gifted my gf and to do so immediately because they had replaced my gf with Ms cousin. My gf refused to give her the dress because she had picked it out herself and shes not obligated to return a gift. Wanting to end this petty drama I texted C about the cost of the dress and to not tell F about the situation due to F having recently been in a collision with a deer and has been in consistent pain and stress. C told me how he hated how I was being forced into this and that she couldn’t hide this from F and she wouldn’t be a good friend if she did. Hell had unleashed upon my phone about this damn dress. From what F has told me was that my gf was disrespectful to her and M both irl and text, C being disrespected by my gf about the dress, and how she expects my gf to give the dress back after being kicked out of the wedding. I tried to calm her down claiming that I can’t force my gf to just give the dress back nor can I take it away from her and hand it over. The text that really made me upset was how F had mentioned that “shes glad that she never ripped M away from his friends and that shes sorry she can’t deal with the drama my gf had brought up”, this text had a deeper meaning because F had talked about how M was never able to talk to his friends or even look at other girls until F showed up in his life and “changed” him. The next day she threatened to call the police to my house for theft if my gf did not bring back the dress, I told F bluntly that there is no reason to escalate this if she just allow me to pay the dress like I’ve had said before. F accepeted the money and told me to never message her again until I have grown a “backbone”.

The group obviously had been divided and because of the drama and I have assumed that I was also kicked out of the wedding. Last Dec. I tried to plan a hangout with my friends and only received one text from R that he had family issues so I told him we can postpone it next month and he agreed. January came around and I asked about which days were good and have had zero replies to, I saw my friends in a discord call and decided to hop in and play a couple games with them. We had a good time until I heard word of how they were talking about the party at M and Fs house last weekend and it completely broke me down to the point I couldn’t stay in the call. R had texted me if I was oky and I had mentioned that I didn’t feel great that I was basically being kept out of the loop because of what happened with M and F. R had kicked my gf from our discord server and had said that he seen things unfold and he cares about me and if I left the server he would understand. I told him I needed time for myself and about a week after I texted him about going to a bar and was recieved with “I dont think its a good time for either of us rn”. R has now completely stop communicating with me almost a month and having feeling that I’m left with only 1 option I left the group chat and had only kept in touch with those that I knew I can trust. The whole month of January felt like a rollercoaster of sadness in my head thinking that their judging me without even giving my side of the story or even a chance to protect myself. Now out of the entire group I text one person that I believe I can only trust now and have been trying to keep moving forward away from this drama. ",1,1770104904.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

1qulrtu,https://youtube.com/shorts/RxqRM4iIktw,Volume Discounts Increased Our Repeat Purchase Rate by 47% - Here's The Setup,"Hey r/shopify!

Davis here, founder of Libautech. Want to share a pricing strategy that's been crushing it for our merchants.

**The Strategy: Volume Discounts with Visual Switching**

Instead of just showing one price, let customers SEE the savings:

* Buy 1: Save 15%
* Buy 3+: Save 33%

**Why It Works:**

1. **Anchoring effect** \- When customers see ""33% off for 3 items"" vs ""15% for 1"", buying more feels like leaving money on the table
2. **Immediate visual comparison** \- No mental math required
3. **Bulk buying psychology** \- ""I'll need more eventually anyway""

**Real Results from Our Merchants:**

* Supplement brand: Average order jumped from 1.2 units → 2.8 units
* Skincare store: 47% increase in customers buying 3+ items
* Pet supplies: AOV increased 52% (buy 3 bags of treats vs. 1)

**Pro Tips:**

* Add countdown timer for urgency (""Sale ends in 24h"")
* Include trust badges near the switcher
* Best discount tiers: 10-15% / 25-35% / 40-50%
* Works best for consumables, supplements, socks, underwear, coffee, etc.

**The Key:** Make the switcher interactive. Let customers toggle between quantities and SEE the savings difference in real-time.

I made a quick video showing exactly how to set this up (check my profile or search ""**Libautech Bundles and Upsell**"" in the app store)

**Question:** Anyone here testing volume/quantity discounts? What tiers are working for you?

* **Don't have a laptop?**: I included a **basic native computing env** right in the app. It's not a supercomputer, but it can run lightweight tasks (like the AI agent logic) directly on your phone, so you can still get work done even without a host machine.
* **Offline First**: Relay represents a ""State"". It is built to work offline. You can read code, edit files, and use installed **Apps** without an internet connection (unless the specific feature obviously requires it, like fetching external data). Sync happens automatically when you're back online.

# The ""Killer Feature"": Rcode Agent (Like Claude Code for VS Code)

I really liked the agentic workflow in tools like [Claude Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code) for VS Code, so I built something similar directly into this since *Rcode* *doesn't support VS Code extensions yet.*  
  
**Meta-Story:** This specific feature—the extension Claude-like agent—was actually built **using Claude Code.** I used the agent to help me architect its own functions and tools.

[Lazy Demo](https://preview.redd.it/w61bncfgc8hg1.png?width=2098&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ca41e2c82c2f60a656f1a1f4d45bcea7f32a9b)

It's an autonomous agent that lives in your editor. You can point it at a file and say ""fix the types"" or ""refactor this,"" and because it's running on your main machine (or natively!), it has full access to your file system and terminal. It actually understands your project structure, But always you can use Claude Code directly.

# Build Your Own Apps (No App Store Required)

Relay isn't just an editor; it's a runtime. You can build your own ""Apps"" using our SDK.

* **Community Store**: It's a Git-based store. To publish an app, you just submit a PR to our store repository. Once merged, it's available to everyone instantly.
* **Full Access**: Your apps allow you to build internal tools, dashboards, or custom interfaces that interact with your server.

# Why I made this

I often found myself staring at my screen while an AI agent did the work. Sitting there with a hot laptop on my lap just to watch a progress bar felt like a waste of time.

I built Relay so I could:

1. **Start a task** on my powerful machine (e.g., ""Implement this feature"").
2. **Walk away**. Put the laptop down.
3. **Monitor & Intervene** from my phone if I need to answer a question or fix a small error.

It's about freedom. I wanted to use Claude Code and my own dev environment, but untether myself from the desk.

It's mostly open source (core components) and free to use. People can even build their own applications on top of the Relay runtime.

**Global Ready** The platform is fully localized in **English** and **Mandarin (中文)**.

1qulmzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/VillainyGroup/comments/1qulmzq/the_villainy_of_instant_coffee/,The Villainy of Instant Coffee,">I'm going to potentially surprise you now. Instant coffee was invented in New Zealand, in the city of Invercargill. Not Colombia, not the UK, France, and certainly not USA.

* Now, there are some claims that a chap called John Dring invented instant coffee in 1771, but this was a paste of 'coffee essence', and not instant coffee in the sense we understand it today.

[Coffee](https://preview.redd.it/9scu3dhkf8hg1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f29439ecf57920f974b77b112b16ca28c3985e4)

Coffee itself was, at the time, usually drunk with beans roasted hard, boiled directly in the water, and drunk with the grounds still in it. ""Gritty"" wouldn't begin to cover it.

Consistency was rare and freshness was unbelievably fragile, especially at the far end of global shipping routes - which frequently started in far-off places with names like 'Yemen"" and ""Java"", and ""The Caribbean"".

**So, along wombles David Strang, a merchant and a coffee fan, living in Invercargill, New Zealand.**

This was not an obvious place for this type of innovation. It was a small colonial town better known for sheep and weather than chemistry. I mean, it still is... but at least now they have internet.

Realistically, Strang wasn't chasing high-class refinement of an increasingly popular product. He was trying to solve practical problems. Coffee beans spoiled fairly quickly... and the whole process of turning a bean into Don'tTalkToMeUntilI'veDrunkAllThis Juice was complicated and irritating.

Colonial life rewarded anything that could be preserved, dried, and stuck in an earthenware jar for a long time without getting ergot all over it.

So, in 1890, he patented what he called the “Dry Hot-Air process.”

The coffee was first brewed in the normal way. The liquid extract was then exposed to heated air until the water had completely evaporated, leaving behind a solid residue. This was crumbled up into powder, and sealed away for freshness.

All you had to do later was add hot water, and Hey Presto!

Instant Will To Live.

This made it completely soluble as well, which meant that you tended to avoid a lot of the grit that coffee was so well-known for.

>It should be noted that there are several other folk almost contemporary to Strang who are credited for instant coffee too. The first is Satori Kato in 1901, and the other is George Constant Louis Washington in 1909. Both were long after Strang.

Strang's product, sold as Strang’s Coffee, but remained local. There was very-much a trick missed, and no global distribution.

His process worked, and worked exceptionally well, but scaling it up to global levels would have required capital and machinery that just wasn't available at the bottom of the world.

At least, not to anyone outside the extremely lucrative whaling, seal-skin, gold, and sheep markets.

Strang remained a businessman rather than a celebrity inventor. He continued trading in coffee and spices but never really became internationally known.

By the time instant coffee became a global product, his name had already largely faded.

He died at the age of 71 in 1917 - comfortably well-off, but not extremely wealthy, having invented something wonderful, but perhaps not really understanding the possibilities.

1quljp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA3/comments/1quljp3/my_oc/,My OC,"• Full Name: Megan Hawthorn
• Nicknames/Aliases: ""The Fox,"" ""My White Fox"" (by Asuka Kasen), ""Everyone's Irish Whore"" (by his detractors), ""Irish-Coward"" (used ironically by himself, and contemptuously by his enemies).

• Age: 35 (in 2001, during the events of GTA III).

• Place of Birth: Los Santos, San Andreas (grew up in the Temple Drive neighborhood, on the border of Grove Street and Ballas territories).

• Current Residence: A discreet but luxurious apartment in the Bedford Point neighborhood, Staunton Island, Liberty City. The apartment faces a wall, a deliberate choice to avoid firing lines.

• Occupation: Criminal defense attorney, admitted to the San Andreas and Liberty City bars. Specializes in defending high-profile criminals.

• Favorite Radio Station: Rise FM. Electronic and ambient music helps him calm his anxieties and concentrate. He also sometimes listens to Chatterbox to hear Lazlow's ramblings and get a feel for the city's atmosphere.

II. Physical Appearance
Megan is a 35-year-old man who looks 40, his features marked by stress and sleepless nights.

• Physical Appearance: Slim, slender, almost gangly. He often has a hunched posture, as if to make himself appear smaller. He is not physically imposing, but his eyes are piercing.

• Hair: A mop of unruly red hair, starting to gray at the temples. Badly cut, it looks as if he cut his own hair in a moment of paranoia.

• Face: Pale, covered in freckles. A sharp, blue-green gaze that quickly shifts from confusion to intense lucidity. Pronounced dark circles under his eyes. Almost always sports a stubble.

• Clothing Style:

• For work: A wrinkled but good-quality three-piece suit (often dark: black, charcoal, navy blue). White or blue shirt, often stained with coffee. Loosely tied tie.

When traveling: Long, worn coat, fedora to hide from surveillance cameras (real or imagined). He alternates between discreet civilian clothes and more ""hip"" Staunton Island outfits when he has to see Asuka. 

Anxiety: He is extremely anxious because he believes that any gang (except the Yakuza) could come and kill him in one fell swoop.

Chronic Confusion: He often struggles to keep track of the threads of his many schemes. He mixes up files, contact names, and deliveries. This apparent ""incompetence"" makes him underestimated, which has saved his life on several occasions. He often mutters to himself, trying to bring order to his thoughts and maintain a stable, reliable presence in his chaotic world.

Survival: Deep down, Megan is a survivor. All his flaws, his paranoia, his lies, are aimed at staying alive for one more day in a game where there are too many players.

IV. History and Connections

Origins (San Andreas): Born in a tough neighborhood, he witnessed his brother's death in a gang war. He studied law to make a clean break, but the easy money of defending small-time gangsters in Los Santos lured him in. It was there, in the 1990s, that he crossed paths with a young Carl ""CJ"" Johnson, providing him with minor legal advice. He also worked indirectly for Mike (GTA Advance), a contact who taught him the value of an informant network. 
• Arrival in Liberty City: Sent by his firm to open a branch in Liberty, he was quickly approached by the Mafia families. The Leones, the Sindaccos, and the Forellis are all clients at one time or another. He juggles them, making sure never to be exclusive.

• The Decisive Alliance - The Yakuza: When Asuka Kasen needed an ""outside"" lawyer for a delicate case, Megan shone. His apparent weakness and absolute loyalty, once bought, charmed Asuka. He became their personal legal advisor and their spy within the judicial system and among the other families.

• The Widespread Network:

• Yardies: He respects them, finds them predictable. A business relationship.

• Donald Love: Considers him an unpredictable psychopath, but an extremely wealthy client. Megan is afraid of him.

• Diablos & Colombian Cartel: Tense, purely transactional relationship. They despise him, he is afraid of them.

• The Police: He has a few corrupt detectives on his payroll, but fears Chief McCaffery above all else. He must conceal the extent of his activities or risk losing his immunity.

V. Role in GTA III (Detailed Story)
Megan is not a main character, but a pivotal figure in the narrative, operating behind the scenes.


• First appearance (Mission for Asuka): Asuka introduces Megan to Claude and asks him to eliminate triads who know too much about him. He gives Claude several missions (5 in total). He calls Claude ""Silent Kid.""

• The ""Death"" (Mission for Darkel): Darkel, the deranged environmentalist, hires Claude to ""clean up"" the city of its parasites. One of his targets is Megan ""The Fox,"" perceived as a crooked lawyer corrupting the city. The ""Irish Coffee"" mission involves chasing Megan's car (a distinctive white Stallion) through Portland and then eliminating her in her parking lot. Claude fires, the car explodes, and Megan is left for dead.

• The Survival: In reality, Megan had anticipated an assassination attempt (a saving grace of paranoia). He was driving an inconspicuous armored vehicle. The man in the Stallion was a decoy. He was nevertheless seriously injured by the explosion and steel fragments, and fell into a coma at the Portland hospital. 

• The Return (Mission for Asuka): A few weeks later, Asuka, torn between her distrust of Claude and her desire for revenge against the Colombian Cartel, learns that Megan is alive. She hires Claude to get her out of the hospital (mission ""Fox Hunt""). Megan, weak and distrustful of Claude (whom she recognizes as her attacker), is taken back to the relative safety of the Yakuza mansion. 
• Betrayal and Death: Asuka plans a final assault against the Cartel. Megan, consumed by guilt for having survived and the fear of losing Asuka, discovers that she intends to send Claude alone on a suicide mission. Driven by anxiety and confused emotions, he goes to the Portland docks where the exchange/confrontation is to take place (mission ""The Exchange"" or a similar name). 
· Final Scene: He arrives on the scene just as Claude, the Yakuza, and the Cartel are fighting. Enraged, shouting for them to stop, he rushes into the firing zone, trying to explain himself, to  He warned Asuka of a danger he had imagined or that was real. Confusion reigned. He suddenly collapsed, before a bullet could even hit him. Under extreme stress, fear, and the lingering effects of his injuries, he suffered a sudden cardiac arrest. The fight continued for a moment around his indifferent body. Asuka screamed his name one last time before having to focus on the battle. His death was as absurd and sudden as the life he had led: an accident amidst the chaos he had helped to create. 

VI. Vehicle & Weapons

• Primary Vehicle: A drab, gray Kuruma, modified with light armor and a powerful engine for getting away. Sometimes a Sentinel for his ""upscale"" dates.

• Preferred Weapon: He never carries a heavy weapon. At most, a 9mm pistol he barely knows how to use, tucked into an ankle holster. His real weapons are his phone and his address book.

VII. Dialogue & Typical Quotes 

· (Talking to himself in his car) ""No, the time for the meeting with the Sindaccos was 3 p.m., right? Or 4 p.m.? And the Colombians, did they know? They always know everything..."" 
· (Speaking to himself about Asuka) ""She used 'Mywhite fox' again. It's... it's just a metaphor, Megan. Don't be stupid."" 

(Last words, stammering, on the docks) ""Asuka! Stop! I... I knew... the contract... my heart... Holy shit, I'm dying--

1qulihh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessIntelligence/comments/1qulihh/anyone_else_seeing_fewer_dashboard_requests_this/,Anyone else seeing fewer dashboard requests this year?,"Been doing BI consulting for about 10 years, mostly for small and medium businesses. Built hundreds of dashboards in Tableau and Power BI over that time.

But this year something changed. Dashboard requests dropped noticeably.

Wanted to share what I'm seeing and hear if others are experiencing the same.

**What's happening with my clients**

My bigger clients still want dashboards for deep-dive analysis. But most of my SMB clients? They just want the key numbers. They don't want to log into a portal, find the right tab, filter five times just to see if sales are up.

They're asking for simpler solutions.

**What I'm building instead**

Three things have taken over most of my work:

**1. Chatbots on top of their data**

Clients want to ask questions in plain English and get answers. The tricky part isn't the AI — it's building a solid semantic model underneath so the answers are actually accurate.

**2. KPIs pushed to Slack/Teams/WhatsApp**

Leadership doesn't want another login. They want key numbers delivered before their morning coffee. I'm building agents that pull from databases and push metrics directly to their existing channels.

**3. Automated reports via email**

Some clients still want a daily PDF or PPT summary in their inbox. Instead of building this manually, I'm using automation tools to pull data, generate the report, and send it out.

**Why I think this is happening**

Beyond the AI hype, SMBs are looking to cut costs. Connecting data sources and maintaining dashboards gets expensive. They want something simpler that fits their actual workflow.

**One example**

A small manufacturing client wanted a Power BI dashboard connecting Xero and Zoho. When we priced out the connectors, it blew their budget.

We stepped back. They didn't need a full dashboard, they needed daily visibility on a few numbers.

Built an automation that hits both APIs and sends their KPIs to Teams every morning. Hosting cost is minimal. They're happy because it fits how they actually work.

**The shift**

It feels like insights are moving from ""pull"" (log in, find the report) to ""push"" (data comes to you).

Curious what others are seeing. Is dashboard work slowing down for you too? What tools are you using for these self-service use cases?",6,1770103424.0,BusinessIntelligence,3,0.69,False

This Ben and my mom became business partners, nagkaroon sila ng pet supplies na nalugi and now coffee shop. naging involve kami ng younger brother ko sa coffee shop nila because mahilig kami ng brother ko sa coffee and marunong kami gumawa ng espresso based coffees. since madalas kami pumupunta sa coffee shop nila mas marami na ako napapansin sa kanila ng mom ko na napapansin na din ng bro ko but we are not talking about it at the time. 

my mom was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer so need nya mag chemo and radiation and this Ben iba ang commitment sa paghahatid sundo sa mom ko. and everytime may chemo ang mom ko hindi sya uuwi that night, ang paalam lang nya saamin ay mag oovernight sya sa best friend nya na babae. i always think it's BS but hinahayaan ko lang. aside from this since dumating itong Ben sa buhay ng nanay ko napapansin namin ng bro ko na sobrang daming niluluto na ulam ng nanay namin than usual. routine nya ay aalis tuwing hapon and magdadala ng half ng ulam.  kapag tinatanong sya sinasabi nya lang na dadalhan nya yung friend nya na babae or dadalhan nya mga tauhan nya sa store. i didn't believe her every single time. somehow may kutob ako na para yun dun kay Ben. may mga times din na nag-aaway sila ni Ben(business matter daw) and everytime na magkaaway sila hindi rin umaalis ng bahay ang nanay namin but once na magkabati sila babalik sya sa usual routine.

Nagkaroon ng gf ang brother ko at first pinapagalitan sya ng mom ko and step dad because hindi sya nagpapaalam and ginagabi always ng uwi. my brother tried solving the issue. ginawa nya yung gusto ng parents na magpaalam and proper na introduction ng gf nya sa amin. we thought tapos na yung issue but our mom ayaw na ayaw talaga nya sa gf ng kapatid ko grabe yung pag trashtalk nya na sinasabihan nyang ""p\*k p\*k"" daw because Nakita nya may pics sa ig na nagpaparty(gen z things) umabot sa point na she talks trash sa kapatid ko it is basically bullying(she also did this to me nung time na bago kami ng gf ko).

While nangyayari ang issue nila ng brother ko may isang instance na driving ako galing sa gym and nakita ng gf ko yung pickup namin na lumalabas sa kabilang village.

kinutuban na ako pero nag wait ako makauwi to ask my mom. pagpasok ko ng Bahay una ko nakita ang brother ko and i told him immediately na ""Nakita ko yung pickup natin lumalabas sa kabilang village ah"" then my mom na nandoon pala sa kusina heard what i said. bigla syang pumunta sa amin and nag explain and i noticed na sobrang dami nyang sinasabi and kwento kesyo nag rerescue daw ng cats(pet rescuer kasi sya sabi nya) and yung si Ben yung may dala ng pickup. super obvious na parang kinabahan sya and natataranta sa pag explain, sobrang haba na ng kwento nya umabot na sa point na may binabanggit na sya na mga tao na hindi ko kilala na mga taga animal shelter daw. as usual hinayaan ko nalang sya and i let it go.

a few weeks later naka sched pumunta sa Cebu ang step dad namin(business trip) and i decided na if umalis ng bahay ang mom namin pupunta ako sa kabilang village to check. sinabi ko to sa gf ko and she offered na gamitin ang car nya para hindi kami makilala if ever. btw i decided na gawin ito because before this cebu thing ng step dad ko may business trip sya na davao and sa span ng trip ng step dad ko, araw araw nag oovernight ang mom ko sa ""friend"" daw nya. uuwi lang sya ng umaga para magluto then aalis na ulit. naging idea ko na baka nasa kabilang village lang sya nag oovernight since hindi nababawasan ang gas ng car na pinang oovernight nya(yes i always check her gas consumption) and sobrang bilis nya makauwi may times na pag chinat ko sya asking something sasagot lang sya na uuwi sya and less than 4mins nasa bahay na.

the first night na nasa cebu ang step dad ko umalis na agad ang mom namin. so kinakabahan nako kasi i will check na sa kabilang village, i told my gf na itutuloy ko na but she said i-wait ko sya kasi pauwi na sya from office. sinundo ko ang gf ko sa kanto and we waited sa house namin until 11pm. so nag drive na kami papuntang kabilang village tuloy tuloy lang ang pagpasok namin since walang guard. and we scanned every streets and mga houses until may isang street na naka park ang motor ni Ben. then a few blocks away sa motor nakita ko yung hyundai santa fe namin na naka park sa loob ng gate ng isang house. i took pictures and videos and grabe yung kaba and disappointment na na-fefeel ko. kasi before pa sya umalis that day nag confirm sya sa tito namin(kuya ng mom ko) na pupunta daw sya sa friend nya and sinabi nya yung place and yung place na sinabi nya malayo kung nasaan sya that night. pagkauwi ko i talked to my brother sa nadiscover ko and bigla din sya nag kwento ng mga napapansin nya na weird and kutob nya. 

the next day umuwi ang mom namin ng morning and but i held back. i kept to myself kung ano yung nalalaman ko. that night umalis ulit sya to overnight but ibang kotse naman ang dinala and the same night chineck ko ulit sya and nandoon ulit sya. i decided not to confront her because honestly hindi ko na alam ano dapat gawin regarding this matter, i am confused, angry and disappointed. until a week ago na-late ng uwi sa bahay ang brother ko. and pagkauwi nya kasama nya ang gf nya nagpaalam sya sa step dad ko na pupunta daw sila sa coffee shop ng friend namin. etong mom ko pinuntahan ako sa room ko galit na galit sa brother ko kesyo inuwi daw yung ""p\*k p\*k"" na gf then umalis pa gabi na etc etc. hindi ko sya gaano pinansin i just slept after. then after that day umalis mama ko kasama si Ben, pumunta sila tagaytay nagpasama daw sya kasi may need sya bayaran regarding sa lupa namin sa tagaytay. pagkauwi nya kumain pa kami including my brother and my tito(kuya ng mama ko) na dumating din. everything is good until bigla nya pinagalitan kapatid ko regarding doon sa gf nya and yung gabi umalis. at first reasonable pa until napikon sya dahil nag rereason out kapatid ko she said ""sumasagot"" daw then bigla na nya ako dinamay minura nya kapatid ko and minura nya ako sabay sinabing ayaw daw nya sa mga gf namin.

I admit i bursted out. nauwi sa kami na ang nagsasagutan at sigawan. hindi ko na napigilan kasi ang galing nya mangaral and magsalita pero sya yung may katarantaduhan na ginagawa. inaawat na kami ng mga stay-out help namin and yung tito ko pati yung step dad ko naki awat na until nasabi ko yung about kay Ben loudly.Lahat ay biglang tumahimik. Kitang-kita sa mukha niya na nagulat siya. Hindi siya nagsalita, umalis lang siya sa gitna ng usapan at kinuha ang isa sa mga sasakyan namin. nag chat sya sakin a few hours later na dinisrespect ko daw sya and lumayas na daw ako. nagsagutan pa kami sa chat nang mahaba pero kahit once hindi nya binanggit yung kay Ben.

a few days later nagkita kami sa bahay and sinabihan nya ako na mag-usap daw kami minention na nya yung kay Ben nakagawa na sya ng reason ang sabi nya iniwan lang daw nya car doon kay Ben tsaka sya susunduin ng friend nyang girl in which is a lot of BS. first bakit mo need iwanan ang kotse doon sa kabilang village? bakit hindi ka magpasundo sa tapat ng bahay natin? umabot yung argument na sinabi na nya na nahuli ko daw ba sya nakikipag sex and this part i admit na may fault ako because i raised my voice nang malala nauwi kami sa mas matinding sigawan and murahan. she finally said na lumayas ako bakit daw nasa bahay pa ako in which i agreed and umalis na ako doon. 

last monday i apologized sa mga nasabi ko sa kanya but i still stand my ground regarding kay Ben. sinabi ko sa kanya na walang naniniwala sa kanya and hindi nya narin minention ulit yung matter regarding sa jowa nya. ang reply lang nya ay puro about sa pag disrespect sa kanya. my step dad as usual believed her lies and kampi lang sa mom ko. i don't know what will happen now i am very emotional this past few days.

My mom is a serial cheater her history of cheating is insane and i thought nagbago na sya pero hindi pa pala and that is my biggest disappointment.

and to add yung step dad ko and my dad ay may overlapping and not just them meron pa na dalawang lalake na involve, lahat sila ay nag overlap.",13,1770103292.0,RantAndVentPH,8,1.0,False

It was a children's book rented from a library in Sierra Vista, AZ, sometime back in 2013-2015. It was written like an adventurer's guide (except we followed along as the author detailed his journey). The author wrote as though you were along with him, he'd explain the dangers either as he encountered them or to explain why he avoided certain parts of the world. It's most similar to Secrets of Deltora and Dragonology. The pages were printed to mimic old paper, and they were covered in various stains (coffee, purple blood of a creature). There were detailed colorful illustrations.

Key events I remember are him visiting several cities, one of which he has to pay guards luxurious goods in order to cross the bridge to get to a luxurious city. There are several monsters detailed through the book; he describes avoiding a forest because of a monster that tickles people to death (it looked akin to a thin yeti), and monsters that look like plants but are holes in the ground, dissolving their prey to death. He hangs his boots up when he sets up camp for a night; I believe some type of scorpion monster was crawling and he squashed it with the journal (hence the purple blood).

1qulfc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qulfc5/the_sciencebased_guide_to_actually_changing_your/,The Science-Based Guide to Actually Changing Your Life with Deep Work in 6 Months,"Ok so i've spent the last year studying peak performance, reading Cal Newport, watching MIT
lectures, listening to Huberman's podcast, going down rabbit holes about flow states and
neuroplasticity.
and honestly? most people approaching ""deep work"" are doing it completely wrong. they're
treating it like some productivity hack when it's actually a complete lifestyle restructure.
the problem isn't lack of discipline. it's that our brains are literally rewired for distraction now.
research from Microsoft shows the average attention span dropped to 8 seconds. our dopamine
systems are FRIED from constant stimulation. but here's the thing, you can actually reverse this
damage. neuroplasticity is real, and your brain is WAY more adaptable than you think.
here's what actually worked after testing different protocols:


**the foundation: build your deep work capacity gradually**
most people try going from 0 to 4 hours of deep work immediately and burn out by day 3. your
brain needs training like a muscle. start with 90 minute blocks. that's it. research from Florida
State University studying elite performers found 90 minutes is the natural rhythm before
cognitive fatigue kicks in.
first month: one 90min block daily. second month: two blocks. by month six you can sustain 4+
hours but you need that ramp up period. anyone telling you otherwise is selling something.


**eliminate ALL notifications during deep work**
sounds obvious but i mean everything. phone in another room, not just silent. use apps like
Freedom or Cold Turkey to literally block distracting sites. i use Freedom and it's genuinely life
changing, blocks apps across ALL devices simultaneously, even has a locked mode so you
can't cheat. costs like $40/year but saved me hundreds of hours.
the book ""Indistractable"" by Nir Eyal (Stanford lecturer, wrote ""Hooked"" about tech addiction
first) breaks down the psychology behind why we constantly reach for our phones. insanely
good read. he explains that distraction is an INTERNAL trigger, not external, you're usually
trying to escape discomfort. once you understand that, you can actually address the root cause
instead of just white-knuckling through.


**time block your ENTIRE day**
this changed everything for me. Cal Newport's ""Deep Work"" is obviously the bible here (won
multiple awards, he's a Georgetown CS professor who's published 6 books using these
methods). the key insight: every minute gets assigned. even leisure time.
sounds restrictive but it's actually freeing because you're not constantly making micro-decisions
about what to do next. decision fatigue is real and depletes your willpower reserves.
i use a physical notebook. something about writing it by hand makes me actually stick to it.
digital calendars are too easy to ignore.


**protect your sleep like it's sacred**
you cannot do deep work on 5 hours of sleep. neuroscience is clear on this, sleep deprivation
absolutely destroys cognitive function, creativity, and memory consolidation. Matthew Walker's
""Why We Sleep"" will make you reconsider your entire relationship with sleep (he's a Berkeley
neuroscience professor, this book is considered the definitive guide).
7-9 hours non-negotiable. same sleep and wake times every day, even weekends. your
circadian rhythm needs consistency. i use blackout curtains, keep the room cold, no screens
90mins before bed.


**the attention residue problem**
this is the game changer nobody talks about. research from Sophie Leroy showed that when
you switch tasks, your attention doesn't immediately follow. part of your brain is still processing
the previous task.
solution: batch similar tasks together. all emails in one block. all meetings in one afternoon. all
deep creative work in the morning when your brain is freshest (for most people, circadian
rhythms peak cognitive function 2-4 hours after waking).


**build a shutdown ritual**
cal newport talks about this, you need a clear signal that the workday is DONE. mine is: review
tomorrow's time block, close all tabs, shut down computer, say out loud ""shutdown complete""
(sounds stupid but the verbal cue works).
this trains your brain that it can actually stop processing work stuff. without it, you get chronic
low-grade anxiety that prevents real rest and recovery.
the podcast ""Deep Questions with Cal Newport"" is perfect for this, he answers listener questions
about implementing deep work in messy real-world situations. way more practical than just
reading the theory.
if you want to go deeper but find reading these books time-consuming, there's this personalized
learning app called BeFreed that's been useful. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it pulls from productivity books, neuroscience research, and expert interviews to create custom
audio content based on your specific goals.
You type something like ""i'm struggling to build a deep work habit as someone with ADHD"" and
it generates a tailored learning plan with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute overviews to
40-minute deep dives. The depth customization is clutch, you can start with a summary and
switch to the detailed version if it clicks. Plus you can pick different voices (the sarcastic narrator
actually makes complex neuroscience way more digestible). It also has this AI coach you can
chat with mid-episode to ask questions or get clarification, which helps concepts stick better
than passive listening.


**strategic caffeine use**
most people are doing caffeine wrong. timing matters MORE than amount. research shows
caffeine takes 20-30mins to kick in, peaks at 45mins, and blocks adenosine (the sleepiness
chemical).
so: consume caffeine 20mins BEFORE your deep work block starts. and none after 2pm or
you'll trash your sleep. i use green tea instead of coffee now, more stable energy, L-theanine
smooths out the jitters.
**embrace boredom**
this is counterintuitive but essential. you need to practice being bored to rebuild your attention
span. take walks without podcasts. sit without your phone. let your mind wander. this is when
your default mode network activates and you get those creative breakthroughs.
your brain needs white space to consolidate learning and generate insights. constant input
prevents this processing time.


**track your deep work hours**
what gets measured gets managed. i use a simple spreadsheet tracking daily deep work hours.
seeing the data accumulate is motivating. plus you can identify patterns, which days are most
productive, what breaks your streaks, etc.
the insight timer app is also great for this, originally for meditation but i use it to time deep work
sessions. logs everything automatically so you can see your progress over months.
look, this isn't some overnight transformation. the first month genuinely sucks because your
brain is literally rewiring itself. you'll feel restless, uncomfortable, like you're missing out on stuff.
but around week 6-8 something shifts. you start entering flow states more easily. tasks that used
to take 3 hours are done in 90mins. the quality of your output noticeably improves.
six months of this and you're basically operating at a different cognitive level than 99% of
people. sounds dramatic but it's true. most people never do sustained deep work in their entire
lives.
the research is clear: deep work is becoming simultaneously more rare and more valuable.
those who master it will have massive advantages career wise and personally. your brain is
capable of WAY more than you think. you just need to give it the right conditions.",0,1770103111.0,psychesystems,1,0.5,False

1qulefv,https://i.redd.it/733g9is3d8hg1.jpeg,Oops... me thinks I might have overdone it a little bit.,"I did some light housekeeping today, sorted a little bit of laundry, and in the middle of a new insomnia window - sleep doc's not gonna be happy with my SD card next week but oh well he knows I have insomnia and it really messes with my sleep apnea (long Covid has blessed me so well 🙄). I thought it was bad when I hit 54 pace points during my last insomnia window 😂. Also, due to the fact that my resting heart rate during the past six weeks has been 47-50 and my sleep rate has arranged from 43 to 80 (thank you POTS/IST) and my heart rate range has been 40 to 90 except for my daily getting out of bed and getting dressed spike (that I think at 113 at the highest). 

I was put on propranolol which I liked but because I've always had low blood pressure my cardiologist wasn't very happy when I hit 80/60 and took me off that and put me on Ivabradine. I know that's the gold standard for IST but quite frankly I felt lousy since I started that in October. At the end of December I had a very bad flare and I was on my way to the cardiologist appointment and she was very concerned because my heart rate being low and my blood pressure being low (fun times when you have ME/CFS and fibromyalgia) but the palpitations were insane and they actually had to help me into the room because I thought I was going to have a syncope episode. So she added midodrine, 5 mg twice a day but make sure I take the second one in the early afternoon because it raises supine blood pressure.

Well that just made everything so worse and I have felt absolutely crazy fatigue and had to have someone walk my dog three times a day for the last five weeks. I literally have photographs of me by the machine in the hospital where my blood pressure was 160/90 and my heart rate was 41 but because I wasn't dying they decided to send me home after 19 hours of emergency room hell. My cardiologist wanted them to rule out a possible infection but they had no idea what to do with me and they stuck me in the back corner by the ambulance Bay and every time the ambulance showed up I was like -5 outside and I had a thin blanket. Some of my blood test came out a little weird, they did the normal CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, the cardiac trope they do on anyone that has Heart history and one I have never had done before, B-TYPE NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE, and of course a urine sample at hour 17 but they did give me a bag of juice the 19 hours I was there. I actually had to unhook everything to walk across the hall and go to the bathroom at 6 AM because the nurses weren't around, so I peed went back in and hooked up everything again and just kind of was like I gotta get the F out of here. Then a nurse came in and said oh we need a urine sample 😂 so I said bring me a cup of coffee with some half-and-half and I will give you a urine sample in a few minutes. Also during the 19 hours I was there they did a brain CT and a chest x-ray.

So the test results that were weird were the urine test – everything was negative and it was a clean catch but there was a lot of red blood cells even though it looked pretty clear to me it looked cloudy to them but everything else was negative and they don't know why there's red blood cells in my urine. My metabolic panel showed my protein really low which is crazy insane because during the five months of physical therapy - vestibular PT for dizziness which if you are dizzy I recommend you try to go through that because it's worth it and a L4 compression fracture and a wheelchair tipping over accident that broke T3-T5 (thank you long Covid for making my osteopenia turn into very serious osteoporosis in 20 months and thank God for teriparitide injections I do every morning to build a bone because I'm in the middle of teeth implants 🥴 (yes my life is very insane right now and I live alone and a lifetime of trauma and distrust has left me with no friends because I don't trust people and I'm very happy being alone I'm not lonely)) Sorry everyone, my ADHD is currently not being treated until my sleep doctor makes the determination to keep me on my precious Modafinil, which took me two years to finally get on 😥, and if he approves me staying on it my cardiologist wants me to go back on the Ivabradine😑.

OK I know I'm writing a book here and thank you for sticking with me. Back to my metabolic panel everything was good as far as my electrolytes and as I was going down the list looking for my abnormal results, I found it was protein 😱 and I drank a high protein boost every single morning , it's kind of my breakfast and that is 40% of daily protein plus I drink a protein milkshake every day which is 40% of my protein plus I eat a high protein diet to try to rebuild my muscles and bones. I've lost 120 pounds which is about half my body weight over the past couple years and my physical therapist recommended lots of protein. So for some reason I'm not absorbing the protein I'm ingesting, which means there is another problem which we don't know what is yet because I don't see my primary for another couple weeks and I've already sent him a message and ask him to please think about how to address this. My mother had celiac disease and younger brother has celiacs. But if I have it I'm kind of asymptomatic and I don't eat a lot of gluten but I don't seem to have an issue with eating gluten when I do have it so🤷🏻‍♀️. The peptide test showed that I was shedding proteins that your heart and arteries will shed if your heart is under stress and when your heart rate is that low and your blood pressure is that high of course your heart will be stressed so I'm thinking it's not serious because the number wasn't like in the thousands. 

Nuclear stress test is the day after tomorrow so if anyone has had one of those and could tell me their experience as far as how did they physically feel with the injection and is it really three hours to go through the injection and wait for an hour before the cardiologist starts taking pictures? They were very confusing on the phone as to the two sets of pictures and how long I would be spending with my cardiologist and told me I'd be there about three hours which Sunday like a lot. The good news was caffeine is what they used to counteract the medication so I can bring a thermos of coffee and chug out when they say go!! 

 So that brings everything to today. Today was the first day in months that my heart rate only drop to 52 but my heart rate during the day got as high as 153 hence burning through pace points. By sitting on the floor and sorting my laundry, adding about three dishes to my dishwasher and hitting start, and some very light housework because I haven't been able to do any housework in a while. So here is it 2 AM with an HR of 87 which feels weird just like a blood pressure of 112/70 feels weird. So maybe the midodrine is actually helping finally, but my blood pressure will spike up to hypertension levels like the 160/80 in the hospital about an hour after I take it and the half life is three hours so it doesn't stay in your system very long so I will probably need yet another medication adjustment. I'd really like to try Metoprolol or go back on propranolol with a lower dose of midodrine. 

I'm curious if anyone has had experience with that combination and if it works for them. The kind of running out of choices because some will cause serious interactions with my teriparatide. My HR was great on the lol meds it's just this bloody hypotension I've had all my life.

Thank you for letting me ramble and putting up with my ADHD brain which is in 1000 different directions right now. It is appreciated as well as any suggestions/advice someone may want to throw my way after they weighed through the tome I wrote. 🫣",1,1770103029.0,VisibleArmband,0,1.0,False

* South Auckland is apparently getting better every year, yet half the posts involve fighting neighbours, dumped rubbish, or asking whether to call the police or just move.  Both claims are made with total certainty.
* The price of a flat white is treated like a regulatory failure.  Anything over $4 is price gouging, and the solution is always intervention, never making coffee at home.
* No one in Auckland can park.  Ever.  Except the person posting, who is always an excellent driver surrounded by incompetence.  Bonus point - everyone hates Ranger drivers. 
* Supermarket prices trigger daily outrage.  There’s always a photo of cheese, bread, or whittakers, as if Woolworths personally woke up that morning and chose violence.
* Everyone hates landlords but also wants to own property in exactly the same areas, with exactly the same capital gains
* Public transport is unusable, but it must also be empty, fast, safe, cheap, quiet, and five minutes from everyone’s front door.
* The job market is completely screwed, apparently, and employers are unreasonable for not valuing very specific community college certificates in things like tarot card reading or one semester dipping your toes in the water of a BA. 
* Auckland is unliveable, broken, and declining… yet mysteriously no one ever leaves.

# Chapter 1 My Son Hated Me

“You’re unhappy in your marriage, so you want to wreck my happiness, right? “Zoe Riley, you’re rotten to the core,” Jordan Riley snapped. Bang! Jordan slammed the glass tumbler onto the floor, and shards of glass cut my calf. The sudden pain snapped me back to reality. I stared at Jordan, his face full of rage. My lashes trembled. What the hell was going on? A second ago, I was in the hospital from a car crash. And my son, the one I spent my whole life loving, smothered me with a pillow. Jordan saw me silent and got angrier. He kept throwing filthy insults at me. “You’re such an old-fashioned, backward woman. No wonder Dad divorced you. Being with you tarnished my whole damn person.” Just like in my memory, he kicked over the coffee table and smashed the TV. The sounds were crystal clear, which made me realize I’d been reborn. I scoffed inwardly at the thought; I must’ve been pathetic in my last life. Even Heaven couldn’t bear to watch, so it granted me a second chance to do it all over again. This time, I would not make the same mistakes. Jordan, were you ready for the kind of “love” I had in store for you? I narrowed my eyes and looked up at him coolly. This was the son I’d carried for forty long weeks and raised with the utmost care. When his father cheated, I chose to walk away with nothing, just to fight for his custody. I was terrified of him suffering, so I worked day and night to give him a life of comfort and security. I also worried that I wasn’t by his side enough. No matter how busy, I set aside one whole day every week to be with him. I gave him whatever he wanted. How could the person I devoted my life to raising, in a bid to please his girlfriend, be the one to shove me toward my grave? Life couldn’t be more ridiculous. Back in my last life, it happened when I kept him locked at home to stop him from marrying Lily Brooks. That’s when he flew into a rage. In my past life, I refused to back down. My son, knowing I was allergic to mango, put fresh mango juice in my porridge. At the time, I felt touched that my boy had finally grown up, cared for me, and understood me. It turned out it was all just a part of his scheme to get his way. If I hadn’t managed to call for help before I blacked out, I’d have died that day. He called me old-fashioned for refusing to let him marry Lily, a woman who’d been divorced. But what did he know? Lily was a vampire and a murderer. She had been divorced three times. Each of her ex-husbands died under weird circumstances. She collected big insurance payouts and then hunted for the next mark. And she never seemed satisfied. I pushed my rimless glasses up the bridge of my nose and spoke in a flat voice. “Old-fashioned? I ruined your dignity? Jordan, look at you! Everything you have is from me! Food, clothes, and money! So who the hell do you think you are, accusing me?” Crash! Another huge bang. He slammed the knife into the door right next to me, glaring at me with pure malice. “Zoe, do you know who you’re talking to?” he growled. I stood up without trembling. When I looked at him, I couldn’t tell if any love remained. Having lived through my own death, I knew he wouldn’t hesitate to kill me, even though I was the one who gave him life, raised him, and granted him every advantage. “Jordan, I can let you go,” I said. “But I’ll ask you one more time. “Are you absolutely determined to marry Lily? Even if I tell you she’s an insurance fraud and a killer, would you still charge ahead without hesitation and never look back?” Jordan angrily picked up the knife and slashed it at the door several times. “She’s nothing like that. I won’t let you slander her. Because you’re vicious, you think everyone else is too. I’m telling you, nothing’s stopping me today. If anyone tries, I’ll kill them.” If this had been my last life, I would’ve been terrified. But reborn, I’d lost hope in him long ago. I no longer had that reckless, self-sacrificing love that used to make me protect him. “Fine, Jordan,” I said, lifting my heavy lids. My expression was icy. “So even if I said we’re done as mother and son if you stick with her, you won’t regret it?” For a moment, his dark, violent eyes flickered. A flash of excitement crossed his face.",2,1770102674.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

1950s: The Convenience Decade

 \- The birth of the TV dinner

\- Rise of convenience foods like Jello-O and Wonderbread/packaged sliced breads

\- The classic 50s diner

1960s: Counterculture

\- More incorporation of international foods in the US

\- Early mainstream thought surrounding vegetarianism and the ethics of food

\- Early fast food e.g. McDonalds beginning to catch on

1970s - ???

1980s:

\- Possibly the most carefree in terms of health, a lot of rich and prepackaged foods without consideration of health consequences

\- Small kitchen appliances are widely owned and affordable, especially the microwave, blenders, etc. 

\- Government cheese

\- Successful diet products and celebrity-endorsed diets

1990s-2000s:

\- Low fat! No fat! Fat baaaad!

\- The rise of coffee culture

\- Interest in gourmet and artisan varieties, authenticity of international foods

\- Early inklings that maybe some of this stuff ain't good for you

2010s-2020s:

\- Food as the new luxury good for younger, more financially limited generations

\- Rise of food delivery apps

\- Significant push for healthy eating, unprocessed foods, plant-based foods

In particular, I'm interested in this idea that for younger people, expensive delivery and takeout food is a luxury product and that young people increasingly spend significant money on Starbucks coffees and UberEats. A generation that feels it lacks upward mobility seems to be OK with regularly dropping $30-40 on a meal as other luxuries and major purchases become further and further out of reach. 

Like... why food? Why is that the outlet? Why not something else? You'd think that Gen Z would abandon takeout and food delivery, but it's just the opposite. UberEats was probably conceived as a service for upper-middle class consumers, but instead it runs on broke college students.

I'm also interested in how pop culture affects food. Is there a connection between what's going on in music, film, political events, fashion, etc. and food?

1qukwq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1qukwq2/lesson_learned_set_expectations_about_guestsno/,Lesson learned: set expectations about guests/no guests at NF home in contract,"Background: I work from home, and our new nanny was interviewed and ultimately hired while I was away on a work trip. I did get a chance to do an initial screening call with her, but the in-person interview was with my spouse and the other families in our nanny share. Providing this context because I don't know what was discussed exactly during that interview. I do know that she has to bring her school-age daughter to work with her in the morning, and then someone else will pick up her daughter to take her to school. I don't have a problem with nannies bringing their children; several of our past nannies have done it, and it can work well depending on the situation.

The nanny share is in my home, because I work from home and can offer an extra pair of hands, if needed. But I try not to insert myself if unnecessary.

On the third day of the nanny's first week, I walked out of my office to get a coffee from the kitchen. As soon as I step out of my office, I can see a man in our bathroom. He's brushing the nanny's daughter's teeth.

The nanny had invited her ex-husband in to help her daughter get ready for school, and he'd be taking her to school afterwards. I'd never met him; she hadn't introduced me when he came in. I just came out of my room to see a stranger in my house. I was shocked, obviously. But after she introduced me, I was also trying to be understanding - maybe she didn't want to bother me while I was working, and maybe this had already been agreed to during the in-person meeting. She was starting work early, and I can understand how that interferes with school hours. She's a single mom, so I also want to be understanding of that.

But then. The second week, I come out of my office and her ex-husband is straight up... hanging out on our couch. He'd dropped the daughter off (her school day was just a half day) and was just hanging out for a while. He was there for like, 40 minutes.

I confirmed with the rest of the families in the share that bringing guests over to help with her daughter had NOT been discussed. At the end of that day, I sat down and told her I was not comfortable with any outside guests coming into my home. That her ex seemed like a nice enough guy (they were on good terms), but I did not know him, and I was not always presentable for outside guests (e.g., no bra), nevermind people who were not *my* guests.

She never brought anyone else to the house after that, and she was genuinely apologetic. She's a career nanny, so all I can chalk it up to is that different nanny families have different levels of acceptability about this sort of thing, and she assumed that it was fine with us because it had been fine at her past family. My lesson learned is to put these expectations (guests, giving out your address) very clearly in the contract, because what I thought was common sense was clearly not common sense to her.",12,1770101326.0,Nanny,15,1.0,False

I’m a STM and have a little boy who’s 2 and was born at 40+3, he was a 3B Tear due to Forceps and an episiotomy, he wanted to be face first which is pretty rare. I had pelvic floor therapy on the NHS, Probe test and saw a consultant to ensure I could delivery vaginally again. I could and I went for it. 

Woke up feeling constipated, so went downstairs made a coffee and went to toilet toddler woke up and I work part time so it was a ‘mummy and insert toddlers name here day’. Went on our usual outing; walk to the shop to pick up biscuits and stop at the cafe to see his nannas work. I needed the toilet again (mum and her boss kindly watched my son) some of my plug had come away but I moved on. Realised the pain of needing a poo is basically coming and going and not gone away and I realise this is it. 

Never got any closer together and never intensified, honestly I was coping pretty well at home. Rang Triage about 6ish and agreed that I sounded a bit too perky to come in, rang my mum and told her to gather some stuff expecting a long night) did toddlers nap, even read him a bedtime story at 7pm watched an episode of Miss Marple (don’t ask) when my waters broke. 

That waters breaking was the catalyst, my pain was suddenly off the charts and I wanted to push. Luckily we live a short drive away (15mins) and after a slight wait for admission to the unit we were in. I wanted the Labour Ward due to my previous tear BUT there was no time for that. They wheeled me into an empty triage room helped me get undressed, hooked me up to some gas and air. Before they even got their gloves on they said they could see a head. At this point I had to double check and definitely asked if they were sure. 

30mins later she was here. I thought I was about 6/7cm not 10 and I definitely didn’t think I was ready to push her out.

They helped coach me through the contractions and how to feel and how deep to push, applied counter pressure to try and stop tearing. 

Unfortunately I did come away with a 2nd degree tear. BUT. Compared to my last birth one it’s like night and day! I managed a wee meaning I didn’t traumatise my bladder like last time. I’ve not got the weak shaky feeling and I’ve been taking electrolytes that I packed in my bag. We should be discharged in a few hours. ",27,1770101153.0,PregnancyUK,3,0.97,False

Strawberry puree at the bottom, milk, and topped with matcha cream. Their nutritional value per their website is actually doable for me while I'm on a cut, and they are to DIE for!

  
The problem is, I can't seem to find a replica recipe. Every time I make my strawberry puree, it just tastes. . .off. I use fresh berries with vanilla extract and cane sugar and it just isn't right. The matcha cream is divine from CB and I'm looking to get as close as I can to that recipe as possible.

Got this yesterday and had a horrible dial in. Not the coffee's fault, I ground too fine but thankfully with milk the taste was manageable 😃

Dialed in much better today and the taste is great! It's a medium dark roast with a delicious body. The notes were not highlighted for me but there was some mellow flavor like caramel I could feel. 

Can definitely recommend for anyone else looking to try new coffee. 

P.S. on homegrounds app I see a lot of light or medium light roasts as recommendations with milk, is that feasible? Cause I have always thought light roasts with milk was a no no.",20,1770101026.0,IndiaCoffee,11,0.96,False

As no one goes to a Dunkin for a mortgage, my manager Lori and her ABM Scott came up with increasingly diabolical sales techniques to humiliate us.

 I didn't last more than six months before quitting. I share this story solely so you can find joy in how insane my life was. 

**Panhandling the drive up:**

My manager, Lori, decided that if business wasn't going to come to us, we'd go to them. She'd been told that grocery store branches did ""aisle time"", so we had to find something similar. Lori started by having us harass mornings commuters waiting in line for coffee, but cold conversations doesn't work in in a crowded line. Everyone else around us heard the sales pitch and already had a ""no"" ready to go upon making eye contact. 

We all told Lori about this issue, so she began to send us outside to the drive-up line, having us approach cars one by one while they were queued and waiting. I tried this for an entire line worth of morning commuters. The first lady thought I worked for Dunkin and started rattling off her order. When I told her I worked for the Bank inside the store, she said ""no thank you"" and rolled the window up.

Another gentleman assumed i was trying to scam him and told me that he knew I didn't really work for the bank. When I insisted I did and showed him my business card, he pointed out that no legitimate bank would ever approach drivers at a Dunkin' Donuts Drive up. He wasn't wrong.

Another lady rolled the window up as I approached, and quickly picked up her phone and began talking. I thought she was pantomiming to get rid of me until I heard her through the glass giving a physical description of me. She had called the police.

The police showed up at the branch by the time I had gone inside, and began questioning what the hell we were doing at a drive-up line. Lori tried to explain the concept of aisle time, but the police were adamant that we not do that again as we were ""disturbing the peace"". Lori blamed me for getting caught and gave me a verbal warning.

TLDR: manager at a Dunkin' Donuts in-Store bank forced me to panhandle the drive up for credit cards. It went about as good as you'd think.",9,1770100850.0,TalesFromYourBank,0,0.92,False

1qukpvy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qukpvy,"Day 2 of Inherited Grooves: 2026 Daily Vinyl from My Late Parents' Collection - Album: Sparkle, Artist: Aretha Franklin, released 1976","Day 2 of Inherited Grooves: 2026 Daily Vinyl from My Late Parents' Collection - Album: Sparkle, Artist: Aretha Franklin, released 1976

The soundtrack for the motion picture \*Sparkle\* was released in April 1976. My husband doesn’t distinctly remember his mom playing Aretha during his childhood. His best guess is that Aretha was someone his mom listened to quietly, on her own.

What we do know is this: in April of 1976, my 25-year-old mother-in-law was three months pregnant with her first child (my husband’s older brother). She and my father-in-law were living in Fulda, West Germany, where the U.S. Army had stationed him to guard the Fulda Gap. During the Cold War, the Fulda Gap was considered one of the most likely routes for a potential Soviet invasion from East Germany, and the area was heavily fortified as a deterrent.

In the absence of my husband’s memories - and drawing from the stories my mother-in-law shared with me about her time in Germany - this is the picture my head canon fills in: I imagine her seeing her husband off to work in the morning. After a long day of keeping house, she props her swollen legs on the orange upholstered stool in front of her favorite chair, closes her eyes, and savors a hot cup of coffee while this record plays.

I’ve only ever seen a portion of the original \*Sparkle\*, and I never had much interest in the 2012 remake. But after spending time with this soundtrack, I’m going to make a point to finally watch the film. A fun fact I learned today while telling my mother about this listening project: \*Sparkle\* was the first movie she ever saw in a theater without her parents. I jokingly asked if she skipped school to see it. She told me she and her friend Amelia went on the weekend it was ""a good time.""

1quklvj,https://i.redd.it/1lwjfyb158hg1.jpeg,This was disappointing!,"Tried Naivo after reading rave reviews here, but for some reason this one didn’t quite work for me. The taste felt rather generic. Like something you’d get from just about any light roast at a cafe. Could be a matter of taste I suppose, but I don’t think I’ll be ordering it again.

Also, I’d ordered this thinking it was Rs 550, which I felt was reasonable. When it arrived, I realised that was the price for just 100g of beans 😭 (and not the usual 250g). So yeah, that was another issue.

That said, the brew that worked best for me was:

17g / 255 ml, two blooms (the first at 50°C), followed by a single pour. Medium fine grind.

Has anyone else tried it?

P.S: Have also ordered Balanoor Chandragiri. I'm hoping I like that one better.
