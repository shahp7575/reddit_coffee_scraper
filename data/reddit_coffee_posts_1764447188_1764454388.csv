It’ll be good for both of us and I already partially started back at work (WFH before the holiday). 

I’m exclusively breastfeeding at home, but have been giving her 1 bottle of pumped milk a day to make sure she keeps the skill for daycare. Once she starts daycare though, I don’t want to give bottles at home unless I need to go out. 

My question is timing for getting ready in the morning before work and allowing time for a feed. Some mornings she only takes like 20 min to eat, sometimes she’s snuggly and takes 45+. I’ve been waking up early enough to shower (have to shower in the mornings due to leaking and sweat overnight lol) and get dressed before she wakes up, but would need to do makeup as well and get us out the door. I can have us both packed and my husband works for himself from home so he helps with breakfast/coffee. So how do I best plan around her feeds to make sure we get out the door on time? With her night wakes/feeds I want to try and sleep as long as possible. Do I just need to get good at doing my makeup at the same time as her eating if she’s going long?

I’ll have half a mug of coffee with cream, then have a energy drink at work (redbull or Celsius). I don’t get anxiety ever from drinking those two. But i actually feel like an idiot for switching my casual redbull or Celsius for a fucking bang energy. 

I’ve been feeling so sluggish from just my half mugs, I haven’t bought my usual redbull or Celsius so i asked someone for an energy drink and they had a bang so i was like cool that’ll do the trick.

I was way too eager, i cracked it open and took so many chugs in just under an hour. I didn’t feel anything until suddenly my heart was racing so fast and my vision started to look like 30 frames per second. I already have anxiety and pressure, and it all came in at once. 

I rushed so fast to the back offices because I genuinely felt like I was going to have a heart attack. The supervisor on board was luckily very sympathetic and let me stay back there and breathe and drink water. Then my manager let me go home early which honestly settled me down a bit. But I tell you I haven’t had an attack in so long and it was just as intense as I remember.

If so, I may have just the role for you!  Hello, a little about me, the author, and hopefully your new role-play partner. I am Em. I am 22 years old, but don’t let that deter you!!

Also, I would like this to take place on Discord, as I feel it’s easier to keep organized.  The last thing I would like to cover is the spicy stuff.  I do an 80/20 ratio. Which means 80 percent plot- or story-driven content. 20 percent spicy stuff. 

What would I like from you as a partner? I’m so glad you asked! I would like someone who can match my detail and length. Someone who likes to plan out ideas. Someone who enjoys OOC chatting. I’m hoping for friends as well. Now, with that out of the way, let’s get to the meat and potatoes of why you clicked. Or also known as the good part.

Role idea: 

Years ago, the two characters knew each other—maybe they were high school classmates, old neighbors, or college friends who drifted apart. Their lives went separate ways, and neither expected to cross paths again. But as the holidays approach, life throws them together in an unexpected way. 

Muse A (my character) and Muse B (your character) were friends in high school and college.  Maybe even dating.  They broke up years ago because religion was important to muse A and not to B.  So the world went on.  That was until a week before Christmas.  Muse B needs a plus one for an event.  Maybe an office Christmas party, a gala, or simply to keep his family off his back. Muse A just found out she was pregnant from a one-night stand.  As fate would have it, the two run into each other in the Christmas section of a store.  Or maybe at a coffee shop.  The two come to an agreement: Muse A will accompany him to his event.  Little did they know that fate would bring them together again, that they would have an epic love story. 



Writing Sample: 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes—five minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.

The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left.

Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact that Adrian slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.

Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.

That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrian was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.

It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.

That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world.  

""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.

Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.

The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.

PREGNANT.

In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.

All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow.  

With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa,"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.

Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end with, ""Papa loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.

1pa128a,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1pa128a/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Over the last year, I got completely obsessed with automating repetitive tasks in my workflows. I got tired of manually spying on competitor ads, copy-pasting data between CRMs, and figuring out AI video pipelines from scratch.

I dove deep into n8n (a workflow automation tool) and ended up building over 50 complex, ready-to-use automation blueprints.

Instead of letting them sit on my hard drive, I decided to clean them up and package them for others who want to skip the hundreds of hours of build time.

**Some of the harder workflows I built include:**

* 🕵️‍♂️ **FB Ad Spy Tool:** Automated scraping and analysis of competitor creative strategies.
* 🎥 **AI Video Systems:** Faceless video creation and viral short generators.
* 🤖 **Sales AI:** Automated sales agents, cold email systems, and meeting no-show eliminators.
* 🧠 **Operations:** Voice AI receptionists and WhatsApp agents.

These are the raw JSON files ready to import directly into an n8n instance.

If you are interested in jumpstarting your own automation setup, I’ve put them up on Buy Me A Coffee as a digital download pack.

I have type 2a/2b and have completed 2 PICLs so far. I’m a centrally sensitive patient, and you’ve been taking the “less is more” approach with my injections.

One thing I’m noticing is that talking seems to trigger symptoms, followed by 1–2 days where I feel flu-like, have increased neurological symptoms, and a lot of fatigue.

For context, I was bed bound for a while and rarely saw anyone. When I did, I didn’t talk much. Now I’m mostly homebound aside from very short outings or quiet walks (like a coffee shop or a store but usually weekday mornings for the purpose of less people/stimuli). When a friend is involved, the environment and visit duration are the same (usually 2-3 hours at my home or park. If outside of that and it’s a coffee shop, it’s quicker), but because I’m healing, I’m noticing I’m talking a lot more instead of just listening.

When I talk for an extended time — whether I’m sitting up or even lying down — I get a very “high” feeling, increased boat-swaying (which is always present but intensifies), and afterward my CNS seems unable to settle. Even brief visits leave me unable to sleep that night, and the next day I wake up with the flu-like feeling, increased neuro symptoms, and the jelly-neck sensation.

Part of me is happy that pieces of my personality are returning and I can talk and laugh more again. But I’m curious why talking is triggering these symptoms. Have you had other CCI patients deal with this and crash hard from it?",1,1764453057.0,PICL,0,1.0,False

Not for the first time, many of us deliver peak performance, carry entire projects on our backs, outperform half the level above us… and still somehow **just miss** that magical promotion. Again.

Meanwhile Leadership™ keeps dropping their usual wisdom:  
“Just work harder.”  
“Next cycle will be your cycle.”  
“Have you tried smiling more?”  
Sure. Thanks.

So here’s how you **really** get promoted.  
Not the official version. The *real* one.

We all know the pay on the lower levels is… a creative interpretation of “market competitive.” The promise is always:  
“Stick around, you’ll climb fast! One level a year! Maybe two!”  
Yeah, turns out that promise only applies if you know exactly the right people, attend the right coffee chats, or have your manager’s manager’s dog saved in your contacts.

If you don’t? You’ll sit on the same level forever.  
Ask me how I know.  
I’ve been stuck at **Level 11 for almost three (!!!)** years.  
Zero base pay increase. Not even an inflation bone thrown my way.

So here’s the trick — the only real one that worked:

Quit -> hanb in resignation -> switch consulting compay -> start as level 8 instead of level 11 (equivilant based on base pay, no all in)

So basically, there's never a time he can help. I give up. I want out. But I would go to hell and back for my kids, so the fear of him having them and ruining them even part time rips me to shreds. If the court didn't give me full custody (I've just heard it's not common these days), he would either get them on the weekends when it's fun time, they don't have work or school, and he can be the fun parent (and I have them through the week where I have to do all the work, school, errands, etc all the time like I do already) and never have fun time with them because of them having to be in school. Or I get them on the weekends and would only see them for 2 days. I might literally die of heartbreak. I'm depressed. I'm in decision paralysis. I don't know what to do anymore and hate this life.

1pa0lq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmAmazon/comments/1pa0lq7/how_to_pick_a_drawing_tablet_for_onthego_artists/,How to pick a drawing tablet for on-the-go artists?,"If you're an artist who loves creating anywhere – coffee shops, parks, or during your commute – you need a drawing tablet that can keep up with your lifestyle. But with so many options out there, how do you choose the right one?

**Size Matters When You're Moving Around**

The first thing to think about is portability. A massive 22-inch display tablet might be great for your desk, but it's not fitting in your backpack. Look for something between 10 to 13 inches. This size gives you enough drawing space without weighing you down. Most portable drawing tablets weigh less than two pounds, making them perfect travel companions.

**Battery Life Can Make or Break Your Session**

Nothing's worse than your drawing tablet dying right when inspiration hits. Check for models with at least 6-8 hours of battery life. Some pen displays and graphics tablets can last even longer. If you're serious about mobile digital art, this feature is non-negotiable.

**Screen or No Screen?**

You've got two main types to choose from. Pen displays have a screen where you draw directly on what you see. Graphics tablets are screenless – you draw on the tablet while watching your computer or phone. For on-the-go work, pen displays usually work better since you don't need to connect to another device every time.

**Pressure Sensitivity and Pen Quality**

Your digital stylus should feel natural, like using a real pencil or brush. Look for at least 4,096 pressure levels. This lets you control line thickness and opacity just by changing how hard you press. Also, check if the pen needs charging or uses batteries. Battery-free pens are way more convenient when you're traveling.

**Connectivity Options**

Make sure your drawing tablet can connect to your devices easily. USB-C is becoming standard and works with most modern laptops and tablets. Some wireless drawing tablets use Bluetooth, which is super handy when you don't want cables everywhere. Just remember that wireless connections can drain battery faster.

**Durability for Life on the Road**

Your portable tablet will probably get bumped around in bags and maybe face some rough handling. Look for ones with sturdy builds and scratch-resistant screens. A protective case or sleeve is also a smart investment.

**What About Price?**

Drawing tablets range from under $50 to over $2,000. For mobile artists just starting out, you can find solid options between $100-$400. Professional illustrators and graphic designers might want to invest more in premium features.

If you're ready to find the perfect drawing tablet for your creative adventures, you can check out [some great options here](https://athomewave.com/drawing-tablet) that fit different budgets and needs.

**Final Tips**

Read reviews from other artists who actually use their tablets outside the studio. Pay attention to comments about portability, battery performance, and how well they handle different drawing software. Also, make sure the tablet you pick works with your favorite art programs like Photoshop, Procreate, or Clip Studio Paint.

The right portable drawing tablet opens up your creative possibilities. You're not stuck at a desk anymore – you can sketch, paint, and design wherever inspiration strikes. Take your time comparing features, and you'll find something that matches your artistic style and mobile lifestyle.

1pa0ic0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakingPoints/comments/1pa0ic0/former_honduras_president_that_trump_pardoned_a/,Former Honduras president that Trump pardoned. A brief history,"Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado (born October 28, 1968), often called JOH, is a Honduran lawyer and former politician from the conservative National Party. He served as President of Honduras from 2014 to 2022 for two controversial terms, after earlier roles as a congressman (1998–2014) and National Congress President (2010–2013). Raised in rural Lempira Department as one of 17 children of a coffee farmer, he earned a law degree from the National Autonomous University of Honduras and a master's in public administration from SUNY Albany. Married to Ana García Carías since 1990, he has three children. 

His rule emphasized military-led security, conservative social policies (e.g., anti-abortion amendments), and U.S. alignment on migration and anti-Maduro efforts. He left office in January 2022, was arrested days later, extradited to the U.S., and is now incarcerated at USP Hazelton in West Virginia.

Politicial prosection 

Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York accused JOH of running Honduras as a ""narco-state"" from 2004–2022, conspiring to import over 400 tons of cocaine into the U.S. via bribes from cartels like Mexico's Sinaloa (including Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán).

New York New York 

He was convicted on March 8, 2024, on three counts: cocaine importation/manufacture/distribution conspiracy (21 U.S.C. §§ 952, 953, 960, 963) and firearms use (18 U.S.C. § 924(c)); sentenced June 26, 2024, to 45 years, an $8M fine, and 5 years supervised release. 

JOH denies it, calling it a ""revenge plot"" by traffickers and U.S. ""radical left.""

Core proof from flipped traffickers (e.g., murderers like Ardón/Rivera seeking leniency—reductions from life to 20 years). JOH called them ""professional liars"" motivated by revenge for his extraditions (24+ narcos sent to U.S.). No neutral witnesses to key handoffs; inconsistencies grilled on cross-exam (e.g., exact dates).

No direct JOH recordings/calls (e.g., intercepted warnings via ""network,"" not him personally); intel-sharing inferred from testimony/ledgers, not emails/texts. Palace visits prove access, not crimes.

Full transcripts/audio of calls/ledgers sealed under CIPA (protects methods/sources); only summaries/excerpts public (e.g., Guardian's ""gringos coming"" paraphrase). PACER paywall/redactions hinder scrutiny—feels like ""trust us.""

U.S. backed JOH for years (e.g., post-2009 coup aid and 2017 election recognition.

No seized cash from JOH personally; ledgers initialed ""JOH"" but could be coincidental. No El Chapo direct testimony (he's isolated). Broader: Honduras' corruption makes tracing hard

Timing (post-2021 election loss) suggests U.S. targeted him after anti-Castro alignment waned. Honduran media/evangelicals minimized verdict as ""doubtful."" No charges in Honduras.

This was certainly politicial prosection for being a Trump alley. Whether or not he is a good or bad person, did illegal things is irrelevant

Trump is balance. He's balancing the equation. He was the cause for his arrest..so he is now the cause for his release

* help missing persons cases (assisting with searches, or make useful spreadsheets, or something)
* regularly attend drum circles
* drink my coffee out on the balcony every morning (even in these northern winters!!!)
* hopefully I'll be skillful at something and can pass on my knowledge
* see operas and ballets
* make a homemade christmas album, just for fun!
* Play video games for hours and not feel too bad about it - maybe even join a PVP team!
* Finally be one those those ladies who can show up on a random tuesday at the state capitol to advocate or protest for things I believe in.
* Make cool Halloween costumes every year and just wander the streets on Halloween night to entertain everyone.
* Go on a cruise! (I've never been on one and there's just lots of other travel things I want to do before I retire.)
* learn a bunch of baking things like how to make christmas fudge and tartlettes and things, and I can be that neighbor lady who passes out free treats at christmas! (Can you tell I love holidays? LOL)

1pa0i5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1pa0i5j/my_coworker_keeps_messaging_me_does_he_want_to_be/,My coworker keeps messaging me - does he want to be more than friends?,"First time sharing something on Reddit ever and I’m  curious if someone has had a similar experience! 

Here it goes: I work in IT, so around 80% of people I work with are men and we work from home most of the time. About two months ago, I was introduced to a coworker who lives a couple hours away and only comes to the office maybe 3-4 times a year. We only talked to each other for a couple of minutes before I had to leave for a meeting. 

A week later, he randomly started messaging me on Teams. Especially the very first time was SO odd to me because he sent me a screenshot of how his outlook calendar showed I was the only one in office that day, saying something along the lines of “ohhh you’re all alone today? :(“. (For those who don’t know: you either have to add people on your outlook places app or they’ll show up after you had a Teams meeting with them, which we didn’t.) We casually chatted for a bit and then I got back to work. After that, he messaged me again and again. At first it was twice a week, then every other day, then literally every day including double texting when I didn’t reply. I engaged in the conversations because I’m easy to distract and tbh, it was really fun talking to him. 

Our conversations were NEVER about work but mostly unserious stuff, joking around, he told me a bunch of personal things and ended up asking me a lot of questions about how to organize a bigger move. We’re both 29 and I told him how I moved 4 times in the past 8 years, so I guess coming to me made sense?
After frequently messaging for around 3 weeks, I started questioning this whole “relationship”. I’m friends/friendly with other men at work, I even met one of my now closest friends at work who I’d tell anything and I don’t even talk as frequently to this friend as I do to my coworker (the protagonist of this story). 
The conversations are different too: he’s told me that he finds things I do or say “cute” or “sweet” or tells me to take care of myself whenever I’m doing overtime or work on weekends. I know he’s friends with a lot of women, grew up with sisters and generally, is a friendly, bubbly man who’s comfortable around women but still, this felt like he had more in mind than connecting with a coworker or being friends. 
Right before he moved, he told me that he wants to go get coffee with me as a way of thanking me for helping him with the move. For that, he set up a weekly 2h meeting on Thursdays for him and me, so we could either go to a cafe or hang out in one of the meeting rooms. HELLO?! What in the corporate slavery?! 

The continuous attention, compliments and fun conversations really confused me. If this was outside of work, I wouldn’t even hesitate and make a move or something but that’s literally one of the worst ideas possible. Plus I’m not even sure if I’m genuinely interested in him or just the attention, if I’m being honest. It’s hard not constantly thinking about him when he texts me from 9-5 and sometimes even after office hours. 

A month ago, he moved closer to where we work and when we first saw each other in person at work after the daily teams messaging, it was AWKWARD! He came in a little late, took a teams call and after he was done, he got up from his desk, greeted me and hugged me. 💀😭😭 I mean a lot of people hug and he definitely hugged other female coworkers who he has known longer but it the way he went about it was just idk. My work bestie (the one I mentioned) even asked me how I knew him and why he hugged me, lol. 
And yes, we did block a meeting room that day and had our 2h Thursday meeting. 😭 Just this once though because the week after, I wasn’t in office so instead we did a 1h teams meeting and then we agreed that we can’t do that every week, as fun as it is. 

Now onto what happened within the past few days, it’s BAAAAD! 
Last Friday, we were out do get drinks with some other colleagues. Even though we were mostly talking in little groups, him and I were glued together, so I assumed that was the final sign I needed to be sure about him liking me more than just as a friend. 

On Monday, he asked when I’ll be at the office this week and I told him I won’t be there on Thursday due to a two day workshop but asked him if he wanted to still come in so we could hang out, but he said he didn’t want to because I’d be busy all day anyways. I then said in that case, I could come in on Thursday too but he refused saying he doesn’t want to inconvenience me. I told him that it’s not an inconvenience and that he should just say if he wants to see me this week. - This is the part where it’s getting bad because who says that 💀. 
He then said he’s always happy to see nice coworkers on office days. And that’s where I messed up more and more LMAO! That’s how it went down: 
me: “oh well.” 
him: “wrong answer?” 
me: “well.. yea!” 
him: “I feel like you’re angry or frustrated with me but I don’t know what I did wrong, I’m sorry” 
me: “I’m not angry, I’m just a little confused tbh” 
him: “confused? how?”
me: “isn’t that obvious?” 
him: “I hope I’m guessing right because it’ll be awkward if I don’t but I see you as a friend!” 
💀💀💀💀💀💀 and then I lied: 
me: “omg thank you I’m sooooo relieved!!” 
him: “I just have a flirty personality I guess. so.. should we just continue as is? is that okay for you?” 
me: “yeeessss of course!” 
One important thing: I never interpreted what he said as flirtatious at all! to me, it’s more about the frequency, worrying about me, telling me I did good or stuff like “you have golden retriever energy”

And then we went back to whatever we call normal. 
I expected him to distance himself from me because if I were him, I wouldn’t have believed me after alllll of the things we’ve said and told each other in the past 2 months. Anyways, the first thing I see the next morning is a fucking Teams message of him saying “good morning, I hope you have a great first workshop day!” - Be so fr, dude 🫩. 
I felt like it got even worse after that situation on Monday. It was constant messaging again and on Wednesday morning he started the convo with “Hiiii, how’d you sleep?” (Cause I told him how exhausted I was the day before). 
I know he literally told me that to him, we’re friends but what the fuck is this behavior? I feel like he’s playing some sick game or maybe liked me at first and doesn’t but wants to keep me on the hook? I DONT KNOW! If the friendship developed in a different way and the initial approach was mutual and not him texting me over and over and over again, I wouldn’t have read as much into it. As I said- there are lots of nice men who I’m friendly with but none of them slides in my teams dms full time. 

I got so incredibly frustrated with this man that on Thursday night (so two days ago & I didn’t go into the office), I told him that I’m sorry for not being clear earlier this week, that I’m still confused, that I don’t know how I feel and that I don’t want him to message me for a while if he meant what he’s said on Monday. I also said it’s not that I never want to talk to him again or don’t want to be friends and that I’m not angry but it’s just that I need some space and don’t like the situation as is. He replied that now, he’s confused because he thought I was relieved when he told me we’re friends, that he did mean what he’s said, that he respects my boundaries and will wait for me to text him. 

As you may assume, I’m a very confrontational, honest and straight forward person while he’s someone who likes to keeps his peace, said that he’s a little insecure doesn’t like approaching new people and has a hard time confronting people as well. 

I guess my overall question is: has someone been in a similar situation and explain to me why he’s behaving like this? I mean he literally told me how he feels and I’m not delusional but since he’s a shy little nerd, part of me still thinks he’s just scared. 
No one can convince me that this a normal way to approach a (work) friendship and it’s driving me crazy! I wish I could read his mind and know what he truly thinks about me and whether he was interested or not.  Partly because I feel like I need clarity and partly because at some point I started gaslighting myself into liking him back because I know he’s a good man with good values. 
After I told him off, I felt a million times better about the situation. I’m also aware that dating at work is the worst idea ever and that I’m still unsure about how I truly feel about him.

I’ve been having hemiplegic migraines since May. I’ve been seeming a neurologist since June and had all the tests - CT scan, MRI, blood work - and they reckon migraines are what's causing everything.

I'm on 50mg of Nortriptyline at the moment. Started taking CBD oil which helped for a bit but it seems to have stopped working. For the past week I've had constant numbness and tingling in my ring and little fingers on my right hand.

Honestly though, I can cope with the numbness. What's really getting me down is how exhausted I am all the time.

I used to walk and run 5K a couple of times a week. Now I can't even walk my dog. If I try to do anything physical, I'm completely wiped out for two days afterwards. Working from home has been brilliant, but when I go into the office for half a day once a fortnight, it absolutely drains me.

I'm doing everything I should be - managing stress with meditation and pottering in the garden, avoiding things I know trigger me (coffee, chocolate, red wine, and I think gluten too). This condition has completely turned my life upside down.

So my question is: for those of you dealing with hemiplegic migraines, what actually works for the tiredness? I'm not talking about stopping the migraines themselves (though any tips welcome) - I mean what helps you actually function when you're constantly shattered?

1pa0czf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pa0czf/sf_the_halo/,[SF] The Halo,"The Neuroreality engine. 

I never meant it to be this. 

I remember the day it finally launched. People lined up for hours to experience the latest technological marvel. It started as a simple college project. A way for dreams to be visualized and imagination to bleed onto screens. The first dreams were able to be captured, recorded, and replayed. 

 It wasn’t long before Eidolon noticed. The weeks following the launch party, the Neuroreality engine vanished. Any and all details vanished without a trace; replaced by 404 and error messages. The laptop was seized, the property bought, and the college paid. 

Months later, the Halo appeared. Under another name, the Neuroreality engine had been absorbed, mutilated, and repurposed. It was no longer a fragile engine. It was more... polished. More corporate. Engineers had reverse engineered the dream painter into something for rendering things directly into the brain. It wasn’t a breakthrough anymore. It was a product. 

The iterations began. Each Halo update became more surreal, more lifelike, more dreamlike. It was expensive at first, a crown of shiny plastic and signal for those who could afford it. Then the developers made a major improvement in the graphics rendering, “Iteration 4 of the Halo engine,” they called it. It cut computing power by 60%. It also cut costs by 60,000 dollars. 

Everyone got the Halo. Everyone wanted to be the angels of their own digital worlds. No one wanted to face reality. The Halo. Filter reality through our crown. Why remain in this world when you can ascend into ours? They promised freedom. They promised a utopia. Who could resist that offer? The economy was crashing. Disease ran rampant. Government was corrupted. 

The Halo was quickly fully integrated. Nobody left their homes. Streets were swallowed by leaves and weeds. Exercise, vacation, it all became the past. No one was ever offline. But the simulated reality was just a facade. Each memory, thought, name, all archived. Stored. Collected. 

The corporation couldn’t keep up with the demand. The day Neuroreality became the only reality. Memories started costing money. Experiences became a paid premium. ""Just two dreams for ascendance."" They promised. Where those dreams went... no one knew. 

Cathedrals of data centers shook the earth. Hundreds of them, humming, a constant, faint sound that chased you everywhere. Animals thrived. Buildings emerged from overgrown jungles of vines and plants. But everyone knows utopia is rhetoric. 

The glitches were subtle at first. One or two people that stopped being online. Then it spread. Realities merging, coalescing... vanishing. The worlds became... Unstable. Parts of reality phased in and out of existence, ""flickering,"" they called it. Some were trapped in time loops. Others couldn't log off at all. Clouds forgot render. Shadow's lagged. Developers claimed they were updating the systems. No one really knew. 

I don’t remember what happened after that. Maybe I haven’t paid the monthly fee. 

I never meant it to be this. 

I wanted to give the world a way to see their dreams, not a way for Eidolon to see mine. 

I guess this is just god’s cruel way of punishing us for mocking him with our Halos and false heavens, for replacing his world with our own twisted version. 

I wonder if they remember how It all began. A dorm room. Coffee on late nights. A cracked laptop. 

They probably locked that behind a paywall too. ",1,1764451805.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

What takes able people a hot minute takes me a couple of hours and some time to recover, right? I mean house cleaning and cooking prep/shopping, etc. My family is small, just my son and my dad were coming over to my house for Thanksgiving dinner today. Dad lives 10 minutes away in a retirement place and my son is about an hour and a half drive away. Dad has early stage dementia. We live in a Midwest state that's under a snow warning for the weekend, supposed to be worse tomorrow. Today is a light dusting, which started about 1pm. 
So, I started shopping 10 days ago, and cleaning up 7 days ago. The floors took me an entire day because I really can't bend over often because I get dizzy and headaches if I don't stop about every 15 minutes, you get the idea. The bathroom took an entire day. 

I did a lot of food shortcuts (ready made gravy, storebought pie) despite the extra cost because I wanted the traditional meal. I was so happy to have them coming over.

Well. Dad showed up an hour early expecting to be entertained right NOW. He literally followed me around at my side as I was doing last minute cooking. Chattering in my ear. I about fell on him quite a few times. I finally handed him a coffee and set him up in a chair to watch. 

My son rolled up a half hour late, told me I shouldn't have gone to this trouble and expense. Talked about what a nice brunch he'd gone to this morning with friends. Then said he was stressed out about the snow and left right after pie. Said Dad didn't know who he was.
Dad left when he did.

My son then complained about the stuff that I'd given him to take home. (I just moved and had stuff for him) Said he had a terrible time getting it into his house because of the snow and he didn't have help. (It's snowing harder where he lives) And now it was taking up space he couldn't spare in his house. 

Honestly I cleaned the kitchen, got on a bathrobe and made myself a drink. At least my house is clean.  I'm feeling heartbroken. ",5,1764451799.0,disability,1,0.86,False

How can i find out the root cause of brainfog?","Hello. I’m 18, male. I’m coming to you with a question and asking for help.

In 2019, during the first wave of COVID, I got COVID. Before that, the only health issue I had was mild OCD that appeared rarely and was related to religious topics, but it didn’t really bother me. After I had COVID, I developed all the symptoms I describe below.

At the moment I have: brain fog, depersonalization and derealization, depression((I'm sure I have depression, but I'm not sure if it arose from stress caused by Covid and brain fog or if it is the cause of them.)), blurry vision, severe OCD, forgetfulness (possibly related to OCD), bags under my eyes. Because of all this, sometimes it’s hard for me to walk — I walk unsteadily and sometimes lose balance, swaying from side to side. One of the important symptoms is sleepiness/fatigue that never goes away. Sometimes I think how great I would feel if I just wasn’t this exhausted. So far, I’ve only managed to slightly reduce this fatigue by waking up early — on these days I feel a bit more energetic.

I also want to say that right after COVID my OCD suddenly became much stronger and started interfering with everything I did, not letting me live normally, even though I didn’t feel any fear during the pandemic. That’s why I tend to think COVID did something biochemical(maybe its depression) that could have worsened the OCD. Perhaps this is neuroinflammation that has somehow persisted for 5 years.

I read an article on selfhack.com that said these conditions go hand in hand because of limbic system exhaustion, and that if a person was fine before a viral infection, then the infection is most likely the cause. But I don’t understand how to find the real reason and cure it, because depression feels like the last thing I’m able to “check.” So I’m asking you to help me figure this out.

What’s interesting is that I rarely get short moments of partial clarity lasting about 15 minutes. During these moments, my vision becomes normal, I start realizing where I am and what I’m seeing in front of me, and movements that usually feel strange and sharp become smooth and I can actually feel them. My gait becomes more confident because I start feeling the ground under my feet. These clarity episodes have different triggers: sometimes it happens from Ginkgo biloba, other times during a walk, a couple of times after coffee. Once, they took three tubes of blood for several tests, and after about two and a half hours I had a clarity episode that lasted a few minutes. Can this happen simply during post-COVID depression?

P.s. One person on reddit said it might be a kind of placebo from the body when you try something stimulating for the first time or after a long break, but it still might be worth paying attention to these things.


Here is what I have already tried:
MRI of the brain, duplex ultrasound of the neck vessels, many blood tests (clotting, viscosity, inflammatory markers, erythrocytes, important vitamins, testosterone, folic acid, cortisol, important vitamins, etc.), thyroid hormones, an oxygen saturation test (the fingertip one). Everything was normal.

I took: glycine, Ginkgo biloba, Zoloft, Mexidol, ribose capsules, magnesium.
• I received 10-day courses of Cerebrolysin IV twice.

• For a long time I had a deviated nasal septum, so I had surgery a month ago.

• I tried the keto diet, then water fasting for two days. There was no improvement.

This post is for anyone struggling with test anxiety. Sorry in advance for the long post, but I hope it helps someone.


I’ll be honest — Mark K lectures + Bootcamp + L-theanine were the biggest reasons I passed. I prayed for it to stop at 85 questions, but once I hit 120 I knew it will go to 150 BUT I knew I was still in the game. I treated those last 30 questions like my life depended on them. I didn’t let the number discourage me — I reminded myself that those final questions determine pass or fail, so I stayed laser-focused.



Between breaks I did breathing exercises, prayed, and even looked at myself in the bathroom mirror. Instead of saying, “God please let me pass,” I changed it to, “I know I passed. Thank you.” When I sat back down, I wrote RN next to my name and kept glancing at it whenever I needed to calm down.



My therapist also gave me a tip that helped a lot: keep a rubber band on your wrist and snap it whenever you feel yourself going into panic — it instantly pulls you out of that spiral and grounds you back into reality.



I also used the box breathing technique during the exam to stay centered. And whenever a hard question popped up, I refused to spiral — I reminded myself that it meant I was doing well. Even when I had to guess, I made sure they were smart guesses.



My exam breakdown:



• 19 SATA



• 7 case studies



• 3 bow ties



• LOTS of priority (and that’s how I knew I was passing — my first attempt barely had any)



If you have test anxiety, please hear me: I have it BAD. Being a straight-A student didn’t save me the first time — my anxiety crushed me. So this time I changed everything.



I stopped studying in total silence. I went to coffee shops, the beach (I’m lucky to live close), and even studied around noise, movies, and my crazy dog. I needed distractions so that, on test day, noise wouldn’t trigger my anxiety.



I re-learned Mark K until I understood him, not just listened. I took care of my mental health. I started magnesium glycinate at night about a week before the exam. I also took L-theanine (my therapist recommended it because it doesn’t change brain chemistry). It honestly helped so much — it kicks in within an hour and made me feel calm. Of course, talk to your doctor first and test it beforehand.



My study stats this time:



• 80% of Bootcamp completed



• 67% standalone average



• Three “Very High” readiness scores



• Archer & UWorld: 1 readiness each



• ~2,000 total practice questions



My first attempt? I finished all Bootcamp questions, scored 61% average and 3 very highs, and still failed. The difference this time was mindset, strategy, and HOW I studied.



And one thing someone commented to me that truly stuck — and changed how I studied — was this:



👉 “It doesn’t matter how many questions you do. You could do 10,000 questions and still fail if you don’t understand what the question is REALLY asking.”



That hit me HARD.



Because it’s true.



This time, I focused on learning HOW to answer NCLEX-style questions.



Dr. Sharon, Mark K, and even the international crusades teach you exactly this — HOW to think, how to break down the stem, how to choose the safest and most logical option.



You have to walk in thinking you already passed. If you beat yourself up, you lose before the exam even starts.



I also truly believe my testing center helped — it was spacious, quiet, later in the morning, and the staff was so kind. I slept well and went in calm.



YOU GOT THIS.



Ask me anything — I’ll help however I can.

But.. I hate this. I knew it could be uncomfortable but I didnt expect this. Ive felt like this since week fucking 3 and Im 7 weeks (9 with the LMP rubbish) now and heres what Ive got-

* Nausea all the time. All the time even with medication. No vomitting, so doctor doesn't seem too bothered as Im not 'in danger'.

* I don't have any particular aversions it's just that nothing at all is appealing. So Im hungry, but never know what to eat and it stresses me out trying to find food I can at least tolerate.

* When I do eat, Im bloated.

* Even drinks!! I cant drink tea or coffee suddenly, I never liked fizzy drinks anyway.. I used to love squash and cordial but now.. I can't stand it. I am sipping water but it's so boring and even that makes me feel sick anyway.

* Im hot then cold and this means I can't sleep and my usual soothing showers are awful because theyre never right. Also I cant cuddle up to my always-boiling husband :(

* There's something about my husband's face that smells of.. stuff. Food, or toothpaste, or just his skin that makes me not comfortable kissing him :(

* We tried sex and intimacy and I have fucking awful painful cramps when I orgasm, so even when I did get a brief interest when nausea paused for half an hour after taking the meds, I didnt want sex or anything because of this.

* Im tired but not sleepy tired, more like depression tired. My brain is taken up with so much thought of nausea I cant even get off my ass and wash the pots.

* My nipples hurt with even a stiff breeze blowing on them.

I have been robbed of my energy, my intimacy with my husband, any kind of enjoyment of eating, Im thirsty but dont want to drink, even just sitting and watching TV the nausea is all the damn time so I cant really enjoy anything, and it's winter so if I do manage to get out Im too hot or too cold.

Does anyone else feel thoroughly miserable? I know I should be grateful we've conceived seemingly with no trouble but I keep crying because.. well it's just so unfair, not a single thing in my life is unaffected.

I also had a follow up with my endocrinologist last week and my prolactin levels went up again (due to a pituitary tumor, and I stopped taking the medication because it causes me headaches occasionally among other things, because why wouldn’t it??). She said my migraines could have increased due to the tumor pressing on things and prescribed me a different medication to try. But of course I’m not starting a new medication in the middle of a migraine issue. So yesterday morning I woke up with a migraine again, and I couldn’t take another sumatriptan so I took a Nurtec only. My migraine got slightly better, then started getting worse. I was looking in my cabinet for something and spotted my B12 (plus B2 and B6). I decided to take it for some reason. My migraine was gone within 30 minutes. I forgot I hadn’t taken my B vitamins in probably close to a year. I also have been dealing with an eczema flare on my face for about a month too, plus a few red spots that weren’t acne. My medication wouldn’t work on it (tacrolimus, a topical immunosuppressant). It has never failed me before. My face looks great today (but be warned, B12 can also cause breakouts and usually does for me, but it’s not happening this time for some reason). I’m seriously shocked by these results. I just wanted to share my story because I feel so much better and am so grateful, I could cry. 
 
 *I follow a gluten free diet so I don’t get any of my vitamins/minerals from enriched breads and pastas, which is why I take a B complex a few times a month. So this might not be useful to a lot of people. 
I also take ADHD medication which also depletes vitamins and minerals. I take magnesium already. 

I’m sure this has probably been shared before. But I was shocked at the immediate results. So it’s probably good for other GF people and vegetarians and vegans to think about. Also regular drinkers. Alcohol depletes B vitamins. Maybe get B levels tested to see if supplements would be appropriate. ",6,1764451084.0,migraine,1,0.88,False

Discover hyper-local, spontaneous micro-adventures right from your Telegram chat.



# Problem

Many people feel stuck in daily routines, lack inspiration for spontaneous local activities, or struggle to discover new aspects of their immediate environment without extensive planning or cost. They crave small, engaging experiences to combat boredom or enhance their breaks.

# Mechanics

Users start the bot and can optionally share their location for hyper-local accuracy. Upon requesting a '/wander' or '/adventure' command, the bot generates a unique, context-aware micro-adventure prompt. Examples include 'Find the oldest tree within a 15-minute walk', 'Visit a new coffee shop 3 blocks east', 'Discover a public art installation nearby', or 'Research a quirky historical fact about your neighborhood'. Users can then share their completed adventures, photos, or insights back into the bot, earning points or badges for participation.

    ## 3. Database Schema (Prisma)
    
    Design the `schema.prisma` for PostgreSQL to store user information, adventure prompts, and gamification elements (points, badges).
    
    ```prisma
    // prisma/schema.prisma
    generator client {
      provider = ""prisma-client-js""
    }
    
    datasource db {

    ## 4. Core Bot Logic Flow
    
    Outline the main interaction flows and the responsibilities of each component.
    
    ### 4.1. Bot Initialization (`src/app.ts`, `src/bot/index.ts`)
    
    *   Load environment variables.
    *   Initialize Prisma client.
    *   Create Telegraf bot instance with the provided `BOT_TOKEN`.
    *   Register all command handlers and middlewares.
    *   Start the bot in long polling mode (for local development) or set up webhook (for production/Lambda).
    
    ### 4.2. `/start` Command (`src/bot/commands.ts`)
    
    *   **Welcome Message**: Greet the user and explain the bot's purpose.
    *   **User Registration/Update**:
        *   Check if the Telegram user (`ctx.from`) exists in the `User` table.
        *   If not, create a new `User` record with `telegramId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `username`.
        *   If exists, update `firstName`, `lastName`, `username` if they changed.
    *   **Location Prompt**: Ask the user if they'd like to share their location for hyper-local adventures using a custom keyboard button.
    
    ### 4.3. Location Sharing (Telegraf `on('location')` handler)
    
    *   **Store Location**: When a user shares their location via Telegram's native location sharing feature, extract `latitude` and `longitude`.
    *   **Update User Record**: Store the `latitude` and `longitude` in the `User`'s database record.
    *   **Acknowledgement**: Send a confirmation message that the location has been saved.
    
    ### 4.4. `/wander` or `/adventure` Commands (`src/bot/commands.ts`)
    
    *   **User Context**: Retrieve the current user's record from the database.
    *   **Location Check**:
        *   If the user has a saved `latitude` and `longitude`, use it.
        *   If not, politely remind the user to share their location first.
    *   **Adventure Generation (`src/services/adventureGeneratorService.ts`)**:
        *   Call `adventureGeneratorService.generateAdventure(userLatitude, userLongitude)`:
            *   This service will use the provided coordinates.
            *   It might call `locationService` to query OpenStreetMap (Nominatim for reverse geocoding to get a general area name, or Overpass API for specific POIs like ""oldest tree"", ""coffee shop"", ""art installation"" within a radius).
            *   Based on location context and available data, it crafts a unique and engaging micro-adventure prompt.
            *   Example prompts:
                *   ""Find the oldest tree within a 15-minute walk near [Park Name].""
                *   ""Visit a new coffee shop 3 blocks east of [Street Name] and describe its vibe.""
                *   ""Discover a public art installation nearby in [Neighborhood] and share its story.""
                *   ""Research a quirky historical fact about [User's Neighborhood] and share it back.""
        *   Store the generated adventure in the `Adventure` table, linking it to the `User`, setting `status` to `PENDING`, and recording `generatedLat`/`generatedLon`.
    *   **Send Prompt**: Send the generated adventure prompt to the user.
    
    ### 4.5. Adventure Completion (`/complete` command or Contextual replies)
    
    *   **User Intent**: To simplify, assume the user indicates completion via a `/complete` command or by replying to the adventure message (if Telegraf allows easy context linking). A `session` could store the `currentAdventureId` for the user.
    *   **Identify Active Adventure**: Find the user's most recent `PENDING` adventure from the database.
    *   **Capture Completion Details**:
        *   **Text/Insight**: If the user sends a text message after `/complete`, store it in `sharedInsight`.
        *   **Photo**: If the user sends a photo, download it (or get its file ID and generate a shareable URL if applicable for storage like S3/Cloudinary), and store the `sharedMediaUrl`.
        *   **Location**: Optionally, if the user shares a location again, store it as `completedLat`/`completedLon`.
    *   **Update Adventure**: Set the `Adventure`'s `status` to `COMPLETED`, update `completedAt`, `sharedInsight`, `sharedMediaUrl`, and `completedLat`/`completedLon`.
    *   **Gamification (`src/services/badgeService.ts`, `src/services/userService.ts`)**:
        *   Award points to the user (`userService.addPoints(userId, 10)`).
        *   Check for badge achievements (`badgeService.checkAndAwardBadges(userId)`):
            *   Example badges: ""First Wanderer"", ""5 Adventures Completed"", ""Photo Explorer"", ""History Buff"".
        *   Notify the user of points earned and any new badges.
    *   **Acknowledgement**: Confirm the adventure completion and thank the user.

    ## 5. Environment Variables (`.env`)
    
    Provide an `.env.example` file outlining all necessary environment variables for the bot to function.
    
    ```dotenv
    # .env.example
    
    # Telegram Bot Token (obtain from BotFather)
    BOT_TOKEN=""YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE""
    
    # Database Connection String for PostgreSQL
    # Example: postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database?schema=public
    DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://localwander:password@localhost:5432/localwander_db?schema=public""
    
    # OpenStreetMap Nominatim API Base URL (for reverse geocoding/POI search)
    # Default Nominatim server, consider hosting your own or using a paid service for high traffic
    OPENSREETMAP_API_BASE_URL=""https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org""
    
    # (Optional for more advanced POI queries) Overpass API
    # OPENSREETMAP_OVERPASS_API_BASE_URL=""https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter""
    
    # (Optional) Cloud Storage for shared media (e.g., AWS S3 bucket name)
    # If not using, bot will simply store Telegram file_id or ignore media URL.
    # S3_BUCKET_NAME=""your-s3-bucket-for-photos""
    # AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID""
    # AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY""

1pa01jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1pa01jn/day_7_experience_going_crazy/,Day 7: experience & going crazy,"This is my first surgery, so wasn't entirely sure how my body would respond. Additionally, I'm so used to being the caregiver and am someone who is constantly on the go. The role reversal is driving me crazy. 

I have a strong family history of gallbladder disease, so it shouldn't have been a surprise. But I never really had any concerning symptoms (I thought) and don't eat fast food or very greasy foods. 

That said, I had one gallbladder attack (horrific!) while out of town for work. ER did an ultrasound and confirmed an inflamed gallbladder. I refused surgery, so they patched me up with antibiotics and anti-nausea meds. I refused morphine because I wanted to catch my flight home. 

Anyway. Fast forward and my PCP and surgeon confirmed I needed it removed. I was really nervous, but they treated me lovely during pre-op/prep and gave me an anti-anxiety. They said I'd blink and be done, but I actually remember all the way up until they gave me the mask to breathe in the OR.

I woke up in pain (7/8) and they gave me two doses of dilauded which knocked it down to a 4. They gave me a perc before I went home because it was about 45 min drive. 20 min in and I was super nauseous. My husband stopped and picked up jello which helped some. 

Day 0-2: PAIN - it hurt to get up, lie flat, lie on my side, sit...basically everything. Gas pains weren't that bad and I was able to shuffle around and get some of it out. DIET - I was scared to eat even though they said I could eat normally besides spicy foods and to go slow with fatty foods. So these days I was mostly liquid broths or apple sauce/jello. Also, my appetite has been very low. VOIDING - the day I got home I could not pee for the longest!! Was so worried and right when I thought I'd have to call to see if I would need to go in and get a cath, I was able to void. SLEEP - slept in an incline. Also, I set alarms for pain meds. Note: day 2 I went on a walk around the loop in front of my house (which is big, I live rural...it was too early and I ended up in a lot of pain.)

Day 3-4: DIET - graduated to soft foods, rice, toast, low-fat yogurt. PAIN - was able to switch to OTCs. I was able to shuffle (walk) a little longer than before. SLEEP - a little better but getting comfortable was difficult sometimes.

Day 5: I sneezed and literally thought I had ripped open so many stitches. Worst, acute pain of my life. I scared the shit out of my kids because I fell to my knees, was shaking, breathing like I was in labor...horrific. Went back to the percs. 

Day 6: PAIN - back to OTCs. Sleeping much better but also need to nap during the day. My hubby says it's because I need to heal. DIET - We went out to a restaurant and grocery store. My first very big meal! No GI issues. My abdomen was really sore by the end due to walking and being in the car, but overall the trip was okay. I'm walking a lot faster than the first few days but much slower than normal. 

Day 7: (TODAY) - annoyed that I'm still walking slow, still need Tylenol, and can't do certain movements. 😭 Idk why I thought I'd feel all better a week out. Although, I did have my first cup of coffee and nothing bad happened. 

Positive notes: no diarrhea, have started incorporating more low-fat meals with no bad effects. Haven't tried spicy foods yet (I'm Mexican and this pains me, but I wanna go slow). My family has been super supportive, especially hubby. 

Bad parts: pain is the worst to the left of my belly button. I'll ask about it during my post-op appt because it seems much worse than anywhere else, by a few levels. I'm sure it's fine, but I'm paranoid. I'm sleepier than usual. I can do small chores but then I feel like I need to lie down or take a nap. Certain movements still hurt, but I feel I'm improving day by day. 

I work remotely with lots of travel. I took 1 day off and no travel for at least two weeks, but work is pushing me to start scheduling travel starting week 3 post-op. Have to admit I'm looking forward to getting back to ""normal"" but worried about how it'll feel. ",1,1764450975.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Stay :No suit upgrade or 4 PM check out. Got until 2. Understandable as it's a holiday season. Resort is surrounded by many restaurants which is I consider as an excellent location 

Food : meh. Breakfast menu lists lot of items but actual breakfast spread is very small. Omlette station is the only saving grace. Only first day, it was 30$ per person. From second day, they increased it to 35$ which they say they include mimosas and speciality coffee as well. Here is the catch. They skimped on everything. They hardly include 3 or 4 bottles of champagne. If you get there by 9, you are in luck.nif not, you are out of luck. They do not refill them. They simply say ""we are out of it"". Same thing with few special food items. Compared to Tamaya and lost pines, HR coconut point is of no match.

Service: awful service. My wife ordered a non alcoholic drink at the pool. Little did she know about hat it was mixed with seedlip (which tastes like alcohol but does not have alcohol). She requested to remake the drink without it. The waitress came  back and said which I quote ""this is the last free drink I am going to get and I cannot get them anymore"". I had to call her out on this. I will mention this in their review for sure. On the other note, I have also met some excellent staff.

Pools : excellent pool grounds. Always kept clean and had fun tubing.

Overall, I felt like this is definitely not a cat 6 but a cat 5. Have seen much better food and much better service in cat 4 HR's before. If I have to go again, my vote is for lost pines, Austin.


EDIT: people who said its Karen vibes regarding the drink. I STAND MY GROUND. We weren't even rude and kindly requested it. The waitress could have handled this much better. ",0,1764450728.0,hyatt,9,0.5,False

Over the last two years, we’ve been popping up into each others lives every so often, like running into each other every few months, and you could feel the attraction was still there. Ive honestly never felt feelings as strong as the ones for him, and i really believe hes always had strong feelings for me too. When we ended, he stopped talking to me for a few days, and then told me it wasn’t working because he wasn’t in a good place in life for smth serious. Now two years later, we reconnected. I saw one of his friends at a concert and decided to text him and ask if he was there too. He wasn’t, but asked if I wanted to go get coffee, something he hasn’t done in the plenty of other times we’ve reconnected. We texted every day for a few weeks, sometimes he would take awhile to answer, but he’d come back and say hey sorry that was a really busy day. We went out about two weeks ago, and it was really great, it felt like nothing changed. He even told me something really private. Since then we’ve continued texting and all was fine. On Thursday, we discussed doing something this weekend. I asked him if he’d be free on Friday (yesterday) but he said he thought he was doing smth w his friends and asked me if today or Sunday would work instead. I said yes and he said he’d let me know that night. That night he texted me again but it wasn’t telling me his plans, it was just continuing another conversation. I replied to that yesterday morning, and haven’t heard anything since. I can tell that he’s been on his phone cause his snapscore went up once today but I’m not sure about yesterday cause I didn’t check. I probably shouldn’t have, but a couple hours ago I jokingly texted him “are you alive” in hopes he would say yeah sorry just been really busy, but I still haven’t heard anything. I don’t know I really don’t think that he would ghost me, especially given last time, and I know he felt really awful about what happened last time. I’m just super anxious right now and can’t help but think the worst.

1p9zm7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/theotherwoman/comments/1p9zm7l/the_nightmare_that_led_to_me_leaving/,The nightmare that led to me leaving,"This post is going to be a whole mess so please bear with me!!

About a year ago I posted in this thread about the relationship that I (now 26 y/o) was in with MM (now 50 y/o) and how it was causing me to feel the deepest grief and depression. I received loads of kind and supportive comments, for which I feel so grateful, but at the same time I was too deeply bonded and in love to even follow through with the idea of leaving.

This past year, since I published this post, has been hell. I grew even more addicted to that man, even more depressed and withdrawn, and my self esteem was destroyed. I was stuck in a cycle of leaving him, feeling like I was dying, and going back to him the same day. I would break down in tears in front of him and he’d hug me but then ultimately deflect all responsibility and tell me “if this is causing you pain why don’t you just leave? I never promised you a real relationship.”

I have spiralled almost every week, and sent him messages expressing my pain and heartbreak and trying to get him to see the suffering that is inherent in being utterly devoted to someone who wont do the same for you. He always either ignored my messages, accused Me of being on my period, or said something along the lines of “stop writing” or “im Not going to reply to you“ or “we‘ll talk once you’re calm” as though the pain I was in was a symptom of something that had nothing to do with him.

these Past few months, the pain was so bad I started feeling suicidal. I even alluded to this in one of my messages, not as an attempt to manipulate him in any way, but just to get him to see where i was mentally and hopefully show some empathy. I said “you don’t care whether i live or not anyway” to which he said “you’re right, I don’t“. and what did I do? Blame myself for bothering him with thirty messages, and start apologising for being such a nuisance.

following my most recent attempt this week to leave him, only to unblock him after an hour and reach out and say “sorry about this”, he said “I already told you, when you’re like this, either go out for a walk or just dont message me”. He then went on to give a bunch of fake-advice like “you should just try to be more positive“.

previously I would’ve AGREED with him. What was the point of complaining about the relationship when I already knew all the terms and conditions before I entered it? And my depression wasn’t his fault… I just needed more fun and self-care in my life, right?!!! My self esteem had been so eroded that I was literally shrinking myself And using self-blame as a way to avoid feeling my soul’s urge to leave. But that particular day, his smugness pissed me off and it stayed with me. I realised that I wasnt weak for not being able to keep it together within The relationship. I wasn’t just some poor depressed hormonal girl who needed to “work on herself”… turns out that loving someone so intensely is INHERENTLY soul-destroying when that person doesnt you… it didn’t matter how many times he came over and told me he loved me and stared into my soul and Made me feel like we We’re soulmates.

That was all on Thursday. And that night I started journalling and contemplating whether I wanted to stay with him and remain stuck in a permanent state of grief occasionally relieved by his limited affection, or leave him and grieve like hell for a few months and then finally be free? And as I was writing, the tears started rolling. I don’t know how long I cried for, but I was wailing, heaving, choking, reminiscing about every beautiful moment we‘d ever shared. I felt like i was dying. It was one of the most violent nights of tears I’d ever had, and I’ve had many.

I eventually fell asleep, and experienced a nightmare so revolting, so precise, so terrifying that I can’t even call it a nightmare, but rather my psyche slapping me on the face and showing me what i had been refusing to see otherwise.

There were to components to my dream: tbe first was that he Was in my room at my parents house and my Mum had just come back. I told him to get out before he got caught, and he refused to leave and instead wanter to start fixing my air conditioning (??!!). as i Began to hear my mums footsteps down the corridor I he Froze and I told him to get in the wardrobe quickly before he got caught. He did, and I tried to hold it together as I spoke to my mum and tried not to let her see my hands shaking. I knew that I we got caught, it would be hell because my mum knows he’s married.

It’s the second part that messed me up, though. the scene switched to me and my mum in a hotel room, where she thought I had invited her on a girls trip but really I was keeping her because I had hired a hitman to kill her because I wanted her out of the way so that I could be with MM in peace. (JUST TO CLARIFY: I adore my mum and would die for her). As the hours passed I realised that I had made a terrible mistake and a sense of dread began to creep in. I messaged the woman/handler who i had paid to commission the hitman, saying “you can keep my money but you need to cancel this operation. don’t go through with it. I’m begging you” but apparently she wasn’t receiving my messages because she was on a flight.

she eventually replied to coldly repeat the instructions to proceed with the hit: “at 1am youre going to receive a call from the reception desk. The receptionist will ask whether you’d like any coffee. Tell her these exact words: “yes, please send two. I’ll be drinking them with my mum on the balcony”. That’ll initiate the operation. Then, at 2am, the coffees will arrive and the hitman will execute the killing”.

I started shaking as I realised it was too late to cancel… and at that point I woke up.

without even rationalising the dream and it’s symbolism, I FELT the weight of it. I had invested so much time and energy into MM that I had abandoned those who truly love and celebrate me. My mum constantly messages me saying that she misses me, but I’ve been feeling so depressed and obsessed with MM that I’ve avoided her, my dad and everyone who cares abojt me. I’d been self isolating and it wasnt fair… to me and especially to those that needed me. I realised just how much this affair had made me willing to “kill” what truly mattered just to get a brief hit of attention from someone who will never really choose me, no matter how perfect I become for him.

that morning - yesterday- I cancelled all work plans and spent the day with my parents, which felt incredible and I felt this surge of love and grief, like my heart was finally waking up.

i then collapsed in bed and cried myself to sleep yet again, grieving everyrhing… my inability to have him, all the time i had lost, the relationships I had abandoned… and then woke up this morning miserable. spent the entire day crying and debating myself on whether or not I should leave and going through every single thing he’s done and said… and eventually it all just stopped around 3 hours ago. I felt calm. Like I was done crying over him. I wrote him some final messages telling him that I was offended that he couldn’t see how my constant pain was caused by the relationship itself and not my inability to stay positive… that I felt sorry that his wife had to put up with him every single day… that I hoped that one day he’d wake up and realise that he was the problem. I expected no empathy, and he did in fact send me his usual responses (“that’s enough for today“; “I don’t feel like reading the same things over and over again”)

I then blocked him… and I’ve felt weirdly calm. It’s like I had done the majority of processing and crying within the relationship and now that I’m out… I feel calm.

im sure it’s going to hit me later on but I’m determined not to go back.

If you’ve made it to the end… thank you!!! I can’t really talk about this stuff with anyone and thought I’d share because honestly, I thought I was going to be chained to him forever.

1p9zm2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1p9zm2o/my_dad_doesnt_talk_to_me_anymore_and_i_dont_know/,My dad doesn't talk to me anymore and I don't know why.,"**Edit**: Better title, ""I'm grieving my dad but he's still alive"" 

*Before 3 years ago*: My dad was a great father, all things considered. He worked hard to provide for our family. I didn't have a very-close relationship with him, we had our differences and I went to my mom for any emotional support, but we enjoyed playing cribbage together and going to breakfast every Sunday. 

*2 years ago*: my mom moved out, leaving my dad and I in our family house. She and him had a rough marriage from the start. I was still in college at the time, so my dad stayed in the house so my routines could stay as normal as possible. I have adhd and possible autism; change is rough. My partner moved in with us, for me, which helped tremendously. My mom was still in the picture, just living elsewhere in the same city. 

*1 year ago*: my mom and I discovered my dad was doing drugs, after he spent the whole night cleaning under the washer and dryer. I woke up to his beloved coffee maker (it was his late mom's) taken apart in the sink (""to be cleaned""), and the kitchen in disarray with incomplete projects. He said it was a one-time thing, but things didn't get better. I knew he was depressed but no one expected him to get back on heavy drugs; he hadn't done drugs since before I was born, almost 25 years ago. 

I learned recently that he'd vent to my partner frequently about the whole situation with him and my mom, as if she were his therapist, breaking down in tears almost every night I was at work. One night, my partner had a significantly hard day at work and just wanted to be alone and play video games, and my dad got pissed off at her for asking to be alone. He got in her face with anger and aggression (no physical harm), much like I'd seen him do with my mom several times before. My partner urged for us to move out after that, and we signed a lease within the following 2 weeks. 

Come time to move out, my dad wasn't there to help me like he'd promised. He cried as we loaded my bed in his truck, but didn't show up the next day to help me pick up the couch. I'd had it planned with him for weeks leading up to this, and he blamed me for not calling him sooner than I did. Instead, he was helping his friend move into his house to replace my presence. 

*10 months ago*: My dad got physical towards my mom after she discovered more drugs in the house. He pushed her, yelling at her, and caused a bruise. My mom called me crying while I was at work. I had a breakdown (reasonably so), and begged her for divorce him. I yelled at my dad for what he did, and he told me to stop associating with him. I thought this was just drug talk. Mom contacted an attorney the same day and finalized the divorce the same month. 

*8 months ago*: Unrelated to the rest of the post, I officially started transitioning (ftm) 251 days ago. Despite the situation, my mental health significantly improved and my anxiety and depression reduced to nearly nothing. My body and mind have a more-manageable response to stress. Everything is fantastic in that regard. My dad seemed to have a supportive reaction, and my mom is supportive in her own way. 

*4 months ago*: Mom and dad sold the house. He moved in with some of his cousins temporarily, going as fsr as promising CPS to help take care of their kids so they didn't get taken away. He didn't stick around. He gave me $10k of the $100,000 he got from the house, as well as paying back the $16k debt he'd acquired from his cousins. 

*3 months ago*: My dad moved to Texas with a woman he barely knows. He told me she was his perfect match. Funny thing about the first 3 months is, that's what psychologists call the ""honeymoon phase""; it's pretty and perfect until the end of the 3 months, and that's when the real relationship starts. 

*1 month ago*: He called me asking for $2000 to come back to Reno. I'm the main money-maker in my household and stress about money pretty often. I told him I didn't have the money (I did, but it's my safety-net savings incase of anything), but to let me know when he was in town. He never let me know, instead showing up to my mom's house unannounced to see the family dog. He never once contacted me while he was in town, never once replied to the messages I sent in attempt to reach out. He didn't reply until he was headed back to Texas. A week later, he drunk-called me (drunk driving), complained that all his friends and family turned their backs on him. I tried to ask him why he never messaged me while he was in town. He said he did. I asked why he didn't try to see me. He didn't answer, just changed the subject. Said I'm not better than the others, because I also didn't help him. I said I might have, if he made an effort to see me. He shit-talked my mom, saying she's ""always been a piece of shit""; I defended her. It ended with him saying ""this is the last conversation you'll have with me"", and I hung up on him. 

*Now*: He asked me again for money, this time asking $600 and promising to give me back half of it ($300) when he got into town. I told him I couldn't do $600 but I could do $200. My logic here was, if he doesn't pay me back, I can safely miss $200 without messing with my finances; and if he can pay me back $300, he should be able to pay back $200 no problem. 

He'd given a vague apology (""I'm sorry for whatever happened"") but said he didn't remember what happened the last talk we had. I reminded him, expecting a better apology, but nothing. He only cared about the money. 

That was Friday, November 21st. He hasn't messaged me since. I texted him on thanksgiving, saying I loved him and wished him a happy Thanksgiving-- he's read it, but no response. 

Being on T now, my feelings are different. I feel myself caring but I don't. I feel myself being sad but I'm not. Frankly, I'm happy he's not in my life, considering the state he's in. I don't need that around me. But I never expected him to go down the path he did. I never expected to be in adulthood without my dad. I never expected to have had to move out of my childhood house under the circumstances that had happened. 

And now, I'm having to accept the fact that he'll never be the dad I had anymore. I'm grieving the loss of a man that is still alive; I'm grieving the character loss of the dad I once had. ",3,1764449860.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

Hint no 01:  
At hospital where Mike and Nancy are in waiting area Mikes goes to get Coffee and on his way back sees a book named ""**A wrinkle in time""**  
Hint no 02:  
In the **WSQK** where Robin, Will and Joyce are waiting and then robin says to Joyce since when did this red light was on and Robin says some thing about flux capacitor

Now what this has to do with with time travel  
**No 01:**  
The book A wrinkle in time is about a girl named **Meg Murry**, her little genius brother **Charles Wallace** and their friend **Calvin** this book story revolved around find their dad in another time line or another dimension and they travel their by using a method similar to worm holes  and you know Mr. Clarke was also teaching about worm holes.  
**No 02:**  
Next the Flux capacitor this is actually a fiction technology used in time travel or for traveling in different dimensions .

so I think we are gonna see worm holes which will lead us to holly and max in henry/Vecna/001/Mr. Whatsit.

Our load was from Carson CA to Bensenville, IL. Picked up in CA on Monday and load due in IL Wednesday morning. We knew we were going to be driving into some bad weather, but we've spent whole winters in the NE and been in lots of snow and ice. Six years experience, each. My co-driver, Preston and I were well prepared, extra water, extra food, warm clothes, truck just fully serviced. We're good to go. We thought we'd beat the worst of it and make it to Chicago. Worst case we'd lay over in a hotel once we got there and wait for conditions to improve.



I drive days and Preston drives nights. We switched shifts in St Robert MO. It had been raining since about Tulsa and the temperature had been steadily dropping, but still in the 40's. Watching the radar closely and saw the snow bands coming but still thought we could make it to Chicago before the worst of the storm hit.



Just north of Bloomington IL, things go from meh to terrible in just a few miles. Preston started seeing jackknifed trucks everywhere. He's driving about 15-20 mph and it's still really sketchy. He decided he needed to get off the road. The Limestone Rest Area is 30 miles ahead and he decides that's where he's going to stop. Even that distance, took several hours, but he made it safely and parks on the shoulder at the rest area entrance. We're good.


I hadn't slept very well even though I trust Preston's driving ability 100%, I knew what was ahead and how things can go south in a second, so I was up at about 0630 (normally 0800). I get up and come out of the sleeper and it's bad. Really bad. Really windy, blowing snow, truck is covered in ice. Preston is telling me how bad it was and I thank him for getting us safely off the road. What little traffic is still on I-55 is crawling. Shortly after, the state police close the interstate.


We're good though, more than a quarter tank of fuel, plenty of food and water, safely off the road. That quarter tank will easily last 50-60 hours at idle. It is what it is, but we're safe and warm.


These trucks at idle will build up soot in the diesel exhaust filter. After about 6-8 hours of idling they will run an automatic ""re-gen"" where the diesel engine runs up the idle and burns off the soot. So it starts it's re-gen, which is no big deal. Normally.


About 15 minutes into the re-gen, alarms start going off. WTF? Low coolant alarm, overheat warning, engine shutdown warning. This isn't good. I think, eh, the grill probably has snow and ice blocking the airflow, probably not that bad. I get out to look and I see the bright red all over what snow hadn't been melted by the hot coolant, there's coolant all over the ground. This is bad.


I take a look under the truck and under the hood, trying to determine where the leak is. Hoping maybe because it overheated, it just blew off some coolant. We'll add some and perhaps we'll be good. So we add coolant and start the truck back up. All the alarms are cleared, maybe we're okay. I get out to look and there's a steady stream of coolant coming out from right below the radiator. Maybe it is just a hose. By the time I get back in the truck all the alarms are going off again.


Now we keep tons of stuff in the truck to make at least temporary repairs so we can get back on the road. If it's just a hose or a broken clamp or something, we can fix it. Then I think, if it's not something simple and I get down in the snow and get wet and colder and I can't fix it, at least temporarily, now I'm colder and wetter and we have no heat in the truck. Probably better not risk it. That turns out to be a great decision.


We start calling for roadside assistance and or a tow. We also call back to our shop in CA, hoping they can find someone to assist as our prospects are pretty bleak. Best case was 24 hours, mostly I'm told we can't even put you on a waiting list. Starting to look serious rather than just inconvenient. California calls back, ""got a wrecker coming for you, ETA 90 minutes"". That's amazing, thanks for the help, I owe you a twelve pack!


Several hours go by, it's down to about 45 degrees in the truck. I call the wrecker company for an update. State Police are commandeering wreckers to try to clear the road. We're working our way towards you but still over 20 miles away and there's trucks crashed and jackknifed everywhere. Currently no ETA. This sucks. The wrecker company dispatch tells me that we're at the worst rest area in the state and that there's no facilities. We're parked too far away to even see if there's a building or not. Google Maps shows there's a building. But the dispatcher is local, surely he would know. What if we walk the nearly ½ mile to the building and it's closed? Or not heated? If we expend all the energy, get colder and wetter walking over there and have to walk back, we're screwed. We'll wait.


A couple more hours go by, down to 35 degrees in the truck. We're bundled up but still cold. Can't run the truck even briefly. This is really bad.


About another hour goes by and we both, within about 5 minutes of each other, start uncontrollably shivering. We have to do something. We're about 5 miles south of Pontiac IL. Out of extreme positive thinking, I try Uber and Lyft both, yeah, that's not going to happen. I Google taxi's, yeah, no. I try the CB radio for 20 minutes. No one even answers. I call the Pontiac police department and explain our situation. No, we're overwhelmed, try the State Police. I do, ""sorry, nothing we can do, you're at a rest area, shelter inside the building.""

We gather up some supplies, I put plastic bags over my shoes to keep them dry, Preston has waterproof hiking boots on. We're good. We set out for the rest area building and warm shelter. We hope.

I don't want to sound overly dramatic, but this is my recollection...

Now Preston is 30 years old and in decent shape. I'm 63, sadly a smoker and have put on far too much weight in 6 years of being on the road. But it's less than half a mile. I didn't even think about it, other than it's going to be cold. I might add here we live in Arizona, other than getting out to fuel or drop a trailer or the few other things we have to do when we're in cold weather, we don't really do cold. We're acclimated to the desert.

About half way to the building, I realize I may be in trouble. The snow is shin deep, it's like 10 degrees. I'm already having trouble taking deep breaths because of the cold air. I ask Preston to slow down some, which he doesn't want to do, but thankfully he does. We keep walking, my chest starts hurting, I think to myself, not like heart attack pain, it's just because of the cold air. The building, shelter, is about another 100 yards. I got this.

That last 100 yards was surreal, I don't want to say I saw my life flash before my eyes, but it was terrifying. I had to stop, I told him, ""I don't think I'm going to make it"". He was like ""whatever dude, it's right there."" I felt like I was going to collapse. There's only a few times in my 63 years I can remember real fear. This was the top one. I prayed over the last 50 yards.

Finally, inside, a coffee vending machine, something hot to drink. The best coffee I ever had in my life! It took me an hour to recover. I was embarrassed, how could I almost not be able to walk a ½ mile? I made a commitment to lose weight, excercise more and quit smoking.

It took about 8 hours more for the wrecker to reach us. We got up to Batavia IL and a hotel finally at 0400. I passed out.

Turns out it was the radiator, it had developed a leak. The next day we were back on the road.

1p9zf7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1p9zf7d/was_it_my_diet/,Was it my diet,"It started around 2003, my weight loss journey along with the breakdown of cartilage in my body. 

I was bouncing on our trampoline for exercise and tore the meniscus on the inside of both of my knees. A sports medicine doctor repaired my left knee by shaving the meniscus down so I could walk again but no more sitting with my legs crossed in front of me. My right knee healed on its own. Took a year b4 I could walk without a limp. Then it was my stomach, always in knots. I felt it in my vocal chords when I tried singing in my car, found out I had GERD so I used tums when I went to bed and that seemed to help a little. There were times when we went to my son’s wrestling matches I would walk out to the car and lie down in the back seat doubled up in absolute pain. I just knew I had stomach cancer or an ulcer. 

Next were my shoulders, supraspinatus tendon was fraying and causing pain, I swam laps in the pool quite often and for an hour at a time. I had my second Orthoscopic surgery, took 8 months to heal enough to get back into the pool. My right shoulder was next, I threw a rock to skip it across a body of water and felt something tear then a few months later tried throwing a football on the beach and finished the tear in my rotator cuff requiring my third orthoscopic procedure to repair. Then I injured my heal jumping in the pool, I was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis!  I loved walking for exercise but every step was agonizing. I was still having sever stomach pain and couldn’t seem to figure out what was causing all of this. On top of this I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. I was an absolute mess , I thought I was doing everything right in order to lose weight and get in shape but I couldn’t shake the injuries and my stomach was killing me. 

I started looking at my diet as a cause of my elevated blood pressure requiring water pills, stomach pain and my obvious problem with connective tissue. Some of the things I ate and drank almost every day. 

I would drink 4 cups of coffee throughout the morning. I sometimes made breakfast but not very often. For lunch I would eat a large tomato salad with vinegar and oil and a good amount of hot sauce. Loved my sunflower seeds throughout the day at work, because they were supposed to be a healthy snack. When I drank with my wife we would drink gin and tonic’s, I made sure to add mustard to just about every meat I ate. Loved V8 juice, at least a gallon a week, sometimes more. Pickles and relish were an almost daily treat as well. Loved pickle ice. We also ate plenty of fast foods and other restaurants food, plenty of salty snacks too.

Needless to say I not only included a lot of acid based foods and drinks, it was also loaded in sodium. It hit me like a ton of bricks, I no kidding took a heaping tablespoon of baking soda and mixed it with water and drank it down. I bought a bunch of yogurt and cut out sunflower seeds and all salted things. I also stopped eating anything with vinegar. After a couple days I started feeling better, first in my stomach. I could actually relax my stomach and it wasn’t causing me to take tums before bed time. A couple weeks later and my plantar fasciitis started healing. A month later and I forgot how badly my stomach used to feel and my foot stopped hurting all together. I checked my blood pressure and it was very close to normal. I made other changes in the amount of sodium I consumed and by the end of my second month I no longer needed water pills. I eat a balance regimen fruit and vegetables and meat, making sure I don’t eat too much of anything that would cause me any other problems. I am able to lose weight, workout, swim, bike and walk/jog and I do some sort of exercise not only for major muscle groups but I really work my heart too. I now only take vitamin D and magnesium. My blood pressure goes up when I eat a little too much salt but I keep it in check. ",5,1764449362.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I like the idea of just visiting coffee shops and local restaurants and maybe picking up a trinket, doodad, or bauble here and there. Aside from that I'd just be walking around, reading or something as that's what I usually do with my time.

It sounds fun and relaxing on paper, but I feel like taking such a laissez-faire attitude to international travel is a recipe for disappointment. Maybe I'm thinking too hard about it.

The pod machine that my fiance and I bought from Aldi nearly 10 years ago appears to be on its way out and we've got more disposable income now so we're thinking it might be time for an upgrade.

I like the idea of eventually modding the machine, but we have a 2 year old and a 2 month old so free time for these kinds of things at the moment are very limited so it would need to be decent with no changes to it. I think the absolute max I'd be willing to spend is 1.5k AUD for the machine. A grinder would be nice as well for that price, but we can get coffee ground for us from local cafes if need be.

I'm not sure if this is something to shop for but ease for use would be the other thing that would be great. I know my partner will get frustrated if they have to stand there with a timer and a thermometer and if things go a few seconds or degrees out the coffee tastes like ass. We're not expecting to press a button and walk away, but yeah, passable coffee without a doing months of experimentation.

Today out of curiosity for a cheap car heater I go on FB marketplace. I came across an ad for free Thanksgiving leftovers not far from me (20 min).
On my way there and the person texts back asking if I want coffee too. I reply yes and show up 15 minutes later.
On the porch is a hot cup of coffee and enough leftovers for 2 meals. Turkey, mashed potatoes with gravy, green bean casserole, stuffing and raspberry pie. 
I am so thankful for this meal. It's the best thing I've eaten in over 6 months. Absolutely delicious.

1p9yy6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1p9yy6a/i_know_i_did_the_right_thing_by_cutting_all_three/,"I know I did the right thing by cutting all three of my parents out of my life, but need to vent.","This will be very long, just a warning. To start, I want to say that despite everything my parents have done, I do love them and wish that we could have a relationship but based off the fact that I have tried for YEARS to make it work, none of my parents are capable of admitting fault, respecting boundaries or adjusting their behavior. I also want to admit that I was not perfect either. When I lived with them periodically as a young adult, like 20s I would steal their weed and alcohol. I have since stopped drinking alcohol, made amends to them, and paid them back. I say this for honesty and transparency and I only recently cut them off. I'm 38 and have not since repeated my negative behavior with them. My birth mom has told me that when I was born, she ‘knew I was a little mother’. My mom and dad are both practicing alcoholics and drug addicts. Once they had my younger brother and sister, my mom still had this weird delusion that I was their mother, and at times I felt like she also considered me her mother in a sense. I do want to mention that she was sexually abused by her father and not believed/gaslight by her mother about the situation. I know she, along with my other parents, had a very rough childhood. However, that did not give them the right to take it out on me. Anyway, I distinctly remember her being gone for days and would lock herself in her room all day. That would leave be at 5, 6 and 7 years old to care for my 18 month younger sister and my brother, who was actually a baby. So, I would change his diapers, get both of them dressed make them breakfast and get them off to the bus stop for school. I would also cover their ears and sing to them when my mom and dad, or other men, would literally fist fight. They would both get drunk, start a fight, my mom would tell him to hit her, then was a victim when he did. He would cheat on her and hit her unprovoked too. I felt responsible to protect my siblings. I also want to mention that I don't remember taking care of them when I was really young, my sister told me. My brain obviously blocked out the trauma. But I do remember caring for them and protecting them around 9 or 10. This would include taking them on walks when they would fight and such. I also called the police on my dad multiple times. My parents had divorced when I was 5 and me caring for their basic needs started happening after that, when we lived with her as a single mom. My dad remarried. My stepmother did ‘give me back my childhood’ by being the parent and letting me be a kid, which i will always be grateful for. She was toxic However. For example, she would say horrible things to my dad, emasculating vindictive things. He was always drunk, I'm talking whiskey in his coffee, then his Gatorade at his construction job. After she would say these horrible things, which were either triggered by his immense immaturity, his drinking or the fact that he cheated on her, he would then beat her up and/or rape her. I would call the cops, he would sometimes go to jail, but she would always take him back. She was also WILDLY strict. I'm all for kids doing chores and being respectful, but we would spend 2 hours cleaning incessantly every day, and, for example, if we accidentally left a sock on the floor she would thrn scream at us for an hour. She had the need to control everything in her life and because she couldn't control ger alcoholic violent cheating bastard of a husband, she chose to take out all her control issues on us. I have always been a bigger woman, so she would constantly berated be for my weight. She would also do things like insult my looks, my dreams, things I was good at disguised as ‘constructive criticism’. What wad really going on was i was obviously younger, but also much prettier than her despite my weight, and she was/is the type of person that acts on her jealousy by attempting to tear others woman down instead of building them up because she wants what they have. I want to mention here that there is nothing wrong with being a bit jealous, what is wrong is attempting to mess with the person's self esteem, confidence and even trying to keep them from being more successful. I cannot stand people like that. She would also treat me differently when in front of men. She respects men, and not women, they are just competition to her. Anyway, so you are probably starting to see my reasoning for cutting them off. I also want to mention that my father is my grandma's only son and therefore can do no wrong. My grandma has always enabled his behavior, which is probably based in the face that my grandpa was a psycho and would beat him for small things, and he cheated on my grandma for most of their marriage with multiple woman. (He was the head of the agricultural department at a junior college and would use his status to sleep with his young female students. At one point he even gave some woman $15,000 then lied and said someone stole it, he didn’t know who, and even got the police involved). My grandpa did teach me some things about work ethic and respect that are invaluable to my life now, and he did help the environment and was a respected man in his field. He was a much better grandpa then father or husband. But, at one time he used my mental illness as a way to try and cover up his affairs while also trying to get me to join the military as a way to make me go away because he ‘knew I knew’. I also found out that he did the same thing with his own elderly mother, blaming her schizophrenia on why she saw him with other women. But he was still a better role model than my parents. (I'm aware this sounds insane, but I really had some crazy toxic adults in my life lol). There is a whole lot more to unpack there, but in the interest of time, I'll move on. Anyway, I kept my stepmother in my life until she in addition to criticize my weight, she started criticizing my younger daughters weight. I warned her twice to stop, but she didn’t, so I cut her off. I remember at one point sometime before that I was offered a professional singing job in a jazz orchestra and she said something along the lines of, how could you leave your husband on the weekends to take care of your girls and your girls should have their mother at home. It wasn’t obvious then, because I was used to and unaware of her tactics that she was just jealous and did not want me to have that kind of success. Anyway, back to my dad. He has always done and said whatever he wanted and wasn't told no or been made accountable by his mother, so he continued his ridiculous behavior. She would bail him out of jail, pay for rehab,etc. My dad has continued to emotionally and physically abuse his grown children (he slapped my sister once for calling out some of his atrocious behavior) when hammered, which was most days, he would project his hate for himself on us, like screaming I'm not a piece of shit, you are. And are you loosing it? And such over and over, like how drunk people repeat things and don't hear you. He also beat his third wife, made her keep it a secret, but we knew. His third wife had her problems, (anyone that would stay with a man like my father obviously would) but she was actually a very kind, good women, whom my father definitely did not deserve. They had been together 20 years when she got an incurable disease that would steadily cause her to become entombed in her body, then she would pass away. Very soon after this, when my father realized that she couldn't have sex with her anymore, he asked for an open relationship, she refused (that's not who she was) he decided to DIVORCE her. He tried to use the excuse that getting divorced would end up with her receiving better medical care, which i understand, but that is not why he divorced her. He through away 20 years of marriage to a beautiful wonderful woman that was actually going to die in 2 years, which he knew, because he didn't want to go without sex and because he didn't want to take care of her. Keep in mind, she worked full time, did all the cleaning and ‘kept him satisfied’ for TWENTY YEARS and he couldn't take a cold shower or downtown Lester brown for 2 years. Selfish motherfucker. There are about a million other deplorable things this man has done but I dont have time to list them. Like he called my brothers wife a pussy for not breastfeeding. My brother did choke him out, which was so enjoyable, especially since my dad used to beat my brother incessantly and it was the first time my brother was able to fight back. I still feel so satisfied when I think about it. Also, the last time I saw my dad (which was actually after I tried and almost succeeded at unaliving myself, I was in avoma for 10 days. And what's interesting is both my birth parents just had to see me, I would assume they blamed themselves a little) he wanted to pay for dinner and a movie for everyone but the timing didn't allow. Instead of adapting, he through a toddler temper tantrum by saying if we can't go to the movies he wouldn't pay for anything (which i didn't care about) but he also refused to talk to any of use and just stubbornly sat there. My sister had come with him, whom I adore, and we just continued enjoying our visit. Let the big baby have his tantrum. My dad has known for several years now that I will not take any of his shit, the gaslighting, abuse and outright selfishness, so he doesn't mess with me, however anyti.ei would stand up to him, call him out or whatever, he would ‘take it out’ on my siblings, not directly talking about me, just being a general drunk violent asshole to them. He would also try to ‘get to me’ through my grandma, then she would try and convince me to come back, like ‘your dad has such a hard time’ and ‘but he's your dad, and he loves you’ pretty much saying, he's your dad and he has a right to you, and you just have to accept him for who he is. I love my grandma very much, but she has problems too,like everybody else. For some reason, all ‘three’ of my parents have believed that they dont have to be accountable for their own actions, don't have to respect boundaries, and are entitled to me being around to make them feel better about themselves. I have been their emotional punching bag/hostage and they believe that all of this is ok simply because birthed me. This is not the case. So, once my sister told me she was done, cut of my dad, I sent him this message, then blocked him-

I want you to stop trying to contact you. I never want to see you or talk to you again. I'm sure you can imagine all the reasons why. And do NOT take this out on my siblings or try and use grandma to get to me- she does not need that. (Side note, my grandma has dementia). Now LEAVE ME ALONE. You do not deserve to be in my life, and I have no need for you. You're a monster.

He has left me alone since then. Now, for my birth mother and why we're done. In addition to the things you already know, she also left us with I developmentally disabled woman as a babysitter who would give me food and put me in front of the TV while she did things with my sister in her room. There was another ti.e when I was 10 or 11 and she attempted to ‘sell me’ to a 19 year old man ‘temporarily’ for drugs. Recently, my husband and I were dealing with a lying manipulating landlord and we have a few days to find somewhere to live with our two teenage girls. At that time I had put the past behind me and was trying to hold onto the last parent in my life. Things were OK for a few days, but my mom drinks all day everyday, and her view of reality is heavily skewed even without adding alcohol to the mix. She's one of those people that makes every single conversation about her, even if she has nothing to do with it. Like say, I would come to her sad about something, she would find a way to make what I said a personal attack against her. She would say something around the house was fine, but by 1 pm that same day it definitely wasn't fine, and then she would explain all the reasons why, which rarely made sense. Or if her concern was legitimate, I would apologize and attempt to correct the problem she had either with me, the kids or my husband (apparently every one of their actions she didn't like was MY responsibility and MY fault). I tried so hard all day everyday to be respectful of her and her needs/wants at all times because it was her house and I was grateful for her help. She would just do a dr jackal and Mr hyde everyday about countless things. She would assume something i did or sa8d was always an attack pointed directly at her and I was ‘disrespectful’ if I expressed how I felt attacked. If I tried to set any boundaries at all either her, I was ‘disrespectful’. Like, if you're really drunk, please dont go into the girls room because it makes them uncomfortable. She would also touch them, not in inappropriate places, but just how she would when she was drunk made them uncomfortable. She would also do things like ‘poke by bumhole’ when I would turn over, which made me very uncomfortable. There were so many times that she would say things like, do you talk to your friends or your sponsor about me? What do you say? I would say I'm not going to talk about that, then I was ‘disrespectful’. She only wants people around her she can control and manipulate. She also slings backhanded compliments/insults to anyone that is getting more attention than her, either good or bad. And she thinks she's bring sneaky about it but it's BLARINGLY obvious. She also expects apologies all the time, but she's NEVER in the wrong and never apologizes, unless as a last ditch manipulation tactic. She thinks that because she's my mom ill never cut her off. She was wrong. She drank beer all day everyday starting at 8am but all she really wanted was vodka. I believe that she would start fights in orderyo ensure an excuse to go outabd buy vodka to drink. She did things like roll around on the floor drunk in front of my children, scream horrible things to her husband (he's not exactly a barrel of kittens either) make every single conversation an argument. I can't even listening them all. She's just exhausting. I do want to mention here that when I was 18 and her husband was 38 or 39 he got me drunk and convinced me to sleep with him. I was in the wrong too, but he was the one who pursued. She of course blamed the whole thing on me, and still does to this day. It has been her favorite go to to bring up when I call her out with damping evidence as a way to escape any accountability. She also abandoned us when I was 11, my sister and brother younger, with the excuse of being afraid my dad would kill her. According to her it was a sacrifice foe us to have a better life and she has been martyr about it ever since. I have asked fir two apologies from her, only two. The first was because I asked her to apologize for abandoning us. She said it was my dad's fault and you ask him for an apology. The most recent apology i asked for resulted in me cutting her off. She had not been feeling good when we moved out, so I texted her the next day asking how she was feeling. No reply. Then, I asked her again a couple of days later, no reply. Then, we all got Covid and were sick, which she knew. About a week after that, she called me. Not to ask how her sick grandchildren were, but yo tell me that she feels ‘disrespected and unloved’ by me because I didn't call ir text to check on her. Which i did, actually. I even sent her screen shots of me asking her twice how she was feeling. Her next tactic was to say you never told us, apologized or payed for the hole in the wall we accidentally made. In fact, I did talk to her and her husband about it, apologizing,  offered to to fix it, and offered $100 to fix it. They said, pay it when you can. Then we all got covid. So she said, just apologize for the hole. (Which i already did) but I apologized again anyway. I then asked her to apologize for assuming I didn't care about her, hence the screenshot, but her reply was the nail in our relationship coffin. She said, you should ask your dad for your apology. I knew then that this woman was permanently mentally inept to maintain a rational adult relationship. This whole thing actually fucking sucks because even though my brain tells me I am not responsible for their emotional happiness, self worth etc, my nervous system tells me I am. These are life long emotional manipulative abusive tactics to tell me that I have to fit in the box they made for me. But I don't. All they did was be the physical body that my real father, God used to bring me here. I'm not religious, but spiritual. They say religious people look forward to heaven, but spiritual people have already experienced hell. I will always be sad about this and will always love my parents, but no good comes from having my parents in my life, and it never will. I can accept that and be so grateful every day that my children know what unconditional love truly is. And my husband shows me the same. I am a strong ass woman. I am also very excited right now because my husband and I write music and I have been offered a paying gig to sing our original songs. My future looks bright and I no longer listen to the inner voices they put in my head. Now, I listen to God's.

1p9yv3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1p9yv3w/iso_link_for_alphas_forgotten_mate_please/,"ISO link for Alpha’s Forgotten Mate, please!","I froze in front of the black SUV.

My breath caught as the heavy scent of sex filled the air. I recognized it instantly—Kane's. That familiar, woody musk I had breathed in for five years. My mate's scent... now twisted, tainted, unrecognizable.

""Kane, don't stop!""

A woman's voice trembled from inside— breathless, soaked in pleasure. My heart lurched violently. The sound-and her scent—were far too familiar for me to make mistakes.

Elsa. The elder's daughter.

She was the one fooling around with Kane— my mate.

""Beg me, dear,"" my mate's low growl came, thick with amusement and desire.

Through the half-open door, 1 saw his lips devouring Elsa's. One of his hands gripped her thigh possessively, the other tugged at her underwear as she moaned beneath him.

Then I saw it.

A diamond necklace glinting against her throat — my necklace. The one with my name engraved on it.

My breath hitched painfully. That necklace had been custom-made by the pack's master jeweler.

Kane had searched the entire territory for the perfect gem, saying it reminded him of my eyes.

I'd lost it six months ago and searched everywhere for it.

Now... it hung around her neck.

Time stopped. I could hardly breathe.

I tried to turn away, but my feet felt rooted to the ground. 

""How do you compare me to your Luna?"" Elsa asked, her voice teasing.

""Do I even need to ask?"" Kane's lips curved into a smirk. ""You're far more... captivating than she is.""

His kiss was deep, possessive, and laced with promise.

""I prefer your softness... every inch of you,"" he murmured, drawing her closer, his desire evident in every motion.

Elsa's breath came fast, the air between them thick with tension. Then, without warning, Kane tore the necklace from her neck and hurled it out the window.

His laugh followedlow, sharp, and merciless.

""Go to hell,"" he said coldly. ""That scent never suited you anyway.""

She laughed, breathless and proud, tilting her head toward the dim glow of the dashboard lights.

""So... when will you claim me as your Luna?"" Elsa asked, her words heavy with desire.

Kane's smirk deepened. ""Do you really think this compares to being my Luna?""

Then he moved against her again, each motion deliberate, decadent, echoing through the car like the sound of betrayal itself.

In that instant, everything inside me shattered.

I didn't know how long this had been going on how long Kane had been betraying me behind my back.

If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes tonight, I would still be living in that beautiful lie, believing my mate loved me as fiercely as I loved him.

Maxine, my wolf, howled inside my head —her sorrow tearing through every corner of my soul.

Kane and I bonded five years ago.

We met at university, fated mates. After the bonding ceremony, lite had been pertector at least, I thought so. He had been gentle, patient, attentive. Every morning, he didn't ask the omegas to make breakfast for me. Instead, he'd wake early to make me sandwiches and coffee, humming softly as he buttered the bread, smiling whenever he caught me watching.

He never raised his voice—not even once.

He was the perfect mate in everyone's eyes.

And I... I believed in him completely.

It was his birthday today.

I had spent the entire day preparing a surprise his favorite meal, the decorations, every little detail.

But as night fell, he mindlinked me, saying something urgent had come up with the pack and he'd be home late.

When I noticed the candles were burning low, I decided to drive to the market to buy more-just in case Kane came home earlier than expected.

But the truth waiting for me... was nothing I could have imagined.

""Quite a show, isn't it? You've been standing here for ten minutes.""

The voice came from behind-low, magnetic, dangerous.

I froze. 

His scent reached me next—wild mountain air, sharp and primal. It sliced through the heavy night, pulling me out of the fog I'd fallen into.

I didn't turn around. I didn't have the strength—or the emotion-to care.

""I feel more like throwing up,"" I murmured softly, my tone calm. Too calm.

He chuckled, low and dark. ""Seems you were watching very closely.""

My lips twitched. ""Yes... when your mate is with someone else, 1 guess you notice things even more carefully than I do.”

I turned away, leaving him standing there, his expression complicated—but I didn't care.

Inside my car, I closed the door and whispered to Maxine, ""Should we end the bond?""

My wolf didn't answer—but I could feel her sorrow, deep and heavy, echoing through my chest.

A bitter smile curved on my lips as I started the engine.

I didn't sleep that night. My mind kept circling the same question—should I end our bond now?

It was well past midnight when Kane came home.

Even half-asleep, I could smell her scent— Elsa's scent— still clinging to his body. 

When he lay down beside me, 1 could feel his large hand sliding around my waist, touching me gently.

""Sherry,"" his warm touch sent a shiver through my body, making me stiff.

""Did you miss me?"" His voice was low, laced with desire as he tried to unfasten my coat.

""Sorry for missing my birthday..."" he whispered, pressing his lips to my ear.

""I'll make it up to you now.""

He leaned closer, moving forward-but I stopped him, turning away.

""I'm exhausted. Go to sleep,"" I said.

He didn't insist, only heading to the bathroom.

As the water ran, I shifted and caught a whitf of that scent-another she-wolf's scent lingering on his coat.

A wave of disgust rolled through me.

The next day was the Full Moon.

That night was the pack's sacred Night Run-a tradition every Alpha and Luna were meant to lead together.

But, unsurprisingly, Kane wouldn't be attending.

He had another ""border negotiation"" with the most promising healer in my pack.

I couldn't help but scoff silently—there was no point in comparing myself to her.

Yet, despite knowing his betrayal, my wolf still ached.

Even after everything he had done, a part of me couldn't bring myself to leave him.

As Luna of the pack, I would shoulder the responsibility of organizing it for him—at least as long as the bond between us remained unbroken.

So when the full moon rose, I shifted and led them through the forest.

My wolf surged with energy, moving faster than ever, howling into the night as if she wanted to release all the frustration and pain trapped in her heart.

When the run ended and laughter filled the clearing, I slipped away toward the rest lodge nearby, needing air-needing silence.

But as I drew closer, Maxine stirred uneasily inside me. Her fur bristled, a low growl vibrating in my chest.

That scent.

My blood ran cold—it was the same one.

A low, breathless sound came from behind the half-closed door. My pulse spiked. I wanted to turn away, but Maxine's instinct screamed no.

So I didn't flinch.

I pushed the door open.

A startled voice followed, laced with anger and panic.

""Who dares open the door?""

""Sorry to disturb you,"" I said evenly. ""I must've taken a wrong turn.""

The moment Kane heard my voice, he froze, panic and disbelief flashing across his eyes.

""Sh... Sherry?""

My heart clenched when I saw them—two wolves tangled together-but the pain quickly settled into a cold, heavy numbness.

""Sherry, don't misunderstand,"" Kane stammered, hastily buttoning his shirt. ""I was injured, and Elsa just brought me here to tend to the wound. Besides, you know she's the pack's most promising healer... and I'm her Alpha.""

Elsa rose gracefully from his lap, her lips curling into a taunting smile.

""Oh, it's Luna Sherry,"" she said, her tone dripping with mockery. ""Please, make yourself comfortable.""

Her pale skin glimmered under the dim light, her curves just enough to remind me why Kane was so addicted to her.

""You know my purpose,"" Elsa said, smiling innocently. ""What I do best is making my Alpha comfortable.""

Her words should have angered me, should have made me cry-but I didn't.

Back then, I would have lost myself in rage, but now. I simply didn't care about Kane anymore.

""Elsa, don't be ridiculous,"" Kane said calmly.

He hurriedly stood, straightening his shirt.

""Don't mind her, Sherry. Elsa has no mate of her own, so she always makes these... inappropriate jokes.""

""Anyway,"" I said coolly. ""I should get back to the pack. After all, they still think their Alpha is busy handling the 'border issues.’”

I smiled faintly, but it never reached my eyes.

Before I could leave, Kane grabbed my wrist.

Guilty flickered in his eyes.

""Sherry, about the border issue. I can explain.  Please, let's go home and talk, okay?""

But before 1 could respond, another voice chimed sweetly from behind him.

""Alpha Kane, you promised to take me to see the fireworks later.""

I yanked my hand free, gave him one last look, and walked away.

Sherry, it's time to end the bond.

Maxine's voice echoed in my mind.

I didn't answer her—because after what I'd just seen, I could feel it too. The bond was already breaking.
When I got home, Kane was there, waiting.

A bouquet of fresh flowers sat on the tablethe kind he used to buy me when we first met.

""Sherry, why did you come home so late? You have no idea how worried I was about you!""

He rushed toward me, arms open, lips ready to press against mine. I turned away before he could touch me.

""Sherry... are you still upset about Elsa?"" he asked carefully, his tone dripping with fake concern.

""Don't take it so seriously,"" he added, stepping closer. ""She's just a healer, but you—"" his fingers brushed my cheek, ""you're different. You're my mate, my Luna.""

Then he pulled out a small velvet box and opened it, revealing a necklace that sparkled under the light.

""Are you still looking for that necklace?""

As he spoke, Kane took out the necklace and clasped it around my neck himself.

""I bought a new one for you,"" he said softly.

""Lookhow perfect it looks on you.""
I didn't respond. My fingers brushed the pendant once before 1 quietly removed it and set it aside.

""Sherry, I know you're still angry,"" he said quickly, stepping closer. ""Elsa and I have known each other since we were kids. We're... comfortable with each other—maybe too comfortable. I didn't think about how it might look.""

Comfortable.

The word echoed bitterly in my mind. Is that what he called it—pressing his lips to her skin, touching her like she was something fragile and precious!

""You know how she is,"" Kane went on, his tone growing more desperate. ""She's always been... affectionate. It doesn't mean anything, Sherry. You have to believe me.""

I reached the top of the stairs and finally turned to face him. His green eyes—the same eyes that had once made me feel like the only woman in the world-now looked foreign to me. How long had he been lying? How many times had he looked at me with those same eyes while betraying me behind my back? What did the mate bond mean to him?

""Sherry?"" His voice was uncertain now, perhaps finally sensing that his usual charm wasn't working.

The disgust that rose in my throat was so sudden and violent that I had to swallow hard to keep it down. This man—this stranger wearing my mate's face had the audacity to stand in our home and lie to me with such practiced ease.

Kane stepped closer, his arms reaching out to embrace me from behind. ""Don't overthink this, love. You know how much you mean to me.""

I jerked away from his touch as if burned, the contact making my skin crawl.

Kane's eyes widened at my reaction, but he misread it entirely. ""Tomorrow is our bonding anniversary. I've given the entire pack the day off so we can celebrate properly. The whole territory will be honoring our bond.""

Our bond. The words sounded hollow in my ears as 1 stared at the man who had once been my everything, now nothing more than a beautiful lie.

My wolf let out a bitter, mocking growl.

Anniversary? How meaningless it felt after his betrayal.

How ridiculous he looked, pretending nothing had happened.

Our bond... it never truly reached that point.

ーー

The next morning dawned bright and clear, perfect weather for a celebration I no longer wanted. The pack gathered in the ceremonial square, their faces bright with anticipation as Kane took center stage.

He looked magnificent, I had to admit. Dressed in traditional ceremonial robes, his dark hair gleaming in the sunlight, every inch the powerful Alpha our pack adored. When he smiled, several young she-wolves in the crowd actually sighed.

""Six years ago,"" Kane announced, his voice carrying easily across the square, “I found my mate, my Luna, my heart’s other half.”

The crowd erupted in cheers as he gestured for me to join him. I walked forward on unsteady legs, feeling like an actress playing a role 1 no longer understood.

Kane handed me a bouquet of white roses-my favorite flowers. The irony wasn't lost on me that they symbolized purity and new beginnings when our relationship was built on lies and heading toward its end.

""Sherry,"" he said, loud enough for everyone to hear, ""you are my moon, my stars, my everything.
I love you more with each passing day.""

The crowd went wild, young she-wolves pressing their hands to their hearts and sighing at the romantic display. Kane basked in their adoration, his chest puffing with pride at their praise.

""So romantic!""

""Alpha Kane is so devoted!""

""Luna Sherry is so lucky!""

If only they knew. If only they could see past the performance to the rot underneath.

As fireworks exploded overhead and the pack cheered our ""perfect love,"" I felt nothing but emptiness. No amount of public declarations could erase what I'd seen, what I knew, what I'd been living with for months.

""Kane,"" I said when the noise died down, my voice carefully neutral. ""I'd like to visit my mother for a while. I think some time away would be good for me.""

Kane's smile faltered slightly, but he recovered quickly. ""Of course, love. You've been working so hard managing pack affairs. A little break will do you good.""

He had no idea that I was already planning my escape, that every word he spoke only drove the knife deeper into my resolve.

""I won't be able to handle pack duties while I'm gone,"" I continued.

""Don't worry about that,"" Kane waved dismissively. ""Take all the time you need.""

After the ceremony, Kane insisted we visit his father. James lived in the old Alpha house, a imposing stone structure that had housed pack leaders for generations. As we approached the front door, my stomach clenched with familiar dread.

James opened the door before we could knock, his cold gray eyes immediately focusing on me with undisguised displeasure. At sixty-five, he remained an intimidating figure—tall, broad-shouldered, with silver hair and the bearing of a man accustomed to absolute authority. 

""Kane,"" he greeted his son warmly before his gaze shifted to me. ""Sherry.""

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees.

""Father,"" Kane said, oblivious to the tension. ""We just wanted to stop by after the ceremony.""

""Of course. Come in."" James stepped aside, but his eyes never left my face. ""Kane, I need to discuss some border patrol schedules with you. Perhaps you could check the maps in my study?""

""Can't it wait?"" Kane asked. ""We just got here.""

'It's urgent,"" James insisted. ""Sherry won't mind waiting in the living room, will you, dear?""

The endearment dripped with false sweetness.

Kane, ever trusting of his own charm, leaned in and kissed my cheek-but I pulled away, letting only the brush of his lips graze my skin. I couldn't tolerate any of his intimacy.

The thought of him with Elsa made my stomach twist with disgust.

He smiled faintly and turned toward the study, completely unaware of the storm he'd left behind.

""I'll just be a few minutes,"" he promised.

The moment Kane disappeared down the hallway, James's mask dropped completely. He moved to stand directly in front of me, his imposing frame designed to intimidate.

""So,"" he said, his voice low and menacing, ""Another year of your... successful... bond with my son.""

I remained silent, having learned long ago that anything I said would only provide him with ammunition.

""Six years,"" James continued, beginning to pace like a predator circling its prey. ""Six years of marriage, and what do you have to show for it? Where are the heirs you promised? Where are the strong pups that should be carrying on our bloodline?""

His words hit their intended target. The inability to conceive had been a source of private anguish for years, made worse by James's constant reminders of my ""failure.""

""I introduced Kane to so many suitable females,"" James went on, his voice growing sharper.
""Daughters of elders, sisters of other Alphas, she-wolves with proper breeding and proven fertility.
But no he had to have you.""

""James —"" I began, but he cut me off with a sharp gesture. 

""You've been nothing but a disappointment from the beginning. Sherry, Ill grant you that, but beauty fades. What lasting value do you bring to this pack? To this family?""

For years, I had endured these attacks in silence, biting my tongue and swallowing my pride for the sake of pack harmony. But something had shifted inside me. Maybe it was seeing Kane with Elsa, maybe it was Maxine's words about ending our bond, or maybe I was simply tired of being everyone's scapegoat.

""You're right,"" I said quietly, my voice steady despite the storm raging inside me.

James paused mid-pace, clearly not expecting agreement.

""I have been a disappointment,"" I continued, rising from my chair to face him directly. ""But not in the way you think.""

""What's that supposed to mean?"" James demanded, his eyes narrowing.

""I've been disappointing myself by staying silent, by accepting blame for things beyond my control, by pretending this family's dysfunction is somehow my fault.""

James's face darkened. ""How dare you—""

""How dare I what? Tell the truth?"" I stepped closer, my own anger finally finding its voice. ""You want to know why I haven't given Kane children? Maybe it's because I've been too busy covering for his affairs and managing a pack while you undermine me at every turn.""

""You ungrateful—"" James's voice thundered, his Alpha aura slamming through the room.

""I'm done being grateful for scraps of basic decency,"" I cut in, my tone sharp enough to slice through his rage. ""And I'm done pretending this bond is sacred when it's been nothing but a cage."" 

He froze, nostrils flaring. ""What are you saying?""

I met his eyes squarely. ""I'm saying I'm ending it. The bond. With Kane.""

For a moment, silence—heavy, suffocating. Then the color drained from his face.

""No bond means no Luna,"" he hissed. ""No Luna means chaos. You'd destroy the pack-my son's legacy—for your pride?""

A bitter laugh escaped me. ""Your son's legacy? Tell me, James... how much of it was ever really his?""

His gaze sharpened, confusion flickering beneath his fury. ""What the hell is that supposed to mean?""

I took a slow step forward, letting every word land like a blade.

""You've blamed me for not giving Kane an heir for six years. Called me barren. Weak. Unfit.""

My voice trembled—not with fear, no, but with something colder. ""But you never stopped to wonder why I couldn't conceive, did you?"" 

His brows furrowed. ""Enough of your lies—“

""No,"" I cut him off, my voice calm but sharp as glass. ""I couldn't bear a child because of you. Did you really think I didn't know what you did behind my back?""

James went still.

The color drained completely from his face, fury and dawning horror warring behind his eyes.

""What-what did you just say?"" he rasped.

I didn't give him the chance to pretend anymore.

""Drop the act, James.""

My voice cut through the room like a blade of ice.

The golden light caught in his glass of whiskey trembled as his hand stilled. For a moment, even the ticking clock seemed to stop.

He blinked, surprise flashing across his face before the mask of calm superiority returned.

""I'm not sure what you mean.""

I stepped closer, pressing my palms flat on his desk. ""Don't play dumb. The supplements, the altered test results, the missing reports everything points back to you. You've been poisoning me for years. Don't you think it's time to stop pretending to be the noble patriarch?""

Something dark flickered in his eyesshock, irritation, maybe even fear. Then he exhaled slowly and set his glass down with deliberate care.

""Well,"" he said at last, his tone dry, measured, and void of emotion. ""I suppose there's no point in keeping up appearances if you've already figured it out.""

He leaned back in his chair, shoulders relaxing as if he'd been waiting for this moment. ""Yes. I made sure you wouldn't bear my son an heir.""

My stomach twisted. Even though I had known, hearing him admit it sent a cold wave of nausea through me.

""You destroyed my life,"" I whispered. ""You made me think I was broken.""

He didn't flinch. ""You were never meant to be Luna in the first place. No family name, no lineage, no connections. Just a pretty little outsider who caught Kane's attention. I did what I had to do to protect our pack's bloodline-and his future.""

There was no remorse in his tone, only calculation.

He spoke of cruelty like it was duty, of betrayal like it was logic.

I stared at him, the man who had smiled at our bonding ceremony, who'd handed me tea every morning with poison disguised as kindness. My wolf, Maxine, snarled inside me, her fury barely restrained. But beneath that fury, something colder took rootclarity.
I almost laughed at the audacity. ""You succeeded, then. Congratulations.""

""T'll end my bond with Kane.""

The words came out calm and clean, sharper than any scream. ""You wanted me gone? Fine. But you'll pay for every year you stole from me.""

He tilted his head, amusement flickering at the corner of his mouth. ""You're bargaining now?""

""Yes."" I met his gaze unflinchingly. ""Ten million. For the damage you've done—and for your silence. No one ever has to know the real reason I couldn't bear children. Not Kane. Not the pack."" He went very still, the calculation back in his eyes.

I could almost see the gears turning — his reputation, the risk, the cost.

Finally, he nodded once. ""Ten million. But you disappear quietly. No drama. No explanations.""

""Agreed.""

We shook hands. His touch was cold and dry, the handshake of a man who'd just traded away his conscience.

As I turned to leave, the air in the room felt thinner, emptier. For a moment, I thought I'd feel relief.

That evening, I lay in our bed, staring at the ceiling as Kane emerged from the bathroom, steam still clinging to his skin. He slipped under the covers beside me, pulling me close with the same possessive gentleness that once made my heart flutter.

I didn't move. I couldn't.

""Mmm, you smell good,"" he murmured against my hair, his hands sliding over me with the confidence of someone who believed we were the same as always.

I pressed myself into the mattress, forcing my body to remain still. I didn't want this—not now, not ever.

""I've been thinking,"" Kane continued, voice soft and dreamy, ""about our future. About finally having that heir we've been trying for.""

My stomach churned, and I stayed silent, letting the words wash over me.

He rolled slightly, nudging me closer, his lips brushing my neck. ""I can picture it, you know? A little one running through the pack house, learning to shift, to hunt, to lead."" His hands traced my sides as though envisioning the life he wanted, not noticing the stiffness in my body. ""The pack needs continuity, Sherry. They need to know the bloodline will continue.""
I didn't respond. I didn't resist—not yet. He didn't sense the tension in my limbs, didn't pause to notice the cold distance in my eyes. To him, this was a shared dream.

When he moved lower, intending more intimacy, I still didn't pull away. I couldn't trust myself to act, couldn't bear to give him the satisfaction of my struggle.

Then-the sharp buzz of a phone.
Kane ignored it at first. But it buzzed again, insistent.

""Damn it,"" he muttered, reaching for the nightstand.

I caught the name on the screen before he did:

Elsa.

""Emergency pack business,"" he said without looking at me, already disentangling from the bed.

""I have to go.""

I exhaled slowly, relief and betrayal tangled in my chest.

""Now?"" I asked quietly, already knowing the answer.

""You know how it is,"" he replied, his mind elsewhere, as he pulled on his clothes. ""Alpha duties don't wait.""
I watched him dress, my chest tight, my wolf restless inside me, and thought of the lie of his kisses, the false promises, and the truth I now carried.

He bent to kiss my forehead, the gesture meaningless, and was gone, leaving the bed-and the room—steeped in the scent of his oblivious betrayal.

And then he was gone, leaving me alone with the scent of his lies hanging in the air.

— — —

I lay there in the darkness, my mind drifting back through the years. Our first meeting at the inter-pack gathering, the way his eyes had lit up when he saw me. Our first dance, first kiss, the night we bonded under the full moon. He had been so different then—or maybe I had just been too naive to see the truth.

Maxine stirred restlessly in my mind, her agitation growing stronger by the minute.

Something's wrong, she whispered. Something's very wrong.

I could feel it too—a strange energy building in my chest, like a storm gathering strength. Maxine began to pace frantically in my consciousness, her distress bleeding into my physical body.

He's with her, Maxine snarled. I can feel his betrayal. I can taste it.

The sensation grew stronger-wilder. My wolf was losing control, her rage and hurt turning into a physical force that tightened my chest and stole my breath.

""Calm down,"" I whispered to her, but she couldn't hear me over her own fury.

I rolled over, trying to find stillness, but unease only clawed deeper. I shifted again, my body tense, yet something inside me felt suffocated. My heart pounded too tast, too hard. Then my limbs began to tremble.

Oh no... something's wrong.

""What can we do, Maxine?"" I called out to my wolf, but 1 could feel her distress too—weak, unsteady. My breaths grew shallow, each one thinner than the last. I needed help. I needed a hospital. But there was no one around.

Kane. He must be with Elsa right now.

Then Monica—my best friend. I needed her.

Just as I was about to mindlink her, I remembered she was out of town on business.

Still... I had to try someone.

No... there was only Kane. Even if I didn't want to trouble him.

Fighting through the dizziness, I opened the mind-link.

Kane, I need help. I can't breathe, I—

The connection snapped shut so fast it left me reeling. He'd cut me off —without even listening. Of course he had. He was busy. 

Gasping, wheezing, I forced myself out of bed.

The hospital. I have to get to the hospital.

My car keys felt impossibly heavy in my shaking hands, but somehow, I made it to the garage.

The drive was a blur of red lights and shallow breaths. Every turn of the wheel was a battle, every minute an eternity. But I was close—so close.

By the time my car skidded to a stop in front of the hospital, I had barely enough strength to push the door open. The moment I stepped out, the world tilted violently. My vision spun and dimmed until everything dissolved into darkness.

Just before I slipped into unconsciousness, a scent brushed past mefamiliar, intoxicating, unlike anything I had ever smelled before.

But try as I might, I couldn't place where I had encountered it.

Sharp, clean... unforgettable.

""Madam, Are you okay?""

The voice cut through the haze—deep, steady, and hauntingly familiar.

""God, it's you!""

That beautiful tone... I knew I had to have heard it somewhere before.

But what did he mean. Did he know me?

I tried to ask him, but my lips refused to move. My body felt weightless, every heartbeat stealing the last of my strength. Yet even as everything taded, my hand wouldn't let go-my fingers were still locked around the sleeve of his suit, clutching it as if my life depended on it.

Then, strong arms gathered me up from the ground. The moment his skin brushed mine, something inside me sparked a pulse of recognition, a pull I couldn't explain.

Every cell in my body came alive beneath his touch.

Even as the darkness swallowed me whole, 1 knew I would never forget that feeling.

And then... I surrendered to it.

The next morning, 1 slowly opened my eyes. My hand was still clenched tightly around a button.

The moment I saw it, my heart skipped a beat—l knew exactly whose it was. The button had come from the sleeve of that mysterious stranger's suit yesterday. I brought it closer to my nose and inhaled. The scent... that scent was still intoxicating, stirring something wild inside me.

Maxine, my wolf, shivered with restless delight, unable to contain herself.

""Ah, you're awake!"" a cheerful voice said. The doctor sitting besides me, smiling warmly. ""How are you feeling today?""

I glanced around and noticed a vase of fresh flowers on the bedside table. My brow furrowed in surprise.

""They're from your... mate,"" the doctor said casually, as if it were obvious. ""Quite the handsome one too. When he left, he even draped his coat over you.""

I bit the inside of my cheek, suppressing a wry smile. Several doctors in the room were clearly captivated, murmuring to each other about how handsome my ""mate"" was. Only I knew the truth
—the man who had brought me here yesterday wasn't Kane at all. At that very moment, Kane was busy elsewhere, entertaining another she-wolf.

Swallowing hard, I asked cautiously, ""Doctor... what exactly is my condition?""

Her expression softened. ""Well... you're pregnant.""

Pregnant. The word hit me like a lightning strike.

My mouth went dry. I hadn't expected it-not now, not after all these years of hoping for an Alpha heir under James' schemes. And certainly not now, after I had made the decision to end my bond with Kane. This... this changed everything.

My plan, my control—it all felt like it was slipping through my fingers.

Noticing the storm behind my eyes, the doctor offered a small smile. ""Don't worry. I've already informed your mate that you're pregnant... and honestly, I don't know how he didn't notice sooner.""

I looked down at the clothes on my body and the button in my hand. My chest tightened. For a man I had never met, this Alpha had done so much for me. Paid my hospital fees, sent flowers, brought my clothes... and yet I didn't even know his name.

My mind began to wander, imagining him, replaying the feel of his presence, his scent, his strength.

A sudden laugh cut through my daydream, sharp and familiar. My heart jolted.

I turned my head.

Elsa and Kane stood at the doorway. Elsa held a bouquet of lilies, her lips curling into a bright, mocking smile that didn't reach her eyes.

""Sherry,"" she said sweetly, her tone soaked in poison.  ""I heard you were unwell, but honestly you look surprisingly radiant for someone who just fainted. Must've had good company taking care of you, hmm?""

I didn't answer. My silence only seemed to amuse her more.

Kane walked past her quickly, setting a box of fruit and a bouquet on the table beside my bed.

""Sherry,"" he said softly, his voice filled with practiced remorse. ""I'm sorry about yesterday. I was tied up with work-urgent pack matters. I should've been there.""

Work.

Right.

Or Elsa's bed?

I gave him a cold, humorless smile. He kept talking, words tumbling out like a rehearsed speech-excuses, apologies, the same lines I'd heard a hundred times before.

Then he leaned closer, lowering his voice, his hand brushing the edge of my blanket.

""I missed you,"" he murmured, eyes glinting with fake sincerity. ""You know you're the only one who matters to me.""

I turned my head just before his lips could touch my cheek.

""Careful,"" I said, my tone soft but sharp enough to cut. ""You wouldn't want your business matters to misunderstand.""

Elsa's smile faltered for a split second before reforming into something sharper.

""Oh, come now,"" she drawled, folding her arms as that mocking smile curved her lips. ""No wonder Kane's been so distant lately. The way you looked at him—like you disgust him. How tragic for an Alpha to have such a cold Luna. Honestly, I almost feel sorry for him.""

I tilted my head, matching her tone with an icy smile. ""Really? Because from where I'm standing, you seem very concerned about my mate's happiness. Tell me, are you just being kind... or is there something going on between you two that I don't know about?""

The air between us crackled.

Kane's expression darkened. ""Sherry!"" he snapped. ""Watch your tone. Elsa came here out of kindness—""

""Kindness?"" I interrupted, voice laced with quiet laughter. ""That's what we're calling it now?""

Elsa took a step closer, her perfume cloying, her smile widening. ""You're right,” she said softly. ""It's not kindness. It's pity. I almost feel sorry for you-left alone while your mate finds comfort elsewhere. But I suppose every Luna needs a backup plan, right? Is that what he is, Sherry? The man whose scent is still all over you?""

The world went still.

Kane's gaze snapped to me, sharp and accusing.

His nostrils flared as he stepped closer, inhaling like a predator catching a new scent.

""That scent..."" His voice dropped an octave, dark and dangerous. ""Whose is it?""

He glanced down and froze— the button clutched in my hand, the clean shirt draped over my lap.

Elsa's eyes gleamed, triumph flickering in their depths. ""Oh, this just gets better,"" she purred. ""Tell us, Luna —did he undress you himself, or was it before or after he saved you? Should we be congratulating you on your recovery, or your new conquest?""

My wolf stirred, furious beneath my skin.

""Careful, Elsa,"" I said, voice low and steady. ""If you talk too much, people might start wondering why you know so much about seducing someone else's mate.""

Gasps rippled through the room. Nurses had gathered near the door, whispering behind their hands.

Kane's jaw clenched, fury flushing his face red.

""Enough!"" he roared. ""Sherry, how dare you treat Elsa like this! She came here out of concern for you, and this is how you repay her? With insults and lies?""

His voice boomed, echoing off the sterile walls.

""And,"" he hissed, his eyes narrowing, ""I'd really like to see which rogue thinks he can walk into my territory and lay a hand on my Luna!""

The temperature in the room seemed to drop suddenly. A sudden, overwhelming presence pressed into the air, and my entire body stiffened.

Every nerve in my body screamed.

The nurses froze. Patients turned, eyes wide. Kane himself took an instinctive step back, his usual arrogance faltering.

I inhaled sharply, catching the familiar, intoxicating scent again. My wolf Maxine roared in delight, wild and unrestrained.

Then a voice rang out, calm, controlled, and impossibly commanding:

""I am.""

1p9yusb,https://www.reddit.com/r/e39/comments/1p9yusb/e39_temp_gauge_issue/,E39 temp gauge issue,"I recently had my E39 530i serviced — the tensioner pulley and belt were replaced, and while they were in there they also noticed a small thermostat leak, so that was replaced as well. Everything has been running perfectly for about three weeks since the work was done.

Today, I let the E39 warm up while I was getting ready to head out. It was about –24°C outside. When I got into the car, I noticed the temperature gauge was pegged all the way into the red — but the red warning light wasn’t illuminated. The engine sounded completely normal: no rough running, no smoke, nothing out of the ordinary. Still, it was a little alarming, so I shut it off right away.

When I restarted it, the gauge immediately showed the proper reading — about a quarter up into the cold range, which made sense because the car wasn’t even close to warmed up yet. I drove to get coffee (about 5 minutes) and the temperature stayed perfectly in the middle. I continued driving around to do errands and everything stayed normal the entire time.

Could this be related to the thermostat replacement — maybe air in the cooling system or an issue with the bleeding procedure? Or possibly a coolant temperature sensor glitch? No CEL, no warnings, and the car only has 80,000 miles.

I know these cars can be a bit tricky to bleed properly (I’ve owned a couple E46s), but I always had a shop handle it. Just wanted to get some thoughts, since my shop is closed for the weekend.",1,1764447916.0,e39,2,1.0,False
1p9yuev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1p9yuev/anxiety_when_playing_games/,Anxiety when playing games,"So i’ve been playing games for probably around 10-15 years now, more or less with some longer or shorter breaks and i’ve been dealing with anxiety for last few years now. Recently i am noticing that playing games makes me feel much worse. It’s usually Overwatch and Marvel Rivals, which i am not playing competitively but as many of you know they are MP, online shooters you play with and against other players. Even after few games and for a very short session, i would get red and hot in the face, my blood pressure would go slightly up, many times i would start shaking and feeling some kind of pressure in the chest. My posture would also become very questionable and problematic, i would breathe shortly and many times start feeling some kind of pain and sensations in my back and front neck… I feel like this gets even more elevated if i had a coffee, i usually only drink one coffee every day and i am noticing that symptoms are worse if i had a coffee.

Is anyone else dealing with this and does anyone have any kind of advice, other than “stop playing games totally”? Thanks!",2,1764447888.0,Anxiety,3,1.0,False

1p9yt9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/1p9yt9c/question_for_american_liberals_why_should_i_feel/,Question for American liberals: why should I feel politically alarmed when my daily life in 2025 is stable and fulfilling?,"I keep seeing a lot of liberals using very alarmist language about how Trump's second term is going and the general state of American politics. I get why politics matters, and I’m not saying people shouldn’t care, but I’m struggling to feel the level of panic I see online. I am wondering if I am missing something.

For context, I am in my 30s, make around $80k in a white collar role, and live in a major US metro that is not SF or NYC. I'm a woman of color (Hispanic, 3rd generation daughter of legal immigrants), and not really privileged. I am not rich, but I am not poor either. Nothing in my personal life has really gotten worse. Things are actually going pretty well.

I have a solid social life. I go out with friends, hit bars and clubs, check out comedy shows, spend time in coffee shops and restaurants, enjoy TV, movies, books, and video games. I love theme parks and went on some incredible roller coasters last weekend. I mountain bike a lot too. Day to day, life is pretty fun. I live in a pretty diverse area and rarely have experienced racism or sexism from people or institutions. In fact, I benefited from affirmative action in the past. 

I live in a suburban-ish area where you need a car, but honestly it is not bad. I actually like driving. My rent is reasonable with more space than I would get in a dense city. Having a car makes groceries, trips out of town, and access to nature really easy. My city has big parks, trails, malls, and social hubs where people walk around and hang out. If you want something that feels more urban or walkable, you just drive there. I live in one of those master planned areas that makes the driving part less miserable.

Healthcare is mostly covered by my employer. Costs are annoying sometimes, but manageable. The biggest concern I have as a woman is reproductive rights. But even for that, I've always made sure to practice personal responsibility and have safe sex with partners, including taking birth control. I live in a state that has abortion access, and it's near the border where women from other states come from for abortions. I'm pro-choice, but this isn't something that's affected me personally yet. 

The vast majority of people I know live similar middle class lives. Poor and vulnerable people absolutely exist and deserve protection. I am not pretending they do not matter. I am just saying that for most people I personally interact with, life seems pretty normal.

Inflation sucked, but it was also high under Biden. Most of that was supply chain shock. We adjusted. Prices are still annoying, but it is not life ruining for me or my peers.

I can still save enough to take one international trip per year with friends and a few domestic ones. I am big into the NFL and college football and love to travel for games.

On top of that, my personal life is the best it has ever been. I got engaged to the love of my life. My fiance is a 2nd generation Indian-American and his family is thriving in running a small business. I have a strong social circle. I got promoted to manager at work. I genuinely enjoy living in 2025.

So I guess my question for liberals is this. How am I supposed to feel an urgent sense of political alarm when my lived reality is stable, comfortable, and full of good things? What am I missing that others are seeing?",0,1764447808.0,AskALiberal,124,0.35,False

I have a divorce lawyer, a crown attorney, children to co-parent (I do majority parenting), a full time job, extracurricular for the kids, therapy, and no friends or family nearby. I thankfully go for a drive and visit my parents once a week with the kids.

I initially moved away to be with my ex and have lost touch with old friends. My recent friends were his family, who live close by. They have since cut ties with me due to all of this. I don’t regret losing ties with old friends, and although his family cutting ties with me hurts, I expected it and it’s probably for the best.

Although I talk with my family, I really wish I had friends to talk to. I have neighbours, work acquaintances, but no real friends. I’ve tried friend apps for years with little success. I’ve met other parents from daycare and school several times but we’re all so busy it’s a rare event. I’m also hoping to move soon and don’t know where I’ll end up, just somewhere within a few hours driving distance. And I am so exhausted from the rest of life that I’m reluctant to put in the work to try anymore.

Plus I worry that I’m so pent up from not having friends that I’ll just trauma dump everything going on and scare them off. 

The time I get alone from the kids I hate but I’m trying to use to engage in hobbies to curb the loneliness. 

Can anyone else relate? How did you get over this hump and feel ready to put yourself out there for friendship? And how the heck did you make it work and get past a few coffee chats :p

Martín's tired face was reflected in the fogged-up window of the neighborhood cafe. The raindrops sliding down the glass seemed to be running faster than life since Ana was gone. One ordinary afternoon, with a gray sky and a blank mind, he felt like a ship adrift, without direction or anchor. After ten years, that word that used to sound so vibrant, “love,” was now just a distant echo that tormented him.

Days and nights blended into a whirlwind of memories and sadness. Ana's absence left a void that ate away at every corner of her being. Their laughter, their shared dreams, everything vanished into thin air when she decided there was no more love to give. Instead, Martin found himself surrounded by unpaid bills, remnants of a life that was once promising and full of plans.

One morning, while flipping through an old photo album, he came across a snapshot in which they were both smiling happily on a beach. Nostalgia hit him hard; That's when he decided he needed a change. ""I can't stay here like this,"" he muttered to himself, wiping away his tears with the sleeve of his shirt.

With renewed determination, Martin began looking for work. He enrolled in photography courses, a passion he had put aside for years. As the weeks passed, life began to take shape again. Each image captured became a small triumph. The camera became his companion, a new love that began to heal the wounds.

The first day of the photography exhibition he organized, he was filled with nervousness. I still couldn't believe I had made it this far. Looking at the works on display, he saw a representation of his transformation: images of lonely landscapes glowing with unexpected beauty, each reflecting his own internal struggle and search for meaning.

Among the visitors, a woman stopped in front of an image of a sunrise in the mountains. His eyes lit up. He approached Martín, and after a few minutes of chatting, they decided to share a cup of coffee. Her name was Clara, and she had been through her own personal storm. They talked about art, about life, about loss. With each conversation, Martín felt how part of his heaviness faded away.

As the days turned into months, Martin began to understand that love was not completely gone. It was a cycle, not an end. Ana had been a part of his narrative, but not the closure of his story. With Clara, he began to rediscover the meaning of companionship, albeit with caution.

Finally, as he sat on his balcony one sunny afternoon, camera in hand and new hope in his heart, he understood that life always offers a second chance, and that sometimes, letting go can be the first step toward rebuilding. More than a goodbye, Ana's departure became a blank canvas on which she could paint her new destiny.

Thus, in the city that had seen its collapse, a new beginning also flourished. The traces of yesterday, although present, became part of its history, a story that still had much to tell.",1,1764447631.0,AmazingStories,1,1.0,False

You start businesses and make sure you don't go bankrupt.

Rent buildings, hire staff, set prices, and keep stock full.

Later, you rent warehouses/offices, hire delivery drivers, pay tax, etc

**You start with roughly £30,000 to get yourself going.**

If you mess up, you lose money, and you'll have to start over again.

You also face 14 rivals who start price wars and steal customers. 

This is a real tycoon management type of game where you try to grow your business and climb the leaderboard. I spent about 6 months building it from scratch. Another similar game is Coffee Inc. 2. Business Inc Tycoon Sim has been out now for about 3 weeks, almost at 1k downloads. 

Also launched a new Discord channel was launched for players to share strategies, and it's looking really promising that this game will do very well.

The whole thing started because I have ADHD and I kept breaking focus every time I needed to message my boss or teammate. I’d grab my phone “just to send one quick message,” and suddenly I’m looking at random notifications, DMs, memes, whatever. Total flow killer.

Recently I saw ThePrimeagen demo that you could literally buy his coffee from the terminal, and that pushed me down the rabbit hole of “why am I leaving the terminal just to communicate in the first place?”

So I built a minimal chat app you can access entirely over SSH:

    ssh ssh.shello.dev

You enter your passkey and you’re in. No browser, no Electron, no extra UI. Just a quiet little chat room that lives inside the terminal where I’m already working.

To be clear, this isn’t meant to replace iMessage/Discord/Slack for your whole life. You’ll still use your phone for your mom or whatever. It’s specifically for *work mode* quick communication without yanking your brain out of the codebase.

**Visiting Napa Valley and tired of the $50 coffee and $100 tasting fees?** While Yountville and downtown Napa are great, the real local character shines in the smaller towns up-valley and down-valley.

Here is a quick guide to some off-the-beaten-path coffee, shopping, and low-key bars in **St. Helena, Calistoga, and American Canyon.**



# ☕ St. Helena: Coffee, Delis, and Dive Bar Charm



The main street is picturesque, but head one block over for the true local pulse.

* **Local Coffee Break:** **Valley Caffe** (1142 Main St). Forget the fancy espresso bars. This spot is a quintessential, no-frills local cafe serving up strong coffee and classic breakfast/lunch items. It's where the vineyard workers and lifelong locals start their day.
* **The Deli Staple:** **Giugni's Deli** (1227 Main St). A long-time favorite deli and an *absolute must* for a budget lunch. Order a classic sandwich (The Giugni Special is legendary) and take it to a park for a picnic. It's been a St. Helena institution forever.
* **Low-Key Bar:** **Ana's Cantina** (1205 Main St). Tucked away on Main Street, this is the classic definition of a **St. Helena dive bar**. Cash-only, a jukebox, pool table, and a ceiling covered in dollar bills. A welcome break from wine-centric spots.



# ♨️ Calistoga: Mud Baths, Old School Shops, and Good Eats



Calistoga has a unique, rustic feel thanks to its hot springs and laid-back vibe.

* **Unique Antique Find:** **Rags to Riches Unique Antique Boutique** (1125 Lincoln Ave). This is less ""fancy home goods"" and more ""curated vintage treasures."" It's a great spot to find a truly unique souvenir that isn't a corkscrew.
* **The Go-To Cafe:** **Cafe Sarafornia** (1413 Lincoln Ave). An old-school, friendly Calistoga diner. They serve great breakfast and lunch at reasonable prices, and the staff treats you like a regular, even if it's your first time. Their coffee and hearty portions are perfect before a day of tasting or hiking.
* **Insider's Tip:** Check out **Calistoga Country Antiques** (1117 Lincoln Ave) for more traditional vintage finds, rounding out your antique tour.



# 🌉 American Canyon: The Gateway Town's Hidden Gems



Often overlooked as the ""entry point"" to the valley, American Canyon has some great local finds and views near the Carneros region.

* **Unexpected Culinary Gem:** **LASO** (various locations, check online). While the town is full of great, low-cost taco trucks and casual spots, LASO serves **Nepalese-inspired dishes** (like delicious momo dumplings) with a California flair. A fantastic and unique break from wine country cuisine.
* **Outdoor Escape:** **Wetlands Edge Park & Napa River Bay Trail.** Perfect for bird watching or an easy, flat walk (great for kids or a quick leg-stretcher). You get serene views of the marshlands and the Napa River, offering a completely different scenic perspective than the vineyards.
* **The Local's Store:** **Marshall's Farm Honey.** This honey farm offers raw, all-natural honey and is a great little stop for a picnic or to pick up a fantastic local product that’s not wine.
