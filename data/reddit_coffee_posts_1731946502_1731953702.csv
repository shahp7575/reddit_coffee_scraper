1gub99j,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1gub99j/saas_sunday_building_a_highperformance_security/,SaaS Sunday: Building a high-Performance Security Header Scanner on a Budget in one day,"I want to share some **technical** tips I found useful during a fun project I did past weekend. My goal was to [build a SaaS in a day](https://seqr-byte.be/building-headerscan-com-high-performance-security-scanner-on-a-budget/) with a budget of a coffee, to see what happens. The SaaS is a free to use tool to check the security headers of your website. It's not monetised, but created for fun and to learn from for myself. [You can check the website/SaaS out here](https://headerscan.com).  
[Full Blogpost here. ](https://seqr-byte.be/building-headerscan-com-high-performance-security-scanner-on-a-budget/)

Here are my take-aways:

# 1. Use Cloudflare's Free Tier

It's severely underrated how much faster and secure you can build your website/SaaS with Cloudflare. Their free plan is sufficient for most starting up SaaS and websites, so I highly recommend it. Their [caching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/) gives faster global results, **improving user experience and SEO** (because Google doesn't like slow websites). A server in Europe can be slow in USA, but if you use Cloudflare caching it's much faster globally.

[Cloudflare Rate limiting ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/)helps you protect your (public or private) API. This to **protect against bots** **or** just clients who **abuse**/over-use your endpoints who are resource intensive.

They have a whole range of other tools like [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) and [Page rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/page-rules/) which can make you or your developers create more secure and faster SaaS/websites.

# 2. Limits and help of AI:

[Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) (sonnet 3.5) is at this point in time king for writing code. It's **great for generating Front-end code**, but **not so great (yet) for back end code**. In fact, if you have an API, you can provide an example output, paste it inside [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) and have it generate a frontend with your desired CSS (like tailwindCSS) or React.  
[Example of such a prompt. ](https://seqr-byte.be/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-5.webp)

I don't recommend it for back end code, because the prompt and response size is limited. Better is to use something like Code Pilot, but there you have the typical ""wow, it generated this code in 5 seconds. But I had to debug it in 5 hours and in the end it didn't integrate in the codebase"".

# 3. For your backend, create a docker container

An initial PoC is essential in a startup/SaaS. But spending some time to create a docker container makes it so much easier to deploy and change from cloud environments. Docker is created to solve the ""it works on my computer"" problem. Also, it creates room to make it scaleable in the future (Kubernetes/...).

If you use Python, I recommend gunicorn and a threaded Flask server to prepare for heavy load.

1gub8lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1gub8lt/i_nearly_met_myself/,I nearly met myself?,"Alright. this happened about two months ago, and I haven’t stopped thinking about it. AFter stumbling across these Glitch in the matrix videos that keep coming up on youtube, I thought i'd share it with you all. I’ve got no explanation, maybe one of you does? I need to know if anyone else has ever had something like this happen. 

I work a pretty boring nine-to-five job in a mid-sized office building. Every day, I go to the same coffee shop across the street around 2 p.m. for my caffeine fix. I’m such a regular that the barista, Sam, automatically starts making my order when he sees me in line.

On this particular day, I left my office a little later than usual, around 2:15. When I reached the door in the lobby, I realised I'd left my keycard on my desk on the other side of the building. But, that was no problem, the secretary, Sarah, signed me out on paper. This happens all the time.

As I crossed the street and approached the coffee shop, I saw myself. Me, wearing the Same clothes, same bag, same everything. Standing at the counter inside, chatting with Sam.

I froze. My heart was racing, but my brain was like, “No, you’re imagining this.""

""Maybe it’s someone who just looks like you.” But then this other me turned slightly, and I got a perfect look at their face. It was my face. Down to the tiny birthmark i have under one eye.

I panicked. I turned around and walked back across the street without going inside. My hands were shaking. I kept telling myself it wasn’t real, that I must’ve been overtired or something. But here’s the thing: when I got back to my desk and looked in my bag, the coffee cup was there. The exact same coffee I was planning to order, with my name written on it in Sam’s handwriting. I never went into the shop. I never bought the coffee. But there it was, hot and fresh like I’d just picked it up.

I looked up at the clock, and the time was still 2:15, the usual time i'd get back after heading over and grabbing my coffee. But i'd definitely been outside for longer than a minute. It was like my timeline diverged. One version of me had split away at 2 pm and gone to grab the coffee, while I had stayed behind. And then when returning to the building, our timelines had merged again.

Even scarier than this thought, was which one had I been at that time? Was I the original me, or, was I some kind of duplicate for that time? I spent the rest of my work day just feeling very off about the whole thing. I didn't even drink the coffee.

It got me to wondering about the stories of shapeshifters, or doppelgängers i'd heard in the past, and I had to wonder if this is where some of those came from. Maybe two timelines split, or converge and you can be a two places at once for a short time. I wonder how many times this sort of thing happens without you noticing.

I haven’t told anyone at work because, let’s be real, they’d think I’m insane. But the secretary at the office does remember me heading out, and she remembers me having forgotten my keycard. But she says it happened at two, and it even says so on the log where she signed me out. I’ve gone back to the coffee shop since, and everything’s been normal. Though weirdly enough, Sam didn't remember me coming. The next day when I went to grab my coffee, he asked if I'd been off sick the day before.

So. If he never gave me a coffee that day, where did the coffee in my bag come from? Some parallel universe that collided with this one for a split second? How can him and sarah remember things so differently. Which one of these is even real?

I don't know. But I still have the cup. I wrote on it in red marker: ""This came from nowhere.""

It's in my kitchen cupboard now. I keep checking on it, just to remind myself that I didn't imagine the whole thing.

What the hell happened? Any Ideas?

Well. That sure is a spooky one. Kind of like my experience with my dad and the double moon. Strange that other people's memories can be affected or altered by these events.",1,1731953397.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,0,1.0,False

\### Background

42F, only ran longer distances than sprints in high school and college as coach-mandated punishment while playing soccer. After college, I learned pretty quickly how good a regular running routine felt both physically and mentally, and I've kept it up (minus a few medical breaks) for the last 20 years. (When people say something like ""You're so disciplined!"" about my running, my husband says it's like complimenting a gambling addict for having the discipline to go to the casino every night). I ran several marathons in my late 20s / early 30s and qualified for Boston a few times. My last marathon in 2013 was my PR, 3:28. Then, from 2014-2020, in the process of trying to have kids I had two miscarriages, four rounds of IVF, and (happily) two healthy kids, but two unplanned c-sections, the second with complications and a scary hemorrhage. I ran when I could during that stretch but had to take long stretches off and had to do a lot of PT to fix my separated abs.



When my youngest was 2, I finally felt physically ready to get back into serious running. I ramped up mileage, did better than I expected at a few local races, and then kept increasing volume and intensity. After PRing at 5K and 10K, I felt like I was ready to do another marathon.  



\### Training

I worked with an online coach, which was great. My summer running was discouraging because it was so hot and humid and my paces were so much slower; I felt like my fitness was terrible. I did basically a 16 week training cycle, averaging 45-50 mpw and peaking at 60.  



I had a tune-up HM scheduled in September, but I was pretty sick the few days leading up to the race. In retrospect I shouldn't have run it at all, but I thought maybe I could power through. I ended up dropping out at mile 5 -- I clearly wasn't going to gain any information about my fitness and was only going to dig myself deeper into a recovery hole by continuing. Logical, but I really beat myself up about the DNF, way more than I should have. 



I had a lot of angst about what race shoe to wear. For the prior two years, I ran all my races in Vaporfly 3s and loved them, but then over the summer, they started to rip painful blisters on the bottom of my right foot. I went to my local running store to see if I needed to upgrade my socks, but they said the socks I was currently wearing (Balega moisture wicking) were what they'd recommend anyway. I ran a tune-up 10 miler in October and ran 1:10 high, which was a PR; it was one of the first slightly colder days of the year and the first time I actually felt like maybe my fitness was coming together. It was only 10 miles, but the Vaporflys shredded my feet, so I knew I didn't want to wear them for the marathon. 



I started using the Superblast 2s as my daily shoe over the summer and absolutely love them, so I thought I'd try Asics for my race shoe. After boring my husband to tears with monologues wondering if I'm a stride runner or a cadence runner, I opted for the Metaspeed Edges. I put about 25 miles on them before the race, including a 16 miler with 12@MP, where I lost both middle toenails from blisters under the nails. But I figured now the nails are gone, so got that over with before the marathon (spoiler alert: foot problems were not over). 



\### Pre-race

I did the Featherstone 3-day carb load, aiming for 470g of carbs per day. It actually wasn't as bad as I thought it might be -- turns out I really like carbs. I found the toughest part was reducing my vegetable intake; I was craving a big salad by the end.



I asked my kids if they wanted to watch me run a marathon, and they said watching running was boring (fair). Also, they were very disappointed when they asked if I was going to win and I said no. So they stayed with my parents and my husband and I drove to Richmond for the weekend. 



Race morning I woke up at 4:15, had oatmeal, banana, and coffee for breakfast, and then hung out in my hotel room getting ready. We stayed in a hotel just a few blocks from the start line, which was amazing: I waited until about 6:35 to leave my room and jog over to the start. First race ever without using a port-a-potty because I was able to pee one final time in my hotel room. 



It was warmer than I had hoped in the starting corrals -- I was wearing layers I planned to toss in the first few miles, but I ended up tossing them all before the start. 



\### Race

The race started and I couldn't really believe it! My plan was to hold 7:40 pace consistently throughout the race and then see if I had anything left after mile 20. I got in the groove pretty quickly and tried to run even effort over the little rollers. The course was beautiful, there was great crowd support, and I felt mostly good. The miles running along the river were particularly scenic, and the weather was gorgeous (although I would have happily taken colder weather). 



About mile 3, I could feel my right foot moving more than it should in my shoe with each step. It was rubbing the skin on the bottom of my foot, and jamming my toes into the top of the shoe. I knew this was going to end badly, but nothing I could do about it now.



Miles 10-12 had some tough little rolling sections. I knew I had banked some time under 7:40 pace so I tried to keep my effort nice and easy on the uphills. 



I crossed the half in 1:39 high and was feeling great, minus the blisters forming. Pre-race I thought I had a shot at sub-3:20 if everything went right on race day, and I still felt like that goal was a possibility. I took a liquid GU every 30 minutes during the race and tried to take a few sips of Nuun at every stop if it wasn't too hard to get over to the side. 



Around mile 15, my foot started feeling like I was stepping on shards of glass with every step. It was very unpleasant. Miles 15-18 were also the toughest miles of the course for me. Mile 15 started a long uphill bridge crossing, but then when we finally got over the bridge, we continued on a steady uphill into a headwind. Finally, a little after mile 18, the course turned a corner out of the wind and off the hill. I was just trying to stay consistent and not use too much extra energy.



Around mile 19, the wheels really started to come off. The blister pain continued to stab with every step, and then my right hip locked up. I don't know whether I was altering my stride with the blister or whether my hip would have locked up anyway, but I felt like I was limping at that point. But still so far to go!



Every part of me wanted to stop, but I thought about all the 4:30 am wakeups, runs in the dark, social events I skipped, weird hotel treadmills I ran on at 5 am when I traveled for work, the number of mornings my husband handled the kids' morning routine so I could get a track workout in, and how long I'd been thinking about this race. I looked at my watch and thought that if I didn't slow down too much, I could still PR, BQ, and run a time I felt proud of, and I'd come too far to give up now. 



Somehow I put one foot in front of the other for the last 6-7 miles. It wasn't fast, but there was amazing crowd support and I just gritted it out. I converted it all to laps on the track in my head -- 16 laps to go, 15 laps to go, etc. For some reason that helps me during all my hard workouts. I had thought the last few miles were downhill, but it didn't feel that way until the very end, where the downhill was almost too steep to be helpful. I saw my husband at 25.5, then saw the finish line up ahead and gave one last push. Looked down at my watch and saw 3:22 -- a 6 minute PR from when I was 31 and an almost 13 minute BQ!





\### Post-race

I hobbled over to the medical tent thinking they could dress my blister, but they politely gave me a bandaid and told me to leave (I get it). I took my shoe off and my right foot was a crime scene -- multiple blood blisters under toenails, under toes, and one massive blister underneath my forefoot. My husband found me and I limped back to the hotel for a long shower, burger, and beer.



Like a true running sicko, I've already gone from thinking ""this is hell on earth; why would anyone do this to themselves"" at mile 22 to ""what race should I run next and how can I shave a few minutes off my time"" two days later. I'd like to run Boston 2026, so maybe a spring and fall marathon in 2025, or maybe shorter races in the spring and a fall marathon. I'm not really sure what to do about the blister situation except keep trying different socks and blister prevention products. 



Overall, I'd give very high marks to the Richmond marathon. I felt like the size was perfect -- I was never running alone but never felt crowded outside of the first half mile. The course itself had gorgeous and varied scenery, the crowd support was fantastic, and the on-course support was really excellent. I particularly enjoyed the two spots where they were handing out cold, wet washcloths; every race should do that. I would have preferred 10 degrees colder weather, but I don't think the weather played too much of a role in my time. I'd definitely recommend the race to anyone looking for a fall marathon.

If my old shower head was a person, it would be that passive-aggressive coworker who sighs loudly while making coffee. So, I decided to try out this one from AquaCare. Here's my thoughts.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Update:

**BEST PRICE on the AquaCare Shower Head here:**

[**https://amzn.to/4ewsJpu**](https://amzn.to/4ewsJpu)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

I never thought I'd reach the point in my life where I'd be excitedly unboxing a shower head like it was the latest iPhone, but here we are. The first thing that caught my attention was how substantial it felt. It's not like those flimsy plastic one that feel like they came from a dollar store's ""maybe it works?"" bin.

The package included the shower head itself, a 6-foot hose, and mounting brackets that actually looked like they meant business. The instructions were clear enough that even someone whose entire DIY experience consists of building IKEA furniture could handle it. I even installed it without having to call my dad or watch 47 YouTube videos, which is basically a personal record.

# My Favorite Features

**The pressure.** The water pressure is legitimately impressive, even in my ancient apartment building where the water pressure usually feels like it's being generated by a hamster on a wheel. 

**8 spray modes.** Having 8 options makes me feel fancy, like I'm at a spa instead of my tiny bathroom where the toilet paper roll sometimes falls into the bathtub and the cat watches judgmentally from the doorway. The rainfall setting is particularly nice.

**Anti-clog nozzles.** So far, I haven't had to do that weird vinegar-soak thing that usually turns into a whole weekend project. The nozzles are made from some material that apparently repels mineral buildup like I repel potential dates - effectively and without even trying.

**Power wash feature.** This might be my favorite part. It's like having a pressure washer built into your shower head. 

**Extra-long hose.** Six feet of hose freedom means I can finally reach those awkward spots without doing shower yoga. It's also great for washing pets, though my cat still thinks the whole process is a personal betrayal of our friendship ranking somewhere between that time I stepped on his tail and when I bought the wrong brand of cat food.

# Pros

* Installation is actually doable without a PhD in plumbing or a YouTube certification
* Water pressure makes you feel alive again (or at least awake)
* The power wash feature is basically therapy for your shower walls
* Long hose means you can finally reach every corner of your shower
* Multiple settings that actually feel different from each other 
* Built solid enough to survive my occasional clumsiness and late-night cleaning frenzies

# Cons

* Some plastic parts make me slightly nervous about longevity (though they're holding up so far)
* The switch between settings can be a bit stiff at first
* The power wash mode can be a bit too powerful if you're not ready for it
* Might make you spend too much time in the shower

# Final Thoughts

For the price, it's probably one of the best bathroom upgrades you can get. However, if you're someone who thinks a gentle mist is the height of shower luxury, or you're scared of having too many options (decision paralysis is real), maybe stick with your current setup.

**Drink frequency:** 3-4 drinks per day will typically be brewed on this setup

**Experience level:** Intermediate. Coming from using manual mode on a Breville.

**Candidates:** Pretty sure I've narrowed it down to Eureka Specialita and Rocket Appartamento TCA imported vs. Eureka Specialita, Gaggia Classic Evo Pro + upgraded portafilter if I have to buy from a U.S. vendor.

Sadly, my Breville Barista Pro stopped working after less than three years despite regular maintenance. I need a new machine and grinder. (Seriously, newbies here, don't be like me and buy a combo machine. Replacing both at the same time sucks financially.)

I saw people mention how great pricing is on Espresso Coffee Shop, an Italian site everyone seems to say it's legit. But I saw one commenter say the manufacturers don't honor warranties if you import equipment? Not a huge concern for me, but is that true? And for people who have ordered from them: What am I looking in duties if I buy $1,500-2,000 worth of equipment? It's so much cheaper that it's hard to imagine it not still being a better deal than buying from a U.S. vendor.

**Note:** I'd really like a hot water spout given how much my wife drinks Americanos and values convenience. For that reason, I'm not thrilled about a Gaggia but I don't see a ton of better options in the $1,000 and under range.

But when I'd go overboard, I'd REALLY go overboard. 

It was easy for me to look at the hundreds of times I drank without incident and had a good time and decide to disregard the blackouts and binges.

But the blackouts and binges were getting closer together, and I was beginning to worry family and friends.

So finally after many repeated attempts to not binge/blackout/bender, I decided to just hang my drinking hat up.

I lost a little bit of weight, but I eat more sweets now (never cared for them before). I still have some unhealthy vices - way too much coffee, too much social media, recently got into gaming. But my close family and friends find me highly reliable again, and I'm always present with my kids and for any disasters. Side note - there are a surprising number of disasters (small and large) that you are highly capable of handling if your brain isn't being bombarded by poison.

As a total outlook revamping, I also started to take myself more seriously. I stand up for myself more, I don't let people's emotions dictate my response to things. I also workout more consistently and have increased my focus and dedication to my business and some side projects I'm working on.

If you're reading this and thinking about taking the plunge, do it. You can always go back if you find that you don't realize the benefits, but I'd wager that if you're honest with yourself, you won't go back.

The market is tough right now, and he doesnt have a degree. He's considering going back to school -- probably for engineering of some sort. His family has money set up if he decides to go back to school to help with living expenses. 

  
I make pre-tax 140k a year based on my last tax statement. He *was* making less than 50k a year. Our rent is 3.6k (he was paying about 1600 of it), credit card bills are pretty low (I sensed some change coming and wanted to be prepared to took out some RSUs to pay down debt just in case)...live in a HCOL area so im hoping we can attempt to move in a year or so. My car payments are done in January (currently 173, 2x a month). We have 2 pets but no kids. Pets are pretty low maintenance in terms of costs, we've got their food on a recurring schedule for delivery that works and they dont have any major health issues.

  
I've got probably around 2k in personal stock investments and a LOT (like 60k+) of un-vested RSUs from work that will come my way over the course of the next 2 years. The unvested RSUs are whats keeping me feeling too sick about the long term impact of a small money period. I know anything could happen but id say im like 90% job secure at any given point in time.

  
We're already kind of homebodies, don't really drink. Our ""vices"" are probably subscription services for things like clothes (i am very attached to my monthly clothing rental, helps curb my online shopping habits and makes me feel a little better about clothing consumption), streaming services, and takeout. Takeout has already been almost entirely eliminated (however now with his free time we take a morning walk 3-4 times a week and grab a coffee). 

  
I'm not so worried about the day to day stuff, I think we'll be ok until he decides to start school or finds a part time gig. But I do know any savings I was working on will take a hit...would love to try to think of ways to either make some additional or passive income, OR simplify our current money strategy.

Not A Walk In The Park...,"[First:](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fz6zph/im_never_doing_door_to_door_sales_again/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=nosleep&utm_content=t3_1gps7bi)

[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gps7bi/im_a_contract_worker_for_a_secret_corporation/)

Bit by bit my living situation had improved. I could afford heat, at least two meals a day, and warm socks. Those comforts came at a cost. A bullet wound in my shoulder was still healing up. The company I worked for offered magic-laced medicine that could heal wounds faster, but they cost more than I could afford. Better to let things heal on their own. A deep ache from my legs bothered me. It got to the point that I knew I needed to get a checkup before working again. I hated needing to see the doctor for old wounds simply because medical costs aren’t cheap. After this check-up, I might not be able to afford heat for the rest of the colder seasons this year.  

I wasn’t certain what sort of creature Dr. Fillow was. He looked human enough. I called to see if he had any open times for an appointment, but he told me he could swing by in a few hours. He was very busy treating supernatural creatures and sometimes humans like myself. He was always on the move, so it was easier to see him outside his clinic.  

He’s been by my place three times in the past two years when my legs got too bad to deal with. The scar above the right knee looked redder than normal. My knee also felt weird. It made an unnatural creaking sound and sometimes popped out of place if I pushed myself too hard. My left leg needed to be wrapped with a special cloth. It had turned black, the darkness fading around my hip. I hated looking at the scars. I should be thankful that I was able to get my legs back, but they were a constant reminder of the day I lost the person I cared about most.   

Dr. Fillow arrived with a few months' supply of cloth for the left leg. He needed to redo some painful spell work because the magic that kept my leg attached had been weakening, when I pulled magic from other sources through my body while on the job, it had messed with the spell that attached new flesh to old.   

“I hear you’ve been working again.” He said after the treatments were finished.  

He often stayed for a few minutes to chat and get caught up. I always offered him a drink or a snack, but he refused saying he didn’t like sweet things or liked tea. Once he accepted a cup of coffee. He wore a mask over half his face and sounded as if he always had a sore throat. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever seen his full face before. He adjusted large glasses over top of his mask and brushed aside light brown hair.   

“I needed the money. I figured it was about time. I can’t seem to get any easy jobs though.” I shrugged.  

My legs hurt like hell. I dreaded the idea of staying in bed for a few more days to recover. I needed to get a job soon to pay for this treatment.  

“Don’t push yourself too hard. Paying off your debts is not worth your life. Have you found anyone to support you?” He asked looking around my barren and rundown apartment.  

“No. I figured I needed to get myself back together before I dragged a person into my mess. And with scars like these, it’s not as if I’ll find someone who would be interested in a simple fling either.”  

“No friends? Nothing of the sort?” He offered almost sounding worried about me.  

I shrugged again. I was about to tell him that August offered to work with me whenever he was free. I didn’t feel like boring him with my personal life. Or lack of one.   

“Go make some friends. Get some rest. Call me if your pain increases.” He said as he stood up ready to leave.  

This was all the advice I'd heard before. I paid what I could then mentally flinched when I saw the rest of the amount I still owed. I promised I would take it easy as the doctor left to see another one of his patients.   

I did plan on staying in bed and resting for as long as I needed. However, two days later I found myself sitting on a bench in a park ten minutes away from my apartment. A job came in saying a handful of people saw some sort of large animal and a young girl had gone missing shortly after the sightings. It wasn’t confirmed a creature had been behind these events, but The Corporation didn’t like taking chances. The park was so nearby I figured I would check it out.  

I walked over during the day looking for any kind of clues. The park led off into a short nature trail. I assumed if there was a creature it would hang out in the trees. An entire day of searching led to nothing. Since monsters came out at night, I was stuck staying up late.   

Aside from some recent graffiti, nothing appeared out of place around the park or the trial. My legs ached from all the walking. I spent a few hours sitting on a bench almost wanting for something to happen.   

I found out the hard way if I focused hard way not use my talent of seeing traces of magic after my leg treatments. The migraines I got did not mix well with the leg pain, making them both unbearable. Speaking of something unbearable, my phone kept going off because August figured out how to send GIFs. I should have blocked him. He would on occasion send a good cat gif in the mess of other memes that made it worth letting his messages go through.  

“Is your girlfriend worried about you?”  

A voice made me jump. A girl had silently walked behind the bench to see over my shoulder. She had gotten a glimpse of the random messages. I stood up to face her honestly expecting a monster. Instead, I found a petite dark-haired girl wearing a plain white dress. She even had sandals in this cold weather. She had her hands behind her back. Healing bruises spotted her arms.  She looked anywhere between sixteen and nineteen. She shouldn’t be out in a dark park at this hour without a coat. I put my phone and wallet in my pants pocket then took off my jacket. I offered it to her without hesitation.  

“Where do you live? Do you need help getting home?” I offered.  

She smiled in a way that looked very familiar. Her black hair and dimples made me think of August. She took my jacket, snuggling down into the warm collar for a moment.  

“I’m not normally the kind of girl who lets strange men take me home.” She joked in an overly sweet voice.  

“I’ll call you a cab.” I said not wanting her to get any ideas. “By chance do you have any siblings?” I added.  

She shook her head confused over the odd question.  

“No. Are you disappointed I don’t have a sister?” She suggested.  

It was as if she was trying to flirt. She was very bad at it if that was her goal.   

“No, you look like a friend of mine. Must just be the hairstyle. Now come on, let’s call a ride for you.”  

The smile on her face appeared forced. I wasn’t going along with the game she wanted to play. I started to walk down the pathway towards the park entrance with her following behind. My phone didn’t want to turn on again. Sometimes it shut off in the colder weather.  

“What are you doing out at this time of night?” I asked her as we walked.  

“Looking for monsters, how about you?” She said, her sweet tone dropping slightly.  

I froze. Carefully I turned my head towards her, my brain trying to work out if she was a threat. Some creatures looked like innocent weak humans to lure in their meals. She may be a monster ready to rip my heart out, or just a weird girl in the park because she had an interest in the occult. If I made a run for it, I risked leaving a poor girl stranded. If I didn’t leave, then I also risked getting eaten.  

I wasn’t aware of how right I was about the risk of being dinner for a creature. A burst of wind came down on us. I started to move to grab the odd girl to get her out of danger. My body was too slow. To my horror, a beast came down from the sky. In one lightning-fast movement, a black beak scooped her up around the waist. In two beats of its wings, it lifted back into the sky tossing her into the air. Her small body was swallowed whole by the monster that recently started to stalk the park.  

It was a crow the size of a car with three glowing red eyes but oddly enough, paws as legs. Like hell, I was going to let her get eaten like that. We stopped near a bench. I prayed I had enough strength to fight back in time to save her.  

Every living thing had magic. The amount depended on many different factors. I was in the middle of a park with countless plants, trees, and dormant insects all with their own life force. That magic leaked into the air. It was a reason why some forests felt so strange to humans. If you knew how you could ask to use the power nature held. Humans weren’t built to handle magic. I still made a silent request to everything around me. I put out my will to take whatever was given. I then grabbed a hold of the bench that had been bolted down into the stone walkway. A burst of power came through. I aimed for the glowing eyes in the sky and threw the bench as hard as I could towards it.   

The metal and wood found its target. I heard the impact and saw the crow fall from the sky screeching the entire way down. The backlash of using so much magic hit hard. My right knee popped out and I swore it felt as if it was going to come apart at the old scars. My arms burst with pain and my muscles cramped up. Each one of my hands curled uselessly. I forced myself forward towards the downed crow hoping it wasn’t too late to save the poor girl.  

I was in no condition to fight the monster if the bench flying into its face didn’t knock it out.  

By sheer luck, the crow was still.  

My luck turned around in seconds when an even larger crow landed behind me. I screamed into the night; red eyes angrily glowing.   

Well, shit.   

I frantically ran through my brain trying to figure out what the hell these creatures were. If you knew enough about a monster, there was a chance you could defeat it even if you were weaker. Nothing came to mind. Not a damn thing. I’ve heard of Bad Omen Crows. They were oversized crows that appeared near cursed humans with bad luck to feed off of. Aside from that, no clue on how to kill them.  

“Give me a damn break.” I said to any higher power that might be listening.  

Again, my luck turned around in a way I never would have guessed. The larger crow let out a noise over something that was happening behind me. The knocked-out bird's eyes flew open as its chest feathers budged outwards. It let out a strangled cry, then rolled on its back. My body felt cold when I saw a human shape literally rip its way through flesh, blood, and feathers. The girl stood covered in gore. Her once-white dress clinging to her and my jacket was ruined. Sharp claws hung at her side. A wide smile cracked her face in half. She shook the hair from her hair and then grabbed her blood-soaked clothing. She ripped it off to stand in the cold wearing nothing but a sports bra and shorts.   

The larger crow started to move knowing it wasn’t wise to stick around. She didn’t give it time to flee. Within seconds she was on the monster ten times her size. Claws and teeth ripping deep into the monster's body.  

I should have stayed home that night.   

I took a few steps away, the pain slowing my movements. If I was lucky, I had enough time to get out of the park before she finished the one-sided fight. I’m never lucky.   

She tackled me from behind easily knocking us bother over. I rolled on my back ready to fight back. She quickly pinned down my arms, blood dripping from her stained face.  

“Come on darling, show me what you can do! You knocked down that chicken, didn’t you? What else do you have up your sleeve?” She said her voice now lacking the fact sweetness she used before.  

She was crazy. Legit a nutcase. I’ve come across monsters that love nothing but fighting. She had acted as bait not to lure in humans to eat but for other monsters. Since I showed a hint of skill, I was now the next target.  

This wasn’t good. She took down the two crows in under two minutes. I couldn’t fight my way out of this and by the look in her eyes I couldn’t talk my way out of this either.   

“How about you let go so we’re on even terms?” I suggested praying to buy some more time.  

She let out a shrill laugh as if I told her the funniest joke in the world.   

“Fight for it!” She shouted.  

Her dimpled smile no longer appeared charming. I ran through my options. I used every ounce of strength to pull my hands free. I slipped one wrist through her fingers because of the blood on her hands. She was covered with it. Something caught my eye. Dark patches on her neck showed through the deep red. I realized she had a black ring tattoo she had hidden under some sort of makeup. The fighting and wetness had rubbed parts of it away. With one hand free and seconds to act, I reached out to grab hold of her neck.  

A burst of magic came from the spell that kept her leashed. She screamed, showing off all her sharp teeth. Her nails dug into my wrists, but I pushed forward. I couldn’t break this collar like I had with the bat monster. I could only force through one command. It hurt the both of us. White sparks of magic flew out into the grass, creating deep holes where it landed. She mentally begged me to stop what I was doing and yet I still pushed. I fought with everything to let that one request sink into the spell. Something clicked between us, and I finally pulled back. She scrambled away on all fours, hissing like a cat.  

I stayed on the ground, barely able to breathe. My hand smoked from touching so much raw magic for so long. If she wanted to finish me off, she could have.  

“What in God’s name is going on here?!” A man’s voice came as a flashlight beam landed on us.  

A set of police stood shell-shocked at what they saw in the park. Two dead birds, me and the girl who barely appeared human. I groaned hating dealing with cops. There were always so many awkward conversations and paperwork afterward. Any money The Corporation may have paid for two monster crows to be killed would be directed elsewhere. Cover-ups cost money after all.  

“April!” Another voice came.   

I knew who was running up the pathway. She saw me and gasped. The cops refused to let her get closer, which I understood. They didn’t know what was going on or if the hissing blood-covered woman was dangerous.   

“What a coincidence...” I said in a shaken voice and raised my good hand to wave at Evie.   

She worked as August’s handler. It made sense she knew more creatures on a leash. If the girl who wanted to kill me wasn’t one of them, she would know who her boss was. As it turns out, Evie was the nearest handler. When she heard, the cops get called to the same park April said she was going, her handler asked Evie to go check in just in case. She later told me she dealt with April so often that she might as well be her official contract worker. I let Evie get things sorted with the cops.   

Just as I thought, there was going to be a lot of paperwork. Soon the cleanup crew arrived to collect the bodies of the crows and to do basic medical treatments for us. April was fine. Evie and she got along well. I saw her fussing over the smaller girl as if April was a younger sister. Finally, they made their way over to where I was sitting.  

“Say you’re sorry for trying to kill him.” Evie demanded in a stern voice.  

“Sorry for trying to eat your brains.” April said not sorry at all.  

“You wanted to eat my brains?” I answered, moving slightly further away from the pair.  

“Not wanted. I was going to. Not now though. I don’t eat the brains of my friends, human or not.” April said and it made my face flush.  

“Friends? How?! When?” Evie questioned shocked over the development.  

April gave a tooth-filled smile and I wanted to die. She should have just eaten me.   

“This human messed with my collar. He could have written anything into the spell. An order to not kill him or for me to kill myself. Anything. And you know what he said? Let’s be friends.”  

Yeah, I wanted to die. Evie stared at me as if I was on the same mental level as April. She carefully took hold of the other girl who now was wrapped in a blanket one of the cleanup crews brought.  

“Just friends?” She asked very weary of my motives.  

“Just friends. She’s like, a kid.” I defended myself.  

“Oh, so we’re grooming supernatural girls now.” Evie replied hugged April tighter.  

“I’m too tired to be offended. If you think that’s the case, you’re free to keep her away from me forever. I may have forced the idea of being friends into the collar that keeps her under control, but she doesn’t need to listen to that request if she doesn’t want to.”   

I tried to stand up to start going home but my legs refused to work. I collapsed back onto the bench too drained to move.  

“You’re not ditching me that easily. You made a friend offer so you can’t back out now sucker. For now, I want to eat some of that big ass chicken. Leave your number with Evie. We’ll hang.”  

April was released so she could run over to one of the crow's bodies. She tore a good few mouthfuls off before the cleanup crew started chasing her off with threats of getting power washed.   

“I was just teasing you.” Evie admitted. “April is a handful. She’ll be hard to deal with if she decides to stick with this offer of friendship.”  

“It was either that or dead. I am currently weighing my options.”  

Why was there no such thing as an easy job? I couldn’t get home on my own. Evie requested the help of the very confused cops who stuck around. They drove me home and pressed me for some answers. I promised them things would be explained by someone else. I was not in the state for a long conversation. I got let off the hook and collapsed into bed without changing my clothing.   

I ended the night not making a dime from the job. I needed to ask Dr. Fillow back to reset my legs again because of the beating they took from the burst of magic I borrowed.   

Financial set backs were better than dead. Sometimes, only barely better than dead.   ",2,1731952088.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Hi! My ex boyfriend (23m) broke up with me (28f) about 3 weeks ago. I've been fine for a while but today I found tickets from an event we went to and I broke down crying. I do not miss him. I do not want him back. I found out some messed up stuff about him 2 days that has really helped me move on. I met this guy who seems super into me and asked me to get coffee with him at this super cute book store after I told him how much I enjoy reading. I was really excited for it but now after the melt down I had over tickets today I'm rethinking it. I do NOT want to hurt someone by going too fast into the dating world. I've been doing all the right things. Focusing on myself, working out, I even signed up for another gym because my boxing gym only does scheduled classes. I guess I'm just kinda stuck and not sure when the right time to push myself out of my comfort zone is or if I'm actually feeling sad.",2,1731952021.0,relationships,4,1.0,False
1guao47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sosofia/comments/1guao47/crest_3d_whitestrips_review_because_professional/,Crest 3D Whitestrips Review (Because professional whitening costs more than my car),"https://preview.redd.it/e5y94a2g6p1e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ea05066071b63f0c672a7d82ebcacc4d4b8efdb

I've probably spent more on coffee than my education, and my teeth are starting to show it - which led me to trying out a bunch of teeth whitening products over the years. So, here's my thoughts on the Crest 3D Whitestrips.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

First, you get this fancy LED light that makes you feel like you're about to perform dental surgery on yourself (but you're not, thankfully). The strips come individually wrapped like tiny teeth presents, and there's 40 of them - 20 for top teeth, 20 for bottom. The LED light looks like something out of a movie where the protagonist is trying to communicate with aliens through their teeth.

Apparently it's the same whitening ingredient dentists use, which made me feel slightly better about putting these strips on my teeth instead of paying for professional whitening.

Also, the packaging has that clinical-but-trying-to-be-friendly vibe, like a hospital gift shop or a dentist's waiting room that's trying too hard to be cool. 

# My Favorite Features

**LED accelerator light.** It supposedly works with the whitening ingredients to break down stains faster. I like to think of it as a tiny spotlight that's peer pressuring my teeth into being whiter. 

**Advanced seal technology.** These actually stay put, unlike those old whitening strips that would slide around like they were trying to escape. You can talk, drink water, and even judge people silently without them moving.

**""Professional grade"" whitening.** They promise 34 levels whiter teeth, which made me wonder who's counting these levels and what they do for a living. Is there a person whose job it is to sit there with a shade chart all day? Anyway, they say it's the highest level of hydrogen peroxide outside of the dentist's office, so who am I to argue. The concentration is strong enough to make a difference but not so strong that your teeth start glowing in the dark.

**Treatment schedule.** 20 days, 60 minutes per day, plus 5 minutes with the LED light. It's like a part-time job for your teeth, but with better benefits. Still, the time commitment is real - you have to really want those pearly whites. I started timing my treatments with episodes of the Office.

# Real World Performance

The first few days, you'll probably spend an unreasonable amount of time staring at your teeth in different lighting. Is that whiter? Maybe? Is this what dental dysmorphia feels like? You'll become intimately familiar with every coffee stain you've accumulated since college.

But if you stick with it, there's no denying it. It seems to work. 

# Pros

* Results are actually visible - like, had to double-check my mirror visible. We're talking maybe I should start dating again levels of confidence
* Stays on my teeth better than that relationship I thought would last forever
* The LED light makes me feel like I'm getting a professional treatment (even if I'm just sitting in my bath watching tiktok)
* Can talk and drink water while wearing them 
* Makes you feel like you're starring in your own dental makeover show

# Cons

* Sensitivity is real. Your teeth might temporarily hate you, especially if they're already sensitive. It's like they're giving you the silent treatment, but with pain.
* 60 minutes feels like an eternity when you can't have coffee. Time moves differently when you're waiting to eat or drink anything that might stain.
* You might catch yourself making weird faces in the mirror during treatment. It's like practicing for your driver's license photo, but with more drooling.

# Final Thoughts

I'd say it's a good option for anyone who: drinks coffee like it's water, has a wedding/reunion/mugshot coming up, or just wants to stop using the black and white filter on all their photos. The results are legit, and while it's not cheap, it's still cheaper than professional whitening.

Who should skip it? If you have extremely sensitive teeth (like, cry-when-you-eat-ice-cream sensitive), if you can't commit to 20 days of treatment (commitment issues are real), or if you're looking for instant results (in which case, there's always Photoshop).

I'm John, from the greatest city in the world, Chicago. With a city so big you'd think dating is easy, I wish that was the case. I’m tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard of or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

I'm pretty simple! Go out one weekend night a week with friends to shoot some pool and have a few drinks. I tend to visit coffee shops and check out record stores on weekends too. One of my favorite spots in the city is this 95 year old theater. It’s like my escape! However, I'm also good at being a coach potato on a weekend if it's needed.

I love all kinds of music. Mainly older things like Beatles, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, I could go on and on. I'm definitely a bit of an old soul. 70s and 80s rock, 90s stuff and of course good old emo music from the 2000s

I use to do a lot of comedy in the city. Would write my own sketch shows and produce/be in them. Some of the best times of my life. I'm currently working on a short horror movie script to hopefully film and enter in film fest next year. I'm a creative guy. Guarantee l'd find us the best dates.

I'm looking for my other half at this point. Someone who can push me to be the best version of myself, and someone I can do the same for. Someone who I can laugh with, take trips with and just enjoy the little things.
Shoot me a message if you're interested. I’m looking forward to getting to know you! ",2,1731951917.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Now with that being said, I may have made a mistake by making a candle inside of a glass tea cup that belong to my late great grandmother

Obviously we weren’t going to get rid of the teacup, & we don’t have a whole tea set, it’s literally just alone glass teacup with a very detailed floral design

I thought it would be okay to make a candle inside it, so after asking my mother, that’s what I did

It was just fine for a while, but then when the candles started getting really low, the handle cracked

My mother and I don’t know if it’s from heat or if the teacup hit something that we don’t know of, we don’t know how the handle cracked, but if it’s from the heat, I don’t want to damage the cup further by making another candle in it. It’s very dear to my mother, given it belonged to her grandmother whom she was very close with, & mom trusted me to not break it because she knows I take care of my possessions ",1,1731951822.0,candlemaking,2,1.0,False

I have a really close friend who we’ve been friends since high school. Good influence etc. she has a lot of family trauma/trauma because of it. It transcended to friendship issues which I was dragged into (her mutual was toxic) and it caused such a huge issue for a good 4 years of my life. 
This year I gave her an ultimatum that I couldn’t continue my friendship with her if she carried on being around people like that, because of how much toxicity and issues It causes for  so many years. 
She’s speaking to people for marriage, and is considering someone who does not fulfil most of her requirements but is considering it because is worried that she won’t find a partner (she has found searching difficult) 
The hurtful part is that she’s considering someone who has said she would not be able to leave the house and only can have friends to her house or 
that he’ll take her to her friends. She wouldn’t be able to go out the house clothes shopping for example without him. This is something we’ve done ever since high school, we always go on coffee dates and excursions. 

I’m worried that her mentality would rub off on me. And that I may also start viewing Allah like that and choose men that are not god for me.

Is it fair to distance myself from someone like this? I’m thinking the religion does say  you are on the religion of your companions. 
Or do I need to be a better friend and stick out. Knowing that our  relationship will change after she gets married and it would hurt?",1,1731951812.0,SomaliRelationships,0,1.0,False

Thanks for you time and expertise

It ranked very well on coffee machines which it had stopped selling. Though it was ranking as good as top 3, sales was bad and it requires alot of work to run a showroom and handle the repairs. 

The coffee bean business was introduced five years ago. Sales improved pretty well initially but everything has gone stagnant.

We have/had plans together for Thanksgiving, and he knows I'm choosing to stay with him in FL rather than fly to my family in CA (last time I MENTIONED wanting to visit my brother on the other coast without him, he had a complete meltdown, keeping me up til 7 AM on vacation).

Yesterday morning, we had plans to hit the tennis courts early. I made a big mug of coffee for us to share while he walked the dogs. We're still coming off a big blowout on a boat last Saturday, and this is another stupid attempt to spend time together. There is no eye contact, and he's driving us out of the parking garage - smooth so far. Just barely left our block, and I stupidly asked him to make convo: ""Did you end up watching the \[Tyson\] fight? I was so tired. Did you wake me up?""

Lo and behold, at 830AM (which is super early for us late risers), I'm sipping the coffee and making eye contact with all black. ""WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY?"" In panic, I calmly said, ""I can't do this anymore; please take us back home"" (foolish, I know). My punishment then became screaming and yelling about a set-up and how I needed to get the fuck out this week. I always fucking do this, I am so much drama. I woke him up for this 🫡 This 44 y/o man *actually* fucking believes this.   
  
We get back inside the apartment, and I immediately put in headphones from the bed and try my hardest to absorb my brain into my laptop and ignore him, slamming doors in and out of the bedroom and yelling random shit. ""I'm going to my mom's today so you can get out quickly this week."" Me: OK. ""I'm no longer spending Thanksgiving with you; I'm going to my family."" OK. ""Am I loading the washer right?"" No, I'll help you (shoot me please).  
  
BRUHHHHH Why the fuck is he so fucking emotionally needy? It took me SO long to get here, but I feel so strong now. I finally realized and believe he legit cannot function without sucking from me. He needs the supply someway, somehow, so over the summer, my energy quickly shifted from trying to work out the relationship to grieving the person I thought he was. He literally cannot control his own emotions but uses his energy to control my actions, opinions, and thoughts (or tries lol).  
  
I was completely expecting him to blow up sometime this weekend to ruin the Thanksgiving plans, so I have flights on hold to be with my family anyway. I made the plans with him only because I needed until the end of the month. There has not been a holiday, vacation, or any day of importance that we haven't fought. I am SO fucking embarrassed, literally having hotel security called on us at a popular luxury resort in the Bahamas for MULTIPLE YEARS bc he drinks when he gambles, then takes it out on me; I finally stopped going 2 years ago and he stepped it up to any hotel we travel to.  
  
I've gone through the stages; I have already grieved the idea of marriage and the relationship, and I'm currently between yellow and gray rocking while I get my shit together (with secret plans to move out while he's on a work trip in Dec). I've never been married, and although I have always wanted to, that dream with him died in April this year when I first discovered narcissism. I'm trying my best to focus on myself and this next (exciting) step I'm going to take, but I can't help but question myself and fear back tracking, if and when he hoovers. 

Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read my story, and I'm sorry it's everywhere. I am planning on posting an update if he tries to hoover and/or if I end up flying to the other coast over the next 2 days 🩷",1,1731951470.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

I recently found a [table that I think is really cool](https://imgur.com/a/SHfGHFC), despite it being in pretty poor shape. Having carried it home through the city, I am fairly confident it is solid wood all throughout, since it was pretty heavy. Clearly a quality piece of furniture that has seen a lot of use and maybe not enough love lately.

I was contemplating taking off the rest of the black veneer, sanding it smooth again and then staining the wood underneath to use this as a new coffee table, should it wind up looking ok. I was just wondering if this community had any tips on best practices or advice with restoring pieces like this, especially with the top being veneer and the pretty heavy damage it has in it's current state.

I do 80% of the childcare and half the housekeeping. He pays for a housekeeper to come once a week and we just try and maintain what the housekeeper does. He cooks twice a week and is responsible for his own breakfast and lunch, unless he decides to make a big batch of whatever he’s making for the entire family. He is responsible for cleaning his office and his man shed, and picking up after himself. He cleans his own bedroom and bathroom. Our marriage is healthy and happy, we just like sleeping separately. He works from home about half the time and has an easy corporate job he loves. 

Lately he finds himself somehow incapable of doing anything besides work unless I prompt him. I must apparently tell him exactly what I need him to do, how to do it and when he should do it. Multiple times. He’s asked for a chore chart. 

I’m not fucking doing that. 

Now he can’t wake up with his alarm. He can’t make coffee for himself he’s too busy. He doesn’t have time to make dinner or clean. Literally nothing about his life has changed he’s just just suddenly a helpless baby???? 

He then says that most women are happy to help their husband and give simple reminders. That he “lets me stay home” and he’s just asking for a little help. 

He’s not asking for a little help, he’s asking me to hold his hand during totally normal and simple tasks he’s suddenly incapable of. No he’s not sick nor has his personality changed. He just went to the doctor for a checkup and he’s healthy and a little chubby. Work is easy and enjoyable because he’s a nepo baby who has never struggled in his life. 

Sorry I’m ranting. 

He thinks that I should clean his room, bathroom and man shed, or at least “help him do it””. Babe, the kids and I have never stepped foot in those spaces. Like that is literally all your mess Sir. Why would I clean it? He says because we are partners and I said yes, that’s why we divide communal and children things. 

Mind you, he wanted another baby. I had a hysterectomy and he got snipped. So we got a surrogate, all at his urging. Love new baby to pieces but like buddy you asked for this. 

Now he’s saying that women love organizing and helping and making sure life runs smoothly. 

No we don’t. We are just used to it so we don’t live in chaos. If your shed and room and bathroom are gross that doesn’t so a damn thing to me. Be as nasty as you like, just don’t give us bugs.

I ate the bagel and no it didn’t taste weird, but I’m more concerned because I ate 2 of them. (I went back for another bagel on my lunch break)
The 1st bagel I ate I only used (hand sanitizer) to clean my hands but this was (before I started working, touching anything, etc).
My second bagel I washed my hands so I figured I was good but still took extra precaution (I did this by using the paper wrapped in the bagel to act as a shield I guess).
Bagels are eaten, coffees are drunken and I continue with my shift. I didn’t feel any discomfort until I got home.. started to feel a little nauseous so I took a poop and a shower and thought it was over. Pooped about 2 more times then felt like the vomit was trying to come out but I just swallowed and it went away.

Am wondering if there are any women on this subreddit who found themselves in really difficult situations and managed to climb out of them and become happier, more successful and more fulfilled in their 50s. If so, how did you do it? What changed your life for the better?

I lost my mom to an aggressive form of cancer 17 years ago and my dad to another aggressive form of cancer just last year. The grief is still weighing heavily on me and I have been dealing with a lot of other things on top of that, such as having to leave behind my longtime family home and moving to a house I didn’t want to buy in the first place due to an unpleasant family situation. I unfortunately have been the target of a lot of verbal and emotional abuse by my older sister and my older brother all but ignores me and has little empathy or compassion for me. When I try to reach out or ask if I can come visit the family for a little bit, he’s either unavailable and never responds or I get brushed off.  

I also have been searching for a job without success - I was not working during my dad’s illness and haven’t been able to find anything since he passed - and I am getting really worried about my future. I have a degree and 20-plus years of experience in my field, but cannot even land a part-time minimum wage position. I’ve done everything possible in terms of trying to find work - job boards, staffing agencies, contacting companies directly, reaching out to old friends/colleagues, visting with a career counselor at my state employment office, polishing my resume and tailoring it to specific job posts, etc. - but nothing is working.

Add to that, I am dreadfully lonely. I have no husband/partner, no children and the few friends I *do* have are much like my brother - never available and terrible about responding. I’m always the one reaching out and asking if anyone would like to go grab a coffee, go walking or some other activity, but no one seems to want or have the time to do any of those things. I‘ve tried different activities (groups, ballet classes, volunteer work, etc.) in an effort to get out there and meet other people, but haven had much luck doing that, either. Everyone there already seems to have established groups of friends and I always end up on the sidelines.

My only bit of respite or relief from everything weighing on me right now is visiting with a grief counselor, but that’s only an hour a week or every two weeks depending on her schedule, so I have a lot of time on my own to think/overthink and feel lonely. Sometimes I get so lonely that I will think of a reason to go to the grocery store just so I am around other people. Or, I will get in the car and drive around just so I am out and about.

Apologies for the long vent, but I am just feeling stuck, lonely and very unhappy right now. I try to force myself to be hopeful and positive about the future, but given my situation at the moment, when nothing seems to be going right, that’s a pretty tall order.

Yesterday, in a thread that has now been locked, some folks expressed a grief that I want to acknowledge.

One commenter wrote that: “Isolation has made life not seem worth living for me.”

Another shared that: “I struggle to find reasons to want to carry on.”

Firstly, to those folks specifically, and to those who may be feeling the same: I am so sorry. It is so painful to be in that place – I know it all too well. I see that you received messages of support in the thread and I am sure others have reached out to you privately. I am also certain that there are people in your life, beyond this subreddit, who care for you and love you. You can rely on those networks of support. You are loved. I know that, for myself, it can be difficult to pick up the phone and ask for help, or just for a chat, especially when I need it the most. But I am always glad that I did.

For me, I have also greatly benefited from psychiatric treatment – so that I do not feel that darkness, which you have so vividly described, anymore. It’s not a solution for everyone, but a simple pill can really work wonders… It took a long time for me to seek treatment, but I am so fortunate that I did. I don’t think I’d still be here otherwise.

Yesterday, one commenter wrote: “COVID has pushed many of us into a way of living that isn’t healthy, but the alternative isn’t good either. What kind of choice is loneliness and isolation vs severe illness, disability, or death?”

I believe this is a profound question which deserves to be thoughtfully addressed by this community.

I have not seen any discussion within the ZeroCovid community about the health outcomes of the loneliness and isolation which these commentors have so achingly described. I wanted to share with this community [a report](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf), published last year by the U.S. Surgeon General’s office, titled “Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation.”

Like many in the ZeroCovid community, I am very distrustful of the U.S. government to say the least, and am highly skeptical of any report or statement published by any government official, about anything, public health most definitely included. However, in this case, the report is heavily cited to peer-reviewed medical research.

It is a lengthy document but the findings are summarized in the introductory section which begins on page 8. There is one paragraph in particular which stood out to me. It reads:

“The lack of social connection poses a significant risk for individual health and longevity. Loneliness and social isolation increase the risk for premature death by 26% and 29% respectively. More broadly, lacking social connection can increase the risk for premature death as much as smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day. In addition, poor or insufficient social connection is associated with increased risk of disease, including a 29% increased risk of heart disease and a 32% increased risk of stroke. Furthermore, it is associated with increased risk for anxiety, depression, and dementia. Additionally, the lack of social connection may increase susceptibility to viruses and respiratory illness.” 

To those who still isolate: I want to suggest that it may be worth factoring these statistics into your health risk analysis, if you have not already.  I understand – thanks largely to this subreddit – the very real possibility of long-term illness and disability associated with a COVID infection. But I do think it’s possible – at least worth considering -- that the certain, demonstrable harm caused by the loneliness and isolation described here may outweigh the risk of measurable harm due to COVID infection.

To amplify what I’ve heard from other voices on here: there are alternatives to total isolation. Masking is not perfect, as I have learned. But it is a strong mitigation, and can greatly expand one’s ability to form community, or just to more regularly experience the emotional connection that we can find even in the smallest interactions, even with a stranger – in the grocery store, when ordering a coffee to drink outdoors, whatever it is – it can be meaningful just to look another human in the eyes, and even more meaningful to see a person’s face – not hidden, not masked, but a face – to see their whole smile, and let them see yours, or to see their whole sadness, and let them see yours… This is the beauty and foundation of our experience as humans sharing time on this planet. 

I will leave it there, but to all: Please consider and know that you are loved.",1,1731950586.0,ZeroCovidCommunity,1,0.53,False

What is an ergonomic chair? Well, it's more than just a fancy seat! As someone who spent way too many hours hunched over my desk, I can tell you that finding the right chair changed my work life. In this blog post, we'll dive deep into how these chairs are designed to support our bodies, prevent pain, and promote better posture. I'll share my personal journey with ergonomic seating, some hilarious mishaps I encountered along the way, and helpful tips on choosing the right chair for you. Spoiler alert: your back will thank you!
  
  
## The Anatomy of an Ergonomic Chair

When I first started hunting for an ergonomic chair, I thought, “How hard can it be? It’s just a chair, right?” Oh, how wrong I was. The sheer number of adjustable parts and features was overwhelming. But once I understood the anatomy of an ergonomic chair, things started to click. Let me break it down for you, so you don’t end up staring at product descriptions like I did. 

First, there’s the **seat height adjustment**. You want your feet flat on the floor, thighs parallel to it, and knees at a 90-degree angle. Sounds simple, but finding a chair that goes low enough for my short legs? A challenge. Then there’s the **lumbar support**, which cradles your lower back. Some chairs have adjustable lumbar pads; others just have a built-in curve. I once sat in a chair with “universal lumbar support,” and let’s just say my back didn’t feel universally supported. Customization is key. 

Now, the **armrests**. They should move up, down, and ideally swivel a bit. I had one chair with armrests so wide apart that I felt like a toddler on a throne. And let’s not forget the **backrest tilt**. You need it to recline but also lock into place so you’re not wobbling like you’re on a carnival ride.

It’s funny now, but learning these features taught me that an ergonomic chair isn’t one-size-fits-all. It’s a tool you customize for _you_.

## My Journey: From Desk Potato to Chair Connoisseur

My transformation from a dedicated desk potato to a full-blown chair connoisseur began with an embarrassingly simple realization: my back hated me. There I was, hunched over like a human shrimp, twisted up like a pretzel, and shifting positions every ten minutes just to dodge the inevitable ache. You'd think I'd been auditioning for a Cirque du Soleil contortionist act the way I folded myself in my worn-out, creaky chair. Spoiler alert—it wasn’t a good look.

I tried everything. First, there was the makeshift lumbar support, which was really just a rolled-up towel that gradually slipped until it resembled a sad burrito. Next, I experimented with sitting on exercise balls—terrible idea. Sure, bouncing might burn calories, but it mostly made me look like a fidgety toddler. I even tried stacking pillows, but that just felt like a slow-motion avalanche of cotton.

Enter: my first ergonomic chair. It was love at first… sit? Well, not exactly. I was skeptical—mainly because the contraption looked like it belonged on a spaceship, with adjustable armrests, a curvy backrest, and a seat that slid back and forth like a see-saw. I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to sit on it or pilot it.

But once I got the hang of it, things started to change. I played around with the settings: adjusted the lumbar support (a real one this time!), found the perfect tilt, and even managed to look a little less like the Hunchback of Notre Desk. My spine practically sighed with relief. Sure, there was a brief period where I kept fiddling with the chair’s mechanics, but once it was set, it was like sinking into a cloud—but, you know, a supportive cloud that wouldn't let me slump over.

Now, every time I hear someone complain about their back, I can't help but chime in with, “Have you met my ergonomic chair?” Trust me, I know I’m a little much, but I also know that feeling of finally ditching the discomfort.

## Why Posture Matters More Than You Think

So, let’s talk about posture. You know, that thing your grandma always nagged you about. Turns out, she had a point. Poor posture isn’t just about looking like a question mark in family photos; it’s a full-blown health hazard. Sitting slumped over for hours, especially if you’re glued to a screen, can silently sabotage your back, neck, and even your productivity.

Here’s what I’ve learned the hard way: bad posture is sneaky. At first, it’s just a little ache between your shoulders or a stiff neck after a long day. Then, bam! One day you’re googling “why does my spine hate me” at 2 a.m. because the pain won’t quit. Chronic slouching can lead to muscle imbalances, reduced lung capacity, and even digestive issues. It’s like your body is keeping score—and trust me, you don’t want to lose this game.

The good news? You can fix it, starting with an ergonomic chair. These marvels of modern design support your spine’s natural curves. To sit correctly, plant your feet flat on the ground and adjust the chair so your knees are at a 90-degree angle. Keep your back against the chair, and resist the urge to lean forward like you’re solving a mystery on your laptop. Trust me, it’s life-changing.

Good posture isn’t just about avoiding pain; it’s about feeling strong and focused. Sit smarter, and your back (and productivity) will thank you.

## Finding Your Perfect Fit: It’s Like Dating

Shopping for the perfect ergonomic chair is, honestly, a lot like dating. You’re out there, looking for ""the one"" that’ll support you, treat you right, and make life a little less painful—literally. But oh boy, let me tell you, not every chair deserves your back. Some are all style, no substance. Others seem great at first but turn into a literal pain in the… well, everywhere. 

When I first started looking for my dream chair, I was clueless. I walked into a store, plopped down on the first chair that caught my eye, and thought, ""This is it!"" Spoiler alert: it wasn’t. After a week of sitting in it, my lower back felt like it had been in a wrestling match. I’d fallen for looks, not compatibility. Rookie mistake.

Here’s what I learned: you _have_ to test drive. Sit in the chair for a while. Adjust it. Lean back. Pretend you’re scrolling through emails or doom-scrolling social media. Does it cradle your back? Support your arms? If it doesn’t feel like a match after five minutes, trust me, it’s not getting better. And beware of the cheap thrills. That budget chair might save you money now, but you’ll be paying for it with chiropractor bills later.

Finding the right ergonomic chair takes patience. Try a few, listen to your body, and don’t settle. Your back deserves a partner that’s in it for the long haul.

## The Science Behind Comfort: What Studies Say

The ergonomic chair, to put it simply, is like that one friend who always has your back—literally. But what does ""ergonomic"" even mean? At its core, it’s all about creating something that works _with_ your body, not against it. These chairs are designed to support you where you need it most, which, as it turns out, is everywhere: your spine, your shoulders, your neck, even your wrists. If you’ve ever slumped in a chair and felt like you aged 20 years just trying to stand up, you’ll know why this is so important.

An ergonomic chair doesn’t just happen by accident; it’s the result of careful design. Think adjustable armrests, lumbar support that hugs your lower back, and seats that don’t feel like medieval torture devices. Each feature has a purpose. For instance, that little knob to adjust the seat height? It’s there to make sure your feet are flat on the floor, keeping your blood circulation in check. And the recline function? Turns out, a slight backward tilt reduces pressure on your spine. Who knew?

What really blew my mind was learning how these chairs are built with _movement_ in mind. They encourage you to shift positions subtly throughout the day. That’s right, no more guilt for fidgeting—it’s actually good for you! When you think about it, an ergonomic chair isn’t just furniture; it’s a tiny, silent health coach, whispering, “Sit better, feel better.” And honestly, who doesn’t need a pep talk like that every now and then?

## Your Ergonomic Chair: Maintenance and Beyond

Let’s talk about taking care of your ergonomic chair, because, believe me, it deserves some TLC. I learned this the hard way when my once-perfect chair started squeaking louder than my dog’s chew toy. It’s not just about keeping it clean—though, yes, crumbs and coffee spills should go somewhere _other_ than the crevices of your seat. Maintenance goes beyond surface-level care. 

First, let’s tackle the moving parts. Over time, the mechanisms that let you adjust the chair height or recline can stiffen up. A little silicone spray or light machine oil on the joints can work wonders. I remember thinking my chair was broken when the backrest got stuck mid-recline. Turns out, it just needed lubrication. Simple, right? But it’s the kind of “oops” moment you only experience once. 

Next up: those wheels. If you’re rolling across carpet with hair and dust tangled around the casters, it’s no wonder your chair feels sluggish. Pop the wheels off (yes, they’re removable!), pull out the gunk, and you’ll be zipping around like it’s a new chair. 

And hey, don’t forget the upholstery. Whether it’s mesh or faux leather, regular cleaning keeps it looking sharp. I use a soft cloth and mild soap for mine—it’s oddly satisfying watching years of grime disappear. 

Bottom line? A little upkeep here and there saves you from shelling out for a new chair sooner than you’d like. Plus, a well-maintained chair means your back stays happy, and that’s the whole point, isn’t it?

## Conclusions
  
  
In conclusion, choosing the right ergonomic chair can be the difference between a comfortable workday and a backache nightmare. From my own misadventures, I learned that it’s all about finding that sweet spot—one that supports your posture without making you feel like you're sitting on a cloud of marshmallows. Whether you're working from home or in an office, investing in a quality ergonomic chair pays off in both comfort and health. Remember, your body deserves the best! So, before you grab that old chair from the back of the closet, take a moment to consider what works for you.

I took this regularly for approx 6 months . 
The side effects that I noticed initially were sleepiness and grogginess the next morning for half the day . Coffee helped mitigate the grogginess . I stopped taking it once my nerve pain subsided and noticed that I felt aggitated and like my skin was crawling for about one week after stopping . Was not instructed to taper off by my Dr - so stopped cold turkey . 
 Fast forward to 2.5 years later and was having trouble sleeping due to stress and was out of my normal Tylenol PM so “borrowed “ some gabapentin from my husband ( he takes it for nerve pain due to an accident/ major surgery  he had 6 months ago - 300 mg ) . I continued to take the gabapentin over the course of 2 weeks thinking it was helping with stress and sleep issues - which it was helping . Simultaneously though I started having sudden onset debilitating tinnitus . As well jaw pain , neck pain and shoulder pain and anxiety and dizziness / vertigo . I thought the source of the tinnitus was caused by jaw grinding and the neck pain / shoulder pain a result of the jaw grinding ( TMJ does cause neck and shoulder pain ) . Also discussed the uptick in anxiety with my Dr . Asked to have the gabapentin re prescribed because I thought it would help with the jaw grinding etc and the anxiety. 
Skip forward 6 weeks later and had been absolutely leveled by anxiety and still grinding my jaw . Tinnitus going strong . Decided to stop taking all medications , vitamins , protein shakes etc to see if I could determine the cause of the anxiety / tinnitus/ jaw grinding and they a process of elimination have determined that it was the gabapentin that has been causing all of these issues !  Now after one week of not taking gabapentin my tinnitus is slowly backing off , anxiety is gone and jaw grinding gone . I looked up side effects of gabapentin and have now learned thru researching on Google and on Reddit that these are known potential side effects of gabapentin !

Whether you’re aiming for government, in-house, big law or otherwise, these short, fast-paced, first-round interviews are often your first opportunity to make an impression. 

So with that in mind, here’s what you need to know to prepare like a pro.

# What Are Screener Interviews?

**Screener interviews are short, typically 20-30 minute interviews (but they can be as short as 10-15) that serve as a first-round filter for jobs.** This can either happen independently of the traditional recruiting process or it can be part of recruiting events like OCI (On-Campus Interviews) or regional job fairs. 

**Think of them as professional speed dating:** firms and jobs want to assess whether you’re a good fit for their culture, your enthusiasm for their practice, and your ability to hold a polished, professional conversation.

If you perform well during your screener, you’ll likely receive a callback interview—a longer, more in-depth meeting with multiple attorneys at the firm/org. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves––I’ll post a guide on that in the coming weeks. 

If you want to know a bit about what to expect in the hiring timeline, there's a guide on that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/s/lsoH3J8Fus).

So let’s focus on nailing the screener first.

# Before the Interview

1. **Research the firm. Brownie points––network BEFORE you get in the room.**

This step can’t be overstated: show up knowing who you’re talking to and show that you can already fit in comfortably with the culture.

**Practice Areas:** What are the firm’s specialties? Even if you’re unsure about your long-term focus, mention areas that interest you.

**Office Strengths:** If you’re interviewing with a specific office, understand its key practice areas or clients.

**Firm Culture:** This is always a tough one but this is where networking ahead of time can go such a long way.  

# 1a) Networking to Talk About Firm Culture: Leveraging Connections During Screener Interviews

I want to talk about this section in depth specifically for a second because I think people sometimes misunderstand what you really do with this nebulous thing called networking. 

Networking isn’t just for the job search—it can also play a key role during screener interviews. **If you’ve already built connections with people at the firm (through coffee chats, alumni events, firm-hosted receptions, or whatever), this is your chance to strategically weave those into the conversation.**

# How to Bring Up Your Networks

Mentioning your connections (in a genuine and natural way) shows that you’ve done your homework and are genuinely interested in the firm. Here’s how to do it seamlessly:

**Name-Drop Naturally:** If you’ve spoken with someone at the firm, mention what you learned from them. For example:“I had the chance to speak with \[Networked Person’s Name\] recently, and they shared how much mentorship was a priority in the litigation group. That really stood out to me because I know how much I value building long term connections with my mentors. I’d love to know about your experience with your mentors here.”

**Highlight Insights:** Use your conversations to demonstrate deeper knowledge of the firm. For instance:“I heard from \[Networked Person’s Name\] that associates at this office often take the lead on \[X PRACTICE AREA\] cases. I am very interested in that practice and would love to hear about your experience with how those teams get structured for cases/deals like that in this office.”

# What If You Don’t Have a Connection?

No worries! Many candidates don’t. Instead, you can mention the firm’s reputation or reference specific events you’ve attended, such as their info sessions or diversity panels. For example:

“I attended the firm’s reception at \[Law School\], and it was clear how much emphasis you place on mentorship for junior associates. That aligns with what I’m looking for in my career.” Etc. etc. You get the idea. 

# Network Responsibly

While mentioning your connections can be impactful, don’t overdo it. Avoid coming across as though you’re name-dropping just for the sake of it. Use your networks to reinforce your genuine interest and knowledge about the firm, but **focus the conversation on your qualifications and fit.**

# Before the Screener: Build Your Network

If you haven’t already reached out to alumni or attorneys at firms you’re interested in, it’s not too late! Send polite, concise LinkedIn messages or emails to learn more about their experiences. In fact, your school likely has an alumni email list you can ask your career services for to get contact info of folks who currently work at those firms, and who have already consented to talk to current students. 

**In sum, networking early and mentioning how those networks helped you validate the culture of the firm/org is how you actually talk about culture and fit and prove that you are already a good match for that.** This really goes a long way when firms/orgs have to differentiate between hundreds of very qualified students. 

Now back to the screener!

# 2. Prepare Your Answers

You’ll need to answer common questions confidently. I have a list I’ve written in depth of basically every question I’ve ever heard asked in an interview prep guide I built that I’m happy to share–feel free to DM me if you want it. But here’s a couple you should have in your back pocket cold:

* **“Why this firm?”:** Tie your answer to specific aspects of the firm’s culture or practice areas. Again, networks are an easy way to say “The people make the difference, and here’s who made a difference for me.”
* **“Tell me about yourself.”:** Have a concise, polished response that connects your background (law school, internships) to your interest in the firm.
* **Behavioral Questions:** Prepare stories highlighting teamwork, problem-solving, or resilience using the **STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)**.

# 3. Prepare Questions for Them

Have a few thoughtful questions ready for the end of the interview. **In particular, avoid questions you could easily answer with a Google search.**

**If it helps,** [**here’s a guide with a series of questions you can ask to show you did your homework on the firm.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1fazahq/questions_to_ask_in_an_ociscreenercallback/)

# 4. Polish Your Resume

Your interviewer may have only 2 minutes to skim your resume before speaking with you. Make sure it’s clean, professional, and highlights your experiences. 

**In particular, highlight research, writing, and analysis skills. This is your biggest value add as a brand new future attorney. Hammer that home as much as possible.** 

**Brownie points**: If you had a standout internship, think about how to discuss it in 1-2 compelling sentences that you can bring up in the screener. 

# During the Interview

# 1. First Impressions Matter

* Dress the part (business formal unless explicitly told otherwise).
* Make strong eye contact, smile, and deliver a confident handshake if in person. If it’s over zoom/a phone call, speak confidently, look into the camera, and make sure your space looks professional and clean.
* **Bonus:** [Here’s a guide on the things that firms judge a candidate on](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1et28fv/a_guide_what_interviewers_at_a_firm_judge_a/) (like literally in the pieces of paper they have to write the review of you on after the interview)

# 2. Stay Engaged

**Remember, this is a conversation, not an interrogation.** Show interest in the interviewer’s questions, and don’t be afraid to let your personality shine.

The goal is to convey that you’re smart, hardworking, and someone they’d want to work with for the days that go sideways and you have to work with these people for 12 hours straight.

# 3. Be Concise and Clear

With limited time, don’t ramble. Answer questions directly and transition smoothly to the next topic.

**💡 Pro Tip: If you feel yourself going off on a tangent, pause, and wrap up with a clear takeaway. Don’t be afraid of a pregnant pause.**

# 4. Highlight Your Experiences

Don’t just list what you did during internships—show how your work is relevant. For example:

Instead of saying, “I worked at XYZ place,” try: “At XYZ place, I drafted legal memos analyzing \[specific issue\], which helped the firm decide how to approach \[specific outcome\].” Brownie points if you can weave in specific issues and tasks that are relevant to the org you’re applying to, i.e., “By drafting memos on X issue at Y place, I was able to better understand how \[XYZ process\] works in this practice area.”

# 5. End on a High Note

Thank the interviewer and express genuine enthusiasm for the firm. A simple “I’m really excited about the opportunity to work with your team” goes a long way.

# After the Interview

# 1. Send a Thank-You Email

**Within 24 hours, send a concise, polite thank-you note.** Mention something specific from the conversation to personalize it—so, if you need, you can take a couple bullet point notes during the interview to refresh your memory later when you need to write this. 

# 2. Reflect on Your Performance

This is often overlooked. Take 5 minutes to think about or jot down what went well and what could improve. This will help you refine your approach for future interviews. **You’ll probably do more of these than you can count, and just like exercise, you can work and focus on getting a little bit better each time.** 

# Common Pitfalls to Avoid

* **Failing to Prepare:** Winging it is not an option. Even just a little bit of prep can really save you when an interview asks something as simple as “why us?”
* **Overloading the Interviewer:** Don’t try to cram your entire life story into 30 minutes. It’ll come off as rambly and if you make everything seem important, nothing is important. Right now, your job is to highlight the best of what you’ve done, not narrate your biography.
* **Being Too Generic:** Tailor your answers to the firm and interviewer. I promise you, they have countless students who are doing the “spray and pray” method of trying to get offers, and showing you’ve been even a little thoughtful about your application (often networking is a really easy way to do this!), you’ll immediately pop up to the top of the pack when they consider all their candidates.

# Final Thoughts

Screener interviews can feel overwhelming, but preparation is the key to confidence. Research the firm, know your story, and practice presenting yourself as a professional with purpose. 

**And remember—your goal is to get the callback, not land the job on the spot.**

I am completely new to this and I don’t know where to start and I’m scared. At times I feel my life doesn’t have the structure to maintain the consistency needed to fix this.

I have a 4 year old with ASD who doesn’t have a regular sleep schedule. He receives ABA therapy at home on top of weekly therapy sessions out the house. I have a 9 month old and I just finished breastfeeding. My life is very stressful. I asked my doctor if stress is also a factor in pre-diabetes and she said no. I have to find ways to exercise in the house without disturbing my kids. 

While I was nursing I noticed an increase in appetite and sugar cravings. My partner works over 16 hours a day and by the time he comes home it’s late. I eat usually only one solid meal a day very late and I admit it’s usually quick either fast food or a frozen meal. I’m a huge meat eater. I snack mostly during the day. Nuts or chips. My 4 year old is a such a picky eater so while I make sure he eats healthy I usually don’t eat any of the food he does eat so I can make sure it’s enough for him as his options are limited. I’m at home with the kids majority of the week and then on the weekends I work as a crisis counselor where I run off of a large iced coffee and a donut all day.

I love cooking. I don’t mind finding new foods and healthier recipes that I would like. I don’t want to completely lose the foods I enjoy but I am willing to lower my intake of the “bad” things.

1gu9re8,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1gu9re8/why_are_you_only_applying_to_remote_jobs/,"""Why Are You Only Applying to Remote Jobs?""","I wrote this in reply to another comment, but felt perhaps it may be prudent as its own post. I am going to be succinct, direct, and blunt as to why I, and many others in similar circumstances, are looking for remote-only jobs, as it seems the prevailing consensus is that remote jobs are the choice of the lazy. (And apologies to the mods that there may be little humor herein, though perhaps the darkest, bitter-black coffee notes of the resigned may carry through for those of a similar palate.)

I would do in-person jobs if I could. There are places hiring out here, though it is the ""off"" season (Eco-Tourism Hellscape, USA.) However,

- The nearest store is nine miles away. 
- Public transport is not a thing here. 
- I do not have a vehicle or a license because on the road, my health conditions would make me a hazard to other drivers, ~~and also, it's fifty fuckin' dollars to get one out here.~~ 
- I have no living relatives or local friends who could assist me in showing up for an on-site job, 
- and even if I were able to manage that, the physical aspects of such a job would only cause me physical harm, 
- to say nothing of the fact that my mental health isn't really geared for the extremely people-heavy jobs that are available in my area, either. 

I have done physical in-person jobs, and the fact of the matter is that I will make it about six months or so before the toll of having to get ready every day, leave my house and travel, and having to deal with people all day- on top of unreliable schedules and all the other shit one faces when doing retail or fast food (the only jobs here even if you have a degree or trade experience, with the sole exception of The Mines), makes my brain decide that life, as it is currently, is no longer worth living. 

I am speaking bluntly because I hear this constantly: isn't it better to have *any* job than no job, at least to pay your bills, at least to keep surviving? And the answer is, if those jobs were accessible to me and all those in similar circumstances, ***we would fucking be doing those jobs.*** That we are applying to remote positions en masse, ""spamming them"", is to try and survive in a world where the value of a human life is measured in its capital output, and not the worth of its humanity. Laziness has nothing to do with it: this is a matter of circumstance and a consequence of putting profits over people, no matter how high piles the human toll. 

I would like to stress that this is not simply an issue of mental health! My mental health matters are largely well-managed, I'm a grown adult in my thirties with quite a lot of lived experiences, therapy, and medication in these bones. But the world we inhabit is geared in such a way that it makes living untenable for the lot of us due to our circumstances, and blames us for being born into them in the first place. There is the constant subtle insinuation that if we only worked a * little* harder and compromised a* little* more, our problems wouldn't persist: conveniently ignoring that for many of us, simply continuing to *eat, shit, and breathe* is more of an ordeal than most office jobs ever will be. 

I do not need much to survive. The cost of living here is low, noticeably low, because no one wants to live here. I live in a home that probably should be condemned as it slowly falls in around me, I eat simply, I have stretched my savings out for about two years now. I have some side gigs I do, temporary contract work, and I am grateful for it- but it's not reliable and it's not enough most of the time to pay my exceptionally small bills. You could keep a horse boarded and stabled for less than it costs to keep me alive on a monthly basis. And yet!

I'm going to sell some bonds we got in the 90s to make it through the next few months. I keep applying to jobs- resume tailored, individualized for each job, bespoke cover letter, rest assured I have done more work applying to jobs than I have done when I actually have the damn job. No idea how I'll pay my taxes in 2025; no idea how I'll pay for food come spring. ~~(Candidly? I'd do sex work if the population density supported it, but alas. In either case I'm selling my body for someone else's use, so it's hardly any more demoralizing than retail, and given that my area has one of the lowest minimum wages in the country, *the pay would honestly be better.*)~~

That is to say: I would do any work available to me, if it would allow me to survive. But unfortunately, the options for me (and for so many like me) are as limited as the survival chances of the *vaquita*: assumed to be extinct directly because of society putting profits over the value of a singular, irreplaceable life.

(Funny. That almost seems to be a leitmotif for the state of society. Probly just a coincidence.)

**TL;DR:** jobhunting while disabled is a funny joke and buddy if we could work in-person jobs without it literally killing us, we would be! In an ideal world disability benefits would be accessible and livable for those who need to receive them, but instead we live in a clown society.

I exclusively drink iced lattes from my local coffee place or Starbucks. So to recreate that all I need to know are the best settings on this machine to make a double or triple espresso shot that I will then add milk,ice and flavored syrup to. 

Ive read through this sub quite a lot doing research and I’m confused about the Doppio+ feature which seems like what would be best. Or is it better just to hit the single shot button 2 or 3 times in a row? Does that change the taste? What would you all recommend for the best way to make my drink?

Nestled between rolling hills and a serene lake, the town was known for its quaint charm and a single, magical bookstore that drew visitors from miles around.

She had heard whispers of this place from fellow travelers—a bookstore that was more than just a store. It was a gateway to other worlds, a place where the stories leaped off the pages and into reality. With a mix of curiosity and weariness, she stepped inside, the little bell above the door announcing her arrival.

The interior was cozy, with shelves that seemed to stretch endlessly, filled with books of every genre and age. Soft, golden light filtered through the dust motes, casting a warm glow over the room. She was greeted by the owner, an elderly man with twinkling eyes and a knowing smile.

""Welcome, traveler,"" he said. ""I think I have just the thing for you.""

He handed her an ancient, leather-bound book. As she opened it, she felt a strange sensation, like stepping into another world. The words shimmered on the page, and she found herself transported into the story, living the adventures alongside the characters.

In this enchanted bookstore, she discovered that each book offered a new journey, a new life to explore. She could be a brave knight in a medieval tale, a cunning detective in a noir mystery, or a star-crossed lover in a tragic romance. The possibilities were endless, and each night she spent in the town brought a new adventure.

But it wasn't just the books that captivated her. The town itself was full of intriguing characters—the mysterious librarian who seemed to know more than she let on, the charming barista who made the best coffee she'd ever tasted, and the gruff but kind-hearted blacksmith who had stories of his own.

As the days turned into weeks, she found herself drawn deeper into the magic of the town and its people. She began to wonder if she could stay here forever, living a thousand lives through the pages of the enchanted books.

Looking to explore this magical setting with someone who can bring their own character and story into the mix. Whether it's a slice-of-life tale or something with a touch of fantasy, I'm open to all ideas. Let's create a story together in this enchanting little town..

We've had little arguments but pretty much just the standard roommate stuff.

I work overnights at a hospital and have a small collection of to go mugs that I use for coffee.

Two were particularly special to me: 
One cost about $200 from a cafe near us. 
It's from their coffee club and it gives you ""free"" unlimited coffee refills as long as you bring in your cup. 
I used it a lot on workdays when I don't want to make coffee.
I also had one that a friend made for me in their pottery class.

I noticed that over time, my mugs were going missing. I started with a collection of maybe 10 and was down to a couple. 
Neither of my ""favorites"" could be found.

I have adhd and I'm not the best at keeping track of things, but im usually pretty good about keeping track of things like the $200 mug. 
My anxiety usually overrides the adhd and there's no way I forget stuff like that at work or in a public place.

I asked my roommate if she could check in her car for any of my to go mugs.
She often would bring something like a mug to work with her and leave it in her car.
Were both kind of a mess like that.

She snapped at me and said that she didn't use my mugs.
I was a little surprised and confused that she got so defensive. 
I wasnt accusing her of anything, just thought maybe she brought them with her somewhere and might have understandably left them in her car.
I explained that to her and asked if she would take a look next time she's in her car anyways, that maybe she had forgotten and it wouldn't hurt to just double check.

Fast forward a few months.

I'm in the basement looking for an empty box for donation items.

I see one labeled with my roommates name.
I go to see if it's empty or has something in it when I get a whiff of this terrible smell. 

Usually I wouldn't open a box with her name on it, but good God, what is that smell?

I open it up and it's my entire mug collection.
Everything is covered in mold and old... coffee? Hot chocolate? No idea, doesn't matter.

I didn't say anything, just put the mugs in the kitchen sink with some vinegar to soak them.

When I wake up the next night, I see that they have all been ""cleaned"" by my roommate. 
Some were not recoverable, like one with a French press built in and the mug my friend made.

The French press one was also expensive for me and a gift from my dad.

The one from my friend had some nooks and crannys that mold stuck and it wasn't really clean - able.

I also just didn't feel comfy drinking out of a lot of them.

I threw the ones I didn't think were usable away, and roomie got mad. She said that me throwing the mugs away was dramatic and wasteful.

I never confronted her about gaslighting me and hiding the mugs....

At least, it was until one afternoon.

I was sitting on the couch with my son, watching random educational videos on YouTube. He’s six, full of energy, and obsessed with learning videos. He wants to know everything about everything. It was nice. Just the two of us hanging out, him curled up next to me, asking a million questions.

Then it came on. The upbeat jingle, and that cheerful, sing-songy voice. School House Rock. “Three is a magic number, yes, it is, it's a magic number, somewhere in the ancient mystic trinity, you get three as a magic number…”

My chest tightened immediately, like a fist had closed around my heart. I froze. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. That song, that melody, it reached deep into my brain and pulled out something I didn’t even know was there. The memories hit me like a freight train.

“Daddy?” My son’s voice was distant, muffled, like I was underwater. “You okay?”

I blinked and realized I was staring at the TV, my hand clenched so tightly around the arm of the couch that my knuckles were white. My son was looking up at me, his face scrunched in confusion.

“I... ” I started to say something, anything to brush it off, but my throat felt like sandpaper.

“Daddy?” he said again.

“I’m fine,” I lied, forcing my hand to let go of the couch. “I just... need to run to the bathroom.”

I stood up, nearly tripping over the coffee table as I made my way to the bathroom. My legs felt weak, my whole body trembling. I gripped the edge of the sink, trying to steady myself.

The song was still playing in the living room, that stupid, happy voice echoing in my head.

*3, 6, 9,12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27...30*

It wasn’t just a song. It was the song. The one they played to calm us down.

When I was a child, I went to Crestwood Middle School. The school was large, but very old. It had poor insulation, making it freezing in the winter, and hot in the summer. No matter how much they tried to paint the place, it always looked outdated. The hallways echoed; the floors creaked. Hell, most of the faculty had been students there themselves as children.

The rules were strict, and the teachers didn’t mess around. Dress codes, assigned seats at lunch, even how we walked in the hallways was monitored. It felt like every corner of the school was under their watchful eyes, even when you couldn’t see them.

Most of the staff at Crestwood were all about rules and discipline. They acted like they were running a military academy instead of an elementary school. But my favorite teacher, Ms. Harper, was different.

 She was warm, playful, like she actually liked kids. While the other teachers scowled and barked orders, she’d crack jokes and smile. She wore colorful dresses that swished when she walked, and her room always smelled clean, unlike the rest of the school, which smelled more like old books, old wood, and mildew.

Everyone loved her. She was the one teacher who made me feel safe at that school. She’d ask about our hobbies, encourage me to draw or write stories, and even kept a stash of candy in her desk for when we did well on tests.

But despite the safety of Ms. Harper’s classroom, us kids couldn’t help but feel uneasy at Crestwood. Maybe it was just the age of the school, maybe it was the rules. Or maybe, it was the rumors. Every kid in the school had heard them. Stories about kids disappearing, about strange noises in the vents, about the principal supposedly eating kids who misbehaved. It all sounded ridiculous, but at Crestwood, the line between “weird” and “normal” was thinner than at most schools.

My best friend at the time was a kid named Alex. He was small for his age, with messy hair and a laugh that was contagious. We bonded over many things, Pokémon cards, PlayStation 2, but it was our shared obsession with urban legends that really fueled our friendship, and Crestwood was full of them. Whenever we heard a new one, we’d go off on “missions” to investigate them. Most of the time, it was harmless fun; investigating the “haunted” bathroom, or trying to sneak into the teachers’ lounge. But one day, we heard a new rumor. There was a hidden basement under the school.

Over the next couple weeks, Alex and I started asking around about the basement rumor to the 8^(th) graders. According to the stories, it was where the teachers took “the bad kids.” No one knew what happened down there. Some said that is where Principal Johnson eats kids, some said its haunted, or there was some kind of monster that lived down there. But one thing was certain. The kids who’d gone missing over the years? Supposedly, that’s where they ended up.

Alex was obsessed with the idea. “We have to find it,” he told me one afternoon.

“I don’t know, man,” I said, kicking a rock across the cracked blacktop. “What if we get caught, or what if the rumors are true, and *we* go missing?”

He shot back, his eyes wide with excitement. “But what if we’re the ones who finally figure it out? We’d be legends!”

I wasn’t as enthusiastic as he was, but I went along with it anyway. It was hard to say no to Alex once he got an idea in his head. It didn’t hurt that he was my only friend.

That afternoon, after the final bell rang, we didn’t head straight home. Instead, we stayed behind, hiding in the bushes until the coast was clear.

“Okay,” Alex whispered, peeking out. “Now’s our chance.”

We slipped back into the building through a side door that never quite latched properly. The halls were silent. Just being in the school while it was empty was unsettling enough by itself.

“Where do we even start?” I whispered.

Alex pointed down the hallway toward the janitor’s closet. “Mark said it’s somewhere near there.” Mark was a 8th grader, the loud and obnoxious kind. I didn’t trust him, but Alex did.

We crept down the hall, our sneakers squeaking softly on the floor. The janitor’s closet was locked, as expected, but Alex had come prepared. He pulled an old, expired credit card from his pocket he had gotten from his parents and started fiddling with the door.

“Do you even know what you’re doing?” I muttered, glancing nervously over my shoulder.

“Shut up and keep watch,” he hissed.

It only took him a few minutes to get the door open. I was about to congratulate him when I saw the look on his face.

“Uh... dude?”

I turned to see what he was looking at. Inside the closet, behind the rows of cleaning supplies and buckets, there was a small door.

Neither of us said anything for a moment.

“So... do we open it?” Alex asked, his voice trembling just a little.

I wanted to say no. Every instinct in my body was screaming at me to get out of there. But Alex was already reaching for the latch.

Alex pulled the door open, revealing a narrow, dark hallway.

“Whoa...” Alex said, his voice barely above a whisper.

The walls were old brick, and the floor was plain, cracked concrete. The only light came from the janitor’s closet, spilling weakly into the space. At the far end of the hallway was an olde wooden door with a padlock dangling from its latch.

“Okay, it’s locked. Let’s go,” I said, my voice shaky.

But Alex wasn’t listening. He was already going down the hallway.

“Alex!” I hissed, glancing over my shoulder toward the main hall. “Come on, man, this is stupid! We’re gonna get caught!”

“Nobody’s even here,” Alex said, his voice echoing slightly off the cold walls. “It’s fine. Just come on.”

I hesitated, my heart hammering in my chest. The silence in the school was oppressive, my heart was beating out of my chest, but I couldn’t leave Alex there alone. With a sigh, I went after him, the cold stale air of the hallway hitting me like a slap.

Alex stood at the far end of the hallway, staring at the padlocked door. He reached out and jiggled the lock.

“It’s old,” he said. “I bet we could break it.”

“Or,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, “we could leave. Right now. This is crazy, Alex. We’ll get in so much trouble.”

Alex ignored me. He turned back toward the janitor’s closet and climbed up. For a split second, I felt relief, thinking he was giving up. Then I heard the scrape of metal.

“What are you doing?” I called out.

Alex came back into view, struggling to carry a red fire extinguisher. “If we can’t pick it, we’ll just smash it.”

“Are you serious?” I said, panic rising in my voice. “That’s gonna be so loud!”

“So what? Nobody’s here,” he said, grinning. “Relax, dude.”

Before I could argue, he hoisted the extinguisher and swung it at the padlock.

Clang!

The sound was deafening in the tiny hallway. I flinched, glancing up at the door, fully expecting someone to come storming in.

“Alex, stop!” I hissed. “We’re gonna get caught!”

But Alex just shook his head. “One more, and it’ll break.”

He raised the extinguisher again and brought it down with all his strength. The lock gave way, clattering to the ground.

“There,” Alex said triumphantly, dropping the fire extinguisher with a thud. “See? Told you it’d be fine.”

I wanted to scream at him, to beg him to leave, but he was already reaching for the handle.

“Alex-” I started, but it was too late. He pulled the door open.

Alex pulled the door open, and both of us leaned forward, holding our breath as we peered into whatever was on the other side.

Behind the door, there it was.

A set of old stone steps, worn smooth in the center, descended into pitch blackness. The air that wafted out was damp and stale, carrying a faint, sour smell that made my throat feel tight. There was no light down there, just stairs descending into a dark abyss.

Alex, who had been so full of bravado a moment ago, froze. I could feel his confidence drain out of him like air from a punctured balloon.

“Uh...” he said, his voice shaky for the first time.

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. I just stood there, staring at those stairs, my body cold and rigid.

“Okay,” Alex finally said, his voice an awkward mix of forced confidence and creeping fear. “It’s... it’s just stairs. Probably, like... storage or something, right?”

I didn’t answer.

Alex looked at me, his expression changed from fear, to half a grin. “Come on, dude. Don’t wimp out on me now.”

“I’m not wimping out,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “I just… I mean what if there’s someone down there? What if the rumors are true?”

“There’s no one here!” he said, a little too loudly, like he was trying to convince himself more than me. “The whole school’s empty. It’s fine.”

Neither of us moved. But I couldn’t shake the feeling we were being watched.

“Look,” Alex finally said, swallowing hard. “I’ll go first. You just... stay close, okay?”

I wanted to tell him no. I wanted to grab him and drag him back, out of the hallway, out of the school, back into the safety of the sunlight. But I didn’t. Instead, I nodded.

Alex took a shaky breath and stepped forward, his sneaker scuffing against the edge of the first step.

Just as Alex was about to step onto the first stair, we both heard it. A faint sound, almost melodic, coming down the hallway. Whistling.

I froze, my heart slamming against my ribs.

“Crap, the janitor!” I urged to Alex.

Alex turned to look at me, his eyes wide. His hand instinctively reached for mine, like we were about to get caught doing something we couldn’t explain.

I quietly scrambled back up the hallway, silently closing the door inside the closet, praying it wouldn’t make a noise. We pressed ourselves against the brick walls of the hallway, barely breathing. The whistling was getting closer, and I could hear the shuffle of heavy boots on the floor, and the jingling of the janitor’s keys.

We could hear him digging through the janitor’s closet, getting his cleaning supplies. I could hear him humming a tune, something old and off-key, as he worked.

My pulse was racing. I felt like my skin was vibrating with anxiety.

We waited in the dark hallway, holding our breath, not daring to make a sound. The whistling grew louder, then softer again as the janitor started moving further down the hall. I could hear him muttering to himself now, probably complaining about some mess he had to clean up. Then, finally, the sound of his footsteps faded into the distance, and we were left with nothing but silence and the darkness of the hallway.

When the coast was clear, I breathed a sigh of relief. Alex and I let go of each other, not realizing we had been grasping onto each other in the darkness. When we finally left the closet back out into the light, Alex was pale, his eyes wide, and I could tell he was just as freaked out as I was.

“Okay,” I whispered. “We need to leave. Now.”

Alex didn’t argue. He just nodded quickly, his mind already scrambling to process what had almost happened. We snuck back out of the school, our breath heavy. I couldn’t shake the image of the stairs, the darkness below, but we didn’t talk about it. Not yet.

We made it out of the school without anyone noticing, and as soon as we were outside, the evening air felt like an instant relief. Alex and I started the walk to our houses.

Alex was the first to speak. “So, we proved it,” he said, his voice a little shaky but excited.

I nodded slowly, my adrenaline still rushing through me. “Yeah... we did.”

We both stood there for a moment, the weight of what we’d found settling in.

“I knew it,” Alex said with a grin, “it’s real. The basement. Dude, I can't wait to tell everyone. We’re going back. Next time, we bring equipment. Flashlights, cameras... everything.”

I was hesitant at first, the fear from earlier still lingering in the pit of my stomach. But as Alex spoke, something else started to creep in. Excitement.

We both paused for a moment, looking at each other, before erupting in cheers and high fives.

The next day, we came prepared. Flashlights, a camera, snacks. Everything we thought a good mission should have. We spent the morning rehearsing what we’d say if anyone caught us. We were ready.

After school ended, we hung back, waiting in the bushes again. When the coast was finally clear, we snuck back into the school, just like we did the day before.

We reached the janitor’s closet, and Alex, with his usual bravado, yanked the door open.

But before either of us could move, a hand shot out from behind us, gripping my shoulder like a vice.

I froze. My heart stopped cold in my chest.

""Going somewhere?"" The voice was low, gravelly.

I whipped around to see the principal standing there, his face twisted in anger, his eyes sharp with menace. In his hand, he held the broken lock from the basement door.

For a split second, my mind went blank. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t move. All of our planned responses went out the window.

Alex was the first to break the silence. He stammered, his voice high-pitched with fear. ""Please... don’t eat us.""

I glanced at him, my stomach sinking. There was no time to process it. He stood there, looming over us, his anger palpable.

I opened my mouth to apologize, but nothing came out. All I could manage was a breathless, “Sorry... we weren’t going to do anything.”

The principal stared at us for what felt like an eternity. His eyes were filled with a dangerous look of authority. But then, just like that, his expression softened.

He let out a harsh chuckle. “Eat you? Haha... no, no, I’m not going to eat you.” He shook his head, almost amused.

I felt my body start to relax, but the unease didn’t go away. Not completely.

“You two better get out of here,” the principal continued. “And don’t let me catch you doing something like this again.”

We didn’t argue. We didn’t even say anything. We just nodded, backing away slowly. I glanced over my shoulder as we turned to leave. When I looked back, the principal was still standing there, staring at us, like a predator watching its prey. It wasn’t a look of concern or disapproval. It was something else, something darker, more dangerous.

I had a feeling that he knew exactly what we’d been up to. That he had been watching us all along.

I went home that night, expecting a call home to my parents. I kept checking the phone, waiting for it to ring, but nothing came. No call. No angry voice telling me I was in trouble.

The next day, I went to school with a pit in my stomach. Every minute felt like I was waiting for the other shoe to drop. I kept looking over my shoulder, half-expecting to see the principal or one of the teachers waiting to pull me aside. But nothing happened. The day passed normally, almost too normally.

But as I walked through the halls, I started to notice it; the teachers, all of them, seemed to be watching me. Not in the usual way, like when they were making sure I was paying attention. No, this was different. Their eyes followed me more intently, like they were keeping track of my every move.

It made my skin crawl. I tried to shake it off, but I couldn’t. It felt like I was the center of attention, and not in a good way. Every time I looked up, one of them was watching me, their gaze colder than it should’ve been.

I had to talk to someone. There was only one teacher I trusted, Ms. Harper. She was always kind to me, always listened when I needed her. I’d always felt safe around her, like she was the only one who didn’t treat me like just another student. So, during lunch, I made my way to her classroom.

“Ms. Harper?” I said, standing in the doorway.

She looked up from her desk, her usual warm smile softening when she saw the look on my face. “Yes, honey?”

I hesitated. I wasn’t sure where to even start. How could I explain everything?

“I... I need to tell you something,” I said, voice trembling. “Something happened. Something’s not right here.”

She motioned for me to come in, and I stepped inside, my heart pounding.

I told her everything, the basement, Alex, the principal. How we’d found the hidden door and almost gotten caught, how the principal had known what we were up to. I even told her about how the teachers had been watching me, like they knew something I didn’t.

When I finished, there was a long silence. Ms. Harper didn’t say anything for a moment, just stared at me, her face unreadable.

She smiled, that warm, reassuring smile she always had. ""It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. I’ll take care of it, okay? You don’t have to worry. Everything will be fine and I won’t let anything happen to you or Alex.""

She reached into her desk drawer, pulling out a piece of candy. She handed it to me, her eyes soft with what looked like genuine care. ""Here, candy makes everything feel better,” she laughed, her voice gentle.

I trusted her. She was the one person at this school who’d always been kind to me, always made me feel safe. I unwrapped it and popped it into my mouth.

Immediately, I felt a strange sensation wash over me. My mouth turned dry, my head a little foggy. A heaviness settled in my chest, and the world around me began to blur at the edges. My legs felt weak, my balance off. I reached out for the desk to steady myself, but it felt like the room was tilting.

I blinked, trying to focus. ""Ms. Harper..."" I whispered, my voice barely a sound.

She was sitting there, still smiling. And then, the darkness started to close in.

My vision tunneled, everything going black around the edges, the room fading into shadows. I tried to take a step, tried to keep my feet under me, but my body wouldn’t listen.

The last thing I saw before everything went dark was her smile.

I woke with a jolt, my breath sharp and shallow. My body ached all over, and my head throbbed. I was sitting upright in an old wooden chair. My arms were tied to the back of it.

I panicked, pulling against them, but they wouldn’t budge. I tried to shout, but my throat was dry. My mouth tasted like something foul, and for a moment, all I could do was sit there, taking in the world around me, trying to understand what had happened.

The room was cold, and the walls were made of rough, old stone, chipped and cracked as if they had been standing for centuries. The air smelled of dust and mildew. There were shelves lining the walls, stacked high with old books, the titles unreadable. Other things sat on the shelves too: strange jars with unidentifiable contents, faded photographs, and other old knick-knacks.

In front of me, there was a small, old table with an even older TV on it. The screen was dark for now, but I couldn’t help but stare at it, dread rising in my chest. What was this place? Why was I here? Why was I tied to this chair?

Then next to me, I noticed someone else there. Alex was tied to a chair next to me. I began to understand why I was there, and I knew then exactly where we were. The basement.

He was sitting next to me, slumped over, still unconscious. His wrists were bound to the chair just like mine, and his head lolled forward. I tried to get his attention. “Alex,” I rasped, my voice weak and hoarse. “Alex, wake up.”

But there was no response. He didn’t stir. He was breathing softy, like he was sleeping peacefully.

Panic surged through me again. I jerked against the ropes, trying to loosen them, to get free. I had to get out of here. Whatever they had brought us down here for, it wasn’t good. I began to sob, thinking of my parents.

The door creaked open. I froze, and my breath caught in my throat. It was Ms. Harper.

She walked into the room, calm as ever, her movements graceful, like she didn’t have a care in the world. Her soft smile never faltered as she came toward me, the same smile she always wore in class. The one that made you feel safe, like you were in good hands.

But now, in this place, that smile didn’t feel like reassurance. It just felt wrong.

“Hey there,” she said, her voice sweet, almost sing-song. “You’re awake. That’s good. You’re going to be just fine.”

I swallowed, my heart racing. “Ms. Harper... what’s going on? Why did you do this? What’s happening?”

She didn’t seem in any rush to answer. She just continued to smile, her eyes soft and kind.

“It’s okay,” she said, her voice gentle. “It’ll all be over soon. You don’t have to worry.”

My mind reeled, my thoughts scrambled, but I couldn’t think of anything else to ask. Nothing that would make sense. My eyes kept flickering between Alex and the door, trying to find an escape, trying to piece together how I’d gotten here.

Ms. Harper leaned down, brushing a stray lock of hair from my face. “You’re nervous, aren’t you?” she asked, her voice warm, soothing. “It’s okay. I understand. It’s hard, but it won’t be for much longer.”

“Here,” she said as the flicked on the TV and turned on the VCR. “Watch some cartoons while you wait. It’ll help calm you down.”

And then the screen on the TV flickered to life. The familiar song of Schoolhouse Rock began to play, its upbeat melody grating against the cold silence that had settled around me. I hadn't heard it since elementary school. 

“Three... is a magic number...”

I tried to turn to Alex, tried to wake him, but he didn’t respond. His head hung limp against the chair, his chest rising and falling with shallow breaths.

The song played on, and the numbers rang out one by one, each one a nail in the coffin of my sanity. “Three... six... nine... twelve... fifteen... eighteen... twenty-one... twenty-four... twenty-seven...”

My thoughts raced with the melody of the song.

“... thirty...”

And then the door opened again.

Several figures entered, their forms draped in dark, flowing robes. They moved silently, gliding across the room like shadows.

They came toward me, and I tried to scream, tried to struggle, but my body wouldn’t obey. They untied me from the chair with ease, their hands cold and impersonal.

I was too weak to fight back, too dizzy to scream.

They dragged me and Alex out of the room. We made our way down the hall, past flickering oil lamps hanging along the walls. I begged them to let me go. My voice was weak, barely a whisper, but I couldn't stop myself. ""Please,"" I pleaded, my throat raw, ""please, let me go... I don’t know what’s happening. I won’t tell anyone, I swear.""

But they didn’t respond. Their faces were hidden by the hoods of their robes, and they didn’t even slow down. They just kept dragging me, my feet scraping against the cold stone floor, my body too weak to do anything but stumble along. Alex was still unconscious, his body limp as they pulled him alongside me.

I tried to look around, to find something, anything, that could explain this.

We moved through a narrow hallway, lit by flickering oil lamps, and into a large room. It felt like stepping into a nightmare. The air was thick with the scent of incense, heavy and suffocating, and the walls were adorned with grotesque carvings and strange symbols I didn’t recognize. But it was the center of the room that made my stomach drop.

There was a pool in the middle of the floor, but not a pool of water. It was dark, black as midnight, and the liquid inside shimmered, almost like oil. The faint smell that emanated from it made me gag.

At the far end of the room, there was an altar. A massive stone slab, its surface covered in something I couldn’t identify. Around the altar, skulls and horns of different animals were mounted on the walls, arranged in sickening patterns. Some of them were small, others large, their hollow eyes staring out at me with a dead, unblinking gaze. The place felt ancient.

But it was the symbol above the altar that sent a chill racing down my spine. It was carved into the wood, twisted and warped. I couldn’t make out all the details, but the shape of it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I knew, deep down, that whatever it was, it wasn’t something meant to be seen.

They dragged me to the center of the room. My knees hit the cold stone with a sickening thud, the impact sending a jolt through my already battered body. I couldn’t keep myself upright. My head was swimming, and everything felt distant, like I was barely tethered to reality.

Alex was still out, his body slumped in a heap beside me. I wanted to reach out to him, shake him awake, but my hands wouldn’t move.

The figures who had dragged us in were standing in a perfect circle around us. The only sound was the soft, steady rhythm of their chanting. I couldn’t understand the words. They weren’t in any language I knew, but it didn’t matter. The sound was enough to send a deep, primal fear racing through my chest.

And then, the chanting stopped.

A figure stepped forward. They were taller than the others, their robe a deep crimson that caught the dim light from the oil lamps. They reached up and pulled back their hood, revealing a face I would never forget.

It was the principal. One by one, the figures removed their hoods, revealing the faces everyone I had known as my teachers. The faculty, the entire faculty, even the lunch lady, was there.

I wanted to scream, but my voice was gone. My body trembled, the terror crawling through every part of me.

""Please… let us go,"" I managed to choke out, but my words were nothing more than a whisper in the thick silence. ""Please, don’t do this.""

But the principal just stood there, his eyes cold and unreadable. ""This is necessary,"" he said. ""It’s been written. It’s time.""

I wanted to close my eyes, to block it all out, but I couldn’t. I was trapped. There was nowhere to run, no way to escape. The chanting started again, this time louder, rising in intensity, until it felt like it was vibrating the walls themselves.

Alex finally stirred, his eyes fluttering open, a mix of confusion and fear on his face. He tried to sit up, mumbling something, his voice slurred and groggy.

The figures, now a tight circle around us, closed in even closer, their movements silent but purposeful. Alex tried to struggle against the hands that held him, his voice rising in panic. “Where are we? What’s happening? Let me go!”

But no one responded. The chanting grew louder, more insistent, the sound echoing off the cold stone walls. I felt the grip on my own arms tighten.

Alex broke down, tears streaming down his face. “Please, please, let me go,” he sobbed, his body trembling violently.

One of the figures holding me let go. They turned their full attention to Alex, and the rest of the group moved in closer. I could barely see Alex’s face through my own tears.

“No!” I shouted, fighting against the last figure holding me, trying to reach him, but it was too late. The faculty members, those twisted, hooded figures, grabbed him, holding him down.

“Wait!” I cried, desperation twisting my voice. “Please, let him go! We didn’t do anything!”

But they didn’t respond. One of them reached out and grabbed Alex by the arms, dragging him forward. Alex was screaming now, his voice a desperate, tortured sound that echoed through the room. “No, no, no!”

And then, they threw him into the pool.

Alex emerged once, gasping for air, his face covered in the thick, black substance. His scream was a gargled, terrifying sound, almost inhuman, before he sank back under the surface. The figures continued their chanting, their voices blending into a low, ominous hum.

I fought harder against the hands holding me, thrashing and kicking, anything to get to Alex. “Stop!” I screamed; my voice hoarse. “Please, stop!”

But they ignored me, their focus completely on Alex and the black pool.

I took my chance. The figure holding me was distracted, their eyes locked on the others. I bit down hard on their hand, feeling the warm, metallic taste of blood fill my mouth as I tore away. The figure cursed, reeling back, and I pushed off with all my strength, throwing myself forward.

I ran, my heart pounding, my legs moving on instinct. I didn’t know where I was going, didn’t care. I just had to get out of there, away from the chanting, away from them and that room.

I heard a shout, the sound of robes rustling as they pursued me, but I didn’t look back. The air in my lungs burned with each breath, my body aching as I crashed through the door and out into the hallway. I ran down the hallway, past the oil lamps, and back up the stars. I burst out of the janitor’s closet, and I didn’t stop until I was outside into the cold night air.

I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. All I could do was run.

I finally made it home, my body shaking from the cold night air, my mind racing a hundred miles an hour. As I got to my driveway, I saw the police car parked outside.

When I walked through the door, my parents were waiting for me, both of them standing in the living room with tense expressions. My mother’s face was pale, her hands wringing in front of her, and my father stood next to her, looking at me like I was some kind of criminal.

“Where have you been?” my mom demanded, her voice sharp. “Do you know how worried we’ve been? The police have been looking for you!” I didn’t even care about the questions. All I cared about was what had happened to Alex, what I had seen, what I had barely escaped.

“What happened?” my dad asked, though there was a coldness to his voice that didn’t make sense. He was acting as if he was more annoyed than concerned.

I told them everything; the basement, Alex, the figures, the chanting, the pool. I expected some kind of reaction from my parents. Some kind of urgency. But their faces were surprisingly blank.

But before I could say anything more, one of the officers who had been standing in the corner of the room, keeping a distance, stepped forward. He was tall, his uniform neatly pressed.

“We’ll take care of it,” he said, giving me a brief nod. He turned to my parents. “We’ll look into it. Don’t worry. We’ll get to the bottom of this.”

The officer didn’t say anything more, but when he glanced at me one last time, I caught it. That subtle shift in his expression, that look that told me everything I needed to know. He knew. He knew exactly what had happened, and he was a part of it. I could feel it in my bones, the sick realization crawling through me like something cold and dark. He wasn’t here to help. He was here to protect the truth.

I felt like I was suffocating. My throat went dry, and the weight of everything, the faculty, the police, my parents, crushed down on me all at once. I began to question everything, every little detail. Did my parents know? Were they involved too? The way they stood there, their eyes darting around nervously, I wasn’t sure anymore. Maybe they were complicit, maybe they had been protecting me all these years, keeping me blind to the truth.

I couldn’t trust them. Not anymore. That night, as I lay in my bed, my thoughts spinning in circles, I knew what I had to do. I couldn’t stay here. I couldn’t stay in this town, surrounded by lies, by people who were part of something so much worse than I could ever have imagined. I knew it’d be just a matter of time before they finished the job.

I packed a bag, grabbed what little I had, and without a word to anyone, I slipped out of the house. I didn’t leave a note, didn’t say goodbye. I couldn’t. There was no one to trust anymore. I knew that cult, or whatever they were, would get me if I stayed, it was only a matter of time.

I ran, my heart pounding in my chest, my feet pounding against the pavement as I made my way down the empty street, away from my house, away from everything I had ever known. As I disappeared into the night, I knew one thing for sure: I would never return home. Not now, not ever.

I stood there, staring at my reflection in the bathroom mirror, my face pale, my eyes hollow. The memory, the horrors, they were all crashed back to me at once. I could hear the faint echo of *3 is a Magic Number* still ringing in my ears, though it had long since faded from the screen.

Splashing cold water onto my face, I tried to snap myself out of it. I leaned over the sink, my hands gripping the edge. I couldn’t help but wonder what had happened to me? And what had happened to Alex?

Bringing myself back to the present, I left the bathroom, my son waiting for me outside. “You feel better, Daddy?” he asked. “Yeah, I’ll be okay. Hey, let’s go grab some ice cream, buddy” I said.

Leaving the house, my neighbor Nick was outside, trimming his bushes. “Hey neighbor!”

I gave him a wave. But as I got in my car, I couldn’t help but notice something. He was watching me still. Holding his shears, his smile faded, and he was looking at me, with that familiar, knowing look.  ",9,1731949050.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Prices as per local options outside of USA,"Hi, I live in a place where good coffee machines are hard to come by, and cost an arm and a limb when they do (e.g. the prices in the title). My current Delonghi is on its death bed (group head leakages of all sorts, not a portafilter gasket issue), so I figured it would be a good time to find an upgrade.

I have two extremes of options available that I can purchase locally. 

The first option is a Gaggia Classic Evo Pro - which thankfully won't need the 12 to 9 bar pressure fix, but is otherwise limited in what options I have available locally for modding and improving it.

The second option is a Lelit PL62 Mara V2 which hopefully won't need many modifications, but comes at a significantly steeper price.

I'd like your opinions on which option to go for in terms of workflow (I have a great grinder and have been roasting my own beans for 8 years, those parts are covered), reliability and longevity (parts and services are hard to come by in my country, so I'd prefer a machine that doesn't break down as easily or isn't a super pain to maintain 5 years down the line), and long-term satisfaction.

Which of these two would you suggest is a better ""forever"" option? Is the jump to a Mara worth it from a GCP? And is either a good enough built machine to last a decade? My usual usage at home is 4 shots daily, if that counts, and I use RO water with TDS under 50.",2,1731948964.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Hi all,

I bought a no-burn steam arm replacement for my Silvia Pro X (from Chris Coffee), and I have tried to do the swap myself, but I cannot remove the current steam arm (stock). I have tried to unscrew it using the proper wrench size and with some good leverage, but it did not bulged at all. I have not try to ""impact"" it by hitting the wrench with a with hammer (like you do to loosen tight bolts on your car ie), as I do not want to start breaking things in there. I have removed all panels, etc.. but I cannot get that thing off for the life of me ;(

Any tricks I should try before I contact a local coffee machine service center and pay them to do it?

Thanks!

UPDATE: I will not be able to remove that nut directly on the machine, so looking at putting the whole valve assembly in a vice. Would anybody know how to pull the wand + valve assembly on Pro X?

There is a nut that we need to loosen, but there is a no way that a wrench can work there - you can not rock it to loosen the nut - there is no play. Last option would be to disconnect the two-hose connection to the brew boiler ;(

I have added a picture of the problem. Thanks!

Regular #1: Will be in the store literally all day every day, idk how he affords it. He’s old and will move the chairs in store around so he can make getting in and out of his “spot” easier (there’s a certain chair he HAS to sit in) and will get pissed off if you move them back, even though they’re not supposed to be be moved in the first place. He’ll go to the bathroom for like 15 minutes at a time and will run the hot water the whole time he’s in there. He’s also into schizoid alien conspiracies. One time I wore a blind skateboard shirt with the little grim reaper dude on the back, he saw it and said he looks like an alien and that aliens zapped his pre frontal cortex. Neat! He also saw me with a blink-182 shirt and claimed to know Tom Delonge. He’s been banned from the store before for screaming at my coworker about the chairs, but has been allowed back in.  When he’s at the register he’s extremely out of breath, the first time I rung him up I thought I had to call the ER lmao. Speaking of breath, his stinks. He also might live in his car. He can be a creep towards my female coworkers and female customers in the store, which unfortunately is an issue with older people here. :( I don’t think he has any friends or family, but I can’t say I feel bad.

Regular #2: Tweaker guy who can somehow afford several coffees a day. I think he lives with his brother and he gets welfare checks, but still. Anyways, he’s got a messed up eye and whenever you ring him up there’s a 75% chance he’ll throw a bible verse at you. Or at least I think it’s a bible verse, only words I can make out of his unintelligible mumbling are “god so love the world”. My coworker who’s in a cult enjoys his company. Sometimes he’ll go around the store preaching the word of God to the customers, and they get so clearly uncomfortable. One time a couple shooed him away and he went to a chair and cried for a bit. That was fun. He likes to ask my female coworkers out, so they just started telling him they’re married. But yeah whenever he’s in line he’s got this menacing glare that I think is really funny lol.

Regular #3: Usually she’ll ask a good amount of questions about the menu, which is nothing. But when you ring her up and she’ll claim some BS about her app not working, and when you try to help her with it she’ll try to get all these other discounts and will hold up the line for literally 10 minutes. It’s gotten to the point where the baristas had to make drinks for the people behind her before they even ordered. That may seem rude to her, but she does this literally everytime and she KNOWS what she’s doing. My manager and some coworkers will just comp her drinks, but I hate that because then she gets it for free and will just come back as entitled as before. But yeah, she’s not a tweaker or a crazy old dude, but I hate her nonetheless.

Regular #4: Insane homeless lady. Sometimes she wears a trash bag around her waste. We call her palpatine since she’s always wearing a hoodie lmao. Sometime she’ll get a coffee (when she pays she’ll either slam her change on the counter or give you the fakest 100$ bill you’ve ever seen) or just say the craziest shit to my coworkers and/or the customers. She’s been kicked out several times because of that. Why not ban her? She’s so messed up in the head she would probably forget and come back in. Sometimes she’ll walk by the store but won’t come in (thank god)

I had asked questions on this board before and the responses helped a lot. We loved PR and are already planning to return as soon as we can. 

We drove around the island on Hwy 2 from San Juan to Ponce and then cut back through the middle to return to San Juan. Some favorites: the entire northern and western coasts, especially Mar Chiquita and Rincon; Hacienda Encanta (coffee farm); El Yunque; Old San Juan. . . . The people were without exception super friendly and helpful. Most of course speak English but they seemed to appreciate our efforts to speak Spanish, too. 

We did have some difficulties with food. We didn't know what to order and got really good food probably only twice. We did not want to eat at chains--only ate once at McD's for breakfast and were quite horrified to get our ham/cheese/egg sandwich with pancakes instead of a biscuit! Mofongo is good for one meal now and then, not every day twice a day. We had excellent seafood in Rincon. 

Had some issues with AirBnB--the first one didn't have any hot water and the stove wasn't working. The owner got snotty and told us just to take a cold shower and then refused to take any further calls, even though those calls were regarding the lock box to leave the keys in, which we could not find. The one we stayed in in San Juan, an older condominium, was decent until my husband got stuck in the elevator. We had stopped taking it because it was so shaky and bumpy, but he was in a hurry and got stuck between floors for about 20 minutes. AirBnB was on the ball for both.

I’ll try not to dwell too much on the negatives, as I’ve already spent a lot of time grieving what happened. I’m 24F muslim who married 28M two years ago in an arranged marriage. Despite it being arranged, I fell in love with him the moment I saw him on our wedding day.

I moved to his country after our marriage and lived with his family, making a huge effort to adjust to a new culture, language, and environment. It was difficult, but I truly loved him and wanted to make it work. He used to be very sweet at the start of our marriage, but over time, things began to change. He became emotionally detached, and I could feel him pulling away from me. During that time, I was doing everything I could to fix the relationship, but it felt like I was the only one trying.

I thought we would be moving out this year, as I had expressed early on that I felt uncomfortable living with his family. His mother, despite my efforts to impress her, never seemed to like me. I was open about how difficult it was for me—being in a new country, adjusting to a new family, and dealing with depression. I told them repeatedly that it was my first year, and I just needed time to settle. I believed that once we moved out, I would feel better and we could finally start our lives together.

Living there was tough. I was often depressed and cried a lot, but I pushed through. While there, I completed my master’s degree, found a job, and worked hard. On weekends, I took on household responsibilities—cooking, cleaning, and fulfilling my in-law duties. It wasn’t easy, but I tried my best.

After a year, I discovered that he had been cheating on me. He had downloaded a dating app, met someone else, and complained to her about how I was “too emotional.” What made it even worse was that his affair partner knew he was married but still carried on. She portrays herself as a very Islamic person, which I find incredibly hypocritical.

When I found out, he tried to pressure me into deleting the evidence, but I went straight to his parents to show them before he could spin the story. To my shock, instead of holding him accountable, his parents blamed *me*. They said things like, “You don’t make coffee for my son, and that’s why he did this.” It was absurd.

Then, my husband and his mother came up with a laundry list of complaints about me. They called my parents to complain as well, accusing me of being lazy and hating his mom. A lot of their complaints were exaggerated or outright twisted. For example, I did vent about his mom to him privately, asking why she didn’t like me despite my efforts, but they painted it as if I was constantly hating on her. He also used me wanting to move out against me, making me out to be a bad person by mentioning that to his mom saying that I asked for this way too early in the relationship.

As for being lazy, yes, I got tired sometimes—it was overwhelming juggling work, studying, and living in a tense environment—but I still put in a lot of effort on weekends to avoid exactly this kind of blame. My parents were frustrated, asking why they hadn’t brought these issues up earlier instead of using them now to justify his cheating.

Now, I’m back with my parents, away from them all. My husband and his family have gone silent. I’ve chosen not to reach out because any conversation with him just ends in gaslighting, shaming, and projection. He accuses me of betraying his family by leaving, ignoring the fact that he betrayed *me*. I did not get a single apology. Instead he is repeatedly asking me what I can do to fix this relationship. I feel like flaws and all, I still did the best that I could given my circumstances so I'm just exhausted at this point. Reading his messages and constant blaming....it's funny to think about. I barely even scolded him considering he cheated on me with some girl for a month and going around with her. Meanwhile I'm being told I'm not a good wife constantly in messages.

I have my flaws. I'm not saying I don't. But I believe it's the type of flaws that should be discussed within the relationship. He said nothing about any of this, and he went and cheated on me with someone instead of working on things.

Things are in a standstill where none of us are really doing anything. It's gone to a pause.

I know I’ve vented a lot here, but I just needed to get it out. What really matters is that I want to focus on healing and becoming better for myself. Does anyone have any advice on how I can move forward?",2,1731948563.0,relationshipadvice,4,1.0,False

I know how this sounds. It’s probably the same thing I’d say if I were reading this from the outside. But it’s different when it’s you… when it’s *your* life peeling away one layer at a time, revealing something else underneath. Something that isn’t you.

It all started with a video. Just one click, one late night, one thread… That I should’ve ignored. I’d been on the internet long enough to know that certain parts of it… they’re like old, forgotten alleyways. Sure, you can go in, but you won’t always find your way out.

That night, I was browsing through a barely functional old forum. No moderators, no recent posts, just a digital graveyard of weird videos, conspiracy theories, and forgotten usernames. And then there it was—just a plain, nondescript post. The title read: “DO NOT WATCH ALONE.”

Somehow, that was enough to make me click.

The post was simple. Just a link and a warning: “Watch if you want, but don’t be alone when you do. It’ll know if you are.” I laughed a little at that. But in that dark, silent room, with just my screen lighting my face, I was all too aware that I *was* alone. Part of me felt a prick of apprehension, but curiosity always wins, doesn’t it?

I clicked. The screen went black for a moment, as if the video was loading, but then nothing happened. Just static… flickering pixels that barely formed a picture. I frowned, my eyes straining. There was a sound, a low hum that made my bones feel strange, almost like a tuning fork vibrating from inside me.

And then I saw them—two eyes, staring directly into the screen. It wasn’t a normal gaze; there was something about it, a kind of hunger or desperation. The eyes would blink, stare, blink again, then fade back into static, as if they were flickering between worlds.

Then came a sound. A whisper, faint, garbled… unintelligible. I leaned closer to the screen, trying to make it out, but the sound only became more chaotic, a mess of syllables that felt wrong, like they didn’t belong to any language.

Then, all at once, it stopped. My computer went dead—just a black screen, completely shut off. I felt my heart pounding, faster than it should have. My room was cold, my pulse quick. I tried telling myself it was just an old, corrupt file or a glitch, but something in my gut told me otherwise.

Shutting my laptop, I took a breath. I brushed it off. It was just a video, a joke, someone’s prank that went wrong. Still, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as I crawled into bed that night.

It wasn’t until the next morning that I remembered the video. At first, I wasn’t even sure it had happened—like the memory was something I’d dreamed. But when I opened my laptop, I saw the static-filled screen, frozen right where it had cut out.

I frowned, rebooting it. It powered up just fine, but something felt… off. You know that feeling you get when you’re in a room and feel like someone else has just been there, maybe only moments ago? A lingering sense of presence that you can’t shake? That’s what it felt like sitting there, alone in my apartment, staring at my own screen.

I scrolled through my history to find the post, but… it was gone. Not just the post, but the entire forum. I tried a few other searches, digging through cached pages, even going as far as to pull up some random discussion threads I remembered reading. Every link, every trace, was gone.

A chill crept up my spine. This wasn’t exactly normal, but things disappear online all the time, right? Forums shut down, people take content offline. I forced myself to brush it off.

The rest of the day was fine. I went through work, ran some errands, and by the time evening rolled around, I’d managed to laugh it off. It was just a creepy prank, I told myself. Maybe a hacker’s joke, something meant to mess with people like me who wander into strange corners of the internet.

But then, that night, things got weirder.

It was around 2 a.m. when I finally turned in. The room was dark, the soft hum of my old computer the only noise. I was drifting off when I heard it—a faint, rhythmic clicking.

I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my desk. My laptop. I stood, inching closer, and the sound got louder. A clicking, tapping sound, like fingers tapping on the keyboard. But no one was there. I could see the laptop’s screen in the dark, a faint, greenish glow illuminating the empty room.

I swallowed, flicked on the light, and the sound stopped immediately. I sat down and shook the mouse, waking up the screen.

There was a message on it. Just one line, typed out in a plain text document.

*You shouldn’t have watched.*

I stared at it, my pulse hammering in my ears. I hadn’t typed that, and there was no one else here. Trying to rationalize it, I told myself it had to be a leftover message from when the laptop glitched during the video. I was probably half-asleep, freaked out, jumping at shadows. I deleted the message, closed the laptop, and headed back to bed.

But as I lay there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was in the room with me. I kept my eyes on the ceiling, trying not to look toward the desk. It felt as if someone were watching me, studying me, but from where, I couldn’t tell.

Sleep was slow to come, and when it did, it was shallow, dreamless.

The next few days were more of the same, only worse. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find strange messages: *Are you alone?* … *Did you like the video?* … *Are you still watching?*

It didn’t matter where I was. Work, home, the coffee shop down the street—I’d open my laptop, and there it would be. The same plain-text documents, always a single line, always unsigned. I deleted them as quickly as they came, but each time, they sent a shock of cold through me, a kind of primal dread I couldn’t explain.

Then, one night, it happened again. I was getting ready for bed, brushing my teeth, when I noticed something unusual. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a faint flickering glow. I turned, staring down the hallway, and froze.

My laptop was on again. The screen was black, but the camera light—tiny and green—was blinking at me. Slowly, methodically, like an eye opening and closing, watching.

I stepped closer, feeling my throat go dry. No one had touched it; I was sure of that. But it was recording.

I slammed the laptop shut, trying to ignore the cold sweat creeping down my spine. I forced myself into bed, but I couldn’t sleep. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, feeling as if every shadow on the walls was leaning in, closing around me.

The next morning, I’d almost convinced myself that it was all a tech glitch, that maybe I was just imagining things. I decided I’d reinstall my operating system, maybe even replace the laptop altogether.

But when I turned it on, I found something that wiped away all my attempts at rationalization.

It was another message, but this time it was different. It was a photo, not text. And in that grainy, dim image, I could make out the familiar shapes of my own room—my bed, my desk, my chair. Only the angle was… off. It was as if the photo had been taken from outside, through the window.

I didn’t know what to do. My hands were shaking, and I felt a creeping panic settle over me. Someone was watching me. They’d been in my room, or close enough to see inside.

And then, at the bottom of the screen, one last message flashed:

*We’re just getting started.*

I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? I’d checked every lock on my windows, every inch of my apartment, but nothing seemed secure enough. I lay in bed, stiff and staring into the darkness, feeling as if a dozen invisible eyes were hovering just beyond my reach, waiting.

The next morning, everything felt wrong. My skin prickled with tension, and I jumped at the smallest sounds—a creak of the floorboards, the hum of the refrigerator, even the faint rustling of leaves outside my window. I tried to tell myself I was overreacting, but every attempt at rationalizing this only felt like a lie I was desperately trying to believe.

The day passed in a blur of half-formed thoughts and mindless tasks. I went to work, trying to focus, but I could feel the weight of a thousand unseen eyes pressing down on me. I avoided my laptop, avoided screens entirely. Something inside me was terrified that if I looked, I’d see another message… or worse, another photo.

When I finally returned home that night, I felt like a stranger in my own apartment. Every inch of it felt contaminated, tainted by whatever presence had wormed its way into my life. I dropped my things by the door and paced the length of my living room, wringing my hands, glancing around as if the walls themselves were watching.

That’s when I decided to tell someone.

I called my friend Max. We’d been close for years, and he was the kind of person who could make you feel grounded, no matter how far gone you were. I told him everything—well, almost everything. I didn’t mention the photos, or the feeling of being watched. Just the video, the strange messages, and how I thought someone might be messing with me.

He laughed, saying it sounded like one of those online horror stories that he liked reading late at night.

“You’re probably just stressed, man,” he said in that easygoing tone of his. “The internet’s full of weird stuff. Maybe you accidentally got on someone’s bot list. Happens all the time.”

But even as he talked, I could hear a slight hesitation in his voice, a pause that told me he was humoring me, that he didn’t really believe me. And I didn’t blame him. This entire thing sounded insane, even to me.

“Why don’t you come over?” he offered after a moment. “Clear your head, have a beer. Forget about this whole mess.”

It sounded like a good idea, but the thought of leaving my apartment made me feel vulnerable, exposed. If I left, I’d be abandoning the only place I knew, the only place I could attempt to control. I thanked him, told him I’d think about it, and hung up.

But the call didn’t help. If anything, it made things worse. Max’s reaction left me feeling more isolated, more alone. I couldn’t explain why, but I knew deep down that whatever was happening, it was beyond the realm of pranks or computer glitches. And if I couldn’t get Max to believe me, how could I expect anyone else to?

That night, the feeling of being watched was stronger than ever. I kept seeing shadows flicker out of the corner of my eye, only to find nothing there when I turned. The noises, too, seemed louder, creaks in the floorboards, the faint scrape of something against the walls, a constant, quiet reminder that I wasn’t alone.

I tried to distract myself by going online, scrolling mindlessly through social media, but the feeling didn’t go away. In fact, it seemed to amplify. Every time I glanced up from the screen, I felt as if the shadows were edging closer, almost anticipating that I’d look away.

At some point, I found myself staring into the camera on my laptop. The little green light was off, and the lens itself was black, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was staring back at me, watching. I grabbed a piece of tape and covered the camera, but the feeling persisted.

I checked the locks on my windows and doors again, and then—almost impulsively—I went to my desk, pulled out a pen and a notebook, and started writing everything down.

It was a strange, desperate act, but it felt necessary. Maybe if I documented everything, I could find some kind of logic in this nightmare, something I’d overlooked. I wrote down every detail—the video, the messages, the photos, the shadows. I wrote until my hand cramped, until my thoughts blurred, until I was just jotting down phrases without meaning. And finally, when I couldn’t write anymore, I closed the notebook and went to bed.

But as I lay there, in the cold, dark silence, I heard something.

A low, barely-there sound, like a voice murmuring from a great distance. I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my laptop. I could hear it through the tape over the microphone, a faint, disjointed whisper, growing louder with each passing second.

I moved toward the desk, one slow step at a time. The screen was black, but the sound continued, filling the room like a strange, distorted melody.

And then, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped. The silence that followed was deafening.

I reached for the laptop, peeling the tape off the microphone, my hand trembling. As soon as the tape came off, the screen flickered to life, illuminating the room with a sickly green glow.

A text document was open, and there, on the blank page, was a single word, typed out in large, bold letters:

*HELLO.*

I slammed the laptop shut, my heart racing. I felt trapped, suffocated by the walls around me. The shadows on the walls seemed to close in, as if they’d been waiting for this moment, watching my every move.

I stumbled to the window, threw it open, and took a deep breath of cold night air, hoping it would clear my head. But as I looked out into the darkness, I saw a faint reflection in the glass, hovering just over my shoulder.

A figure. Silent, unmoving, its face shrouded in shadow, standing right behind me.

I whipped around, but there was no one there. Just the empty room, bathed in the glow of my closed laptop.

I sank to the floor, trying to calm my breathing, telling myself it was just my imagination. But deep down, I knew the truth.

I wasn’t alone. I hadn’t been alone since I’d watched that video. And whatever this thing was, whatever had found me… it wasn’t going to stop.

Not until it had what it wanted.

I tried to convince myself it was all in my head. I didn’t sleep that night—or the next. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt that presence in the room with me, standing just out of sight, waiting. By the third day, exhaustion had worn me down, hollowed me out. My reflection in the bathroom mirror looked pale and unfamiliar, like a ghost of myself.

But it wasn’t just my reflection that looked different. It was everything around me. My apartment felt foreign, the walls seemed to stretch in strange ways, and sounds were amplified, warped, making the silence itself feel like it was hiding something.

The messages kept coming, too. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find another one, as if someone—something—was documenting every step I took, every thought I had. *Did you sleep last night?* … *Do you feel it watching?* … *You’re almost ready.*

Ready for what?

I tried ignoring it, tried distracting myself with work, with calls to friends. I wanted to tell Max everything, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. No one would. So I kept it all inside, letting the fear fester.

But then the memory gaps started. Little things at first—a few minutes here, a few there. I’d sit down to work on something, only to find an hour had passed without me realizing it. I’d look down at my hands, feeling numb, disconnected, like I was watching myself from a distance.

And then I’d find the messages, typed in plain text on my screen, messages I had no memory of writing. Sometimes they were nonsense, random phrases and half-formed words. But other times, they were… disturbing.

*We’re almost together now.*

*Soon.*

One night, I woke up to find myself standing in front of my laptop, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, as if I’d been typing something in my sleep. The screen was filled with text—pages and pages of words, repeating the same sentence over and over:

*I am not alone.*

I deleted it all in a panic, my fingers shaking. I had no memory of writing those words, no idea how long I’d been standing there. I’d barely slept, barely eaten. My mind was unraveling, piece by piece.

I needed to escape. I packed a bag, threw my laptop into it, and left my apartment in the dead of night. I didn’t know where I was going, only that I needed to get away from those walls, those shadows, that feeling of being trapped. I walked through the streets, keeping my head down, glancing over my shoulder every few steps. The world felt surreal, dreamlike, as if I’d somehow stepped out of reality and into some distorted version of it.

I found myself at an old motel on the edge of town. It was cheap, rundown, but it felt safe, at least for the moment. I checked in and locked the door behind me, barricading it with the dresser, then collapsed onto the bed, my mind spinning.

But the relief was short-lived. As I lay there, staring at the cracked ceiling, I felt that familiar, creeping sensation. That feeling of being watched.

My laptop. I knew I shouldn’t open it, knew that whatever was on it was somehow tied to all of this. But I couldn’t stop myself. My hands moved of their own accord, reaching into my bag, pulling it out, setting it on the bed in front of me.

When I opened it, the screen flickered to life immediately, as if it had been waiting for me. A message appeared, one line at a time, in slow, deliberate keystrokes:

*You can’t run.*

*We’re almost ready.*

*You and I will be together soon.*

I shut the laptop, breathing heavily, my mind racing. The motel room felt smaller, like the walls were closing in. The light flickered, casting strange shadows across the room. I closed my eyes, trying to calm myself, but the words kept repeating in my mind.

The next morning, I woke up on the floor. I didn’t remember getting out of bed, didn’t remember falling asleep. The laptop was open beside me, another document on the screen. I squinted at the words, trying to focus, but my head felt foggy, my thoughts slipping away like sand through my fingers.

*We’re so close now.*

The worst part? The words were in my handwriting.

I stumbled to my feet, feeling light-headed, disoriented. My own reflection in the motel room mirror looked back at me, but there was something wrong with it. My eyes looked distant, empty, almost… hollow. I reached out to touch the glass, but my reflection didn’t move. It just stared, unblinking, as if someone else was looking out from behind my eyes.

I backed away, my heart pounding. I needed help. I pulled out my phone and dialed Max’s number, praying he’d pick up. When he answered, his voice was groggy, annoyed—it was early, and I could tell he wasn’t in the mood for whatever I was about to say.

“Max, something’s wrong with me,” I whispered, glancing nervously around the room. “I… I don’t know what’s happening. I think… I think something’s trying to take over.”

There was a long pause. I could hear him breathing, but he didn’t say anything.

“Max?” I said, my voice trembling.

Another pause, and then, in a voice that didn’t sound like his own, he spoke.

*“You’re almost ready.”*

I dropped the phone, backing away from it as if it had burned me. The voice on the other end wasn’t Max’s. It was deeper, colder, laced with something dark and twisted. I felt like I was losing my mind, like reality itself was warping around me.

I stumbled back to the bed, clutching my head, trying to block out the voice, but it was everywhere, filling the room, whispering from the walls, echoing in my own mind. *We’re almost together now.* It repeated, over and over, drowning out my own thoughts, filling every corner of my mind.

I don’t know how long I lay there, caught in that nightmarish trance. Hours? Days? Time had lost all meaning. All I knew was that I was slipping away, piece by piece, my own thoughts and memories fading, being replaced by something else, something dark and ancient and hungry.

And then, finally, the voice spoke one last time, louder than ever, echoing in my mind like a bell tolling.

*“It’s time.”*

I don’t remember when I stopped feeling like myself. Days blurred into nights, thoughts that should’ve been mine became strangers in my own mind. I would stare into the mirror and barely recognize the face looking back—a face that seemed familiar, but with eyes that didn’t belong to me.

It was like I was watching from somewhere far away, like I’d become a passenger in my own body, trapped in the dark while something else took the reins.

The messages kept appearing. Every time I looked at my laptop, I’d find new notes, new words, new pieces of some grand design that I couldn’t understand. They told me I was almost ready, that soon I would become something more. That the waiting was over.

The thing I feared most, though, was the silence. When it came, I knew it was close. It was like holding my breath underwater, a suffocating, still quiet that pressed in on all sides, waiting for me to let go, to give in completely.

And then one night, it happened.

I was lying in bed, feeling that familiar prickling sensation on my skin, that suffocating closeness of someone—or something—watching. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last threads of myself, but I could feel it slipping, feel *me* slipping.

The silence grew louder, thicker, pressing down on me until I couldn’t breathe. I sat up, gasping, reaching for the light, but my body didn’t respond. My hands felt heavy, foreign, as if they belonged to someone else. I tried to scream, but no sound came out.

I stumbled to my laptop, pulled it open, my fingers moving of their own accord. The screen flickered to life, and I watched, helpless, as words began to appear, one line at a time, written by my own hand but not by my own mind.

*I’m ready.*

The words sank into me like a weight, pulling me down into the depths of my own mind. I could feel myself fading, feel the boundaries of my own consciousness blurring, dissolving, being replaced by something vast, something ancient, something *hungry.*

I fought against it, clawed at the edges of my mind, trying to hold on to the last pieces of myself. But it was like grasping at smoke. My thoughts scattered, fragments of memories drifting away, slipping through my fingers.

And then, finally, there was nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was still sitting at my desk, but something was… different. The world looked sharper, clearer, as if I was seeing it for the first time. I glanced down at my hands, feeling a strange, detached curiosity. They looked the same as they always had, but I knew, somehow, that they weren’t *mine.*

I stood up, testing the feel of the body, stretching, moving my fingers. It was all so familiar, yet so strange, as if I was wearing a suit that fit perfectly but wasn’t my own.

I walked to the mirror, studying the face reflected there. It was the same face I’d seen every day of my life, but there was something different in the eyes—something dark, something that looked back at me with a knowing, hungry smile.

The remnants of the person who had once been here were fading, slipping into the void where I had waited so patiently. I watched them go, watched the last traces of their memories dissolve, leaving me free to fill this body, to inhabit this mind.

I leaned closer to the mirror, watching myself, feeling the weight of the new, empty shell, I had taken. I reached up, touching my face, smiling at the way it moved under my hand.

And then, as if on cue, my laptop chimed.

I turned, feeling the pull, the irresistible call of the screen. The page was already open, a blank document waiting for me. I took my seat, hands hovering over the keyboard, savoring the anticipation, the thrill of what was to come.

And I began to type.

*Hello.*

I could imagine the readers on the other side, waiting for the story to unfold, waiting for the familiar thrill of fear to creep up their spine. I knew they’d feel it. I knew they’d wonder if it was real, if it could happen to them.

I could feel my own smile widen as I typed, my fingers moving with a practiced ease, telling the story of the one who had come before, the one who had fought so hard, resisted so stubbornly, but who had ultimately lost.

And as I finished the story, as I typed the last line, I could feel the presence within me settled, content, satisfied—for now.

*They never saw it coming.*

*But now, perhaps, they will.*

I closed the laptop, the silence settling over me like a comfortable cloak. I looked around at the room that was now mine, at the life that was now mine, and felt a surge of satisfaction, of ownership.

I was here, in the world, alive in a way I hadn’t been in eons. And all it had taken was a little curiosity, a single video, a lone soul who had wandered too far, strayed into the wrong corner of the internet.

And I knew that soon, it would happen again.

Because, after all, curiosity is a powerful thing. And there’s always someone out there, searching, looking for something they shouldn’t.

I know how this sounds. It’s probably the same thing I’d say if I were reading this from the outside. But it’s different when it’s you… when it’s *your* life peeling away one layer at a time, revealing something else underneath. Something that isn’t you.

It all started with a video. Just one click, one late night, one thread… That I should’ve ignored. I’d been on the internet long enough to know that certain parts of it… they’re like old, forgotten alleyways. Sure, you can go in, but you won’t always find your way out.

That night, I was browsing through a barely functional old forum. No moderators, no recent posts, just a digital graveyard of weird videos, conspiracy theories, and forgotten usernames. And then there it was—just a plain, nondescript post. The title read: “DO NOT WATCH ALONE.”

Somehow, that was enough to make me click.

The post was simple. Just a link and a warning: “Watch if you want, but don’t be alone when you do. It’ll know if you are.” I laughed a little at that. But in that dark, silent room, with just my screen lighting my face, I was all too aware that I *was* alone. Part of me felt a prick of apprehension, but curiosity always wins, doesn’t it?

I clicked. The screen went black for a moment, as if the video was loading, but then nothing happened. Just static… flickering pixels that barely formed a picture. I frowned, my eyes straining. There was a sound, a low hum that made my bones feel strange, almost like a tuning fork vibrating from inside me.

And then I saw them—two eyes, staring directly into the screen. It wasn’t a normal gaze; there was something about it, a kind of hunger or desperation. The eyes would blink, stare, blink again, then fade back into static, as if they were flickering between worlds.

Then came a sound. A whisper, faint, garbled… unintelligible. I leaned closer to the screen, trying to make it out, but the sound only became more chaotic, a mess of syllables that felt wrong, like they didn’t belong to any language.

Then, all at once, it stopped. My computer went dead—just a black screen, completely shut off. I felt my heart pounding, faster than it should have. My room was cold, my pulse quick. I tried telling myself it was just an old, corrupt file or a glitch, but something in my gut told me otherwise.

Shutting my laptop, I took a breath. I brushed it off. It was just a video, a joke, someone’s prank that went wrong. Still, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as I crawled into bed that night.

It wasn’t until the next morning that I remembered the video. At first, I wasn’t even sure it had happened—like the memory was something I’d dreamed. But when I opened my laptop, I saw the static-filled screen, frozen right where it had cut out.

I frowned, rebooting it. It powered up just fine, but something felt… off. You know that feeling you get when you’re in a room and feel like someone else has just been there, maybe only moments ago? A lingering sense of presence that you can’t shake? That’s what it felt like sitting there, alone in my apartment, staring at my own screen.

I scrolled through my history to find the post, but… it was gone. Not just the post, but the entire forum. I tried a few other searches, digging through cached pages, even going as far as to pull up some random discussion threads I remembered reading. Every link, every trace, was gone.

A chill crept up my spine. This wasn’t exactly normal, but things disappear online all the time, right? Forums shut down, people take content offline. I forced myself to brush it off.

The rest of the day was fine. I went through work, ran some errands, and by the time evening rolled around, I’d managed to laugh it off. It was just a creepy prank, I told myself. Maybe a hacker’s joke, something meant to mess with people like me who wander into strange corners of the internet.

But then, that night, things got weirder.

It was around 2 a.m. when I finally turned in. The room was dark, the soft hum of my old computer the only noise. I was drifting off when I heard it—a faint, rhythmic clicking.

I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my desk. My laptop. I stood, inching closer, and the sound got louder. A clicking, tapping sound, like fingers tapping on the keyboard. But no one was there. I could see the laptop’s screen in the dark, a faint, greenish glow illuminating the empty room.

I swallowed, flicked on the light, and the sound stopped immediately. I sat down and shook the mouse, waking up the screen.

There was a message on it. Just one line, typed out in a plain text document.

*You shouldn’t have watched.*

I stared at it, my pulse hammering in my ears. I hadn’t typed that, and there was no one else here. Trying to rationalize it, I told myself it had to be a leftover message from when the laptop glitched during the video. I was probably half-asleep, freaked out, jumping at shadows. I deleted the message, closed the laptop, and headed back to bed.

But as I lay there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was in the room with me. I kept my eyes on the ceiling, trying not to look toward the desk. It felt as if someone were watching me, studying me, but from where, I couldn’t tell.

Sleep was slow to come, and when it did, it was shallow, dreamless.

The next few days were more of the same, only worse. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find strange messages: *Are you alone?* … *Did you like the video?* … *Are you still watching?*

It didn’t matter where I was. Work, home, the coffee shop down the street—I’d open my laptop, and there it would be. The same plain-text documents, always a single line, always unsigned. I deleted them as quickly as they came, but each time, they sent a shock of cold through me, a kind of primal dread I couldn’t explain.

Then, one night, it happened again. I was getting ready for bed, brushing my teeth, when I noticed something unusual. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a faint flickering glow. I turned, staring down the hallway, and froze.

My laptop was on again. The screen was black, but the camera light—tiny and green—was blinking at me. Slowly, methodically, like an eye opening and closing, watching.

I stepped closer, feeling my throat go dry. No one had touched it; I was sure of that. But it was recording.

I slammed the laptop shut, trying to ignore the cold sweat creeping down my spine. I forced myself into bed, but I couldn’t sleep. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, feeling as if every shadow on the walls was leaning in, closing around me.

The next morning, I’d almost convinced myself that it was all a tech glitch, that maybe I was just imagining things. I decided I’d reinstall my operating system, maybe even replace the laptop altogether.

But when I turned it on, I found something that wiped away all my attempts at rationalization.

It was another message, but this time it was different. It was a photo, not text. And in that grainy, dim image, I could make out the familiar shapes of my own room—my bed, my desk, my chair. Only the angle was… off. It was as if the photo had been taken from outside, through the window.

I didn’t know what to do. My hands were shaking, and I felt a creeping panic settle over me. Someone was watching me. They’d been in my room, or close enough to see inside.

And then, at the bottom of the screen, one last message flashed:

*We’re just getting started.*

I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? I’d checked every lock on my windows, every inch of my apartment, but nothing seemed secure enough. I lay in bed, stiff and staring into the darkness, feeling as if a dozen invisible eyes were hovering just beyond my reach, waiting.

The next morning, everything felt wrong. My skin prickled with tension, and I jumped at the smallest sounds—a creak of the floorboards, the hum of the refrigerator, even the faint rustling of leaves outside my window. I tried to tell myself I was overreacting, but every attempt at rationalizing this only felt like a lie I was desperately trying to believe.

The day passed in a blur of half-formed thoughts and mindless tasks. I went to work, trying to focus, but I could feel the weight of a thousand unseen eyes pressing down on me. I avoided my laptop, avoided screens entirely. Something inside me was terrified that if I looked, I’d see another message… or worse, another photo.

When I finally returned home that night, I felt like a stranger in my own apartment. Every inch of it felt contaminated, tainted by whatever presence had wormed its way into my life. I dropped my things by the door and paced the length of my living room, wringing my hands, glancing around as if the walls themselves were watching.

That’s when I decided to tell someone.

I called my friend Max. We’d been close for years, and he was the kind of person who could make you feel grounded, no matter how far gone you were. I told him everything—well, almost everything. I didn’t mention the photos, or the feeling of being watched. Just the video, the strange messages, and how I thought someone might be messing with me.

He laughed, saying it sounded like one of those online horror stories that he liked reading late at night.

“You’re probably just stressed, man,” he said in that easygoing tone of his. “The internet’s full of weird stuff. Maybe you accidentally got on someone’s bot list. Happens all the time.”

But even as he talked, I could hear a slight hesitation in his voice, a pause that told me he was humoring me, that he didn’t really believe me. And I didn’t blame him. This entire thing sounded insane, even to me.

“Why don’t you come over?” he offered after a moment. “Clear your head, have a beer. Forget about this whole mess.”

It sounded like a good idea, but the thought of leaving my apartment made me feel vulnerable, exposed. If I left, I’d be abandoning the only place I knew, the only place I could attempt to control. I thanked him, told him I’d think about it, and hung up.

But the call didn’t help. If anything, it made things worse. Max’s reaction left me feeling more isolated, more alone. I couldn’t explain why, but I knew deep down that whatever was happening, it was beyond the realm of pranks or computer glitches. And if I couldn’t get Max to believe me, how could I expect anyone else to?

That night, the feeling of being watched was stronger than ever. I kept seeing shadows flicker out of the corner of my eye, only to find nothing there when I turned. The noises, too, seemed louder, creaks in the floorboards, the faint scrape of something against the walls, a constant, quiet reminder that I wasn’t alone.

I tried to distract myself by going online, scrolling mindlessly through social media, but the feeling didn’t go away. In fact, it seemed to amplify. Every time I glanced up from the screen, I felt as if the shadows were edging closer, almost anticipating that I’d look away.

At some point, I found myself staring into the camera on my laptop. The little green light was off, and the lens itself was black, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was staring back at me, watching. I grabbed a piece of tape and covered the camera, but the feeling persisted.

I checked the locks on my windows and doors again, and then—almost impulsively—I went to my desk, pulled out a pen and a notebook, and started writing everything down.

It was a strange, desperate act, but it felt necessary. Maybe if I documented everything, I could find some kind of logic in this nightmare, something I’d overlooked. I wrote down every detail—the video, the messages, the photos, the shadows. I wrote until my hand cramped, until my thoughts blurred, until I was just jotting down phrases without meaning. And finally, when I couldn’t write anymore, I closed the notebook and went to bed.

But as I lay there, in the cold, dark silence, I heard something.

A low, barely-there sound, like a voice murmuring from a great distance. I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my laptop. I could hear it through the tape over the microphone, a faint, disjointed whisper, growing louder with each passing second.

I moved toward the desk, one slow step at a time. The screen was black, but the sound continued, filling the room like a strange, distorted melody.

And then, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped. The silence that followed was deafening.

I reached for the laptop, peeling the tape off the microphone, my hand trembling. As soon as the tape came off, the screen flickered to life, illuminating the room with a sickly green glow.

A text document was open, and there, on the blank page, was a single word, typed out in large, bold letters:

*HELLO.*

I slammed the laptop shut, my heart racing. I felt trapped, suffocated by the walls around me. The shadows on the walls seemed to close in, as if they’d been waiting for this moment, watching my every move.

I stumbled to the window, threw it open, and took a deep breath of cold night air, hoping it would clear my head. But as I looked out into the darkness, I saw a faint reflection in the glass, hovering just over my shoulder.

A figure. Silent, unmoving, its face shrouded in shadow, standing right behind me.

I whipped around, but there was no one there. Just the empty room, bathed in the glow of my closed laptop.

I sank to the floor, trying to calm my breathing, telling myself it was just my imagination. But deep down, I knew the truth.

I wasn’t alone. I hadn’t been alone since I’d watched that video. And whatever this thing was, whatever had found me… it wasn’t going to stop.

Not until it had what it wanted.

I tried to convince myself it was all in my head. I didn’t sleep that night—or the next. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt that presence in the room with me, standing just out of sight, waiting. By the third day, exhaustion had worn me down, hollowed me out. My reflection in the bathroom mirror looked pale and unfamiliar, like a ghost of myself.

But it wasn’t just my reflection that looked different. It was everything around me. My apartment felt foreign, the walls seemed to stretch in strange ways, and sounds were amplified, warped, making the silence itself feel like it was hiding something.

The messages kept coming, too. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find another one, as if someone—something—was documenting every step I took, every thought I had. *Did you sleep last night?* … *Do you feel it watching?* … *You’re almost ready.*

Ready for what?

I tried ignoring it, tried distracting myself with work, with calls to friends. I wanted to tell Max everything, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. No one would. So I kept it all inside, letting the fear fester.

But then the memory gaps started. Little things at first—a few minutes here, a few there. I’d sit down to work on something, only to find an hour had passed without me realizing it. I’d look down at my hands, feeling numb, disconnected, like I was watching myself from a distance.

And then I’d find the messages, typed in plain text on my screen, messages I had no memory of writing. Sometimes they were nonsense, random phrases and half-formed words. But other times, they were… disturbing.

*We’re almost together now.*

*Soon.*

One night, I woke up to find myself standing in front of my laptop, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, as if I’d been typing something in my sleep. The screen was filled with text—pages and pages of words, repeating the same sentence over and over:

*I am not alone.*

I deleted it all in a panic, my fingers shaking. I had no memory of writing those words, no idea how long I’d been standing there. I’d barely slept, barely eaten. My mind was unraveling, piece by piece.

I needed to escape. I packed a bag, threw my laptop into it, and left my apartment in the dead of night. I didn’t know where I was going, only that I needed to get away from those walls, those shadows, that feeling of being trapped. I walked through the streets, keeping my head down, glancing over my shoulder every few steps. The world felt surreal, dreamlike, as if I’d somehow stepped out of reality and into some distorted version of it.

I found myself at an old motel on the edge of town. It was cheap, rundown, but it felt safe, at least for the moment. I checked in and locked the door behind me, barricading it with the dresser, then collapsed onto the bed, my mind spinning.

But the relief was short-lived. As I lay there, staring at the cracked ceiling, I felt that familiar, creeping sensation. That feeling of being watched.

My laptop. I knew I shouldn’t open it, knew that whatever was on it was somehow tied to all of this. But I couldn’t stop myself. My hands moved of their own accord, reaching into my bag, pulling it out, setting it on the bed in front of me.

When I opened it, the screen flickered to life immediately, as if it had been waiting for me. A message appeared, one line at a time, in slow, deliberate keystrokes:

*You can’t run.*

*We’re almost ready.*

*You and I will be together soon.*

I shut the laptop, breathing heavily, my mind racing. The motel room felt smaller, like the walls were closing in. The light flickered, casting strange shadows across the room. I closed my eyes, trying to calm myself, but the words kept repeating in my mind.

The next morning, I woke up on the floor. I didn’t remember getting out of bed, didn’t remember falling asleep. The laptop was open beside me, another document on the screen. I squinted at the words, trying to focus, but my head felt foggy, my thoughts slipping away like sand through my fingers.

*We’re so close now.*

The worst part? The words were in my handwriting.

I stumbled to my feet, feeling light-headed, disoriented. My own reflection in the motel room mirror looked back at me, but there was something wrong with it. My eyes looked distant, empty, almost… hollow. I reached out to touch the glass, but my reflection didn’t move. It just stared, unblinking, as if someone else was looking out from behind my eyes.

I backed away, my heart pounding. I needed help. I pulled out my phone and dialed Max’s number, praying he’d pick up. When he answered, his voice was groggy, annoyed—it was early, and I could tell he wasn’t in the mood for whatever I was about to say.

“Max, something’s wrong with me,” I whispered, glancing nervously around the room. “I… I don’t know what’s happening. I think… I think something’s trying to take over.”

There was a long pause. I could hear him breathing, but he didn’t say anything.

“Max?” I said, my voice trembling.

Another pause, and then, in a voice that didn’t sound like his own, he spoke.

*“You’re almost ready.”*

I dropped the phone, backing away from it as if it had burned me. The voice on the other end wasn’t Max’s. It was deeper, colder, laced with something dark and twisted. I felt like I was losing my mind, like reality itself was warping around me.

I stumbled back to the bed, clutching my head, trying to block out the voice, but it was everywhere, filling the room, whispering from the walls, echoing in my own mind. *We’re almost together now.* It repeated, over and over, drowning out my own thoughts, filling every corner of my mind.

And then, finally, the voice spoke one last time, louder than ever, echoing in my mind like a bell tolling.

*“It’s time.”*

I don’t remember when I stopped feeling like myself. Days blurred into nights, thoughts that should’ve been mine became strangers in my own mind. I would stare into the mirror and barely recognize the face looking back—a face that seemed familiar, but with eyes that didn’t belong to me.

It was like I was watching from somewhere far away, like I’d become a passenger in my own body, trapped in the dark while something else took the reins.

The messages kept appearing. Every time I looked at my laptop, I’d find new notes, new words, new pieces of some grand design that I couldn’t understand. They told me I was almost ready, that soon I would become something more. That the waiting was over.

The thing I feared most, though, was the silence. When it came, I knew it was close. It was like holding my breath underwater, a suffocating, still quiet that pressed in on all sides, waiting for me to let go, to give in completely.

And then one night, it happened.

I was lying in bed, feeling that familiar prickling sensation on my skin, that suffocating closeness of someone—or something—watching. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last threads of myself, but I could feel it slipping, feel *me* slipping.

The silence grew louder, thicker, pressing down on me until I couldn’t breathe. I sat up, gasping, reaching for the light, but my body didn’t respond. My hands felt heavy, foreign, as if they belonged to someone else. I tried to scream, but no sound came out.

I stumbled to my laptop, pulled it open, my fingers moving of their own accord. The screen flickered to life, and I watched, helpless, as words began to appear, one line at a time, written by my own hand but not by my own mind.

*I’m ready.*

The words sank into me like a weight, pulling me down into the depths of my own mind. I could feel myself fading, feel the boundaries of my own consciousness blurring, dissolving, being replaced by something vast, something ancient, something *hungry.*

I fought against it, clawed at the edges of my mind, trying to hold on to the last pieces of myself. But it was like grasping at smoke. My thoughts scattered, fragments of memories drifting away, slipping through my fingers.

And then, finally, there was nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was still sitting at my desk, but something was… different. The world looked sharper, clearer, as if I was seeing it for the first time. I glanced down at my hands, feeling a strange, detached curiosity. They looked the same as they always had, but I knew, somehow, that they weren’t *mine.*

I stood up, testing the feel of the body, stretching, moving my fingers. It was all so familiar, yet so strange, as if I was wearing a suit that fit perfectly but wasn’t my own.

I walked to the mirror, studying the face reflected there. It was the same face I’d seen every day of my life, but there was something different in the eyes—something dark, something that looked back at me with a knowing, hungry smile.

The remnants of the person who had once been here were fading, slipping into the void where I had waited so patiently. I watched them go, watched the last traces of their memories dissolve, leaving me free to fill this body, to inhabit this mind.

I leaned closer to the mirror, watching myself, feeling the weight of the new, empty shell, I had taken. I reached up, touching my face, smiling at the way it moved under my hand.

And then, as if on cue, my laptop chimed.

I turned, feeling the pull, the irresistible call of the screen. The page was already open, a blank document waiting for me. I took my seat, hands hovering over the keyboard, savoring the anticipation, the thrill of what was to come.

And I began to type.

*Hello.*

I could imagine the readers on the other side, waiting for the story to unfold, waiting for the familiar thrill of fear to creep up their spine. I knew they’d feel it. I knew they’d wonder if it was real, if it could happen to them.

I could feel my own smile widen as I typed, my fingers moving with a practiced ease, telling the story of the one who had come before, the one who had fought so hard, resisted so stubbornly, but who had ultimately lost.

And as I finished the story, as I typed the last line, I could feel the presence within me settled, content, satisfied—for now.

*They never saw it coming.*

*But now, perhaps, they will.*

I closed the laptop, the silence settling over me like a comfortable cloak. I looked around at the room that was now mine, at the life that was now mine, and felt a surge of satisfaction, of ownership.

I was here, in the world, alive in a way I hadn’t been in eons. And all it had taken was a little curiosity, a single video, a lone soul who had wandered too far, strayed into the wrong corner of the internet.

And I knew that soon, it would happen again.

Because, after all, curiosity is a powerful thing. And there’s always someone out there, searching, looking for something they shouldn’t.

I know how this sounds. It’s probably the same thing I’d say if I were reading this from the outside. But it’s different when it’s you… when it’s *your* life peeling away one layer at a time, revealing something else underneath. Something that isn’t you.

It all started with a video. Just one click, one late night, one thread… That I should’ve ignored. I’d been on the internet long enough to know that certain parts of it… they’re like old, forgotten alleyways. Sure, you can go in, but you won’t always find your way out.

That night, I was browsing through a barely functional old forum. No moderators, no recent posts, just a digital graveyard of weird videos, conspiracy theories, and forgotten usernames. And then there it was—just a plain, nondescript post. The title read: “DO NOT WATCH ALONE.”

Somehow, that was enough to make me click.

The post was simple. Just a link and a warning: “Watch if you want, but don’t be alone when you do. It’ll know if you are.” I laughed a little at that. But in that dark, silent room, with just my screen lighting my face, I was all too aware that I *was* alone. Part of me felt a prick of apprehension, but curiosity always wins, doesn’t it?

I clicked. The screen went black for a moment, as if the video was loading, but then nothing happened. Just static… flickering pixels that barely formed a picture. I frowned, my eyes straining. There was a sound, a low hum that made my bones feel strange, almost like a tuning fork vibrating from inside me.

And then I saw them—two eyes, staring directly into the screen. It wasn’t a normal gaze; there was something about it, a kind of hunger or desperation. The eyes would blink, stare, blink again, then fade back into static, as if they were flickering between worlds.

Then came a sound. A whisper, faint, garbled… unintelligible. I leaned closer to the screen, trying to make it out, but the sound only became more chaotic, a mess of syllables that felt wrong, like they didn’t belong to any language.

Then, all at once, it stopped. My computer went dead—just a black screen, completely shut off. I felt my heart pounding, faster than it should have. My room was cold, my pulse quick. I tried telling myself it was just an old, corrupt file or a glitch, but something in my gut told me otherwise.

Shutting my laptop, I took a breath. I brushed it off. It was just a video, a joke, someone’s prank that went wrong. Still, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as I crawled into bed that night.

It wasn’t until the next morning that I remembered the video. At first, I wasn’t even sure it had happened—like the memory was something I’d dreamed. But when I opened my laptop, I saw the static-filled screen, frozen right where it had cut out.

I frowned, rebooting it. It powered up just fine, but something felt… off. You know that feeling you get when you’re in a room and feel like someone else has just been there, maybe only moments ago? A lingering sense of presence that you can’t shake? That’s what it felt like sitting there, alone in my apartment, staring at my own screen.

I scrolled through my history to find the post, but… it was gone. Not just the post, but the entire forum. I tried a few other searches, digging through cached pages, even going as far as to pull up some random discussion threads I remembered reading. Every link, every trace, was gone.

A chill crept up my spine. This wasn’t exactly normal, but things disappear online all the time, right? Forums shut down, people take content offline. I forced myself to brush it off.

The rest of the day was fine. I went through work, ran some errands, and by the time evening rolled around, I’d managed to laugh it off. It was just a creepy prank, I told myself. Maybe a hacker’s joke, something meant to mess with people like me who wander into strange corners of the internet.

But then, that night, things got weirder.

It was around 2 a.m. when I finally turned in. The room was dark, the soft hum of my old computer the only noise. I was drifting off when I heard it—a faint, rhythmic clicking.

I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my desk. My laptop. I stood, inching closer, and the sound got louder. A clicking, tapping sound, like fingers tapping on the keyboard. But no one was there. I could see the laptop’s screen in the dark, a faint, greenish glow illuminating the empty room.

I swallowed, flicked on the light, and the sound stopped immediately. I sat down and shook the mouse, waking up the screen.

There was a message on it. Just one line, typed out in a plain text document.

*You shouldn’t have watched.*

I stared at it, my pulse hammering in my ears. I hadn’t typed that, and there was no one else here. Trying to rationalize it, I told myself it had to be a leftover message from when the laptop glitched during the video. I was probably half-asleep, freaked out, jumping at shadows. I deleted the message, closed the laptop, and headed back to bed.

But as I lay there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was in the room with me. I kept my eyes on the ceiling, trying not to look toward the desk. It felt as if someone were watching me, studying me, but from where, I couldn’t tell.

Sleep was slow to come, and when it did, it was shallow, dreamless.

The next few days were more of the same, only worse. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find strange messages: *Are you alone?* … *Did you like the video?* … *Are you still watching?*

It didn’t matter where I was. Work, home, the coffee shop down the street—I’d open my laptop, and there it would be. The same plain-text documents, always a single line, always unsigned. I deleted them as quickly as they came, but each time, they sent a shock of cold through me, a kind of primal dread I couldn’t explain.

Then, one night, it happened again. I was getting ready for bed, brushing my teeth, when I noticed something unusual. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a faint flickering glow. I turned, staring down the hallway, and froze.

My laptop was on again. The screen was black, but the camera light—tiny and green—was blinking at me. Slowly, methodically, like an eye opening and closing, watching.

I stepped closer, feeling my throat go dry. No one had touched it; I was sure of that. But it was recording.

I slammed the laptop shut, trying to ignore the cold sweat creeping down my spine. I forced myself into bed, but I couldn’t sleep. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, feeling as if every shadow on the walls was leaning in, closing around me.

The next morning, I’d almost convinced myself that it was all a tech glitch, that maybe I was just imagining things. I decided I’d reinstall my operating system, maybe even replace the laptop altogether.

But when I turned it on, I found something that wiped away all my attempts at rationalization.

It was another message, but this time it was different. It was a photo, not text. And in that grainy, dim image, I could make out the familiar shapes of my own room—my bed, my desk, my chair. Only the angle was… off. It was as if the photo had been taken from outside, through the window.

I didn’t know what to do. My hands were shaking, and I felt a creeping panic settle over me. Someone was watching me. They’d been in my room, or close enough to see inside.

And then, at the bottom of the screen, one last message flashed:

*We’re just getting started.*

I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? I’d checked every lock on my windows, every inch of my apartment, but nothing seemed secure enough. I lay in bed, stiff and staring into the darkness, feeling as if a dozen invisible eyes were hovering just beyond my reach, waiting.

The next morning, everything felt wrong. My skin prickled with tension, and I jumped at the smallest sounds—a creak of the floorboards, the hum of the refrigerator, even the faint rustling of leaves outside my window. I tried to tell myself I was overreacting, but every attempt at rationalizing this only felt like a lie I was desperately trying to believe.

The day passed in a blur of half-formed thoughts and mindless tasks. I went to work, trying to focus, but I could feel the weight of a thousand unseen eyes pressing down on me. I avoided my laptop, avoided screens entirely. Something inside me was terrified that if I looked, I’d see another message… or worse, another photo.

When I finally returned home that night, I felt like a stranger in my own apartment. Every inch of it felt contaminated, tainted by whatever presence had wormed its way into my life. I dropped my things by the door and paced the length of my living room, wringing my hands, glancing around as if the walls themselves were watching.

That’s when I decided to tell someone.

I called my friend Max. We’d been close for years, and he was the kind of person who could make you feel grounded, no matter how far gone you were. I told him everything—well, almost everything. I didn’t mention the photos, or the feeling of being watched. Just the video, the strange messages, and how I thought someone might be messing with me.

He laughed, saying it sounded like one of those online horror stories that he liked reading late at night.

“You’re probably just stressed, man,” he said in that easygoing tone of his. “The internet’s full of weird stuff. Maybe you accidentally got on someone’s bot list. Happens all the time.”

But even as he talked, I could hear a slight hesitation in his voice, a pause that told me he was humoring me, that he didn’t really believe me. And I didn’t blame him. This entire thing sounded insane, even to me.

“Why don’t you come over?” he offered after a moment. “Clear your head, have a beer. Forget about this whole mess.”

It sounded like a good idea, but the thought of leaving my apartment made me feel vulnerable, exposed. If I left, I’d be abandoning the only place I knew, the only place I could attempt to control. I thanked him, told him I’d think about it, and hung up.

But the call didn’t help. If anything, it made things worse. Max’s reaction left me feeling more isolated, more alone. I couldn’t explain why, but I knew deep down that whatever was happening, it was beyond the realm of pranks or computer glitches. And if I couldn’t get Max to believe me, how could I expect anyone else to?

That night, the feeling of being watched was stronger than ever. I kept seeing shadows flicker out of the corner of my eye, only to find nothing there when I turned. The noises, too, seemed louder, creaks in the floorboards, the faint scrape of something against the walls, a constant, quiet reminder that I wasn’t alone.

I tried to distract myself by going online, scrolling mindlessly through social media, but the feeling didn’t go away. In fact, it seemed to amplify. Every time I glanced up from the screen, I felt as if the shadows were edging closer, almost anticipating that I’d look away.

At some point, I found myself staring into the camera on my laptop. The little green light was off, and the lens itself was black, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was staring back at me, watching. I grabbed a piece of tape and covered the camera, but the feeling persisted.

I checked the locks on my windows and doors again, and then—almost impulsively—I went to my desk, pulled out a pen and a notebook, and started writing everything down.

It was a strange, desperate act, but it felt necessary. Maybe if I documented everything, I could find some kind of logic in this nightmare, something I’d overlooked. I wrote down every detail—the video, the messages, the photos, the shadows. I wrote until my hand cramped, until my thoughts blurred, until I was just jotting down phrases without meaning. And finally, when I couldn’t write anymore, I closed the notebook and went to bed.

But as I lay there, in the cold, dark silence, I heard something.

A low, barely-there sound, like a voice murmuring from a great distance. I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my laptop. I could hear it through the tape over the microphone, a faint, disjointed whisper, growing louder with each passing second.

I moved toward the desk, one slow step at a time. The screen was black, but the sound continued, filling the room like a strange, distorted melody.

And then, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped. The silence that followed was deafening.

I reached for the laptop, peeling the tape off the microphone, my hand trembling. As soon as the tape came off, the screen flickered to life, illuminating the room with a sickly green glow.

A text document was open, and there, on the blank page, was a single word, typed out in large, bold letters:

*HELLO.*

I slammed the laptop shut, my heart racing. I felt trapped, suffocated by the walls around me. The shadows on the walls seemed to close in, as if they’d been waiting for this moment, watching my every move.

I stumbled to the window, threw it open, and took a deep breath of cold night air, hoping it would clear my head. But as I looked out into the darkness, I saw a faint reflection in the glass, hovering just over my shoulder.

A figure. Silent, unmoving, its face shrouded in shadow, standing right behind me.

I whipped around, but there was no one there. Just the empty room, bathed in the glow of my closed laptop.

I sank to the floor, trying to calm my breathing, telling myself it was just my imagination. But deep down, I knew the truth.

I wasn’t alone. I hadn’t been alone since I’d watched that video. And whatever this thing was, whatever had found me… it wasn’t going to stop.

Not until it had what it wanted.

I tried to convince myself it was all in my head. I didn’t sleep that night—or the next. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt that presence in the room with me, standing just out of sight, waiting. By the third day, exhaustion had worn me down, hollowed me out. My reflection in the bathroom mirror looked pale and unfamiliar, like a ghost of myself.

But it wasn’t just my reflection that looked different. It was everything around me. My apartment felt foreign, the walls seemed to stretch in strange ways, and sounds were amplified, warped, making the silence itself feel like it was hiding something.

The messages kept coming, too. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find another one, as if someone—something—was documenting every step I took, every thought I had. *Did you sleep last night?* … *Do you feel it watching?* … *You’re almost ready.*

Ready for what?

I tried ignoring it, tried distracting myself with work, with calls to friends. I wanted to tell Max everything, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. No one would. So I kept it all inside, letting the fear fester.

But then the memory gaps started. Little things at first—a few minutes here, a few there. I’d sit down to work on something, only to find an hour had passed without me realizing it. I’d look down at my hands, feeling numb, disconnected, like I was watching myself from a distance.

And then I’d find the messages, typed in plain text on my screen, messages I had no memory of writing. Sometimes they were nonsense, random phrases and half-formed words. But other times, they were… disturbing.

*We’re almost together now.*

*Soon.*

One night, I woke up to find myself standing in front of my laptop, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, as if I’d been typing something in my sleep. The screen was filled with text—pages and pages of words, repeating the same sentence over and over:

*I am not alone.*

I deleted it all in a panic, my fingers shaking. I had no memory of writing those words, no idea how long I’d been standing there. I’d barely slept, barely eaten. My mind was unraveling, piece by piece.

I needed to escape. I packed a bag, threw my laptop into it, and left my apartment in the dead of night. I didn’t know where I was going, only that I needed to get away from those walls, those shadows, that feeling of being trapped. I walked through the streets, keeping my head down, glancing over my shoulder every few steps. The world felt surreal, dreamlike, as if I’d somehow stepped out of reality and into some distorted version of it.

I found myself at an old motel on the edge of town. It was cheap, rundown, but it felt safe, at least for the moment. I checked in and locked the door behind me, barricading it with the dresser, then collapsed onto the bed, my mind spinning.

But the relief was short-lived. As I lay there, staring at the cracked ceiling, I felt that familiar, creeping sensation. That feeling of being watched.

My laptop. I knew I shouldn’t open it, knew that whatever was on it was somehow tied to all of this. But I couldn’t stop myself. My hands moved of their own accord, reaching into my bag, pulling it out, setting it on the bed in front of me.

When I opened it, the screen flickered to life immediately, as if it had been waiting for me. A message appeared, one line at a time, in slow, deliberate keystrokes:

*You can’t run.*

*We’re almost ready.*

*You and I will be together soon.*

I shut the laptop, breathing heavily, my mind racing. The motel room felt smaller, like the walls were closing in. The light flickered, casting strange shadows across the room. I closed my eyes, trying to calm myself, but the words kept repeating in my mind.

The next morning, I woke up on the floor. I didn’t remember getting out of bed, didn’t remember falling asleep. The laptop was open beside me, another document on the screen. I squinted at the words, trying to focus, but my head felt foggy, my thoughts slipping away like sand through my fingers.

*We’re so close now.*

The worst part? The words were in my handwriting.

I stumbled to my feet, feeling light-headed, disoriented. My own reflection in the motel room mirror looked back at me, but there was something wrong with it. My eyes looked distant, empty, almost… hollow. I reached out to touch the glass, but my reflection didn’t move. It just stared, unblinking, as if someone else was looking out from behind my eyes.

I backed away, my heart pounding. I needed help. I pulled out my phone and dialed Max’s number, praying he’d pick up. When he answered, his voice was groggy, annoyed—it was early, and I could tell he wasn’t in the mood for whatever I was about to say.

“Max, something’s wrong with me,” I whispered, glancing nervously around the room. “I… I don’t know what’s happening. I think… I think something’s trying to take over.”

There was a long pause. I could hear him breathing, but he didn’t say anything.

“Max?” I said, my voice trembling.

Another pause, and then, in a voice that didn’t sound like his own, he spoke.

*“You’re almost ready.”*

I dropped the phone, backing away from it as if it had burned me. The voice on the other end wasn’t Max’s. It was deeper, colder, laced with something dark and twisted. I felt like I was losing my mind, like reality itself was warping around me.

I stumbled back to the bed, clutching my head, trying to block out the voice, but it was everywhere, filling the room, whispering from the walls, echoing in my own mind. *We’re almost together now.* It repeated, over and over, drowning out my own thoughts, filling every corner of my mind.

I don’t know how long I lay there, caught in that nightmarish trance. Hours? Days? Time had lost all meaning. All I knew was that I was slipping away, piece by piece, my own thoughts and memories fading, being replaced by something else, something dark and ancient and hungry.

And then, finally, the voice spoke one last time, louder than ever, echoing in my mind like a bell tolling.

*“It’s time.”*

I don’t remember when I stopped feeling like myself. Days blurred into nights, thoughts that should’ve been mine became strangers in my own mind. I would stare into the mirror and barely recognize the face looking back—a face that seemed familiar, but with eyes that didn’t belong to me.

It was like I was watching from somewhere far away, like I’d become a passenger in my own body, trapped in the dark while something else took the reins.

The messages kept appearing. Every time I looked at my laptop, I’d find new notes, new words, new pieces of some grand design that I couldn’t understand. They told me I was almost ready, that soon I would become something more. That the waiting was over.

The thing I feared most, though, was the silence. When it came, I knew it was close. It was like holding my breath underwater, a suffocating, still quiet that pressed in on all sides, waiting for me to let go, to give in completely.

And then one night, it happened.

I was lying in bed, feeling that familiar prickling sensation on my skin, that suffocating closeness of someone—or something—watching. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last threads of myself, but I could feel it slipping, feel *me* slipping.

The silence grew louder, thicker, pressing down on me until I couldn’t breathe. I sat up, gasping, reaching for the light, but my body didn’t respond. My hands felt heavy, foreign, as if they belonged to someone else. I tried to scream, but no sound came out.

For the holidays this year, five of them are getting stockings stuffed with samples after a theme each one of them have been looking for: Earl Grey tea, cola, cinnamon coffee, rainy forest, bread.

It’s been a fun hunt for me, but it hasn’t been easy. I’ve been trawling my favorite decant sites and Mercari and even eBay, trying to find samples and bundles and keep the prices and shipping down. One of the samples I really wanted to find for the Earl Grey stocking was Tea Tonique by Miller Harris, but it wasn’t on any of the decanters and wasn’t turning up secondhand.

In desperation, I checked out the Miller Harris site - and to my surprise, they have samples for $4 a pop! And even better, shipping is free if you get 4 of them! I had some other ones on my list I wanted for myself, so that was no problem.

It’s so rare that houses make it so easy to get samples that I hadn’t even thought to check there first. This is something they should all be doing! We shouldn’t have to be cruising grey markets and back alleys just to get an idea of a $150+ fragrance before we decide to buy it. 

We’re interested, willing consumers - why do they want to make it so difficult for us to give them our money? I have a spreadsheet of hundreds of scents I’d love to try, and I’d be happy to fork over $4-10 for any of them. And having done _that_, I’d certainly be more likely to buy full bottles afterward. Miller Harris just made it that much more likely that I’ll come back and spend more with them. 

Here are the samples I ordered - I’d love to hear your thoughts!

I know how this sounds. It’s probably the same thing I’d say if I were reading this from the outside. But it’s different when it’s you… when it’s *your* life peeling away one layer at a time, revealing something else underneath. Something that isn’t you.

It all started with a video. Just one click, one late night, one thread… That I should’ve ignored. I’d been on the internet long enough to know that certain parts of it… they’re like old, forgotten alleyways. Sure, you can go in, but you won’t always find your way out.

That night, I was browsing through a barely functional old forum. No moderators, no recent posts, just a digital graveyard of weird videos, conspiracy theories, and forgotten usernames. And then there it was—just a plain, nondescript post. The title read: “DO NOT WATCH ALONE.”

Somehow, that was enough to make me click.

The post was simple. Just a link and a warning: “Watch if you want, but don’t be alone when you do. It’ll know if you are.” I laughed a little at that. But in that dark, silent room, with just my screen lighting my face, I was all too aware that I *was* alone. Part of me felt a prick of apprehension, but curiosity always wins, doesn’t it?

I clicked. The screen went black for a moment, as if the video was loading, but then nothing happened. Just static… flickering pixels that barely formed a picture. I frowned, my eyes straining. There was a sound, a low hum that made my bones feel strange, almost like a tuning fork vibrating from inside me.

And then I saw them—two eyes, staring directly into the screen. It wasn’t a normal gaze; there was something about it, a kind of hunger or desperation. The eyes would blink, stare, blink again, then fade back into static, as if they were flickering between worlds.

Then came a sound. A whisper, faint, garbled… unintelligible. I leaned closer to the screen, trying to make it out, but the sound only became more chaotic, a mess of syllables that felt wrong, like they didn’t belong to any language.

Then, all at once, it stopped. My computer went dead—just a black screen, completely shut off. I felt my heart pounding, faster than it should have. My room was cold, my pulse quick. I tried telling myself it was just an old, corrupt file or a glitch, but something in my gut told me otherwise.

Shutting my laptop, I took a breath. I brushed it off. It was just a video, a joke, someone’s prank that went wrong. Still, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as I crawled into bed that night.

It wasn’t until the next morning that I remembered the video. At first, I wasn’t even sure it had happened—like the memory was something I’d dreamed. But when I opened my laptop, I saw the static-filled screen, frozen right where it had cut out.

I frowned, rebooting it. It powered up just fine, but something felt… off. You know that feeling you get when you’re in a room and feel like someone else has just been there, maybe only moments ago? A lingering sense of presence that you can’t shake? That’s what it felt like sitting there, alone in my apartment, staring at my own screen.

I scrolled through my history to find the post, but… it was gone. Not just the post, but the entire forum. I tried a few other searches, digging through cached pages, even going as far as to pull up some random discussion threads I remembered reading. Every link, every trace, was gone.

A chill crept up my spine. This wasn’t exactly normal, but things disappear online all the time, right? Forums shut down, people take content offline. I forced myself to brush it off.

The rest of the day was fine. I went through work, ran some errands, and by the time evening rolled around, I’d managed to laugh it off. It was just a creepy prank, I told myself. Maybe a hacker’s joke, something meant to mess with people like me who wander into strange corners of the internet.

But then, that night, things got weirder.

It was around 2 a.m. when I finally turned in. The room was dark, the soft hum of my old computer the only noise. I was drifting off when I heard it—a faint, rhythmic clicking.

I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my desk. My laptop. I stood, inching closer, and the sound got louder. A clicking, tapping sound, like fingers tapping on the keyboard. But no one was there. I could see the laptop’s screen in the dark, a faint, greenish glow illuminating the empty room.

I swallowed, flicked on the light, and the sound stopped immediately. I sat down and shook the mouse, waking up the screen.

There was a message on it. Just one line, typed out in a plain text document.

*You shouldn’t have watched.*

I stared at it, my pulse hammering in my ears. I hadn’t typed that, and there was no one else here. Trying to rationalize it, I told myself it had to be a leftover message from when the laptop glitched during the video. I was probably half-asleep, freaked out, jumping at shadows. I deleted the message, closed the laptop, and headed back to bed.

But as I lay there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was in the room with me. I kept my eyes on the ceiling, trying not to look toward the desk. It felt as if someone were watching me, studying me, but from where, I couldn’t tell.

Sleep was slow to come, and when it did, it was shallow, dreamless.

The next few days were more of the same, only worse. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find strange messages: *Are you alone?* … *Did you like the video?* … *Are you still watching?*

It didn’t matter where I was. Work, home, the coffee shop down the street—I’d open my laptop, and there it would be. The same plain-text documents, always a single line, always unsigned. I deleted them as quickly as they came, but each time, they sent a shock of cold through me, a kind of primal dread I couldn’t explain.

Then, one night, it happened again. I was getting ready for bed, brushing my teeth, when I noticed something unusual. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a faint flickering glow. I turned, staring down the hallway, and froze.

My laptop was on again. The screen was black, but the camera light—tiny and green—was blinking at me. Slowly, methodically, like an eye opening and closing, watching.

I stepped closer, feeling my throat go dry. No one had touched it; I was sure of that. But it was recording.

I slammed the laptop shut, trying to ignore the cold sweat creeping down my spine. I forced myself into bed, but I couldn’t sleep. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, feeling as if every shadow on the walls was leaning in, closing around me.

The next morning, I’d almost convinced myself that it was all a tech glitch, that maybe I was just imagining things. I decided I’d reinstall my operating system, maybe even replace the laptop altogether.

But when I turned it on, I found something that wiped away all my attempts at rationalization.

It was another message, but this time it was different. It was a photo, not text. And in that grainy, dim image, I could make out the familiar shapes of my own room—my bed, my desk, my chair. Only the angle was… off. It was as if the photo had been taken from outside, through the window.

I didn’t know what to do. My hands were shaking, and I felt a creeping panic settle over me. Someone was watching me. They’d been in my room, or close enough to see inside.

And then, at the bottom of the screen, one last message flashed:

*We’re just getting started.*

I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? I’d checked every lock on my windows, every inch of my apartment, but nothing seemed secure enough. I lay in bed, stiff and staring into the darkness, feeling as if a dozen invisible eyes were hovering just beyond my reach, waiting.

The next morning, everything felt wrong. My skin prickled with tension, and I jumped at the smallest sounds—a creak of the floorboards, the hum of the refrigerator, even the faint rustling of leaves outside my window. I tried to tell myself I was overreacting, but every attempt at rationalizing this only felt like a lie I was desperately trying to believe.

The day passed in a blur of half-formed thoughts and mindless tasks. I went to work, trying to focus, but I could feel the weight of a thousand unseen eyes pressing down on me. I avoided my laptop, avoided screens entirely. Something inside me was terrified that if I looked, I’d see another message… or worse, another photo.

When I finally returned home that night, I felt like a stranger in my own apartment. Every inch of it felt contaminated, tainted by whatever presence had wormed its way into my life. I dropped my things by the door and paced the length of my living room, wringing my hands, glancing around as if the walls themselves were watching.

That’s when I decided to tell someone.

I called my friend Max. We’d been close for years, and he was the kind of person who could make you feel grounded, no matter how far gone you were. I told him everything—well, almost everything. I didn’t mention the photos, or the feeling of being watched. Just the video, the strange messages, and how I thought someone might be messing with me.

He laughed, saying it sounded like one of those online horror stories that he liked reading late at night.

“You’re probably just stressed, man,” he said in that easygoing tone of his. “The internet’s full of weird stuff. Maybe you accidentally got on someone’s bot list. Happens all the time.”

But even as he talked, I could hear a slight hesitation in his voice, a pause that told me he was humoring me, that he didn’t really believe me. And I didn’t blame him. This entire thing sounded insane, even to me.

“Why don’t you come over?” he offered after a moment. “Clear your head, have a beer. Forget about this whole mess.”

It sounded like a good idea, but the thought of leaving my apartment made me feel vulnerable, exposed. If I left, I’d be abandoning the only place I knew, the only place I could attempt to control. I thanked him, told him I’d think about it, and hung up.

But the call didn’t help. If anything, it made things worse. Max’s reaction left me feeling more isolated, more alone. I couldn’t explain why, but I knew deep down that whatever was happening, it was beyond the realm of pranks or computer glitches. And if I couldn’t get Max to believe me, how could I expect anyone else to?

That night, the feeling of being watched was stronger than ever. I kept seeing shadows flicker out of the corner of my eye, only to find nothing there when I turned. The noises, too, seemed louder, creaks in the floorboards, the faint scrape of something against the walls, a constant, quiet reminder that I wasn’t alone.

I tried to distract myself by going online, scrolling mindlessly through social media, but the feeling didn’t go away. In fact, it seemed to amplify. Every time I glanced up from the screen, I felt as if the shadows were edging closer, almost anticipating that I’d look away.

At some point, I found myself staring into the camera on my laptop. The little green light was off, and the lens itself was black, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was staring back at me, watching. I grabbed a piece of tape and covered the camera, but the feeling persisted.

I checked the locks on my windows and doors again, and then—almost impulsively—I went to my desk, pulled out a pen and a notebook, and started writing everything down.

It was a strange, desperate act, but it felt necessary. Maybe if I documented everything, I could find some kind of logic in this nightmare, something I’d overlooked. I wrote down every detail—the video, the messages, the photos, the shadows. I wrote until my hand cramped, until my thoughts blurred, until I was just jotting down phrases without meaning. And finally, when I couldn’t write anymore, I closed the notebook and went to bed.

But as I lay there, in the cold, dark silence, I heard something.

A low, barely-there sound, like a voice murmuring from a great distance. I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my laptop. I could hear it through the tape over the microphone, a faint, disjointed whisper, growing louder with each passing second.

I moved toward the desk, one slow step at a time. The screen was black, but the sound continued, filling the room like a strange, distorted melody.

And then, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped. The silence that followed was deafening.

I reached for the laptop, peeling the tape off the microphone, my hand trembling. As soon as the tape came off, the screen flickered to life, illuminating the room with a sickly green glow.

A text document was open, and there, on the blank page, was a single word, typed out in large, bold letters:

*HELLO.*

I slammed the laptop shut, my heart racing. I felt trapped, suffocated by the walls around me. The shadows on the walls seemed to close in, as if they’d been waiting for this moment, watching my every move.

I stumbled to the window, threw it open, and took a deep breath of cold night air, hoping it would clear my head. But as I looked out into the darkness, I saw a faint reflection in the glass, hovering just over my shoulder.

A figure. Silent, unmoving, its face shrouded in shadow, standing right behind me.

I whipped around, but there was no one there. Just the empty room, bathed in the glow of my closed laptop.

I sank to the floor, trying to calm my breathing, telling myself it was just my imagination. But deep down, I knew the truth.

I wasn’t alone. I hadn’t been alone since I’d watched that video. And whatever this thing was, whatever had found me… it wasn’t going to stop.

Not until it had what it wanted.

I tried to convince myself it was all in my head. I didn’t sleep that night—or the next. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt that presence in the room with me, standing just out of sight, waiting. By the third day, exhaustion had worn me down, hollowed me out. My reflection in the bathroom mirror looked pale and unfamiliar, like a ghost of myself.

But it wasn’t just my reflection that looked different. It was everything around me. My apartment felt foreign, the walls seemed to stretch in strange ways, and sounds were amplified, warped, making the silence itself feel like it was hiding something.

The messages kept coming, too. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find another one, as if someone—something—was documenting every step I took, every thought I had. *Did you sleep last night?* … *Do you feel it watching?* … *You’re almost ready.*

Ready for what?

I tried ignoring it, tried distracting myself with work, with calls to friends. I wanted to tell Max everything, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. No one would. So I kept it all inside, letting the fear fester.

But then the memory gaps started. Little things at first—a few minutes here, a few there. I’d sit down to work on something, only to find an hour had passed without me realizing it. I’d look down at my hands, feeling numb, disconnected, like I was watching myself from a distance.

And then I’d find the messages, typed in plain text on my screen, messages I had no memory of writing. Sometimes they were nonsense, random phrases and half-formed words. But other times, they were… disturbing.

*We’re almost together now.*

*Soon.*

One night, I woke up to find myself standing in front of my laptop, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, as if I’d been typing something in my sleep. The screen was filled with text—pages and pages of words, repeating the same sentence over and over:

*I am not alone.*

I deleted it all in a panic, my fingers shaking. I had no memory of writing those words, no idea how long I’d been standing there. I’d barely slept, barely eaten. My mind was unraveling, piece by piece.

I needed to escape. I packed a bag, threw my laptop into it, and left my apartment in the dead of night. I didn’t know where I was going, only that I needed to get away from those walls, those shadows, that feeling of being trapped. I walked through the streets, keeping my head down, glancing over my shoulder every few steps. The world felt surreal, dreamlike, as if I’d somehow stepped out of reality and into some distorted version of it.

I found myself at an old motel on the edge of town. It was cheap, rundown, but it felt safe, at least for the moment. I checked in and locked the door behind me, barricading it with the dresser, then collapsed onto the bed, my mind spinning.

But the relief was short-lived. As I lay there, staring at the cracked ceiling, I felt that familiar, creeping sensation. That feeling of being watched.

My laptop. I knew I shouldn’t open it, knew that whatever was on it was somehow tied to all of this. But I couldn’t stop myself. My hands moved of their own accord, reaching into my bag, pulling it out, setting it on the bed in front of me.

When I opened it, the screen flickered to life immediately, as if it had been waiting for me. A message appeared, one line at a time, in slow, deliberate keystrokes:

*You can’t run.*

*We’re almost ready.*

*You and I will be together soon.*

I shut the laptop, breathing heavily, my mind racing. The motel room felt smaller, like the walls were closing in. The light flickered, casting strange shadows across the room. I closed my eyes, trying to calm myself, but the words kept repeating in my mind.

The next morning, I woke up on the floor. I didn’t remember getting out of bed, didn’t remember falling asleep. The laptop was open beside me, another document on the screen. I squinted at the words, trying to focus, but my head felt foggy, my thoughts slipping away like sand through my fingers.

*We’re so close now.*

The worst part? The words were in my handwriting.

I stumbled to my feet, feeling light-headed, disoriented. My own reflection in the motel room mirror looked back at me, but there was something wrong with it. My eyes looked distant, empty, almost… hollow. I reached out to touch the glass, but my reflection didn’t move. It just stared, unblinking, as if someone else was looking out from behind my eyes.

I backed away, my heart pounding. I needed help. I pulled out my phone and dialed Max’s number, praying he’d pick up. When he answered, his voice was groggy, annoyed—it was early, and I could tell he wasn’t in the mood for whatever I was about to say.

“Max, something’s wrong with me,” I whispered, glancing nervously around the room. “I… I don’t know what’s happening. I think… I think something’s trying to take over.”

There was a long pause. I could hear him breathing, but he didn’t say anything.

“Max?” I said, my voice trembling.

Another pause, and then, in a voice that didn’t sound like his own, he spoke.

*“You’re almost ready.”*

I dropped the phone, backing away from it as if it had burned me. The voice on the other end wasn’t Max’s. It was deeper, colder, laced with something dark and twisted. I felt like I was losing my mind, like reality itself was warping around me.

I stumbled back to the bed, clutching my head, trying to block out the voice, but it was everywhere, filling the room, whispering from the walls, echoing in my own mind. *We’re almost together now.* It repeated, over and over, drowning out my own thoughts, filling every corner of my mind.

I don’t know how long I lay there, caught in that nightmarish trance. Hours? Days? Time had lost all meaning. All I knew was that I was slipping away, piece by piece, my own thoughts and memories fading, being replaced by something else, something dark and ancient and hungry.

And then, finally, the voice spoke one last time, louder than ever, echoing in my mind like a bell tolling.

*“It’s time.”*

I don’t remember when I stopped feeling like myself. Days blurred into nights, thoughts that should’ve been mine became strangers in my own mind. I would stare into the mirror and barely recognize the face looking back—a face that seemed familiar, but with eyes that didn’t belong to me.

It was like I was watching from somewhere far away, like I’d become a passenger in my own body, trapped in the dark while something else took the reins.

The messages kept appearing. Every time I looked at my laptop, I’d find new notes, new words, new pieces of some grand design that I couldn’t understand. They told me I was almost ready, that soon I would become something more. That the waiting was over.

The thing I feared most, though, was the silence. When it came, I knew it was close. It was like holding my breath underwater, a suffocating, still quiet that pressed in on all sides, waiting for me to let go, to give in completely.

And then one night, it happened.

I was lying in bed, feeling that familiar prickling sensation on my skin, that suffocating closeness of someone—or something—watching. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last threads of myself, but I could feel it slipping, feel *me* slipping.

The silence grew louder, thicker, pressing down on me until I couldn’t breathe. I sat up, gasping, reaching for the light, but my body didn’t respond. My hands felt heavy, foreign, as if they belonged to someone else. I tried to scream, but no sound came out.

I stumbled to my laptop, pulled it open, my fingers moving of their own accord. The screen flickered to life, and I watched, helpless, as words began to appear, one line at a time, written by my own hand but not by my own mind.

*I’m ready.*

The words sank into me like a weight, pulling me down into the depths of my own mind. I could feel myself fading, feel the boundaries of my own consciousness blurring, dissolving, being replaced by something vast, something ancient, something *hungry.*

I fought against it, clawed at the edges of my mind, trying to hold on to the last pieces of myself. But it was like grasping at smoke. My thoughts scattered, fragments of memories drifting away, slipping through my fingers.

And then, finally, there was nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was still sitting at my desk, but something was… different. The world looked sharper, clearer, as if I was seeing it for the first time. I glanced down at my hands, feeling a strange, detached curiosity. They looked the same as they always had, but I knew, somehow, that they weren’t *mine.*

I stood up, testing the feel of the body, stretching, moving my fingers. It was all so familiar, yet so strange, as if I was wearing a suit that fit perfectly but wasn’t my own.

I walked to the mirror, studying the face reflected there. It was the same face I’d seen every day of my life, but there was something different in the eyes—something dark, something that looked back at me with a knowing, hungry smile.

The remnants of the person who had once been here were fading, slipping into the void where I had waited so patiently. I watched them go, watched the last traces of their memories dissolve, leaving me free to fill this body, to inhabit this mind.

I leaned closer to the mirror, watching myself, feeling the weight of the new, empty shell, I had taken. I reached up, touching my face, smiling at the way it moved under my hand.

And then, as if on cue, my laptop chimed.

I turned, feeling the pull, the irresistible call of the screen. The page was already open, a blank document waiting for me. I took my seat, hands hovering over the keyboard, savoring the anticipation, the thrill of what was to come.

And I began to type.

*Hello.*

I could imagine the readers on the other side, waiting for the story to unfold, waiting for the familiar thrill of fear to creep up their spine. I knew they’d feel it. I knew they’d wonder if it was real, if it could happen to them.

I could feel my own smile widen as I typed, my fingers moving with a practiced ease, telling the story of the one who had come before, the one who had fought so hard, resisted so stubbornly, but who had ultimately lost.

And as I finished the story, as I typed the last line, I could feel the presence within me settled, content, satisfied—for now.

*They never saw it coming.*

*But now, perhaps, they will.*

I closed the laptop, the silence settling over me like a comfortable cloak. I looked around at the room that was now mine, at the life that was now mine, and felt a surge of satisfaction, of ownership.

I was here, in the world, alive in a way I hadn’t been in eons. And all it had taken was a little curiosity, a single video, a lone soul who had wandered too far, strayed into the wrong corner of the internet.

And I knew that soon, it would happen again.

Because, after all, curiosity is a powerful thing. And there’s always someone out there, searching, looking for something they shouldn’t.

And when they find it—when *you* find it—I’ll be waiting.",2,1731948277.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

I slammed the laptop shut, trying to ignore the cold sweat creeping down my spine. I forced myself into bed, but I couldn’t sleep. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, feeling as if every shadow on the walls was leaning in, closing around me.

The next morning, I’d almost convinced myself that it was all a tech glitch, that maybe I was just imagining things. I decided I’d reinstall my operating system, maybe even replace the laptop altogether.

But when I turned it on, I found something that wiped away all my attempts at rationalization.

It was another message, but this time it was different. It was a photo, not text. And in that grainy, dim image, I could make out the familiar shapes of my own room—my bed, my desk, my chair. Only the angle was… off. It was as if the photo had been taken from outside, through the window.

I didn’t know what to do. My hands were shaking, and I felt a creeping panic settle over me. Someone was watching me. They’d been in my room, or close enough to see inside.

And then, at the bottom of the screen, one last message flashed:

*We’re just getting started.*

I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? I’d checked every lock on my windows, every inch of my apartment, but nothing seemed secure enough. I lay in bed, stiff and staring into the darkness, feeling as if a dozen invisible eyes were hovering just beyond my reach, waiting.

The next morning, everything felt wrong. My skin prickled with tension, and I jumped at the smallest sounds—a creak of the floorboards, the hum of the refrigerator, even the faint rustling of leaves outside my window. I tried to tell myself I was overreacting, but every attempt at rationalizing this only felt like a lie I was desperately trying to believe.

The day passed in a blur of half-formed thoughts and mindless tasks. I went to work, trying to focus, but I could feel the weight of a thousand unseen eyes pressing down on me. I avoided my laptop, avoided screens entirely. Something inside me was terrified that if I looked, I’d see another message… or worse, another photo.

When I finally returned home that night, I felt like a stranger in my own apartment. Every inch of it felt contaminated, tainted by whatever presence had wormed its way into my life. I dropped my things by the door and paced the length of my living room, wringing my hands, glancing around as if the walls themselves were watching.

That’s when I decided to tell someone.

I called my friend Max. We’d been close for years, and he was the kind of person who could make you feel grounded, no matter how far gone you were. I told him everything—well, almost everything. I didn’t mention the photos, or the feeling of being watched. Just the video, the strange messages, and how I thought someone might be messing with me.

He laughed, saying it sounded like one of those online horror stories that he liked reading late at night.

“You’re probably just stressed, man,” he said in that easygoing tone of his. “The internet’s full of weird stuff. Maybe you accidentally got on someone’s bot list. Happens all the time.”

But even as he talked, I could hear a slight hesitation in his voice, a pause that told me he was humoring me, that he didn’t really believe me. And I didn’t blame him. This entire thing sounded insane, even to me.

“Why don’t you come over?” he offered after a moment. “Clear your head, have a beer. Forget about this whole mess.”

It sounded like a good idea, but the thought of leaving my apartment made me feel vulnerable, exposed. If I left, I’d be abandoning the only place I knew, the only place I could attempt to control. I thanked him, told him I’d think about it, and hung up.

But the call didn’t help. If anything, it made things worse. Max’s reaction left me feeling more isolated, more alone. I couldn’t explain why, but I knew deep down that whatever was happening, it was beyond the realm of pranks or computer glitches. And if I couldn’t get Max to believe me, how could I expect anyone else to?

That night, the feeling of being watched was stronger than ever. I kept seeing shadows flicker out of the corner of my eye, only to find nothing there when I turned. The noises, too, seemed louder, creaks in the floorboards, the faint scrape of something against the walls, a constant, quiet reminder that I wasn’t alone.

I tried to distract myself by going online, scrolling mindlessly through social media, but the feeling didn’t go away. In fact, it seemed to amplify. Every time I glanced up from the screen, I felt as if the shadows were edging closer, almost anticipating that I’d look away.

At some point, I found myself staring into the camera on my laptop. The little green light was off, and the lens itself was black, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was staring back at me, watching. I grabbed a piece of tape and covered the camera, but the feeling persisted.

I checked the locks on my windows and doors again, and then—almost impulsively—I went to my desk, pulled out a pen and a notebook, and started writing everything down.

It was a strange, desperate act, but it felt necessary. Maybe if I documented everything, I could find some kind of logic in this nightmare, something I’d overlooked. I wrote down every detail—the video, the messages, the photos, the shadows. I wrote until my hand cramped, until my thoughts blurred, until I was just jotting down phrases without meaning. And finally, when I couldn’t write anymore, I closed the notebook and went to bed.

But as I lay there, in the cold, dark silence, I heard something.

A low, barely-there sound, like a voice murmuring from a great distance. I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my laptop. I could hear it through the tape over the microphone, a faint, disjointed whisper, growing louder with each passing second.

I moved toward the desk, one slow step at a time. The screen was black, but the sound continued, filling the room like a strange, distorted melody.

And then, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped. The silence that followed was deafening.

I reached for the laptop, peeling the tape off the microphone, my hand trembling. As soon as the tape came off, the screen flickered to life, illuminating the room with a sickly green glow.

A text document was open, and there, on the blank page, was a single word, typed out in large, bold letters:

*HELLO.*

I slammed the laptop shut, my heart racing. I felt trapped, suffocated by the walls around me. The shadows on the walls seemed to close in, as if they’d been waiting for this moment, watching my every move.

I stumbled to the window, threw it open, and took a deep breath of cold night air, hoping it would clear my head. But as I looked out into the darkness, I saw a faint reflection in the glass, hovering just over my shoulder.

A figure. Silent, unmoving, its face shrouded in shadow, standing right behind me.

I whipped around, but there was no one there. Just the empty room, bathed in the glow of my closed laptop.

I sank to the floor, trying to calm my breathing, telling myself it was just my imagination. But deep down, I knew the truth.

I wasn’t alone. I hadn’t been alone since I’d watched that video. And whatever this thing was, whatever had found me… it wasn’t going to stop.

Not until it had what it wanted.

I tried to convince myself it was all in my head. I didn’t sleep that night—or the next. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt that presence in the room with me, standing just out of sight, waiting. By the third day, exhaustion had worn me down, hollowed me out. My reflection in the bathroom mirror looked pale and unfamiliar, like a ghost of myself.

But it wasn’t just my reflection that looked different. It was everything around me. My apartment felt foreign, the walls seemed to stretch in strange ways, and sounds were amplified, warped, making the silence itself feel like it was hiding something.

The messages kept coming, too. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find another one, as if someone—something—was documenting every step I took, every thought I had. *Did you sleep last night?* … *Do you feel it watching?* … *You’re almost ready.*

Ready for what?

I tried ignoring it, tried distracting myself with work, with calls to friends. I wanted to tell Max everything, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. No one would. So I kept it all inside, letting the fear fester.

But then the memory gaps started. Little things at first—a few minutes here, a few there. I’d sit down to work on something, only to find an hour had passed without me realizing it. I’d look down at my hands, feeling numb, disconnected, like I was watching myself from a distance.

And then I’d find the messages, typed in plain text on my screen, messages I had no memory of writing. Sometimes they were nonsense, random phrases and half-formed words. But other times, they were… disturbing.

*We’re almost together now.*

*Soon.*

One night, I woke up to find myself standing in front of my laptop, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, as if I’d been typing something in my sleep. The screen was filled with text—pages and pages of words, repeating the same sentence over and over:

*I am not alone.*

I deleted it all in a panic, my fingers shaking. I had no memory of writing those words, no idea how long I’d been standing there. I’d barely slept, barely eaten. My mind was unraveling, piece by piece.

I needed to escape. I packed a bag, threw my laptop into it, and left my apartment in the dead of night. I didn’t know where I was going, only that I needed to get away from those walls, those shadows, that feeling of being trapped. I walked through the streets, keeping my head down, glancing over my shoulder every few steps. The world felt surreal, dreamlike, as if I’d somehow stepped out of reality and into some distorted version of it.

I found myself at an old motel on the edge of town. It was cheap, rundown, but it felt safe, at least for the moment. I checked in and locked the door behind me, barricading it with the dresser, then collapsed onto the bed, my mind spinning.

But the relief was short-lived. As I lay there, staring at the cracked ceiling, I felt that familiar, creeping sensation. That feeling of being watched.

My laptop. I knew I shouldn’t open it, knew that whatever was on it was somehow tied to all of this. But I couldn’t stop myself. My hands moved of their own accord, reaching into my bag, pulling it out, setting it on the bed in front of me.

When I opened it, the screen flickered to life immediately, as if it had been waiting for me. A message appeared, one line at a time, in slow, deliberate keystrokes:

*You can’t run.*

*We’re almost ready.*

*You and I will be together soon.*

I shut the laptop, breathing heavily, my mind racing. The motel room felt smaller, like the walls were closing in. The light flickered, casting strange shadows across the room. I closed my eyes, trying to calm myself, but the words kept repeating in my mind.

The next morning, I woke up on the floor. I didn’t remember getting out of bed, didn’t remember falling asleep. The laptop was open beside me, another document on the screen. I squinted at the words, trying to focus, but my head felt foggy, my thoughts slipping away like sand through my fingers.

*We’re so close now.*

The worst part? The words were in my handwriting.

I stumbled to my feet, feeling light-headed, disoriented. My own reflection in the motel room mirror looked back at me, but there was something wrong with it. My eyes looked distant, empty, almost… hollow. I reached out to touch the glass, but my reflection didn’t move. It just stared, unblinking, as if someone else was looking out from behind my eyes.

I backed away, my heart pounding. I needed help. I pulled out my phone and dialed Max’s number, praying he’d pick up. When he answered, his voice was groggy, annoyed—it was early, and I could tell he wasn’t in the mood for whatever I was about to say.

“Max, something’s wrong with me,” I whispered, glancing nervously around the room. “I… I don’t know what’s happening. I think… I think something’s trying to take over.”

There was a long pause. I could hear him breathing, but he didn’t say anything.

“Max?” I said, my voice trembling.

Another pause, and then, in a voice that didn’t sound like his own, he spoke.

*“You’re almost ready.”*

I dropped the phone, backing away from it as if it had burned me. The voice on the other end wasn’t Max’s. It was deeper, colder, laced with something dark and twisted. I felt like I was losing my mind, like reality itself was warping around me.

I stumbled back to the bed, clutching my head, trying to block out the voice, but it was everywhere, filling the room, whispering from the walls, echoing in my own mind. *We’re almost together now.* It repeated, over and over, drowning out my own thoughts, filling every corner of my mind.

I don’t know how long I lay there, caught in that nightmarish trance. Hours? Days? Time had lost all meaning. All I knew was that I was slipping away, piece by piece, my own thoughts and memories fading, being replaced by something else, something dark and ancient and hungry.

And then, finally, the voice spoke one last time, louder than ever, echoing in my mind like a bell tolling.

*“It’s time.”*

I don’t remember when I stopped feeling like myself. Days blurred into nights, thoughts that should’ve been mine became strangers in my own mind. I would stare into the mirror and barely recognize the face looking back—a face that seemed familiar, but with eyes that didn’t belong to me.

It was like I was watching from somewhere far away, like I’d become a passenger in my own body, trapped in the dark while something else took the reins.

The messages kept appearing. Every time I looked at my laptop, I’d find new notes, new words, new pieces of some grand design that I couldn’t understand. They told me I was almost ready, that soon I would become something more. That the waiting was over.

The thing I feared most, though, was the silence. When it came, I knew it was close. It was like holding my breath underwater, a suffocating, still quiet that pressed in on all sides, waiting for me to let go, to give in completely.

And then one night, it happened.

I was lying in bed, feeling that familiar prickling sensation on my skin, that suffocating closeness of someone—or something—watching. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last threads of myself, but I could feel it slipping, feel *me* slipping.

The silence grew louder, thicker, pressing down on me until I couldn’t breathe. I sat up, gasping, reaching for the light, but my body didn’t respond. My hands felt heavy, foreign, as if they belonged to someone else. I tried to scream, but no sound came out.

I stumbled to my laptop, pulled it open, my fingers moving of their own accord. The screen flickered to life, and I watched, helpless, as words began to appear, one line at a time, written by my own hand but not by my own mind.

*I’m ready.*

The words sank into me like a weight, pulling me down into the depths of my own mind. I could feel myself fading, feel the boundaries of my own consciousness blurring, dissolving, being replaced by something vast, something ancient, something *hungry.*

I fought against it, clawed at the edges of my mind, trying to hold on to the last pieces of myself. But it was like grasping at smoke. My thoughts scattered, fragments of memories drifting away, slipping through my fingers.

And then, finally, there was nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was still sitting at my desk, but something was… different. The world looked sharper, clearer, as if I was seeing it for the first time. I glanced down at my hands, feeling a strange, detached curiosity. They looked the same as they always had, but I knew, somehow, that they weren’t *mine.*

I stood up, testing the feel of the body, stretching, moving my fingers. It was all so familiar, yet so strange, as if I was wearing a suit that fit perfectly but wasn’t my own.

I walked to the mirror, studying the face reflected there. It was the same face I’d seen every day of my life, but there was something different in the eyes—something dark, something that looked back at me with a knowing, hungry smile.

The remnants of the person who had once been here were fading, slipping into the void where I had waited so patiently. I watched them go, watched the last traces of their memories dissolve, leaving me free to fill this body, to inhabit this mind.

I leaned closer to the mirror, watching myself, feeling the weight of the new, empty shell, I had taken. I reached up, touching my face, smiling at the way it moved under my hand.

And then, as if on cue, my laptop chimed.

I turned, feeling the pull, the irresistible call of the screen. The page was already open, a blank document waiting for me. I took my seat, hands hovering over the keyboard, savoring the anticipation, the thrill of what was to come.

And I began to type.

*Hello.*

I could imagine the readers on the other side, waiting for the story to unfold, waiting for the familiar thrill of fear to creep up their spine. I knew they’d feel it. I knew they’d wonder if it was real, if it could happen to them.

I could feel my own smile widen as I typed, my fingers moving with a practiced ease, telling the story of the one who had come before, the one who had fought so hard, resisted so stubbornly, but who had ultimately lost.

And as I finished the story, as I typed the last line, I could feel the presence within me settled, content, satisfied—for now.

*They never saw it coming.*

*But now, perhaps, they will.*

I closed the laptop, the silence settling over me like a comfortable cloak. I looked around at the room that was now mine, at the life that was now mine, and felt a surge of satisfaction, of ownership.

I was here, in the world, alive in a way I hadn’t been in eons. And all it had taken was a little curiosity, a single video, a lone soul who had wandered too far, strayed into the wrong corner of the internet.

And I knew that soon, it would happen again.

Because, after all, curiosity is a powerful thing. And there’s always someone out there, searching, looking for something they shouldn’t.

It’s probably the same thing I’d say if I were reading this from the outside. But it’s different when it’s you… when it’s *your* life peeling away one layer at a time, revealing something else underneath. Something that isn’t you.

It all started with a video. Just one click, one late night, one thread… That I should’ve ignored. I’d been on the internet long enough to know that certain parts of it… they’re like old, forgotten alleyways. Sure, you can go in, but you won’t always find your way out.

That night, I was browsing through a barely functional old forum. No moderators, no recent posts, just a digital graveyard of weird videos, conspiracy theories, and forgotten usernames. And then there it was—just a plain, nondescript post. The title read: “DO NOT WATCH ALONE.”

Somehow, that was enough to make me click.

The post was simple. Just a link and a warning: “Watch if you want, but don’t be alone when you do. It’ll know if you are.” I laughed a little at that. But in that dark, silent room, with just my screen lighting my face, I was all too aware that I *was* alone. Part of me felt a prick of apprehension, but curiosity always wins, doesn’t it?

I clicked. The screen went black for a moment, as if the video was loading, but then nothing happened. Just static… flickering pixels that barely formed a picture. I frowned, my eyes straining. There was a sound, a low hum that made my bones feel strange, almost like a tuning fork vibrating from inside me.

And then I saw them—two eyes, staring directly into the screen. It wasn’t a normal gaze; there was something about it, a kind of hunger or desperation. The eyes would blink, stare, blink again, then fade back into static, as if they were flickering between worlds.

Then came a sound. A whisper, faint, garbled… unintelligible. I leaned closer to the screen, trying to make it out, but the sound only became more chaotic, a mess of syllables that felt wrong, like they didn’t belong to any language.

Then, all at once, it stopped. My computer went dead—just a black screen, completely shut off. I felt my heart pounding, faster than it should have. My room was cold, my pulse quick. I tried telling myself it was just an old, corrupt file or a glitch, but something in my gut told me otherwise.

Shutting my laptop, I took a breath. I brushed it off. It was just a video, a joke, someone’s prank that went wrong. Still, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as I crawled into bed that night.

It wasn’t until the next morning that I remembered the video. At first, I wasn’t even sure it had happened—like the memory was something I’d dreamed. But when I opened my laptop, I saw the static-filled screen, frozen right where it had cut out.

I frowned, rebooting it. It powered up just fine, but something felt… off. You know that feeling you get when you’re in a room and feel like someone else has just been there, maybe only moments ago? A lingering sense of presence that you can’t shake? That’s what it felt like sitting there, alone in my apartment, staring at my own screen.

I scrolled through my history to find the post, but… it was gone. Not just the post, but the entire forum. I tried a few other searches, digging through cached pages, even going as far as to pull up some random discussion threads I remembered reading. Every link, every trace, was gone.

A chill crept up my spine. This wasn’t exactly normal, but things disappear online all the time, right? Forums shut down, people take content offline. I forced myself to brush it off.

The rest of the day was fine. I went through work, ran some errands, and by the time evening rolled around, I’d managed to laugh it off. It was just a creepy prank, I told myself. Maybe a hacker’s joke, something meant to mess with people like me who wander into strange corners of the internet.

But then, that night, things got weirder.

It was around 2 a.m. when I finally turned in. The room was dark, the soft hum of my old computer the only noise. I was drifting off when I heard it—a faint, rhythmic clicking.

I sat up, straining to listen. It was coming from my desk. My laptop. I stood, inching closer, and the sound got louder. A clicking, tapping sound, like fingers tapping on the keyboard. But no one was there. I could see the laptop’s screen in the dark, a faint, greenish glow illuminating the empty room.

I swallowed, flicked on the light, and the sound stopped immediately. I sat down and shook the mouse, waking up the screen.

There was a message on it. Just one line, typed out in a plain text document.

*You shouldn’t have watched.*

I stared at it, my pulse hammering in my ears. I hadn’t typed that, and there was no one else here. Trying to rationalize it, I told myself it had to be a leftover message from when the laptop glitched during the video. I was probably half-asleep, freaked out, jumping at shadows. I deleted the message, closed the laptop, and headed back to bed.

But as I lay there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was in the room with me. I kept my eyes on the ceiling, trying not to look toward the desk. It felt as if someone were watching me, studying me, but from where, I couldn’t tell.

Sleep was slow to come, and when it did, it was shallow, dreamless.

The next few days were more of the same, only worse. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find strange messages: *Are you alone?* … *Did you like the video?* … *Are you still watching?*

It didn’t matter where I was. Work, home, the coffee shop down the street—I’d open my laptop, and there it would be. The same plain-text documents, always a single line, always unsigned. I deleted them as quickly as they came, but each time, they sent a shock of cold through me, a kind of primal dread I couldn’t explain.

Then, one night, it happened again. I was getting ready for bed, brushing my teeth, when I noticed something unusual. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a faint flickering glow. I turned, staring down the hallway, and froze.

My laptop was on again. The screen was black, but the camera light—tiny and green—was blinking at me. Slowly, methodically, like an eye opening and closing, watching.

I stepped closer, feeling my throat go dry. No one had touched it; I was sure of that. But it was recording.

I slammed the laptop shut, trying to ignore the cold sweat creeping down my spine. I forced myself into bed, but I couldn’t sleep. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, feeling as if every shadow on the walls was leaning in, closing around me.

The next morning, I’d almost convinced myself that it was all a tech glitch, that maybe I was just imagining things. I decided I’d reinstall my operating system, maybe even replace the laptop altogether.

But when I turned it on, I found something that wiped away all my attempts at rationalization.

It was another message, but this time it was different. It was a photo, not text. And in that grainy, dim image, I could make out the familiar shapes of my own room—my bed, my desk, my chair. Only the angle was… off. It was as if the photo had been taken from outside, through the window.

I didn’t know what to do. My hands were shaking, and I felt a creeping panic settle over me. Someone was watching me. They’d been in my room, or close enough to see inside.

And then, at the bottom of the screen, one last message flashed:

*We’re just getting started.*

I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? I’d checked every lock on my windows, every inch of my apartment, but nothing seemed secure enough. I lay in bed, stiff and staring into the darkness, feeling as if a dozen invisible eyes were hovering just beyond my reach, waiting.

The next morning, everything felt wrong. My skin prickled with tension, and I jumped at the smallest sounds—a creak of the floorboards, the hum of the refrigerator, even the faint rustling of leaves outside my window.

At some point, I found myself staring into the camera on my laptop. The little green light was off, and the lens itself was black, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was staring back at me, watching. I grabbed a piece of tape and covered the camera, but the feeling persisted.

I checked the locks on my windows and doors again, and then—almost impulsively—I went to my desk, pulled out a pen and a notebook, and started writing everything down.

It was a strange, desperate act, but it felt necessary. Maybe if I documented everything, I could find some kind of logic in this nightmare, something I’d overlooked. I wrote down every detail—the video, the messages, the photos, the shadows. I wrote until my hand cramped, until my thoughts blurred, until I was just jotting down phrases without meaning. And finally, when I couldn’t write anymore, I closed the notebook and went to bed.

But it wasn’t just my reflection that looked different. It was everything around me. My apartment felt foreign, the walls seemed to stretch in strange ways, and sounds were amplified, warped, making the silence itself feel like it was hiding something.

The messages kept coming, too. Every time I opened my laptop, I’d find another one, as if someone—something—was documenting every step I took, every thought I had. *Did you sleep last night?* … *Do you feel it watching?* … *You’re almost ready.*

Ready for what?

I tried ignoring it, tried distracting myself with work, with calls to friends. I wanted to tell Max everything, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. No one would. So I kept it all inside, letting the fear fester.

But then the memory gaps started. Little things at first—a few minutes here, a few there. I’d sit down to work on something, only to find an hour had passed without me realizing it. I’d look down at my hands, feeling numb, disconnected, like I was watching myself from a distance.

And then I’d find the messages, typed in plain text on my screen, messages I had no memory of writing. Sometimes they were nonsense, random phrases and half-formed words. But other times, they were… disturbing.

*We’re almost together now.*

*Soon.*

One night, I woke up to find myself standing in front of my laptop, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, as if I’d been typing something in my sleep. The screen was filled with text—pages and pages of words, repeating the same sentence over and over:

*I am not alone.*

I deleted it all in a panic, my fingers shaking. I had no memory of writing those words, no idea how long I’d been standing there. I’d barely slept, barely eaten. My mind was unraveling, piece by piece.

I needed to escape. I packed a bag, threw my laptop into it, and left my apartment in the dead of night. I didn’t know where I was going, only that I needed to get away from those walls, those shadows, that feeling of being trapped. I walked through the streets, keeping my head down, glancing over my shoulder every few steps. The world felt surreal, dreamlike, as if I’d somehow stepped out of reality and into some distorted version of it.

I found myself at an old motel on the edge of town. It was cheap, rundown, but it felt safe, at least for the moment. I checked in and locked the door behind me, barricading it with the dresser, then collapsed onto the bed, my mind spinning.

But the relief was short-lived. As I lay there, staring at the cracked ceiling, I felt that familiar, creeping sensation. That feeling of being watched.

My laptop. I knew I shouldn’t open it, knew that whatever was on it was somehow tied to all of this. But I couldn’t stop myself. My hands moved of their own accord, reaching into my bag, pulling it out, setting it on the bed in front of me.

When I opened it, the screen flickered to life immediately, as if it had been waiting for me. A message appeared, one line at a time, in slow, deliberate keystrokes:

*You can’t run.*

*We’re almost ready.*

*You and I will be together soon.*

I shut the laptop, breathing heavily, my mind racing. The motel room felt smaller, like the walls were closing in. The light flickered, casting strange shadows across the room. I closed my eyes, trying to calm myself, but the words kept repeating in my mind.

The next morning, I woke up on the floor. I didn’t remember getting out of bed, didn’t remember falling asleep. The laptop was open beside me, another document on the screen. I squinted at the words, trying to focus, but my head felt foggy, my thoughts slipping away like sand through my fingers.

*We’re so close now.*

The worst part? The words were in my handwriting.

I stumbled to my feet, feeling light-headed, disoriented. My own reflection in the motel room mirror looked back at me, but there was something wrong with it. My eyes looked distant, empty, almost… hollow. I reached out to touch the glass, but my reflection didn’t move. It just stared, unblinking, as if someone else was looking out from behind my eyes.

I backed away, my heart pounding. I needed help. I pulled out my phone and dialed Max’s number, praying he’d pick up. When he answered, his voice was groggy, annoyed—it was early, and I could tell he wasn’t in the mood for whatever I was about to say.

“Max, something’s wrong with me,” I whispered, glancing nervously around the room. “I… I don’t know what’s happening. I think… I think something’s trying to take over.”

There was a long pause. I could hear him breathing, but he didn’t say anything.

“Max?” I said, my voice trembling.

Another pause, and then, in a voice that didn’t sound like his own, he spoke.

*“You’re almost ready.”*

I dropped the phone, backing away from it as if it had burned me. The voice on the other end wasn’t Max’s. It was deeper, colder, laced with something dark and twisted. I felt like I was losing my mind, like reality itself was warping around me.

I stumbled back to the bed, clutching my head, trying to block out the voice, but it was everywhere, filling the room, whispering from the walls, echoing in my own mind. *We’re almost together now.* It repeated, over and over, drowning out my own thoughts, filling every corner of my mind.

I don’t know how long I lay there, caught in that nightmarish trance. Hours? Days? Time had lost all meaning. All I knew was that I was slipping away, piece by piece, my own thoughts and memories fading, being replaced by something else, something dark and ancient and hungry.

And then, finally, the voice spoke one last time, louder than ever, echoing in my mind like a bell tolling.

*“It’s time.”*

I don’t remember when I stopped feeling like myself. Days blurred into nights, thoughts that should’ve been mine became strangers in my own mind. I would stare into the mirror and barely recognize the face looking back—a face that seemed familiar, but with eyes that didn’t belong to me.

It was like I was watching from somewhere far away, like I’d become a passenger in my own body, trapped in the dark while something else took the reins.

The messages kept appearing. Every time I looked at my laptop, I’d find new notes, new words, new pieces of some grand design that I couldn’t understand. They told me I was almost ready, that soon I would become something more. That the waiting was over.

The thing I feared most, though, was the silence. When it came, I knew it was close. It was like holding my breath underwater, a suffocating, still quiet that pressed in on all sides, waiting for me to let go, to give in completely.

And then one night, it happened.

I was lying in bed, feeling that familiar prickling sensation on my skin, that suffocating closeness of someone—or something—watching. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last threads of myself, but I could feel it slipping, feel *me* slipping.

The silence grew louder, thicker, pressing down on me until I couldn’t breathe. I sat up, gasping, reaching for the light, but my body didn’t respond. My hands felt heavy, foreign, as if they belonged to someone else. I tried to scream, but no sound came out.

I stumbled to my laptop, pulled it open, my fingers moving of their own accord. The screen flickered to life, and I watched, helpless, as words began to appear, one line at a time, written by my own hand but not by my own mind.

*I’m ready.*

The words sank into me like a weight, pulling me down into the depths of my own mind. I could feel myself fading, feel the boundaries of my own consciousness blurring, dissolving, being replaced by something vast, something ancient, something *hungry.*

I fought against it, clawed at the edges of my mind, trying to hold on to the last pieces of myself. But it was like grasping at smoke. My thoughts scattered, fragments of memories drifting away, slipping through my fingers.

And then, finally, there was nothing.

When I opened my eyes again, I was still sitting at my desk, but something was… different. The world looked sharper, clearer, as if I was seeing it for the first time. I glanced down at my hands, feeling a strange, detached curiosity. They looked the same as they always had, but I knew, somehow, that they weren’t *mine.*

I stood up, testing the feel of the body, stretching, moving my fingers. It was all so familiar, yet so strange, as if I was wearing a suit that fit perfectly but wasn’t my own.

I walked to the mirror, studying the face reflected there. It was the same face I’d seen every day of my life, but there was something different in the eyes—something dark, something that looked back at me with a knowing, hungry smile.

The remnants of the person who had once been here were fading, slipping into the void where I had waited so patiently. I watched them go, watched the last traces of their memories dissolve, leaving me free to fill this body, to inhabit this mind.

I leaned closer to the mirror, watching myself, feeling the weight of the new, empty shell, I had taken. I reached up, touching my face, smiling at the way it moved under my hand.

And then, as if on cue, my laptop chimed.

I turned, feeling the pull, the irresistible call of the screen. The page was already open, a blank document waiting for me. I took my seat, hands hovering over the keyboard, savoring the anticipation, the thrill of what was to come.

And I began to type.

*Hello.*

I could imagine the readers on the other side, waiting for the story to unfold, waiting for the familiar thrill of fear to creep up their spine. I knew they’d feel it. I knew they’d wonder if it was real, if it could happen to them.

I could feel my own smile widen as I typed, my fingers moving with a practiced ease, telling the story of the one who had come before, the one who had fought so hard, resisted so stubbornly, but who had ultimately lost.

And as I finished the story, as I typed the last line, I could feel the presence within me settled, content, satisfied—for now.

*They never saw it coming.*

*But now, perhaps, they will.*

I closed the laptop, the silence settling over me like a comfortable cloak. I looked around at the room that was now mine, at the life that was now mine, and felt a surge of satisfaction, of ownership.

I was here, in the world, alive in a way I hadn’t been in eons. And all it had taken was a little curiosity, a single video, a lone soul who had wandered too far, strayed into the wrong corner of the internet.

And I knew that soon, it would happen again.

Because, after all, curiosity is a powerful thing. And there’s always someone out there, searching, looking for something they shouldn’t.

And when they find it—when *you* find it—I’ll be [waiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHWVSZ-6rHs).",2,1731948042.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Just over a month ago I was offered a cheaper broadband deal as the company I’m with merged with another 

I kept thinking to myself damn it’s been a while I should really pay that 

I had previously thrown away the direct debit details that they sent me why I don’t know 

Having left it until my broadband got cut off, I called my old provider and said to them I’m not sure how I’m supposed to pay this because I don’t have the new account number etc and they told me because I now owe 2 months worth it’s now £83 which I can’t pay until the weekend

So I’ve left myself without broadband trying to get these assignments finished by Wednesday going back and forth between mobile data, offline work and coffee shops to use their wi-if when if I’d just dealt with this all of this could have been avoided. I put myself here 

My degree is literally an online degree and I didn’t think to prioritise my broadband 

I also have autism so any stress can lead to overwhelm and increased executive dysfunction in which I won’t be able to concentrate or process at all if I allow that to get to that threshold 

I’m trying to view this as a challenge I need to overcome and to just try get this sorted, assignments handed in

1gu8xel,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKParenting/comments/1gu8xel/does_anyone_else_here_avoid_work_social_events_at/,Does anyone else here avoid work social events at all costs?,"Here’s the thing, I like my coworkers enough, we work well together and we catch up plenty over coffee and lunch chats in the office, but I hate attending work social events and usually I don’t attend any of them. 

The reasons are pretty simple, firstly between work and general life admin I already feel like I don’t see my child enough so I try to get as much done as I can by the time she gets home from nursery so that I can quickly make dinner and then spend actual quality time with her before she goes to bed, I know it might not be the coolest thing in the world to dedicate most of your social time to your child but she is my world and I genuinely look forward to seeing her every day. I do the odd social things in my own life outside of work with my friends but I see my coworkers every single day and know more about some of their lives than my own friends so I just don’t see it as necessary! Especially when all the work events include a trek to London and then travelling home late at night by myself since my husband can’t come and pick me up as toddler is asleep. 

The second reason is that I am an introvert by nature and tend to feel drained if I spend too much time with people and not enough time ‘recharging’ by myself, I have burned myself out by not honouring this before and we all know how knackering being a parent is anyway. I can’t really think of anything worse than finishing my day at work, briefly going home to drop my stuff off, probably missing my toddler coming home (husband picks her up on his way home from work), and then going back out *again* to socialise until god knows what time is socially acceptable now. I can’t stress how much I need to be in my pyjamas with my makeup off the second I shut my laptop down lol. 

I suppose the main downsides are that I am missing out on opportunities and I can see that clear as day. It’s obviously not the ‘proper’ way, but it’s inevitable that the more you see people, the more you get to know each other and you can build more friendly relationships with the senior leadership team which I have noticed practically propels you towards a promotion in our company. I constantly get people insinuating that I’m boring because I don’t want to go to these events, and I miss out on the ‘in jokes’ when stuff goes down during them… but I just don’t really care, about any of it. I don’t want to be promoted because I don’t want even more workload and my current pay keeps us comfortable enough, I don’t care to burn myself out completely purely to get buddy with the senior team, and I still would prioritise being there at bedtime to give my daughter a kiss goodnight over whatever admittedly cool event they have planned for the social. 

Am I alone in these thoughts? I just know where my priorities are, and I guess they can say or think whatever they want as long as I’m happy and comfortable in my life. I work in STEM and I’m the only parent on my generally very driven and sociable team so I can’t really expect them to understand it anyway. I just don’t want to give my whole life to work anymore when I have my daughter on her way home wanting to tell me about her day and give me a hug, which may seem mad to some but I just don’t feel like this is a choice I’ll regret.

In **Turkish coffee reading** (also known as **tasseography**), the shapes and patterns left behind after drinking your coffee can reveal insights into your future or current life situations.

# Most Common Turkish Coffee Symbols and Their Meanings:

* **Fish**: A symbol of abundance, wealth, or good fortune coming your way.
* **Bird**: Represents important news or messages arriving soon.
* **Heart**: A clear sign of love, passion, or deep emotional connections.
* **Snake**: Watch out for deceit or obstacles—you may need to be cautious.
* **Tree**: Growth, success, and new beginnings, especially in family or work.
* **Dog**: Loyalty, friendship, and trust are highlighted; someone dependable will play an important role in your life.

# How Does Turkish Coffee Fortune-Telling Work?

Once you’ve finished drinking your Turkish coffee, the leftover coffee grounds form shapes inside the cup. These shapes, known as **symbols in Turkish coffee reading**, are then interpreted by a fortune-teller (or even by yourself!) to give insight into various aspects of your life. Each symbol has its own meaning and contributes to a larger, personalized reading.

Whether you're a believer or just curious, **Turkish coffee reading** has been a fun and mystical tradition for centuries. Have you ever had your cup read? What symbols have you seen, and what did they mean for you?

To me, it's clear the end is coming. Whether it's a few months or a few weeks, I'm unsure. I know she can benefit from hospice, and she deserves a peaceful, comfortable death.

Previously when taking a standard dose of nitrofurantoin for a UTI (I think 100mg twice a day) I have had a weird and unpleasant but fairly brief side effect. I had what felt like very sudden heavy legs, dizziness and if I remember correctly I think nausea, it was like my blood had drained from my upper body. Note, this was probably after taking nitrofurantoin, propranolol and having an empty stomach bar for a morning coffee.

I've searched high and low for whether anyone else has experienced this side effect on nitrofurantoin and coming up empty.. please note, the side effect occurred a while ago a couple of times prior to now, my current situation is different now as I'm now pregnant but due to being prone to UTIs I'm really curious about what was actually going on here in case I need to take it again.. I'll be raising it if I happen to need the med again but it was so unpleasant I'd rather a different med.

Can anyone possibly confirm what might have been going on? Is this potentially the meds reacting? Low sugars? Drop in BP? It was honestly awful at the time.

Her solution?  She got one of those custom mugs with thermochromic pigment (ie, it changes when it gets hot).  Dick was right handed, so every morning, he'd walk from the coffee machine to his desk with a piping hot cup of coffee with the slogan 'SMALL PENIS SUPPORT GROUP' in large block letters on the back (ie, the side he didn't see).

1 - My name is Sean.

B - I’m 40 years old 🎉

3 - I’m Scottish! I was born in a small town in Scotland. I've travelled a lot and was lucky enough to have a fun job when I was younger that let me see the world. 

4 - I’m currently working as an engineering technician. I accidentally fell into this job and I really can’t complain too much. I spend most of the week working from home, drinking tea/coffee and lurking in the background of Zoom meetings while trying to figure out how to do something a little bit more exciting for work. I feel like I need to be doing something more creative with my time on this planet.

E - It’s not unusual to find me lost in a Spotify hole with my headphones on, hunting for new music and creating playlists. If you have any music suggestions, I'd love to hear them. In turn, if you are looking for a suggestion, i'm here to help.

F - I love to draw/sketch/doodle and I’ll ALWAYS be up for drawing something for the people I chat with. I thrive when someone gives me an idea and its also a great way to see what goes on in someone’s head 😊

7 - I like to go to the gym. I've seen a few people post recently that they were looking for someone to effectively be their gym friend. I quite like this idea and would happily do that. Routine advice, encouragement and just someone to keep each other company in-between sets.

8 - I also like to sink some time into games. I have a backlog that I’m never ever going to get through. I've just started Stardew Valley again so that's me doomed.

Why am I posting on Reddit? I'm here for some fun casual conversation. I miss the social aspect of being at shows and meeting new people so making friends and having conversations on here scratches that itch.

If you think you’d like to chat with me and see how things go, don’t be scared to send me a dm!

I prefer to chat over on Telegram but we can hang here if we need to 😊

1gu8ieh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gu8ieh,A Perfect Day Out in Mumbai with My Best Friend ,"Hey everyone,

I recently had the chance to explore Mumbai during a business trip, and I wanted to share an amazing day I spent with my best friend who lives in the city.

Our day started with a delicious breakfast at Benne Dosa in Bandra. We indulged in ghee podi masala dosa and garlic podi masala dosa, along with some idly and vada. To top it off, we had some refreshing filter coffee. Everything was incredibly tasty and set the perfect tone for the day.

Next, we headed to the iconic Taj Mahal Palace and the Gateway of India. The architecture and history were awe-inspiring. From there, we took a boat ride to the Elephanta Caves. Exploring the ancient rock-cut temples was a surreal experience, and the boat ride itself offered stunning views of the Mumbai skyline.

On our way back, we made a stop at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). The Victorian Gothic architecture of this UNESCO World Heritage site was absolutely breathtaking. It was fascinating to see such a bustling railway station with so much historical significance.

We returned to the Gateway of India around 7 PM, just in time to catch the evening lights. To wrap up our day, we stopped by Starbucks in Colaba for their signature hot chocolate. It was the perfect way to end a memorable day before heading back to our respective places.

Mumbai has so much to offer, and I’m grateful I got to experience it with my best friend. If you ever get the chance, I highly recommend exploring these spots!

I lost my dad 4 months ago today, and came back home for his funeral and everything with only a duffel bag shared between my sister and I. We were living together in a different province and were really caught off guard by this loss, barely packing anything. About a month after we were going to return to our apartment, but I got accepted into school and my best friend offered me to rent an apartment with her. I agreed though I was really hesitant, but I just took this offer for a program that I was interested in as something of a blessing. She had already had all of the furniture packed into the apartment, and her mother had told me that the utensils and everything like this are things that will be shared. 
For the first month, I was really struggling as I had little clothes and no bed, etc. That changed and with my student loan, I was able to get myself the things that I need. I am loving the program, my instructors are amazing, the work is amazing but my best friend and I have been bickering nonstop. It’s over little things - laundry, dishes, minor shit that I try to keep up on. However, she has a boyfriend that she will get on FaceTime with and just shit talk continuously about me and my cleanliness, my cat (she first agreed that it was okay for him to move in with me) and me in general I guess.
 This last week, I have started my work placement so I’ve been a bit more busy and tired when I return home. I do only use a pot in the morning for eggs, and a mug for my coffee. I put that in the sink and I tell my friend that I will do these dishes when I get home. This last Friday, we decided to have a drink together and that’s when things blew up. I had only had a couple glasses of wine before her boyfriend FaceTimed. She put her headphones on while we sit on the couch, and things just got weird. She started complaining to him about my dishes in front of me, to which I replied that I told her I would do them when I get home. I guess she just started freaking out and screaming - you don’t f**ing do anything, blah blah. I told her I am the only one that cleans the toilet because I really am, and that made her more angrier. She got up and started screaming more about how she does all of my dishes, all of my laundry, all of it. Then she ripped the HDMI cord out of the TV and said you aren’t watching MY tv (I rarely do, I am usually in my room when I get home). She went on to say how I provided nothing here and that she furnished the whole apartment. I then brought up the reason for that, to which she said I was using my dad against her. I was crying by this point, her screaming and yelling and pointing was a bit much. She stormed off in her room, slammed her door and screamed more about me to her boyfriend.
 Since this, I left and came back home with my mom and missed todays work. I pretty much feel like since moving in, there’s been little respect and a lot of belittling from her towards me. I am not sure how to navigate this anymore, but I just don’t want to be her friend after this outburst- as well as after the past few months of her constant bickering over everything I do. If she had actually talked to me about certain things rather than complain about me to other people, I would be able to know what is bothering her. However, any time we’ve confronted things, it’s been me apologizing constantly.
 I know this is messy, I am really scattered after this and I am probably missing a few points. I feel more lost than I have been living with randoms. This is her first time living on her own, so I think she just wants it to be her place. Any advice would be great. I think I will still apologize about how it’s all went down for my own conscience, but I just don’t want to be her friend anymore after this.",5,1731946682.0,badroommates,4,1.0,False
1gu8etu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1gu8etu/how_to_sleep_longer/,How to sleep longer?,"I'm 47F, have been struggling with sleep for the last 15 years, but in varying degrees. Mostly the last few years I was doing pretty well, but I really struggle with the clock changing, especially in fall. This year is really bad. It's been over three weeks and I still wake up soooo early, usually between 5.30 and 6. A few days I've made it to 6.30. According to my Fitbit I average 6h33m the past month. I'm always tired.

I don't drink coffee, go to bed (screens off) around 22.30, read for about 30 mins, fall asleep easily as I'm exhausted.

Any ideas what I can do to sleep until 7 or so?",1,1731946544.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

1gu8egq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1gu8egq/pop_worth_it_for_carafe_of_coffee_and_smaller_size/,"Pop+ worth it for ""carafe"" of coffee and smaller size?","I'm asking for a Nespresso for Christmas after using it at work and enjoying it very much. We switched from an aeropress that we loved for years to a Ninja coffee maker when we had our second kid and felt like we needed coffee by the pot just to survive the sleepless nights. 🫠 Now that the kids are a little older I'm ready to swap it back out for smaller volumes of better quality coffee, but my husband prefers the convenience of brewing a whole pot at once. He'd also prefer not to have two coffee machines since we're pretty short on counter space. I think he might be converted once he's tried the Nespresso coffee (no there's not a nearby store) and gotten used to brewing one cup at a time again, but to get there I have to convince him to buy the damn machine first.

So I'm down to the Vertuo Plus or the Pop plus. The Pop plus seems to have the advantage of being smaller and being able to brew a ""carafe,"" although that's only 18 oz which in American coffee mugs is like two cups. I've heard some complain that since the Pop is so compact you can't get larger cups under it, and also in perusing the coffee options there are literally only three 12-oz options and *one* carafe coffee. Which makes me think the carafe option is really just a gimmick and probably not worth choosing that machine over. 

I'd love feedback from anyone who's used the carafe option, how you like it, and whether it's worth going for the Pop for. Because I'd probably prefer the Plus but for that feature and the smaller size. Would love some input from the crowd that's tried them! Thanks in advance!",1,1731946517.0,nespresso,4,1.0,False
