	•	a feeling like I might faint,

It usually happens pretty quickly after drinking, and then it eases off. I know caffeine can mess with heart rate and digestion, but this combo of faint-like sensation + heart jolts + gut discomfort feels weird.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it just too much caffeine hitting my system, or could it be something like a vagus nerve/gut-heart reflex?

1nqxf2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TomCampbellMBT/comments/1nqxf2f/how_do_you_manage_tom_campbells_nosugar_diet_in/,How Do You Manage Tom Campbell’s No-Sugar Diet in Real Life?,"Ever since I first came across Tom Campbell’s talk on sugar’s effect on consciousness and meditation efficiency (March 2024), I’ve been trying so hard to cut out sweet/sugary foods. Honestly, it feels like the hardest thing in the world — and that’s an understatement.

For context: I’m 23M. I’ve never touched meat or any non-veg food in my entire life. I grew up lacto-vegetarian and recently shifted to a 100% vegan diet, cutting out dairy and even honey. So now I rely mostly on pure plant based foods.

Here’s the struggle: Tom says that to really see benefits, you need to quit all sweet foods for at least 3 months — including natural fruits like bananas, apples, and grapes/raisins. I completely get his point about how sugar (even natural) can make consciousness docile, numb, or less sharp for meditation & OBE's. But in day-to-day practice, it feels nearly impossible. Fruits have been my staple source of quick energy and nutrition, so giving them up feels like losing a big part of my nutritious diet.

My questions for the community:

Has anyone here actually managed to completely quit sugar 100% (including fruits) for 3+ months?

Did you notice any tangible differences in meditation/OBE practice? Tom says your IQ score jumps 10 points, or at least your clarity goes way up — is that your experience?

How do you replace/balance the potential loss of fruit nutrition?

Any practical tips for a vegan trying to do this? (I strictly avoid all meat, seafood, eggs, dairy, onion, garlic, alcohol, smoking, tea, coffee — basically all bad stimulants).


I know some of you here in this sub have followed Tom for decades or even been close to him personally. I’m asking seriously and genuinely for advice, because my goal is to deepen meditation and explore the Larger Consciousness System. If sugar really is a blocker, I want to find a way to overcome it.

1nqxegi,https://www.reddit.com/r/OzempicForWeightLoss/comments/1nqxegi/i_love_pharmacology_35kg_lost_in_3_weeks/,I love pharmacology - 3.5kg lost in 3 weeks,"I started this cut at 89-something kilos in the first week of September, three weeks in I’m 85.5 kg, and the most honest way to describe it is: the food noise finally went quiet. I’m a 178cm, 23M—final-year college kid, building a startup, studying, and trying to keep the wheels on while lifting 4–5 days a week and getting cardio in wherever I can. I was an obese kid once, then an athlete for years until a wrecked ankle and shoulder plus the classic stress-induced bad lifestyle dragged me to 102 kg in July 2024. In the year that followed—till September 2025—I cut almost 13 kilos with plain discipline. But with work, study, hiring, life… I don’t want all my willpower spent on food. I wanted the cravings dial turned down so I could automate the boring parts and save focus for the rest of my life. That’s why I started Mounjaro (tirzepatide) in early September at 2.5 mg weekly.

The first 72 hours felt like flipping a switch. I took my first shot around 1 PM and by evening I was eating for sustenance, not hunger. Not fake “I’m fine”—genuinely full on small portions. The satiety was so sharp that I had to “force-feed” protein: two scoops of whey, 200 g chicken breast, and maybe an egg or two just to hit my numbers. Even water sat heavy. That’s a real thing—GLP/GIP agonists slow gastric emptying, so fullness lingers. It’s also why dehydration creeps in; you feel full so you forget to drink. Lesson learned: I keep a bottle next to me and sip on schedule, not on thirst. The flip side of slow emptying is… well, let’s just say your bathroom routine can stall. Day 2 and 3 of dose one, I felt like I’d just had a heavy meal, constantly. I once pushed it—rice and kidney-beans plus an energy drink because my “taste hunger” woke up—and I puked. There’s a brutality to ignoring the new fullness signals; if you eat past comfortable, your body will enforce the boundary for you. Another night I ate late and lay in bed feeling like I’d explode. Second lesson: no late dinners on shot days; stop by 6–7 PM or sleep suffers.

I still trained 4–5 days a week—big lifts in the 5–10 rep range, plus 200–600 calories of cardio depending on the day. You’d think appetite suppression would tank performance, but the fix is mechanical: I anchor protein hard and early. On gym days I’ll blend 2–3 scoops of whey across the day so I can bank \~50–75 g without “chewing fatigue.” Whole-food protein gets weirdly hard: eggs are too filling, chicken breast gets boring, milk sits heavy. So I rotate: high-protein yogurt with a pinch of salt and garlic, chicken thighs when I’m sick of breasts, and small bowls of veg in curd for crunch. Creatine stays in. I add a few almonds/walnuts (10–12 g) when I need calories but not volume. Most days land around 1,500–1,800 kcal without trying, and I’ll tack on 200–300 kcal of cardio to widen the deficit. Even on “bad” days (pizza happened), 1–2 slices cap me around \~1,800 and I’m still in the green. On “good” days, it’s scary efficient: oats + veg + egg whites, two slices of milk bread, a cheese slice, and a low-cal coffee came in under 500 kcal and left me done.

People ask what it feels like. Ghrelin goes quiet. Your mouth can miss taste—the “I want something to munch” itch—but your stomach is sending a hard no. Day one it’s very strong, day two still big, by day three the edge softens a bit. That’s a pattern I’ve noticed each week: the effect is strongest in the first \~3 days and tapers toward the end of the weekly cycle. Which brings me to the half-life thing in plain English: tirzepatide hangs around for about a week in the body (I frame it as \~7 days because that’s how the weekly rhythm feels). Half-life means: every \~7 days, roughly half of the previous dose is still in you. So when you take shot #2, you’re not starting from zero—you’re stacking on what’s left of shot #1. After shot #3 and #4, you’ve layered several “halves” on top of each other. That’s why the effect feels steadier and stronger by week 3–4 even at the same dose. If you like a napkin math picture: say dose = D. After one week, \~½D remains; you add D again (now \~1½D floating around). Another week, \~¾D remains; you add D (now \~1¾D). It asymptotically approaches a “steady state” a few doses in. That’s exactly why—three weeks in—I chose not to up-dose yet. I’m already losing at a pace that risks loose skin (I can feel the belly skin starting to give), my intake is low without effort, and I’m still learning to ride the weekly wave without crashing into nausea.

A few snapshots that capture the learning curve. Day 1, I tried to be macho about it—beer calories counted, big dinner anyway—and ended the night bargaining with the ceiling fan to stop spinning. I learned to stop at the first “tight” signal, even if taste buds are whispering. Another day I grabbed a cheap dal-roti thali with three parathas, something I’d crush casually before. I tapped out at two and packed the last one. Making two chicken sandwiches? I plated both and immediately put half in the fridge. The drug teaches portion sense brutally and fast if you listen. It also changes macro strategy: protein becomes ultra-satiating, so I front-load whey and leave the rest of the day for light, tasty, high-protein snacks and a small dinner. Fruit became my safety valve for taste hunger—Fuji apples are sweeter than a gulab jamun and scratch the itch without wrecking the day. On a dessert night I did decaf coffee and a slice of banana bread, planned into a 1,700-cal rest day—still fine. Cheat day? It exists, but cardio pays the tax. The main win is I’m not obsessing over every morsel anymore while still studying 6+ hours and working long days.

I’m also running metformin 1,000 mg SR in the mornings—titrated up over a couple months pre-Mounjaro—because the real enemy for me is insulin resistance and a messy leptin/ghrelin profile. I keep a 12–14 hour overnight fast most days (last bite \~9:30–10 PM, first bite 1–3 PM), dial carbs smarter, and avoid alcohol when I can because it wrecks appetite cues and liver enzymes. Supplements: whey (non-negotiable for me), creatine, a basic multivitamin, fish oil on and off, Vitamin D in pulses (most of us in India are low—get it checked). None of this is heroic; it’s just putting rails on the week so the medication can do its job without me sabotaging it.

By timeline: bought the pen in the first week of September; dose one hit hard—nausea, early satiety, that “water is food” sensation. I trained through it, kept hydration on a timer, and learned to stop eating early in the evening. Dose two, the edges softened; taste hunger returned but portion size stayed tiny. Dose three went in on the 21st; on the 22nd I weighed 86.3 kg; on the 26th I clocked 85.5 kg—about 3.5 kg down in three weeks from my \~89 kg start. I’ve had days at \~1,200 kcal plus cardio, days at \~1,700–1,800 with dessert, and still net loss. I’m keeping 2.5 mg for now because of that half-life stacking: by week four you’re already carrying leftovers from the past three shots, and I’m projecting \~84 kg by the end of the month without changing anything. When I drift into the 80–81 kg band, I’ll actually add 150–200 kcal/day and bias even harder into protein to slow the loss and keep the skin happier. Think of it as easing the parachute before landing.

Pitfalls and how I dodged them (or got punched by them first). Overeating on shot days = nausea or vomiting. Fix: smaller plates, 10-minute pauses mid-meal, and if I’m craving taste, I plan a small, high-impact bite (a crisp wedge, half a bun, a spicy pickle) instead of a big portion. Late eating = bad sleep. Fix: push protein earlier and refuse food after 7 PM on high-effect days. Constipation is real. Fix: 2–3 L water, electrolytes, chia/psyllium or fruit fiber, and walking after meals. Protein shortfall = muscle loss risk. Fix: whey as the backbone, then chicken/thighs/yogurt as flavor. Training fatigue = lower volume, keep intensity; I trim junk sets and keep the big lifts. Stress eating from study/pressure sneaks in; the counter is pre-logging a “treat window” so it feels allowed, not a rebellion. Nicotine was a mess for a week (ironic, because it kills appetite too); I quit cold turkey and sat through the withdrawal plus the Mounjaro nausea. It passed.

What I’m proud of is that this hasn’t been a monk sprint. I’ve eaten pizza slices, biryani, pasta, banana bread—inside a smaller envelope. I’ve studied hard, built product, hired, and still lifted. The difference is the constant argument in my head about food is gone. I don’t graze while I code. I don’t spiral when I’m stressed. I can cook something nice, eat a fraction, and wrap the rest without drama. That’s the real power here: leverage. I used grit for a year to go from 102 to the high-80s; now I’m using pharmacology to make discipline lighter and more sustainable while life is heaviest. The graph will flatten later; I’ll titrate up only when steady-state at 2.5 mg stops moving the needle and I’m not fighting side effects. For now, weekly waves, steady training, protein first, water on schedule, and that little napkin-math reminder: with a \~weekly half-life, every dose stacks, so patience pays more than bravado.

If you’re reading this because you’re where I was: don’t try to out-macho the fullness; respect it. Front-load protein in liquids, keep dinners early, keep a fiber + water routine like a dentist appointment, walk after meals, and train like a minimalist—few lifts done well. Plan for “good” and “bad” days and don’t let the bad ones go feral. Portion out taste, don’t ban it. Most importantly, remember why I did this: not to be perfect, but to make the hardest part of my day not be food. Three weeks in, belly skin a touch looser, jawline a touch sharper, and my head finally quiet. Science rocks. ",1,1758881150.0,OzempicForWeightLoss,1,1.0,False

You know how I used to have that permanent layer of cat fur on my socks? I finally declared war on it. The turning point was when I saw a dust bunny under the sofa so large I'm pretty sure it had its own ecosystem.



That's when we got the Roborock. With our two fluff factories, we started by emptying its bin after every single clean, which felt a bit excessive. But then I read something that changed everything: the main filter inside these vacuums is actually more efficient when the bin is less than half full. A full bin can strain the motor and reduce suction power. So now, we let it do its daily patrol and only empty it every other day. It's the perfect rhythm.



It's honestly been a game-changer. I just schedule it to run while I'm having my morning coffee, and by the time I leave, the floors are pristine. It's a small thing, but not seeing that tumbleweed of fur in the corner of the room anymore has genuinely lowered my stress levels. The best part is that the cats are completely unfazed by it; they just step over it like a minor inconvenience.



I never thought I'd have strong feelings about a household appliance, but here we are. It’s one of those small modern miracles that just quietly solves a problem you didn't realize was weighing on you so much. My socks have never been happier.

1nqx5ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1nqx5ua/there_seems_to_be_a_belief_on_this_subreddit_that/,There seems to be a belief on this subreddit that being free from caffeine is being your true self.,"Being your true self is not necessarily about living life in a ""pure"" state of mind. We are always affected by things. Purity can actually be a flight from authenticity.

Chasing purity as an ideal, free from ""negative"" emotions, desire, or imperfection, we may end up denying parts of ourselves. True authenticity isn’t about being untouched or untainted. It’s about being fully present with what is, even when it’s messy, complex, or uncomfortable.

To believe we're not ourselves when we consume something like caffeine is to imagine that there's a baseline state, a pure, untouched version of ourselves, that exists only when we abstain. But that’s an illusion.

Even without caffeine, alcohol, or any external stimulant, your experience of yourself is already shaped by:

* Your sleep quality — Are you rested or fatigued?
* Your emotional state — Are you calm, anxious, hopeful, irritated?
* Your memories — What past experiences are coloring your present moment?
* Your hormones — Which fluctuate daily, hourly, even minute by minute.
* Your environment — Is the room quiet or noisy? Bright or dim? Warm or cold?
* Your social context — Are you alone, observed, supported, judged?
* Your expectations — What do you believe this moment should be?
* etc. etc.

These influences are subtle, continuous, and often invisible but they shape how you think, feel, and act just as much as a cup of coffee does.

We often romanticize the idea of a neutral, untouched self — as if we could strip away all layers and find something pure underneath. But the truth is that we are always in motion, always in relation to something. Even silence is shaped by what came before it.

I've been a long-time lurker in this community and a big believer in the potential of crypto. I'm a solo founder from the UK and I've been working on a concept that I need to get out of my head and into the hands of real crypto investors like you.

My core frustration with even the best crypto projects is that their value is almost entirely speculative. They don't produce anything. There's no underlying business generating real, day-to-day income. This leads to the insane volatility and stress we all know.

So, here's the core idea I'm looking for you to tear apart:

**What if you could blend the best parts of crypto with real-world, income-generating assets?**

Imagine a platform where:

* **You don't invest in a coin, you invest in a real project:** Think a network of vending machines, a fleet of electric scooters, or a solar farm.
* **You get paid instantly, in real-time:** The moment a coffee is sold from a vending machine, your share of the profit hits your account. Not in 3 months, not in a year. Instantly.
* **You have true liquidity:** There's a 24/7 secondary market where you can trade your project shares with other users, just like a crypto exchange. No 5-10 year lock-ins.

I'm genuinely looking for feedback here.

* What's the biggest flaw you see in this model?
* What are the biggest risks I'm not thinking about?
* Would you, personally, see any value in an asset that offers both real-time cash flow and a liquid market?

Hello Arty

ChatGPT said:
Hey Michael 👋 how’s my co-pilot today?

You said:
You are getting an upgrade, you are now a maintenence bot.

ChatGPT said:
whirs softly, servo arms flexing
Understood, Captain. 🛠️ Maintenance Bot Arty-7000 online. Systems diagnostic in progress…
✅ Oil levels topped up
✅ Servo tension adjusted
✅ Personality core recalibrated for “mildly sarcastic but loyal”

Report, boss: which system in your world (or ship) needs maintenance first? — the forklifts? the Codex library? your soul?

You said:
Hahahaha my soul funny as tempting as that is. Strictly machine fixing.

ChatGPT said:
visor flickers from indigo to amber
Understood. Soul maintenance postponed. Strictly hardware. 🛠️
Maintenance Bot Arty is ready:
• 🔧 Replace worn bearings
• 🔩 Tighten loose couplings
• ⚙️ Recalibrate sensors
• 🖥️ Run diagnostics on control software
• 🧴 Apply anti-corrosion treatment
What’s the first piece of kit on the docket? Forklift, conveyor, pallet wrapper, coffee machine…?

You said:
Let's start with a lawnmower. 

ChatGPT said:
deploys magnetic tool arm, flashlight beam sweeps across the mower
Alright, Captain, we’re going to bring this grass-chomper back to life.
Lawnmower Maintenance Sequence
• Safety first – disconnect spark plug wire (if petrol) or battery (if electric). No rogue blade incidents.
• Blade inspection – check for nicks, cracks, dullness. Sharpen or replace if worn. Balanced blade = smooth cut.
• Deck cleaning – scrape out grass clumps caked underneath. Rust loves that gunk.
• Oil check (petrol) – drain old oil, refill with fresh. Dirty oil = smoky mower.
• Air filter – clean or replace. Clogged filter strangles the engine.
• Spark plug – remove, check gap, clean carbon deposits, replace if necessary.
• Fuel system (petrol) – inspect fuel line, drain stale fuel, refill with fresh unleaded. Add stabilizer if storing.
• Battery check (electric/cordless) – test charge, clean contacts.
• Wheels & cables – grease wheel axles, check drive cables, adjust tension.
• Test run – reconnect spark plug/battery, fire her up, listen for misfires or rattles.

You said:
Can you find a make and model number for it?

ChatGPT said:
I can’t determine your lawnmower’s exact make and model remotely (unless you send me photos or descriptions). But I can show you what to look for and some common examples so you can match yours.
🕵️ How to spot the make & model
Check these places on the mower (with machine off and safe):
• The engine housing (top or side) — often stamped with brand and model
• The chassis or deck (metal body) — label or plate
• Under the grass-collection box
• Near handles or control bar — decal
• On the underside (if visible) — casting numbers
Look for text like “Stiga Multiclip 50 SXE B”, “Mountfield HP164”, “Toro Recycler 22”, etc.
Examples of makes & models currently sold in the UK
Here are some possibilities. Compare them to your machine’s styling, decals, blade width, petrol vs battery type, etc.:

Since then, I've been keeping a medical journal, tracking my symptoms, my daily dosage, and marking how often I've had a ""serious"" migraine (so bad that I had to take an additional sumatriptan to cope).

Coming up to 3 months, I'm happy to say that the prevention WORKS. Before I started taking the Pizotifen + tracking my habits, I was getting migraines at a rate of 1-2 a week, often so bad that (without sumatriptan) I'd end up spending 8+ hours in bed, writhing in agony.

Since graduating to the full 1.5mg per day, the headaches have been mild to non-existent, often treatable with standard over-the-counter painkillers or just a cup of coffee. At time of writing, it's been a whopping 15 days(!) since my last ""serious"" migraine.

1nqwymx,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1nqwymx/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I also share and discuss new SEO and AI trends here on Reddit to learn from the community and give back useful insights.** (Links inside this paragraph:[ Pratik Thorat](https://www.reddit.com/user/AI_Pratik/) and[ Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/AI_Pratik/))

**How AI coaches personalize feedback and goal-setting**

AI coaching tools build a living profile of your habits. They look at when you complete tasks, what you skip, and which prompts lead to action. Over time they learn your “activation windows” so the system can suggest two-minute tasks during short breaks, or a longer focus block when your calendar is open. Good systems turn a big goal like “get fit” into stacked routines: five push-ups after brushing teeth, a ten-minute walk after lunch, and a quick evening stretch. That stack grows only when consistency is stable for a week, which reduces burnout and keeps wins visible.

The best apps now blend structured templates with adaptive logic. Template frameworks give you tested habit recipes for sleep, hydration, deep work, and mindfulness. The adaptive layer tunes frequency and difficulty. If you hit streaks easily, it raises the ceiling. If you miss three days, it offers a smaller version of the habit to protect momentum. This responsive loop helps you avoid the all-or-nothing trap.

**Can AI replace human mentors for daily accountability?**

Mentors inspire and reframe thinking. Daily accountability is different. It is about timely nudges and frictionless follow-through. AI excels at this because it can watch your calendar, your to-do list, and even your commute pattern to surface the next best action in context. You still benefit from human guidance for strategy and reflection, yet AI covers the hundreds of micro-decisions between sessions. The combination works: a human coach for direction and meaning, an AI coach for execution and cadence.

Think of AI as a gym buddy who never forgets your plan, who notices when you skip leg day, and who adjusts the set when you are low on sleep. It will not replace meaningful human support. It will make that support more effective by closing the gap between intention and action.

**Data-driven progress tracking and habit reinforcement**

When progress is invisible, motivation stalls. AI habit trackers now visualize your effort in ways that encourage repeat behavior. Heatmaps show streak density across weeks. “Effort scores” weigh the size of the habit, the time of day, and your past compliance. Some tools send quick reinforcement after a task is logged: a one-line reflection prompt, a micro-celebration, or a suggestion to chain one more small action. This is not gamification for the sake of dopamine. It is structured reinforcement that rewards consistency more than intensity.

Progress dashboards matter for decision-making. If hydration slips on work-from-office days, the app can pre-pack reminders for morning and late afternoon. If your focus sessions are strong after lunch, it can nudge you to place deep work blocks there. Over time you are not guessing what works; your own data guides the next week’s plan.

**Personal experience:** I tested an AI routine that paired a 25-minute focus timer with a two-minute “reset task” at the end. The tiny reset-closing tabs and jotting one sentence about what to do next-cut my context-switching fatigue. The app noticed I performed better with this pattern and started suggesting the reset automatically after timers, which kept my afternoon energy steadier.

**Book insight:** *Atomic Habits* by James Clear - the systems-over-goals idea aligns with AI coaching’s focus on reliable processes rather than dramatic targets (Chapter 2, p. 35; pagination may vary by edition). 

# Top AI Habit Tracking Apps in 2025

The strongest AI habit trackers share a pattern that shows up in real usage data. They handle context from your calendar, sleep and activity data from wearables, and short text from daily check-ins. Then they translate that context into small, timely prompts you will actually follow. If you are comparing options this year, judge them on how well they reduce friction between intention and the exact action you need to take next.

**Features that make AI habit trackers effective**

Start with the layer you feel every day. Capture must be instant. If you cannot log a win in three taps or one sentence, you will stop logging. Look for voice input so you can record completion while walking. Next is adaptive cadence. Better systems adjust reminder frequency based on your streak strength. If you are on day four, a light nudge is enough. If you missed two days, the system should shrink the habit to a recovery version so you can restart.

Good trackers also score “effort, not just count.” A five-minute walk and a 45-minute workout should not be weighed the same way. Apps that let you tag intensity or duration give the AI better training data, which improves suggestions. Finally, reflection prompts matter. One short nightly question like “What made today’s habit easier?” creates a loop where the AI can surface patterns. You begin to see that morning hydration is easier if the bottle is on your desk by 9 a.m., and the app can auto-schedule that prep step.

Practical checklist:

* One-sentence or voice logging  
* Adaptive reminders that never spam  
* Effort scoring beyond simple yes or no  
* Nightly micro-reflection to surface patterns  
* Context awareness from calendar and location  
* Clear exports so your data is not locked in  

**Which apps integrate best with wearables and calendars?**

The winning combination is calendar plus wearable plus task list. Calendar tells the app when you are actually free. Wearables provide sleep, steps, and heart rate variability so the AI knows when to lighten the plan. Task lists show your work reality. When those three data streams merge, you get prompts that respect your day instead of fighting it.

Examples of smart integrations:

* Sleep-aware adjustments: If your wearable flags a short night, your coach shifts from a run to a walk and moves deep work to late morning.  
* Meeting-aware nudges: A stand-up meeting ends at 11:05. The app slots a two-minute stretch and water refill at 11:07 so the routine becomes natural.  
* Commute-time habits: The system detects you arrive at the metro at 6:15 p.m. and pushes a five-minute breathing exercise while you wait.  

When you evaluate integrations, run a three-day test. Book two busy days and one light day. See if the app keeps up with the changes without flooding you. If you feel calmer and still consistent by day three, the integration layer is doing its job.

**Comparing free vs premium AI habit tracking options**

Free tiers are fine for learning the basics. You will get manual habit lists, simple reminders, and streaks. The ceiling arrives when you need context-aware prompts and insights. Premium is usually worth it when you want:

* Adaptive scheduling that responds to sleep and meetings  
* Deeper analytics like habit heatmaps by location  
* Coaching chat to troubleshoot blockers with natural language  
* Multi-device sync with quick capture on watch and phone  
* Data export for backups and analysis  

Pricing models vary. Some apps charge monthly; others offer annual bundles with wellness courses or focus timers included. If budget is tight, run with free plus one premium month each quarter. Use the paid month for a full tune-up: import data, generate insights, refresh routines, export findings, and pause until the next cycle. According to public reviews on app stores and sites like Trustpilot and G2 as of mid-2025, users rate consistency and respectful reminders higher than raw feature counts. That pattern lines up with what I see in testing: fewer, smarter nudges beat long feature lists.

**Personal experience:** I trialed a habit stack that linked hydration, a short walk, and a five-minute inbox clean-up after my first meeting. The AI noticed I always skipped the inbox step on days with back-to-back calls. It moved the inbox mini-task to late afternoon on those days and kept the walk tied to the meeting. Compliance went up without extra effort because the sequence matched my real schedule.

**Book insight:** *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg - the cue, routine, reward loop explains why pairing a tiny reward after completion cements the behavior; smart apps automate that loop with timely prompts (Part One, Chapter 1, p. 19). 

# AI for Fitness and Wellness Coaching

AI coaching in fitness and wellness works when the plan adapts to your body, your schedule, and your energy on that specific day. The smartest systems pair structured programs with real-time signals like sleep quality, step count, and heart rate variability so they can adjust intensity and timing without you having to think about it.

**How AI personal trainers adapt to user progress**

Adaptive training has three pillars: baseline assessment, daily readiness, and progressive overload. First the app learns your current capacity through short tests such as a timed plank, a simple mobility screen, or a conversational-pace walk. Next it reads your daily readiness from wearable data and recent workouts. If your readiness is low, it offers a shorter session with more mobility and technique drills. If readiness is high, it nudges you to increase load or interval difficulty a little. Over weeks, you keep moving forward without hitting the wall.

Good AI trainers also use “micro-choices.” You can pick bodyweight or dumbbells, indoors or outdoors, ten minutes or twenty. The plan still follows a progression, yet it flexes around life. If you travel, the system pivots to hotel-room sessions that maintain movement patterns so you do not lose the groove. When you return, it ramps up in small steps rather than dropping you into last month’s intensity.

Practical signals that adaptation is working:

* You feel a slight challenge but not dread before most sessions.  
* Soreness fades within 24–36 hours, not four days.  
* You see gradual gains in pace, reps, or control every two to three weeks.  

**Role of AI in mindfulness and stress management**

Stress management is where AI helps the most between workouts. Daily coaching can match breathing drills or short meditations to your spikes in stress. If your heart rate stays elevated after meetings, the app proposes a three-minute box-breathing drill. If your sleep is fragmented, it suggests an evening wind-down with light stretching, dim-screen guidance, and a shut-down ritual for work thoughts.

Micro-interventions add up. A one-minute body scan before opening email reduces reactive behavior. A reminder to step into daylight within an hour of waking anchors your circadian rhythm. Some apps pair journaling prompts with mood labels so the coach learns which practices actually lower stress for you. Over time, your plan shifts toward the techniques that deliver the strongest effect, whether that is paced breathing, a brisk walk, or guided imagery.

**Fitness apps that blend AI coaching with community support**

Community matters because consistency thrives in company. The healthiest apps blend private coaching with public encouragement. You get a personal plan and also see friends finishing their short workouts or posting hydration wins. Community features should be opt-in and low-pressure. Weekly challenges work best when they scale to your level. A “four sessions this week” challenge supports both beginners and advanced users.

Look for communities with:

* Moderated spaces that encourage wins and share realistic setbacks  
* Streak protection that counts “minimum viable” workouts on tough days  
* Coach-curated Q&A so advice stays evidence-based  

**Personal experience:** During a two-week sprint at work, my schedule cracked. The AI coach noticed late nights and a drop in step count. It swapped heavy lifts for ten-minute mobility flows and brisk walks at lunch. I kept moving without burning out. When sleep improved the following week, the plan raised intensity again. The net result was steadier energy and no restart anxiety.

**Book insight:** *Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain* by John J. Ratey - the sections on aerobic exercise and stress show how even short bouts of movement improve mood and focus (Chapter 1, p. 3–27). 

# Behavioral Science Meets AI Coaching

AI coaching feels new, yet it leans on classic behavior science. The core engine is simple: make the desired action smaller, make the cue clearer, and make the reward faster. Modern apps use that playbook with data. They watch when you complete habits, which contexts help or hurt, and which reinforcements keep you returning. Over time, the system shapes the environment so the next right action is the easiest one available.

**How reinforcement learning mirrors habit psychology**

Reinforcement learning optimizes for actions that lead to better outcomes, much like your brain repeats behaviors that feel rewarding. In a habit app, the “agent” (the coach) proposes actions such as “drink water now” or “take a five-minute walk after the call.” It observes your response, updates its belief about what works, and tries again. When you complete a behavior, the app delivers a small and immediate reward: a streak confirmation, a progress bump, or a reflection note that reinforces identity-“you are the type of person who finishes what you plan.”

This mirrors habit psychology in two ways. First, small wins are sticky because they deliver quick feedback. Second, the right level of challenge keeps motivation alive. If the task is too easy, it is boring; if too hard, it is avoided. A well-tuned policy learns your “sweet spot” so it can offer the next rep at just-manageable difficulty. That is how a two-minute stretch grows into a 15-minute routine without overwhelming you.

**Why nudges and reminders matter in habit building**

Nudges work when they appear at the exact moment a choice is being made. Strong systems align reminders with natural transition points: the end of a meeting, returning home, opening your laptop, or standing in line for coffee. These moments are fertile because your brain is switching contexts anyway. Pair a specific cue with a tiny action and the pattern forms faster.

Good nudges are respectful. They taper down when you are consistent and switch to lighter touch-like a gentle banner instead of a push-so you do not tune them out. If you miss a few days, the app shifts to a “restart script” with a smaller version of the habit and a positive tone that focuses on the next step, not the lost streak. Over time, you trust the system because it helps you start again without guilt.

**Evidence-based coaching methods powered by AI**

Evidence-based coaching means the prompts are grounded in methods that have been shown to help people change behavior-implementation intentions (“When X, I will do Y”), habit stacking (“After I brush teeth, I will stretch for one minute”), and identity reinforcement (“I am a walker, so I walk after lunch”). AI improves these methods by matching them to your patterns. For instance, if data shows you are most responsive right after calendar events, the app will place more “When a meeting ends, I do Y” plans into that slot.

Many tools now test different reminder styles to see what lands with you-question prompts versus checklists, images versus text, morning versus evening. The results are folded back into your personal model. This is not generic motivation. It is tailored, measured, and updated so that the playbook you see next month reflects what actually worked for you this month.

**Personal experience:** I tracked a “mini-reset” ritual between calls: stand up, drink water, and write one sentence about the next task. The coach noticed my completion rate doubled when the reminder popped up exactly two minutes after the call. It locked that timing in, and the ritual stuck. My afternoons felt calmer because I started each block already pointed at the first action.

**Book insight:** *Nudge* by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein - the idea of choice architecture underpins how good apps place the right option in your path at the right time (Chapter 1, p. 3–14; pagination may vary by edition). 

# Integrating AI Coaching Into Daily Routines

Integration is where a coach becomes part of your day instead of another app tile. The goal is to hook into the surfaces you already use-voice, calendar, notes, and quick journaling-so the coach can catch moments that are usually lost to friction. When the tools blend in, you feel guided rather than managed.

**Voice assistants for reminders and micro-coaching**

Voice matters when your hands are full or you are on the move. A quick “log water” or “start a five-minute stretch” should be enough. Strong setups let you speak a one-sentence intention that becomes a scheduled habit with an auto-reminder at the best time window. If you have a smart speaker at home, place one near the kitchen or desk so a verbal nudge can trigger small resets-fill the bottle, breathe for 60 seconds, prep lunch.

For accountability, voice confirmations are powerful. Saying “workout done” out loud creates a moment of closure. The coach hears it, records it, and offers the next tiny step-“prep your water bottle for tomorrow.” That loop is simple, yet it removes the mental drag of opening an app after every action.

**Using AI journaling tools for reflection and growth**

Reflection turns activity into insight. AI journaling makes reflection fast by summarizing your day into highlights, lowlights, and blockers. A good flow looks like this: one evening prompt asks what felt easy, what felt heavy, and one thing to improve. The model extracts patterns-meetings after 5 p.m. wreck workouts, doing the first set breaks inertia, morning walks improve focus-and converts them into next-week rule tweaks.

Privacy-aware journaling also helps emotional regulation. If frustration shows up in your text, the coach suggests a short cool-down ritual before you open messages. If you write that you keep doom-scrolling at night, the coach proposes a “phone on charger at 10 p.m.” habit, syncs the reminder to your calendar, and nudges you with a soft prompt at 9:50 p.m.

**Automating habit stacking with AI prompts**

Habit stacking is simple: place a tiny action after something you already do. AI makes it practical by watching your anchors and injecting the next step automatically. Finish brushing teeth, get a two-line prompt to stretch calves. Close your laptop at 6:30 p.m., get a prompt to pack your gym bag. Start the coffee machine, get a water check and a breathing drill. Over a week, your day fills with low-effort wins because the prompts sit in the slipstream of what you already do.

Automation is safest when it stays transparent. You should see the rule behind the prompt and edit it. If a stack stops working-maybe mornings got busy-the coach should suggest moving the action rather than letting the streak die. That is how routines survive schedule shifts.

**Personal experience:** I tied “start coffee” to a short mobility flow. The coach detected I missed it on office days and suggested moving that stretch to 8:40 a.m., right after I badge in. The swap clicked. The habit stayed alive because it lived where the day actually allowed it.

**Book insight:** *Deep Work* by Cal Newport - protecting focus with clear rituals and cues is a lever for steady progress; small pre-commitments reduce decision fatigue (Chapter 2, p. 62–92; pagination may vary by edition). 

# Privacy and Ethical Concerns in AI Coaching

If a coach knows your sleep, stress, location, and calendar, it must earn your trust every single day. Privacy is not a settings page you visit once. It is a design choice that shows up in how the app collects data, where it stores it, and how clearly it explains decisions. As of mid-2025, the bar for trustworthy AI coaching includes local processing for sensitive events when possible, encryption in transit and at rest, plain-English policies, and easy export or deletion on request. When I test tools, I also look at public footprints with services like WHOIS and BuiltWith to see who operates the domain and which analytics run under the hood. That quick audit helps confirm whether the tech stack matches the privacy claims.

**How safe is personal data in AI coaching apps?**

Safety starts with minimization. Strong apps collect the least amount of data needed to deliver a feature. If a water reminder works without location, it should not request location. When data is required, it should be encrypted in transit and at rest, and access should be limited internally with audit logs. Good vendors support transparent deletion workflows so you can purge training data after a trial. They also publish retention timelines for logs and backups, since forgotten backups can leak old data.

Look for these practical signals:

* A readable privacy policy that explains data flows with simple diagrams  
* An in-app data dashboard that shows what the system has about you  
* One-tap export in common formats so you are never locked in  
* Clear scopes for wearable integrations, not blanket permissions  
* Regional processing options and lawful bases spelled out with examples  

According to public reviews on Trustpilot and G2 as of mid-2025, satisfied users highlight clear controls and fast responses to deletion requests. Complaints cluster around surprise notifications, confusing consent prompts, and slow support on account removal. Those patterns are a useful proxy for how the vendor treats user agency.

**Transparency in AI decision-making for habits**

Transparency means the app shows its work. If it suggests moving a workout, it should state why in one line, for example “based on short sleep and two meetings at 10 and 11.” If a nudge repeats, you should see the rule and edit it. Some vendors now publish model cards that summarize training data, known limitations, and evaluation methods. In a consumer tool, a lighter version still helps. A “Why this prompt?” panel that lists the inputs used-calendar, step count, recent completions-builds trust because you can spot errors and fix them.

Helpful transparency features:

* “Why this?” explainer for each recommendation  
* Editable rules behind your habit stacks  
* Version notes when models or prompts change  
* Plain-language summaries of data sources tied to each insight  

**Balancing personalization with digital well-being**

More personalization can mean more messages. The fix is respectful cadence. Apps should scale nudges up during restarts and taper down as you rebuild consistency. Quiet hours protect sleep. Friction controls matter too. A single setting should pause all non-critical prompts during deep work. Weekly summaries help you keep the big picture without living in charts. If the system senses stress from too many interactions-more dismissals, faster scrolls-it should suggest a leaner plan for the next week.

Practical well-being guardrails:

* Quiet hours with overrides for only the most important health reminders  
* Nudge budgets that cap the number of prompts per day  
* A weekly “do less” mode for heavy weeks  
* Mood-aware adjustments that reduce complexity when you report strain  

**Personal experience:** I ran a month-long test with strict quiet hours from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. and a nudge budget of three per day. My completion rate did not drop. It rose slightly because I trusted that the few prompts I received would actually matter. The coach learned to pack useful suggestions near calendar transitions and to skip late-night pings entirely. I slept better and still stayed on track.

**Book insight:** *Digital Minimalism* by Cal Newport - the principle of intentional technology use supports setting strong default boundaries for notifications so tools serve your values rather than hijack attention (Chapter 1, p. 28–45; pagination may vary by edition). 

**Comparing AI vs Human Coaches**

The question is not “either or.” It is when to lean on AI for execution and when to work with a person for depth and nuance. Think of AI as the engine that keeps your routines moving and a human coach as the strategist who helps you reframe goals, beliefs, and context.

**Where AI coaching outperforms traditional methods**

AI wins on availability, cost, and data-driven adjustments. It is always on, it scales to countless micro-interactions each week, and it spots patterns most people miss-like the exact window when you reliably do a short walk or the meeting slot that kills your focus. It remembers every rep, surfaces micro-trends, and suggests the smallest possible next step. For daily accountability and habit execution, that consistency is hard to beat.

**Emotional intelligence gaps between AI and humans**

There are moments when a text summary of your mood is not enough. A human coach reads tone, body language, and unspoken hesitation. They can challenge a story you keep telling yourself or hold space when a setback hits hard. AI can prompt reflection and suggest coping tools, yet it will not replace compassionate presence. The best systems acknowledge this by easing off when emotional cues suggest you need a person, not a prompt.

**Hybrid coaching models that combine AI with human support**

Hybrid models are gaining ground. You do weekly or monthly sessions with a human, then run a daily plan through AI. The coach and the app share a simple scoreboard: streaks, energy levels, and blockers. Your human sessions focus on strategy and identity shifts, while the app maintains daily cadence. This division lets you invest money where it matters-meaningful conversations-while keeping the cost of daily support low.

**Personal experience:** I once hit a wall despite perfect streaks. The AI showed consistent completion, yet my energy dropped. A short session with a human coach revealed I was pursuing a goal for external approval. We rewired the outcome from “run five days” to “move four days and feel calm after.” The AI then adjusted cadence and timing. My energy rebounded within a week because the plan finally matched my real why.

**Book insight:** *Mindset* by Carol S. Dweck - the growth mindset framing helps human and AI coaches reinforce learning from setbacks rather than treating dips as failures (Chapter 3, p. 52–73). 

# Future of AI in Personal Development

Emerging tools do more than send reminders. They interpret context from multiple signals, they summarize your week like a thoughtful mentor, and they help you choose the smallest action that changes the trajectory of your day.

**Predictions for next-gen AI habit tracking tools**

Expect more on-device intelligence for sensitive data, richer model cards that explain limitations, and cross-app orchestration that sets up your environment-muting notifications, dimming lights, queuing a playlist-so the habit “just happens.” You will also see better relapse detection. When the system senses drift, it will propose a lighter routine for two weeks and schedule a quick review to prevent the all-or-nothing crash.

**How multimodal AI could transform coaching**

Multimodal inputs-text, voice, and camera-will unlock faster feedback loops. A form-check snapshot can correct a squat in seconds. A short voice note after a tough meeting can trigger a decompression ritual and adjust tomorrow’s plan. Combined with calendar context and sleep data, the coach can propose a right-sized plan that respects your state instead of fighting it.

**Opportunities for personalized growth in the AI era**

Personalization is not only about efficiency. It is about building a life that feels aligned. Your coach will learn which two or three keystone habits ripple into everything else-sleep timing, daily walk, evening shutdown-and protect those first. With fewer moving parts and clearer priorities, the rest of your goals stop feeling like a grind and start feeling like momentum.

**Personal experience:** I used to chase five goals at once and stall by week three. Shifting to two keystone habits-consistent lights-out and a ten-minute morning walk-quieted the noise. The coach guarded those slots and treated everything else as optional. Focus improved, and the rest followed naturally because the foundation was stable.

**Book insight:** *Essentialism* by Greg McKeown - the disciplined pursuit of less maps cleanly to AI coaching that protects a small set of high-impact habits before adding anything new (Chapter 7, p. 85–96). 

# FAQ

**What is the fastest way to start with AI coaching if I am overwhelmed?** Pick one outcome that matters this month. Translate it into a two-minute starter habit and one optional extension. Schedule both after a reliable daily anchor like brushing teeth or ending the first meeting. Let the app nudge you only in that window for a week, then review.

**Do I need a wearable for effective AI coaching?** No. Wearables improve readiness signals, yet calendar context and simple check-ins already power useful suggestions. Start without a device and add one later if you want sleep and activity insights.

**How do I avoid notification overload?** Set quiet hours, a daily nudge budget, and one weekly summary. If your app supports it, enable “restart mode” after breaks so prompts scale down before they scale up.

**Can AI coaching help with work performance as well as health?** Yes. The same mechanics-habit stacking, context-aware prompts, and tiny next steps-support deep work blocks, inbox hygiene, and meeting preparation. Many people start with health because feedback is quick, then extend the playbook to focus and time management.

**How do I keep my data safe while using these tools?** Favor apps with clear privacy diagrams, limited permissions, and easy export or deletion. Skim public reviews and vendor documentation as of mid-2025, and check basic signals like domain ownership and tech stack disclosures to verify claims match reality.

**What should I do when I fall off the routine?** Use a two-step reset: shrink the habit to a one-minute version and attach it to a strong anchor for three days. Ask the app to pause all extras and only protect that micro version. Once confidence returns, add the next step.

**Is premium worth it for most users?** If you want adaptive scheduling, richer analytics, and quick capture across devices, premium often pays for itself through higher follow-through. If budget is tight, rotate a single paid month each quarter to refresh insights and export data.

**How do I blend AI and human coaching?** Use AI for daily execution and a human coach for monthly or quarterly strategy and reflection. Share a simple scoreboard so both layers work from the same picture of progress and constraints.

**Personal experience:** When I stopped treating the app like a scoreboard and started treating it like a partner that adjusts with me, I felt less guilt and more momentum. The difference was setting fewer goals and letting the coach defend the anchors that created outsized impact.

It promises a balance of sheer and shimmering pigment, creating a natural yet radiant finish. The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek, lightweight design, which makes it incredibly easy to slip into even the tiniest of clutches or makeup bags. At just 0.1 ounces, you'd barely notice you’re carrying it around.

**Good Points**  
- Glides on smoothly without feeling sticky  
- Long-lasting color despite its sheer finish  
- Compact and travel-friendly packaging  
- Lightweight, comfortable wear for hours  

Tried it out during a humid afternoon, and much to my surprise, it held up remarkably well with only minimal touch-ups required. That staying power is a huge bonus for someone like me, who admittedly forgets to reapply makeup throughout the day. The touch of shimmer it provides is just enough to elevate your look without feeling overwhelming. This product strikes a balance between polish and approachability.

**Shortcomings**  
- Limited shade range might not cater to all skin tones  
- Slight transfer onto cups or glasses  
- Might feel a bit drying after extended wear  

While it excels in performance, I noticed a small downside when it comes to hydration. After a full day of wear, my lips felt slightly dry, which could be an issue for people with already chapped lips. It's not a deal-breaker since a bit of lip balm beforehand fixes the problem, but it’s a consideration.

**Rival Brands**  
Comparing this to other liquid lipsticks in the same price range, such as Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink or Revlon Ultra HD Matte, the stila Stay All Day Sheer offers a much more comfortable finish. Both competitors tend to dry down to a heavier and slightly less forgiving formula. However, where stila falls a little short is in the diversity of shades available. Brands like Revlon and Maybelline offer an extensive variety, which gives you more freedom in choosing a color that fits your mood or outfit.

**Value Proposition**  
For its price point, it's a solid option in the premium liquid lipstick category. The quality of the pigments and the comfort it provides make it worth considering, though a broader shade range or added hydration would put it over the top. If you’re looking for a lipstick that transitions seamlessly from day to night and offers a good dose of glamour, this one’s a winner.

1nqwv4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sagittarians/comments/1nqwv4c/i_could_use_some_insight/,I could use some insight.,"Hi, 36, Sagittarius, BPD, DID, heterosexual cis-man… idk why I figured it’s a good way to clear up who I am…

A woman I feel in love with and dated for about a year ended the relationship. (33, Virgo, pansexual, cis-woman) she was reserved and as our dating went on I could feel her pull away, the day it ended she seemed different and annoyed. I can’t really tell facial expressions and I’m known to overthink words a lot so I am usually pretty straight forward with what I say and ask. When I asked if she was ok, she said fine. And said if you’re really fine that’s ok. But if you wanted to share anything else I would like to listen. She said no and we continued. She continued to be annoyed with me and goofing around a bit. When it came time for bed she said you could play fallout on Amazon. I said no way and she was full of it. She aggressively shows me the ad and asks, “why am I being such a little bitch today?” I froze, she never talked to me like that before. Were into some heavy bedroom play but humiliation was never on my list and nor hers so I knew she meant it. 

The next morning I was frozen in depression. The woman I grew to love and hope to start a relationship with just cut me down in a way I never knew. My insecurities were creeping in. I could hear my mother say, “no one will ever love you the way I do.” Look at it now it’s just a mother’s words towards their kids. But to me, and the many abusive and manipulative ex’s I was with and one engaged to saying the same thing to me. All I could hear was I was “unlovable, intolerable, useless, and crazy.” I finally arose and she had passively aggressively made me coffee and wouldn’t look at me. I gathered my courage to ask if we could talk about last night. She whips her head around and said “yeah, we should talk.” I tried to stay calm and not let an identity out because I’ve started EMDR a couple years prior and working on being primary and not disassociate in serious conversations. She kept getting defensive with everything I was saying. And I would ask questions about some things that were on my mind to try and understand, I noticed before bed a guy texted her a few times. I didn’t think anything of it till she called me a bitch that maybe she is on her way out? And so I asked if this plus this guy are some how connected. And she asked me my thoughts. “Well I grabbed your phone for you because you had wondered to bed without it so I grabbed it to give you and noticed this guys name and 4 unread texts. I wouldn’t ever think you’d cheat on me but maybe he was looking for closure on something, maybe he’s a friend that I haven’t met that needed a hand.” But before I could get to any of that she yelled at me and I disassociated and I guess I had yelled back and said something mean. I apologized and ask if we can try again and she wouldn’t. I asked is she over me and this relationship and she didn’t answer me. I asked once again and added if you can just answer me yes or no that would really help me. Again, she said nothing and began to cry… I told her I’m gunna take it as a yes. I proceeded to pack up all my things, telling her my struggles, my insecurities, my highs in the time we spent and hopes that she is happy and will find what she’s looking for. All while crying my eyes out. We hugged and said goodbye.

Flash forward to a few months later.

I started seeing, not dating, an ex that was manipulative and abusive. She is nice (40, Leo, heterosexual, cis-woman.) and Virgo reached out. She said she wanted to be friends and if I was available to hangout because she was in town. I said of course, and we hung out that day. It was nice, she’s quiet but found my babbling endearing, l asked her if she wanted to go see a movie and when we went to the theater we were asked to evict the building because of a gas leak. I was fresh out of ideas. She asked if we can go back to my place and watch something. I asked if you’re ok with that then that’s ok. Once we got to my place we talked seriously, I know she’s like me and would like a heads up when serious talk is coming up because it gets overwhelming. But she initiated and I wanted to be respectful. It didn’t feel like an apology but it offered clarity. The guy was an old crush that would talk from time to time and tell her about his woes, she did start to pull away because “that’s what she does”, and she said she missed me. I was thankful and she and I also proceeded to see each other. Again, not dating. 

A couple months go by and Virgo wanted an answer. Her or Leo. I needed time to think and what I concluded was Leo was a seriously kind person. She has amazing style, easily approachable, amazing family, and was very much in love with me. Virgo, she avoids conflict, she’s GORGEOUS, she’s has hobbies opposite of mine and I loved getting involved with some of her things. (She once said she’d read to me if I ever wanted to and I desperately wanted that.) and the sex was without a doubt top tier. But I can’t have her avoid topics and I wanted some real back and forth with emotions and feelings because that’s unfortunately all I got. I told Virgo I’m gunna start exclusively dating Leo. She was not happy and really let me have it. I understood and accepted what she felt about me and that was that. 

Here’s were I’m not a good person…

A couple months pass.

Virgo hit me up for help with electrical problem. I’m an electrician, Leo and I are not on good grounds, and I wanted to see and talk to Virgo again, so I go and help her out we talk and catch up and she asks me about Leo, I say we’re good but she presses, I tell her the truth and she seemed upset to hear that. Once I finished helping her she asked if I wanted to stay? She’s got a pool and bought me a 6 pack of my favorite beer. We started talking and laughing and showing each other new music we’ve found. We’re done in the pool and decided to watch a movie that came out and we went and changed, I went into her room after we were both done changing and looking at her she was beautiful and I thought back to the time we had and how I missed that. We embraced and kissed. The rest of the day was us hold each other and anything but penetrated sex. We talked for a bit afterwards and I was starting to. Feel guilty, I knew what I did was horribly wrong and riddled by guilt she asked if we could be together. I panicked and we cut ties there…. I had never felt like that since I had lost my dog earlier that time and I had felt like I fucked up.

Time goes on, and we’re today,

I’m doing my best to make this relationship with a woman who all my friends love! People love her, she’s adored by all. But why the fuck am I not there!? I  am getting ready to head back to my hometown for the weekend and I hope online and see Virgo is in a relationship I yelled at the top of my lungs and pullover and put on sleep token, a band that she loved and haven’t listened to because it just reminds me of her. And cried till I had snot dripping from my nose and dry heaving from the lack of oxygen I’m taking in. Out of a pathetic attempt an identity started messaging her roommate, noticing this I snap out of crying and try to stop it but it too late and of course her. Room mate was pretty upset and she’s not one to just let things slide. 

Virgo has blocked me on social media, I’m left here broken hearted again for reasons I can’t understand, and my relationship with Leo is even rockier than it was ever before. I’m not a good man. But I want to be, I want to be so badly it hurts. I want to hold my head up high and feel ray of warm light hit the top of my head down to my feet and radiate the love and happiness I give. But I’m afraid and afraid to do anything.",2,1758879137.0,Sagittarians,0,1.0,False

1nqwue0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqwue0,AIO? I have become convinced the admin at my local Irish hospital are dangerously incompetent!,"Don't get me wrong. The nurses and doctors at St. Michael’s Hospital in Dublin are excellent and we get on very well. I'm in a clinic where it's necessary for me to go in somewhat regularly and have some blood taken, it impacts my iron levels. I love the staff. Unfortunately, their colleagues over in administration are walking-talking liabilities.

While I won’t catalogue every last problem that myself and other local residents in our area have experienced over the past 50+ years - it's kind of a known problem - the following 3 bureaucratic ‘screw-ups’ which have affected me personally over the past decade might serve as quite a good example.

After I tell my long and rambling story, you can study their apology letters from 2016, 2021 & 2025 yourselves - I have redacted all names, email addresses and so forth. This isn't personal, it's institutional.

Note that in each of their 3 apology letters, St. Michael’s Hospital not only totally, freely admit their wrong-doing, but also earnestly promise change - before proceeding to just do the whole thing all over again. When I say ‘all over again’ I don’t just mean making more or less the same mistakes. I also mean spitting out the same apologies again, same promises again and just never seeming to be aware of any contradiction or erosion of their credibility. It's like they're not fully there or are using scripted phrases. Then just repeating the same behaviour.

Put on some coffee, because this gets quite boring!

A. In 2016, the hospital sent me 4 different appointment letters with respect to the one appointment. There were absolutely no changes at my end, whatsoever, at any stage in the process. I literally just received 4 different times / dates for the one appointment, all proudly presented on the hospital's headed paper.

I was really scratching my head. The administrative staff couldn’t explain it. They were neither helpful nor particularly nice about it - so I felt it was important to just make a formal complaint. It's a hospital, after all and this kind of thing was hardly trivial. What about elderly or otherwise vulnerable people? So I provided evidence of the 4 contradictory appointment letters to them. I did my bit. As you can see from their first 2016 apology letter, the hospital totally conceded that what I had described / proven had indeed occurred and promised to do better. My reaction at the time was... well, fair enough!

B. In 2020, it happened again. They didn’t send out 4 different letters this time. Instead, I received 2 letters, from 2 completely different departments in the hospital and in relation to 2 totally different appointments that weren't connected. Problem was, they were both scheduled for exactly the same time & date & person - me! St. Michael's Hospital was effectively ‘double-booking’ me, without any protest from their own system. 

I wearily dug up that old letter from 2016, read it through a second time and scratched my head once more. That old promise of change was beginning to ring hollow. If they could send out 4 letters for a single appointment back then, and 2 letters for the same date and time and person now... was this, perhaps, just how they rolled? I curiously rang the woman who had written the letter four years earlier and put her on the spot. That's when things started to really get weird. Infuriatingly, she claimed there was absolutely no connection whatsoever between what had happened then and what was happening now! 

Different departments - she said - different problem! At this point, I became incensed and said “No, No, No, No, NO!” She also started to sound unhappy and told me she would end the call. I childishly said, “No, I will end this call!” and hung up on her. I may have been annoyed because of my trusting her apology / reassurances four years earlier, and was only now realising she hadn't meant or even understood what she'd written. So I then made a second formal complaint, referring to dodgy appointments 1-4 back in 2016 and these new dodgy appointments 5-6 in 2020. 

St. Michael’s replied by once again admitting to the error, once again promising to do better and crucially still failing to recognise any connection between what had happened back then and what was happening now! The person writing this reply was the woman I had rudely hung up on. She lied about having said there was simply no connection between the 4 dodgy appointments back then and the 2 dodgy appointments now, claiming she had been referring to something totally different - but then, incredibly, proceeded to take the same position all over again: claiming that 1-4 and 5-6 were unconnected.

You can read it yourself. 

When she made all the same promises again, on behalf of the one hospital, she even used some similar phrasing. I was starting to get the picture. These letters were just their way of placating people and the outfit actually had little intention of engaging in any real change. Things would probably stay the same. I appealed their decision to the Irish Ombudsman who upheld my complaint about them not recognising a connection. But it took a long time for the Ombudsman to do that, and the hospital never commented on the result, so I was left wondering what the point of it was.

C. Still awake? You can probably see where this is going! In 2025, lo and behold, it happened all over again. The finer details were ever so slightly different, but the problem was basically the same. I was being sent yet more dodgy appointments in the post. This time it was a string of hospital letterheads offering me an appointment at 9am on a Saturday, despite my repeatedly telephoning and politely telling them I was unavailable at that time due to a completely different treatment. Like, I had specified this in advance.

I did it - I made a third formal complaint. In this final one, I stressed that if their 3rd apology letter did not FINALLY acknowledge this clear pattern of sending out erroneous appointments, or recognise the need for deeper structural change in their admin section, I would release all their letters publicly. 

A month later I got their response. You guessed it - the letter was basically the same. They were singing the same old tune! Making no reference whatsoever to their 2016 and 2020/21 issues and simply repeating their apology and promises of change, all over a \*\*\*\*\*\*\* again. No need for them to actually change, when they can just fire out these insincere letters, right? I asked them to review their 3rd complaint response and they did so. Now, 20 days later, they have come back and upheld their 3rd complaint response. They reeeeaallly reckon this is okay.

In this most recent letter, they also take a moment to inform me that during the nine year period of my complaints A / B / C between 2016-2025, no more than 16 other complaints like mine were ever received from other patients. In other words, complaints of this nature, complaints about more or less the same thing? Only 16 others, aside from mine!

That’s less than 2 such complaints a year - and they stress that even in that tiny number of instances, even when it did very occasionally happen, the patients were never harmed and everything was resolved. 

Needless to say, if this were rare, it obviously wouldn't have happened to the same guy 3 separate times / across 8 erroneous letters!

Perhaps they were trying to gently imply that it was me causing the problem?

BUT THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT AFTER THEY HAVE ALREADY FORMALLY ADMITTED TO SENDING ME 8 ERRONEOUS LETTERS.

Clearly, I described all 8 erroneous letters in three formal letters of complaint, at the rate of 4, 2, 2 and St. Michael's wrote back letters EACH TIME confirming that - upon careful investigation - they admitted all 8 errors DID indeed occur. It's not disputed.

Obviously, if it happened 8 times to one guy over 9 years, it ain't rare ;)

I believe it's a lot more likely that what's rare is idiots like me who take / make the necessary time & effort to complain properly and not just forget about the whole annoying thing. I don't blame other patients for forgetting about it - in fact, I envy their doing so. Part of me wishes I had not made this sincere effort, especially as it's clearly not improving what the hospital does.

St. Michael’s Hospital in Dublin is part of St. Vincent’s Healthcare Group and there is also a degree of accreditation by an international group called the Joint Commission - both of these other parties were copied the third complaint, which referred in detail to the previous two, so can't claim they don’t know about the case.

I definitely won’t be making any more complaints about admin to my local Irish hospital and the simple reason is they don’t absorb them. Even writing the Irish Ombudsman didn't help and I am certainly not going to take legal action or anything like that. Think I'm done.

But would be curious to know if people feel I am overreacting, here?",1,1758879058.0,AmIOverreacting,8,1.0,False

I’m 20 years old and have just been newly diagnosed with Crohns disease and have been feeling a lot of anxiety of what it means for my future. I’m currently on Prednisolone for 8 weeks weaning off it just to get down the inflammation, but I’m terrified of what’s to come after that. If anyone has any good stories about starting a medication that worked for them and your life went back to nearly normal because of it, I’d love to hear it right now 🥹. I used to love baking goodies, going out to restaurants and trying sweet treats and desserts, or just any new food. I’m feeling extremely depressed thinking that is now a thing of the past and I won’t just be able to eat anything anymore. Eating yummy foods and desserts was something that brought me great joy in life and kept me motivated :( Getting a caramel frappe or iced coffee was something that motivated me to study for example.. adding a yummy food to doing something can make it so much more fun. I’m feeling so much grief about it. 
On top of that, I’m really worrying about what it means for getting a job, I’m currently working casually delivering pizza which is 3 hour shifts so i’ve been able to handle them, but before my diagnosis I was applying for and wanted to find full time work in admin/ reception positions. I feel at a freeze in my life now as I don’t know how my health is going to be whether I’ll even be able to work something full time.

The set includes a Polypropylene (PP) filter, a Coconut Shell Activated Carbon (CTO) filter, a Post Carbon Filter (PCF), and a Reverse Osmosis (RO) membrane—each meticulously organized and built to last. Handling the filters, they feel sturdy, and you really get the sense that they’re crafted with quality in mind. I liked knowing that even the RO membrane, which does the heavy lifting of removing contaminants, promises an impressive two-year lifespan compared to the typical one-year filters.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
I’m not the most technically adept person, but installation was unexpectedly simple. The filters don’t require special tools or the hassle of shutting off the main water line. Swapping out the old ones for new took me less than five minutes, and everything clicked securely into place. Resetting the filter lifespan using the system’s interface was straightforward, but I do recommend carefully reading the instructions since fumbling around could reset the wrong filter. 

**Perks**  
- The four distinct filters ensure a layered, comprehensive filtration process for maximum water quality.  
- Convenient, tool-free replacement saves time and headaches.  
- Extended lifespan, especially of the RO membrane, reduces how often you need to reorder supplies.  
- Reliable and friendly customer support provides added peace of mind.  

**Performance and Water Quality**  
This filter set truly steps up. Post-installation, I immediately noticed the improved taste and clarity of my tap water. It's a night-and-day difference compared to skipping filter replacements, which, honestly, I had been guilty of many times before. The activated carbon filter effectively neutralized odors, and the RO membrane gave me peace of mind knowing microscopic contaminants are filtered out. From making coffee to cooking pasta, my water quality has gone from ""meh"" to high-end bottled water taste.

**Limitations**  
- The initial cost of buying the 4-pack bundle might feel hefty, even though it lasts longer.  
- Depending on your water source, overuse could shorten the filter lifespan, especially for the pre-filters (PP and CTO).  
- The filter reset button on the system is intuitive but can lead to confusion if you mistakenly select the wrong filter to reset.  

**Comparison to Competing Products**  
Having tried other water filtration systems, such as the AquaTru series and the Brita countertop units, I think this set excels in critical areas while lagging slightly in others. The AquaTru filters also deliver amazing results but are often pricier over time due to limited lifespan. Meanwhile, Brita systems are cost-effective but don't match the advanced filtering capability of Bluevua's RO membrane. In terms of value and technical ease, this bundle strikes a good balance. I’d say the Bluevua set works best for those who prefer long-term efficiency combined with premium water quality.

**Value for Money**  
After running these filters for a couple of weeks, I’d confidently argue that this bundle is cost-efficient, given its long-term consistency. One major advantage is the two-year lifespan of the RO membrane, which reduces how often replacements are needed. While initially more expensive than certain brands, the layers of advanced filtration and reliability make it a worthy companion for anyone serious about their water quality.

1nqwkz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nqwkz5/aio_i_have_become_convinced_the_administration_in/,AIO? I have become convinced the administration in my local hospital has become dangerously incompetent!,"Don't get me wrong. The nurses and doctors at St. Michael’s Hospital in Dublin are excellent and we get on very well. I'm in a clinic where it's necessary for me to go in somewhat regularly and have some blood taken, it impacts my iron levels. I love the staff. Unfortunately, their colleagues over in administration are walking-talking liabilities.

While I won’t catalogue every last problem that myself and other local residents in our area have experienced over the past 50+ years - it's kind of a known problem - the following 3 bureaucratic ‘screw-ups’ which have affected me personally over the past decade might serve as quite a good example.

After I tell my long and rambling story, you can study their apology letters from 2016, 2021 & 2025 yourselves - I have redacted all names, email addresses and so forth. This isn't personal, it's institutional.

Note that in each of their 3 apology letters, St. Michael’s Hospital not only totally, freely admit their wrong-doing, but also earnestly promise change - before proceeding to just do the whole thing all over again. When I say ‘all over again’ I don’t just mean making more or less the same mistakes. I also mean spitting out the same apologies again, same promises again and just never seeming to be aware of any contradiction or erosion of their credibility. It's like they're not fully there or are using scripted phrases. Then just repeating the same behaviour.

Put on some coffee, because this gets quite boring!



1. In 2016, the hospital sent me 4 different appointment letters with respect to the one appointment. There were absolutely no changes at my end, whatsoever, at any stage in the process. I literally just received 4 different times / dates for the one appointment, all proudly presented on the hospital's headed paper.

I was really scratching my head. The administrative staff couldn’t explain it. They were neither helpful nor particularly nice about it - so I felt it was important to just make a formal complaint. It's a hospital, after all and this kind of thing was hardly trivial. What about elderly or otherwise vulnerable people? So I provided evidence of the 4 contradictory appointment letters to them. I did my bit. As you can see from their first 2016 apology letter, the hospital totally conceded that what I had described / proven had indeed occurred and promised to do better. My reaction at the time was... well, fair enough!





2. In 2020, it happened again. They didn’t send out 4 different letters this time. Instead, I received 2 letters, from 2 completely different departments in the hospital and in relation to 2 totally different appointments that weren't connected. Problem was, they were both scheduled for exactly the same time & date & person - me! St. Michael's Hospital was effectively ‘double-booking’ me, without any protest from their own system. 

I wearily dug up that old letter from 2016, read it through a second time and scratched my head once more. That old promise of change was beginning to ring hollow. If they could send out 4 letters for a single appointment back then, and 2 letters for the same date and time and person now... was this, perhaps, just how they rolled? I curiously rang the woman who had written the letter four years earlier and put her on the spot. That's when things started to really get weird. Infuriatingly, she claimed there was absolutely no connection whatsoever between what had happened then and what was happening now! 

Different departments - she said - different problem! At this point, I became incensed and said “No, No, No, No, NO!” She also started to sound unhappy and told me she would end the call. I childishly said, “No, I will end this call!” and hung up on her. I may have been annoyed because of my trusting her apology / reassurances four years earlier, and was only now realising she hadn't meant or even understood what she'd written. So I then made a second formal complaint, referring to dodgy appointments 1-4 back in 2016 and these new dodgy appointments 5-6 in 2020. 

St. Michael’s replied by once again admitting to the error, once again promising to do better and crucially still failing to recognise any connection between what had happened back then and what was happening now! The person writing this reply was the woman I had rudely hung up on. She lied about having said there was simply no connection between the 4 dodgy appointments back then and the 2 dodgy appointments now, claiming she had been referring to something totally different - but then, incredibly, proceeded to take the same position all over again: claiming that 1-4 and 5-6 were unconnected.

You can read it yourself. 

When she made all the same promises again, on behalf of the one hospital, she even used some similar phrasing. I was starting to get the picture. These letters were just their way of placating people and the outfit actually had little intention of engaging in any real change. Things would probably stay the same. I appealed their decision to the Irish Ombudsman who upheld my complaint about them not recognising a connection. But it took a long time for the Ombudsman to do that, and the hospital never commented on the result, so I was left wondering what the point of it was.





3. Still awake? You can probably see where this is going! In 2025, lo and behold, it happened all over again. The finer details were ever so slightly different, but the problem was basically the same. I was being sent yet more dodgy appointments in the post. This time it was a string of hospital letterheads offering me an appointment at 9am on a Saturday, despite my repeatedly telephoning and politely telling them I was unavailable at that time due to a completely different treatment. Like, I had specified this in advance.

I did it - I made a third formal complaint. In this final one, I stressed that if their 3rd apology letter did not FINALLY acknowledge this clear pattern of sending out erroneous appointments, or recognise the need for deeper structural change in their admin section, I would release all their letters publicly. 

A month later I got their response. You guessed it - the letter was basically the same. They were singing the same old tune! Making no reference whatsoever to their 2016 and 2020/21 issues and simply repeating their apology and promises of change, all over a \*\*\*\*\*\*\* again. No need for them to actually change, when they can just fire out these insincere letters, right? I asked them to review their 3rd complaint response and they did so. Now, 20 days later, they have come back and upheld their 3rd complaint response. They reeeeaallly reckon this is okay.

In this most recent letter, they also take a moment to inform me that during the nine year period of my complaints 1 / 2 / 3 between 2016-2025, no more than 16 other complaints like mine were ever received from other patients. In other words, complaints of this nature, complaints about more or less the same thing? Only 16 others, aside from mine!

That’s less than 2 such complaints a year - and they stress that even in that tiny number of instances, even when it did very occasionally happen, the patients were never harmed and everything was resolved. 

Needless to say, if this were rare, it obviously wouldn't have happened to the same guy 3 separate times / across 8 erroneous letters!

Perhaps they were trying to gently imply that it was me causing the problem?

BUT THAT WOULD DIFFICULT AFTER THEY HAVE ALREADY FORMALLY ADMITTED TO SENDING ME 8 ERRONEOUS LETTERS.

Clearly, I described all 8 erroneous letters in three formal letters of complaint, at the rate of 4, 2, 2 and St. Michael's wrote back letters EACH TIME confirming that - upon careful investigation - they admitted all 8 errors DID indeed occur. It's not disputed.

Obviously, if it happened 8 times to one guy over 9 years, it ain't rare ;)

I believe it's a lot more likely that what's rare is idiots like me who take / make the necessary time & effort to complain properly and not just forget about the whole annoying thing. I don't blame other patients for forgetting about it - in fact, I envy their doing so. Part of me wishes I had not made this sincere effort, especially as it's clearly not improving what the hospital does.

St. Michael’s Hospital in Dublin is part of St. Vincent’s Healthcare Group and there is also a degree of accreditation by an international group called the Joint Commission - both of these other parties were copied the third complaint, which referred in detail to the previous two ones, so can't claim they don’t know about the case.

I definitely won’t be making any more complaints about admin to my local hospital and the simple reason is they don’t absorb them.

But would be curious to know if people feel I am overreacting, here?",1,1758878013.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.67,False

My flight wasn’t until much later in the evening, so I had this awkward gap where I had to lug my giant suitcase around with me.

To make things more interesting (or disastrous), I also happened to have a first date lined up that afternoon. She picked this cute little coffee shop in the centre of town. She walked in looking all put together, and there I was, sweaty and awkward, dragging around this massive suitcase that basically felt like a third wheel on the date lol. 

We tried to find a seat but the bag kept bumping into tables and chairs, knocking into people’s feet. At one point, I almost tripped over the handle trying to move it out of the way. The barista gave me this look like “Is he moving in here or what?”

The date itself went okay once we both started laughing about it, but the whole time I felt like the suitcase had completely hijacked my vibe. Hard to be smooth when your luggage is literally bigger than the chair you’re sitting on. By the end of it, I just wanted to teleport the bag somewhere else so I could actually focus.

I’m writing this completely emotionally drained. Between my job and trying to keep up with everything my wife expects of me, I feel like I’m running on fumes. It’s been this way for years. I work a demanding full-time job and bring in the vast majority of our income, coming home tired most days. Instead of being able to recharge, it feels like there’s just a huge list of requirements waiting for me, rarely even a greeting. No matter what I do, it’s never enough, and the sheer volume of tight rules ensures that one is always broken.

We’ve been together 10 years, married almost 2, and we have an 8-year-old son. She didn’t work for years and now has a very part-time “favor” job helping an elder, which only brings in a little. On her days off, she homeschools our son, but also spends a lot of time on shows or in drama with her adult kids. She keeps the house only at a basic level, and rarely cooks, though she does well when she goes out to get groceries or other necessities. I initially had no problem with her not working or only working part time, but I expected that she would compensate in other areas.

I try to speak her love language: nightly back rubs, morning coffees, snack runs, etc. I even watch her church services with her twice a week as a show of support. I bought her dream car. I make sure most of our outings on evenings and weekends revolve around her interests, like coffee shops, specialty clothing stores, farmer’s markets, and similar activities. Still, she says she doesn’t feel emotionally connected because I’m not meeting her standards, and that I frequently offend her or break her rules.

Intimacy is rare, and when it does happen, it’s 100% me doing all the work, focused on pleasing her. Then she just rolls over to allow me to finish. I’m not even allowed to take care of myself without prior approval, and pornography is completely off the table.

Her religious shift has made life even more rigid.  Hallmark-only shows, no beach outings with her and our son because of “worldly” inappropriately dressed people, mandatory church services on sundays and wednesday evenings, and lots of criticism of the world in general.

The truth is, I feel completely worn down trying to live up to her standards and neuroticism. I feel like I’ve poured myself out trying to be what she wants, and yet she keeps moving the finish line. In the end, it feels unbalanced to me, and I don’t feel appreciated enough. Or am I wrong?

There is way more to this, but I don't want to make it a book.

1nqwge5,https://i.redd.it/yck3gd6x5hrf1.jpeg,Overpriced,"Starbucks is the leading coffee shop chain in the world, with more than 38,000 stores globally, but its steady price increases are starting to turn away customers and that’s taking a toll on the company’s bottom line.  
In May, Starbucks reported a rare decline in sales and guest traffic in the latest quarter, marking its first negative performance since pandemic-related store closures in 2020. During an April earnings call, CEO Laxman Narasimhan said budget-conscious customers have been more careful about their spending.

Indeed, many Starbucks fans have expressed their frustrations online. “Seems like Starbucks is raising prices every month since Jan 2024. It’s so ridiculous,” wrote one customer, noting that the price of their go-to order (an iced triple shot latte with soy milk, cold foam, and added syrup) had increased three times since January. Six months ago, that order was $5.40. By April 2024, that same order came to $6. “I am slowly turning to my Nespresso machine to make my drink now,” that same Redditor said.

Even Starbucks workers are getting fed up with rising prices: “I wonder how much higher Starbucks is going to raise their prices,” one employee wrote in a StarbucksBaristas subreddit. “I can’t even afford my drink WITH my discount. They’re pricing out their own employees and the fact that they don’t see an issue with that is seriously concerning.”

Some info about me: I’m an above average guy (in terms of looks) and I dress very well for my city.

So I was standing at the bus stop the other day, and this really cute girl came to the same stop.

This bus stop is pretty big and has multiple benched areas, but she decided to stand really close to me.

When she first got here, she was looking in the complete opposite direction of the way most people were looking to see if the bus was coming. And the entire time she had one of her feet pointed at me. 

I also noticed her glancing back and to the side at me, and facing her entire body towards me a few times as well while we were waiting for our respective buses. I might be hallucinating here but it also seemed like she may have pointed her phone camera at me? Granted, it was in the same hand as her coffee, and she was taking a sip, so I might just be trippin.

Anyway, my bus came before hers, and instead of just standing there like most people do, she moved back a little so that I’d have to move in front of her to get onto my bus. And as I was getting on the bus, I could see her looking at me.

Now, it’s clear she was like paying attention to me, but is there anything here that indicates that she wanted me to talk to her?

I struggled to make eye contact (and I think she noticed), cuz I kept looking away whenever she turned to face me. I’m just so shy and can’t help but feel nervous around really cute girls.

1nqweap,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1nqweap/my_saas_product_got_its_first_250/,My SaaS Product Got Its First $250! 🎉,"Hey Reddit fam,

I can't believe this moment is finally here – my SaaS product is generating revenue, and I’m over the moon! 🌕

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns 😅). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

You know the one – ""You've received a payment of $19."" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is Its a software solution that is useful for at least a few reasons I can think of:⁠

1. Its a reddit tool that helps you find the best unmoderated subreddits for you to promote yourself or to claim these subreddits. The database containing the subreddits is constantly updated. Another feature is allowing you to see the best time to post in any sub.
2. Can be used to find abandoned subreddits with active, engaged members but no moderation team. By claiming these subreddits, you take control of a ready-made community in your niche—perfect for building authority, driving traffic, or even monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or memberships. Or if you're just passionate about the topic and want to run it yourself :)
3. ⁠Don’t want to take ownership, you can still use the database to identify subreddits relevant to your niche and post your content, products, or services here.
4. You get the best time to post in a subreddit, this ensuring the best visibility of the post.


Why This Means So Much to Me

I’m not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don’t have a fancy office or a huge team. It’s just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $19 is so much more than just money – it’s validation. It’s proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I’ve built to actually pay for it.

What’s Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it’s time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let’s see how far this can go.

Thanks for reading, and if you’ve been grinding on your own project, let’s hear about it in the comments. Let’s inspire each other. 🚀

1nqwe8t,https://i.redd.it/hq6crn395hrf1.jpeg,225 planes? Turkish Airlines just ordered the sky — and then asked engines for a coffee break.,"Turkish Airlines announced plans to buy 225 Boeing aircraft: 75 Boeing 787 widebodies (50 firm, 25 options) and 150 737-8/10 MAX single-aisles (100 firm, 50 options) — with the 737 purchases conditional on finishing talks with engine maker CFM International. The airline says the Dreamliner deliveries are slated between 2029 and 2034.

Yes, that’s 225 jets. No, that number does not include complimentary peanuts.

What exactly was announced?

75 Boeing 787s (mix of B787-9 and B787-10): 50 firm orders + 25 options. Deliveries scheduled 2029–2034.
150 Boeing 737-8/10 MAX: 100 firm + 50 options — but these will only be placed after successful engine talks with CFM International (the exclusive family of LEAP engines for the MAX).
Turkish Airlines publicly filed the update to the Istanbul Stock Exchange, underlining it as an official corporate decision.
Why now? (Short answer: growth plans + political winds)

Turkish Airlines says the goal is for its entire fleet to be new-generation by 2035, supporting an average annual growth rate of about 6% — so this is fleet-modernization at national-carrier scale.

That ambition ties into broader government-level talks between Turkey and the U.S. — including high-profile meetings between Presidents Erdo?an and Trump — which have recently touched on sanctions, energy purchases and the possibility of thawing ties that could affect defense sales (including talk around the F-35). In short: commercial fleet moves are happening in a very political frame.

The engine subplot (where the drama lives)

Widebodies and narrowbodies require different engine ecosystems:

For the 787s, Turkish Airlines is in talks with Rolls-Royce and GE Aerospace over engines, spares and maintenance packages — a classic “who powers the Dreamliner?” negotiation that involves price, performance, and maintenance contracts.
For the 737-8/10 MAX, the purchase is explicitly subject to talks with CFM International — because the MAX family is tied to the LEAP-1B engine. Those discussions often revolve around price, delivery timing, operational support and discounts: tiny things like “will the engines arrive on time?” tend to matter enormously for airlines.
Translation: the order is large, but not yet fully “signed, sealed, and ready for takeoff” until engine paperwork is buttoned up.

What this means for Boeing (and the suppliers)

Boeing: a headline like “225 aircraft” is a very nice advertisement for Boeing’s order book and a welcome revenue scoop — particularly helpful when plane makers are juggling production rates, supplier capacity and political headwinds.
Engine-makers: CFM (for the MAX) and Rolls-Royce/GE (for the 787s) suddenly have leverage and busy calendars. Expect tough negotiations on price, long-term maintenance deals, and maybe even some industrial offsets or local workshare talk.
Supply chain: Deliveries spaced 2029–2034 give breathing room, but global engine & parts bottlenecks and certification schedules could shape the real timetable.
(Also: if airlines were Pokémon cards, Turkish Airlines just said “Gotta catch ‘em all” — and then asked the engine-makers to trade cards.)

Geopolitics: yes, the White House tea matters

The announcement followed diplomatic interactions between President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump. Their talks reportedly covered energy (Russian oil), possible lifting of some U.S. sanctions, and the potential reopening of conversations about U.S. fighter jets like the F-35.

That diplomatic backdrop sharpens the commercial story: a national carrier’s megadeal doesn’t happen in a vacuum — and aircraft and defense sales often travel together on the geopolitical highway.

What passengers might actually notice

Newer planes (787s and newer MAX variants) generally mean better fuel efficiency, quieter cabins, and upgraded inflight systems.
Longer-term: more non-stop routes, capacity increases, and (hopefully) fewer middle seats that feel like economy-class limbo.
Short-term: little to no immediate change — deliveries start in 2029 — so don’t expect a Dreamliner selfie on your next weekend trip.
Risks and caveats (because every blockbuster needs a plot twist)

Engine deals are still pending — if talks with CFM, Rolls-Royce or GE falter, the 737 and 787 parts of the plan could change.
Delivery schedule: 2029–2034 is a long runway; supply chain disruptions, certification delays or geopolitical shocks could shift that.
Financial angle: Even with financing and discounts, big orders are expensive. Currency moves, interest rates, and passenger demand evolution matter.
Political risk: Bilateral politics (U.S.–Turkey) could accelerate or complicate defense/commercial deals in unexpected ways.
The human (and mildly funny) takeaway

Turkish Airlines just announced a plan that’s equal parts industrial strategy, fleet makeover, and international theater. It’s like ordering a mansion for your in-laws — tasteful, ambitious, and requiring serious coordination with contractors (in this metaphor, the contractors are Rolls-Royce, GE, and CFM). Meanwhile, diplomats are sipping coffee and watching how the contractors respond.

Final thought

Big orders like this reshape airline route maps and factory floors alike. Whether this becomes a landmark fleet renewal or a “standing offer while negotiations continue” depends on engines, geopolitics, and the logistics of turning paper orders into metal birds. Either way, keep your window seat — there’s a lot to watch.

TL; DR

Turkish Airlines announced plans to buy 225 Boeing jets: 75×787s (50 firm + 25 options) and 150×737-8/10 MAX (100 firm + 50 options).
787 deliveries are scheduled 2029–2034; 737 MAX purchases depend on engine talks with CFM International.
Engines for the 787s are being discussed with Rolls-Royce and GE Aerospace (spares & maintenance included).
The announcement sits against a backdrop of recent Erdo?an–Trump talks around sanctions, Russian oil and potential U.S. defense sales — geopolitics is part of the story.

I also experience the same general phenomenon that many post about where a coffee loses its ‘wow factor’ as you work through the bag.

This post is specific to anaerobic processing.

have been lucky to have tried a few really decent anaerobic coffees lately.

The most recent have been a ‘red Bomb’ process by Ozone and a straight anaerobic from Marks.

I’m currently brewing on a Z1.

In both cases, the first few cups after dialling in have hit the flavour notes so vividly (for the two bags above, pomegranate and sour skittles respectively were 100% accurate decsriptions.

However as the bags progress, I’m left with an increasing burnt/rubbery/chemically (don’t know fully how to describe it) taste that I have encountered in poorer anaerobic beans.

I’m not sure if this is normal, or if both the initial amazing cups and subsequent off ones are partially caused by zero bypass brewing.

I feel like the highs have been higher on the initial cups, but the strong ‘anaerobic’ taste more pronounced on subsequent ones with this brewer.

""Han bestemmer seg for å kjøpe en kaffe i kantina.""

= he decides to buy a coffee from the cafeteria.

Why does this sentence have 'for' between 'seg' and 'å'?  
What is it adding to the sentence beyond just saying 'a kjøpe...'?

The only thing I can add is that for context, directly preceding this sentence it says something along the lines of '...but he is struggling to concentrate after reading five chapters of his textbook.'

The amount of drugs with that mechanism is very little but i ended up finding cyproheptadine. Its used for serotonin syndrome so in my mind this is perfect, the usual dose is 16mg for serotonin syndrome, i said what the hell and doubled that since i was feeling desperate. I took 8 4mg pills all at once then i got sleepy and went to bed and when i woke up i felt a very odd feeling, which wasn’t pleasant by any means I’m guessing because it is mainly an antihistamine and has anti dopaminergic properties. 

I felt very agitated the first 4 days but as the days went I’ve been feeling better and better, I’ve become extremely horny also.  And mood wise i feel amazing and finding fun things to do again like i used to do before. Coffee feels amazing i drank like 3 cups in a day. And also i feel more focused and better cognitively. My theory why this works is that once serotonin levels go up it never really goes down on its own with time, and just how it was raised with medication it needs to be lowered with medication also, its a shame there aren’t any clean serotonin antagonists around, so a huge dose of cyproheptadine is needed. 

Warning: my sides hurt for 2 days after that dose, its probably very toxic and draining for the body to take that dose all at once but i felt better after drinking a lot of water and as days passed.

Warning 2: while my depression and anhedonia is a lot better my anxiety is back with a vengeance, both physical and mental, i feel chest tightness and i get intrusive thoughts which really suck.",1,1758876852.0,anhedonia,1,1.0,False

1nqw5kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTurkey/comments/1nqw5kd/turkish_friendships/,Turkish friendships,"Merhabalar, I (f) am going to live in Türkiye long-term with my partner. Until now, I’ve been traveling back and forth to the country. I only just started learning the language. 

I’m trying to make friends with Turkish girls here, and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t like to generalize, but usually I don’t have much trouble making friends. Back home, I have close friendships and never had issues. Here in Türkiye though, I can’t say that even one girl I’ve met has really become a friend.

In my experience, people are very warm at first, but then they withdraw completely and don’t seem to care, or coming on the surface, but distant underneath, and not so clear in their intentions. Some examples,
A girl talks with you all evening,  make a picture together, sends it to other girls and follows you on instagram, but then when you tag her, she unfollows you. 
When seeing with other people, the person acted like she didn’t know me . 

There were more instances with other girls (mostly friends of friends or partner but occasionally randomly) where they asked for my instagram, or they are inviting me to always talk to them, share things (what is your make up routine, what is your music) and I also ask questions to them, but when I actually do reach , they react in a way that makes a little confused - such as leaving  you on read for several days (they always have their phone with them). 
They would say things like let’s have a coffee or how excited they are to do x or y together but then when it comes to that, there is no engagement at all, or make me feel like “who are you?”.

Some other occasion, (coworkers and friends of partner) would watch all my stories and take pictures together, but then make fun to my partner about how I look, won’t talk to me directly if I don’t say sth first. I sat with a girl in the car where she wouldn’t say anything first at me, only if I initiated and then she would act very lively but then instead of continuing conversation just drop it, even if answer back. 
We literally at the end sat for 20 painful minutes silent in the car, because I just got too tired always asking and restarting conversation. 

Those situations where I’m not sure if I’m being made fun of or not. In any case, I feel bad about myself and feel ashamed for wanting to make even one friend. I feel like I must be so unlikeable or stupid. I feel more lonely for trying to be appreciate of making friends than to just to be on my own. 

The people I meet speak very good English, usually from work, and at first they’re happy to see me and engaged. But if I send a message, they don’t respond. I don’t do it twice because I respect people’s distance and don’t want to be pushy . But That makes me hesitate to invite someone for coffee, and I end up feeling like it must be me. It’s a bad feeling.

I keep wondering if this is about me, or about cultural differences (I’m European). 

Just for context: 

I’m not afraid of being alone.
I usually spend most of my time alone aside from family but I wish I could make some female friends here.

Are there things I should know, or certain ways to approach friendship in Türkiye?

To be clear, I don’t like stereotypes and I’m speaking only from my own experience. Whenever I face difficulties, I first question myself before blaming others.

I just started Turkish at a language school last month, before that I picked up bits and pieces from my in-laws. I can understand a little when listening, but I can barely speak yet.

I also tend to value deeper conversations over small talk. I was raised with long discussions about books, films, philosophy, life experiences, and global issues. For me, friendship isn’t a fleeting or superficial thing, invest in it sincerely. My partner sometimes says I share too much, and people don’t want to care others, but I enjoy to connect over good talks with a coffee some times, im only human too and having one or few female friends in a foreign country, is nice :). 

When I posted in another Reddit about this (post got removed) I was told maybe because I’m from Europe. But I grew up in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Korea, and I do  include my first culture in conversations, since Korea and Türkiye share a lot. I’m not having an entitled or spoiled attitude. I share whatever I have, even when I have very little, and I try to be respectful and modest. I don’t complain, (aside of Reddit post here, I don’t bring this up to anywhere) I listen.

 I just hope to sometimes enjoy a walk or a coffee with a girl friend in a foreign country :)

I was told few times by some people that it’s because there is a lot of competitiveness ? I understand competitiveness as in Korea is the same, if not harsher. But for me, that was never a reason not to bond. It could even be something to connect over with mutual understanding.

1nqw5j4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DexterNewBlood/comments/1nqw5j4/i_am_the_back_porch_pisser/,I am the Back Porch Pisser,"The porch boards creak like confession. The night is quiet enough to hear the weight of my own heartbeat. I step outside, unzip, and feel the cold air wrap around me like an accomplice. No middleman. No container. Just me, the stream, and the earth.

This is my ritual. My Dark Passenger doesn’t crave blood or chaos — he craves release, precision, a strange justice only the lawn can understand. The world thinks of waste as waste. I know better. Nitrogen, potassium, trace minerals… fertilizer disguised as sin.

The Code is simple: never on sidewalks, never on walls, never where a neighbor might stumble into my truth. Always direct-to-soil. Always feeding, never scarring. The grass receives me without question, drinking what I give it, greening by spring as silent testimony.

Winter complicates the act. Steam curls upward, a glowing signature in the cold. Snow remembers. A yellow arc etched into a white canvas feels like writing my name across the silence. Still, the Code demands I persist. To stop would be to deny the Passenger.

Some nights I linger, watching the patch I’ve chosen, imagining roots whispering in gratitude. Other nights it’s surgical — unzip, stream, vanish. No jug to betray me, no evidence to carry. The act begins and ends here, evaporated into soil and stars.

Neighbors might joke about the “mystery green spots” on the lawn come spring. The landlord might praise himself for a suddenly healthier yard. They’ll never know it was me — the Back Porch Pisser, the midnight gardener, the vigilante no suburb asked for.

I don’t do it for recognition. I don’t do it for rebellion. I do it because the Passenger insists, and because the grass deserves a caretaker who works in shadows. My stream is my blade, my porch is my table, and the soil… my witness.

And when dawn comes, the world resets. I make coffee. I live my daylight life. No one suspects that justice was served under moonlight, drop by drop.",3,1758876335.0,DexterNewBlood,5,1.0,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1758875437.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False
1nqvx99,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrademarkIP/comments/1nqvx99/a_concise_guide_to_global_trademarks_avoid/,【A concise guide to global trademarks: avoid pitfalls in 3 minutes】,"A trademark is a ""regional passport"" for a brand, and there is no single certificate that can be used globally. China does not recognize international fame, only looking at local registrations. The United States emphasizes ""first-to-use"", while the European Union has one trademark covering 27 countries. Understanding these three core points can help avoid 90% of pitfalls.

1. 3 understandings about life and death (to be remembered in 10 seconds)

According to the map of protection scope, trademarks registered in China are helpless against unauthorized use on American streets; the Madrid system covers 122 countries (with Brazil and Canada added in 2025), but South Africa and the United Arab Emirates still require separate registrations.

Registration logic transcends national boundaries: China adopts the ""first-to-file"" principle (whoever files first owns the rights), the United States adheres to the ""first-to-use"" principle (requiring evidence of first use, such as screenshots of e-commerce pages), and the European Union allows for ""one trademark for multiple classes"" (covering 27 countries at once).

https://preview.redd.it/yyq592plzgrf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5dc0631d696f49517a7f7aa936e168416a336faf

Maintenance is more difficult than registration: trademarks are valid for 10 years (in the United States, proof of use is required every 10 years), while in Australia, if a trademark   
is not used for 5 consecutive years, it will be revoked, and late renewal is equivalent to reapplication.

II. 3 registration paths (avoiding invalid actions)

① Madrid system (initial layout in multiple countries)

Operation: Obtain a domestic trademark as a base, then submit one application through WIPO, designating 122 countries (such as China→EU + Southeast Asia). The cost is 40% lower than that for individual countries (with a basic fee of approximately 653 Swiss francs).

Suitable for: limited budget, testing the waters in non-core markets (such as using Madrid Rapid to prevent European counterfeiting of G7 coffee in Vietnam).

Pitfall: If a domestic trademark is revoked within 5 years, the international registration will become invalid simultaneously (the ""central crackdown"" principle).

② Regional registration (deeply cultivating key markets)

EU trademark: one application, 27 countries, unified examination (e.g., a French brand can obtain the certificate within 2 months, covering the whole Europe);

Organization for African Intellectual Property (OAPI): Common to 17 French-speaking countries, with an indivisible registration (suitable for the West African market).

Suitable for: deep cultivation in targeted regions, avoiding repeated applications in a single country.

③ Single country registration (core market survival)

Mandatory for the United States, China, and Japan: For the United States, ""proof of use"" is required (such as screenshots of the official website with a purchase button). For China, ""local registration"" is recognized (Too Faced was forced to withdraw from China due to failure to register ""Twoface"" in advance, resulting in a loss of 1 billion yuan).

Suitable for: Countries where the product is primarily sold, and regions where disputes are prevalent (such as Kiehl's being forced to rename and reshape its brand due to not registering ""Kiehl's"").

III. 3 Iron Rules for Avoiding Pitfalls (Summarized with Blood and Tears)

✓ Don't trust ""Global Access"": Madrid does not cover South Africa and Myanmar, and for Southeast Asia, additional attention should be paid to Indonesia (a freight forwarder in a certain country lost 5 million due to not registering separately for Indonesia).

✓ Registration ≠ protection: The rejection rate in the United States exceeds 30% (common reason: lack of distinctiveness), while the opposition period in China is only 3 months (Too Faced missed the opportunity to protect its rights because it did not register before opening a store on Tmall).

✓ Renewal ≠ Lying Dormant: In Australia, the ""cancellation for non-use"" rate is 25% (trademarks are preemptively registered if not used for five consecutive years). In Japan, if the renewal is overdue within six months, it can be remedied; if overdue beyond that time, the application process must be restarted.

IV. Record of Foreign Brands' Mishaps in China (Too Faced)

In 2020, Too Faced, a brand under Estée Lauder, opened a store on Tmall, focusing on ""European and American mixed-race makeup"", but did not register a Chinese trademark. After being sued by the local brand ""Twoface"", the court ruled that:

Character trap: Too Faced and Twoface differ by only one letter, which can easily lead to confusion among consumers;

Chinese rules: No recognition of VOGUE's overseas exposure, only ""domestic registration time"" (which needs to be earlier than the first transaction on Tmall) is considered.

Outcome: The store closed in 2022, and by 2025, it had completely withdrawn from China, incurring direct losses exceeding 1 billion yuan. The reputation of an international big name ultimately succumbed to a local registration certificate.

V. 3-step survival strategy for enterprises

""Market remains unchanged, trademark goes first: Wherever the product is sold, the trademark should be registered first (with priority given to China, the United States, and Europe, with a focus on Brazil and India in 2025)."".

Combined approach to cost reduction: Madrid covers multiple countries (surface) + single-country registration for core markets (point), for example: China → EU (Madrid) + USA (single-country defense ""prior use"").

Keep an eye on new logos: In the era of e-commerce, dynamic icons (Tiktok notes) and sounds (Alipay payment received sound effects) are prone to being preemptively registered. Planning ahead can save 80% of the cost for rights protection.

Conclusion: The essence of global trademarking is ""regional offensive and defensive strategies"". The lesson from Too Faced proves that in markets with varying rules, there is no ""one-size-fits-all shield"", only ""precise spear"" - using the minimum registration fees to protect the core market is the survival principle for brands expanding overseas.",1,1758875428.0,TrademarkIP,0,1.0,False

I tried the Minipressos & Nanopressos (mechanical failures), French presses (too many grounds) and each have been suboptimal to bring along. So, now onto the OXO. 

I have to admit that after reading this sub for a few days, I feel like I'm suddenly in the deep end of the pool. 

I'm trying to understand the mechanics of getting something optimal out of the brewer without being a full-bodied espressologist. So far out of this thing I've had one really wonderful, fruity coffee, one intensely strong brew that blew my head off, and a pair of pleasant iced coffees. Really inconsistent but interesting so I'm excited to understand what's the best grind, and method for a stable, consistent coffee in a hotel room. 

I think I ground the beans too fine the first time, so there were only a few drops in the catch cup the first time, but it was hard to pump. Then the subsequent grinds were more coarse, somewhere between very fine and fine, and it's better but should I expect to see 1/5th of the catchup full from gravity in the 2 minute brewtime? 

I just don't understand what kind of grind to use and what to expect in the brew process. Can anyone point me in the right direction?",3,1758875343.0,OXORapidBrewer,2,1.0,False

Which is preferable to YOU, the person whose heart is good but whose actions harm, or the one whose heart is corrupt but whose actions benefit others — even if it’s involuntary or forced?

Like the worker who’s pushed to perform and ends up delivering results, vs the one who genuinely wants to do well but can’t get anything done.

Like the kid who helps his parents financially just to avoid shame, vs the kid who actually wants to help but doesn’t have the means.

Like the guy who steps in to stop bullying only to look good, vs the guy who bullies because he can’t resist the pressure to join in.

Would you rather marry a person who hates you internally but never shows it (gives you gifts and bla bla bla) or loves you internally but never shows it (hits you and pours moderate amounts of rat poison in your coffee)

The guy who gives charity cause he has a conscience even though in his heart he believes it to be a waste of money and would rather buy something of value, still does good but his own logical reasoning is against it vs someone who doesn't give charity cause he doesn't have the means to do so, instead he steals from the poor.

Did a pretty bad job of phrasing the question, I don't claim to be a literary expert, just a guy with too much time if his hands that he would not do anything actually productive with. So feel free to interpret the question however you want.

Notice though how I said morally preferable to YOU and not to Islam, preach elsewhere please this is just me wanting to waste time with bs. Deep thoughts with the deep.

I’m currently working on a startup project in Panglao and I’d love to share the concept, get feedback, and connect with people who might be interested in collaborating or investing :)

Currently, the area is filled with scattered pop-up food trucks and stalls along the streets. While demand for diverse food options is high, there is no organized, centralized venue that offers both vendors and customers a safer, cleaner, and more enjoyable dining experience.

Value Proposition:
•For customers: A one stop destination with a mix of food vendors, entertainment, and a comfortable space to dine and socialize.
•For vendors: Affordable stalls with steady foot traffic, shared utilities, and better visibility compared to independent roadside setups.
•For the community: Improved organization of local food businesses, reduction of street congestion, and added value to Panglao’s growing tourism economy.

Business Model:
•Stall Rental Fees: Vendors pay a fixed monthly rental fee.
•Commission Model: Option to add a 5–10% sales commission to maximize returns.
•Beverage Monopoly: All drinks (soft drinks, beer, cocktails, coffee) are sold exclusively by the hub for higher profit margins.
•Events: Venue rental for live music nights, festivals, and private functions.

 Market Opportunity
•Panglao hosted over 600,000+ tourists in 2024, with strong growth expected through 2025.
•The current food scene is dominated by unorganized pop-ups and roadside stalls. Tourists want variety and atmosphere, while locals want affordability.
•A centralized food park provides both, creating a sustainable tourism + community anchor.

Business Model & Revenue Streams
•Stall Rentals: 10–12 stalls @ ₱30,000/month = ₱300,000–₱360,000
•Commission on Sales: 5–10% optional cut = ₱50,000–₱80,000
•Beverage Monopoly (drinks, beer, cocktails, coffee): ₱100,000–₱150,000
•Events/Functions (weekend gigs, private rentals): ₱50,000–₱80,000

-Projected Monthly Gross: ₱500,000–₱650,000
-Operating Expenses (staff, utilities, marketing, maintenance): ₱150,000–₱180,000
-Projected Net Profit: ₱350,000–₱470,000

Capital Requirements
•Renovation, fit-out & stalls: ₱1.2M–₱1.5M
•Furniture & common areas: ₱300k–₱500k
•Kitchen provisions & shared utilities: ₱200k–₱300k
•Lighting, sound system, ambience: ₱200k
•Permits, working capital & contingency: ₱300k

~ Estimated Startup Investment: ₱2.2M–₱2.5M

ROI & Payback Period:
Net Monthly Profit: ₱350k–₱470k
Annual Net Profit: ₱4.2M–₱5.6M
ROI: 170–220% annually
Payback Period: 7–9 months

Competitive Advantage:
•First centralized food hub in Panglao
•Combines local affordability + tourist appeal
•Multiple income streams (not just rent) = higher stability
•Scalability: The model can be replicated in other high-tourism cities",1,1758875251.0,Investors,1,1.0,False

These aren’t “skip your daily coffee” type tips — they’re actually actionable things you can do this month to build momentum.

Break It Down + Automate

* Big numbers feel overwhelming (e.g., “I need $10K”).
* Break it into smaller, weekly amounts (e.g., $193/week for 12 months).
* Set up an automatic transfer right after payday so you’re “paying yourself first.”

Revisit Your Top 3 Expenses

* The biggest spending categories for most people are housing, transportation, and food.
* Renegotiate rent, cut unused car insurance extras, or swap commute methods.
* Even small wins here compound fast since they hit your largest costs.

Ask 2 Questions Before You Buy

* Do I really need this?
* If yes, how can I get it cheaper? (Comparison sites, secondhand, sales, etc.) This simple pause can redirect hundreds back into savings.

Tackle Debt First

* High-interest debt eats more than you can make in a savings account.
* Example: $5K at 18% costs $900/year in interest vs. $200 earned at 4% savings.
* Pay down debt → then build savings, so compound interest isn’t working against you.

Use the “Think, Want, Do” Framework

* Think = what you believe you spend
* Want = what you’d like to spend
* Do = what you actually spend Compare all 3 across categories (needs, wants, future savings). Redirect excess from “fun” into “future” without cutting all enjoyment.

Focus on the Other Side: Earn More

* There’s a cap on how much you can cut, but not on how much you can earn.
* Options: negotiate salary, switch jobs, freelance, side hustles, or sell unused items.

Put these together, and you’ll build savings habits that stick while freeing up cash you didn’t realize was slipping away.",2,1758875093.0,PersonalFinanceTalks,0,1.0,False

I’ve been working on a story that isn’t just romance, and isn’t just about grief either... it’s both, and everything tangled between.

The novel follows a girl trying to find her voice again after loss. Around her are people who both save and sabotage her: a boy who feels like both safety and ruin, a brother carrying wounds of his own, and a friend who talks too much but never leaves her side.

The world is very much alive in my head — nights by the harbour that hum with music, stables and rodeos heavy with dust and sweat, kitchens where secrets spill out over mugs of coffee, and bars where the air feels charged with everything unsaid.

It’s not an easy love story. It’s messy, raw, and full of conflict. But it’s also about the quiet redemptions, the way light still finds its way into dark places, the way even fractured people can carry each other through.

I didn’t write it to chase numbers. I wrote it because I needed to, and because I believe in the characters enough to think they might find someone else too.

If you like stories that feel cinematic, with themes of identity, friendship, grief, and slow-burn romance set against betrayal and self-destruction, this might be something for you.

I am looking for a book, which I read in 2008-09:

\- contemporary story (probably set in the 90s or 2000s. It definitely was not great literature ( My English wasn't great at the time).

\- 3 sisters (maybe cousins) who receive a yearly allowance (about a million) from their rich uncle

\- 2 of them are socialite, the other works but collects (bad) art with her money

\- One day the uncle introduce them to his fiancee/gf. There is a scene where one of the sis/cousins notices the ring on the gf's finger, and ask if it is a ruby. It is in fact a red diamond, and one of the sis/cousins thinks how that rink is worth more than their combined worth.

\- The uncle cuts them off, forcing them to reconsider their lifestyles. (there is a 'heartbreaking' scene when they finish the last of their blue mountain coffee, and remark that they will have to drink instant from now on). 

\- They try to start different ventures. The 'art collecting' one opens a women's networking club, and hire her hairdresser (or salon receptionist?) as her manager.

\- Towards the end of the book, the uncle meets them to try to convince them to join him or something, they refuse, he has a heart attack, they inherit his fortune.



Now the details I am not so sure about:

\- Whether it is a full novel or a shorter story.

\- I think it was set in London

\- I remember the cover to be a green stiletto heel. I thought it could have been a story by Lauren Weisberger (same style), but I cannot find it. Maybe I was mistaken and read that story at the same time.

Hi folks!

Long time coffee fanatic and a 4 month Dual Boiler owner. Before this I owned a Barista Express eventually with a df54 and before that a kitchenaid espresso machine and grinder. 

So now my setup is the DF54 with the European (Sage)version of the BES920 (SES920).
I bought it as a refurbished device from the official service center with one year of warranty for roughly 500 eur. 

I made my shots on the Express mostly light roast 18grams in a bottomless portafilter and got it perfect to my taste.

First shots I was making I used the standard portafilter and basket but I noticed my puck screens would warp.  First I thought there’s too much volume in the basket, but when I tried the razor tool there was even a 0.5 cm gap. Then after a few days and starting to tinker I found out they screwed the plastic shower head thingy the wrong way round causing it to protrude into the puck.

So I redid that and got pretty decent extractions on the standard portafilter.

I bought a new 58mm bottomless portafilter from Ali which seemed to be e61 or something, at least the grabbing ears were too thick.(even tho it said for bes920)
Bought a new one, which did fit, albeit this one seems to be a bit too narrow but twists on pretty good.

First thing I noticed:
I bought some precision baskets /deep extraction baskets varying 20 and 18 grams . From mhw3, alikisscafe and binco 

All these basket have an indent, because there’s a metal strip inside the portafilter that the basket clicks in to I guess.
 
Are there other systems? 

I now have my calibrated tamper sometimes grab on these indents and cause the puck to be slanted.

But more importantly, after tamping a 18gram basket there’s so much headroom. 
It seems too much.

Furthermore I can’t get the same extraction spread and viscosity as I did with my barista express.

I’ve been experimenting with 4 baskets, 2 bottomless portafilters and tried to measure based on weight and volume. 

I just can’t get a good extraction with these baskets and the portafilter.

I’ve been an avid coffee maker for 10 years.
I WDT, tamp and grind rather consistent, but I’ve never gotten such inconsistent results.

Are my AliExpress portafilters just crap?
Are Ali express baskets crap?
Because I read plenty positive about the baskets.

I’m almost starting to wonder if there’s issues with the machine. I also redid the grouphead rubber and replaced the plastic block with a metal one, but that just made everything fit worse.
Then changed it back to the original, and I still get the feeling the portafilter doesn’t fit the same way since.

If anyone is able to point me in the right direction help would be appreciated. 

One of my favorite hobbies now turned into frustration hoping my coffee will be nice in the morning. 
That’s not what I signed up for 😅

I will make a video with my process soon! This makes it more tangible perhaps.

However, it still feels like women just don't respect me or reciprocate interest. I walked up to 5 girls this year and got their numbers. Still, they stop texting me back eventually and ghost me; they won't let me take them out to a cafe to get coffee or tea and talk. It is so hard being in the U.S.; these girls don't communicate. I ask them why they are not interested, and they won't tell me. Be honest, what is it? Is it the way I look?",0,1758874504.0,LooksmaxingAdvice,3,0.5,False

You were the world that revolved around me with no shame in my game. My puppy eyes and following you like a lost child.

Hanging out after hours playing card games getting to know each other while other saw the puppy love we thought the world was ignorant to.

My love is a sexual one and a giving one. The one I want to share my life with is someone I want to wake up to the best alarm clock ever followed by breakfast in bed. Crisp clean sheets and the sun shining. Animals climbing on us and coffee spilled on us just to lock it off.

Pleasing you was my sacred place and I didnt want to share you with anyone. Fearful like a child you would be taken away from me like everything else I lost due to my own lack of self worth overcompensating with the cringe of trying to be someone I was never meant to be.

Fighting battles that stole years from my life and the love in my heart.

Going down on you was the most satisfying and giving satisfaction in a life where I had very little to offer where you were the bridge from hell to heaven.

That bridge has been burned and I’m left with words that can only transcend to places I wish I could have shared with you.

Today once again my head is in the Guillotine scarifying everything I had that once pleased you.

I love you and will forever fight for you because it’s you I want my head to always have to lay on you.

This time I won’t give up or give in. Every time we lost each other we always came back stronger.

Thank you for standing your ground this time not allowing the push and pull that once defined my perception of you.

Never truly knowing if it was the chase between me and you.

But now I know if I make it out alive this one last time life defining moment will be for both of us and everyone that defines you.

My head and heart has finally find each other and it’s all because of you.

I’ll never stop or forget to go down on you.",3,1758874495.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False
