Thanks for your comments on my first post (to anyone who didn't read it, you can go to my profile and read it from there!)
This all happened a year ago and now it came back all over again because of a conversation between my friends where I jokingly said that my teacher might have groomed me. 

I forgot to mention something on my last post.
My teacher wrote me a message this august because he remembered something personal I told him (something about a bet between me and my dad regarding spring and the blooming of flowers).

I was in a terrible mental state back then so I didn't answer his message as I would like now, but it was great to know that he remembered about it.

Now to the present, about two to three weeks ago I sent him a message, casually, and I invited him to a coffee.

The real motive of this meeting was to know if he had second intentions with me (if he had, then I would notice inmediatly, or he would have done something).

However, the meeting went well. He was such a sweetheart, once again, as always. We talked about our lives, I got to know him more outside our roles of teacher-student, but I still give him the treatment of my teacher, so the asymmetrical roles are still present in our dynamic. 

It should have stopped it right there.
There is something I haven't told y'all yet. And it's that I'm having a relationship with someone else right now.
We're like five months into dating (nothing official) but we're still exclusive to each other.

Seeing him again has given me wishes of marrying and being a mother, things that I will never do with my current date (because she doesn't believe in marriage). 

I have told my new psychologist about this and she just confronted me about how I am feeling. About how there is a pattern that repeats. I even made this man a playlist trying to express my feelings because music is my best way to do it.


Today I had a conference at the uni where my teacher also works at. I wrote him a message asking if by any chance he would be there, and bought cinnamon rolls thinking of him. Even though I lost hope of seeing him because he never answered until I was sitting at the conference, I later got out only to see him even if it was for five minutes. It made me happy to see him for those minutes. I handed him a cinnamon roll and he was so happy and said that he was very rewarded by me. 

I accompanied him back to the office and I waited for him until he came out of a meeting, where he told me to follow him. On the way to his car we kept talking about us.

He told me before parting ways that we should meet during the summer. That I should go visit him at the university where he is working (where we met today).

After that, I felt that he knew, somehow, what I felt for him. He would be so dumb if he didn't notice, because I'm literally at his feet. 

My feelings are probably one sided.
I don't want to ruin what I have with this girl.
But I'm slowly losing my head.

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen, which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

1pdlwye,https://i.redd.it/ujgrfqqx335g1.jpeg,Realtor Social Media: Trends Shaping Digital Property Marketing,"# How Social Media Is Evolving for Real Estate Professionals

The real estate industry has always followed consumer behavior, and consumer behavior now lives on social platforms. New formats, smarter algorithms, and tighter data integrations are redefining how agents, brokers, and property managers present listings and nurture relationships.

## AI-Driven Targeting Takes Center Stage

Artificial intelligence already powers many ad platforms, but recent upgrades let agents run highly precise, always-learning campaigns at modest budgets.

* Audience segments update in near real time as the system detects intent signals such as mortgage searches or job-relocation posts.
* Predictive models estimate how likely each user is to complete a showing request or inquiry form, automatically raising bids on high-value prospects and lowering spend elsewhere.
* AI copy and creative tools generate multiple caption and image variations, testing them against each micro-audience until engagement plateaus.

The result is less wasted spend and a measurable lift in qualified leads compared with static demographic targeting.

## Short-Form Video Becomes the Default Format

TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts have conditioned viewers to expect quick, vertical video. Properties filmed in bite-sized clips often outperform traditional photo carousels.

* Walk-throughs under 60 seconds highlight one standout feature—an oversized balcony, a smart kitchen, or a skyline view.
* Captions rely on conversational keywords (“two-bed in Midtown with parking”) that help both social search and voice assistants.
* Poll stickers, quick quizzes, and comment prompts invite engagement, which the platform then rewards with additional organic reach.

## Shoppable Posts Reduce Friction

Major platforms now allow direct inquiry buttons or lead forms inside the post. Potential buyers never leave the app to schedule a showing, request disclosures, or download a brochure.

* Facebook and Instagram’s native lead forms pre-fill user data, removing a key barrier to contact.
* Pinterest’s product tagging feature supports “Schedule a Tour” calls next to image pins.
* Early tests indicate lower abandonment rates than traditional website forms because the environment feels familiar and trusted.

## Social Signals Fold Into Search Engine Optimization

Google’s ranking algorithms increasingly factor engagement metrics from social channels. When a post linked to a listing page receives high dwell time, shares, or comments, the related page often sees a small—but noticeable—lift in search visibility.

* Optimized posting times concentrate reactions in the first hour, a signal both social and search algorithms treat favorably.
* Consistent brand mentions across Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram build a diversified backlink profile without formal outreach.
* Neighborhood-specific hashtags act like micro-keywords, making geo-targeted content easier to surface in local search results.

## Interactive Experiences Lengthen Attention Spans

Static photos no longer satisfy many tech-savvy prospects. Tools that encourage exploration keep viewers engaged and bolster both trust and excitement.

* 3D floor plans embedded in Stories let users rotate and zoom inside the app.
* VR live streams of open houses let remote buyers feel present, even from another state or country.
* Drone footage stitched into quick loops highlights the property’s setting—tree lines, nearby parks, or downtown proximity—better than ground-level shots alone.

## Data Integration Strengthens Relationship Management

Social media activity does not exist in a vacuum. Modern customer relationship management (CRM) platforms sync comments, direct messages, and reactions, giving agents a holistic view of each contact.

* Sentiment analysis flags negative or urgent comments for immediate follow-up.
* Chatbots answer common questions after hours, and the conversation transcript feeds back into the CRM.
* Transaction history, saved searches, and interaction timelines guide more personalized outreach, reducing generic drip campaigns.

## Hyperlocal Positioning Builds Authority

National trends matter, but most buyers still care most about the neighborhood. Hyperlocal strategy tailors content to that scale.

* Geo-targeted ads on Facebook or Nextdoor surface only to users within a set radius, saving budget.
* Local influencer partnerships—think neighborhood food bloggers or school-district parents—lend third-party credibility.
* Posts showcasing community events, new coffee shops, or park renovations position the agent as a local resource, not just a salesperson.

## Authenticity Remains the Trust Anchor

Algorithms may favor high production quality, yet viewers increasingly prefer real voices to polished promos.

* User-generated videos—clients filming their move-in day or explaining why they chose the area—outperform scripted testimonials.
* Behind-the-scenes clips of staging, inspection, or renovation planning remind followers that real estate involves real work.
* Agents who appear on camera with casual commentary humanize the process, encouraging direct messages over formal inquiry forms.

## Voice Search Optimization Gains Ground

Smart speakers and in-car assistants funnel more property questions than ever. Voice queries differ from typed keywords, often phrased in full sentences (“Find a three-bedroom near Elmwood Park under 500K”).

* Social captions mirror these conversational patterns, enhancing discoverability when search engines scrape public posts.
* FAQs repurposed as short audio clips or Story slides meet voice-search expectations while doubling as social content.

## Security and Transparency Advances

Blockchain verification tools, while still niche, offer tamper-proof records of listing details and transaction milestones. Sharing these certificates in Stories or Highlights may counter growing concerns about fraudulent listings.

## Outlook for the Next Five Years

1. More platforms will merge listing feeds with embedded mortgage calculators and closing-cost estimators.
2. Augmented reality overlays will let users point a phone at a building to reveal current listings, historical sales, or neighborhood data.
3. Regulatory scrutiny on ad targeting will tighten. Expect broader use of anonymized, consent-based data sets.
4. Social platforms will continue to celebrate microcommunities, favoring agents who specialize in niche property types or lifestyle segments.

### Key Takeaways

* AI targeting and predictive analytics reduce spend while increasing lead quality.
* Short-form video dominates attention spans; authenticity beats polish.
* Social engagement now influences traditional SEO metrics, linking the two disciplines.
* Integrated data and hyperlocal content foster stronger, trust-based relationships.

Realtors who adapt to these shifts early position themselves for greater visibility, smoother client journeys, and steadier pipelines as the digital landscape matures.

I usually clock in, sit at my desk for about 30 minutes. On the bus ride to work, I try to hype myself up. I try to envision the myriad of tasks I need to do/catch up on. I set goals for myself. ""Okay, when you clock in, you're going to pour your coffee and you'll start on that one project by the time you finish the cup."" Then it becomes 8:30 am. ""Well, what's another 30 minutes?"" I take a walk around the building. Sometimes there's snacks in one wing in particular so I always hit that one up first.

No snacks this week, damn. Oh well. ""Okay, after you finish your water, you HAVE to start on that project. At the very least, answer that one email about a status update.""

30 minutes roll by, and nada.

I hate my job. It's so monotonous. It pays shit. There's 0 upward mobility unless I want to be a manager (which, let's be real, I can't even manage myself, plus the current manager's been there for 20 years and she isn't leaving anytime soon). It also required a master's degree. I literally feel like my brain is turning to mush working there. It's the least intellectually stimulating job I've ever had and makes me question wtf the point was about having the degree. I had to literally teach myself the job and have used nothing I learned in school here.

This week, I have touched exactly 0 projects. Last week was the same. I literally haven't done anything but waste company time for the last several weeks. Part of me kind of wishes somebody would notice so they can fire me so I can actually feel motivated to find something else.

I've been in this pattern for about a year now. And somehow, miraculously, I can manage to submit a passable project in the minutes before a deadline. But it's all starting to catch up now. I've put off too many projects and assignments. They're all small, but it's starting to snowball and I can feel a potential chew-out by early next year.

When I was younger, the young me would have thought ""Wow cool, a job that pays you to do nothing!"" But honestly this is awful. I feel 0 connection to my work and I reap no benefits. There's no tangible sense of achievement. I literally stare at fucking spreadsheets all day and move my mouse every 15 minutes to make sure my laptop doesn't fall asleep.

Some days I think about just not showing up to see if my boss even notices.",2,1764809169.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

Okay, so, I posted on here about a guy I like but I wasn’t so sure if he was into me or not. 

We live in different states and met on a trip I did to his city to visit some mutual friends, we text a lot, he is very cool and stylish and attractive in my opinion(debatable if he is conventionally attractive or not). He is a graphic designer, coffee shop co-owner and social media manager and photographer. Very creative person. 

A little while after we met my parents went to his city and he sent me some expensive Japanese matcha cause I mentioned I love matcha. Big gesture, right? I think so… but still, no talks about our feelings and stuff. For context, we are 26F and 28M. 

Then we had a bit of an argument about modern dating and he told me that women who think like me end up alone in their 30s… so uncalled for, but okay. We stopped talking every day after that argument. I didn’t argue or snap back, I simply excused myself and didn’t reach out again. But he reached out again after a few days, but he didn’t address the argument, and since then our communication is on and off, with him being the one to rekindle the conversation. 

We have an inside joke about a gossip podcast where we listen to people’s problems and we do it under the impression that we just want to pray for them. And a few days ago he made a comment about that inside joke and I was like… ""yeah, go ahead and do the logo, I have a minimalistic vibe""… cue to 3 hours later and he sends me an actual design of the logo. With me in the middle, he did an illustration of me. I look beautiful in it, he chose to draw me with my natural hair (curly) instead of my usual straightened/blowout hair. He chose colors I like and added a little coffee cup. Since we live in another state, I doubt he memorized my face, so he had to look for pictures, and in my feed all my pictures are with straight hair and only 3 with my natural curly hair. I am sure he got inspired from one of those 3 pictures. And then he also told me he can take pictures of me for the podcast… ""his treat""… he said. Now, I am not a graphic designer… so, is this a labor of love? Or do you randomly just do things like this for friends?

But then again, after our argument he silenced my stories in IG and hasn’t reactivated them since. But he talks to me, and he does this ""gestures"" (the matcha, the design, the pictures, the banter, following MY church on instagram, checking in on my parents while they were in his city)… but then nothing else. No talk about our feelings, nothing. No follow up. 

And we’ve been talking for 3 months at this point. Our mutual friends say he definitely seems to put in more effort for me than his usual way of being with women.

I started at 30mg and titrated up over about 4 months and now I’m on 50mg, currently on my second bottle at this dose.

I don’t feel any noticeable increase in energy, motivation, or focus. I don’t feel wired, I don’t experience a productivity boost, and I don’t have a crash. I also have no issues sleeping on it.

I still feel very scatterbrained. Like thinking of a million different things and all these problems and solitons etc…I also have a hard time sitting and focusing on one task.

Any changes I’ve noticed from Vyvanse are extremely subtle, almost like when I was taking Strattera a few months ago. For example I might notice I did something that I had been putting off for ages without much thought. But that seems pretty infrequent. Before I started Zepbound for weight loss, the only effect I noticed was feeling hungrier at night. Now the only changes I notice are that I scroll more and maybe my anxiety is slightly worse, although I also lowered my Zoloft dose by 12.5mg, so that could be part of it.

For anyone on Vyvanse:
	•	Does it actually make you feel a shift mentally?
	•	Does it help you initiate and complete tasks?
	•	Or is it supposed to be so subtle that you barely notice it?

I’m trying to figure out whether this is a dosage issue, a medication mismatch, or if this is just how it affects some people.

Thanks.

Should add: I don’t drink or do drugs, I still drink coffee every day, and as far as other supplements I take a mushroom complex, magnesium glycinate, and b complex (focus factor). Was taking l-tyrosine but ran out for about a month now. ",1,1764809056.0,VyvanseADHD,2,1.0,False

Sci-Fi, Comedy, Stream of Consciousness. 5,023 words.)

Perhaps it is selfish of me to tell the truth at this point. Perhaps all the legends and myths about me, no matter how unnecessarily flattering, serve their purpose. Alas, I am an old man now - an old man who wants to sit in the grass and tell a story.

You’ve probably heard some rumor or other, but honestly, it doesn’t matter who I was before that fateful day I went to Goodwill. I barely remember myself and care even less. What I do recollect from is having some loose time in my day to go to the local thrift store and browse their fantastic wares.

It is impossible to know what I was looking for. No one goes to a thrift store knowing what they’ll get, they just vaguely hope they’ll find something that’ll irrevocably change everything for the better forever. Luckily, that’s exactly what happened to me. I remember wandering the aisles perusing the various objects on display; a Mickey Mouse alarm clock with faded plastic, a VHS copy of “Homeward Bound: Revelations” repaired with duct tape, a child’s science fair project that could’ve been mine for the low, low price of seventeen dollars.

It is a testament to the power of The Correct Item that it would stand out amongst this embarrassment of riches. In my minds eye I remember it levitating there, bobbing and rotating in midair emanating a golden aura alongside a gentle, angelic harmony. Of course, as you all know, I am prone to my romantic revisionisms and flights of fancy; like most inanimate home goods, it was probably just sitting there on the shelf.

Regardless, I stumbled towards it arms outstretched, mouth agape, heart racing and refusing to believe the evidence of my eyes until I held The Correct Item in my hands. This was it! The one missing piece in my life that would forever change everything evermore. A masterful blend of form and function, The Correct Item offered a plethora of practical utility while evoking a design sensibility that all at once nodded towards the Classical and Baroque but at the same time seemed thoroughly modern, maybe even with a futuristic flair. It would be impossible not to admire it for its otherworldly beauty while engaging with its myriad of uses. And incredibly, it was only five dollars more than what I had valued it in my head.

The Correct Item fit perfectly into that little, awkward nook in my apartment where nothing else seemed to fit. And like the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle sliding into place, my whole apartment came into a singular focus upon its installation; a harmonious, unified bow with The Correct Item as the knot at the center.

The effects of The Correct Item were immediate. With it in my possession, I started waking up not just on time but at a time that allowed me the space before work to eat a healthy breakfast, read a little, and sit outside admiring the morning dew while enjoying a cup of coffee. At work, I suddenly had extraordinary ideas regarding customer satisfaction, project workflows, operational procedures, and even HR practices that would satisfy employees and management alike. My relationships flourished. I easily charmed and ingratiated myself amongst even the most prickly of strangers. Friendships that I had maintained since childhood that had seemingly plateaued all of sudden went a level deeper. The dead end relationship I was in was able to be resolved in a graceful and mature manner where we remained amicable and we even introduced each other to our subsequent partners. And not to mention I was better at sex than ever before, reaching #1 on the local leaderboards.

All were in awe when I had guests over. “Wherever did you get this!?” they would exclaim in amazement and I would chuckle in response, swirling my spaghetti martini in one hand, “Oh, I just picked it up somewhere. Unfortunately, they don’t make things like this anymore.” My guests would rush online, trying any avenue to purchase a Correct Item for themselves, but alas, they only encountered scam posts and cheap knockoffs that were either comically and uselessly small, or branded with the logos of pop punk bands we’re all too embarrassed to admit we liked at some point or another, or made with MDF treated with a chemical that caused migraines and was prone to spontaneous combustion. Years later, historians would discover the company that made The Correct Item went bankrupt after their warehouse containing their entire stock was swallowed by a sinkhole caused by a nearby fracking operation. They never bothered picking up the only surviving unit that was on display at a mall some 90 miles away.

Word spread about my marvelous possession. Friends and family would find any reason to drop by. Curious neighbors would ring my doorbell and sheepishly ask to see it. After excusing myself to the bathroom, I caught the local reverend, who had turned up demanding to see what his flock was buzzing about, giving The Correct Item a big kiss. A mother running for the PTA board requested to have a photo op with it. After a groundswell of support due to the photo she changed her slogan to “Samantha Scarlett - The CORRECT Choice.” She won in a landslide with a voter turnout that, up until that point, was record setting not just for the local level but statewide as well.

Over the years, people have asked me about this period of time, “Weren’t you concerned that people were using you just to get to The Correct Item?” Each time I would laugh heartily, slap my hand on their shoulder and give them a sympathetic, yet pitying, look. They didn’t get it! And perhaps you don’t either, so I will lay it all down here - the quality of goods you buy are a direct reflection of who you are as a person. And The Correct Item, with its rich mahogany inlays, sturdy construction, and comprehensive Bluetooth connectivity, was simply the best purchase anyone has ever made. People came to conflate, rightly so, the durability, beauty, and usefulness of The Correct Item with the richness of my moral character. Not to mention the fact that I bought it at a thrift shop showed a thorough comprehension of commercial, economic, and mercantile matters. As such, I started to become a leader of the community. People would come to me for advice regarding love and life, squabblers would show up seeking arbitration, politicians would come seeking guidance on their various policies and upcoming votes. And I was correct in all things.

I didn’t really quite grasp the influence my object and I exhibited until the night it was almost stolen from me. Certainly, you know the story - it is but one of the many myths and legends repeated to school children about me - but please, indulge an old man for a moment.

I remember the man. He had the unfortunate name of Alan Rickman, forever living in the shadow of someone he had nothing to do with but happened to share a name with. He was a friend of a friend of a friend and one day accompanied one of that train to my apartment. He stood agape in the presence of The Correct Item, never tearing his gaze away from it while his friends and I talked. As goodbyes were underway, he let out a desperate and meek, “Can I touch it?” His friends laughed at him and told him to stop being weird. I gave them a scornful look and then smiled benevolently, “Of course, you can.” He ran forward like a child and clasped the giant dial on the front of The Correct Item with both hands and twisted it, gasping and giggling with each resonant, metallic clang from the inner workings of the mechanism. After three turns of the dial, I sternly let him know that was enough. I was trying to be kind and was unaware the effect of such a privilege would have on him.

Later that night, Alan Rickman was caught scaling the side of my apartment building with a burlap sack containing a crowbar and a sledgehammer. It is hotly contested to this day whether he meant to steal The Correct Item or to destroy it. The people that caught him were a self-styled band of vigilantes calling themselves The Disciples of the Correct Item, and they had taken upon themselves to watch over me and my home. This was the first I’d ever heard of them. I suppose I should’ve been more aware of the sudden uptick of hooded figures sulking about my neighborhood but I chalked it up to flowing crimson robes with gold fringe being back in style again, fashion being cyclical and all that.

The Disciples quickly apprehended Alan Rickman, who was no master thief. As three of them wrestled the poor man to the ground, the rest started forming a makeshift podium out in the middle of the street of whatever they could find. A hot-wired RV made up the main platform and piled around it were various garbage cans, lawn ornaments, and pulled up shrubbery. The end result was less stage and more pyre.

Three Disciples stood atop the RV with a restrained Alan Rickman while the rest formed a semicircle around the base of the pyre, anonymous in their crimson, hooded robes. One on top of the stage blew a strange horn to summon the surrounding community. It sounded like the dying cry of a long gone creature. This is what woke me up and I assumed the same of everyone else - that everyone was coming out to investigate the strange sound. I was wrong about that.

For maybe the only time ever, I had to ignore the Morning Printout coming out of The Correct Item and rushed outside. A large crowd had accumulated around the RV and Disciples were whipping them into a fury.

“Thief!” Shouted some.

“Desecrator!” shouted others.

A man crawled onto some of the garbage cans in front of the crowd. He was well dressed and had a naturally commanding presence about him. The crowd hushed as he raised his arms.

“I’ve been a civil rights advocate my whole life. I’ve defended the rights of everyone and anyone to the fullest extent of my abilities. For I believed in the rights of all no matter the circumstances.” He gestured towards Alan Rickman. “I no longer believe in such things. We should cut off this guy’s hands.” The crowd roared and undulated with eager justice. Torches were being lit and handed out. An enterprising opportunist was selling t-shirts commemorating the event and the biggest man you’ve ever seen pushed his way to the front of the crowd, holding an equally enormous axe in both hands. He climbed to the top of the RV in three large bounds and his silhouette blotted out the morning sun as his thick, hairy arms raised his ax over a trembling Alan Rickman.

“Stop!” I cried out from the front door of my apartment building and another hush came over the crowd. I looked out over the sea of unwavering stares and stepped forth. The people parted before me as I made my way. I clumsily climbed on top of the garbage cans and patio furniture before scrambling onto the roof of the RV. “Release this man at once,” I said through heavy breaths, exhausted from my ascent.

The Lead Disciple faced towards me; lit torch held at an angle above her head. An unnatural darkness obscured her face and made it hard to see her expressions. The huge man, ax held high and trembling as if only held back by a hair trigger, stared at me through the slits in the black sack covering his head. A tense silence permeated the air.

“The Proprietor… has chosen… MERCY!” the lead hooded woman bellowed in a sickly rasp and the crowd once again erupted in pandemonium, this time in revelry and celebration. Alan Rickman was unshackled and he fell to my feet, crying and clutching my legs. I picked him up and embraced him, demonstrating how I regarded him as an equal. He wound up becoming one of my closest friends, confidants, and personal advisors.

But of course, you know who Alan Rickman was. He was the general I put in charge to lead the campaign to retake Eastern Europe during The Unbeliever Uprising.

Soon afterwards I asked the Disciples of The Correct Item to disband, mostly because of their strange, alarming, and completely unwarranted behavior. I tried to be polite about it but they still seemed pretty upset and embarrassed. I think it was all these guys really had going on.

A few years later, I saw that huge guy working at a pet store somewhere in Beaverton, Oregon (yes, the stories are true! There WAS a Beaverton, Oregon and it was every bit as magical as you were told and more! Shame about that asteroid, though). He was pretty easy to recognize due to his immense size and the fact that he was still wearing that sack over his head and the same black tunic cinched at the waist with a bloodstained, tattered rope. After a few awkward hey-so-good-to-see-yous, we chatted for a bit and caught each other up on our lives. He explained that times were rough ever since the market for cultish executioners had dried up and he was forced to find other work, although he was doing alright now. I commiserated and told him about how so incredibly busy I was ever since several democratic governments capitulated to my growing influence. Once the pleasantries were exchanged, I relayed my need for a “lil’ somethin’-somethin’” for Goldfish Fridays down at the roller rink and he was more than helpful in helping me find exactly what I was looking for.

“Hey,” he called out to me as I was leaving, one foot out the door. I turned and he continued, “Those were some good times, huh?”

He was probably talking about the event with the Disciples (in which case, I think he was being overly sentimental and sappy over something that was actually a troubling display of what happens when men don’t have hobbies and healthy, offline communities; also, the whole thing lasted, like, five minutes, tops) however overall there was a spirit of optimism and hopefulness that swept the world. As people heard of my messianic figure and the cool thing I bought at Goodwill, they took to the streets to beg their leaders to become part of my new world order. In a country once called The United States of America, an unremarkable nation disregarded by history, a nationwide ballot measure was cast to strip their government of power and hand it all to me. The result was nearly unilateral in my favor and when questioned, the naysayers were horrified to realize they were holding their ballots upside down and not only did they against me, they had voted “Yes” on the referendum to make all the birds louder. One by one, all the countries of the world followed suite. For the first time in history, all the guns fell silent, all the mouths were fed, and all of mankind was able to join hands and be united under a single banner in peace and harmony in the name of The Correct Item.

Except for the Unbeliever Uprising, I forgot about that. Fuck, that was a nasty affair. Thank god for Alan Rickman.

Under my leadership, Earth entered a worldwide golden age. I ruled with utmost fairness and kindness for the entire populace with The Correct Item at my side, its Goodwill price sticker still stuck on one of its various levers. On the rare occasion two factions would come at odds with each other, and the mere sight of The Correct Item wasn’t able to qualm their quarrels, I was able to present hidden third options that satiated all parties involved. Earth became one economy. All of the planet’s resources were allocated appropriately and technology advanced in leaps and bounds to the point it resembled what would’ve been called “magic” a mere ten years ago and the word “impossible” fell out of use in the common vernacular. As a result of this monumental progress, Earth was more than prepared for the Calcinthinoid Incursion.

A scientist at SETI had one day entered the rough dimensions of The Correct Item as the frequency bandwidth the gigantic dish was currently receiving and had picked up subspace chatter from an unknown source. The messages were spoken in their alien language, which really just sounded like English but as if bugs were speaking it.

“The puny Earthlings are no match for our might! They are ripe for harvesting!” said one voice.

“Prepare the fleet at once!” said another.

“No need to rush!” screeched a third, “There’s no force in the galaxy that’d unite a planet quickly enough to resist our forces! We can use this time to learn to play the instruments we always wanted but never got around to!”

“I don’t know, I always get a little sad thinking about learning an instrument at my age,” responded the second alien, interspersing the clauses with an animalistic chittering, “It makes me feel like I’ve squandered the neuroplasticity of my youth.”

“Listen, nothing can get back the time we’ve already spent, but as the saying goes - the best time to plant a xinblorp was twenty cycles ago; the second best time is now. Let’s just do what makes us happy in the here and now and then we can go crush the weakling humans!”

Of course, the Calcinthinoids were working off of outdated information and when the invasion force arrived, the hammer of their armada smashed against the anvil of our planetary defense forces. While the Calcinthinoids were watching tutorial videos and plucking along to rudimentary melodies, Earth built up a vast, interconnected network of Orbital Hypernuclear Missile Platforms and Automated Plasma Railgun Stations, all backed up with carrier dreadnoughts, each capable of deploying 10,000 fighter craft. All these planetary fortifications were centralized in the ionosphere above the apartment where I still lived with The Correct Item.

The battle, still unnamed as historians argue whether it should sound really cool or somber and important, lasted for three days. The soldiers of the Calcinthinoid Empire, having never known defeat, fought fiercely. But they had come up against something they’ve never encountered. Something unstoppable. Something impervious to any weapon. For in every human there lies a fundamental truth that they’re willing to fight and to die for. You know what it is. It’s what we all say every night before bed. It is what every mother whispers to their newborn infant. It is what all schoolchildren say as they pledge allegiance to the human race every morning. Say it with me now.

“Somewhere out there is an item available for purchase that will change my life for the better.”

You know, I shouldn’t have mandated that children pledge allegiance to the human race. That was a strange thing to do.

Did you know this battle is where the Rings of Earth come from? It’s true. In the years following the battle, all the debris coalesced in an orbit around the equator. It may look beautiful from the inner atmosphere, but if you were to take a stratopod to the edges of our atmosphere you’d see the aftermath of those terrible few days; remains of spaceships floating lifelessly, bodies drifting among unexploded and unstable ordnance rendered too unsafe to retrieve, endless amounts of Calcinthinoid equivalents of Squire brand guitars. It is a sobering sight. But it is a ring we wear proudly. For if you look at Earth from anywhere in known space, you can see us wearing the symbol of our galactic superiority.

Humanity chased the routed Calcinthinoid fleet all the way back to their homeworld (coincidentally also called “Earth,” but, you know, like a bug would say it). It was only a matter of hours between establishing orbital supremacy and our quantum marines raising the Earth flag above the bombed-out structure of the Theocractic World Parliament of Calcinthin. As it were, at the moment of death Calcinthinoids would telepathically transmit the last sight they would ever see to the rest of their kind. So heavy were their losses, the entire species was almost constantly bombarded with the image of The Correct Item, a silhouette of which was stenciled upon the tail fins of our interplanetary cruisers and fighter craft. By the time we had boots on the ground, large swaths of the Calcinthinoid population had defected from their hectocentennial theocratic hegemony and begged our troopers for any information about The Correct Item.

I designed the Earth flag, by the way. I chose to represent Earth with a picture of Earth I found on Google Images. Next to it is a picture of The Correct Item I took with my phone, with my apartment fully visible in the background as I never really learned how to mask items in Photoshop. Underneath both of these pictures is the word “Earth!” in a neat typeface I found on dafont.com.

Having defeated the predominant force in the galaxy, Earth was now known as the prevailing regional power and all the civilizations and planets that suffered under Calcinthinoid rule flocked to ingratiate themselves, offering tribute to myself and The Correct Item. My apartment became the nexus of all political and commercial activity in all the known galaxy, much to the dismay of my landlord who tried to argue that intergalactic dignitaries and their entourages violated the provisions in the lease that stipulate that guests can only stay 3 days and pets weren’t allowed. A judge found his complaints frivolous and took the time to state that the comments regarding pets was xenophobic towards the Bloogians, who looked and acted like golden retrievers wearing top hats. After he lost the lawsuit, my landlord swore that he’d never rent an apartment to an intergalactic emperor ever again.

Peace and prosperity reigned throughout the Milky Way for over a century. I could bore you with the ins and outs of this period and the responsibilities bestowed upon a man of my station - managing hyperspace trade routes, dictating which planetary systems belonged to which spacefaring consortium, unmasking myself as a surprise guest in televised singing competitions - but what is important in my story is that eventually my star started to fall.

I was invited to be a guest of honor at a science symposium on a planet called q’Lanthenurp (but, you know, like how a bug would say it). I’d been to many functions and had stopped caring about them long ago, but in recent years it seemed like the flow of prestigious invitations had been stymied. My closest advisors, at least the ones who remained after all this time, begged me not to go.

“Your excellency,” they cried, “There’s no need for you to attend such a lowly and dangerous event as a science symposium!” I gently held up a bony, weathered hand to silence them. It had been a while since I was invited anywhere. I didn’t even notice they didn’t ask for the presence of The Correct Item.

I was a bit shocked to be seated so far in the back, and with a pillar blocking any possible sight of the main stage. Seated next to me was a Loplolian eating a hot dog. I eyed it hungrily, realizing my travel schedule hadn’t allowed me the chance for a bite in quite a while, an unfair burden on a man my age; at that point the oldest human to have ever lived. I leaned towards the Loplolian and asked, “Hey bud, where’d you get the hot dog?” I forgot that Loplolians take their time in responding to any inquiry. A simple answer to “How are you?” might take one upwards of a week for it to consider all the possible angles of response. Its mouth hung agape and all four hands clasped the hot dog tightly as its brow furrowed in immense thought. Meanwhile, onstage, someone suggested a way to reverse the effects of that disastrous referendum all those years ago and make the birds quieter once again. Pandemonium erupted. In all the uproar, an older scientist stood and shouted, “That’s impossible!” but no one really understood what that meant. “Oh, save your archaic language for the emperor; he’s the only one who’d understand you, old man!” shouted a hot, young scientist wearing sunglasses and a lab coat with the sleeves torn off to reveal extraordinarily built arms. I was expecting a stunned hush to come over the crowd, but it seemed everyone had forgotten I was there.

“Hot dog stand out front,” said the Loplolian, finally taking a bite.

The symposium entered a recess when one scientist ran another through with a saber for suggesting the existence of Scondos, which no one actually knew what they were, but we all know how science symposiums can get. I brushed past the paramedics and riot police rushing in, who were muttering “Fucking scientists, every goddamn year.”

The hot dog stand was just outside the main doors. A long line stretched across the terrace, around a gigantic statue depicting a man in a lab coat defiantly chugging something from an Erlenmeyer flask while two other men try to stop him, and out across a nearby road impeding the flow of traffic. Desperately hungry, I thought that I might be able to abuse my position for once in my storied career and cut to the front of the line.

“Hey, hey, hey!” cried the hot dog broker in a thick New York accent, “Who do you think you are!?”

“I sincerely apologize, I’m the Sovereign Emperor of Planet Earth and Her Outlying Colonies, I just…”

The man cut me off, clapping sarcastic over his shoulder, “Oh! The emperor! Look, everybody, it’s the emperor of the friggin’ Earth!” He stopped clapping and shrugged aggressively at me, “What? You think that makes you better than everybody else!?”

“I try to not let it get to my head, I just -“

“Back of the line, bub.”

While I stood in line for two hours and forty-five minutes for my hot dog, I pondered the ephemeral and cyclical nature of things. Tides ebb and flow, mountains form and wind blows them away, laundry is washed, folded, worn, and then washed again.

When I got back to Earth, I made the proper arrangements and booked a stratopod to where I knew in my heart this journey would end. I wore simple robes so that anyone looking would assume I was nothing more than one of the few scattered hermits still living on the Earth’s surface. 

“Are you sure this is where you wanna get off?” asked the stratopod operator, her voice ripe with confusion and worry. I looked her up and down; judging by her age there was a distinct chance she had never stepped foot on Terra firma in her life. Smiling, I wished her a nice day and alighted onto the ground below. 

The stratopod lifted up and into the sky, zooming off to one of the arcologies in the sky, egg-shaped cities made from glassy, transparent aluminum panels held together by biomechanical vines. If one listened closely, they could hear the whir of the trillions of semi-organic blades of leaves and grasses working together as wings and rotors to keep the grand bastions of humanity afloat among the cumulonimbus clouds, but this sound could easily be mistaken for the wind. These sanctuaries dotted the horizon all across the world and they are where most of humanity had chosen to live. You are probably reading this story in one right now.

A great, grassy plain stretched before me, miles of emerald green grasses swaying in a soft breeze and surrounded by pristine blue mountains. A reclaimer drone whizzed past me at an astonishing velocity, looking for any last bits of rubble or ruin of the various roads, homes, strip malls, libraries, and prisons that used to dot this area; in the blink of an eye it was already almost to the horizon, leaving behind a windswept wake in it’s path and only stopping for a split second to reconstitute an old street sign into its base elements to be reused in the restoration of the environs of old. 

After taking in the view, I hoisted The Correct Item onto my back, surprisingly lightweight considering its size and sturdy appearance. While doing so, I accidentally activated a hidden LED panel that showed the current time and temperature.

“My god,” I chuckled to myself, “Even after all these years you continue to surprise me.” 

I made off towards the only structure still remaining and operational, to my knowledge, in this sector. It was a squat rectangle of a building with a beige stucco exterior, nestled comfortably in the exact center of this immense field. Large blue letters and the familiar logo acted as a beacon, guiding me towards my final goal.

I stepped into the Goodwill and a glassy-eyed, slack jawed teenager rudely told me that they were closing in fifteen minutes. After a brief back and forth where I argued that just because they were closing soon that didn’t mean they were closed now, the teen acquiesced and accepted my donation. I watched as he placed The Correct Item on the shelf in between a gently used Scondo and a ratking made up of nine shoelaces tied together. 

For the first time in a long while, I had nothing to do and nowhere to be. I went outside and sat in the grass, picking a blade and absentmindedly breaking it into halves until I picked a new one, all while staring out at the world I had created. I thought about what that murderer at the pet store said all those years ago.

Picture this: It’s June 2016, I’m on my honeymoon in southern Croatia, dodging shingly beaches and pine groves on the Korčula peninsula, camera in hand because… well, who wouldn’t? 
Fast-forward to now, and those sun-drenched shots of Orebić’s historical vibes and crystalline Mediterranean waves have finally escaped my hard drive and turned into a real-deal portfolio site. No more “someday” excuses for this Lower Saxony-based German photographer who’s equal parts web designer, history nerd, and eternal wanderer.

I built h3p.me to share the stories behind the pixels

	•	Croatian Scenes (Vol. 1 & 2): That honeymoon magic captured in timeless coastal horizons, rugged cliffs, and villages that feel like they stepped out of a postcard. (Pro tip: It’s the perfect spot for a day trip, just 2.5 km across the water from Korčula Town.)

	•	Color Worlds Book: My love letter to the “inconspicuous”—fleeting shadows on walls, colorful sand grains at your feet, sunlight piercing rain clouds over industrial plants. Abstract, moody, and a bit philosophical (because why not?).

	•	5K Sea Wallpaper Collection: Pure zen with turquoise-to-sapphire Mediterranean blues, gentle waves, and sunlight patterns that scream “meditative escape.” Grab one for your desktop and pretend you’re there.
	•	Midjourney Gallery: Yeah, I dipped my toes into AI-generated worlds too—guilty pleasure or future of the craft? You tell me.

	•	Plus black & white urban edges, adventure shots, and freebies on Unsplash if you’re just browsing.
And hey, I’m kicking off a travel-themed blog there too—first posts dropping soon on blending archaeology, history, and tech with my lens (because nothing says “vacation” like pondering ancient ruins at golden hour).

But here’s the challenge to make this fun (and keep me humble): Scroll my site for 10 seconds and bet you can spot my Achilles’ heel—the one recurring “Misses” I’ve wrestled with for years (hint: it’s in the curation). Nail it in the comments, and I’ll shout you out in my next blog post. Wrong? We’ll laugh about it over coffee (virtually).
What do you think, Reddit jury?

Sci-Fi, Comedy, Stream of Consciousness. 5,023 words.)

Perhaps it is selfish of me to tell the truth at this point. Perhaps all the legends and myths about me, no matter how unnecessarily flattering, serve their purpose. Alas, I am an old man now - an old man who wants to sit in the grass and tell a story.

You’ve probably heard some rumor or other, but honestly, it doesn’t matter who I was before that fateful day I went to Goodwill. I barely remember myself and care even less. What I do recollect from is having some loose time in my day to go to the local thrift store and browse their fantastic wares.

It is impossible to know what I was looking for. No one goes to a thrift store knowing what they’ll get, they just vaguely hope they’ll find something that’ll irrevocably change everything for the better forever. Luckily, that’s exactly what happened to me. I remember wandering the aisles perusing the various objects on display; a Mickey Mouse alarm clock with faded plastic, a VHS copy of “Homeward Bound: Revelations” repaired with duct tape, a child’s science fair project that could’ve been mine for the low, low price of seventeen dollars.

It is a testament to the power of The Correct Item that it would stand out amongst this embarrassment of riches. In my minds eye I remember it levitating there, bobbing and rotating in midair emanating a golden aura alongside a gentle, angelic harmony. Of course, as you all know, I am prone to my romantic revisionisms and flights of fancy; like most inanimate home goods, it was probably just sitting there on the shelf.

Regardless, I stumbled towards it arms outstretched, mouth agape, heart racing and refusing to believe the evidence of my eyes until I held The Correct Item in my hands. This was it! The one missing piece in my life that would forever change everything evermore. A masterful blend of form and function, The Correct Item offered a plethora of practical utility while evoking a design sensibility that all at once nodded towards the Classical and Baroque but at the same time seemed thoroughly modern, maybe even with a futuristic flair. It would be impossible not to admire it for its otherworldly beauty while engaging with its myriad of uses. And incredibly, it was only five dollars more than what I had valued it in my head.

The Correct Item fit perfectly into that little, awkward nook in my apartment where nothing else seemed to fit. And like the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle sliding into place, my whole apartment came into a singular focus upon its installation; a harmonious, unified bow with The Correct Item as the knot at the center.

The effects of The Correct Item were immediate. With it in my possession, I started waking up not just on time but at a time that allowed me the space before work to eat a healthy breakfast, read a little, and sit outside admiring the morning dew while enjoying a cup of coffee. At work, I suddenly had extraordinary ideas regarding customer satisfaction, project workflows, operational procedures, and even HR practices that would satisfy employees and management alike. My relationships flourished. I easily charmed and ingratiated myself amongst even the most prickly of strangers. Friendships that I had maintained since childhood that had seemingly plateaued all of sudden went a level deeper. The dead end relationship I was in was able to be resolved in a graceful and mature manner where we remained amicable and we even introduced each other to our subsequent partners. And not to mention I was better at sex than ever before, reaching #1 on the local leaderboards.

All were in awe when I had guests over. “Wherever did you get this!?” they would exclaim in amazement and I would chuckle in response, swirling my spaghetti martini in one hand, “Oh, I just picked it up somewhere. Unfortunately, they don’t make things like this anymore.” My guests would rush online, trying any avenue to purchase a Correct Item for themselves, but alas, they only encountered scam posts and cheap knockoffs that were either comically and uselessly small, or branded with the logos of pop punk bands we’re all too embarrassed to admit we liked at some point or another, or made with MDF treated with a chemical that caused migraines and was prone to spontaneous combustion. Years later, historians would discover the company that made The Correct Item went bankrupt after their warehouse containing their entire stock was swallowed by a sinkhole caused by a nearby fracking operation. They never bothered picking up the only surviving unit that was on display at a mall some 90 miles away.

Word spread about my marvelous possession. Friends and family would find any reason to drop by. Curious neighbors would ring my doorbell and sheepishly ask to see it. After excusing myself to the bathroom, I caught the local reverend, who had turned up demanding to see what his flock was buzzing about, giving The Correct Item a big kiss. A mother running for the PTA board requested to have a photo op with it. After a groundswell of support due to the photo she changed her slogan to “Samantha Scarlett - The CORRECT Choice.” She won in a landslide with a voter turnout that, up until that point, was record setting not just for the local level but statewide as well.

Over the years, people have asked me about this period of time, “Weren’t you concerned that people were using you just to get to The Correct Item?” Each time I would laugh heartily, slap my hand on their shoulder and give them a sympathetic, yet pitying, look. They didn’t get it! And perhaps you don’t either, so I will lay it all down here - the quality of goods you buy are a direct reflection of who you are as a person. And The Correct Item, with its rich mahogany inlays, sturdy construction, and comprehensive Bluetooth connectivity, was simply the best purchase anyone has ever made. People came to conflate, rightly so, the durability, beauty, and usefulness of The Correct Item with the richness of my moral character. Not to mention the fact that I bought it at a thrift shop showed a thorough comprehension of commercial, economic, and mercantile matters. As such, I started to become a leader of the community. People would come to me for advice regarding love and life, squabblers would show up seeking arbitration, politicians would come seeking guidance on their various policies and upcoming votes. And I was correct in all things.

I didn’t really quite grasp the influence my object and I exhibited until the night it was almost stolen from me. Certainly, you know the story - it is but one of the many myths and legends repeated to school children about me - but please, indulge an old man for a moment.

I remember the man. He had the unfortunate name of Alan Rickman, forever living in the shadow of someone he had nothing to do with but happened to share a name with. He was a friend of a friend of a friend and one day accompanied one of that train to my apartment. He stood agape in the presence of The Correct Item, never tearing his gaze away from it while his friends and I talked. As goodbyes were underway, he let out a desperate and meek, “Can I touch it?” His friends laughed at him and told him to stop being weird. I gave them a scornful look and then smiled benevolently, “Of course, you can.” He ran forward like a child and clasped the giant dial on the front of The Correct Item with both hands and twisted it, gasping and giggling with each resonant, metallic clang from the inner workings of the mechanism. After three turns of the dial, I sternly let him know that was enough. I was trying to be kind and was unaware the effect of such a privilege would have on him.

Later that night, Alan Rickman was caught scaling the side of my apartment building with a burlap sack containing a crowbar and a sledgehammer. It is hotly contested to this day whether he meant to steal The Correct Item or to destroy it. The people that caught him were a self-styled band of vigilantes calling themselves The Disciples of the Correct Item, and they had taken upon themselves to watch over me and my home. This was the first I’d ever heard of them. I suppose I should’ve been more aware of the sudden uptick of hooded figures sulking about my neighborhood but I chalked it up to flowing crimson robes with gold fringe being back in style again, fashion being cyclical and all that.

The Disciples quickly apprehended Alan Rickman, who was no master thief. As three of them wrestled the poor man to the ground, the rest started forming a makeshift podium out in the middle of the street of whatever they could find. A hot-wired RV made up the main platform and piled around it were various garbage cans, lawn ornaments, and pulled up shrubbery. The end result was less stage and more pyre.

Three Disciples stood atop the RV with a restrained Alan Rickman while the rest formed a semicircle around the base of the pyre, anonymous in their crimson, hooded robes. One on top of the stage blew a strange horn to summon the surrounding community. It sounded like the dying cry of a long gone creature. This is what woke me up and I assumed the same of everyone else - that everyone was coming out to investigate the strange sound. I was wrong about that.

For maybe the only time ever, I had to ignore the Morning Printout coming out of The Correct Item and rushed outside. A large crowd had accumulated around the RV and Disciples were whipping them into a fury.

“Thief!” Shouted some.

“Desecrator!” shouted others.

A man crawled onto some of the garbage cans in front of the crowd. He was well dressed and had a naturally commanding presence about him. The crowd hushed as he raised his arms.

“I’ve been a civil rights advocate my whole life. I’ve defended the rights of everyone and anyone to the fullest extent of my abilities. For I believed in the rights of all no matter the circumstances.” He gestured towards Alan Rickman. “I no longer believe in such things. We should cut off this guy’s hands.” The crowd roared and undulated with eager justice. Torches were being lit and handed out. An enterprising opportunist was selling t-shirts commemorating the event and the biggest man you’ve ever seen pushed his way to the front of the crowd, holding an equally enormous axe in both hands. He climbed to the top of the RV in three large bounds and his silhouette blotted out the morning sun as his thick, hairy arms raised his ax over a trembling Alan Rickman.

“Stop!” I cried out from the front door of my apartment building and another hush came over the crowd. I looked out over the sea of unwavering stares and stepped forth. The people parted before me as I made my way. I clumsily climbed on top of the garbage cans and patio furniture before scrambling onto the roof of the RV. “Release this man at once,” I said through heavy breaths, exhausted from my ascent.

The Lead Disciple faced towards me; lit torch held at an angle above her head. An unnatural darkness obscured her face and made it hard to see her expressions. The huge man, ax held high and trembling as if only held back by a hair trigger, stared at me through the slits in the black sack covering his head. A tense silence permeated the air.

“The Proprietor… has chosen… MERCY!” the lead hooded woman bellowed in a sickly rasp and the crowd once again erupted in pandemonium, this time in revelry and celebration. Alan Rickman was unshackled and he fell to my feet, crying and clutching my legs. I picked him up and embraced him, demonstrating how I regarded him as an equal. He wound up becoming one of my closest friends, confidants, and personal advisors.

But of course, you know who Alan Rickman was. He was the general I put in charge to lead the campaign to retake Eastern Europe during The Unbeliever Uprising.

Soon afterwards I asked the Disciples of The Correct Item to disband, mostly because of their strange, alarming, and completely unwarranted behavior. I tried to be polite about it but they still seemed pretty upset and embarrassed. I think it was all these guys really had going on.

A few years later, I saw that huge guy working at a pet store somewhere in Beaverton, Oregon (yes, the stories are true! There WAS a Beaverton, Oregon and it was every bit as magical as you were told and more! Shame about that asteroid, though). He was pretty easy to recognize due to his immense size and the fact that he was still wearing that sack over his head and the same black tunic cinched at the waist with a bloodstained, tattered rope. After a few awkward hey-so-good-to-see-yous, we chatted for a bit and caught each other up on our lives. He explained that times were rough ever since the market for cultish executioners had dried up and he was forced to find other work, although he was doing alright now. I commiserated and told him about how so incredibly busy I was ever since several democratic governments capitulated to my growing influence. Once the pleasantries were exchanged, I relayed my need for a “lil’ somethin’-somethin’” for Goldfish Fridays down at the roller rink and he was more than helpful in helping me find exactly what I was looking for.

“Hey,” he called out to me as I was leaving, one foot out the door. I turned and he continued, “Those were some good times, huh?”

He was probably talking about the event with the Disciples (in which case, I think he was being overly sentimental and sappy over something that was actually a troubling display of what happens when men don’t have hobbies and healthy, offline communities; also, the whole thing lasted, like, five minutes, tops) however overall there was a spirit of optimism and hopefulness that swept the world. As people heard of my messianic figure and the cool thing I bought at Goodwill, they took to the streets to beg their leaders to become part of my new world order. In a country once called The United States of America, an unremarkable nation disregarded by history, a nationwide ballot measure was cast to strip their government of power and hand it all to me. The result was nearly unilateral in my favor and when questioned, the naysayers were horrified to realize they were holding their ballots upside down and not only did they against me, they had voted “Yes” on the referendum to make all the birds louder. One by one, all the countries of the world followed suite. For the first time in history, all the guns fell silent, all the mouths were fed, and all of mankind was able to join hands and be united under a single banner in peace and harmony in the name of The Correct Item.

Except for the Unbeliever Uprising, I forgot about that. Fuck, that was a nasty affair. Thank god for Alan Rickman.

Under my leadership, Earth entered a worldwide golden age. I ruled with utmost fairness and kindness for the entire populace with The Correct Item at my side, its Goodwill price sticker still stuck on one of its various levers. On the rare occasion two factions would come at odds with each other, and the mere sight of The Correct Item wasn’t able to qualm their quarrels, I was able to present hidden third options that satiated all parties involved. Earth became one economy. All of the planet’s resources were allocated appropriately and technology advanced in leaps and bounds to the point it resembled what would’ve been called “magic” a mere ten years ago and the word “impossible” fell out of use in the common vernacular. As a result of this monumental progress, Earth was more than prepared for the Calcinthinoid Incursion.

A scientist at SETI had one day entered the rough dimensions of The Correct Item as the frequency bandwidth the gigantic dish was currently receiving and had picked up subspace chatter from an unknown source. The messages were spoken in their alien language, which really just sounded like English but as if bugs were speaking it.

“The puny Earthlings are no match for our might! They are ripe for harvesting!” said one voice.

“Prepare the fleet at once!” said another.

“No need to rush!” screeched a third, “There’s no force in the galaxy that’d unite a planet quickly enough to resist our forces! We can use this time to learn to play the instruments we always wanted but never got around to!”

“I don’t know, I always get a little sad thinking about learning an instrument at my age,” responded the second alien, interspersing the clauses with an animalistic chittering, “It makes me feel like I’ve squandered the neuroplasticity of my youth.”

“Listen, nothing can get back the time we’ve already spent, but as the saying goes - the best time to plant a xinblorp was twenty cycles ago; the second best time is now. Let’s just do what makes us happy in the here and now and then we can go crush the weakling humans!”

Of course, the Calcinthinoids were working off of outdated information and when the invasion force arrived, the hammer of their armada smashed against the anvil of our planetary defense forces. While the Calcinthinoids were watching tutorial videos and plucking along to rudimentary melodies, Earth built up a vast, interconnected network of Orbital Hypernuclear Missile Platforms and Automated Plasma Railgun Stations, all backed up with carrier dreadnoughts, each capable of deploying 10,000 fighter craft. All these planetary fortifications were centralized in the ionosphere above the apartment where I still lived with The Correct Item.

The battle, still unnamed as historians argue whether it should sound really cool or somber and important, lasted for three days. The soldiers of the Calcinthinoid Empire, having never known defeat, fought fiercely. But they had come up against something they’ve never encountered. Something unstoppable. Something impervious to any weapon. For in every human there lies a fundamental truth that they’re willing to fight and to die for. You know what it is. It’s what we all say every night before bed. It is what every mother whispers to their newborn infant. It is what all schoolchildren say as they pledge allegiance to the human race every morning. Say it with me now.

“Somewhere out there is an item available for purchase that will change my life for the better.”

You know, I shouldn’t have mandated that children pledge allegiance to the human race. That was a strange thing to do.

Did you know this battle is where the Rings of Earth come from? It’s true. In the years following the battle, all the debris coalesced in an orbit around the equator. It may look beautiful from the inner atmosphere, but if you were to take a stratopod to the edges of our atmosphere you’d see the aftermath of those terrible few days; remains of spaceships floating lifelessly, bodies drifting among unexploded and unstable ordnance rendered too unsafe to retrieve, endless amounts of Calcinthinoid equivalents of Squire brand guitars. It is a sobering sight. But it is a ring we wear proudly. For if you look at Earth from anywhere in known space, you can see us wearing the symbol of our galactic superiority.

Humanity chased the routed Calcinthinoid fleet all the way back to their homeworld (coincidentally also called “Earth,” but, you know, like a bug would say it). It was only a matter of hours between establishing orbital supremacy and our quantum marines raising the Earth flag above the bombed-out structure of the Theocractic World Parliament of Calcinthin. As it were, at the moment of death Calcinthinoids would telepathically transmit the last sight they would ever see to the rest of their kind. So heavy were their losses, the entire species was almost constantly bombarded with the image of The Correct Item, a silhouette of which was stenciled upon the tail fins of our interplanetary cruisers and fighter craft. By the time we had boots on the ground, large swaths of the Calcinthinoid population had defected from their hectocentennial theocratic hegemony and begged our troopers for any information about The Correct Item.

I designed the Earth flag, by the way. I chose to represent Earth with a picture of Earth I found on Google Images. Next to it is a picture of The Correct Item I took with my phone, with my apartment fully visible in the background as I never really learned how to mask items in Photoshop. Underneath both of these pictures is the word “Earth!” in a neat typeface I found on dafont.com.

Having defeated the predominant force in the galaxy, Earth was now known as the prevailing regional power and all the civilizations and planets that suffered under Calcinthinoid rule flocked to ingratiate themselves, offering tribute to myself and The Correct Item. My apartment became the nexus of all political and commercial activity in all the known galaxy, much to the dismay of my landlord who tried to argue that intergalactic dignitaries and their entourages violated the provisions in the lease that stipulate that guests can only stay 3 days and pets weren’t allowed. A judge found his complaints frivolous and took the time to state that the comments regarding pets was xenophobic towards the Bloogians, who looked and acted like golden retrievers wearing top hats. After he lost the lawsuit, my landlord swore that he’d never rent an apartment to an intergalactic emperor ever again.

Peace and prosperity reigned throughout the Milky Way for over a century. I could bore you with the ins and outs of this period and the responsibilities bestowed upon a man of my station - managing hyperspace trade routes, dictating which planetary systems belonged to which spacefaring consortium, unmasking myself as a surprise guest in televised singing competitions - but what is important in my story is that eventually my star started to fall.

I was invited to be a guest of honor at a science symposium on a planet called q’Lanthenurp (but, you know, like how a bug would say it). I’d been to many functions and had stopped caring about them long ago, but in recent years it seemed like the flow of prestigious invitations had been stymied. My closest advisors, at least the ones who remained after all this time, begged me not to go.

“Your excellency,” they cried, “There’s no need for you to attend such a lowly and dangerous event as a science symposium!” I gently held up a bony, weathered hand to silence them. It had been a while since I was invited anywhere. I didn’t even notice they didn’t ask for the presence of The Correct Item.

I was a bit shocked to be seated so far in the back, and with a pillar blocking any possible sight of the main stage. Seated next to me was a Loplolian eating a hot dog. I eyed it hungrily, realizing my travel schedule hadn’t allowed me the chance for a bite in quite a while, an unfair burden on a man my age; at that point the oldest human to have ever lived. I leaned towards the Loplolian and asked, “Hey bud, where’d you get the hot dog?” I forgot that Loplolians take their time in responding to any inquiry. A simple answer to “How are you?” might take one upwards of a week for it to consider all the possible angles of response. Its mouth hung agape and all four hands clasped the hot dog tightly as its brow furrowed in immense thought. Meanwhile, onstage, someone suggested a way to reverse the effects of that disastrous referendum all those years ago and make the birds quieter once again. Pandemonium erupted. In all the uproar, an older scientist stood and shouted, “That’s impossible!” but no one really understood what that meant. “Oh, save your archaic language for the emperor; he’s the only one who’d understand you, old man!” shouted a hot, young scientist wearing sunglasses and a lab coat with the sleeves torn off to reveal extraordinarily built arms. I was expecting a stunned hush to come over the crowd, but it seemed everyone had forgotten I was there.

“Hot dog stand out front,” said the Loplolian, finally taking a bite.

The symposium entered a recess when one scientist ran another through with a saber for suggesting the existence of Scondos, which no one actually knew what they were, but we all know how science symposiums can get. I brushed past the paramedics and riot police rushing in, who were muttering “Fucking scientists, every goddamn year.”

The hot dog stand was just outside the main doors. A long line stretched across the terrace, around a gigantic statue depicting a man in a lab coat defiantly chugging something from an Erlenmeyer flask while two other men try to stop him, and out across a nearby road impeding the flow of traffic. Desperately hungry, I thought that I might be able to abuse my position for once in my storied career and cut to the front of the line.

“Hey, hey, hey!” cried the hot dog broker in a thick New York accent, “Who do you think you are!?”

“I sincerely apologize, I’m the Sovereign Emperor of Planet Earth and Her Outlying Colonies, I just…”

The man cut me off, clapping sarcastic over his shoulder, “Oh! The emperor! Look, everybody, it’s the emperor of the friggin’ Earth!” He stopped clapping and shrugged aggressively at me, “What? You think that makes you better than everybody else!?”

“I try to not let it get to my head, I just -“

“Back of the line, bub.”

While I stood in line for two hours and forty-five minutes for my hot dog, I pondered the ephemeral and cyclical nature of things. Tides ebb and flow, mountains form and wind blows them away, laundry is washed, folded, worn, and then washed again.

When I got back to Earth, I made the proper arrangements and booked a stratopod to where I knew in my heart this journey would end. I wore simple robes so that anyone looking would assume I was nothing more than one of the few scattered hermits still living on the Earth’s surface. 

“Are you sure this is where you wanna get off?” asked the stratopod operator, her voice ripe with confusion and worry. I looked her up and down; judging by her age there was a distinct chance she had never stepped foot on Terra firma in her life. Smiling, I wished her a nice day and alighted onto the ground below. 

The stratopod lifted up and into the sky, zooming off to one of the arcologies in the sky, egg-shaped cities made from glassy, transparent aluminum panels held together by biomechanical vines. If one listened closely, they could hear the whir of the trillions of semi-organic blades of leaves and grasses working together as wings and rotors to keep the grand bastions of humanity afloat among the cumulonimbus clouds, but this sound could easily be mistaken for the wind. These sanctuaries dotted the horizon all across the world and they are where most of humanity had chosen to live. You are probably reading this story in one right now.

A great, grassy plain stretched before me, miles of emerald green grasses swaying in a soft breeze and surrounded by pristine blue mountains. A reclaimer drone whizzed past me at an astonishing velocity, looking for any last bits of rubble or ruin of the various roads, homes, strip malls, libraries, and prisons that used to dot this area; in the blink of an eye it was already almost to the horizon, leaving behind a windswept wake in it’s path and only stopping for a split second to reconstitute an old street sign into its base elements to be reused in the restoration of the environs of old. 

After taking in the view, I hoisted The Correct Item onto my back, surprisingly lightweight considering its size and sturdy appearance. While doing so, I accidentally activated a hidden LED panel that showed the current time and temperature.

“My god,” I chuckled to myself, “Even after all these years you continue to surprise me.” 

I made off towards the only structure still remaining and operational, to my knowledge, in this sector. It was a squat rectangle of a building with a beige stucco exterior, nestled comfortably in the exact center of this immense field. Large blue letters and the familiar logo acted as a beacon, guiding me towards my final goal.

I stepped into the Goodwill and a glassy-eyed, slack jawed teenager rudely told me that they were closing in fifteen minutes. After a brief back and forth where I argued that just because they were closing soon that didn’t mean they were closed now, the teen acquiesced and accepted my donation. I watched as he placed The Correct Item on the shelf in between a gently used Scondo and a ratking made up of nine shoelaces tied together. 

For the first time in a long while, I had nothing to do and nowhere to be. I went outside and sat in the grass, picking a blade and absentmindedly breaking it into halves until I picked a new one, all while staring out at the world I had created. I thought about what that murderer at the pet store said all those years ago.

1pdlssq,https://i.redd.it/tztov5m0335g1.jpeg,Localized Blockchain Event Promotion Tools and Tactics,"# Understanding Hyperlocal Promotion in the Blockchain Space

Blockchain communities often start in small pockets before scaling. Hyperlocal promotion tools help organizers reach those early adopters who live, work, or socialize close to the venue. The concept borrows from mainstream local marketing but adds wallet-based targeting, smart contract ticketing, and on-chain analytics.

## Key Features of Hyperlocal Tools

1. **Geofenced Mobile Ads**  
   Ad platforms can draw a digital boundary—sometimes as small as a city block—around a conference center, co-working space, or university. Mobile devices that enter the zone receive banner ads or push notifications promoting the upcoming meetup. Because the radius is tight, impressions focus on people who could realistically attend with minimal travel.

2. **Bluetooth Beacons and NFC Tags**  
   Small transmitters placed at coffee shops, crypto ATMs, or public transit stops broadcast short messages to nearby phones. When combined with wallet detection, the message can vary based on whether the passerby has ever interacted with a DeFi protocol or holds a specific token. The tactic turns casual foot traffic into potential RSVP conversions.

3. **Smart Contract RSVP Systems**  
   Instead of collecting email addresses, an organizer can require a small cryptocurrency deposit to secure a seat. The contract refunds the deposit at check-in or redistributes it to attendees if the registrant fails to appear. This design discourages no-shows and produces an immutable attendance record.

4. **Token-Gated Ticketing dApps**  
   Tickets minted as non-fungible tokens remove the risk of counterfeit passes. A QR code at the door proves ownership without handing data to third-party vendors. When the ticket also doubles as a digital collectible, sponsors gain an additional touchpoint after the event through token-holder airdrops.

5. **Real-Time Sentiment Dashboards**  
   Social scraping tools track venue-level chatter on X, Telegram, and Discord. Organizers view spikes in discussion, adapt messaging, or increase ad spend for locations showing unexpected interest.

## How Geofencing Works in Practice

A geofence relies on latitude and longitude coordinates uploaded to an ad network. When a mobile identifier or ad-enabled wallet app crosses the boundary, a bidding process serves a tailored creative. For blockchain events, creatives often highlight:

- Speaker lineups featuring well-known developers
- Hands-on workshops for crypto newcomers
- Limited-supply NFT badges for early registrants

Because impressions are cheap at the neighborhood level, campaigns can iterate copy and imagery quickly. Successful variants then scale to broader radii as the date approaches.

## Integrating Physical and Digital Journeys

Hyperlocal tactics achieve higher conversion rates when combined with a clear post-event pathway. A common journey looks like this:

1. Individual notices a beacon message near a Bitcoin ATM.
2. Scans QR code, lands on smart-contract RSVP page.
3. Locks a small deposit, mints an NFT pass.
4. Attends workshop; badge scans create an on-chain record.
5. Receives follow-up push notification linking to a metaverse after-party.

The result is a seamless loop that moves from street corner to venue to virtual space without losing data continuity.

## Measuring Success Beyond Ticket Sales

Traditional metrics—registrations, attendance, and revenue—still matter. Hyperlocal tools add layers of data that inform future planning:

- **Heat Maps of Foot Traffic** show which subway exits or campus buildings deliver the most badge scans.
- **Wallet Cohorts** reveal whether DeFi power users convert at higher rates than NFT collectors.
- **Deposit Forfeiture Rates** indicate potential friction in location or timing, prompting schedule tweaks.

## Benefits for Sponsors and Stakeholders

Sponsors often fund educational tracks, hackathons, or demo booths. On-chain ticketing provides them with transparent engagement statistics without violating privacy. They can verify how many unique wallets entered a session and, if permitted, airdrop follow-up material directly to those wallets. This granular insight supports clearer ROI calculations compared with broad digital ad buys.

## Common Implementation Challenges

- **Fragmented Wallet Standards**: Not all attendees use the same wallet provider. Testing multiple solutions ensures smooth check-in across mobile and hardware wallets.
- **Regulatory Considerations**: In some jurisdictions, geofenced crypto ads face additional disclosure requirements. Legal review of creatives minimizes compliance risk.
- **Connectivity Constraints**: Venues with poor cell reception can slow QR verification. Offline signature buffers or local Wi-Fi hotspots mitigate delays.
- **Privacy Concerns**: While wallet addresses are pseudonymous, combining them with location data raises ethical questions. Clear consent mechanisms and data minimization practices build trust.

## Best Practices for Organizers

1. Pilot the geofence at least two weeks before the event to gather baseline data.  
2. Segment audiences by prior event attendance to refine messaging.  
3. Balance deposit sizes in smart-contract RSVPs; amounts too high deter newcomers, while amounts too low fail to prevent no-shows.  
4. Prepare fallback manual check-in methods to handle edge cases.

## Outlook for Hyperlocal Blockchain Events

As mainstream marketers adopt geotargeted media, blockchain projects gain a unique advantage: the ability to connect each impression to an on-chain action. Combining that traceability with face-to-face networking accelerates community formation. While no single tool guarantees a sold-out venue, a coordinated stack—geofencing, smart tickets, sentiment monitoring—provides measurable lift over traditional outreach alone.

In the long term, improvements in wallet privacy tech, open ad exchanges, and cross-chain identity will refine these tactics even further. Organizers who master the hyperlocal toolkit now position their communities for sustainable growth as larger audiences enter the decentralized world.

1pdlrw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1pdlrw4/a_lil_somethinsomethin_for_goldfish_fridays/,A Lil' Somethin-Somethin for Goldfish Fridays,"(Author's Note: First story I've written in quite a while and my community college writing workshop didn't hate it so I thought I'd share online for some feedback as well. Sci-Fi, Comedy, Stream of Consciousness. 5,023 words.)

Perhaps it is selfish of me to tell the truth at this point.  Perhaps all the legends and myths about me, no matter how unnecessarily flattering, serve their purpose. Alas, I am an old man now - an old man who wants to sit in the grass and tell a story. 

You’ve probably heard some rumor or other, but honestly, it doesn’t matter who I was before that fateful day I went to Goodwill. I barely remember myself and care even less. What I do recollect from is having some loose time in my day to go to the local thrift store and browse their fantastic wares.

It is impossible to know what I was looking for. No one goes to a thrift store knowing what they’ll get, they just vaguely hope they’ll find something that’ll irrevocably change everything for the better forever. Luckily, that’s exactly what happened to me. I remember wandering the aisles perusing the various objects on display; a Mickey Mouse alarm clock with faded plastic, a VHS copy of “Homeward Bound: Revelations” repaired with duct tape, a child’s science fair project that could’ve been mine for the low, low price of seventeen dollars. 

It is a testament to the power of The Correct Item that it would stand out amongst this embarrassment of riches. In my minds eye I remember it levitating there, bobbing and rotating in midair emanating a golden aura alongside a gentle, angelic harmony. Of course, as you all know, I am prone to my romantic revisionisms and flights of fancy; like most inanimate home goods, it was probably just sitting there on the shelf.

Regardless, I stumbled towards it arms outstretched, mouth agape, heart racing and refusing to believe the evidence of my eyes until I held The Correct Item in my hands. This was it! The one missing piece in my life that would forever change everything evermore. A masterful blend of form and function, The Correct Item offered a plethora of practical utility while evoking a design sensibility that all at once nodded towards the Classical and Baroque but at the same time seemed thoroughly modern, maybe even with a futuristic flair. It would be impossible not to admire it for its otherworldly beauty while engaging with its myriad of uses. And incredibly, it was only five dollars more than what I had valued it in my head.

The Correct Item fit perfectly into that little, awkward nook in my apartment where nothing else seemed to fit. And like the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle sliding into place, my whole apartment came into a singular focus upon its installation; a harmonious, unified bow with The Correct Item as the knot at the center. 

The effects of The Correct Item were immediate. With it in my possession, I started waking up not just on time but at a time that allowed me the space before work to eat a healthy breakfast, read a little, and sit outside admiring the morning dew while enjoying a cup of coffee. At work, I suddenly had extraordinary ideas regarding customer satisfaction, project workflows, operational procedures, and even HR practices that would satisfy employees and management alike. My relationships flourished. I easily charmed and ingratiated myself amongst even the most prickly of strangers. Friendships that I had maintained since childhood that had seemingly plateaued all of sudden went a level deeper. The dead end relationship I was in was able to be resolved in a graceful and mature manner where we remained amicable and we even introduced each other to our subsequent partners. And not to mention I was better at sex than ever before, reaching #1 on the local leaderboards. 

All were in awe when I had guests over. “Wherever did you get this!?” they would exclaim in amazement and I would chuckle in response, swirling my spaghetti martini in one hand, “Oh, I just picked it up somewhere. Unfortunately, they don’t make things like this anymore.” My guests would rush online, trying any avenue to purchase a Correct Item for themselves, but alas, they only encountered scam posts and cheap knockoffs that were either comically and uselessly small, or branded with the logos of pop punk bands we’re all too embarrassed to admit we liked at some point or another, or made with MDF treated with a chemical that caused migraines and was prone to spontaneous combustion. Years later, historians would discover the company that made The Correct Item went bankrupt after their warehouse containing their entire stock was swallowed by a sinkhole caused by a nearby fracking operation. They never bothered picking up the only surviving unit that was on display at a mall some 90 miles away.

Word spread about my marvelous possession. Friends and family would find any reason to drop by. Curious neighbors would ring my doorbell and sheepishly ask to see it. After excusing myself to the bathroom, I caught the local reverend, who had turned up demanding to see what his flock was buzzing about, giving The Correct Item a big kiss. A mother running for the PTA board requested to have a photo op with it. After a groundswell of support due to the photo she changed her slogan to “Samantha Scarlett - The CORRECT Choice.” She won in a landslide with a voter turnout that, up until that point, was record setting not just for the local level but statewide as well.

Over the years, people have asked me about this period of time, “Weren’t you concerned that people were using you just to get to The Correct Item?” Each time I would laugh heartily, slap my hand on their shoulder and give them a sympathetic, yet pitying, look. They didn’t get it! And perhaps you don’t either, so I will lay it all down here - the quality of goods you buy are a direct reflection of who you are as a person. And The Correct Item, with its rich mahogany inlays, sturdy construction, and comprehensive Bluetooth connectivity, was simply the best purchase anyone has ever made. People came to conflate, rightly so, the durability, beauty, and usefulness of The Correct Item with the richness of my moral character. Not to mention the fact that I bought it at a thrift shop showed a thorough comprehension of commercial, economic, and mercantile matters. As such, I started to become a leader of the community.  People would come to me for advice regarding love and life, squabblers would show up seeking arbitration, politicians would come seeking guidance on their various policies and upcoming votes. And I was correct in all things. 

I didn’t really quite grasp the influence my object and I exhibited until the night it was almost stolen from me. Certainly, you know the story - it is but one of the many myths and legends repeated to school children about me - but please, indulge an old man for a moment. 

I remember the man. He had the unfortunate name of Alan Rickman, forever living in the shadow of someone he had nothing to do with but happened to share a name with. He was a friend of a friend of a friend and one day accompanied one of that train to my apartment. He stood agape in the presence of The Correct Item, never tearing his gaze away from it while his friends and I talked. As goodbyes were underway, he let out a desperate and meek, “Can I touch it?” His friends laughed at him and told him to stop being weird. I gave them a scornful look and then smiled benevolently, “Of course, you can.” He ran forward like a child and clasped the giant dial on the front of The Correct Item with both hands and twisted it, gasping and giggling with each resonant, metallic clang from the inner workings of the mechanism. After three turns of the dial, I sternly let him know that was enough. I was trying to be kind and was unaware the effect of such a privilege would have on him. 

Later that night, Alan Rickman was caught scaling the side of my apartment building with a burlap sack containing a crowbar and a sledgehammer. It is hotly contested to this day whether he meant to steal The Correct Item or to destroy it. The people that caught him were a self-styled band of vigilantes calling themselves The Disciples of the Correct Item, and they had taken upon themselves to watch over me and my home. This was the first I’d ever heard of them. I suppose I should’ve been more aware of the sudden uptick of hooded figures sulking about my neighborhood but I chalked it up to flowing crimson robes with gold fringe being back in style again, fashion being cyclical and all that.  

The Disciples quickly apprehended Alan Rickman, who was no master thief. As three of them wrestled the poor man to the ground, the rest started forming a makeshift podium out in the middle of the street of whatever they could find. A hot-wired RV made up the main platform and piled around it were various garbage cans, lawn ornaments, and pulled up shrubbery. The end result was less stage and more pyre. 

Three Disciples stood atop the RV with a restrained Alan Rickman while the rest formed a semicircle around the base of the pyre, anonymous in their crimson, hooded robes. One on top of the stage blew a strange horn to summon the surrounding community. It sounded like the dying cry of a long gone creature. This is what woke me up and I assumed the same of everyone else - that everyone was coming out to investigate the strange sound. I was wrong about that.

For maybe the only time ever, I had to ignore the Morning Printout coming out of The Correct Item and rushed outside. A large crowd had accumulated around the RV and Disciples were whipping them into a fury. 

“Thief!” Shouted some. 

“Desecrator!” shouted others. 

A man crawled onto some of the garbage cans in front of the crowd. He was well dressed and had a naturally commanding presence about him. The crowd hushed as he raised his arms.

“I’ve been a civil rights advocate my whole life. I’ve defended the rights of everyone and anyone to the fullest extent of my abilities. For I believed in the rights of all no matter the circumstances.” He gestured towards Alan Rickman. “I no longer believe in such things. We should cut off this guy’s hands.” The crowd roared and undulated with eager justice. Torches were being lit and handed out. An enterprising opportunist was selling t-shirts commemorating the event and the biggest man you’ve ever seen pushed his way to the front of the crowd, holding an equally enormous axe in both hands. He climbed to the top of the RV in three large bounds and his silhouette blotted out the morning sun as his thick, hairy arms raised his ax over a trembling Alan Rickman.

“Stop!” I cried out from the front door of my apartment building and another hush came over the crowd. I looked out over the sea of unwavering stares and stepped forth. The people parted before me as I made my way. I clumsily climbed on top of the garbage cans and patio furniture before scrambling onto the roof of the RV. “Release this man at once,” I said through heavy breaths, exhausted from my ascent. 

The Lead Disciple faced towards me; lit torch held at an angle above her head. An unnatural darkness obscured her face and made it hard to see her expressions. The huge man, ax held high and trembling as if only held back by a hair trigger, stared at me through the slits in the black sack covering his head. A tense silence permeated the air.

“The Proprietor… has chosen… MERCY!” the lead hooded woman bellowed in a sickly rasp and the crowd once again erupted in pandemonium, this time in revelry and celebration. Alan Rickman was unshackled and he fell to my feet, crying and clutching my legs. I picked him up and embraced him, demonstrating how I regarded him as an equal. He wound up becoming one of my closest friends, confidants, and personal advisors.

But of course, you know who Alan Rickman was. He was the general I put in charge to lead the campaign to retake Eastern Europe during The Unbeliever Uprising.

Soon afterwards I asked the Disciples of The Correct Item to disband, mostly because of their strange, alarming, and completely unwarranted behavior. I tried to be polite about it but they still seemed pretty upset and embarrassed. I think it was all these guys really had going on. 

A few years later, I saw that huge guy working at a pet store somewhere in Beaverton, Oregon (yes, the stories are true! There WAS a Beaverton, Oregon and it was every bit as magical as you were told and more! Shame about that asteroid, though). He was pretty easy to recognize due to his immense size and the fact that he was still wearing that sack over his head and the same black tunic cinched at the waist with a bloodstained, tattered rope. After a few awkward hey-so-good-to-see-yous, we chatted for a bit and caught each other up on our lives. He explained that times were rough ever since the market for cultish executioners had dried up and he was forced to find other work, although he was doing alright now. I commiserated and told him about how so incredibly busy I was ever since several democratic governments capitulated to my growing influence. Once the pleasantries were exchanged, I relayed my need for a “lil’ somethin’-somethin’” for Goldfish Fridays down at the roller rink and he was more than helpful in helping me find exactly what I was looking for.

“Hey,” he called out to me as I was leaving, one foot out the door. I turned and he continued, “Those were some good times, huh?” 

He was probably talking about the event with the Disciples (in which case, I think he was being overly sentimental and sappy over something that was actually a troubling display of what happens when men don’t have hobbies and healthy, offline communities; also, the whole thing lasted, like, five minutes, tops) however overall there was a spirit of optimism and hopefulness that swept the world. As people heard of my messianic figure and the cool thing I bought at Goodwill, they took to the streets to beg their leaders to become part of my new world order. In a country once called The United States of America, an unremarkable nation disregarded by history, a nationwide ballot measure was cast to strip their government of power and hand it all to me. The result was nearly unilateral in my favor and when questioned, the naysayers were horrified to realize they were holding their ballots upside down and not only did they against me, they had voted “Yes” on the referendum to make all the birds louder. One by one, all the countries of the world followed suite. For the first time in history, all the guns fell silent, all the mouths were fed, and all of mankind was able to join hands and be united under a single banner in peace and harmony in the name of The Correct Item.

Except for the Unbeliever Uprising, I forgot about that. Fuck, that was a nasty affair. Thank god for Alan Rickman.

Under my leadership, Earth entered a worldwide golden age. I ruled with utmost fairness and kindness for the entire populace with The Correct Item at my side, its Goodwill price sticker still stuck on one of its various levers. On the rare occasion two factions would come at odds with each other, and the mere sight of The Correct Item wasn’t able to qualm their quarrels, I was able to present hidden third options that satiated all parties involved. Earth became one economy. All of the planet’s resources were allocated appropriately and technology advanced in leaps and bounds to the point it resembled what would’ve been called “magic” a mere ten years ago and the word “impossible” fell out of use in the common vernacular. As a result of this monumental progress, Earth was more than prepared for the Calcinthinoid Incursion. 

A scientist at SETI had one day entered the rough dimensions of The Correct Item as the frequency bandwidth the gigantic dish was currently receiving and had picked up subspace chatter from an unknown source. The messages were spoken in their alien language, which really just sounded like English but as if bugs were speaking it.  

“The puny Earthlings are no match for our might! They are ripe for harvesting!” said one voice.

“Prepare the fleet at once!” said another.

“No need to rush!” screeched a third, “There’s no force in the galaxy that’d unite a planet quickly enough to resist our forces! We can use this time to learn to play the instruments we always wanted but never got around to!”

“I don’t know, I always get a little sad thinking about learning an instrument at my age,” responded the second alien, interspersing the clauses with an animalistic chittering, “It makes me feel like I’ve squandered the neuroplasticity of my youth.” 

“Listen, nothing can get back the time we’ve already spent, but as the saying goes - the best time to plant a xinblorp was twenty cycles ago; the second best time is now. Let’s just do what makes us happy in the here and now and then we can go crush the weakling humans!”

Of course, the Calcinthinoids were working off of outdated information and when the invasion force arrived, the hammer of their armada smashed against the anvil of our planetary defense forces. While the Calcinthinoids were watching tutorial videos and plucking along to rudimentary melodies, Earth built up a vast, interconnected network of Orbital Hypernuclear Missile Platforms and Automated Plasma Railgun Stations, all backed up with carrier dreadnoughts, each capable of deploying 10,000 fighter craft. All these planetary fortifications were centralized in the ionosphere above the apartment where I still lived with The Correct Item. 

The battle, still unnamed as historians argue whether it should sound really cool or somber and important, lasted for three days. The soldiers of the Calcinthinoid Empire, having never known defeat, fought fiercely. But they had come up against something they’ve never encountered. Something unstoppable. Something impervious to any weapon. For in every human there lies a fundamental truth that they’re willing to fight and to die for. You know what it is. It’s what we all say every night before bed. It is what every mother whispers to their newborn infant. It is what all schoolchildren say as they pledge allegiance to the human race every morning. Say it with me now.

“Somewhere out there is an item available for purchase that will change my life for the better.”

You know, I shouldn’t have mandated that children pledge allegiance to the human race. That was a strange thing to do.

Did you know this battle is where the Rings of Earth come from? It’s true. In the years following the battle, all the debris coalesced in an orbit around the equator. It may look beautiful from the inner atmosphere, but if you were to take a stratopod to the edges of our atmosphere you’d see the aftermath of those terrible few days; remains of spaceships floating lifelessly, bodies drifting among unexploded and unstable ordnance rendered too unsafe to retrieve, endless amounts of Calcinthinoid equivalents of Squire brand guitars. It is a sobering sight. But it is a ring we wear proudly. For if you look at Earth from anywhere in known space, you can see us wearing the symbol of our galactic superiority. 

Humanity chased the routed Calcinthinoid fleet all the way back to their homeworld (coincidentally also called “Earth,” but, you know, like a bug would say it). It was only a matter of hours between establishing orbital supremacy and our quantum marines raising the Earth flag above the bombed-out structure of the Theocractic World Parliament of Calcinthin. As it were, at the moment of death Calcinthinoids would telepathically transmit the last sight they would ever see to the rest of their kind. So heavy were their losses, the entire species was almost constantly bombarded with the image of The Correct Item, a silhouette of which was stenciled upon the tail fins of our interplanetary cruisers and fighter craft. By the time we had boots on the ground, large swaths of the Calcinthinoid population had defected from their hectocentennial theocratic hegemony and begged our troopers for any information about The Correct Item. 

I designed the Earth flag, by the way. I chose to represent Earth with a picture of Earth I found on Google Images. Next to it is a picture of The Correct Item I took with my phone, with my apartment fully visible in the background as I never really learned how to mask items in Photoshop. Underneath both of these pictures is the word “Earth!” in a neat typeface I found on dafont.com.

Having defeated the predominant force in the galaxy, Earth was now known as the prevailing regional power and all the civilizations and planets that suffered under Calcinthinoid rule flocked to ingratiate themselves, offering tribute to myself and The Correct Item. My apartment became the nexus of all political and commercial activity in all the known galaxy, much to the dismay of my landlord who tried to argue that intergalactic dignitaries and their entourages violated the provisions in the lease that stipulate that guests can only stay 3 days and pets weren’t allowed. A judge found his complaints frivolous and took the time to state that the comments regarding pets was xenophobic towards the Bloogians, who looked and acted like golden retrievers wearing top hats. After he lost the lawsuit, my landlord swore that he’d never rent an apartment to an intergalactic emperor ever again. 

Peace and prosperity reigned throughout the Milky Way for over a century. I could bore you with the ins and outs of this period and the responsibilities bestowed upon a man of my station - managing hyperspace trade routes, dictating which planetary systems belonged to which spacefaring consortium, unmasking myself as a surprise guest in televised singing competitions - but what is important in my story is that eventually my star started to fall. 

I was invited to be a guest of honor at a science symposium on a planet called q’Lanthenurp (but, you know, like how a bug would say it). I’d been to many functions and had stopped caring about them long ago, but in recent years it seemed like the flow of prestigious invitations had been stymied. My closest advisors, at least the ones who remained after all this time, begged me not to go. 

“Your excellency,” they cried, “There’s no need for you to attend such a lowly and dangerous event as a science symposium!” I gently held up a bony, weathered hand to silence them. It had been a while since I was invited anywhere. I didn’t even notice they didn’t ask for the presence of The Correct Item.

I was a bit shocked to be seated so far in the back, and with a pillar blocking any possible sight of the main stage. Seated next to me was a Loplolian eating a hot dog. I eyed it hungrily, realizing my travel schedule hadn’t allowed me the chance for a bite in quite a while, an unfair burden on a man my age; at that point the oldest human to have ever lived. I leaned towards the Loplolian and asked, “Hey bud, where’d you get the hot dog?” I forgot that Loplolians take their time in responding to any inquiry. A simple answer to “How are you?” might take one upwards of a week for it to consider all the possible angles of response. Its mouth hung agape and all four hands clasped the hot dog tightly as its brow furrowed in immense thought. Meanwhile, onstage, someone suggested a way to reverse the effects of that disastrous referendum all those years ago and make the birds quieter once again. Pandemonium erupted. In all the uproar, an older scientist stood and shouted, “That’s impossible!” but no one really understood what that meant. “Oh, save your archaic language for the emperor; he’s the only one who’d understand you, old man!” shouted a hot, young scientist wearing sunglasses and a lab coat with the sleeves torn off to reveal extraordinarily built arms. I was expecting a stunned hush to come over the crowd, but it seemed everyone had forgotten I was there. 

“Hot dog stand out front,” said the Loplolian, finally taking a bite.

The symposium entered a recess when one scientist ran another through with a saber for suggesting the existence of Scondos, which no one actually knew what they were, but we all know how science symposiums can get. I brushed past the paramedics and riot police rushing in, who were muttering “Fucking scientists, every goddamn year.”

The hot dog stand was just outside the main doors. A long line stretched across the terrace, around a gigantic statue depicting a man in a lab coat defiantly chugging something from an Erlenmeyer flask while two other men try to stop him, and out across a nearby road impeding the flow of traffic. Desperately hungry, I thought that I might be able to abuse my position for once in my storied career and cut to the front of the line.

“Hey, hey, hey!” cried the hot dog broker in a thick New York accent, “Who do you think you are!?”

“I sincerely apologize, I’m the Sovereign Emperor of Planet Earth and Her Outlying Colonies, I just…”

The man cut me off, clapping sarcastic over his shoulder, “Oh! The emperor! Look, everybody, it’s the emperor of the friggin’ Earth!” He stopped clapping and shrugged aggressively at me, “What? You think that makes you better than everybody else!?” 

“I try to not let it get to my head, I just -“

“Back of the line, bub.”

While I stood in line for two hours and forty-five minutes for my hot dog, I pondered the ephemeral and cyclical nature of things. Tides ebb and flow, mountains form and wind blows them away, laundry is washed, folded, worn, and then washed again. 

When I got back to Earth, I made the proper arrangements and booked a stratopod to where I knew in my heart this journey would end. I wore simple robes so that anyone looking would assume I was nothing more than one of the few scattered hermits still living on the Earth’s surface. 

“Are you sure this is where you wanna get off?” asked the stratopod operator, her voice ripe with confusion and worry. I looked her up and down; judging by her age there was a distinct chance she had never stepped foot on Terra firma in her life. Smiling, I wished her a nice day and alighted onto the ground below. 

The stratopod lifted up and into the sky, zooming off to one of the arcologies in the sky, egg-shaped cities made from glassy, transparent aluminum panels held together by biomechanical vines. If one listened closely, they could hear the whir of the trillions of semi-organic blades of leaves and grasses working together as wings and rotors to keep the grand bastions of humanity afloat among the cumulonimbus clouds, but this sound could easily be mistaken for the wind. These sanctuaries dotted the horizon all across the world and they are where most of humanity had chosen to live. You are probably reading this story in one right now.

A great, grassy plain stretched before me, miles of emerald green grasses swaying in a soft breeze and surrounded by pristine blue mountains. A reclaimer drone whizzed past me at an astonishing velocity, looking for any last bits of rubble or ruin of the various roads, homes, strip malls, libraries, and prisons that used to dot this area; in the blink of an eye it was already almost to the horizon, leaving behind a windswept wake in it’s path and only stopping for a split second to reconstitute an old street sign into its base elements to be reused in the restoration of the environs of old. 

After taking in the view, I hoisted The Correct Item onto my back, surprisingly lightweight considering its size and sturdy appearance. While doing so, I accidentally activated a hidden LED panel that showed the current time and temperature.

“My god,” I chuckled to myself, “Even after all these years you continue to surprise me.” 

I made off towards the only structure still remaining and operational, to my knowledge, in this sector. It was a squat rectangle of a building with a beige stucco exterior, nestled comfortably in the exact center of this immense field. Large blue letters and the familiar logo acted as a beacon, guiding me towards my final goal.

I stepped into the Goodwill and a glassy-eyed, slack jawed teenager rudely told me that they were closing in fifteen minutes. After a brief back and forth where I argued that just because they were closing soon that didn’t mean they were closed now, the teen acquiesced and accepted my donation. I watched as he placed The Correct Item on the shelf in between a gently used Scondo and a ratking made up of nine shoelaces tied together. 

For the first time in a long while, I had nothing to do and nowhere to be. I went outside and sat in the grass, picking a blade and absentmindedly breaking it into halves until I picked a new one, all while staring out at the world I had created. I thought about what that murderer at the pet store said all those years ago.

Although 6 people have been convicted and incarcerated, nobody knows what happened to the girl, including the kidnappers themselves.","(Thanks to [lttlgrdg3](https://www.reddit.com/user/lttlgrdg3/) for suggesting this case. If you'd like to suggest any yourself, please head over to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/moondog151/comments/1k2a5bn/for_my_international_readers_or_anyone_interested/), which asks for case suggestions from my international readers, as I focus on international cases.

EDIT: Probably should've clarified in the title that those convicted don't actually know her ultimate fate or where she is now.)

On September 30, 2009, a girl was born in San Antonio de Padua, a rural village in Nariño, Colombia. This girl would be named Paula Nicole Palacios Narváez.

[Paula Nicole Palacios Narváez](https://preview.redd.it/ptyvrwlfc25g1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=2720beb4d343242a1189686f8e2e60ff341a3ef1)

Initially, it seemed as if Paula Nicole would live a rather unassuming life. She was the first child of two farmers who had been working the land from a very young age, as had her entire family for several generations.

Their humble living from cultivating potatoes, coffee beans and barley provided just enough for them to live a somewhat comfortable life and provide their two children with clothes, a warm home and food. But beyond that, they couldn't afford many extra luxuries and lived in a remote mountainous area.

Most of Paula Nicole's extended family lived in close proximity to her parents' farm; one such relative was her aunt, with whom Paula Nicole was very close. Due to how close her relatives lived, the short distances involved and the relative safety of their village, Paula Nicole was awarded a great deal of freedom and allowed to visit any of her relatives or go to the store without supervision.

At 3:30 p.m. on December 28, 2014, Paula Nicole set off toward her aunt's house as she wanted to try on some clothes she had been given as a Christmas gift. Her aunt lived a distance of less than 100 meters along a single paved road, so it would by no means take her long at all to get there, try on the clothes and walk back. Especially since it was a path Paula Nicole had walked several times before.

Naturally, it didn't take long for both her aunt and parents to take notice when Paula failed to arrive either at her aunt's or back home. Her parents went through the village, knocking on the door to every single house and asking their neighbours if anyone had seen Paula. When everyone they asked said no, they went to Buesaco, where the nearest police station was located and reported their daughter missing.

At first, the officers weren't too alarmed. Buesaco was much bigger than their small village, so to them it seemed like Paula Nicole hadn't been missing long enough to be this concerned. Luckily for her family, the police began taking the matter more seriously later that same day.

The police began their investigation much the same way her parents did, by going door-to-door to ask about her. The locals told the police that they saw two grey pickup trucks circling the area that day. One neighbour added that he saw the truck speed up just after Paula Nicole began her walk, although he couldn't see if anyone inside had forced her into the truck, nor could he even identify anyone who was in it.

Unfortunately, that was it; the police had barely any witnesses to question; in fact, only 87 were questioned during the entire course of the investigation. Additionally, owing to the rural, isolated and overall economically depressed nature of San Antonio de Padua, there were no CCTV cameras to speak of. As far as anyone knew, the last person to see Paula Nicole was her own mother, who saw her playing in a puddle before waving to her as she left for her aunt's home.

The government of the Nariño department printed several missing persons containing Paula Nicole's information, and their agents travelled across the area to distribute them. Going from village to village and dropping them off door-to-door in each village, visiting the many solitary farms to show them to their owners, and even stopping buses that were driving through the rural countryside to ensure the driver and every one of their passengers got their own flyer. The same went for any vehicle; even motorbikes were stopped, so the police made sure the driver was handed a flyer. Through these efforts, a total of 7,000 flyers were distributed.

As for the search itself? Over hundreds of officers were deployed, aided by soldiers from the Colombian military. The police, army and sniffer dogs spent several weeks searching the mountainous terrain and vast farmlands, but to no avail.

[One of the many search operations](https://preview.redd.it/htcsn4lnu25g1.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6fc882650f2d329b99747feb32735445e33d6fa)

If Paula Nicole had been forced into one of the pickup trucks the witnesses saw, then the dogs wouldn't have been able to follow her scent regardless.

On January 16, 2015, the Colombian government as well as well as Nariño's local government, both issued a reward for anyone with information that could lead to Paula Nicole's safe return. The reward was initially set at 50 million Colombian Pesos and was soon increased shortly after being issued.

Once the reward became public knowledge, many took advantage of it. The police's tip line was flooded by liars and con artists who gave deliberately false leads in hopes the police would accept one of them and pay them the reward.

Some even went so far as to actually try and claim the reward and demand the money. These same people would also call Paula Nicole's parents directly, trying to extort them with false claims of being her kidnappers and only releasing her upon being paid 30 million pesos, or else they'd kill her.

For that one in particular, her family knew it was fake right away and refused to engage with the caller, often hanging up mid-call. After being ignored and disregarded for a week, they called again to ""generously"" reduce their demand to 25 million pesos. A majority of these callers were tracked down, prosecuted and given actual prison terms rather than just fines.

By February, the Colombian authorities had filed an Interpol Yellow Notice for Paula Nicole, with the Colombian police reaching out to the police forces of Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil to search for her in case she had been smuggled across the border. The reward was also increased to 70 million pesos, and then to 200 million pesos.

On February 11, the search extended to Nariño's neighbouring departments of Cauca and Putumayo. Those two departments share a similar geography to Nariño's, being mostly farmlands and mountains. The terrain was searched just as extensively as it was in Nariño, but the authorities still came up empty-handed.

All across Colombia, the people would take to the streets, marching with banners of the missing child, demanding action and more effort to be put into finding her. Many of those taking part in this search were children themselves, and some of the marches were even led by children. All of Colombia was watching the investigation and was desperate to see Paula Nicole's safe return.

[One of the marches](https://preview.redd.it/8xr23po0y25g1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=676a85afe79e9ff545c8e8751e449ca0ee7e7b67)

But the police, after nearly a year, still had nothing to work off except for the witness's talking about the grey pick-up trucks, of which they weren't even sure were involved in her disappearance yet.

But the police didn't give up and continued questioning the witnesses who had seen the pick-up trucks. This time, they were around with black-and-white photographs of potential suspects that matched the few descriptions the witnesses were able to give. Two seperate people both pointed to the same picture and identified him as one of the men in the trucks; the man they pointed to was 37-year-old José Germán Paguatian Insandara.

Paguatian Insandara, originally from Solita in the Caquetá department, was arrested in 2009 by the local police for attempted murder and assault. For this crime, he was given a 6-year sentence, but eventually he was granted parole, which he was currently on at the time.

After his release, he moved to Nariño, where he was working as a day labourer on a farm. At that farm, he served as the head of a chicken coop. Prior criminal history and the witness statements aside, there was one more thing that made Paguatian Insandara a compelling suspect: he was no stranger to Paula Nicole's family; he was the cousin of Paula Nicole's mother.

On November 5, 2015, the police went to the farm in Taminango and placed Paguatian Insandara under arrest without incident. After close to a year, the police finally had a suspect in custody.

[Paguatian Insandara after his arrest.](https://preview.redd.it/3e3aeuwsd25g1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=369c15990e670e9213853b9fc1b77fa84b53160c)

Even better, their suspect confessed to kidnapping Paula Nicole as soon as he was questioned. However, he fiercely denied killing her, at least not with his own hands.

According to him, in late November 2014, he was contacted by 52-year-old Blanca Digna López. According to Paguatian Insandara, Blanca was involved in just about every illegal trade imaginable, from the illicit sale of firearms, motorcycle theft and of course, the trafficking of children and that 50 and 60 million pesos could be obtained for each child trafficked.

Paguatian Insandara told the police that Blanca had contacts in Cali and Bogotá and even remembered verbatim the exact words Blanca said to him when proposing the kidnapping to him. ""Look, Germán, that's good, don't be foolish, killing yourself on the farm because that's so little that you earn, when there are ways to work more easily"".

The police recalled how the witnesses initially reported seeing two pickup trucks in the vicinity of San Antonio de Padua; therefore, Paguatian Insandara likely had an accomplice. Sure enough, they were correct, and he even named them in his full confession, which, in his own words, went something like this.

""I saw Blanca and Yolanda at the entrance of the school and the girl, I saw that she was about five meters away, there Blanca signaled to me that there was the girl and at that moment I got down and opened the door and Yolanda got in, she picked up the girl, I got in behind her and I held the girl"".

""Blanca prevented the girl from screaming with a scarf, with the same scarf they tied her hands. The girl was crying and struggling, and at that moment the truck started, and we left by the road to Pasisara, we continued on the road to Cimarrones, and we came out at the height of the Panamericana.""

Paguatian Insandara was then dropped off at Taminango and met back up with them on December 30 to receive a payment of one million pesos. As for why Blanca chose Paula Nicole, he said: ""It was rumoured in the town that Mrs. Blanca López had a series of problems with the family of the minor Paula Nicole. It was said that the family owed her money, and that's why she took the girl and sold her, and she herself went to deliver her to Cali.""

The final question asked of him was what Paula Nicole's ultimate fate had been. He said, ""The last thing I knew was that they sold her for organ sales and that the buyers would be in Cali, waiting for the arrival of the minor, and I don't know where they would take her. At this moment, I don't know if she is alive or dead.""

Although sometimes he'd contradict that last part and instead say that Paula Nicole had been trafficked across the border and was sold to a family in Ecuador for five million pesos. This seemed to be the story the police believed, as the director of the National Police of Colombia stated at a press conference, and because San Antonio de Padua was only an hour's drive from the Ecuadorian border.

Whoever they sold her to, one thing remained unchanged. The police had a suspect who confessed, and yet had no idea what happened to Paula Nicole or where she was.

The next suspect arrested was none other than his ex-partner, Doris Yolanda Pinta Matabajoy. On November 26, Yolanda was arrested in the town of Chachagüí in full view of the public. She was the ""Yolanda"" Paguatian Insandara was referring to in his confession.

Paguatian Insandara also wasn't lying about Blanca. The police were able to verify that she was a real person, and true to his word, she did have contacts in Cali. On November 26, the police tracked her down and arrested her in the Los Comuneros neighbourhood of Cali.

[Blanca after her arrest](https://preview.redd.it/mm44dzmph25g1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eeb6a93927294e94ed9a4142299c567d14e85c2)

Blanca's motive for singling out Paula Nicole was reportedly due to a feud her family had with Paula Nicole's family when a member of Paula Nicole's family abruptly ended an engagement with a member of Blanca's family, which offended her family greatly.

While Blanca masterminded the abduction, and Paguatian Insandara and Yolanda took part in the kidnapping, there were still more accomplices the police needed to track down. The police looked into the three's acquaintances and showed more pictures to the witnesses until they finally identified the last three kidnappers.

On November 30, a 37-year-old construction worker named Luis Antonio López Ojeda was arrested in Buesaco. Ojeda once worked on the family's farm, and the police believed he was the driver of one of the trucks involved in Paula Nicole's kidnapping.

Next was another construction worker who was also 37 years old. He was arrested in Bucaramanga on January 21, 2016. His name was Erwin David Quintero Martínez, and the police believed he was the driver of the truck Paula Nicole had been forced into.

[Erwin after his arrest.](https://preview.redd.it/cluiiewlh25g1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88557df378671f6a931b456260f0c03d90e9f82)

In addition, he acted as a lookout to make sure there weren't any witnesses or police around who could witness the abduction itself. He had been paid three million Colombian pesos for doing this.

The next arrest was that of Fabio Iván Insandará Narváez (Sometimes referred to as Mario Isandara Narváez), arrested on January 21, 2016, in Buesaco. Another cousin of Paula Nicole's mother. He was believed to have provided the kidnappers with information that helped in the abduction. He was arrested after Yolanda implicated him.

With how close Fabio was to the family, some officers who were a part of the investigation actually began suspecting that Paula Nicole's mother must've been involved purely on the basis that Fabio was. One investigator even went to her mother's house and told her to reveal where Paula Nicole was, even saying to her mother that she'd probably be ""better off with a different family."" However, the actual police at large did not suspect any involvement on her part.

Jesus Fernando Lopez Bolaños was also arrested in January 2016 in Bucaramanga under suspicion of trafficking Paula Nicole.

Naturally, all these new suspects were asked the same question they had asked Paguatian Insandara: Where was Paula Nicole?. Sadly, they all had the same answer. Once again, they all gave conflicting information on who exactly they sold Paula Nicole to. Still, the answer remained the same: none of them had any idea what happened to Paula Nicole after she was handed over. And that was if they even answered to begin with.

Feeling defeated after that setback and not hearing back from the Ecuadorian police, the authorities felt there was only one more thing left to do. In January 2016, the governor of Nariño personally had the reward raised to 300 million Colombian pesos. Unfortunately, no reliable tips came after this announcement either.

Although they were all being charged for the same crime, they were not tried together. Paguatian Insandara was the first to go to trial, with his trial starting in September 2017 at the First Specialized Criminal Court of the Circuit of Pasto, where he was charged with ""aggravated forced disappearance."" The prosecution's case was relatively straightforward; they relied on the testimony of the witnesses who identified him, as well as his own confession and statements.

[Paguatian Insandara in court](https://preview.redd.it/q5vs8oh8c25g1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=2433555f7738e183b928853a9d67f1b4a91e46ba)

And on the topic of that confession, Paguatian Insandara retracted it in court. He refused to accept the charges and declared himself innocent, even referring to his arrest as a ""false positive"".  Paguatian Insandara's defence attorney also accused the police and prosecutors of committing ""a great falsehood,"" insinuating that they were scapegoating him.

Paula Nicole's mother also spoke to the media around this time, saying that her family wasn't too close to Paguatian Insandara despite what the media said. In fact, she didn't even recognize him at first. This was a statement the defence attempted to capitalize on, but to no avail.

On September 18, 2017, José Germán Paguatian Insandara was found guilty of causing the ""forced disappearance"" of Paula Nicole Palacios Narváez. On November 7, the judge handed down a sentence of 42 years and 6 months in prison, along with a fine equivalent to 3,000 monthly wages.

Paguatian Insandara's defence launched an appeal, where on June 14, 2020, the Superior Court of Pasto upheld his conviction and sentence.

Blanca, Erwin, Jesús, Luis and Fabio were all tried together. On July 17, 2018, Blanca Digna López, Erwin David Quintero Martínez, Jesús Fernando López Bolaños, and Luis Antonio López Ojeda were also all convicted. On December 13, the four were sentenced to 42 years and 6 months in prison plus fines equivalent to 3,000 monthly wages each.

Unfortunately, they never served those sentences. At the time of their sentencing, the four were not in jail; instead, because of a procedural deadline expiring, they were free during the trial, albeit still under a ""conditional arrest"". By the time the sentences had been handed down, Blanca and Erwin's homes were abandoned, and both were nowhere to be found, while Luis and Jesús both stayed behind and were brought to prison to begin their lengthy sentences. Blanca and Erwin remain fugitives to this day.

As for the fifth defendant, Fabio Iván Insandará Narváez, as a reminder, he was arrested back in January, allegedly for providing the kidnappers with information they used to aid in their plan. Well, ever since his arrest, Paula Nicole's family had been publicly advocating for his innocence and insisting he was wrongfully accused. The court agreed, and they found no evidence supporting the prosecution's claims, so Fabio was acquitted and walked out of court a free man.

Finally, there was Doris Yolanda Pinta Matabajoy. Yolanda's case was separated from the other 5 defendants, but it still progressed slowly. In April 2017, Yolanda was released under certain conditions for the same reason as the other four: a procedural deadline had expired. She was the first of the 5 released under this oversight, though fortunately, she didn't run away like Blanca and Jesús.

However, the Colombian courts have been slow to progress with her case. Her trial was scheduled to begin on February 10, 2020, until the COVID-19 pandemic caused it to be delayed. Paula Nicole's mother attempted to contact the prosecutor's office to find out the status of Yolanda's case, but hasn't heard back.

On December 28, 2020, the 6th anniversary of her disappearance, Paula Nicole's missing person flyers were updated to include an age progression of what she might look like at 11 years old.

https://preview.redd.it/i6e0mxaed25g1.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=f11863b35eba25fea5d62bd3712a5ee961938eed

Unfortunately, that is where the case ends, with only three of the six defendants actually in prison and without a single trace of Paula Nicole being found.

Today, Paula Nicole's mother is divorced and lives in Ipiales with her son, where she works as a ""domestic worker"" for a local family. But through it all, she has stated that she holds out hope that Paula Nicole is still alive, and that is a hope shared by many, including the police, who have not once declared Paula Nicole to be dead and still maintain that 300 million award for any information that could lead to her safe return. In addition, her Interpol Yellow Notice remains active.

Even though there have been convictions and sentences, Paula Nicole's case remains technically unsolved. Her whereabouts, as well as those of Blanca and Erwin, are mysteries to this very day.

If she is still alive, Paula Nicole Palacios Narváez would be 16 years old today.

I’m looking for fun people to go out on the weekends with and grab a drink, go dancing, or play board games. I’ve been in Portland 8 years and haven’t made very many quality friends. Only have one treasured person at the moment. Originally from a small town in the east bay. Working from home as a graphic designer for the past decade hasn’t helped my social life. Some of my interests are dancing, drawing/painting/ceramics, yoga, just getting into archery/strength training. I diagnosed with ADHD this year. So those are just the ones I am currently spending time doing. But I am a very curious person and have lots of interests and love learning new things. Message me if you’re up to grab a drink/coffee/tea this weekend, or want to hit up some bookstores.

We (me, Margaret, Delilah) eventually began having problems with Payley, which ended in a long drawn out attempt to talk and an eventual unsatisfactory discussion.

This year, now juniors, Margaret, Delilah and I live together again. We were super excited about it and looking forward to being able to enjoy hanging out without having to feel the tension of an avoidant roommate. The apartment is a small two story w two bedrooms on the second floor w a full bath and one bedroom on the ground floor w a half bath. I live on the ground floor cause my dog has a bad hip (they had no problems w this). This is important to remember.

Our university starts classes on Tuesday every semester, so we were pleasantly surprised to be walking together for our first class. Tues/Thurs classes are an hour 15 so we left at 9am for our 9:30. They both had the same class (both Bio majors) and had a bit of a further walk than me, so I'm only with them for about half of their 15 minute walk. The first couple weeks I'm able to keep a pretty consistent sleep schedule (this quickly falls apart when I procrastinate on an assignment and have to stay up late to get it done). So for about 2 weeks (4 classes) I get up at 8 and take my dog out. I think the third Tuesday I wake up late (around 8:30) but decide to take dog out anyway and end up coming back in like 5 minutes late (9:05). They say nothing about it, I apologize for making us leave later than usual and then we head out. Maybe a week later I wake up super late and rush around to get ready, but we still end up leaving closer to 9:10 than I would like since that inconveniences them. I apologize again, they don't say anything. This does not happen again.

On October 7th, I wake up on time, I go do everything in the bathroom (including flushing the toilet and running the sink), and then head back to my room for my bag and shoes. You have to pass the kitchen to get to my bathroom, Margaret was in the kitchen making coffee when I walked back to my room (she may have had earbuds in, she usually does, I wasn't paying any attention). When I get to my room I decide I actually don't want to wear the shirt I had on, and close the door. It took me maybe a minute to change my shirt and as I'm slipping my shoes on (the end of my bed lines up with the door frame, which is where I leave my shoes, so I don't reopen the door yet) I hear the front door close. I'm of course a little shocked and confused, but then I see them pass across the window.

I decide to send a snap of them walking to our gc with the caption, ""well fuck me ig"", and receive no response yet they both open it. At this point they've crossed the road to walk on that side while I've stayed on the original side because I prefer crossing the road later. After I cross I decide to send another snap captioned, ""you ever think about how you look when you walk?"" ""you two look like abandoners"", yes I know, very playground/childish insult but I struggled to think of something other than straight up calling them assholes. In response, they tell me in a very bluntly worded (frankly bitchy) way that they needed to leave exactly on time because the sidewalk they take to class was blocked off today. I'm still pretty pissed so I don't say anything back. I work on Tuesdays and Thursdays so I take the time I'm in class and then work to hopefully calm down and get over it. We watch a movie and do homework in the living room than night, they don't say anything about it so I don't bring it up. Same thing Wednesday, we got dinner and then did homework w a movie on. This was not malicious in intent, I simply didn't want to talk since I was still upset and trying to ignore it. This is not how you handle something like this I know, but any extra time I have outside of work and school is devoted to ignoring everything and brainrotting so I don't go insane. I did not want to focus on something actively damaging my mood/emotions and affecting my friendships.

Thursday rolls around and I wake up same time as always but today I'm finished maybe 5 minutes before we usually leave, so I decide to just go ahead and leave. This was not planned in advance/premeditated, I simply saw an opportunity and the voices in my head said take it ig. After making it to class, I sit for a minute debating texting them something petty and eventually succumbed to the voices once again and send ""wouldn't want to make anyone late cause I stepped out of sight for a sec😅"". Margaret replies ""that's petty"" and so I said they hurt my feelings. This was their reply “You should’ve told us that then. We aren’t mind readers. We knew we needed to have extra time to walk and we needed to leave on time and hadn’t heard from you or seen you that morning. We didn’t mean to hurt your feelings we just wanted to get to class on time.”

Remember how I said Margaret was in the kitchen when I walked back from the bathroom? I just don't understand how they said they didn't hear or see me that morning when I used the bathroom and walked past one of them. They go on to say that they can usually hear when I'm awake (my alarms, me moving around, my dog) but that they didn't hear me this time. Margaret claims to have been in the kitchen for about 8 minutes before they left and didn't hear me. She has shit hearing and usually has earbuds in, there's no way she would've heard me over her music or show with how loud she listens to things w such bad hearing to begin with. They then say they noticed I hadn't been going to classes lately and had no way of knowing whether I was going today. I haven't missed a single tues/thurs class yet this semester besides one Tuesday where I missed my **afternoon** class because of something at work. On MWF Delilah and I have a 10am together. It is the most boring class I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing. I had to drop it the previous fall because I wasn't in the right mindset/mental place to actually attend class and pay attention. 

Now, I should mention I was recently diagnosed w sleep apnea and am getting the first good sleep in what is probably my entire life. I have a hard time waking up to alarms usually (it's getting better now that I'm getting oxygen to my brain while sleeping lol) so sometimes I don't wake up or (lately) wake up and immediately go back to sleep cause it's more important than a class I've already attended before. I'm paying for the class, he teaches directly out of the book, I do not care to miss a couple classes. 

So I had missed a scattering of days for this class, which Delilah knows about since we have it together. Them using this as an argument just further pissed me off as it's complete shit. 

There's a shit ton that's happened since; including me trying to talk to them immediately after, them getting pissy and ignoring me, them telling me they're not talking about it anymore (even tho we've barely talked about it at all, with them seemingly not listening to what I'm saying) and then them turning around and going to housing to schedule a mediation session, that doing nothing, and finally us not having talked since then and me getting new housing for next semester. 

I know this was super long winded and probably over/under detailed but with it now being December and it still bothering me since early October, I decided to bite the bullet and present it for public judgment. I've tried being open-minded and considered every single point they offered, but I still can't get over their original disrespect and refusal to own up to it even after I've apologized several times since for what I did, which I wasn't even expecting such a big reaction to to begin with. I thought our friendship was solid enough at this point to survive a couple bumps along the way but apparently the road was slick and we went careening off into the ditch full stop. 

I'd really appreciate any input anyone has on this. Even if you decide I'm the asshole, as long as it's constructive criticism I'd appreciate it.

# Chapter V

“… *Glory to you, Empire Eternal.*  
*Glory to the Homeworld and its Nations and its Martyrs.*  
*Glory to the Warriors, dauntless and defiant.*

*In life, Service*  
*In death, Sacrifice...”*

*- Terran litany*

Kainan sat in the pilot’s seat of the small interceptor, stormcloud eyes staring out into the swirling sea of geometric patterns out beyond the viewscreen, drawing impossible fractals upon the border of the artificial bubble of three-dimensional space that the Razor’s Edge resided in. Beyond that, separated only by a thin layer of tachyons and dark matter, lay Riftspace, that incomprehensible, multi-dimensional realm which existed beneath the surface of the normal universe. There, in Riftspace, the laws of geometry broke down and it was that property of this strange realm, which allowed ships to surpass the speed of light by simply diving into the Rift and shortening the travel distance. He knew, of course, that the fractals he was gazing at were not the true appearance of Riftspace, merely the way his mind interpreted a realm that was beyond mortal comprehension and no two individuals ever saw the same pattern. Right now, though, he didn’t really care, he simply found the fractals beautiful, in a soothing, mesmerizing way.

He had dismissed the overworked pilot and the navigator from their posts, ordering them to get some much-needed rest while he kept watch over the interceptor’s systems. While the ship was submerged into the Rift, its navigation systems did not require much input, so it was a monotonous and relatively simple task, which finally allowed him a few brief moments of respite. His thoughts raced, plotting, planning, calculating and categorizing deployment orders and supply lines, focused on the war to come, a war he knew would be on a scale not seen in more than twenty thousand years, when Houses Manticore and Kraken had fought over a resource-rich sector and the conflict escalated to involve all of their client species as well, leaving trillions dead and over a hundred worlds burned to ash. That *he* would be the architect of such devastation, weighed heavily upon his shoulders.

He felt her presence before he heard her speak. “Your people say such interesting things about you,” came that voice he’d come to know all too well by now, like birdsong and windchimes. Valyra’s voice. She sat into the copilot’s seat, pulling her slender legs under her as her aquamarine eyes drifted to the viewscreen and the swirling patterns beyond. Her nimble fingers cradled a mug of dark, steaming beverage and the smell of coffee filled the cockpit. Kainan lifted an eyebrow. “And what do they say?” he asked.

“They say the warlord never sleeps. That he always finds something to work on,” the princess responded, flashing him an impish smirk before lifting the mug to her lips, only for her features to then twist into a grimmace as she tasted the bitter beverage. Kainan shrugged. “They like to exaggerate,” he said, dismissively. “I’m just a man. A man with a plan, but at the end of the day, still just a man.”

The princess looked at him, sweeping her gaze over his frame, noticing the subtle tension in his shoulders, the tightness in his jaw. It was subtle, so subtle that most would have missed it. But not Valyra. To her, such things as easily readable as the letters in a book. She was Alvari, afterall, a species which had achieved unrivaled mastery over the body. More than that, she could sense his echo on the Veil, his psionic presence, still hidden and suppressed, but now unmistakable due to the bond they shared. “You are worried,” she said and it wasn’t a question, only a statement of fact.

He sighed, running a taloned hand over the rough stubble on his jaw. “I hold the lives of two hundred billion humans in my hands… not to mention all the other Pact species. I can’t afford to make mistakes, Valyra. *Any* mistakes, no matter how small,” he said, his stoic mask slipping to reveal just a hint of the tired man beneath, a man weighed down by a burden no individual should have to carry alone. It was a burden she, herself, knew all too well. “Shouldn’t you be resting, princess?” he tried to steer the conversation away from that topic, or any other things that threatened to wear down the barriers they had to keep between them. “You’re still recovering from your injuries.”

Her lips curled up into a smile as she fixed him with her gaze. “*You’re* one to talk, Kainan,” she snickered, a sound like crystal windchimes in a summer storm. She took another small, measured sip from her coffee. “Why are you humans so fond of this beverage? I heard the ship’s mechanic say he can not function without it,” quizzed Valyra, while giving the steaming mug in her hands a skeptical look. Kainan glanced at her, then at the cup of coffee in her hands. And then broke out into laughter, a rumbling, hearty laugh he couldn’t hold back. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep, or the sheer absurdity of the situation. There she was, one of the most powerful women in the galaxy, an accomplished diplomat and politician who’s reputation was notable even among her peers and she was talking to him about something as mundane as *coffee*.

Valyra’s brows curled into a puzzled frown and she tilted her head, the gesture almost avian, or perhaps feline, evidently confused by his reaction. The warlord leaned back into his seat. “You’re nothing like what I expected you to be, Valyra,” he said to her, offering her a warm smile that reached his eyes, a rarity for the usually stoic human. “And what did you expect me to be like?” the princess quizzed, a playful glint in her aquamarine eyes. “Perhaps a haughty, entitled royal who thinks the rest of the universe is beneath her and can’t string together two sentences that are not condescending?” She tilted her chin up, her features twisting into an expression of exaggerated imperiousness as she gave her best performance of exactly what she had described. *“Cease polluting my vision with your obnoxious presence, peasant!”*

“Well… *that*, yes,” Kainan answered with a shrug. “But you have this… hunger for life, as if you’re trying to find as much joy as you can in every little thing. Every time I see you, there’s a smirk or a smile on your features. It makes you… approachable, far more than I thought you would be.”

“Oh, I can be quite intimidating when I wish to be,” Valyra scoffed, taking another sip from her coffee despite her earlier skepticism regarding the Terran beverage. “But not everything has to be a formal exchange constrained by rank and pageantry and I am not so petty and insecure as to demand that everyone constantly grovel before me. That tends to be my brother’s preferred outlook, not mine…” she said, her shoulders slumping slightly as her thoughts drifted to her treacherous relative. Kainan did not press the issue, sensing the shift in her mood.

The princess drew in a deep breath, as if to banish the unpleasant topic from her thoughts. “You don’t exactly fit the stereotype of the human politician, either, Kainan. You don’t grovel or hide behind false platitudes and displays of deference. You are attuned to the Veil, yet you’ve managed to keep your abilities concealed even from me. You observe things others do not and don’t make rushed, emotional decisions,” she said as she measured him with a look. “You are a mystery wrapped in an enigma and you build so many walls around you, that I doubt even you know where they end.”

The warlord sighed, shoulders tensing, his gaze drifting into the distance as for a moment there, the mask of the indomitable leader shattered and a weary darkness settled into his eyes, the kind that suggested scars which were not physical in nature, but wrought by a lifetime of hardship. “I have a few too many ghosts haunting me, princess…” he answered in a low voice, almost a ragged whisper. “Buried a lot of good people, men and women who didn’t deserve the fate this galaxy wrought upon them.” He was so damned tired of it all, of the shadows which followed him, even though he knew he could never shed them. His was the kind of road that wound through the darkness, afterall.

Valyra’s expression softened. She reached out across the distance between them and placed her hand over his wrist, the touch gentle and feather-light. “We all have to live with the price of the choices we make, Kainan. Believe me, I understand the burdens you carry,” she said, her voice devoid of its usual light-hearted edge. She knew the enormity of the task he’d set himself to and just what it entailed. And through the bond they shared, she also knew there was more to his guarded outlook on life, than mere caution, though she refrained from touching upon that, opting instead to steer the conversation away from topics that were becoming a bit too sensitive and a bit too personal. “That emblem you wear, what does it mean?”

Some of the tension faded from the warlord’s shoulders and he gave her a look of gratitude as he answered, lifting a taloned finger to the crimson-and-white pin on the collar of his shirt. “Duty. Discipline. Loyalty,” he said as he pointed to each of the three inward-facing spears that bisected the flat sides of the triangle. Then, he pointed to the three corners, each forming a stylized arrowhead facing outwards from the center. “Resilience. Honor. Purpose. The first three, are the principles which hold the Terran Empire together. The latter, are the values which the Empire aims to manifest. Together, they embody the guiding philosophy of our nation and the greatest traits of our species. They come together to form a triangle, the strongest shape in geometry, representing our unwavering commitment to achieve a better future.”

The princess nodded approvingly, measuring his words with the same degree of attentiveness she awarded everything else she deemed of importance. “Your ideals are as lofty as your ambitions,” she said with a warm smile, then gave his wrist another squeeze, drawing his gaze down to the point of contact. Seeing her smile like that, he broke into a grin. He didn’t know why, didn’t understand it, but he couldn’t help himself. There was something contagious about her smile, something that made him feel things he hadn’t felt in a long time. Those simple joys he only knew briefly, before they were snatched away from him by fate’s cruel hand. He found himself taking in every little detail, the way her eyes lit up, how she could say a thousand things with just a glance, her melodious voice which reminded him of windchimes, her full lips…

… The feeling of her soft skin against his as her lithe, nimble fingers closed around his calloused hand. It was all so… incredibly intoxicating, distracting in a way that was dangerous. Her touch lingered, far beyond the point it should have and he had not found the will to withdraw, either. The tension between them was almost palpable and he wasn’t sure at which point the line had been crossed from political alliance to whatever this was, but he felt drawn to her in a way far more than he should and he knew, through the psionic bond they shared, that she felt the same. Worse yet, she could tell *exactly* what thoughts were warring in his mind and he had no way of concealing them. The bond worked both ways, afterall. At some point, this matter would have to be addressed, before they found themselves blindly crossing another, even more serious line, one they both knew there would be no coming back from. But that would have to come later, when they could both think with more clarity than the aftermath of their flight from the station afforded them. For now, though… they would allow eachother this one, small indulgence.

A sudden metallic groan and a shudder tore the warlord from his restless, dreamless slumber. Aboard the small interceptor, an angry alarm blared and the lighting in the cockpit changed from neutral white, to the angry dark red of combat condition and the viewport lit up with a series of alerts indicating the collapse of the hyperdimensional field around the vessel and its subsequent unceremonious ejection back into realspace. The Razor’s Edge had been yanked out of Riftspace by something and the reason was displayed in angry red letters upon the viewscreen: *an interdiction field*.

The jarring sound of glassware shattering upon the deck plates drew his gaze to the left, only to notice that Valyra had bolted upright, accidentally knocking her half-finished coffee mug off of the armrest. It seemed both he and the princess had dozed off in their seats, but the unfolding situation banished their slumber and instincts born from a lifetime of combat training and experience, had replaced any hint of drowsiness with the cold alertness of warriors on the verge of battle.

“Sir? What’s the situation?” came another voice from behind them, lieutenant Asami Ishida’s voice, the commanding officer of the small interceptor, a no-nonsense woman of short stature, with black hair tied back into a simple ponytail. “Interdiction field,” Kainan said as he stood up from the pilot’s seat to let her take his place at the helm, for while he might have been a decent pilot, that was not his area of expertise and he wasn’t arrogant enough to stand in the way of the professionals. “Gorgon frigate, by the looks of it,” he said grimly. Gorgons were one of the other civilizations subjugated by the Dra’var’th, a species of stocky, hairless creatures with a flat face, pointy ears and bone-white, leathery features dominated by a single eye. Unlike most of the species under the whip of the Dragon House, however, the Gorgons had taken to their new role surprisingly well, their natural inclinations towards obedience, greed and brutality making them the perfect mercenaries to do the demons’ dirty work.

He stepped back and grabbed an overhead handrail as the rest of the crew filed in, the Alvari princess somehow appearing at his side, holding on to his other arm for support. Hands flying over the controls, the Lieutenant let out a string of what Kainan assumed to be profanities in Japanese, the language of her long-dead homeland, back on Earth-That-Was, a language that was now increasingly rare, just like Terran English and a lot of other once-prominent homeworld tongues. Had Kainan been able to afford the time to contemplate such matters, he would have lamented the gradual fading of the old cultures and traditions of the homeworld, but alas, there was a battle to consider.

It was evident what had happened. The Dra’var’th had evidently been preparing for the purge of Utopia Station for some time and they’d had their dogs lie in wait to ambush any potential survivors that managed to escape. That they knew the route the Razor’s Edge had taken, meant an intelligence leak he’d have to address later, if they survived the current situation, for a single deep space interceptor, while nimble and heavily armed in its own right, was no match for a frigate. “Can you get us clear of the interdiction field and translate back to Riftspace?” he asked the lieutenant as she banked hard to the left to dodge out of the way of a salvo of plasma bolts from the enemy vessel. “Negative, sir. They’re five million kilometers out and that field extends nearly double that distance. We’ll never clear it before their fighters get within combat range.”

Kainan nodded. “Where do you need me, Lieutenant,” he asked, years of combat experience taking over. “Ramirez didn’t make it off the station, so I’m a gunner short,” the lieutenant answered. “Need someone to man the secondaries, job’s yours if you can handle the turret controls.”

The warlord nodded. “Valyra, I need you to get back to the medbay and keep everyone calm,” he said as he strapped himself into the gunnery seat and locked the harness around himself. “Make sure to find a cot or a crash seat and fasten yourself down, this is going to get bumpy.” Valyra nodded and strode out of the cockpit with her typical effortless grace. Through the bond, he could sense her frustration and her desire to help, but while the princess might be a very competent warrior and tactician herself, she had no experience with human ship systems and their controls and she was not the kind of woman who’s pride would keep her from acknowledging that.

As the princess left, the cockpit descended into a scene of organized chaos. Alarms blared indicating a missile lock and screens flashed with alerts and sensor readouts. “Hostile strike craft inbound, two million kilometers out, bearing two-two-three by seven-niner!” called the copilot, a grizzled old veteran with a face that looked like it had been chewed up by a mining rig. “Incoming antimatter missile!”

That was all Kainan needed to hear. His hands flew over the controls of the gunnery station, his genetically-engineered brain running the necessary calculations as he input the results. The interceptor banked right, then corkscrewed into a dive, giving the warlord a mere fraction of a second to react. It was all he needed. He input the final command and the small vessel’s twin autocannon turrets popped out from beneath their hatches, firing three short bursts. The first one went wide, but the second burst clipped the missile, sending it veering off-course and a third burst caused it to bloom into a blinding white nova. “Brace for sensor overload!” he called out, with seconds to spare before the EMP blast reached them. “Adjust for interference and compensate for gamma ray burst!”

“Switching to manual!” lieutenant Ishida shouted as she flicked a control switch on her console while the enemy fighters closed in. The Razor’s Edge switched from the automated inertial control system to old-school chemical reaction control, thrusters firing in rapid sequence as the experienced pilot maneuvered the interceptor to weave around a burst of plasma bolts, then drift sideways past the first two enemy fighters. The interceptor’s main battery, a twin-barreled 90mm railgun housed in the overhead turret located behind the cockpit, swiveled and fired, the loud thud echoing across the Edge as its hull shuddered from the recoil. Tungsten darts raced across the void and impacted, turning the first enemy strike craft into a cloud of rapidly-expanding microscopic particles as the force of the projectiles simply shattered it. A long burst from Kainan’s autocannons shredded the second fighter, but not before it managed to spew out a volley of plasma bolts which slammed into the Edge’s shields.

“Shields at sixty! Diverting power from non-essential systems!” the ship’s engineer announced as the lieutenant executed another turn so sharp that the inertial dampeners couldn’t fully compensate for. Kainan hoped everyone was strapped in safely, because the sudden acceleration was definitely powerful enough to throw someone against a bulkhead with enough force to break bones. The twin-barreled railgun fired again in rapid succession, cycling each round, causing another enemy indicator to disappear from the sensors, while his wingmate veered sharply to evade, Kainan’s autocannons laying down a curtain of suppressive fire that forced it to break formation and slam into a piece of debris from one of the other fighters, rupturing a fuel line and briefly transforming into a blazing torch that spun uncontrollably away.

Another salvo of high-powered plasma bolts from the frigate sizzled past the interceptor with a mere dozen meters to spare. Ishida responded by flipping the interceptor a hundred and eighty degrees and firing the axial, the hundred and fifty millimeter dart forcing the enemy capital ship to change its position in order to evade. The situation did not look good. At a distance of four million kilometers, the Gorgon frigate was safely out of the effective range of the interceptor’s railguns, having enough distance to accelerate away before the projectiles speared its unshielded hull. If they could get close enough, they might stand a chance at disabling it, for while the Gorgons possessed plasma weaponry that was centuries ahead of anything fielded by humanity, their defenses were vastly more primitive, lacking even the most basic shielding capabilities. A frigate such as the one they were facing, was a glass cannon, one which even a patrol group of Terran corvettes would have no problems dispatching, but between its plasma batteries and its strike craft complement, it was more than a match for the single interceptor, even with lieutenant Ishida’s exceptional piloting skills.

“Hostiles converging from multiple vectors!” called the copilot. It was a multi-pronged attack, a fairly standard tactic among most species’ space forces, basic, yet extremely effective. Lieutenant Ishida wasted no time, she flicked a switch and opened one of the interceptor’s missile ports. “Nuke away!” she called out as the rocket darted towards a pair of enemy fighters that were further away, while she sent the Razor’s Edge into an uncontrolled spin to try to shake off the enemy target locks. Plasma bolts seared the void around the interceptor, several of them bursting through the shields to clip one of its wings. “Hull breach! We have a fire in engineering and we’ve lost artificial gravity!” called the engineer as he unstrapped himself from his seat and maneuvered back towards the rear of the ship. The power surge from the failure of the shields and the impact of the plasma bolts must have caused a cascading failure in several of the interceptor’s systems.

“Warlord, I need you to get yourself and the princess to the escape pod!” Ishida barked out. “Belay that!” answered Kainan. “You have wounded personnel, medics and civilians aboard this ship, they should be the ones getting into that escape pod with Valyra!”

“Don’t argue with me, sir!” Ishida retorted without glancing back at him. “Without you, this whole war is lost before it even begins!” The warlord grit his teeth and hissed in frustration, his fists clenching so hard that the artificial claws implanted into the tips of his fingers, pierced the calloused, scarred flesh of his palms. As much as he hated to admit it, the lieutenant was right. The Empire needed its leader, not a martyr.

With a growl of pure frustration, he unstrapped himself from his seat and pushed himself out of the cockpit just as another jolt slammed him into one of the bulkheads. Kainan felt his ribs crack and blood seeped out of a cut on his temple, the small crimson globs drifting around in the lack of gravity. He gritted his teeth through the pain and pulled himself along by the handrails, sparing only a single glance back towards the cockpit. “Lieutenant, if you survive this, I’m giving you a promotion and a battlecarrier,” he called out. “Which battlecarrier?” Ishida barked back, a feral grin on her normally severe features. “The newest one. The Agamemnon,” said Kainan. “So make sure to make it out of here alive. That’s an order, *captain!*”

He didn’t wait to hear her answer, making his way through the interceptor’s corridors and finding the princess already unstrapping herself from the crash seat she’d seated herself on in the small mess hall, as if she had already sensed his intentions. She probably had, given the bond they now shared and her expression was as grim as his own. Wordlessly, he took her hand and guided her to the escape pod, helping her fasten herself into the safety harness before turning back to look for more passengers, only to find the hatch sliding shut in his face, locking him in. Ishida must have overridden it from the cockpit. Knowing there was nothing else he could do, he let out a frustrated growl and strapped himself in with moments to spare, as the escape pod shot out of the dying interceptor with a sickening lurch. The staccato hissing of maneuvering thrusters reverberated across the hull as the pod aligned itself towards the nearest asteroid belt, which lay roughly seventy million kilometers from their current position, then he and the princess were pressed into their seats as the main engine fired and the pod accelerated towards its destination.

Upon getting to the house, i noticed they made some changes to it?

most notably, to me at least, the 2 rooms upstairs. they seem smaller, and the furniture is different now? the list of changes i noticed :

* the lattice on the side of the porch. less damage then before, the opening is tiny and you cant target the ghoul with vats until he crawls out.
* the ghoul in the back now spawns underneath/inside the picnic table
* the couch and chairs around the umbrella table are rearranged 
* there is now a coffee table with the blue lamp on it when you walk through the front door
* the red couch is kind of squished, and barely any space between it and the tv stand. no coffee table against the wall between them
* upstairs room on the left, no leaning bureau, or upended book shelf, and green footlocker is no longer on the floor, but on a short book shelf.
* upstairs room on the right now has a bureau on the west wall next to the desk, desk is smaller

it feels like parts of it were condensed, like the room dimensions are off and stuff is much closer together. the furniture differences were more obvious as i looked around, but it all looks a little off.

im curious what/where else has changed, im guessing adding the new map expansion must have caused a bunch of resizing in other areas.

  
so has anyone else noticed any changes like this to locations they frequent in game, and what are those changes? ",1,1764808244.0,fo76,0,0.67,False

1pdlfxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1pdlfxj/excellence_riviera_cancun_review/,Excellence Riviera Cancun Review,"

I found these reviews helpful when I was looking for a resort.

My husband and I just returned from a wonderful and relaxing stay at the Excellence Riviera Cancun. We are not normally resort travellers but really enjoyed our trip.  
  
The Room  
We had a swim up in building 4. The building is a bit of a walk from the reception and restaurants but the paths are beautiful and well maintained. We appreciated this as we could only distantly hear the bass from the disco nights, I imagine buildings 1 and 6 which are closer would be louder. Our room was spacious and as expected. Housekeeping was excellent as was the restocking service (which we tipped separately). We tried to get a dehumidifier but none were available during our stay so we left the AC on which got rid of the humidity. Our daybed had morning sun and afternoon shade.  
  
The Food  
The food went from okay to great. Highlights were the breakfast buffet and the French restaurant. The portions are small but we appreciated that as we could each get apps, mains, sides, and still have room for desert. We never had long waits for dinner but often went early. We did the Teppenyaki at the Asian restaurant but would not recommend for those with shellfish allergies. We had a few not great meals (particularly the beef sandwiches at the Kitchen Table were exceptionally greasy) but nothing inedible. Drinks were always excellent and varied. They have plenty of off menu cocktails as well so you can order whatever you want. The service at all the bars was great and the day bed service both at our room and around the lazy river was top notch everyday! Special shout out to the coffee shop which had the most delicious deserts and the smoothie bar where we would grab morning refreshments.  
  
The Entertainment  
I really liked aquafit and tried to make it everyday! We also tried the air rifle shooting and eco-tour (which was pretty sad as an eco-tour but solid as a tequila tasting). I also did a nice yoga class. In the evenings we enjoyed the kaeroke, trivia, and silent discos. The resort does shut down early (shows done at 11, last bar at midnight) but we appreciated that as it made it very restful. I am typically a night-owl but appreciated being up around 7 to enjoy the most of each day and then to bed early. People were friendly and if you wanted a conversation over your drink it was easy to find, however there were plenty of quiet places where no one would bother you, so ultimately pretty good for an introvert/extrovert couple.  
  
The Grounds  
The resort is beautiful and kept well. The beach is pleasant and had limited sargassum that they were constantly cleaning. A huge plus for us was that you could always find a lounger wherever you wanted to sit. We don't like to camp out in one place all day and appreciated that we didn't have to play the chair game. That said, if you want a day bed by the pool bar I would tell you to be out there by 6 AM. There are some mosquitoes around dawn and dusk but I used bug spray and we were not very bothered.  
  
The resort is close to Puerto Morelos. It was a 60 to 120 peso Uber each way depending on the day. We went twice to grab forgotten toiletries and souvenirs to avoid the extremely expensive in resort gift shop. You can also walk along the beach to get to town and they do daily bicycle rides but we never took one.   
  
Overall we were very happy with our stay and had a relaxing restful time like we had hoped. We would return to this resort happily.  ",4,1764807980.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,0.83,False

The furniture, the music, the people talking at the counter, nothing really seemed worth the energy she severly lacked to invest. After all it wasn't exactly relaxing to drive across almost the whole country to work a case she felt the local police should have handled. All of this felt like it was a demotion, even if it wasn't, at least not on paper.

As she took a sip from the coffee right in front of her she felt some energy coming back into her system. The batch this had come from probably was as old as the diner itself, but at least it gave her the caffein she craved. This influx of energy was enough to increase her attentiveness to the point where she registered the question directed at her by the deputy sitting in front of her. 

""So, uhm... I can't help but to notice you're alone? Don't you Feds work in duos? Like do we have to wait for a partner of yours or...?""

Usually she'd have flipped at such a question, but her tiredness as well as the fact he probably didn't mean it in a disrespectful way made her answer calmly, though not happily.

""No I'm by myself. The bureau didn't really consider this to be of great importance given that this is an open and shut case. Me being here is more of a formalilty.""

He shifted in his seat, seemingly nervous for no apparent reason. Eventually he leaned forward and kept his voice down as he said something that would change everything about Jessica's involvement with this case.

""And what if... it's not that open and shut? I mean... some things just aren't adding up here and... I know I'm just a deputy but...""

He looked over his shoulder at the diner guests at the counter that in turn eyed them up as well.

""This can't be as simple as the file may suggest miss.""

Jessica felt a sudden rush of energy. Perhaps this wasn't a demotion after all, even if it clearly had been planned as one. If there was just a sliver of hope that this could be a case actually worth investigating thoroughly she could return back home with glory instead of frustration. There was no way this deputy had spotted something that the comission hadn't when they gave the case to the FBI, but she didn't really have any other choice than to smile at him and say as nicely as possible:

""Well then deputy Smith, shall we perhaps get into your theory?""

Clearly he was taken aback by the fact someone was actually willing to hear him out rather than shutting it down immediately. 

""Uhm... yeah sure! But..."" he looked around a bit nervously again, ""let's go to the station so that we can talk freely without any potential eavesdropping...""

Hi there, hope you're doing good today :) i had the idea of a mysterious case for a detective to solve! I felt particularly inspired by twin peaks and disco elysium, though none of them are any prerequisites to this roleplay! As a matter of fact I also wanted to try out a different approach to this as well. If you're interested I'd suggest that I will not tell you the story upfront, or at least not the full story, especially not the resolution of the mystery. That way you can experience this case like the detective herself.

1pdl9tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1pdl9tx/dream_transatlantic_vs_treasure/,Dream (transatlantic) vs Treasure,"Cruise newbies here. We tentatively booked on the Treasure for our first cruise a few months ago and surprised ourselves by how much we loved it overall. We chose it due to a) 7 nights - we wanted a real taste of what it was like, and b) theming - loved the colours, Haunted Mansion etc. 

We booked a placeholder on the ship and then disembarked and booked for the transatlantic - because we absolutely loved sea days and we felt we could deal with the things we didn’t like so much. We are both introverted readers who have busy jobs, and we mostly just enjoyed not being connected, and kicking back on the verandah with books and wine. 

We are slightly concerned the Dream will be not as nice since it’s older and smaller, so I would love to hear some experiences from others comparing both if you’ve done them. 

What we loved (besides the above): 
Drawing classes (loved getting in the zone),
Bingo (surprisingly fun),
Beauty & the Beast stage show (wow!),
The coffee shops (mid-ship, we never made it to The Cove),
The bars (mostly for theming; felt they were small),
Top deck food (though we would have liked the option of sandwiches etc. also), marceline market, room service,
Palo Steakhouse and Enchante (we did both for dinner, and we are foodies),
Pixie dusting and fish extenders,
Split bathrooms,
Gelato,
Disney vibes,
Castaway. 

What we didn’t love: 
Main dining rotation food was mostly terrible. Appetizers and soup/salad courses were fine and some desserts were okay but without exception the mains were awful (we were only due to go five times because of the paid-for reservations but only ended up going three times - we took room service chicken tenders over facing going back),
How small and cramped a lot of the bars were - really hard to get in lots of times,
Endless queues for food/shows etc. It was okay, but I wasn’t expecting it to be as bad as it was,
Some of our wait staff (some were amazing and we tipped/left compliments accordingly. Did not appreciate the very long lecture only a couple of days in about rating them as excellent in the service else their family would suffer!),
The crazy expensive high end stores that seemed to take up a lot of space (the normal gift stores were excellent), 
Adult only area top deck- we passed through it once. Didn’t see anything remotely relaxing about being cramped up there. And it was really hard to find. 

Thanks in advance!

1pdl9qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pdl9qy/aita_for_feeding_birds_after_my_citizenship/,AITA for feeding birds after my citizenship ceremony and making my fiancé’s mum “wait” for lunch?,"A few days ago, I (30F) had my citizenship ceremony. It’s a big deal for me after 14 years here, but my parents couldn’t come because my mum is waiting for a serious surgery, so I invited my fiancé (33M) and his mum. We planned to go to a park afterwards to see the peacocks and feed the birds, which is honestly my biggest passion and something that’s helped me mentally through a really rough year. Then we were supposed to go for lunch.

At the park, we stopped a few times to feed birds and squirrels. His mum seemed to enjoy it and kept taking photos. My fiancé, though, slowly started walking ahead like he was bored, and eventually his mum followed him while I stayed behind feeding the animals. Then a squirrel suddenly bit me when I was hand feeding it. It shocked me because it never happened before. My finger started bleeding.

Right at that moment my fiancé came down the little hill and snapped at me saying his mum was hungry and that I’m “starving” her. His tone totally caught me off guard. I was trying to quickly Google what to even do about a squirrel bite, but he kept telling me to go somewhere else in the park to deal with the wound and started raising his voice. I honestly just froze because I needed a minute to calm down, but he kept pushing and it overwhelmed me and I ended up crying.

We eventually found a toilet to clean the cut. His mum just waited outside. My fiancé came into the ladies bathroom and tried to sort of help, but he was very cold and still irritated, which just made me cry more. I needed a plaster but said we could get one at the restaurant so his mum could eat sooner. He walked out annoyed.

When I came out after calming down, I saw his mum sitting on a bench. She barely asked why I was upset and then basically changed the subject. My fiancé came back with a coffee and a little cake… for her. Nothing for me, not even the plaster.

We walked to the restaurant and I was still upset because none of it was sorted. His mum just talked like nothing happened.

Later that night when we tried to talk about it, he said I treated them horribly, that I was stupid and “brain dead” for wanting to talk to her. He said his mum told him she wasn’t happy and that I didn’t let them go because I stopped to feed the birds. He even said he didn’t want to marry me if this is “how I treat his mum.”

Around midnight I felt awful and couldn’t sleep, so I wanted to go for a walk. His mum saw me crying and I apologised, saying I didn’t realise she was hungry and that I lose track of time when I’m feeding the birds. She told me it was fine and that the day was about me, and that her son is just very “sensitive” about her.

The next day I tried to clear the air again but she brushed everything off and wouldn’t really let me explain anything. My fiancé told me to “shut up” while apologising to her for me making her uncomfortable.

I honestly don’t know anymore.

1pdl69i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pdl69i,Favorite duo of a morally grey visionary & a fiercely loyal right hand who outlives them?,"One of my favourite character dynamics! What are your most beloved examples of that? Here are mine:

**Erwin Smith and Levi Ackermann - Attack on Titan.**

Erwin was the best military leader Paradis have seen and his secret was that, unlike other commanders, he waged a war for his own hidden purposes and not for the greater good. He left a pile of corpses and succeeded where others failed because his reasons were more individual.

Levi was a street thug with great talent; Erwin saw that talent and decided to give him a second chance at life, where this talent would be utilised. Under Erwin's wings Levi became humanity's strongest soldier and it was him who, in the final hour, convinced Erwin to give up his selfish ambitions and finish the work he's accidently done for humanity along the way, in exchange for a promise.

Then, Levi failed at immidietly fullfilling that promise, which nearly broke him. For the rest of the show he has just one mission: to fullfill the promise. He fights for it until it's done, changing from the humanity's strongest soldier to a one-eyed wheelchair-bound veteran with severe PTSD.

**Hurrem and Sumbul - Magnificent Century**

Hurrem and Sumbul used to be enemies - when she was brought to the sultan's palace as a slave concubine, she acted out against customs he was supposed to enforce as the main harem agha. Even after she'd became a favourite, he was still very much against her, as well as when the sultan married her, because this was a peak of ignoring customs, and customs were his life.

Until one day he finally realised there was no victory against her and no customs were worth fighting her. He switched sides to gain advantage, but in time the two of them became friends. After years of his service she set him free and became a frequent customer of his café. He'd supply her with coffee even after the sultan's decision to ban it.

Finally, Sumbul was the first one to learn about her incurable disease. He broke his oath of silence about it and told the sultan, for which she grew to hate him and banished him. Fortunatelly they reconciled once again, shortly before her death.

**Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell - Wolf Hall**

Wolsey took Cromwell to his service upon a recommendation and quickly bonded with him, both of them being of a low birth and operating among nobility. The cardinal was a ruthless politician who always strove to achieve greater good, but did many questionable things along the way. He made a lot of enemies and one day they succeeded in turning the king against him.

With his master banished, Cromwell did all he could to gain favor of the king to reinstall Wosey in his old position. He kept refusing to visit the cardinal in exile, afraid that their enemies would take advantage of his abstence, even though Wolsey begged for him. One day he received the news of his master's death, and he turned his guilt into hatred for those who caused the banishment.

He succeeded in killing them all, until there was only one man to blame: himself. His guilt caught up with him years after. He'd become an important statesman by then, but his arrogance led him astray and in the end he fell out of grace, just like Wolsey. He'd finally forgiven himself on the scaffold, right before an axe fell on his neck.

I also thought of including **Qui Gon Jinn & Obi Wan Kenobi from Star Wars** and **Jon Snow & Samwell Tarly from A Song of Ice and Fire**, but the dynamics is slightly different in both cases; Obi Wan was Qui Gon's student more than a right hand and Jon Snow is not entirely dead. Still I think these relationships have some similarities to the three above.

1pdl551,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1pdl551/oocs_of_dog_volpir_and_man_bk_8_ch_62/,"OOCS: Of Dog, Volpir, and Man - Bk 8 Ch 62","Jerry 

The land around them is rich and verdant, a mix of golden plains and green jungle, the heart of where Cannidor had once evolved… and now it’s been selected by the Golden Khan as the battleground for the great challenge. It’s a deep honor... and if anything, another advantage for the Humans, as far as Jerry’s concerned. 

Cannidor don't really do camouflage in the traditional warrior castes, and Halgret is reportedly fairly straight-laced, despite her alleged underhanded dealings with the Black Khans. 

The preparation for something as straightforward as a unit on unit training exercise had been exceptionally elaborate; this is full-on ritual combat, given that possession of territory was at stake. It’s the Cannidor proper, formal approach.  

‘Informal’ would more likely involve forcing a battle barge into orbit, challenging the local Khan's garrison, and hot-dropping on their asses and going at it till someone cried uncle. 

What Humans would call the 'pre-game' has been rather involved. It had begun with a reading of the terms of engagement and an establishment of the various rules. This had been followed by a blessing from a shaman. 

The blessing had been a long one in its own right, an invocation of courage and strength for all participating warriors, but also a baleful curse the likes of which Jerry had never heard outside of a fantasy novel before. To act disgracefully on this sacred ground wouldn’t just fail your honor, or the honor of your clan, or even the honor of your ancestors. No. This was the birth place of the Cannidor: to disgrace yourself here of all places, was to disgrace yourself before all Cannidor to have ever been, and who would ever be, and the gods themselves. 

It was certainly an impressive way to demand fair play, at the very least. 

Next, while they were all processing what they’d heard, came a detailed inspection to ensure everyone's equipment had been properly set up for less lethal work - under the careful supervision of the Golden Khan's personal forge mistress. 

Then came the feast, which they’re still enjoying now. 

Per the rules they'd concluded with the Charocan, later agreed on by the Halgret (without the latter women paying too much attention), the fighting day would start at dawn, as per Cannidor tradition for ritual combat…

*All the better for the gods to see you* is the idea as far as Jerry understands it. 

… but the battle would be formally joined earlier, at midnight. 

Now, Khan Halgret is an idiot, but she isn't *that* stupid. Even if she missed that little flutter in the rules, one of her people would certainly see it and point it out. So she'd be expecting an early attack during the night... which is why they weren't going to be doing that. 

Jerry grins to himself as he rips a chunk of meat off some animal bone or another with his teeth, like a barbarian warlord instead of the admiral of a fleet of star-going vessels that could deliver orbital assaults anywhere in the galaxy with minimal support required. 

They'd keep the Halgret forces busy tonight, with a small squad of volunteers going out and harassing their sentries - not even using force, just making noise and forcing the enemy camp to go on alert, or send out patrols. When the traditional fighting day is due to begin, the commandos would then hit them when they were nice and tired. 

It was the oldest playbook available for modern special forces operations back home. 

A strike at zero hour, midnight, is the traditional timing, but whenever the enemy’s degraded in some way and you had cover would do.

Some of the men have been making it a point to mingle with the Halgret troops, specifically the girls who hadn’t yet earned their power armor; Khan Halgret most assuredly doesn't seem to appreciate the visitors and their banter, snapping at her girls now and then, and inevitably driving the commandos back to their side of the feast... usually having left communicator id numbers in their wake. 

All's fair in love and war, after all; Jerry would be highly amused if he got a few more Cannidor soldiers out of this particular scuffle. 

It'd make defeating Khan Halgret all the sweeter, really. 

As the feast goes on and the fires burn low, one by one the commandos vanish from their main camp, leaving Cannidor from the crew, the Golden Khan's forces and Halgret's troops to drink and make merry... with slightly less eye candy on offer. 

The commandos slink through the jungle to the area they'd selected for their hidden bivouac, and after gearing up, set watches and bed down. 

Jerry hadn't had to do anything. Nor had Sir David.

Everyone knows the plan. 

Everyone’s ready. 

Jerry grins again as he slowly starts to armor himself up. The cases for their armor and weapons would teleport back to the base camp for later use as soon as they signaled, all the better to minimize their signature. 

He takes his time as he locks each piece into place over the jumpsuit he'd had on underneath his fatigues. This is a new piece of equipment for Admiral Bridger, after all. He famously has power armor, he has his hard suit - but this is the special stealth gear that the ship's commandos use as their first line of equipment: a lighter version of the hard suit with all sorts of special materials and systems. 

Jerry pulls a forearm guard back off after checking himself over, taking a moment to tuck a kerchief Chaisa had given him as a ‘token’, prompted by Bari no doubt who had done the same before Jerry’s duel with Aqi back on Serbow. Chaisa had asked for and been promised a date in the near future. Something to look forward to, but that something was on the other side of both the Halgret, and the Black Khans.

A journey the stealth suit would most certainly help him make. Or at least it better, the things are damned expensive, fit specifically to their wearers, and they’re incredibly potent tools so far as Jerry knows. He'd certainly heard Neysihen and Purisha rave about them at length, including the suit's ability to do what it needed to with nothing more than a whisper of axiom, just passively drinking from the environment instead of sucking in power from a battery or high-end power armor reactor. 

Signature-wise, the Undaunted stealth suits would be like a Christmas tree light next to a super nova, with all the power armor in the vicinity. 

They’d also been given a slight cosmetic change just for this fight. 

A Cannidor junior reporter commenting on Undaunted combat performance during the Hag war had referred to the commandos as ‘Khan Bridger’s Bloody Red Right Hand’ after contacting the Crimson Tear’s public relations departments and getting some footage from one of their raids. 

The young lady in question had since been offered a job on the Tear and, for this one battle, JSOC’s elite warriors had decided to embrace the pageantry. Every right gauntlet in the company except Jerry’s was painted a bloody red. 

Depending on who you asked, it was either a handicap or a warning - but if they did this right, Halgret’s forces wouldn’t get a chance to appreciate the paint job till they were ‘dead’. 

He does a final self-check of his gear, then quietly has Isabella check him before he checks her, and finally both of them are checked over by one of the full time commandos. They'd gone on to a very different line of work after all with the power armor battalion, and it wouldn't do to have 'old friends' look silly for their first time out in the field in a while. 

He paces the camp, checking the sentries and conferring with team leaders, before returning to his hammock, and gently lowering himself into its embrace. 

Just a quick cat nap...

It feels like his eyes have only been closed for a few seconds when Isabella shakes him awake. He rolls out of his hammock, shakes himself a bit, and automatically takes the mug of coffee that had been passed to him. 

The moon’s still high, but dawn's fire would be turning the horizon pink -not that they could tell in the green depths of the jungle. 

""Anything to report from the sentries?""

""No, sir,"" Emma Forsythe responds, her tone slightly clipped. She isn't angry or anything, near as Jerry could tell; this is just her 'working face'. 

""Everyone got at least some shut eye?""

""Yes, sir. I relieved the last watch myself.""

""Excellent work, Major Forsythe. I can see JSOC is in good hands.""

Emma sticks her chest out a bit more, standing a bit straighter, more parade ground than in the field for a moment.

""Thank you, sir.""

""I believe you're with me, Emma. Let's go find Isabella and the rest of our crew and step off... I want to be in position to watch the show, and I want to find a good opportunity to take out Khan Halgret as early as possible. The harder we hit them, the better the Cannidor will know exactly what a Human is, and I aim for our people to be well understood by our new friends.""

There's no cheer in response. This is a commando camp, not a briefing room or a bunch of normal grunts, after all. These men and two women are all professionals, the best of the best on and off Earth. 

For all their efforts, this is, for all intents and purposes, Human special operations public debut; stakes and spirits would be high even without three inhabitable worlds on the line for Human colonies. 

""Break camp, and move out. It's time to put the galaxy on notice."" 

Jerry locks his helmet into place and activates the axiom purge system, rendering the armor almost entirely inert as he does the same to his own body. He runs a little hotter axiom-wise than most Humans, a consequence of mastering Apuk war fire, which means he’s going to be hanging back and commanding his troops instead of going in with the first wave. 

Pairs and fire teams, plan and orders memorized, break down their hammocks or tents, get their gear tucked away, and vanish into the depths of the jungle. Some go into the brush, and others up the trees as Humanity's ancestors once had. 

Before long, Jerry and his little entourage do the same, and all that’s left of the bivouac is a little matted grass and a few cut branches. 

The commandos are on the move.

I Can Prove it…","Back in 2020 during covid when CBS was running reruns of Y&R I found myself enjoying the reruns more so than current episodes. 

This was so jarring to me that I decided to write a letter to the show. I ended up with a 4 page single space letter that I emailed and sent via postal mail. 

I am throughly convinced someone important read that letter because much of what I suggested was incorporated into the show. Those of you who are Y&R viewers tell me we didn’t see some of my suggestions put into the show. 

I kept that letter. I refer to it often. Here is that letter…

June 12, 2020

The Young & The Restless
7800 Beverly Blvd
Los Angeles, California 90036

To Whom It May Concern:

My name is “redacted”. Everyone who knows me calls me “redacted.” I am a thirty-five-year-old African American woman born and raised in Georgia. For thirty of my thirty-five years I have been a devoted fan of your show, The Young & The Restless. 

You may not be aware of this (or maybe you are aware and don’t care) African American women are a core demographic of your viewing audience. We watch your show faithfully, and we have supported your show for decades. Our mothers and grandmothers have been instrumental in passing down a love for “the stories” to my generation. My generation hopes to pass down “the stories” to our daughters and granddaughters as our mothers and grandmothers did before us. With that said, neither I nor anyone I know, feels represented or acknowledged by the writers and producers of The Young & The Restless. 

In the years I’ve been watching this show I have watched one after another back from the dead story, baby switch story, newly discovered twin story, good girl falls for bad boy story, and everything in-between. Rarely have any of these stories involved your core black family, and rarely are these stories believable and relatable. 

After spending the last few weeks watching your “classic” episodes there is no doubt in my mind this show is a shadow of its former self. Romance, suspense, cliff-hangers, and betrayals have been thrown under the bus for storylines that feature the same old stale plots with characters that lack development. 

There was a point when soaps used to be at the forefront of realistic drama dealing with social issues of the day. Women, regardless of race and background, could watch stories about rape, domestic violence, love, betrayal etc., and be drawn completely into the plot and characters. This is no longer the case. Quality writing, character development, and plot development are non-existent on this show. For these reasons, and many more, I have decided to write this letter in hopes that someone will actually read it, and listen to a long-time fan. 

There are several issues with the show. The first being one of the most striking: the opening credits. Please go back to the 1990s version of the opening credits, which featured the actors looking their best and floating towards the viewers with a white background behind them. The Bold & The Beautiful finally got a clue and reverted back to what worked best—their original opening credits. I suggest you revert back to the opening credits of the 1990s. 

In addition to the above, the opening scenes for each episode need to begin with the theme music. The music should start playing during the opening scenes, and flow into the opening credits. This helps viewers anticipate the drama to come.

Next, the sets on this show need to be overhauled. There are too many clubs, bars, restaurants, coffee houses and hotels. It feels like overkill. Every few months it seems as if the sets change. Please return to the days when there was one hangout spot for the show (example, Gina’s). 

The modern day writing on this show is disjointed and unorganized. The current writers do not know how to build suspense or drama nor do they know how to see it through. A good example of this is the Billy/Amanda storyline. One minute they are getting closer, kissing, and the next we no longer see them together. Amanda is now off dating/hooking up with Nate while Billy has started a job alongside Lily. Viewers never got to see any closure to Billy and Amanda’s storyline. In fact, we are left asking what the hell happened?

You guys have repeatedly dropped the ball with all the families on this show, but this is especially true for The Winters. I don’t understand why there is only one black family on this show. That ONE black family is stuck intermarrying, dating, and betraying each other. This needs to be addressed. I can give you a list of black characters that can be used to usher in a new black family. 

The cast needs to be overhauled along with their storylines. If you guys don’t intend to make the limited “Black” characters on this show fully developed characters with their own storylines you need to consider writing the Winters family off the show. Truth be told, it feels like the Winters died when Neil died. 

This is probably my biggest disappointment with the show. There has only been one black family featured on this show, and they have been used as “fillers” for the white characters and their storylines on the show. For example, Devon couldn’t even be front and center in his own storyline to reclaim his money. This task was allocated to Chance, who as far as viewers know has absolutely no connection to Devon. 

Furthermore, Devon has the personality of a doorknob. He is boring to watch. The character lacks development and direction. He was given Katherine’s money, but he doesn’t have any purpose in life. I don’t know a single black person who would be so bland upon inheriting billions of dollars from a wealthy grandparent. 

Devon has too big of a stick up his ass. He has been written in the same regard as Sidney Poitier’s character from Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner: A flawless black man, who is acceptable to white audiences, but otherwise boring as hell. It is not realistic considering Devon was once a homeless juvenile with an absentee (white) father, and a sorry excuse for a mother. The only “bad” things Devon has ever done is sleep with women who are off limits. Otherwise, he has been as stiff and boring as a piece of wood. A person with his background, who suddenly comes into billions of dollars, would not be so boring. 

Lily, who was raised by Drucilla, is the most non-black “black” woman I’ve ever seen. It is hard to believe the most dynamic black character this show has ever had (Drucilla) birthed and raised Lily under the same roof. Lily doesn’t come across as an authentic black woman for a number of reasons. 

One of the reasons your black viewers have never latched onto Lily, as we did Drucilla, is because the actress, who is supposedly portraying a black woman, is herself not black. It is rather insulting that you guys feel any old brown person can moonlight as a black woman and we, the viewers, won’t notice. If you wouldn’t hire a multiracial person to play the role of a white character with two white parents stop expecting this crap to fly with black people. 

I am aware that Kristoff St. John and Victoria Rowell were/are biracial. However, no one looking at them would ever see anything other than a black man and a black woman. The same with Shemar Moore. We cannot say the same for the actress who portrays Lily. Not only does she physically not look like any black woman I know, but she doesn’t carry herself with the essence, favor, and spirit of an African American woman. And no, I’m not talking about stereotypes. I’m talking about the spirit of endurance, strength, and soul that is effortlessly present in a group of women who have survived 400 years of oppression in a country we built. 

We know our own. We know she is not one of us. We do not relate to her nor do we see ourselves in her. Either consider a recast or write the character, Lily, off the show. I suggest you put the character in a coma and allow her to wake up with a new personality and a new face. 

The most likable black character you’ve had on this show in years was Hilary. She was a black woman who black women could relate. She could have filled the void left by Drucilla. She made Devon interesting as his love interest. Instead of using her to your advantage you killed her off only to have the actress return a year later as Amanda, Hilary’s long-lost twin. In yet another stale ridiculous storyline we, the viewers, were forced to watch the actress walk around in a tasteless wig for a storyline involving Devon losing his money to a con artist, who later returned it to him with an apology! Make it make sense!

If you do not plan to deal with the above issues regarding The Winters, or bring back Drucilla, consider creating and developing a new black family on this show. It is much needed. 

You have a very good potential storyline sitting on your lap with the character Jill. She now owns Katherine’s mansion and she owns Chancellor Industries. For all intents and purposes, she is now what Katherine was 40 years ago. Jill is now an older/mature woman, who is a grandmother. It’s time to give her a piece of what she gave Katherine. Give Jill a husband, who is seduced by a younger woman. Let her reconcile with the hurt and pain she caused Katherine when she began sleeping with Katherine’s husband, Phillip, and let the “other woman” have a child by her husband.

There needs to be a new matriarch on this show. It used to be Katherine. Now it should be Nikki. From the time Nikki has been introduced to the audience she has been needy and loss. She has been a stripper. She has been a chronic victim of alcoholism.  Her self-worth has always circled around Victor. She is The Young & The Restless’ version of Sue Ellen from Dallas. 

I would like to see Nikki emerge as an independent woman in her own right. Happy couples don’t last forever on soaps. Victor and Nikki need to divorce again, but this time I want to see Nikki walk away with a large chuck of the assets. I want to see a personality change in her that leads to her not being tied to a man or a bottle. 

On another note, consider recasting Victoria with the original actress who portrayed her, Heather Tom. For years now, the audience has dealt with this watered-down version of a character that was far spunkier and more emotional when she was portrayed by a different actress. Heather Tom’s version of Victoria reminded me of a female version of Victor. We believed she would fill Victor’s shoes at Newman Enterprises. Today’s version of Victoria is frail, needy, and annoying. 

The following characters are useless and need to be written off: Chole, Kevin, Summer, Kyle, Mariah, and Elena. 

The following characters need to be brought back to the show: Nina, Jill (full-time), Mackenzie, Drucilla, Ashley, Sheila, Malcolm, Cricket, Danny, and Mamie. 

The following characters need better storylines: Devon, Tessa, Victor, Victoria, Nikki, Jack, Michael, Lauren, Nicholas, and Sharon.

The following characters need to be recast: Lily, Adam, and Victoria. 

The following sets need to be brought back: The Chancellor mansion and the Athletic club. 

I hope these suggestions help. I’m willing to offer more if needed. Please feel free to reach out to me. Thank you for reading. 


Sincerely,

“Redacted”

1pdkyrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1pdkyrq/how_to_have_a_writing_contest_or_cry_trying/,How to have a writing contest or cry trying,"For my birthday this year I've decided to have a writing contest. I've got a decent bonus coming and figure more people are likely to do it with a cash prize. I pick three hundred dollars as a top prize. It seems like a good amount, enough that it might actually help someone as opposed to me just spending it on Lego and coffee.

Having never done this before, I assume it will be easy, so I start by securing a web address. This is surprisingly cheap to do. I come up with a site name that's easy to remember and boom! I'm the proud owner of a website.

I do a little more research and realize that I need someone to host my site. I find that everything is really expensive.

I'm doing this contest on my own dime; I have no intention of making it an ongoing thing or monetizing it, so I don't really want to spend a ton of money when I'd rather give it away as a prize. I put a pin on the domain thing and realize I need a way for people to contact me that sounds legitimate and not a total scam. So, I buy the email address through the same place I paid for the web site, now I have a way for people to contact me. Perfect. Very professional. This is going to be so fun and so easy. Who wouldn't want to do this?!

For the theme of the contest, I pick the origin of Bigfoot, fun quirky, very PNW. Man, this is going to be HUGE.

I research ways to put a website on the internet for free and I discover google.sites. I'm in business and unstoppable. I throw on some pictures, quick intro, literally no rules, and launch my site. I print some cryptic QR codes and start posting them EVERYWHERE. After a few days, I get zero hits. Hmmmm.

I let my family in on my contest, as an aside I don't know why I wanted to keep it a secret, maybe I didn't want it to be about me, more about the story. In my mind, during these trying times, people would find this fun common link, bond, and rally through the darkness. My SO gives me some pretty direct feedback. I update the site, create actual flyers, go to libraries and local business and ask them to post it. A friend messaged me that the site didn't work. Shit. I'm using google.sites to save money and you have to use [www](http://www/) for it to actually work. Is this why I'm not getting hits? Who knows! Regardless, the QR code works fine and so do the links. I start to think about how people look for things and I finally wonder if I google it, will it come up? I can't believe I didn't do this first.

I google my sites name and there's an immediate hit. I've stolen someone's Instagram handle. Shit. I message her, letting her know it was accidental and for the most part, temporary.

That same day I walked down to the Armory to check out the free art event, I've never been inside before, so I really wanted to check it out. Inside there are wall to wall booths, hundreds of people sharing their art. It's an amazing atmosphere, the perfect blend of commerce and art, it feels like Tacoma's soul. I buy some Zines from a young artist, she helps me do tap to pay and I tell her about the contest. I listen to a man talk about Tacoma's poetry scene and check out his books. I tell him about my contest and hand him a flyer. He recognizes the name from Instagram, and I have to explain what I've done. He mentions that she's here, at the venue and that she has a booth. The universe has guided me here! I find her booth introduce myself and explain the situation. She seems less than thrilled but understands. Later she messages me and we both update our sites. If you want to give her a follow, the link to my site is in the bio. You can figure it out from there.

A week goes by. Zero hits on the website. I become obsessed with understanding this. It's no longer about the contest. Now it's about understanding how this works.

I start posting on Threads and Bluesky daily, invading other people's posts, practically begging anyone to just LOOK at the site. I have an all-new respect for influencers and anyone attempting to make a living going viral. Its not easy. After a week of annoying posts I finally get a message from a writer. She let's me know im being throttled. I've been posting the link and the last thing these social media sites want you to do IS LEAVE THE SITE. She says my comments are being hidden. She gives me some amazing tips, and I thank her and ask her if she checked out the site to which she replies that she'll 'try to get around to it!' I'm beginning to think this won't work.

I finally get around to googling 'how to have a writing contest' and discover that there are sites that host contest all around the world. I submit my contest application to the top 3. I get a polite reply from a nationally recognized contest host that basically says good luck! Then I meet Chris. Chris is out of the UK, and his website is amazing. Hundreds of links to different writing contests worldwide. He offers to post my contest free of charge, but I gladly pay him knowing now how difficult this is. He gives me my own category and links my site for the world to see.

Two days later I get my first story. It's out of India. It's amazing, succinct and has perfect grammar and punctuation. It reads like butter. Another entry arrives as I'm reading the first one, then another. They are all from India. I read them all, compelling stories with perfect grammar and punctuation. The only problem is they are essentially the same story. They somehow feel soulless. Something about the punctuation bothers me, so I look it up. Its a tell–tale sign of chat gpt. Fuck.

So here we are, one month into this journey and even though it's not what I expected, it's been fun, fascinating and humbling. I tried posting this story on r/writers and got booted by the moderators. I'm not planning on giving up but I'm not sure it's going to work.

What would you do?

I and a group of friends are paranormal investigators. Like most paranormal investigators, we liked the occult and have always found it fascinating. As dumb and bored teenagers do, we decided to start seeking out the paranormal and maybe catch some proof while we‘re at it. So we figured we should all become „paranormal investigators “, which is a funny way of saying we break into abandoned houses and mess with our scared friends in „haunted“ woods. So far, we‘ve been through hospitals seeking out ghosts, hunting cryptids in forests, and using various rituals to summon demons. But most of the time, we get nothing, except one or two spooks because of animals like deer, or the most horrifying of them all, drugged-out homeless people. Most of the time, we record our little excursions and post them on either YouTube or Instagram. But after doing this for 5 years, we’ve only managed to produce around a couple thousand followers. On the internet, we go by “ The paranormal boys.” I do not know where we were going with that name, but at least it wasn’t “The supernatural exploration club!” like Bill suggested; even he was embarrassed afterwards and just accepted our first suggestion. At the time, we thought we were pretty funny, so we thought we’d become micro internet celebrities in no time, maybe even get signed to do a show or something. But now we just do it for fun. Me, Swansey, and Bill were always expecting to find some sort of proof at some point, but the only thing we got was a lot of useless, pricey equipment and Darek‘s smug smile. He is an avid denier of the supernatural, but always comes along to shit on our parade and just hang out. Lucy joined a lot later on, and she just tags along for Swansey. Swansey and I don‘t really believe in the supernatural; we just think it would be more fun/interesting if it were real. But now, we are all grown up, we‘re college students, and our outings have been reduced to maybe once every 2 months. And so, we thought we would finally say goodbye to this little hobby we have and visit 3 big places we all wanted to go. At first, we were planning to visit The Stanley Hotel, Eastern State Penitentiary, and the Waverly Hills Sanatorium. But when we posted about retiring to our dying Instagram, we got a few suggestions on where to go from our followers, most were some other famous places, but one stood out amongst the rest. Mostly because of the person who was suggesting it. It was an utterly bare profile that was created a year ago, and started following us, also a year ago. It had no profile picture, no description, no posts, no followers, and he also only followed our paranormal account and us personally. The one who was most disturbed by this fact was Lucy, since she never accepts random followers; she likes to keep her Instagram clean so as to avoid any creeps. The username was some gibberish, “pocytac5”. Ben got spooked from all of this and said he had a bad feeling about him. I, on the other hand, just grew curious, and the others seemed to reciprocate that feeling. They started very normally: “Hello, I encourage you to visit the Freetown-Fall River State Forest in Massachusetts.” A couple of minutes later, “ I have a map with a trail that would guarantee you a safe encounter with the real supernatural”, a map? A specific trail? It’s like this person was saying every keyword to interest us, we felt like dogs hearing our favourite words as we read the messages. We wrote back that we were interested in his offer and asked what we could encounter there and what made that specific trail so interesting. We expected them to write back fashionably late, but before we could even walk away from the computer, we were pleasantly surprised with an almost immediate write back. They uploaded a picture of a physical and ragged map, with a trail marked by a red marker, and only added “The forest dwellers”. The thing about the River State Forest is that we’ve been there before. It was our very first serious trip as paranormal hunters. Since it was the very first, we didn’t record it, and as far as we know, we’ve never mentioned the trip on our account. So with this in mind, the very cryptic messages and the blank account, stored for over a year with no activity, seemed incredibly intriguing. We were sold. We decided to add that place to our 3 destinations, after all, it felt right to have the very first place we visited be the one where we end it. After the decision was made, we wrote to the user “Thank you for your suggestion, and we’ve decided to trust you and your cryptic map. We’ll try to visit it in the next couple of weeks. See ya!” And as we predicted, we got no response, but we were all riled up, even Darek showed a little intrigue. After doing a little research on the place, we couldn’t find any trail that seemed to match the one on the map, but based on the distance, it was around a day’s trip to get to the end. We were fine with that distance because we thought we could head in the morning and camp there for a day. And after just a week, we were ready.  
**Part 2**  
We hopped in Lucy’s car and headed off to Massachusetts, back where it all began. During the trip, we all reminisced about the first time we went there. At the time, Lucy hadn’t joined us yet, so she just stayed quiet, visibly annoyed since she hated being left out. That’s why she joined us in the first place; she had FOMO. Back during our first visit, we didn’t find anything, except a few strange, faraway sounds, but we were still optimistic since the trail was on the opposite side from where we were previously. After we parked, we searched around for the trail for a good amount of time before we found a shabby old wooden plank, which had written in red letters “Hike 2, 12 miles.”, it seemed to fit the location and length of the trek so we preprared to head in, Swansey readied up the hand held camera and we checked our bags and items. Before heading in, Swansey got a notification. It was a message from pocytac5. It simply read “See ya.” After we all saw the message, we started looking around, and despite it being the middle of the day, we didn’t see anyone around us. Lucy stuck to Swansey like glue, creeped out by the message. Swansey tried to calm her down, reassuring her that it’s just a coincidence. Despite all of us agreeing, myself included, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was peering at us from deep within the forest. “At least he helped set up the vibe,” joked Bill. After a few hours of walking, we were back to talking and messing around. The forest was quite nice, relaxing; you could hear birds chirping all around, and the fresh air of the forest was poignant, and Lucy started whistling along with the birds. “Snow White”, Sweansey called her, and Bill ruined the moment by loudly gagging, “Leave the love BIRDS alone, Bill.” Darek said, proudly delivering the joke. I also gagged. Darek was the one leading us, with a printed-out map of the version sent to us. Following him was Bill, behind him were Sweansey and Lucy, walking together, and I was last. I was busy looking at the scenery, and because of that, I noticed a piece of paper on the ground. I picked it up and showed it to the others. “Maybe it’s Slenderman's!”, Darek chuckled “Maybe we can convince him to join the Lakers finally.” Sweansey took the piece of paper and started examining it while recording, “What is this? Looks like a bunch of messed-up letters.” “Can you read out any words?” Lucy asked curiously, also looking at the note. “Uhhhh, nah, not really, looks more like they’re trying to make up new words”. After a bit of thinking, we just figured it was some foreigner's trash. After losing interest in the paper, we continued to trudge along. As we were hiking, Darek was marking some of the trees with a red X. We wrote them to keep track of where we went, since the track we were on seemed more like a suggestion than an actual track. As we were about to approach the halfway point river, we noticed how we couldn’t hear birds anymore. However, we were still hearing a lot of cracking and creaking of branches, sometimes appearing as though the sound happened right behind us, although nothing was there. When we reached the river, we decided to set up camp. While setting up, Darek announced that he was going to go for a leak and then disappeared. After a few moments, Bill suddenly perked up and laughed. “Did you guys hear that? Moron.” “What are you talking about?” I asked him, “Darek; I think he slipped into the river, I heard a splash and a fuck.” After a minute or so, Darek came back, and I could see Bill readying up to mock him about his fall. Except Darek was fully dry, “Hey, was that not you that made that splashing noise?”, Darek raised his eyebrows and then shook his head, when I looked back to Bill, he seemed very confused, “I guess you heard wrong.” “ No, I definitely did hear it, but it came from the other way Darek came from.” I wanted to call bullshit, but Bill always had the best ears out of all of us we decided to just shrug it off. After finishing setting up our tents and cooking up some food, we decided to hit the sack. Sweansey and Lucy were sleeping together, Darek was sleeping with Bill, and I slept alone. I had trouble sleeping. I was rolling around for what must’ve been an hour, and after I was finally so close to falling asleep, I started hearing weird noises around me, footsteps, faint breathing. I figured someone must’ve woken up and gone to take a leak or something. Making excuses to calm myself down and finally sleep, I couldn’t help but hear that they were nearing my tent, slowly, quietly, almost like prowling. By that point, it was extremely dark, but I could still see a faint shadow creeping up, illuminated by the moon. I couldn’t tell if it was just the shadow, but they seemed long, stretched out, longer than any torso should be. At that point, I was frozen in fear, trying to breathe slowly and rhythmically, pretending to be asleep. I felt an adrenaline rush that I felt as a child pretending to be asleep, so I wouldn’t get in trouble for staying up late. It seemed like hours had passed while that figure was just standing there, watching, while in reality it was probably just a minute or two, and after an excruciating wait, the figure slinked away into the forest, never turning around, always keeping an eye on me. I wanted to piss my pants, but I was too afraid to even do that. I didn’t fall asleep for at least 3 hours after that. I was scared that they would come back, but this time. Not just to stare. I woke up in the morning to the sound of Darek talking to Bill and getting out of his tent. I immediately got up as well. He looked at me and raised his eyebrow. “Rough night?“ “Yeah, I couldn’t sleep. Did you by chance wake up in the night?” “Uhh, no, I was fast asleep?” “Fuck. I was scared shitless the entire night. I think someone came from the woods and just fucking stood there staring into my tent in the middle of the night. “Are you sure? Maybe you dreamt it?” “Yes, I’m fucking sure, don’t be a dick, and I couldn’t have dreamt it either, it felt too real.” Seeing how serious I was, Darek decided to take me seriously too “Okay, calm down, let’s wait for the rest of them to wake up and we’ll discuss it with them later, as of now I’ll check around the perimeter if it makes you feel better.”. I sat with Bill till Darek came back with a worried expression and woke the rest up. After we freshened up and I calmed down, I told everyone what I had experienced. At first, everyone was apprehensive, and Bill thought I was making it up to scare him, I can’t blame him; it wouldn’t be the first time we did that. But after everyone finished processing the story, Darek interjected with a sour face, “I went to check around for any signs of other people being here, and I… found this…”, he showed us a note, with red Sharpie written on it “Turn back, as fast as you can, don’t stop” it’s written sloppily as though they were in a hurry. After seeing the paper, I could feel my eyes watering, because the others believed me a little bit more, but more so, I wanted to cry. After all, this confirmed it was real. I would’ve much rather been in a lucid dream, or that someone was fucking with me. “Oh, so the guy who HAS a red sharpie, found a creepy cryptic note, which was written with a red sharpie? Uhhh, yeah, sure.” Bill pointed out accusingly. Darek frowned with the rest of us. “I might be a little mean, but I wouldn’t make this shit up. I might not believe in the supernatural and shit, but this is clearly the work of a deranged person, which is much scarier than your fairy tales.” I couldn’t be mad at Bill; I also wanted this to be just some prank by Darek. We all started packing our things and started heading back. Even if the note was ominous, it had the right message; we were getting the fuck out of here. I asked Darek for the note to examine it a little bit more and shoved it into my pocket. After getting ready, we started heading back. While walking back, we followed the trees that we had marked. I was lost in thought when we all stopped, and I bumped into Bill. “Guys, what’s the hold up?” I asked, rubbing my nose, still being the one farthest behind.” The X’s, they diverge.” I didn’t understand what they meant, so I pushed past them to the front. In front of us were rows of trees with our signature mark, but they diverged; two different paths had red X’s following along them. “How the hell…” I muttered under my breath. Sweansey went in closer with his camera to inspect the X’s. “They both look identical, I can’t tell which one was the one I made.” As Sweansey inspected the X, Lucy shakily pointed towards the ground and quietly said, “There’s another one…” When I looked towards the ground, I saw another note. I steeled my resolve and picked it up. This time, in the same crude handwriting, it said, “Do not traverse on the same ground as you did before, or else you will meet them. The note is placed on the path you have not traversed yet”. “Who the fuck is “Them”?” I exclaimed, Darek took the note from my hands and read it outloud, “damn it, we still don’t know which way we came from”, “but the note said-“ Lucy stammered before being interrupted by Darek “I know what they said, but do you trust this person? If he wants to lead us to him, then he would obviously try to deter us from the path we need to go!”, “He could also be using reverse psychology on us,” Bill muttered, biting his finger. We all started to discuss all of the possibilities and the risks of taking such paths. It felt like trying to complete a puzzle with missing pieces. Sawnsey interjected, “I say we stop overthinking it and just vote on which path to go. We can’t just stay here all day, either way, we don’t know what kind of mind games they’re playing, it’s basically just a 50/50.” I could hear Darek take a big gulp. “All right, who wants to take the path without the note? Raise your hands.” He raised his hand

“Bill shook his head. “No, they’ve gotta be smarter than that. I vote the opposite.” “I think so too..” Lucy answered. “I’m sorry, honey, I gotta trust my gut on this one,” and Sweansey raised his hand. Lucy shot an angry look at him, then, after realising the vote is still a tie and there is still one vote left, she turned to me, with glistening eyes that were practically begging me to choose her side. Everyone was silent, but I could tell they were all begging me to choose their side. In the end, if the person who kept me up at night went the new way, I want to keep myself as far away from him as possible, so I chose the path without the note. Darek gave me a nod of approval, and Swansey sighed a breath of relief, while Lucy, with Bill, looked at me with a dejected look. We marched on. The whole way, we were practically speed walking, not fast enough for a run, but definitely in a hurry. While speed walking our way, Bill stopped right in front of me, causing me to bump into him. “SHhhhhh, shut the fuck up for a second.” We all stood still, stiffer than the trees around us, and we listened. Wind? No. It’s something more than that… A whistle? A rhythmic whistle. “Are those… Normal people?” I whispered. “No one goes on this track. Remember how abandoned it was? There’s bearly a path, it’s them, it’s definitely them. Let’s head back” whispered Darek. Everyone except Swansey and Bill immediately nodded their head and started quietly turning back. I went back and grabbed his arm, ushering him to wake up and run. He looked pale and confused, but he listened to me and started following me. We tried running on the path we came from, quickly scanning around for the X’s, but somehow at some point, we managed to lose them. It seemed like they just disappeared. And now, we’re lost. We strayed too far off the path. After calming down and confirming that we could no longer hear them, we slowed down to rest and recuperate. Bill was panicking, fiddeling with the map, trying to figure out where we were. Then Swansey asked a question, “Did you guys not recognise the whistling?”  Darek shot him a questioning glance. “It… It sounded like Lucy… Even the rhythim…” “What? You’re saying they recorded me?” “No, it didn’t sound like a recording…” Bill started rubbing his eyes. “Fuck… I hoped I just misheard… But yeah, I can confirm,” I looked at Lucy, who just seemed to be bewildered. Everything was weird, too weird to even start thinking about it. “I guess we chose wrong?” I let out the thought that seemed to be the simplest. “I guess ya’ll did,” Bill shot back. Darek clenched his fist, readying to hit Bill, but Lucy interjected, “Enough with the smarky remarks, we need to think about what to do next, we can’t fight each other in a time like this.” Bill rolled his eyes and looked away, while Darek snarled his nostrils and sat down. After a civil discussion, we decided to head west, as that was the direction the other path led. This time, we sauntered, listening to everything around us, and we kept snapping towards any noise we heard, whether it was a tree slowly creaking, a nut falling, or a bird whistling; every stick we stepped on and snapped felt like a siren alerting our position. I almost felt primal in the way we were slinking around, like prey being hunted. And even when we walked for hours without anything else happening, stress only seemed to rise as the sun descended and the night came to be. While walking, Darek came to me and started to ask me questions about the night, about the person. His physique, any weapons, were there multiple? The more vague answers I gave him, the more annoyed he seemed to become. “If it was one bastard, we could’ve taken him out; we didn’t need to even start running.” I only nodded. “I’m sorry, we all got lost because of me.” He apologized through gritted teeth. “We were all scared and confused; you were the only one who reacted fast enough.” “But maybe if I hadn’t have-“ “Maybe if we had stayed there, we would’ve been shot. In a perfect world, they would have just taken Bill as a sacrifice and let the rest of us go.” Darek cracked a smile. “Thanks.” I smiled and responded, “Aye, aye, captain.” As the evening descended upon us, we finally found a clue as to where we could be. We were back at the river. Darek pulled out his map, stating that we have to memorise everything we can to make use of the fleeting light. We didn’t want to sleep. As we were walking along the river, Lucy called attention to something moving in the bushes to our left, and as we all looked over to investigate, we could hear a big splash to our right. It was Darek. While looking the other way, he tripped on a rock and tumbled into the river. It wasn’t a big fall, so he didn’t get injured, but all of his clothes, and most importantly, the map, was torn and wet, and now unusable. Once he realised that, he screamed “FUCK!” out of anger and desperation. We wanted to travel during the night, but plans changed. It wasn’t a chilly day, but the night definitely will be, and with Darek being all wet, it certainly wasn’t going to pan out great for him. He tried to object, but we all needed a break after a full day of hiking and running around. We agreed to leave 2 people on night watch and figured that would be our safest option. While discussing, I noticed that Bill was unusually quiet, but chalked it up to him just being extremely scared; at least he wasn’t frantic. We decided that the first 2 people watching guard will be Darek and Sweansey, then Bill and me. Once we made our tents, I immediately fell asleep; the exhaustion and lack of sleep really hit me hard. After around 4 hours of sleep, Bill woke me up; it was our turn to keep watch. I got up, groggy as all hell, and brewed up a coffee on the campfire. I knew I was going to need a lot of energy today. While sitting, Bill spoke up first. “What do you think of today?” “What do you mean?” “I mean, do you think it’s someone who is stalking us?” I furrowed my eyebrows. “I mean, yeah, I saw them. Are you still doubting me?”  Bill shook his head. “No, I just… I’ve been thinking, and I’ve cooked up a theory that even I think is kind of crazy…”  I raised my eyebrow and prepared for some “IT’S THE DEVIL” talk. “I’ve got 2 theories. 1. We’re dealing with some sort of a copycat, we heard Lucies whistling, they copied our X’s, and they seem to be observing us, or at least that’s what it seemed like when that thing was watching you sleep.” “And the second one?” “We’re in some sort of time loop.” I sighed, “Okay, I think you need some more sleep.” “No, just think about it! The whistling happened around the same time of day, when Lucy was whistling the day before. But the thing that raised the biggest red flag was Darek… Remember when we were setting up camp in the evening? I told you I heard him scream… And now, it sounded exactly alike. I can’t get it out of my head…” “That’s crazy, even by your standards” I gripped the bridge of my nose, trying to process what he just said. But then I noticed something. It was really quiet, much more than usual; there were no grasshoppers or mosquitoes, no rustling trees, just a slight breeze. The eerie quiet, I don’t like it; it feels like everything around us is hiding from something. Bill, realising the silence that seemed to surround us, started looking around with me. The moon was very bright. After a few minutes of looking into the darkness, my eyes acclimated. And for some reason, my eyes seemed to gravitate towards some strange forms, rocks perhaps? A little deeper into the forest. I don’t know what it was, it seemed like I recognised those forms. And even if it sounds like a crazy idea, I wanted to check it out. It didn’t seem dangerous, and maybe if I recognised the place, we could find our way back. I looked at Bill and told him I’d be right back. He looked at me and made a facial expression that screamed don’t do it. I picked up a flashlight and a camping knife and slowly started walking over there. “If I hear your scream, I’m waking up the others, and we’re all leaving you behind, you got that?” Bill whispered angrily, “If you’re so worried for me, then come with.” Bill sighed and just shook his head,” God damn white people…” I knew he would be too scared to follow, so I continued my path. The closer I got, the farther the shapes appeared. I realised that they were sort of far away, but I didn’t want to stop. I was too curious about what it was. I thought if something or someone wanted to snatch me, it would have happened already. I was close enough to finally see what it is.",1,1764806403.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1pdkspi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1pdkspi/needing_a_bit_of_help_staying_on_task/,Needing a bit of help - Staying on Task,"Hey everyone. I'm hoping to get some suggestions from you guys. My process basically works like this:

1. Wake up in the morning, fire up the software, go make a cup of coffee, if I have time shower. I start at 3AM.

2. I have some custom scanners, I try to put a bit of time into my software.

3. I try to gather data for trades in a notebook and/or spreadsheet. These are temporary while I get it all organized in my scripts so I can start automating it.

I have several strategies I use. I do some momentum but I tend to shy away from it. I look mainly at microcaps / scam stocks. My process involves checking dilution, short data, relatively granular historical short data, checking price action, getting various S/R levels, checking historical filings, etc. If the stock looks good on the first pass, I might spend 5-15 minutes going through and double-checking stuff. I get pretty technical. I have several texts on corporate finance, securities and statistics and do spend time studying them.

Examples of stocks I've found and verified using this:

CMCT (found at 4.5, hit like 14 I think)

PLRZ (found sub 5, probably hitting $20 now - I got pissed and closed it all out today)

KALA 

ZYXI

I also set price targets, but I think I could probably set my entries better. Keeping track, my hit rate is \~48% on these with a target R of 1.5:1 to 5:1 - it really depends on a lot of factors. If it is less than a clean 1.5 I either don't take the trade or reduce position size. Thinking about this, I should also record how many trades I don't enter that end up being good trades. 

So I'm looking for help/suggestions/insight with three things:

1. I am diagnosed ADHD and take medication for it, but I hyper focus and sometimes that's a bad thing. I kinda suck at momentum so I don't really try to do those scalps anymore.

2. I have taken very heavy losses. Not so much the last few months, but I've significantly reduced position sizes. I keep closing early. Sometimes I hit my stop or just past it and go ahead and exit. I miss a lot of wins from not letting the trade work out, but I do avoid some losses. I need to get hard data on this.

3. I keep either waiting for a perfect entry as I have had limited capital / trades, or I get scared and don't enter. It sucks seeing 4 of the 5 or 6 stocks I had picked for the day run at least 30% and I didn't enter because reasons.

Obviously, there is the whole ""once you lose enough money you will quit doing that"" - but man, it's just not working. I just can't seem to strike a balance. Thanks guys.",1,1764806333.0,Trading,2,1.0,False

Wake up → work → scrolling → chores → sleep… repeat.
No pause, no check-in, no reflection. Total autopilot.

Today I finally sat down for 5 minutes and asked myself one simple question:

“What actually made me feel good this week?”

Not “productive,” not “successful,” not “perfect”… just good.

And honestly?
The answer surprised me.

It wasn’t the long to-do list I forced myself through.
It wasn’t grinding through burnout or pushing myself to “stay consistent.”

It was the tiny, underrated moments:

The 10-minute walk where I actually breathed

Drinking water before my coffee (big win for me 😂)

Saying “no” to something I didn’t have the energy for

Checking in with a friend I’d been avoiding because life was “too much”

Sleeping early one night and waking up feeling human again


It made me realize something I think a lot of us forget:

Wellbeing isn’t built through massive life changes — it’s built through small habits you repeat without punishing yourself.

If you’ve been feeling:

stuck

overwhelmed

mentally exhausted

or like you’re failing at “self-care”…


You’re not alone. Most adults are quietly fighting the same battles: burnout, anxiety, inconsistency, pressure to improve, comparing ourselves to others, all of it.

So here’s a tiny challenge for the community:

What’s ONE small, realistic habit that made you feel better this week?

Something tiny. Something soft. Something human.
Drop it below — your answer might help someone else who’s struggling.

Let’s use this thread as a quiet reset button for the whole community.
We’re all figuring it out together.

I and a group of friends are paranormal investigators. Like most paranormal investigators, we liked the occult and have always found it fascinating. As dumb and bored teenagers do, we decided to start seeking out the paranormal and maybe catch some proof while we‘re at it. So we figured we should all become „paranormal investigators “, which is a funny way of saying we break into abandoned houses and mess with our scared friends in „haunted“ woods. So far, we‘ve been through hospitals seeking out ghosts, hunting cryptids in forests, and using various rituals to summon demons. But most of the time, we get nothing, except one or two spooks because of animals like deer, or the most horrifying of them all, drugged-out homeless people. Most of the time, we record our little excursions and post them on either YouTube or Instagram. But after doing this for 5 years, we’ve only managed to produce around a couple thousand followers. On the internet, we go by “ The paranormal boys.” I do not know where we were going with that name, but at least it wasn’t “The supernatural exploration club!” like Bill suggested; even he was embarrassed afterwards and just accepted our first suggestion. At the time, we thought we were pretty funny, so we thought we’d become micro internet celebrities in no time, maybe even get signed to do a show or something. But now we just do it for fun. Me, Swansey, and Bill were always expecting to find some sort of proof at some point, but the only thing we got was a lot of useless, pricey equipment and Darek‘s smug smile. He is an avid denier of the supernatural, but always comes along to shit on our parade and just hang out. Lucy joined a lot later on, and she just tags along for Swansey. Swansey and I don‘t really believe in the supernatural; we just think it would be more fun/interesting if it were real. But now, we are all grown up, we‘re college students, and our outings have been reduced to maybe once every 2 months. And so, we thought we would finally say goodbye to this little hobby we have and visit 3 big places we all wanted to go. At first, we were planning to visit The Stanley Hotel, Eastern State Penitentiary, and the Waverly Hills Sanatorium. But when we posted about retiring to our dying Instagram, we got a few suggestions on where to go from our followers, most were some other famous places, but one stood out amongst the rest. Mostly because of the person who was suggesting it. It was an utterly bare profile that was created a year ago, and started following us, also a year ago. It had no profile picture, no description, no posts, no followers, and he also only followed our paranormal account and us personally. The one who was most disturbed by this fact was Lucy, since she never accepts random followers; she likes to keep her Instagram clean so as to avoid any creeps. The username was some gibberish, “pocytac5”. Ben got spooked from all of this and said he had a bad feeling about him. I, on the other hand, just grew curious, and the others seemed to reciprocate that feeling. They started very normally: “Hello, I encourage you to visit the Freetown-Fall River State Forest in Massachusetts.” A couple of minutes later, “ I have a map with a trail that would guarantee you a safe encounter with the real supernatural”, a map? A specific trail? It’s like this person was saying every keyword to interest us, we felt like dogs hearing our favourite words as we read the messages. We wrote back that we were interested in his offer and asked what we could encounter there and what made that specific trail so interesting. We expected them to write back fashionably late, but before we could even walk away from the computer, we were pleasantly surprised with an almost immediate write back. They uploaded a picture of a physical and ragged map, with a trail marked by a red marker, and only added “The forest dwellers”. The thing about the River State Forest is that we’ve been there before. It was our very first serious trip as paranormal hunters. Since it was the very first, we didn’t record it, and as far as we know, we’ve never mentioned the trip on our account. So with this in mind, the very cryptic messages and the blank account, stored for over a year with no activity, seemed incredibly intriguing. We were sold. We decided to add that place to our 3 destinations, after all, it felt right to have the very first place we visited be the one where we end it. After the decision was made, we wrote to the user “Thank you for your suggestion, and we’ve decided to trust you and your cryptic map. We’ll try to visit it in the next couple of weeks. See ya!” And as we predicted, we got no response, but we were all riled up, even Darek showed a little intrigue. After doing a little research on the place, we couldn’t find any trail that seemed to match the one on the map, but based on the distance, it was around a day’s trip to get to the end. We were fine with that distance because we thought we could head in the morning and camp there for a day. And after just a week, we were ready.  
**Part 2**  
We hopped in Lucy’s car and headed off to Massachusetts, back where it all began. During the trip, we all reminisced about the first time we went there. At the time, Lucy hadn’t joined us yet, so she just stayed quiet, visibly annoyed since she hated being left out. That’s why she joined us in the first place; she had FOMO. Back during our first visit, we didn’t find anything, except a few strange, faraway sounds, but we were still optimistic since the trail was on the opposite side from where we were previously. After we parked, we searched around for the trail for a good amount of time before we found a shabby old wooden plank, which had written in red letters “Hike 2, 12 miles.”, it seemed to fit the location and length of the trek so we preprared to head in, Swansey readied up the hand held camera and we checked our bags and items. Before heading in, Swansey got a notification. It was a message from pocytac5. It simply read “See ya.” After we all saw the message, we started looking around, and despite it being the middle of the day, we didn’t see anyone around us. Lucy stuck to Swansey like glue, creeped out by the message. Swansey tried to calm her down, reassuring her that it’s just a coincidence. Despite all of us agreeing, myself included, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was peering at us from deep within the forest. “At least he helped set up the vibe,” joked Bill. After a few hours of walking, we were back to talking and messing around. The forest was quite nice, relaxing; you could hear birds chirping all around, and the fresh air of the forest was poignant, and Lucy started whistling along with the birds. “Snow White”, Sweansey called her, and Bill ruined the moment by loudly gagging, “Leave the love BIRDS alone, Bill.” Darek said, proudly delivering the joke. I also gagged. Darek was the one leading us, with a printed-out map of the version sent to us. Following him was Bill, behind him were Sweansey and Lucy, walking together, and I was last. I was busy looking at the scenery, and because of that, I noticed a piece of paper on the ground. I picked it up and showed it to the others. “Maybe it’s Slenderman's!”, Darek chuckled “Maybe we can convince him to join the Lakers finally.” Sweansey took the piece of paper and started examining it while recording, “What is this? Looks like a bunch of messed-up letters.” “Can you read out any words?” Lucy asked curiously, also looking at the note. “Uhhhh, nah, not really, looks more like they’re trying to make up new words”. After a bit of thinking, we just figured it was some foreigner's trash. After losing interest in the paper, we continued to trudge along. As we were hiking, Darek was marking some of the trees with a red X. We wrote them to keep track of where we went, since the track we were on seemed more like a suggestion than an actual track. As we were about to approach the halfway point river, we noticed how we couldn’t hear birds anymore. However, we were still hearing a lot of cracking and creaking of branches, sometimes appearing as though the sound happened right behind us, although nothing was there. When we reached the river, we decided to set up camp. While setting up, Darek announced that he was going to go for a leak and then disappeared. After a few moments, Bill suddenly perked up and laughed. “Did you guys hear that? Moron.” “What are you talking about?” I asked him, “Darek; I think he slipped into the river, I heard a splash and a fuck.” After a minute or so, Darek came back, and I could see Bill readying up to mock him about his fall. Except Darek was fully dry, “Hey, was that not you that made that splashing noise?”, Darek raised his eyebrows and then shook his head, when I looked back to Bill, he seemed very confused, “I guess you heard wrong.” “ No, I definitely did hear it, but it came from the other way Darek came from.” I wanted to call bullshit, but Bill always had the best ears out of all of us we decided to just shrug it off. After finishing setting up our tents and cooking up some food, we decided to hit the sack. Sweansey and Lucy were sleeping together, Darek was sleeping with Bill, and I slept alone. I had trouble sleeping. I was rolling around for what must’ve been an hour, and after I was finally so close to falling asleep, I started hearing weird noises around me, footsteps, faint breathing. I figured someone must’ve woken up and gone to take a leak or something. Making excuses to calm myself down and finally sleep, I couldn’t help but hear that they were nearing my tent, slowly, quietly, almost like prowling. By that point, it was extremely dark, but I could still see a faint shadow creeping up, illuminated by the moon. I couldn’t tell if it was just the shadow, but they seemed long, stretched out, longer than any torso should be. At that point, I was frozen in fear, trying to breathe slowly and rhythmically, pretending to be asleep. I felt an adrenaline rush that I felt as a child pretending to be asleep, so I wouldn’t get in trouble for staying up late. It seemed like hours had passed while that figure was just standing there, watching, while in reality it was probably just a minute or two, and after an excruciating wait, the figure slinked away into the forest, never turning around, always keeping an eye on me. I wanted to piss my pants, but I was too afraid to even do that. I didn’t fall asleep for at least 3 hours after that. I was scared that they would come back, but this time. Not just to stare. I woke up in the morning to the sound of Darek talking to Bill and getting out of his tent. I immediately got up as well. He looked at me and raised his eyebrow. “Rough night?“ “Yeah, I couldn’t sleep. Did you by chance wake up in the night?” “Uhh, no, I was fast asleep?” “Fuck. I was scared shitless the entire night. I think someone came from the woods and just fucking stood there staring into my tent in the middle of the night. “Are you sure? Maybe you dreamt it?” “Yes, I’m fucking sure, don’t be a dick, and I couldn’t have dreamt it either, it felt too real.” Seeing how serious I was, Darek decided to take me seriously too “Okay, calm down, let’s wait for the rest of them to wake up and we’ll discuss it with them later, as of now I’ll check around the perimeter if it makes you feel better.”. I sat with Bill till Darek came back with a worried expression and woke the rest up. After we freshened up and I calmed down, I told everyone what I had experienced. At first, everyone was apprehensive, and Bill thought I was making it up to scare him, I can’t blame him; it wouldn’t be the first time we did that. But after everyone finished processing the story, Darek interjected with a sour face, “I went to check around for any signs of other people being here, and I… found this…”, he showed us a note, with red Sharpie written on it “Turn back, as fast as you can, don’t stop” it’s written sloppily as though they were in a hurry. After seeing the paper, I could feel my eyes watering, because the others believed me a little bit more, but more so, I wanted to cry. After all, this confirmed it was real. I would’ve much rather been in a lucid dream, or that someone was fucking with me. “Oh, so the guy who HAS a red sharpie, found a creepy cryptic note, which was written with a red sharpie? Uhhh, yeah, sure.” Bill pointed out accusingly. Darek frowned with the rest of us. “I might be a little mean, but I wouldn’t make this shit up. I might not believe in the supernatural and shit, but this is clearly the work of a deranged person, which is much scarier than your fairy tales.” I couldn’t be mad at Bill; I also wanted this to be just some prank by Darek. We all started packing our things and started heading back. Even if the note was ominous, it had the right message; we were getting the fuck out of here. I asked Darek for the note to examine it a little bit more and shoved it into my pocket. After getting ready, we started heading back. While walking back, we followed the trees that we had marked. I was lost in thought when we all stopped, and I bumped into Bill. “Guys, what’s the hold up?” I asked, rubbing my nose, still being the one farthest behind.” The X’s, they diverge.” I didn’t understand what they meant, so I pushed past them to the front. In front of us were rows of trees with our signature mark, but they diverged; two different paths had red X’s following along them. “How the hell…” I muttered under my breath. Sweansey went in closer with his camera to inspect the X’s. “They both look identical, I can’t tell which one was the one I made.” As Sweansey inspected the X, Lucy shakily pointed towards the ground and quietly said, “There’s another one…” When I looked towards the ground, I saw another note. I steeled my resolve and picked it up. This time, in the same crude handwriting, it said, “Do not traverse on the same ground as you did before, or else you will meet them. The note is placed on the path you have not traversed yet”. “Who the fuck is “Them”?” I exclaimed, Darek took the note from my hands and read it outloud, “damn it, we still don’t know which way we came from”, “but the note said-“ Lucy stammered before being interrupted by Darek “I know what they said, but do you trust this person? If he wants to lead us to him, then he would obviously try to deter us from the path we need to go!”, “He could also be using reverse psychology on us,” Bill muttered, biting his finger. We all started to discuss all of the possibilities and the risks of taking such paths. It felt like trying to complete a puzzle with missing pieces. Sawnsey interjected, “I say we stop overthinking it and just vote on which path to go. We can’t just stay here all day, either way, we don’t know what kind of mind games they’re playing, it’s basically just a 50/50.” I could hear Darek take a big gulp. “All right, who wants to take the path without the note? Raise your hands.” He raised his hand

“Bill shook his head. “No, they’ve gotta be smarter than that. I vote the opposite.” “I think so too..” Lucy answered. “I’m sorry, honey, I gotta trust my gut on this one,” and Sweansey raised his hand. Lucy shot an angry look at him, then, after realising the vote is still a tie and there is still one vote left, she turned to me, with glistening eyes that were practically begging me to choose her side. Everyone was silent, but I could tell they were all begging me to choose their side. In the end, if the person who kept me up at night went the new way, I want to keep myself as far away from him as possible, so I chose the path without the note. Darek gave me a nod of approval, and Swansey sighed a breath of relief, while Lucy, with Bill, looked at me with a dejected look. We marched on. The whole way, we were practically speed walking, not fast enough for a run, but definitely in a hurry. While speed walking our way, Bill stopped right in front of me, causing me to bump into him. “SHhhhhh, shut the fuck up for a second.” We all stood still, stiffer than the trees around us, and we listened. Wind? No. It’s something more than that… A whistle? A rhythmic whistle. “Are those… Normal people?” I whispered. “No one goes on this track. Remember how abandoned it was? There’s bearly a path, it’s them, it’s definitely them. Let’s head back” whispered Darek. Everyone except Swansey and Bill immediately nodded their head and started quietly turning back. I went back and grabbed his arm, ushering him to wake up and run. He looked pale and confused, but he listened to me and started following me. We tried running on the path we came from, quickly scanning around for the X’s, but somehow at some point, we managed to lose them. It seemed like they just disappeared. And now, we’re lost. We strayed too far off the path. After calming down and confirming that we could no longer hear them, we slowed down to rest and recuperate. Bill was panicking, fiddeling with the map, trying to figure out where we were. Then Swansey asked a question, “Did you guys not recognise the whistling?”  Darek shot him a questioning glance. “It… It sounded like Lucy… Even the rhythim…” “What? You’re saying they recorded me?” “No, it didn’t sound like a recording…” Bill started rubbing his eyes. “Fuck… I hoped I just misheard… But yeah, I can confirm,” I looked at Lucy, who just seemed to be bewildered. Everything was weird, too weird to even start thinking about it. “I guess we chose wrong?” I let out the thought that seemed to be the simplest. “I guess ya’ll did,” Bill shot back. Darek clenched his fist, readying to hit Bill, but Lucy interjected, “Enough with the smarky remarks, we need to think about what to do next, we can’t fight each other in a time like this.” Bill rolled his eyes and looked away, while Darek snarled his nostrils and sat down. After a civil discussion, we decided to head west, as that was the direction the other path led. This time, we sauntered, listening to everything around us, and we kept snapping towards any noise we heard, whether it was a tree slowly creaking, a nut falling, or a bird whistling; every stick we stepped on and snapped felt like a siren alerting our position. I almost felt primal in the way we were slinking around, like prey being hunted. And even when we walked for hours without anything else happening, stress only seemed to rise as the sun descended and the night came to be. While walking, Darek came to me and started to ask me questions about the night, about the person. His physique, any weapons, were there multiple? The more vague answers I gave him, the more annoyed he seemed to become. “If it was one bastard, we could’ve taken him out; we didn’t need to even start running.” I only nodded. “I’m sorry, we all got lost because of me.” He apologized through gritted teeth. “We were all scared and confused; you were the only one who reacted fast enough.” “But maybe if I hadn’t have-“ “Maybe if we had stayed there, we would’ve been shot. In a perfect world, they would have just taken Bill as a sacrifice and let the rest of us go.” Darek cracked a smile. “Thanks.” I smiled and responded, “Aye, aye, captain.” As the evening descended upon us, we finally found a clue as to where we could be. We were back at the river. Darek pulled out his map, stating that we have to memorise everything we can to make use of the fleeting light. We didn’t want to sleep. As we were walking along the river, Lucy called attention to something moving in the bushes to our left, and as we all looked over to investigate, we could hear a big splash to our right. It was Darek. While looking the other way, he tripped on a rock and tumbled into the river. It wasn’t a big fall, so he didn’t get injured, but all of his clothes, and most importantly, the map, was torn and wet, and now unusable. Once he realised that, he screamed “FUCK!” out of anger and desperation. We wanted to travel during the night, but plans changed. It wasn’t a chilly day, but the night definitely will be, and with Darek being all wet, it certainly wasn’t going to pan out great for him. He tried to object, but we all needed a break after a full day of hiking and running around. We agreed to leave 2 people on night watch and figured that would be our safest option. While discussing, I noticed that Bill was unusually quiet, but chalked it up to him just being extremely scared; at least he wasn’t frantic. We decided that the first 2 people watching guard will be Darek and Sweansey, then Bill and me. Once we made our tents, I immediately fell asleep; the exhaustion and lack of sleep really hit me hard. After around 4 hours of sleep, Bill woke me up; it was our turn to keep watch. I got up, groggy as all hell, and brewed up a coffee on the campfire. I knew I was going to need a lot of energy today. While sitting, Bill spoke up first. “What do you think of today?” “What do you mean?” “I mean, do you think it’s someone who is stalking us?” I furrowed my eyebrows. “I mean, yeah, I saw them. Are you still doubting me?”  Bill shook his head. “No, I just… I’ve been thinking, and I’ve cooked up a theory that even I think is kind of crazy…”  I raised my eyebrow and prepared for some “IT’S THE DEVIL” talk. “I’ve got 2 theories. 1. We’re dealing with some sort of a copycat, we heard Lucies whistling, they copied our X’s, and they seem to be observing us, or at least that’s what it seemed like when that thing was watching you sleep.” “And the second one?” “We’re in some sort of time loop.” I sighed, “Okay, I think you need some more sleep.” “No, just think about it! The whistling happened around the same time of day, when Lucy was whistling the day before. But the thing that raised the biggest red flag was Darek… Remember when we were setting up camp in the evening? I told you I heard him scream… And now, it sounded exactly alike. I can’t get it out of my head…” “That’s crazy, even by your standards” I gripped the bridge of my nose, trying to process what he just said. But then I noticed something. It was really quiet, much more than usual; there were no grasshoppers or mosquitoes, no rustling trees, just a slight breeze. The eerie quiet, I don’t like it; it feels like everything around us is hiding from something. Bill, realising the silence that seemed to surround us, started looking around with me. The moon was very bright. After a few minutes of looking into the darkness, my eyes acclimated. And for some reason, my eyes seemed to gravitate towards some strange forms, rocks perhaps? A little deeper into the forest. I don’t know what it was, it seemed like I recognised those forms. And even if it sounds like a crazy idea, I wanted to check it out. It didn’t seem dangerous, and maybe if I recognised the place, we could find our way back. I looked at Bill and told him I’d be right back. He looked at me and made a facial expression that screamed don’t do it. I picked up a flashlight and a camping knife and slowly started walking over there. “If I hear your scream, I’m waking up the others, and we’re all leaving you behind, you got that?” Bill whispered angrily, “If you’re so worried for me, then come with.” Bill sighed and just shook his head,” God damn white people…” I knew he would be too scared to follow, so I continued my path. The closer I got, the farther the shapes appeared. I realised that they were sort of far away, but I didn’t want to stop. I was too curious about what it was. I thought if something or someone wanted to snatch me, it would have happened already. I was close enough to finally see what it is.",1,1764806225.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I feel like crying. Why am i sad? Jcp.
This is ironic.. Few hours ago i was sitting with my dad going through the documents and i got a weird blurst of laughter. Fou-rire.
Laughs slipped out of me while holding to dear life fo not explode laughing out loud 😂 (least sane moment of the day). & now im like i wanna cry..

Wellahi being a woman sometimes is crazy! I'm glad this rarey ever happens to me.

Does this happen to all humans? ""say yes says yes cuz i need to know""

Imagine feeling a certain way because ur hormones said so. N the conscious bit in you is watching the hormonal you. So now you have to take control of the situation and what's the plan? ""DO NOT ACT BASED ON WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE. PRETEND IT'S COOL""

//fregrance.
Change of topic..

I love fregrance. U know what i also love? Color theory. Combining colors.. Wearing color combinations that i wouldn't have managed by myself if it wasn't for color wheels and sir google. I LOVE THAT. I've always been into fashion shows. But the color aspect is a newly found passion of mine.
Trying to find the hex code of the color between my hands is a mystery to solve. Then go look up the complimentary color and recently i learned there are several ways to calculate what color goes with what 😂
Trying to figure out if a color has a lot of gray in it. Or if its high in contrast
Me? Yes me. The thing is i look very unbothered on a daily basis.. U ask me what color is this and am like blue.. It can be cyan, light blue, navy,... Blue. Blue with a greenish touch! Sure.

I don't like the lazy aspect in me when it comes to having to talk to others. It puts me at a disadvantage of looking like ""u dont know nth JS..."" but in reality i might even know more than the person infront of me. I just never bothered to memorise how to articulate my facts. Hehe 😅

I still can't get myself to sleep. I wanna write endlessly but idk what to write abt. 

This shouldn't go on reddit for people to read.. I'm not even writing it on reddit.. I'm in someone's chat! Someone i met two days ago... 

Imagine waking up and ooooooh maaaa god.. This chick is craaaazy.. Lol

Birds.. Water.. Water. Do you know how much i LOVE water? It's a very tasty drink yet no one talks abt it! Whyyyyyyy. 
We should appreciate water more.

I wanna get up n pray. Praying at night when everyone is sleeping? I tried that couple of times and it's wonderful honestly. 
Especially when you have smth ure grateful abt or a pain in the ass bothering u n u have no to go to n u just 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨let go of it all.. 

It's hard to describe. But it feels nice. It feels almost like when u hug someone n just forget urself in them decharhing all the burden youve been carrying.. And tears fall as if they're pulled by the gravity

Now im tearing too 🤦

(not a cry baby Wellahi).. I either smile or look dead irl xD

Speaking of crying! I noticed a weird thing. This year. I leveled up in the level of honesty with myself and reached the hardest level. Emotions. And 🤦🤦🤦what have i done! I wish i didn't mess with the parameters i had going on. 

Now.. Yes I'm more empathetic and that's good. And (ect..) but i found mysef holding on to not show tears in family events. When my baby nephew was born and in his khtan party. It was joyful moments with lots n lots of zgharit yet i had to be the one holding her tears. At some point the second time it happened to me i thought to myself ""wtf mi.. What the hell is this?"". I really had to check myself afterwards. I was afraid it'd be smth else than joy. But not.. I was happy indeed.. I just unlocked a freaking weird feature. 

I dont like to appear infront of family like thaaaat 😭

I'm telling you.. This new feminine era is weird. And wild. But hey.. This is one of the advantages of being a human.. We get to experience many sides of ourselves.. Many many and there are many to come too.. 

**May allah bless us with wisdom and reason and keep foolishness far from us.** (say ameen if u got here) I'm usually calm and reasonable wellahi☝️🥺

I've been vegetarian on and off for around a year now, made the decision to go vegan a few days ago. I've been experiencing some tummy aches and sometimes feeling like im still hungry after just eating. I also feel a bit weak and sleepy but I can't tell if that's the winter season getting to me or the diet. I will be picking up some vitamin D tablets tomorrow. Getting a doctor's appointment where I live takes about a month so I was hoping to get advice here first. I'm worried I am not getting enough nutrients or something but to be honest, going back to being vegetarian will be a last resort for me.

  
For simplicity, I will share what I've been eating today since I don't vary too much in what I eat.

I had porridge with oat milk, a ramen bowl and home made katsu curry made with coconut milk and Lidl's schnitzel substitute (it's so delicious I recommend it in terms of taste). Had a few bits and bobs here and there (some vegan chocolate buttons and coffee)

After writing this I have actually noticed that's not enough calories in which case what else could I be having that fits in a daily schedule? Or does anyone have high calorie meal recommendations?

The freedom to work on your own terms sounds great… until you find yourself deep in a YouTube rabbit hole with nothing ticked off your to-do list.

It took me a while to realise that procrastination wasn’t a time issue, it was emotional. I wasn’t just avoiding tasks. I was avoiding the discomfort of starting. Fear of messing up, perfectionism, mental overload… all of it played a part.

What helped me shift:

* **Breaking tasks into tiny first steps** – if “write article” was too much, I’d just open the doc and write a title.
* **Setting timers** – I’ve seen a few articles about time management strategies, but the method that stuck with me is the Pomodoro Technique. You basically block 25 minutes of your time to get started without the pressure of finishing everything. I’m currently using the Forest app because I love its gamified feature. But I read that Jibble also offers a [free Pomodoro Timer](https://hubs.li/Q037hH1H0) on web that doesn’t require a login or subscription, so I might try that next.
* **Time tracking** – I use Jibble at work, and with its dashboard overview, I can easily tell whether I was productive or just pretending to be.
* **Tying tasks to habits** – I made it a rule: after coffee, open task list. It sounds small, but it worked.
* **Rewarding effort, not outcome** – Even ticking off one thing became worth celebrating.

The biggest change came from understanding that procrastination is about emotion, not laziness. Once I stopped waiting to feel motivated and just focused on starting small, things became easier to manage.

If procrastination still has a grip on you, this guide really helped me break things down: [How to Stop Procrastinating](https://www.jibble.io/article/stop-procrastinating)

We have great communication, he’s extremely kind, disciplined, responsible, and has supported me through some of the hardest periods of my life (especially dealing with my toxic family dynamic, my dad is a narcissist and my mom is emotionally abused).

The problem is: I keep having recurring panic attacks at night about our future together… even though day-to-day, I feel safe, regulated, and genuinely happy with him.

There’s no “big issue” just small things that feel big to me emotionally:
	•	We have a mismatch in financial habits. I come from a culture where men are very generous, and even my guy friends always pay for me. But my boyfriend is more practical. Example: he’s asked me to pay for my own coffee while standing beside him. He’s occasionally asked me to pay him back after he covers something. He only buys me gifts for birthdays, while I show love through gifting and acts of service.
	•	We’re from different economic backgrounds, but equally stable. The difference itself doesn’t bother me I’ve always cared more about ambition and generosity. What bothers me is the disconnect I sometimes feel in how we express love.
	•	Personality mismatch: he’s structured, grounded, predictable. I’m loud, eccentric, expressive, social. I worry I’ll end up in a very traditional, “contained” life that emotionally understimulates me. He does try to join me in my interests, but sometimes I feel like there’s a ceiling socially, emotionally, and economically.

Despite all this he is an amazing partner. Loving, supportive, stable. And I can picture a good life with him. I feel calm and regulated around him.

But the panic attacks keep coming. I communicate with him, the panic goes away… and then it returns weeks later. I’m scared this means I’m “forcing” myself.

Part of me wonders if I’m comparing this relationship to my first serious relationship which was very intense, passionate, socially compatible, and naturally aligned… but also extremely unstable. That breakup + my family trauma still affects me. I’m scared I’ve confused “comfort and stability” with “lack of excitement.”

I can’t tell if these worries are:
	•	genuine incompatibility
	•	trauma responses
	•	fear of repeating my parents’ toxic dynamic
	•	or grief over my first love who matched me socially/personality-wise

I don’t want to sabotage something good because of subconscious trauma, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags if they’re real.

Has anyone gone through this? How do I figure out what’s trauma vs what’s incompatibility?

I’m in a 3-year, serious and stable relationship with a man who is loving, kind, reliable, and emotionally safe. But I keep getting recurring panic attacks about our future even though day-to-day I feel calm and happy with him.",1,1764804721.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,0.66,False

Outdoorsy heart, geeky brain, animal lover. 🎮🖼️
Thoughtful, caring, and ready for someone loving, funny, and full of life.
Make me laugh, beat me at Halo (if you can), and let’s see where it goes.

The Long Version:
I’m someone who believes the best relationships are built on laughter, kindness, and genuine connection. Friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, and the kind of person who remembers the little things. I love the outdoors, whether it’s a peaceful hike, a day at the park, or just watching the sunset.

When I’m not outside, you might find me exploring my love for computers and video games, visiting a museum, or appreciating art in all its forms. Animals hold a special place in my heart, and I’m happiest when I’m sharing life with a fellow good-spirited soul.

What I’m Looking For
I’m hoping to meet someone loving, funny, and full of life, someone who’s up for adventures big and small, from deep conversations over coffee to spontaneous weekend getaways. A good heart and a great sense of humor are always welcome here.

If you’re looking for a partner who will listen, laugh, and grow with you, I’d love to hear from you.

I barely make enough money for my rent and bills. Let's forget about food or anything else. 

When I moved here, I was making a comfortable wage. But my contracts slowly started dying. 

I was able to afford my rent, bills, groceries, and car insurance and gas. I could take myself out to cirque du soleil once or twice a year (if they were here). I could go out to my favorite coffee shop (blenz), 2 or 3 times a month, for a hot chocolate and cinnamon bun. Maybe go out for dinner once a month or so. Get my nails done and a pedicure 3 or 4 times a year. 

Now?

I haven't gotten my hot chocolate since June. Haven't been out for dinner in over a year. It's been almost a year and a half since I had my nails done or a pedicure. 

It's been weeks since I've had an actual meal. Not just frozen fries or pizza. 

I don't have cable or anything else. I do have a smart TV, so I can watch tubi, LG channels, YouTube on my TV. Today tho, nothing on my TV is playing. The TV works, everything is loading... but nothing on tubi, LG, or even YouTube, is playing on my TV. 

I only turn the heat up enough so that it's not freezing. As soon as it starts to get warm, I turn it down just because I can't afford proper heating. 

I enjoy going out by myself, but I just can't get myself to go do anything anymore. I love doing my hair and makeup, getting dressed, and going out. Now, I basically sneak out to the grocery store around 9, wearing fleece pants and a sweatshirt, just to grab whatever I can happen to afford. 

My dog has a mass in his mouth, and I can't afford his testing, let alone any possible treatment. 

All I do all day is just sit on the couch, in my pj's, (usually) watch TV... always slightly chilled, under a blanket. 

I mean, I am absolutely pathetic. I dreamt of an exciting life. I didn't really know what that meant, but, it definitely wasn't this. 

Right now, I'm tempted to get rid of everything, drop my dog and cats off at a shelter, and just... go away...

Maybe then my Dippy can get treated. Maybe somebody who deserves an apartment can get this place (it isn't very nice, but, it's decent. And frankly, it's not as if I deserve it at all)

Just a few years ago, Cirque was in town. I didn't have anybody to go with, but I wanted to go. I got my nails done during the day, took myself out for dinner, grabbed my hot chocolate, and took transit to the show. I had a great day.

It's been such a wild ride going from wedding planning to actually living here, and we've learned SO much about both sides of Tulum - the destination wedding scene and what daily life actually looks like.

The funniest part is how many ""omg be careful"" articles our families keep forwarding us. Meanwhile we're just over here living our best life, finding our favorite local spots, making friends, and honestly wondering why we didn't do this sooner.

These are just some random moments from our first couple months - life in centro, local FOOD, the jungle and cenotes (we're in love with Neek), weekend beach days. Just regular days, but pretty incredible regular days. I'm a photographer so I can't help but document everything.

1pdjvmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/EckhartTolle/comments/1pdjvmu/enlightenedaligned_relationships/,Enlightened/Aligned Relationships,"Hello. I thought it would be interesting to create a Reddit, so here we are. Specifically, I am intrigued to be in a community with like-minded individuals and maybe even build connections but, at a minimum, get your perspective.

Aside from formal Eckhart Tolle retreats or the like, is there any kind of place or environment where you have met individuals interested in Tolle/awareness/spirituality? It can be tricky meeting potential (romantic) partners in niche spiritual events because there is a possibility of these individuals experiencing “spiritual ego” (per Tolle, in other words, this is when a person identifies themselves as someone spiritual and that they are more spiritual than most, have no ego, etc.). Admittedly, I was curious and asked ChatGPT - it said places like coffee shops, bookstores, and yoga sessions.

I guess a little backstory about me: I am a recently divorced woman (still in her 20s) who filed earlier this year (2025). Got married young and we grew apart. My ex husband and I still care for one another but we both know that we have learned what we could from each other and have come to terms with what is. We are on distinct spiritual paths.

That said, I feel completely unattached to him, everyone, and everything, really. The only longing I seem to have aside from sustaining myself and basic life necessities is an aligned/enlightened partner who can match my awareness, or at least not judge me or feel threatened by it. It’s hard when one’s neutrality is mistaken for hostility by a partner - all I have done and do is live in love and attempt to maintain my peace by living in the present moment, the Now.

I am in a point in my life where I feel complete and know that I do not need anyone, but there is a longing that I feel for companionship: holding hands, caresses, innocent and beautiful intimacy, affection, etc… a transference of energy.

I am not actively searching for an enlightened partner, but my heart is open and I remain present wherever I go. I have faith that what Rumi supposedly said is true, “What you seek is seeking you.” So, that’s why I am not looking because what is mine, is. What is yours, is yours. It’s a beautiful thing.

I just intuitively felt like posting. Sending my love and best vibes to you! 🥰🙏🏻✨",2,1764803988.0,EckhartTolle,1,1.0,False

Some hide the slow unmaking of a life. Behind 1E lives a woman drifting through the fading corridors of her own mind, her memories slipping through her grasp like water she can no longer hold. The building watches her gently, almost with pity, as the past she once cherished dissolves room by room. Behind 1E, she slips away quietly, one moment at a time. Tonight, we step into the soft unraveling of a life forgetting itself.”

-1E-

She wandered the hallway of her apartment with slow, uncertain steps as one hand trailed along the wall like she needed it to hold her up. She whispered to herself as she moved.

“I was… I was doing something… wasn’t I?”

Her voice had a trembling, papery thinness, like she was afraid of startling her own thoughts into hiding.

The faint scent of something tugged at her nose. Something unknown. Something important. She followed it into the kitchen, sniffing the air, checking the sink, the fridge, even the trash can. 
Nothing.
She opened the fridge again, checked the sink, the fridge again and the trash can. 
Nothing, still.

A knock startled her so sharply she clutched her own chest.

She opened the door to reveal a broad shouldered and gentle eyed man standing in the entrance of her apartment.

“Oh, sweetheart,” she said, soft and relieved. “You came home so fast.” 

He blinked, offering a sad smile. “It’s just me, ma’am. The super.”

Confusion flickered across her face like a shadow passing a window. Her words stuttered, afraid and apologetic. “Oh. Yes. Of course. I knew that. I just…something smells strange. I can’t find it.”

“I’ll take a look, ma’am.” he said kindly, stepping inside.

She followed him anxiously, hovering in doorways as he checked vents, pipes, and corners. Then he moved to her bedroom as the woman lingered behind him. 

“What does it smell like?” he asked, crouching by the bedroom vent.

She opened her mouth, and paused.
“It’s… I don’t know anymore,” she whispered. “It was something. Something from… somewhere.”

He stood, brushing off his hands.
“I don’t smell anything,” he said with regret in his voice but a soft smile curled on his face as he spoke to her gently. “But I’ll come back tomorrow. I’ll check everything here again and also the vents in the empty unit next door too, alright?”

She nodded gratefully.
“Thank you, sweetheart. It’s so nice to have you home.” 

He didn’t correct her this time.

When he left, the quiet swallowed the apartment. She drifted toward the back hallway, whispering the shapes of rooms under her breath as she pointed to each one in order. 

“Bathroom… hall closet… spare room… where was I…”

Then she stopped.

The tall, darkened doorway frame that led into her spare bedroom loomed in the short distance from her, but someone was standing in the frame. Not clearly. Just a silhouette. Her breath hitched. Not in fear, but in recognition.

“Is it…is that you?” she whispered, voice trembling with hope. “Baby…?” She stepped closer to the door.
“Son?”

The figure slipped into the room without sound, and she followed, drawn by something deep in her bones.

The moment she stepped through the doorway, the room changed.

The beige carpet brightened into blue carpet, the one that he had her and his dad install when he was twelve. The ribbons of accomplishments and the posters of half remembered bands appeared tacked onto the white plaster walls. A suit jacket hung on the door.

And he was there, beautiful, alive, standing in front of the mirror with nervous, fumbling hands trying to fix a tie.

“Mom,” he said, laughing lightly. “I can’t get this stupid thing right.”

She felt tears gather instantly as motherly instincts took over and she moved over to stand before the frame of her son. 
“Oh…oh, sweetheart, here. Let me.”
Her hands moved automatically, fixing the knot like she’d done a hundred times before.

He swallowed hard. “Thanks mom.”
He let out a long breathy sigh that seemed, at least to her, to hold more weight and a lingering hollow feeling hidden within it.
“This is it, mom. I’m leaving.”

“What? Leaving? Son, what are you…what do you mean?”

He touched her arm gently, smiling through something she couldn’t understand. “I have to go.”

The form of her son hugged her, released, and walked toward the doorway as his edges began to break apart. He smiled. That same smile that he had given her so many times when she had him in her life. The kind that says, “I love you,” without any words needed.
His shirt faded first, then his hands, then his face.
He gave her one more soft, heartbreaking look, and vanished.

The room dissolved around her like melting paper. She blinked. She was alone in a dim spare bedroom she barely recognized.

“What…what was I doing in here?”
Her voice was small.

She backed into the hallway when the smell of saltwater pushed past her. The sounds of gulls calling through breezy air and the subtle crash of waves started to etch their echoes around the room. She turned toward a framed photo on the wall. One of two young women laughing at the beach. She stared at the picture feeling cool wind and warm sun beams on her skin when, suddenly, a hand rested gently on her shoulder. She turned.

A woman in her mid thirties stood beside her. She was vibrant and lovely wearing a huge straw hat, a yellow sunflower patterned sundress and huge mirror framed sunglasses that reflected the image of the older woman. 
Her best friend.
The old woman stood there, looking at her, sunlit and smiling, the way she always was and always would be to her, when she was in her thirties. “It’s beautiful here, isn’t it?” the image murmured. The older woman’s breath shuddered.

“I miss you,” she whispered. “I…I have missed you. Where did you go?” Her friend nodded softly. 

“Oh no baby, I didn’t go anywhere. I was here. Just buried in so much noise that it took me this long to cut through it all and see you one last time.”
They both gave each other an embrace that felt like reuniting and never leaving all at once. That is until the words her friend just said bent back around to the forefront of her mind.
“One last time? What do you mean?” She said, hands still gripping her friend as she pushes back seeing her reflection again in the sunglasses hanging on her face. 
“Sadly, I can’t stay. And neither can you my dear. You have to go back, and I…well I just have to go.”

“What do you mean? Go where?”

“I’m sorry,” her friend whispered, the voice already fading. “I don’t want to, but I must go. And you do too.” The sunlight dimmed. The warmth dissolved. The beach unraveled.

She blinked, and the photo in her hands was empty. Empty of meaning. Just a frame with nothing inside. Nothing inside that she remembered. 

She stood inside the hallway holding a meaningless trinket that didn’t even garner a longing glance from her eyes as a new scent reached her next.
Coffee, strong, warm, familiar. A tall, trembling shadow passed through the kitchen doorway.
Her heart lurched, as she placed the frame that pictured someone she didn’t know down on the end table. 

“No,” she whispered. “No… it can’t be…” She steadied herself on the wall, shuffling toward the kitchen, guided more by fear than curiosity. She turned the corner, and the room shifted.

Her husband’s favorite mug was on the counter. The old coffeemaker sputtered softly. He stood there, aging face full of love and sadness.

“Honey,” he said warmly. “Sit down. I’ll make you a cup.”

She obliged him, she always did and she collapsed into the chair like it was the only solid thing in the world as he walked slowly over to bring her a fresh cup, setting it on the table beside her.  He knelt down next to her, taking the hand of his one and only love into his. 

“I need to tell you something.”

She swallowed, nodding.

“I loved you. Have always loved you. Every day. From the moment we met, to our wedding, to the day our son was born. Through everything. Even after the world took him from us. Took me away from you.”
Her lip trembled. “Loved? Do you not, right now? Love me?”
He glanced with a smile at her saddened expression holding a smile she remembered from a half faded memory. “Oh honey,” he said softly, “I have loved, love, and will love you always. Even when there isn’t a remnant of me that remains, my love will.” 
They both stared in each other’s eyes for a solid beat of time. Their ageless longing for each other never subsided and never wained. Yet, his next impulse was not his choice, he had no decision to make here, only the act. He stood, “But now, my love, I must leave you. Even though I wish nothing more than to stay.”
“Then don’t go,” she begged. “Please don’t go.”

His thumb brushed over her fingers, warm, familiar, heartbreaking.

“I have to,” he whispered. “And soon you won’t remember I was even here, or why this hurts to begin with.”

“No, if you leave me…I…how will I find you? How would I ever learn to live without you?”

He kissed her hand one last time.

“Baby,” he hesitated as he stood and looked at her, as if trying to take in all of her, every molecule, “I’m not even here now sweetie.”

“I’m…I don’t understand.”

His outline thinned.
His eyes faded.
His voice disappeared.
And the kitchen snapped back into the dim, modern space she lived in.
She stared at a cold coffee mug covered in a thin layer of dust that sat on the table.

“Why… why am I crying?” she whispered, touching her wet cheeks with shaking fingers. She began wiping them away, with no recollection of even why they were there in the first place. 

As she sat rubbing her palms down her cheeks she immediately froze with her hands halfway between her eyes and jawline. The smell that coalesced in the air fired off neurons in her brain bringing forth a long dormant memory. She couldn’t connect the dots in her weary mind of why it was here but she knew every particle of the scent and exactly from what place it belonged to.

It was floral, it was sweet and it was covered in love as it floated past her, filling her nostrils as if begging her to come find it. 

She slowly rose from the chair in her barren kitchen and walked out into the living room. The space did not resemble the current drab living arrangements of her own apartment but instead looked like a memory long pushed into recesses so deep that the sight of her new surroundings felt like an old lover wrapping her in a warm embrace. 

Warm firelight flickered on polished wood floors. Flowers glowing with color in pots arranged on the mantle and window sills brought a bursting of color to entire room. The memory took shape as the space that once occupied the area slowly gave way to the powerful image of where she was, had been, and held steady and exact. 
 
A cottage.
Soft. Safe.
That long forgotten place.
Home.

Standing behind a brushed brown colored couch were the vague silhouettes of far forgotten outlines of people she couldn’t quite place. Frames of vapor that seemed to hold shapes of only ages. Young, vibrant, loving. They stood without motion…watching her, waiting.

She walked over, stood tentatively before the outlines, squinting her eyes as if trying to gain an inkling of a reminder of what they are, who they are, or were, or should be. She blinked rubbed her eyes and felt her body ache and turned slowly before the feeling of fatigue grabbed her and she took a seat with a sigh on the sofa. Her hands stretched over the fabric of the cushions the material edging around her fingertips as a smile found its place. She hadn’t sat here in so long but she knew every detail. 

Then, delicate, soft footsteps interrupted the somber remembrance. 
A presence warm like sunlight entered the cozy cottage from a life she once knew. 
A beautiful young woman stepped from the shadows.
Confident.
Alive.
Gentle.

“Hey there, sweetheart,” it said softly. “I’m here.”

The old woman’s lips parted.
“I… I know you. I’m…you’re…me?”

“That’s right,” the younger self whispered, kneeling in front of her. “Hey there, lovely.”

She took the old woman’s hand in both of hers. She clasped them ever so gently before looking up to meet her own gaze. 

And then she spoke.

“Hey… look at me. I’m right here. I’m the last piece of you left, you know. Everyone else…the memories, the people, the moments you loved…they’ve already gone.
And now it’s just us. Just you and me. I wish you hadn’t had to grow old without them.
Without me.
I didn’t want you to carry everything alone. But you did. For so long. Longer than any heart should have to.
You’re scared.
I know.
But you’ve been scared for years, haven’t you? Trying so hard to hold on when your own mind kept turning against you. Your memory failing you piece by piece…like an ever present, slow moving coup,
quiet and patient, taking your life one room at a time while you stood there helpless.
Trying to remember faces that should’ve been impossible to forget. Trying to stay here…even when here stopped making sense.
I’m sorry.
I’m so, so sorry you had to do all of this by yourself. You don’t deserve this kind of ending. This slow unmaking. You deserved warmth, and company, and someone to tell you it’s alright when the lights go out. But this is where we are.
You and me, in the last quiet corner of your mind.
And…I need you to hear something.
When I go, there won’t be anything left to fear. There won’t be anything left to hurt you. There won’t be anything left at all.
But you won’t feel alone.
I promise.
There will be nothing left inside you to feel lonely with. Please don’t cry…you’re forgetting me already.
See? You’re looking right through me. I’m fading even as you try to hold on.
You weren’t supposed to watch me disappear. I was supposed to be the one who lived. Lived on through you. But it’s all going backwards now.
When I’m gone… you’ll be safe. Empty, but safe.
And I hope…
God, I hope…
some small part of you remembers that someone once loved you. Even if it was only me. Even if it was only the girl you used to be.”

The figures behind her faded first, softly, quietly, like dust settling.

Then her younger self, her last memory, the last bit of her, 
smiled through tears and whispered, “Goodbye, sweetheart. I love you.”

And she dissolved like smoke blown apart by a breeze.

The cottage room snapped back into her dim apartment. The old woman sat alone on the floor, tears streaking her face.
She looked around, confused.
Lost.
Hollow.

“Why…why am I…here?” she whispered.

Then, softer:

“Who…who am I?”

Her voice broke into a small, frightened whimper. She covered her eyes with trembling hands, rocking in the silence. And only the apartment held her, empty, quiet, waiting, as the last of her faded into the dark.

“In the end, the tenant of 1E doesn’t leave, she simply disappears, one fading thought at a time. There is no finale to a mind unraveling, only the soft collapse of everything that once held her together until even the collapse goes quiet. When the last of her slips away, the building exhales and closes the door behind her. Another life reduced to gentle, devastating nothing, and added to the ever growing ledger. Next week, we climb to Unit 5C, where forgetting is a mercy the tenant will never be granted, because his memories don’t fade. They fight back.”

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Hooves hammered through dust thick enough to chew, carbines slung low, sabers useless weight against the saddle, and the wind carrying that quiet warning the prairie gave right before it bared its teeth. The men of the 9th and 10th U.S. Cavalry didn’t move like new regiments—they carried themselves with the grim assurance of people who’d already survived a country that barely wanted them alive. The noise of the march said all of it: discipline at the edges, violence beneath, and a slivered patience that snapped fast if pushed.

Somewhere ahead, a war party moved—Kiowa, Comanche, Cheyenne—names the officers whispered like weather reports. The troopers didn’t need the details. They looked into the blank horizon, reading it the way other men read Scripture: the sudden darkening of the sky, an unnatural stillness in the grass, a hawk spiraling low. They knew the difference between quiet and ambush like they knew the taste of ration coffee or the weight of disrespect in a white officer’s voice. Embers of old battles followed them. Shiloh. Appomattox. The last places they’d fought under a flag that promised much and delivered thinly.

1pdjqrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1pdjqrd/im_in_a_stable_loving_relationship_but_get_panic/,"I’m in a stable, loving relationship but get panic attacks about our future, is this incompatibility or unresolved trauma?","I (26F) am in a very serious relationship of 3 years with a man (30M) I truly love and see a future with. We have great communication, he’s extremely kind, disciplined, responsible, and has supported me through some of the hardest periods of my life (especially dealing with my toxic family dynamic, my dad is a narcissist and my mom is emotionally abused).

The problem is: I keep having recurring panic attacks at night about our future together… even though day-to-day, I feel safe, regulated, and genuinely happy with him.

There’s no “big issue” just small things that feel big to me emotionally:
	•	We have a mismatch in financial habits. I come from a culture where men are very generous, and even my guy friends always pay for me. But my boyfriend is more practical. Example: he’s asked me to pay for my own coffee while standing beside him. He’s occasionally asked me to pay him back after he covers something. He only buys me gifts for birthdays, while I show love through gifting and acts of service.
	•	We’re from different economic backgrounds, but equally stable. The difference itself doesn’t bother me I’ve always cared more about ambition and generosity. What bothers me is the disconnect I sometimes feel in how we express love.
	•	Personality mismatch: he’s structured, grounded, predictable. I’m loud, eccentric, expressive, social. I worry I’ll end up in a very traditional, “contained” life that emotionally understimulates me. He does try to join me in my interests, but sometimes I feel like there’s a ceiling socially, emotionally, and economically.

Despite all this he is an amazing partner. Loving, supportive, stable. And I can picture a good life with him. I feel calm and regulated around him.

But the panic attacks keep coming. I communicate with him, the panic goes away… and then it returns weeks later. I’m scared this means I’m “forcing” myself.

Part of me wonders if I’m comparing this relationship to my first serious relationship which was very intense, passionate, socially compatible, and naturally aligned… but also extremely unstable. That breakup + my family trauma still affects me. I’m scared I’ve confused “comfort and stability” with “lack of excitement.”

I can’t tell if these worries are:
	•	genuine incompatibility
	•	trauma responses
	•	fear of repeating my parents’ toxic dynamic
	•	or grief over my first love who matched me socially/personality-wise

I don’t want to sabotage something good because of subconscious trauma, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags if they’re real.

Has anyone gone through this? How do I figure out what’s trauma vs what’s incompatibility?

TL:Dr

I’m in a 3-year, serious and stable relationship with a man who is loving, kind, reliable, and emotionally safe. But I keep getting recurring panic attacks about our future even though day-to-day I feel calm and happy with him.",4,1764803657.0,whatdoIdo,5,0.83,False

1pdjim5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pdjim5/im_f26_in_a_stable_loving_relationship_m30_but/,"I’m (F26) in a stable, loving relationship (M30) but get panic attacks about our future, is this incompatibility or unresolved trauma?","I (26F) am in a very serious relationship of 3 years with a man I truly love and see a future with. We have great communication, he’s extremely kind, disciplined, responsible, and has supported me through some of the hardest periods of my life (especially dealing with my toxic family dynamic, my dad is a narcissist and my mom is emotionally abused).

The problem is: I keep having recurring panic attacks at night about our future together… even though day-to-day, I feel safe, regulated, and genuinely happy with him.

There’s no “big issue” just small things that feel big to me emotionally:
	•	We have a mismatch in financial habits. I come from a culture where men are very generous, and even my guy friends always pay for me. But my boyfriend is more practical. Example: he’s asked me to pay for my own coffee while standing beside him. He’s occasionally asked me to pay him back after he covers something. He only buys me gifts for birthdays, while I show love through gifting and acts of service.
	•	We’re from different economic backgrounds, but equally stable. The difference itself doesn’t bother me I’ve always cared more about ambition and generosity. What bothers me is the disconnect I sometimes feel in how we express love.
	•	Personality mismatch: he’s structured, grounded, predictable. I’m loud, eccentric, expressive, social. I worry I’ll end up in a very traditional, “contained” life that emotionally understimulates me. He does try to join me in my interests, but sometimes I feel like there’s a ceiling socially, emotionally, and economically.

Despite all this he is an amazing partner. Loving, supportive, stable. And I can picture a good life with him. I feel calm and regulated around him.

But the panic attacks keep coming. I communicate with him, the panic goes away… and then it returns weeks later. I’m scared this means I’m “forcing” myself.

Part of me wonders if I’m comparing this relationship to my first serious relationship which was very intense, passionate, socially compatible, and naturally aligned… but also extremely unstable. That breakup + my family trauma still affects me. I’m scared I’ve confused “comfort and stability” with “lack of excitement.”

I can’t tell if these worries are:
	•	genuine incompatibility
	•	trauma responses
	•	fear of repeating my parents’ toxic dynamic
	•	or grief over my first love who matched me socially/personality-wise

I don’t want to sabotage something good because of subconscious trauma, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags if they’re real.

Has anyone gone through this? How do I figure out what’s trauma vs what’s incompatibility?

TL:Dr

I’m in a 3-year, serious and stable relationship with a man who is loving, kind, reliable, and emotionally safe. But I keep getting recurring panic attacks about our future even though day-to-day I feel calm and happy with him.",1,1764803096.0,BreakUps,2,0.66,False

Today I ticked multiple things off the list! After almost five years of transition... I got called pretty, told I had a nice rack, and I caused a man to walk into traffic... Let me explain...","Let’s start at the beginning…

I was chatting with an older lady who lives near me. We bumped into each other in the doctor’s office. She was a bit upset that I don’t always say hello, so I explained that because I’m autistic, I often wear headphones just to stay grounded and focused, And I told her that ""I promise I would never ignore you!"". She took that in her stride.  
Then she looks at me and says, “Look, just because you’re pretty, don’t think I’ll let you off next time you ignore me!”

Bonus points here because I’m a 45-year-old white woman, and she was an older Black Jamaican woman. That smile, that accent, that compliment… 150% win.

Next up…  


I was talking to the receptionist at the same doctor’s office. We’ve built a pretty solid bond over the last year or three, and I’ve started to think of her as a friend. Whenever I walk in she instantly smiles a broad and genuine smile. She’s genuinely curious about trans issues and always asks questions because she wants to learn. I make sure to remind her that I can only speak for myself, not for every trans person, though. We even agreed to grab coffee this week so I can talk her through what I’m going through, in my own words.

Anyway… the topic of physical changes came up. We talked about periods, emotions, skin, the whole mix. Then I mentioned my bad back. She forgot herself for a moment and said, verbatim:  
“It’s probably because you have an impressive rack!”

There was a pause when she caught the slang… and then, “I mean, you’ve had noticeable chest growth over the last few years.”

I smiled and told her I’m a 38DD/E, but the family average is G/H. She wasn’t sure how to respond and just said, “… nice.”

(A life full of trauma and autism means I’m usually blind to compliments. I never really got them before. So I’m still learning how to process that.)

Finally…  


I’m a big woman... 6’, about 240 lbs, muscle-momma energy, and I was walking down a busy road at night on my own. (Yes, yes, terrible idea, I know.)

The path got narrow, and I saw a shadow behind me moving fast. I turned around and found myself looking slightly upward into the face of a much bigger fish in the pond. A few inches taller than me, broader arms, probably a builder, and clearly strong.

He looked me in the eyes… and then almost immediately looked down and slowed his pace. He put distance between us. I moved aside so he could pass, and he did...  but first he backed off, waited for a break in traffic, and walked into the road to give me a wide berth.

This dude, who absolutely could’ve folded me like laundry, chose instead to avoid my eyes and literally walk in traffic to not intimidate me.

And don’t get me wrong... this shouldn’t be remarkable. It shouldn’t have to happen at all. But… no man would do that for another guy.

So I think… I think I made it? I think people see me for who I really am... finally.

Look... Transition is slow and messy and terrifying and beautiful. But every now and then you get these little moments... these tiny, ridiculous, unexpected affirmations that quietly whisper, *“You’re not pretending. You’re becoming.”*

If you’re still in the thick of it, or if you’re scared you’ll never be seen: hold on. Sometimes the world recognizes you long before you learn to recognize yourself. And those moments are worth everything.",13,1764802957.0,trans,1,0.92,False

I’ve been interested in penpaling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in the many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I’ve been fortunate enough to have people to exchange with, and I’d like to see if I can find that again.

I’m looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. I want to actually get to know my penpal.

I do have a preference for cultural exchange in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you’re my state or half the world away, it’s you, the person, I want to exchange with.

I'm interested in both a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items, and a digital e-mail exchange. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I want us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let’s become familiar with each other to make sure we’re a good fit. I'm open to an e-mail exchange more readily.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I’m designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, hence the lure of elongated methods of communication.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it’s too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young. I’m most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I’m always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

1pdjgbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/1pdjgbl/my_experience_so_far/,My experience so far,"So I'm sitting in the airport bar right now doom scrolling through iracing subreddit. After having a few beers waiting for a delayed flight suddenly my view feels a bit more important. 

I made a few mistakes in my first nine months. 

1. Instead of finding a class of car I sampled everything with zero direction. I would jump from oval to sport to open wheel randomly throughout a session and make zero progression. Though racing oval always ended up being a confidence boost. Sorry to the oval guys and I'm prepared for the down vote, but if I want to grab a win while sipping coffee I'll usually jump into an oval race. 

I really do wish that I focused on masterering a car or at least for comfortable with a car before jumping around. I really feel like it did way more damage than good. 

2. Financially I'm ok. But I really wish I had gotten comfortable reading the calendar and purchase my tracks for the week ahead of time. I've spent so much on tracks the day before a change and barely got to enjoy them. It's a dumb one and a waste of money. Especially when you probably won't see these tracks for a whole year.

3. I really wish, and this is my biggest regret, I hadn't chased irating. I got into my head that I had to be an ""A"" sports car driver. To hell with irating. Now I'm at 700 irating racing with guys that would be much happier driving bumper cars. I'm winning some races and gaining the rating but I'm sure my blood pressure would be much lower if I was racing guys with a 2k irating.

Anyways those are my regrets. What are yours?
