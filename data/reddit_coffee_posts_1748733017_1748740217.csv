Look, I get it.  For $40 how can a company possibly give you their software forever.  It's just crappy that this is an ""accepted"" method of launching and marketing software.  

Did I get $40 worth of value out of the tool over the last 10 months that I've had it? Yes.  

Did SEO Co-Pilot know when they offered a ""Life Time Deal"" that they would terminate it? Maybe?

Again, I get it if you want to launch a ""Life Time Deal"" that is limited in some way.  And your goal is to get the LTD owners to upgrade to a paid plan to get the added features.  But canceling a deal that you made because your business model isn't working the way you intended, feels like fraud.

If they went out of business that's one thing.  But they just decided to terminate the LTDs and keep the paying customers.

This is just an FYI to all other LTD buyers, keep your expectations in line.

1l0cmwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1l0cmwc/fxm_the_hum_of_new_neighbors/,[FXM] The Hum of New Neighbors,"I‚Äôd only known him for a few weeks, both of us having recently moved into the same building. At first, it was just the usual neighborly stuff‚Äîpolite hellos in the hallway, small talk in the elevator. But today... today was different.

I was at his apartment, after he'd casually invited me over for coffee. What started as a simple visit had somehow morphed into something else. We ended up talking for hours‚Äîabout life, about moving in, about how chaotic everything had been. And then, at some point, I found myself tidying up his place.

The kitchen was cluttered with the remnants of yesterday‚Äôs dinner, and the apartment in general was far from clean. I didn‚Äôt mind, though. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt mind at all. Cleaning felt almost... calming, like it gave me some sense of control in this new, unfamiliar place. It wasn‚Äôt much of a chore. Scrubbing a stubborn spot off the counter, I felt a strange sense of satisfaction.

I hummed quietly as I worked, rinsing a plate before setting it down on the drying rack. The gentle clink of the dishes was a welcome sound, like a small rhythm I could follow. It felt natural, easy.

What didn‚Äôt feel so easy was the way he was watching me. He hadn‚Äôt said anything‚Äîhadn‚Äôt made any demands‚Äîbut his presence was... overwhelming, somehow. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like I was doing exactly what he wanted, though he never asked for anything. I tried not to think about it, but I felt his gaze on me, warm but intense.

I turned to place a glass on the counter, only to find that he was standing much closer than I‚Äôd expected. How had he gotten so near? I hadn‚Äôt even noticed him moving.

His eyes met mine, deep and unreadable, and I felt my heart skip a beat. The air between us felt thick, like something unsaid was hanging there, just out of reach.

I hadn‚Äôt realized how close he‚Äôd gotten until his presence was practically right behind me. I could feel his warmth, and suddenly, everything felt charged‚Äîlike my breath was stuck in my chest, my hands frozen.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing, sweetheart?‚Äù His voice was soft, almost a whisper, like it carried something heavier than the words themselves. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do all of this for me.‚Äù

The question hung in the air, and I felt my pulse race. The space between us seemed to shrink, even though neither of us had moved. My fingers trembled slightly as I placed the dish back down, trying to ignore the way the tension between us was building.

Before I could say anything, his hand brushed mine, guiding it gently away from the counter. His touch was firm, but not demanding‚Äîalmost protective, yet not overbearing. He wasn‚Äôt pushing me; he was just... there.

I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was doing‚Äîor even what I wanted to do‚Äîbut the pull between us was undeniable. The way he made me feel, even without saying much, made everything seem more intense than it should‚Äôve been.

And now I had to ask myself: How far would I let this go?

1l0cma3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotorcycleMentor/comments/1l0cma3/front_vs_rear_brakes_a_discussion_of_purpose_and/,Front vs. Rear Brakes - A discussion of Purpose and Use,"I see a lot of confusion from newer riders about what each of the brakes on their bike is for and how to best use them to stay safe, go fast, or both, so I wanted to have a little discussion describing the use of each of your brakes.  I'm going to talk about some basic topics, but also touch on some advanced use as it helps explain the ""why"" of the basic topics.  I'll also touch on why they are engineered the way they are.

You can look at brakes simply, or you can recognize that the brakes on your bike are the most important component for both going fast and being safe.  The simple look at it is:  Brakes slow you down.  Okay... we've gotten past that, now we can get into what they really do.  They change your bike's geometry on the fly.  Once you understand that the geometry change is your brakes super power, you can begin to utilize them for more than just stopping your bike.

# Front vs. Rear

Stop reading and go look at your bike.  It is the same as my bike, and every other bike out there in a couple ways, but the most important is that the front rotors and calipers are bigger than the rear rotor and caliper.  Faster bikes even have 2 big rotors and calipers up front compared to just 1 smaller rotor in the back (please excuse any discussion of drum brakes or any other truly abnormal configuration).  That difference should be communicating something to you right off the bat.

*The people that engineered your bike intend for the majority of your stopping power to come from the front brakes.*

Taking that visually obvious thing into consideration, the other big indicator is the front brakes are controlled with your hand, which is a precise way to control things, vs. your rear being controlled with your foot which is a more blunt way to control things.  People spout a lot of ratios, but commonly you hear something like your front brakes are about 90% of your stopping power on most bikes (some claim 70% on cruisers).

Your front brake is your stopping brake and controls your front suspension.  Your rear brake is for stability and finesse, with minor additional stopping power, and it controls your rear suspension.

# Bike Geometry

So what happens to your bike's geometry when you use each of the brakes?  What even is bike geometry???  Bike geometry is a fairly simple to understand, but difficult to master topic, so we'll touch on the basics here.  Mastering your bike's geometry is an advance topic that unless you are racing and chasing tenths, you really don't need to delve too far into.

Think of the bike's geometry as referring to the changing shape of your bike.  You might not realize it, but the distance between your two wheels is constantly changing as you ride.  The trail of your bike constantly changes. And your rear end changes height constantly.  Most of these changes affect two opposite things:  How quickly your bike steers and how stable it feels.  You generally get one at the cost of the other.

**Wheelbase**

When you squeeze the front brake, your forks compress.  When your forks compress, you are effectively shortening the wheelbase of your bike.  Think about it.  The forks slide up into themselves when they compress.  They are at a forward angle, so if they compress, they bring the front wheel closer to the rest of the bike.  If your wheels are closer together, they will turn the bike much quicker.  If the forks fully extend, it lengthens the wheelbase and makes your bike feel much more stable in a straight line, but if you try to turn in this state, your bike will feel sluggish in comparison.  So whenever you see a motorcycle with an extended swingarm (longer wheelbase), just know that unless it was built specifically for drag racing or roll racing, even though the owner might think it looks cool, it is severely hurting how well the bike turns.

**Trail**

If you draw a line through the steering pivot on your bike towards the ground, that line will hit the ground in front of where the wheel is in contact with the ground.  The measurement from that line's intersection to the center point of the wheel contacting the ground is called your trail measurement.  If your forks are more vertical, the trail number decreases.  If your forks are pushed out further in front, the number increases.  Less trail is similar to shortening the wheelbase... Quicker turn in.  Higher trail means more straight line stability.  That's why sportbike forks are more vertical and cruiser forks are swept forward more.  They have different purposes, so they are built differently.  When squeeze the front brake and your forks compress, the trail number gets smaller.  Which means the bike turns in faster.  When the forks fully extend... you guessed it.  More straight line stability and harder to turn the bike.

**Squat**

Squat refers to your tail dropping.  Basically your rear wheel pivoting upwards around the swingarm pivot drops the butt of your bike.  There's two reasons your bike squats.  1)  you give the bike some throttle, and as the wheel spins up, the rear will squat down.  2)  you get on the rear brake.  Frequently people try to avoid squatting under throttle.  You'll hear about techniques and mods to achieve ""anti-squat"" to keep the rear up under acceleration, but that's not why we're here (when your bike squats under accelerations, it also shifts weight backwards, extending your forks, and reducing your ability to turn the bike easily).  Squat under deceleration adds a bit of stability as you slow down and initiate lean.  It helps you feel more stable and dig in as you are turning the bike.  You purposefully add this bit of squat before you squeeze the front brakes.  This is different than when accelerating as your front forks do not extend in this scenario.

Between the wheelbase shortening, your trail reducing, your bike squatting and becoming more stable as you lean, AND your front tire contact patch growing significantly, it's almost as your bike's brake system was intentionally designed with the express goal of making your bike turn easier.  And here you thought your brakes were just to slow you down...

# Emergency Braking

I've touched on this in [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MotorcycleMentor/comments/1kp8neg/the_connection_between_fear_vision_and_brakes/), but the primary use for your braking system is to stop.  Simple.  When you are training to stop, you should be training to stop quickly.  IF you can shave even 5 feet off your stopping distance, that could be the difference between hitting the broad side of a car that pulled out in front of you, or telling your friends and family about a close call you had.  If stopping hard is the goal, you want to work your way up to using both brakes, but start by training how to use the front brake to stop.

When you go to stop hard, what you shouldn't do is just grab a fistful of brakes.  I've talked about this elsewhere, but what i just used was abrupt language.  Abruptness on a motorcycle is bad.  You can do things very quickly, but if you do them abruptly, you give your bike inputs that destabilize it.  What you really want to do is focus on the first 5% of your input.  Smoothly apply the first 5% of brake pressure with your hand (this can take a fraction of a second, but it isn't a grab) to apply the brake pads to the rotors which will immediately begin to compress your forks, and in turn, increase the size of the contact patch of your front tire.  Once your tire and suspension are loaded, you are free to quickly squeeze as much brake as you want to slow the bike down.  Again, don't grab it, stab it, yank it, etc.  Squeeze it.  Progressively, purposefully, and if you need to, quickly.

Most riders will never find the limit of how much you can squeeze your front brake, but there are two key indicators.  1: Your ABS kicks on and you feel a pulsation through the lever.  You should try to engage the ABS in a parking lot one day so you can know what it feels like.  It is honestly quite startling the first time you feel it, so try to gain that knowledge in a safe environment instead of trying to avoid hitting a stationary object.  2: Your rear wheel comes off the ground.  If you stabbed the brakes, you can lift the rear quite easily, and it is quite dangerous.  If you are progressively squeezing your brakes, you will likely lift the rear wheel before tripping your ABS.  It likely won't be very high, but you'll feel it come up.  It will likely scare the crap out of you the first time.  That's fine... you are just trying to find your limits.

Now that you know how to find the limit of your front brake, practice it.  You'll get used to the sensations of braking hard.  You'll get used to how much your weight shifts forward.  It's not as scary as it sounds.  Once you get comfortable stopping hard with your front brake, start practicing stopping hard in a turn.  It really isn't any different besides standing the bike up as you come to a stop.  This is a useful skill for highway guys since you never know what is at the end of an off ramp.

Okay...  Now to add in the rear brake and a geometry super power.  When you apply the rear brake, the rear of your bike squats.  You compress the shock a bit, but the bigger things is the whole rear of the bike lowers a bit.  You can practice using the rear brake the same way as the front.  Apply that same 5% then press it down all the way smoothly.  Practice with just the rear brake, from progressively faster speeds to get used to the feel.  You'll notice your stopping distance is MUCH longer than with the front brake.  Then, the next time you practice emergency braking with the front, apply the rear brake (following the same 5% and then more as before) just before you apply the front brake.  You'll find that your bike feels much more stable than it did with just the front brake, mainly because your bike isn't diving forward as much or as quickly since the rear of the bike squatted first.  It won't shave huge distances off your stopping distance, but it will save you a little bit, but more importantly it will feel more planted.

**Front** to stop.  **Rear** to stabilize.  **Both** for maximum stopping ability.

# The Butler Stop

Once you have a good feel for how strong your brakes are, start practicing what I refer to as ""The Butler Stop"".  This of this as the in-between step between learning emergency braking and trail braking (more on that in a moment).  ""The Butler Stop"" is likely how you have been stopping your car for most of your driving career.  You don't emergency brake to a stop sign.  That would be crazy.  Instead, you get a bunch of your braking done quickly until you feel safe and confident that you will complete the stop with plenty of excess space, then you ease off the brake smoothly until you come to a controlled gentle stop at the desired position.  Some might say that you *trail* off the brake until you come to a stop.  wink wink.

The point is, you should practice trailing off the brake in a straight line to a complete stop to get used to the feel of your brakes.  You are practicing smooth control.  You can always tell new riders when the come to a stop sign.  It is never the smooth, confident stop of someone that knows their brake levers intimately.

Start your practice with no stopping point in mind (so give yourself plenty of runoff space just in case... lol).  Just focus on trailing off the brake smoothly and coming to a stop that is so smooth that if an imaginary cup of coffee was sitting on your tank, it wouldn't spill a drop when you finally stop.  That's the level of smoothness you are looking for.

Once you have achieved that level of smoothness and control of the brakes, then start targeting an actual stopping point and coming to a butler stop at a specific line on the street.

Notice I didn't specify a brake to use.  I expect at this point, you are using the front brake for stopping power and the rear for stability.  That is no different here.  Ideally you will use both, but if you don't feel comfortable with the rear yet, that's fine.  You can practice this very effectively with just the front brake.  If you are not comfortable with the front brake yet, well... go back to emergency braking and learn the front brake before even considering going riding on the street.

Once you are really good at this, you are ready to delve into trail braking.  You'll use the skill and lever feel you just developed here, and add turning the bike into the mix.

# Trail Braking

This post isn't going to go in depth into what trail braking is and how to do it.  [There's another post for that](https://www.reddit.com/r/MotorcycleMentor/comments/1kokcr0/trail_braking_not_scary_not_an_advanced_technique/).  This post is going to discuss the purpose of each brake while trail braking though.

If you guessed that the front is going to be used to slow the bike down so you can turn the bike and the rear is going to be used to lower the tail of the bike, add stability and give you really fine control of your turning radius... well... You'd be correct.  If you are going to use your rear brake, same as above, initiate the rear first. and trail off as needed.  A lot of people don't use the rear brake when turning at all.  And that's fine.  But it will give you finer control, so even if you aren't using it at this phase in your riding, make it a future goal.

A quick rehash of trail braking is to focus on the first and last few percent of brake pressure.  Load the tire and suspension with a touch of brakes, then quickly squeeze to get to the maximum braking pressure you intend to use and scrub off a bunch of speed quickly, then as you tip in to the turn and lean your bike over, progressively ease off your brakes as you add lean angle until you get to the slowest point of the turn.  All the while, if you need to tighten your line, you can, with either brake, honestly.  If you have already gotten to neutral throttle though, only use the rear brake to tighten your line.

The catch phrase to remember for trail braking:  Carry the brakes past tip in.  Refer to the post linked above for more detail.

# The Thumb Brake

This is a bit of a bonus topic.  I'm sure a lot of you have seen the alternate rear brake setups on professional race bikes.  Sometimes it's a thumb brake.  Sometimes it is a second lever which a lot of people refer to as a scooter brake.  Both of them essentially do the same thing and have the same intent.  They are an additional control for your rear brake.  The impetus for these things coming into existence was for racers to have control of their rear brake when turning right at high lean angles.  In a right turn, proper body position puts your right foot pointed out with the ball of your foot pressed into the end of the peg.  That puts the foot in a position where accessing the rear brake becomes awkward at best, impossible at worst.  For mere mortals like us, that's fine.  Just skip the use of the rear brake in that scenario.  For guys that have seven figure paychecks on the line, shaving tenths of a second of their lap time matters... A lot.  They and their engineers will do anything they can to give them an edge.  The first guys that started using one showed immediate improvement in lap times and within a few years, you didn't see a single bike on the MotoGP grid without one.  As it is not a terribly expensive or complicated technology, it has trickled down and now you see them with some regularity at your local track.  You can get and install a thumb brake on your bike for less than $800.  If you can afford one, honestly they are pretty nice.

There are two ways to set up a thumb brake.  Thumb brakes have a built in master cylinder just like your front brake.  So technically, you can run a line directly to the rear caliper.  If you do this, you would remove the foot brake lever as it is no longer connected to the system.  Alternatively, you can replace the original rear master cylinder with one that allows daisy chaining the thumb brake master cylinder to the one by the foot brake.  This allows you to use both controls.  The way a thumb brake master cylinder is constructed, it will apply less pressure to the rear caliper than pressing on the foot brake though.  That fact alone makes a strong argument for setting it up in a way that allows use of both controls.

**Thumb Brake vs. Foot Control**

So...  We've already established that the thumb brake and foot brake apply different amounts of pressure.  They share a closed hydraulic system though so you can really only get full pressure with one of them at a time.  If you have the thumb brake depressed and you step on the foot brake, the strength of the foot brake will push the thumb brake back out.  There's only so much room for fluid in the line after all.

I would propose the following uses for the two brakes.  The foot brake is for stopping and the thumb brake is for turning.  

If you are stopping the bike, you want strong brakes.  You are likely in a straight line, or at a minimum trying to stand the bike up, so there's no space constraints limiting your access to the foot brake.  Both of those facts should say: use the foot brake.

If you are initiating a turn on the other hand, even though the thumb brake was designed to solve the leaning right problem, I would suggest using the thumb brake for all turns.  The goal of the rear brake in a turn is to apply the brake pads to the rotors enough to add some stability as you tip in, or smoothly tighten your line mid turn.  Both of those goals require finesse, not a blunt application of the brakes.  Hence, the thumb brake being the superior control.

**Totally non-essential thumb brake bonus**

When you are stopped in traffic, you can put whichever foot you want down as you can cover the rear brake with your thumb instead of your foot.  Sweet...  They are also awesome for being stopped on a hill.  You can hold your clutch and rear brake in with one hand.

# Conclusion

So we've discussed what the brakes do to your suspension; what they do to your tires, what they do to your geometry.  We've discussed the preferred use of the front and rear brakes.  How to use them to effectively emergency stop, butler stop, and trail brake.  And as a bonus, we discussed the uses of a fancy thumb brake vs a traditional foot only rear brake.  All of this was to kind of give you the ""why"" of how you use the brakes.  If someone just tells you to do something in a particular way, I find that without the ""why"" I never really trust what they tell me.  Once you understand the ""why"" it is easy to make your own decisions and have a more focused practice as you strive to improve.",1,1748740025.0,MotorcycleMentor,0,1.0,False

1l0claa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1l0claa/guys_i_think_im_living_a_romantic_comedy/,Guys‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm living a romantic comedy,"Some weeks ago, I visited a small optical store where a girl I had grown quietly fond of worked. We had shared just brief interactions ‚Äî polite, cheerful, even a little flirty ‚Äî but I felt something spark every time I saw her. She had this mix of warmth, intelligence and shyness that stayed with me.

Eventually, I picked up my last pair of lenses‚Ä¶ and stopped going. I figured it was all in my head.

Still, I kept watching the store‚Äôs Instagram stories ‚Äî mostly just to feel a small connection. I didn‚Äôt really pay attention to the songs they used or the reflections. I just kept showing up silently.

Then they stopped posting for two days. When they finally returned, I messaged them something lighthearted:
""You guys had me worried! I‚Äôve been holding my breath for a couple of days üòÇ Didn‚Äôt even know what day it was!""

That‚Äôs when it all changed.

The very next story was unlike any other. It showed sunglasses on display ‚Äî and for the first time ever, her reflection was clearly visible in the lenses. Until then, she had always avoided showing herself, even subtly. The caption, the timing, the lyrics of the song‚Ä¶ it all felt deliberate.

From that point on, I started paying attention ‚Äî and noticed a whole romantic language unfolding through stories and lyrics. The song choices started matching emotional shifts: longing, tension, humor, even a reference to ""the sun always shines"" right after I posted a very personal song. And now I realize that through those songs, we were actually talking.

But I still wasn‚Äôt sure: Was it really her behind those stories? Or just a coincidence?

So I ran an experiment.

I posted a story on a Saturday, knowing that during weekends, her colleague (the owner) is the only one with access to Instagram. Unlike her, he‚Äôs never shown any interest in me. The store account follows over a thousand people, and finding me in their story feed would require intention.

Hours passed. The store‚Äôs account connected twice ‚Äî but didn‚Äôt watch my story.
Then Monday morning came‚Ä¶ and boom, it was viewed ‚Äî exactly at the time she would‚Äôve picked up the work phone.

That‚Äôs when I knew: it‚Äôs her. It‚Äôs always been her.

Now I‚Äôm going back to pick up some lenses ‚Äî and I‚Äôve decided to respond in the same language she‚Äôs been using all this time.

I‚Äôll keep it casual. Then at some point I‚Äôll say:
""Hey‚Ä¶ you guys have had great taste in Instagram stories lately.""

If I see her smile ‚Äî if her eyes light up even a little ‚Äî I‚Äôll take out my phone and play a song. One that I‚Äôve chosen carefully. One that says what I‚Äôve been too shy to say: I‚Äôd love to take you out for a coffee.

She created a language of reflections, lyrics and subtle signs.
I want to answer in a way that honors how magical this has already been.

1l0cbam,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ratina_filia/comments/1l0cbam/we_have_an_ally_problem/,We Have An Ally Problem,"I've discussed this so many times, in a wide variety of places, online and off, and this is a great time for a topic that is very dear to my heart:

# We have an ally problem

When I transitioned there were fewer than 10,000 post-operative transsexuals of both sexes in the US. As of just a few years ago, a former activist found data which showed that there were fewer than 50,000 fully transitioned - legal name and gender marker - transsexuals in the US.

The first figure came from calculations involving major SRS surgeons in the US and Canada and the percentage of patients leaving the US, or coming to the US, to have SRS. Included in that were the number of surgeries which were either revisions (re-doing a procedure) or ""upgrades"" (doing a second or third producer on a person who'd already had an SRS-related procedure).

If you look at surveys, all of which are done by ""allies"", because ""enemies"" use those surveys as well, there are supposedly about 3 million ""trans people"" in the US. That's really simple math, and it comes out to about a 100x difference.

I've mentioned that we need a 95 to 99 percent reduction in ""transitions"", the bulk of that is in that 100x difference. It's not the 50,000 fully transitioned, including legal paperwork changed, people pushing the narrative that the other 2,950,000 ""trans people"" are valid. You can go to subs like¬†[r/Transmedical](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transmedical/)¬†and you'll find no support for the belief everything is valid, and you can go to places like¬†[r/MtF](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/)¬†and¬†[r/ftm](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/), and there's no support for ""the only valid trans people are the ones who fully transition and try to fully assimilate"".

What it means is the 2,950,000 people aren't supported by the 50,000 people, they are primarily supported by the 75,000,000 or so people who voted for Kamala Harris. That's about a 1000x difference.

I was a member of a large LGBT group with somewhere around 5,000 members in it. I was the only post-SRS fully transitioned person in that group. There were 1 or 2, depending on when I'm talking about, not-yet-fully-transitioned trans people in that group. My positions were in the minority. There's a repeat of that 1000x difference.

What I would ask anyone -¬†*G*ender Critical or Transsexual¬†- who is trying to solve these problems to do is ask if the people pushing whatever contentious issue is being discussed, are the problematic people fully transitioned trans people, or are they something else. And if they are ""something else"", or are they cisgender allies.

When I was in middle and high school I didn't need ""pronouns"". What I needed was protection from bullying. I didn't need my ""gender identity affirmed"". I think having my ""gender identity affirmed"" in school would have ratcheted up the abuse to the point I'd probably have left high school at 16. I had a drinking problem at 16 (I had a drinking problem at 15 as well) and I doubt I'd have made it to college.

I did not need to run track, or play baseball or soccer, against girls. I didn't need ""pronouns"". I didn't need to have long hair or wear dresses. I needed protection from bullying, and given my particular circumstances, I needed all the advancements in medical science over the last 50 years.

Our ""allies"" are the ones pushing ""pronouns"" and social transition at 12, and ""expressing our true selves"".

The 50,000 of us, in the US, who are working jobs and mowing our lawns are hugely outnumbered and intellectually dishonest *Gender Critical* people act like we're the ones pushing what is being done by the rest of the 2,950,000 or 75,000,000 people.

I just finished my first cup of coffee. I've taken my daily hormones and vitamins and mineral supplements. I'm sitting in my kitchen in just my undies, and I'm going to go into the laundry room and start a load of whites, then knits, and try to wrap up leftover job work from this week. I got my tax refund 3 weeks ago, I paid some property taxes recently, I'm clearing weeds out of my garden beds. I'm not off doing weird things that Gender Critical should find offensive, and I'm not doing things that Radical Transgender Activists think I need to be doing for them. Once the laundry is started, I need to clean out and change a bunch of cat litter. When the sun has been out long enough to dry out my yard, I'll go mow my yard. I won't be screaming ""It's MA'AM!"" at the people in the garden shop I'm going to visit.

That is the life of the 50,000 of us who are suffering the consequences of anywhere from 3-75,000,000 people saying we need to be different.",1,1748739028.0,u_ratina_filia,0,1.0,False
1l0cb58,https://www.reddit.com/r/HingeStories/comments/1l0cb58/from_hey_to_lets_live_together_and_have_sex_every/,From ‚ÄúHey‚Äù to ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs live together and have sex every day‚Äù in 48 hours.,"I‚Äôm 27F and recently matched with a 32M on Hinge. Let‚Äôs call him K.

At first, he messaged me in this oddly formal tone. Not cold exactly, but definitely not the casual, back-and-forth vibe most people have on dating apps. I figured maybe he was just reserved or polite until he got to know someone. Nothing felt wrong, so when he asked for my number, I gave it.

Once we moved to WhatsApp, it felt like I had accidentally walked into a business negotiation. He suddenly had this ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a high-stakes meeting‚Äù kind of energy. It wasn‚Äôt a conversation anymore. It felt like a pitch. And then the messages started:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt multitask in love so talk to only one girl at a time. Right now it‚Äôs you. N I want your time efforts energy focus mindspace. Everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúCall at your convenience.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you formal? You didn‚Äôt save my number. 48 hours is long time üòÜ but follow the procedure whatever works for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI work in high stakes negotiations and can‚Äôt vouch for this being absolutely incorrect.‚Äù

That was his response when I said our communication styles didn‚Äôt align and that if we pushed this, it might just end badly.

Then he said

‚ÄúN what if it doesn‚Äôt go bad? Would it be appropriate to ask you on a date? Ya it would be a longer path? Should I ask you out? Boy I bet Would that be a fun date ü§£‚Äù

Keep in mind this was still day one.

I told him I‚Äôd be open to getting to know him if he dropped the whole deal-making vibe and just acted like a person. He lives in another city. His response?

‚ÄúYou come here. Let‚Äôs stay together. At least it would be worth spending this much if 2 people stay in it. Let me come down n spend a weekend together. Then if it works out, I can do Tues to Thursday here n weekends with you.‚Äù

We hadn‚Äôt even had a phone call at this point. And this man was planning our living situation.

When we finally did talk on the phone, it escalated fast. He said he‚Äôd take care of me, but wanted everything. My time, effort, energy, vulnerability, attention, and sex. He told me he has a high libido and wants to do it every day. There was no space for comfort or conversation. It felt like a checklist.

The whole thing gave off Christian Grey vibes, but the kind where he skips the contract and tries to fast-track you into being his submissive by day two because he has ‚Äúgenerational wealth.‚Äù

I told him I wasn‚Äôt okay talking about sex so early, especially with someone I didn‚Äôt know yet. He said

‚ÄúSee I‚Äôm an AVP at an investment bank and I have generational wealth. I have way too much money, I‚Äôm looking for someone who wants me.‚Äù

For context, I make 30k INR a month. He pays more than that just in rent.

By day two, it had escalated even more. He was saying he wanted my pictures, that I should kiss him at the end of calls, that he expected sexting and hoped I was already fully comfortable with him.

Trying to steer the conversation to something real, I asked a few normal questions I usually ask people I‚Äôm getting to know.

1. If we ever have a disagreement, how would you handle it
‚ÄúMy work requires negotiation and conflict management. Don‚Äôt worry am not one to throw tantrums. But also, would like you to be matured in being with me. For me intimacy matters. Not just physical. Emotional and mental as well.‚Äù

It didn‚Äôt really answer the question.

2. What are you looking for in a relationship
‚ÄúStable, mature, exciting, exclusive, deep, consistent, passionate, private. If you are with me, I would have it a lot. Am sexually active and don‚Äôt like to keep my hands off my partner.‚Äù

3. What‚Äôs a typical day in your life with a partner
‚ÄúSo we wake up early morning having slept in each other‚Äôs arms. We talk about the day n how it is planned. Get ready, start working. Keep texting and calling each other and discussing developments n challenges. Making sure both feel supported and both are connected without hiding anything. When work gets over, we unwind together without discussing it more and do something together like cooking or going for a walk or something together. We have fun like a small activity such as cycling together or swim together to keep it going. Watch a movie or something to relax. Make passionate love n sleep. Basically being into each other.‚Äù

Later I told him that if he were in the same city, I would have been happy to grab coffee and get to know each other better. He said he doesn‚Äôt do casual meets and that he only meets someone if they are already in a relationship.

This was still day two.

He wanted me to open up now, be vulnerable now, emotionally available now, and be his now.

It was too much. I told him I felt overwhelmed and pressured and that maybe it was best if we ended it here.

He replied

‚ÄúI hope you find someone who makes you happy as well.
I didn‚Äôt want anything instantly. I was hoping you open up to me. But you saying am a bot just doesn‚Äôt show any respect to my efforts. I can be alright with anything but not someone saying such a thing after talking about the pain I went through. Am sure you would not get that now. Someday you will.‚Äù

I apologized if I made him feel disrespected and said it wasn‚Äôt my intention. But he kept going.

‚ÄúAnd it would not come in one conversation. But you making up mind even though we have just spoken once shows how quick you are to move away from this. Things need efforts and I did see if it‚Äôs not your way than it is the highway for you.
You asked me to be patient and I was never in a hurry, we could always clarify that with conversation and giving each other time.‚Äù

For context, I asked him four times if he was willing to give me the space to open up slowly. He didn‚Äôt acknowledge it even once.

‚ÄúAnd in one place you say am pressuring you to move fast and other you say am formal üòÇ how can someone formally ask you to be mine? N am definitely respectful. I am not teenager to talk as bro or dude. I talk a lot with senior people and in general I talk with respect. And in all my life you are the first person to say am not casual in dating chats.‚Äù

‚ÄúI respect your feedback but I definitely don‚Äôt want someone who jumps so quickly to conclusions and not willing to give it time.
You didn‚Äôt feel valued or relaxed, felt uncomfortable multiple times. Good enough to give up. No hard feelings. Let‚Äôs stop here. Gn.‚Äù

So yeah, that‚Äôs how I went from ‚ÄúHey‚Äù to being prepped for a full-time emotional support role, live-in girlfriend, and personal fantasy provider for a self-proclaimed wealthy investment banker in under 48 hours.

If I‚Äôm going to be someone‚Äôs everything, maybe start by asking my favorite movie first.

1l0c5th,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1l0c5th/seeking_advice_on_how_to_move_forward_after/,Seeking advice on how to move forward after breaking up with co-worker,"I dated someone in my grad school cohort on a casual basis for approximately 5 months, before coming to the realization that I cannot manage casual with this individual, as she alternated emotional intensity and aloofness in a way that I found confusing. I also had some reservations as to our compatibility early on, but never firmly acted on them. Approximately four months ago, the alternating intimacy and distance culminated in my inquiring as to whether she saw us moving toward anything more solidified. Her answer was vague and evasive, so I announced a desire to distance myself.

I felt confident in the decision: she was at a place where she wanted to focus on herself and have fun, and I wanted to find commitment in the next couple of years, so our goals were simply incompatible. Plus, she had appeared to take an interest in other people, as she‚Äôd gone on at least one other date that she confirmed and appeared to flirt pretty heavily with others. Disenchanted with the ambiguity over exclusivity, I‚Äôd pursued a few other possibilities myself (albeit reluctantly: she had my heart.) We both seemed fine with it ending. 

However, after inviting me to a coffee in the aftermath of that ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù conversation, she came over to my apartment and we were intimate. The lone difference from pre-‚Äúbreak-up‚Äù intimacy was some awkward conversation in between bouts of activity during which we both claimed to feel ‚Äúconflicted.‚Äù What I recall her asking was whether I might ‚Äúbe patient.‚Äù Because I felt spellbound by her, despite my rational misgivings, I clung to that seeming indication that with a brief break during which she attended to her mental health, we might pursue something legitimate in the years to come.

After that evening together, all signs of affection seemed to evaporate. She ignored me altogether when we saw one another, made passive-aggressive comments toward me in the company of our colleagues, and generally behaved in ways that were strikingly rude, which I found weird, given that we‚Äôd apparently agreed to remain friendly. 

I began to give up on the prospect of friendship after her no-showing a couple of events I‚Äôd invited her to without so much as a text explaining her inability to make it. The last straw was her agreeing to hangout after a work function then bowing out as soon as the event wrapped. She sent what seemed like a rather half-hearted ‚Äúsorry‚Äù text afterwards, but I was tired of trying to keep up some semblance of an amicable connection, so I didn‚Äôt acknowledge it for some time. After a couple of weeks, I figured I was being childish, so I sent a simple ‚Äúno worries,‚Äù to which no reply ever arrived (I didn‚Äôt expect one.) I just knew she had a history of being ghosted by former intimates, and I couldn‚Äôt bear inflicting that upon her, as disappointed as I was in the whole situation.

Days later, I noticed that I‚Äôd been added to a group chat by her, as she was organizing a hangout for our cohort. I was surprised to be included, but was touched by the gesture, and took it as a sign that there were no hard feelings and we could be collegial in the future. Anyway, I woke the next morning to see that she‚Äôd removed me overnight, despite my not interacting with the chat. Given the platform that this was on, everyone would be able to see that I‚Äôd been singled out for removal, so this felt particularly aggressive, and possibly like a bid to ostracize me from a small, tight-knit community essential for my professional development over the next several years. 

I guess what I‚Äôm looking for is some insight into why she‚Äôd do something like this. She was never overly public about the fact that we were seeing one another, so to do something that‚Äôd presumably invite questions as to why she‚Äôd second-guess including someone whom she was frequently seen alongside strikes me as unusual. Also, what, if anything, should I do when everyone is back on campus, in the event that this is what I fear it to be?",2,1748738537.0,emotionalintelligence,4,1.0,False

1l0c50b,https://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/1l0c50b/how_do_i_make_friends/,how do i make friends," recently just graduated college. i used to have a good amount of friends but obviously as the years went by things broke off. went through a lot of girl drama this year with my friend group so i obviously had to take a step back. ex bf and i were on and off but i think its finally over now, but its so lonely because i guess he was my best friend but he didn‚Äôt want to continue, just was a toxic relationship. better in the long run for it to end. i have a few friends they‚Äôre great but they all have boy friends and its completely cool but obviously a majority of their time comes to them which i understand because it‚Äôs their OWN person yk.

i want to make new friends out on my own but idk how to do that at all especially now that i‚Äôm not in school anymore, and in college i wasn‚Äôt really actively continuing to make new friends since i had work, a boyfriend, and my other friends at the time. i have no roster and i don‚Äôt have desire for any of that so distracting myself with men isn‚Äôt really an option. I JUST WANT TO MEET SOME COOL NICE PEOPLE AROUND MY AGE who don‚Äôt really go out clubbing or to the bars bc i don‚Äôt do any of that. i enjoy shopping, self care, eating out, matcha/coffee dates, driving around and always finding ways to better myself. it just seems like everyone has their own life. and i‚Äôm here all alone. i‚Äôm sick and tired of this. idk how to go out alone and find friends so i need help",0,1748738467.0,longisland,3,0.5,False
1l0c48o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1l0c48o/mid_20s_need_advice/,Mid 20s need advice,"To cut a long story short, I started University in the year 2019. However, not too long after in 2020 before COVID hit, I started to feel nauseous 24/7 which even anti sickness medicines can't touch, head pain 24/7, upper abdominal pain 24/7 and also increased my intolerance to foods (sorry to be graphic) with diarrhea the day after. 

Foods that would trigger that include acidic foods, gluten, anything high in fats, chocolate (not sure if that's down to the fat content or something else) and some others. The nausea, upper abdominal pain and head pain remained.

Due to this, I have been stuck at home just being ill with these symptoms. My life was once amazing, good social life, good friends, good University, studying a subject I loved and was just enjoying University life. This in 2020 took a complete 180 and I have since been stuck how I am. This has understandably massively negatively impacted my mental health due to the physical illness itself and I guess social life (or lack of) but tbh it's been such a long time now, I have mostly forgotten what it felt like prior to all this happening. My young adulthood has been robbed from me and I am never going to be able to get it back.

I have seen many, many doctors/specialists and have had more medical tests than 99% of people would ever have in their lifetime. I have had MRIs, CTs, blood tests, Gastric Emptying Study, Colonoscopy, Endoscopy, Capsule Endoscopy just to name a few. The first significant result was inflammation at the terminal ileum as shown on the MRI but that was clear on Colonoscopy biopsies. The second was non-errosive gastritis and duodenitis.

The three separate and independent gastro docotors I have seen said that 1. It is not severe enough to give me the symptoms as I have described above 2. People let's say in ICU have gastritis but they don't get the symptoms as I mentioned above and 3. If it was Gastritis and Duodenitis, I have taken a very, very long course of Omeprazole and Lanzaprazole (at multiple times throughout the past five years) and so it by assumption should have healed it. I would just like to clarify that I do not smoke, drink and have tested negative for H Pylori x2 by Endoscopy.

This then leads me onto why I am here. I am on fomatidine and whilst I am only a week in, the nausea does seem to be a bit better so I am inclined to believe that gastritis/duodenitis are the route causes of my problems. 

1. Why do I still have it and have had it for the past five years? I am not eating anything acidic, drinking coffee etc all the trigger foods and the stomach itself is meant to completely regenerate over the course of a few weeks by itself anyways. 
2. Why didn't the PPI's work, like at all in the previous years and has this happened to anyone else? 
3. Has anyone had diarrhea as a symptom/it has made you more intolerant to specific foods? I have read online that this might be more common with non-errosive Duodenitis rather than Gastritis (I have both)
4. Did fomatidine work for you and what was your dosage and timings?

Feel free to ask if anyone has any questions at all and I will do my best to reply and thank you for reading üôè

7. That the printer only jams when you‚Äôre in a rush, and only prints when you‚Äôve already walked away in defeat.

8. That providers have their own dialects, like ‚Äúwhisper-scribble-mumble‚Äù‚Äîand you're now a certified translator.

9. That asking ‚ÄúIs there anything else I can help with?‚Äù is a trap. A kind, well-meaning, exhausting trap.

10. That the phrase ‚Äúquick question‚Äù from a provider will lead to a full-blown scavenger hunt across three departments and a call to IT.

11. That you will *absolutely* get blamed for that one fax that didn‚Äôt go through‚Äîdespite the machine being from 1997 and powered by hope.

12. That MAs are expected to be experts in vitals, vaccines, vibes, and vending machine diplomacy.

13. That one drawer in every exam room holds a random collection of tongue depressors, paper clips, and forgotten dreams.

14. That ‚Äúteamwork‚Äù sometimes means you inherit someone else‚Äôs half-finished chart and cryptic notes like ‚Äúpt c/o stuff.‚Äù

15. That despite the chaos, the stress, and the coffee running out by 9:02 AM‚Ä¶ you *still* come back the next day‚Äîbecause someone‚Äôs got to hold it all together (and it turns out that someone might just be you).

What are my chances of running into a previous date while on another date? 



-----------
My Hinge profile recently started blowing up for some reason, so I‚Äôve been going on more dates than usual (usual being twice a month). Some don‚Äôt go past the first date, some fizzle out because she never reciprocated my energy and effort, so I clock out. Some end in ghosting, and a few have just been straight up terrible lol

Most of these dates happen inside the loop,  and I tend to stick to the popular places I'm used to - Agora, Echoes, Black Hole Coffee House etc

So now I‚Äôm paranoid:
What are the chances I run into a past date while I‚Äôm on a date with someone else?
Is the dating/social life inside the loop big enough that you'd almost never cross paths with a previous date again? Or is it so small that everyone‚Äôs knows each other and one of your past dates knows your previous roommates and is in the same class with your coworker haha

Also would love to hear from women. If we went on a date that went nowhere OR that had potential but we just fizzled out OR one of us ghosted , AND you saw me out with someone else, how would you want me to act? Quick smile? Nod and acknowledge you? Pretend we‚Äôve never met?

And guys, if this has ever happened to you, what did you do?

I‚Äôm incredibly socially awkward, so I feel like if this ever happened to me I‚Äôd probably just pass out lol. Or maybe I'm over thinking all of this

1l0by46,https://v.redd.it/zq1c6klbn74f1,I tested earbuds today. My recommendations.,"Sony vs. Bose vs. Samsung: The Best Earbuds for Android Users in Every Scenario

I‚Äôve built up a bit of an earbud collection‚ÄîI love testing different ones out depending on where I am or what I‚Äôm doing. Whether it‚Äôs working from a cafe, going for a run, traveling, or just zoning out at home, I‚Äôve realized that no single pair is perfect for every situation. That said, if you‚Äôre looking for a top-tier pair in the $150‚Äì$250 range and you're using Android, I‚Äôd definitely recommend checking out the Sony WF-1000XM5 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II.

The Sony WF-1000XM5 is kind of my go-to for travel or when I want to really immerse myself. I used them on a flight recently, and the noise canceling was so good it actually felt like I was in a quiet room‚Äînot surrounded by a hundred other passengers. The sound is rich and super customizable through the Sony app, and I love how the Adaptive Sound Control adjusts based on where I am‚Äîlike switching from quiet mode at a caf√© to ambient mode when I‚Äôm walking outside. It‚Äôs a smart touch that makes a difference when you're constantly changing environments.

The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II, on the other hand, are my ‚ÄúI need silence now‚Äù earbuds. I pull them out when I‚Äôm trying to focus in a noisy space‚Äîlike a busy coffee shop or even at home when someone‚Äôs watching TV in the next room. The fit is insanely comfortable, and the noise canceling is the best I‚Äôve experienced, hands down. They also sound fantastic, especially with podcasts and acoustic music‚Äîvery clear and natural.

Then there are the Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, which I tend to use for everyday stuff, especially when I‚Äôm pairing them with my phone or tablet. I love how smoothly they switch between devices, and they‚Äôre great for quick calls or workouts. The fit is snug but not too tight, and I don‚Äôt worry about sweat or rain since they‚Äôre water-resistant. If you‚Äôre using a Samsung device, they really shine thanks to the extra features like 360 Audio and high-res support.

Each has its strengths depending on the vibe you're going for.

¬†

Each of these earbuds brings something different to the table, depending on the vibe and what I need in the moment.

He told me how his gaming console growing up would be shipped off while he was in school because his cousins ‚Äú needed it more‚ÄùI took that statement very hard since I HATE when people mess with my stuff due to how I was raised so I‚Äôm very sensitive to these things , I labeled everything with my name / bright neon orange duck tape and I place little cartoon frog stickers on everything even food I buy and condiments. Me and my husband placed the LABELED bag of plushies on top of our dog‚Äôs cage in the laundry room since we didn‚Äôt have space in our room it went along with my coffee table and a couple of other boxes , yesterday I was going to do laundry as my husband went to go play marvel rivals with his friend  right after dinner. As I‚Äôm in the laundry room I think to my self why not take out one of my children and cuddle with them in a folding chair while I wait for laundry to be done so I can put the next load as I‚Äôm watching a Chinese drama. I go look on top  of the cage and I don‚Äôt see the bag I didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with it I thought to myself maybe they placed it along in the corner of the garage where my boxes and other things were at .  I go check don‚Äôt see anything. I then get this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach I slowly start hyperventilating and I can feel my pulse going faster  I start freaking out because I can‚Äôt find the bag. I call my husband while he is in the bathroom and ask him if he‚Äôs seen the bag of plushies or if he moved it . He comes out a little while after  and helps me look he begins to realized and connect the dots. The week prior his grandparents  took a trip to Mexico  to visit family since his grandma was retiring and she was ready to celebrate . They always place stuff they want to take with them on the table behind the cage so they won‚Äôt forget them when they‚Äôre loading up the truck. He goes and asks my mother in law to come to the garage and asks her‚Äù did my grandparents take a big bag with stuffed animals that were on top of this cage‚Äù she gasps so loud and the pit drops my eyes immediately start to water she goes‚Äù was that your wife‚Äôs bag of things‚Äù he goes yeah , she looks at me but I don‚Äôt want her to see me cry so I excuse my self and head over to the bathroom I break down the instant I locked the door and I just start bawling my eyes out sniffling and mucous coming out of my nose the whole deal. My husband later comes into the bathroom and checks in on me and has how I‚Äôm doing first thing I yell out why he brings me into a tight hug into his chest and I just keep on crying and wailing out. Why would they take them? Are they OK? Will they be safe? It was labeled. Why would they take something that is labeled they knew it was mine but they still took it and he says I don‚Äôt know. I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you and I just keep crying and crying out to him sniffling it‚Äôs in between silent cries and outbursts at some point he starts patting my head and he says I understand. I understand you and I look up at him I snuffle and tell him you don‚Äôt understand because if you did, you would be talking to them about it. You don‚Äôt know the type of memories and emotions all of those plushy‚Äôs have for me Later then says what if I take you to the store and replace them all  you know buy you new ones I look at him in this disbelief and say no,no why would you want me to replace my plushy‚Äòs and I just break down I buckle in my knees and I just fall and I‚Äôm just crying. I‚Äôm crying in his legs, he‚Äôs still hugging me And we just stay there for a while until I come off at some point I feel like he got tired of my crying, he picked me up, looked me dead in the eye as he‚Äôs holding onto my shoulders and says stop it think about this rationally And I‚Äôm telling him what I feel like doing that I wanted to bang my head in the wall that I wanted to pull my hair. I wanted to scratch my skin. I just wanted to some other pain than The loss of my stuffed animals he repeats again think about this rationally. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to tell my family to bring back your stuffed animals? Is that what you want me to do I look at him crazy and I‚Äôm like yes of course I want you to tell them to bring back my stuffed animals. Why would I not want them back? He says OK but I want you to stay calm stop crying. and so I just shut off my emotions. I went numb. It‚Äôs something I do when I want to pretend to be happy for other people and immediately my mask went up. I faked smiled. I looked at him. I nodded agreeing to his statement OK I say he says all right. He stepped out. The bathroom goes. Talk to his family and I head to our room and I‚Äôm just laying in bed. I couldn‚Äôt cry anymore. He comes back and then tells me to go outside into the backyard where our dog is while his mom is out there on the phone with her sister and then show me on video Call the stuffed animals and I look at  them. I took one look and I said yeah it‚Äôs them  just devoid of emotion. I just wanted to get it over with. I didn‚Äôt want to keep thinking about it so I excuse myself, I didn‚Äôt wanna be there and they said that they were gonna ship them back and that I was lucky  i made it  in time because they were planning on ripping apart my stuffed animals and using the filling the stuffing to make pillows to sell I‚Äôm not even sure if all of my plushies were there. I‚Äôm not 100% sure if I brought all of my childhood plushy‚Äôs from my childhood home into my new home I‚Äôm scared to know if they‚Äôre damaged or if they‚Äôre not all there or if I don‚Äôt remember all of them and then my husband, he seemed upset at me and was stand-off ish with me and went straight to playing games with his friend. Later on my mother in law comes in and asks me to speak with her in the bathroom . She apologizes and didn‚Äôt realize that she sent my stuffed animals away by accident and that it would hurt me so much. My husbands grandparents asked her why I was crying and she didn‚Äôt tell them anything so everyone has assumed me and my husband are having marital problems. She then said not to tell them I‚Äôm upset about my stuffed animals because then they would be confused as of to why I reacted the way I did about them and that I would be overreacting for ‚Äústuffed animals‚Äù  I‚Äôm still numb but pretending to be okay in front of everyone I‚Äôm just not as playful or talkative with them as I was before so AITAH  for still being upset at my husband and family",1,1748737616.0,AITAH,7,0.67,False

1l0bv5u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l0bv5u,"Graduated - hated wedding planning, had a perfect wedding weekend. Advice and budget","I absolutely HATED wedding planning, but somehow our wedding weekend was actually the most perfect and incredible weekend of my (and my husband's) life. As a super type A person, I was really disappointed in and frustrated by the planning process, but after it was all over, I realized that in the moment, none of the things that had caused all the stress and anxiety had I even thought about. 

This sub was super helpful for my wedding planning and inspo. The number one advice I have is to stand your ground about your preferences. I felt that our planner didn't even try to stick within our budget, and there were a lot of small things that fell through the cracks that I had to continually be reminding (ie personalized napkins with our cat, disposable cameras, adding heaters when the weather ended up being unseasonably cold). Unfortunately, this seems to be an industry standard. I also wish I had been clearer about any kickbacks our planner may have received. Despite the difficulties we felt working with her, she and her team pulled off an absolutely incredible and gorgeous set of events, and once Thursday hit I didn't have a single care in the world about any of the pain points. 

Budget breakdown below includes the three events we hosted: welcome party + wedding/reception + morning after coffee, happy to provide specifics for the individual events. First four photos are welcome party, rest are wedding - DM me!  

* Date: May, 2025
* Santa Barbara, CA 
   * Room block was at Mar Monte - would absolutely not recommend them for a room block! They were very difficult to communicate with and very unaccommodating for guests. They ended up charging us thousands extra randomly for things that weren't related to our stay (ie extra rooms and reservations that were not ours).
   * \~6 weeks  prior to the wedding, we visited for tastings and a venue walkthrough, and we couldn't even find someone at the who was aware that our room block existed. 
* Guest count: 95
   * We ended up with 10 people (one family) canceling the week of due to food poisoning at an event they went to the prior weekend...it happens, we just had to grit your teeth since all the deposits were paid at that point 
* Vibes were organic, California, sunset
* Venue, service, taxes: 16k for wedding
* Food & beverages: 29k
   * We had open bar at welcome party and wedding/reception
* Rentals: 24k
   * This is the most unexpected line item on the budget. Our venue required a full kitchen build out which was not disclosed to/made clear to us prior to signing the contract. We chose pretty barebones rentals (tableware, etc) as a result
* Florals: 10k
   * I really didn't care about flowers, so I gave the florist and planner some preferred colors and let them do their thing together. This was the biggest compliment I heard all weekend, guests were blown away by the florals in a way I didn't know was possible.
* Planner: 12k
* Officiant: 0 (family members)
* Photographer: 10k
   * We impulsively added welcome party photo coverage and I'm so glad we did. Our photographers were the cutest couple who just got married themselves. They were so sweet and absolutely incredible people, did an amazing job. I would recommend them to anyone in California. 
* Videographer: 2k
   * We impulsively added video 1 month before our wedding and I'm so glad we did. The day flew by so fast and I'm so happy to have the memory to rewatch. 
* DJ: 15k
* Hair and makeup: 6k
   * I paid for all bridesmaids, MOB, MOG for both events

   * We used her designs for custom napkins and cocktail stirrers
* Ceremony dress: 4k

   * I wore my mom's dress, paid \~1000 to completely alter it

   * His groomsmen used The Black Tux because they have showrooms in Nordstrom to get measured. The guys had no complaints and everyone showed up day of with a suit that fit
* Wedding rings: 2k
   * Would recommend our jeweler to anyone. They designed my engagement ring and wedding bands, and specialize in redesigning vintage diamond pieces.

I went my entire school career with undiagnosed OCD and Anxiety. I also have a slight physical disability in my right arm that didn't make things easy either. Now, that that's out of the way...

Going into college, (I didn't know it at the time) I stupidly majored in Communications and Journalism. I did everything I was supposed to do. I did clubs, extracurriculars etc. I ended up graduating Summa Cum Laude. I even got a job after graduating, in my field too!

Things took a turn when that dream job became a nightmare. I made less there than at the retail job I‚Äôd left. I was overworked, handling the duties of an entire media team while my efforts were constantly scrutinized. I stretched myself to the point of insomnia, stress nosebleeds, and burnout, but somehow, I wasn‚Äôt a team player because I couldn‚Äôt stretch myself out just *that* much further. 

I eventually left for a more relaxed customer service job, which led to a marketing internship. However, I was frequently pulled away from the internship to cover staffing gaps and help a manager that didn‚Äôt know mouse shit from coffee grinds. The promise of a full-time position was dangled over my head, so I figured I‚Äôd just embrace the suck for a while. When said full-time position finally came up, I was never notified about it. By the time I applied, it was given to someone else. I took that to mean they had someone else in mind from the get-go. If I did something wrong or was just shit at my job, I wish they would‚Äôve just told me. 

I was expected to just crawl back to the department that overworked me like a good little invertebrate. I put in my two weeks‚Äô notice (with nothing else lined up), so both positions ended at the same time.

Since then, I‚Äôve been working low-paying jobs. I ended up taking a job in a mailroom. It was the only job that said yes to me after months of ""No's"" and I needed the money.

¬†I spent a year doing an accredited Paralegal certification while working. It honestly hasn‚Äôt been worth the time or effort. I called various law firms inquiring about positions, even ones for secretaries, and I was turned down. The one that did have an open position, told me they were looking for someone that was bilingual, on top of having the cert. I almost threw my phone against the wall after the call ended.

So now I‚Äôm stuck and all the options seem to lead to more dead ends. I wish I could go back to school, but taking on all that debt after graduating virtually debt-free scares me. 
I could quit my crappy mailroom, but I'd just end up back in retail or customer service again. 
I wish I could join the military, but if my arm doesn't keep me out the anti-depressant surely will. I've officially hit the goddamn wall. ",1,1748737540.0,Vent,1,0.67,False

1l0bsil,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReclaimTheShame/comments/1l0bsil/turning_bad_day_into_good/,Turning bad day into good,"Today started off as a really rough day. Feeling the loss of another friend as I see ignorance grow thicker than love where we may need to part ways. To top off a rainy rough start to the day, the stem in my bong broke inside. I decided to trek in the rain to a convenience store....who tried to sell me a straight pipe and missed the part where I spoke of my bong. Which was also a little frusterating to encounter, but not the point. 
I crossed the street to catch the bus and began talking to a new to me human at the stop, who happened to be also having a bad day. Since I was on my way to get coffee before going to visit someone at the hospital, I invited them to join me, and had a lot of amazing conversations and experience share with them. As I parted ways, they told me I saved their life, and explained to me what was happening on their end before I had come up to them. 

Such a simple gesture, and a little care to want to brighten their day ended up turning both our bad days into better ones, and was a true reminder that everything happens for a reason, and to always follow my heart and my gut, especially on the rough days when it can be a little hard to see what is to come of turbulent times. 

Lead with kindness and care and universe will steer you where it is you need to go. Just don't forget to pause and listen too, to understand and to share in one another's human experience. ",1,1748737378.0,ReclaimTheShame,0,1.0,False

1l0bndu,https://youtu.be/OtUvDBvdcuo,3 Very Scary TRUE Hiking Trail Vanishing Horror Stories,"# ""The Orange Trail"":

I‚Äôd been planning this trip to Great Smoky Mountains National Park for months, dreaming of the green ridges and waterfalls. When my friends canceled‚Äîone sick, another stuck at work‚ÄîI almost gave up. But I‚Äôd driven six hours, packed my gear, and taken time off. Going solo wasn‚Äôt ideal, but the Abrams Falls trail was popular, a five-mile loop. I figured I‚Äôd be fine.At the Cades Cove trailhead, I checked my backpack: two water bottles, granola bars, a sandwich, a first-aid kit, a map, a compass, and a pocketknife. My phone was charged, though I knew signal could be spotty. A ranger approached as I locked my car, his green uniform neat, clipboard in hand. He had a weathered face and a slow drawl.‚ÄúPermit?‚Äù he asked.I handed it over. ‚ÄúGot it right here.‚ÄùHe scanned it, eyeing my pack. ‚ÄúWhere you headed?‚Äù‚ÄúAbrams Falls loop. Back by evening.‚Äù‚ÄúSmart to stick to the main trail,‚Äù he said, handing back the permit. ‚ÄúGets busy, but people still get turned around. Phone good?‚Äù‚ÄúFull battery,‚Äù I said, patting my pocket.‚ÄúSignal‚Äôs patchy out there. Stay on the path, and mark your turns if you‚Äôre unsure.‚Äù He pointed to a small stack of orange trail markers on a table. ‚ÄúGrab a few of those. Drop ‚Äòem if you need to backtrack.‚Äù‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said, pocketing a handful of the plastic markers. His advice stuck with me as I started down the trail.The path was wide, dirt packed under my boots, ferns brushing my legs. The air smelled of pine and earth, and birds sang overhead. About a mile in, I passed a couple taking selfies by a trail sign. The woman, with a bright ponytail, grinned at me.‚ÄúGreat day for a hike, right?‚Äù she said.‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt be better,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúYou guys going to the falls?‚Äù‚ÄúYep!‚Äù the man said, adjusting his cap. ‚ÄúBet we‚Äôll beat you there.‚ÄùI laughed. ‚ÄúChallenge accepted.‚Äù We waved, and I kept walking, their laughter fading behind me.The trail curved, following the faint sound of a creek. I snapped photos of purple wildflowers and a deer that darted across the path. My phone buzzed‚Äîa text from my sister checking in‚Äîbut when I tried to reply, the signal was gone. I shrugged it off. I‚Äôd be back soon.At Abrams Falls, the trail opened to a 20-foot waterfall crashing into a rocky pool. The roar drowned out the forest‚Äôs hum. I expected to see the couple or other hikers, but it was just me. I sat on a boulder, ate my sandwich, and sipped water. My map showed the return loop was longer, winding through denser woods, but marked. I dropped one of the ranger‚Äôs orange markers at the trail junction, just in case, and started back.The return path narrowed, roots twisting underfoot, trees closing in. The light dimmed, the canopy thick. I checked my compass, making sure I was heading west, and kept an eye on the trail markers‚Äîwooden posts with arrows. But they grew sparse, and the path felt less defined. My phone had no signal, battery at 80%. I stopped, unfolding my map, but the lines seemed off, the landmarks unclear. A knot formed in my stomach. This was a popular trail. How could it feel so wrong?‚ÄúHey! Anyone out there?‚Äù I called. My voice echoed, unanswered. I dropped another orange marker and turned back, hoping to retrace to the falls. But the path looked different, overgrown with brambles. Panic crept in. ‚ÄúStay calm,‚Äù I muttered, gripping my compass. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got this.‚ÄùThe forest grew denser, the air heavy with damp earth. I moved slower, checking my map and compass often, dropping markers every few hundred yards. My boots crunched on pine needles, the only sound besides my breathing. Then I saw it‚Äîa gray sneaker, muddy and alone, lying in the dirt. It was new, laces tied, like someone had just stepped out of it.I picked it up, heart racing. ‚ÄúWho leaves a shoe out here?‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúHello? Anyone lose this?‚Äù Silence. I set it down, my hands shaky, and dropped another marker. The forest felt watchful, every rustle making me jump. My phone was at 60%, still no signal. The map was useless now; I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint my location.I heard a crunch behind me, like footsteps on leaves. I froze, listening. Nothing. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I called, my voice trembling. No answer. I walked faster, glancing back, my pulse pounding. Another crunch, closer. I spun around, but the trees were empty. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt funny!‚Äù I shouted, clutching my pocketknife.The trail was barely a path now, just a faint line through the underbrush. I dropped another marker, my hands sweating. Then I saw something carved into a tree‚Äîinitials, ‚ÄúJ.K. ‚Äô22,‚Äù jagged and deep. My stomach dropped. Was this a hiker‚Äôs mark, or something worse? I thought of the sneaker, abandoned. Had someone else been lost here?The footsteps came again, quick and deliberate. I ran, branches scraping my arms, my backpack bouncing. My ankle twisted on a root, pain flaring, but I kept going, limping into a small clearing. In the center was a cairn, rocks stacked too neatly, like someone had built it recently. My skin crawled. I approached, spotting a scrap of red fabric under the rocks, stained dark‚Äîmud or blood, I couldn‚Äôt tell. I dropped it, my breath hitching. ‚ÄúWhat is this place?‚Äù I whispered.The footsteps stopped, replaced by heavy breathing, close, just beyond the trees. I gripped my knife, heart hammering. ‚ÄúStay back!‚Äù I yelled, scanning the shadows. Nothing. The air felt thick, oppressive. I checked my compass‚Äîstill west‚Äîand dropped another marker. I had to move.I limped forward, the pain in my ankle sharp. The forest seemed endless, every tree identical. My phone was at 30%, dead for calls. I tripped, falling into a ditch, my hands sinking into cold dirt. Something glinted in the leaves‚Äîa rusted watch, its face cracked, stopped at 3:17. I grabbed it, then dropped it, my mind racing. Another lost hiker? I didn‚Äôt want to know.The breathing came again, closer, from my left. I scrambled up, knife out, backing away. ‚ÄúLeave me alone!‚Äù I shouted. Then I saw him‚Äîa man, tall and thin, standing at the clearing‚Äôs edge. His clothes were tattered, his face shadowed under a frayed hat. His eyes gleamed, cold and unblinking. He didn‚Äôt move, just stared.‚ÄúHelp me,‚Äù I croaked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lost. Please.‚ÄùHe tilted his head, then raised a hand, pointing deeper into the forest, away from my markers. My blood ran cold. Was he helping, or leading me astray? ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I asked, my voice shaking. He turned, melting into the trees, silent. I stood frozen, unsure if he was real or a trick of my fear.I didn‚Äôt follow him. Instead, I turned back, following my orange markers, each one a lifeline. My ankle throbbed, my water was low, but I kept moving, checking my compass obsessively. The forest was dark now, the light fading. I found a stream, its water cold and clear, and drank, praying it was safe. By the bank, I saw a torn notebook page, waterlogged, with scrawled words: ‚ÄúLost. Day 3. No one‚Äôs coming.‚Äù My heart sank. Someone else had been here, desperate like me.I kept going, following the stream, my markers guiding me back. My legs shook, my vision blurred from exhaustion. Then I heard it‚Äîa distant shout, human voices. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I yelled, my voice hoarse. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here!‚ÄùThe voices grew louder, and I saw flashlights bobbing through the trees. Relief flooded me. I dropped to my knees, shouting again. ‚ÄúOver here!‚ÄùA search team found me‚Äîrangers and volunteers, their faces grim but kind. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky,‚Äù one said, wrapping a blanket around me. ‚ÄúWe followed your markers. Most don‚Äôt leave a trail like that.‚Äù They gave me water, bandaged my ankle, and led me out. My phone was dead, my pack lighter without the markers, but I was alive.Later, at the ranger station, they told me about the sneaker, the cairn, the watch, the note. They‚Äôd found similar things before, relics of hikers who‚Äôd vanished, like Dennis Martin in ‚Äô69, a boy lost near Spence Field, never found. They didn‚Äôt know who the man was‚Äîmaybe a drifter, maybe my imagination. But my markers, the ranger‚Äôs advice, had saved me. I left the Smokies shaken, vowing never to hike alone again, the forest‚Äôs secrets still whispering in my mind.

  


# ""No Signal"":

My boots sank into the soft earth of the trail, each step a dull thud against the packed dirt and scattered pebbles. The forest loomed around us, dense with towering pines and tangled underbrush that seemed to claw at my legs. My backpack felt heavier with every mile, the straps rubbing my shoulders raw. Lisa and Chris were ahead, their voices drifting back in snippets, sharp against the quiet hum of the woods. We‚Äôd chosen this remote state park because it promised a real escape‚Äîno crowds, no noise, just us and the wild. I‚Äôd found it online after weeks of scrolling through hiking forums, drawn to reviews that called it ‚Äúuntouched‚Äù and ‚Äúisolated.‚Äù Now, hours into our trek, that isolation felt like a weight of its own.‚ÄúHow much farther to the campsite?‚Äù Lisa asked, pausing to adjust her cap. Her ponytail swung as she turned, her face flushed from the climb.Chris, always the navigator, checked his phone. The screen glowed faintly, no bars showing. ‚ÄúMap says about a half-mile,‚Äù he said, squinting at the downloaded trail guide. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre close to the clearing.‚ÄùWe pushed on, the trail narrowing until it was barely a path, branches brushing our arms. The forest smelled of damp earth and pine, but there was something else too‚Äîa faint, sour tang that made me wrinkle my nose. Finally, we reached the clearing, a small patch of flat ground surrounded by trees that seemed to lean inward. We dropped our packs and started setting up camp, the familiar routine of pitching tents and unrolling sleeping bags grounding me. But as I drove a tent stake into the ground, my eyes caught something through the trees‚Äîa second campsite, maybe 50 yards away, half-hidden by a cluster of pines.‚ÄúGuys, look,‚Äù I said, pointing. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another campsite over there. But‚Ä¶ no one‚Äôs around.‚ÄùChris followed my gaze, his brow furrowing. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird. Their tents are up. Maybe they‚Äôre out exploring?‚ÄùLisa stepped closer, shielding her eyes. ‚ÄúTheir stuff‚Äôs just sitting there. Doesn‚Äôt look right. Should we check it out?‚ÄùI hesitated, a prickle of unease creeping up my spine. But curiosity won out. ‚ÄúYeah, let‚Äôs take a look.‚ÄùWe crossed the clearing, the ground uneven underfoot. As we neared the other campsite, that sour smell grew stronger, sharp and unpleasant, like rotting food mixed with something acrid‚Äîurine, maybe. The site was a mess: two tents, one with a torn flap hanging loose, flapping softly. A cooler sat open, its lid askew, and nearby, a couple of camping chairs lay tipped over, one with a broken armrest. A fire pit held charred logs, surrounded by a pile of trash‚Äîempty cans, plastic wrappers, and a half-eaten apple swarming with ants.‚ÄúThis place stinks,‚Äù I said, covering my nose with my sleeve.Lisa, braver than either of us, stepped toward the larger tent. She crouched, peered inside, and jerked back, her hand flying to her mouth. ‚ÄúOh my god, it‚Äôs awful in there. Smells like urine‚Ä¶ and something worse.‚Äù She pointed, her voice shaky. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a sleeping bag with dark stains on it. Looks like blood.‚ÄùMy heart lurched. ‚ÄúBlood?‚Äù I stepped closer, peering into the tent. The sleeping bag was crumpled, the stains dark and splotchy, spreading across the fabric like spilled ink. The air inside was thick, the smell so bad I gagged.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs check the other tent,‚Äù Chris said, his voice tight. He was already moving toward the smaller one, a faded green dome half-zipped shut.Inside, it was less chaotic but no less unsettling. A duffel bag sat in the corner, stuffed with clothes‚Äîa flannel shirt, a pair of jeans, socks spilling out. A toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste lay on the ground, as if dropped in a hurry. Then Chris knelt and pulled something from under a sleeping pad: a small leather journal, its cover worn but intact.‚ÄúFound something,‚Äù he said, holding it up.We took it back to our campsite, the weight of what we‚Äôd seen settling over us. Sitting cross-legged on the ground, Chris opened the journal, its pages crinkling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs,‚Äù he said, scanning the first page. ‚ÄúShe was here with her partner.‚Äù He started reading aloud, his voice steady but low.‚ÄúDay one: Got to the park late. Set up camp by the stream. The forest is so quiet, it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre the only ones here. Excited for the hike tomorrow.‚Äù‚ÄúDay two: Hiked to the ridge today. The view was incredible, but we got into it over the map. He‚Äôs so stubborn, always thinks he knows best. Brushed it off, but it stung.‚ÄùThe entries grew tense. ‚ÄúDay three: Things are off. He‚Äôs moody, snapping at me over nothing. I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells. The forest feels too big, too empty.‚Äù‚ÄúDay four: Met some other hikers today, a group of guys. They were nice, offered us some food and a drink. He got jealous, accused me of being too friendly. We fought again. I‚Äôm starting to feel trapped.‚ÄùLisa shifted, hugging her knees. ‚ÄúThis is creepy. It‚Äôs like things were falling apart.‚ÄùChris nodded and kept reading. ‚ÄúDay five: I can‚Äôt take this anymore. He‚Äôs controlling, yelling over stupid things. I want to leave, but we‚Äôre miles from the trailhead, no signal. I‚Äôm scared to say anything. The woods feel different now, like they‚Äôre watching.‚ÄùThe final entry, dated yesterday, made my skin crawl. ‚ÄúDay six: We had a huge fight last night. He screamed, said I‚Äôd regret crossing him. This morning, he was gone. His pack, his clothes‚Äîeverything‚Äôs still here. I hear noises at night, like animals moving, or maybe something else. I found names in his phone: Jake, Mark, Steve. Don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre friends or what. I‚Äôm too scared to leave the campsite. I don‚Äôt know what to do.‚ÄùChris closed the journal. The air felt heavy, the forest too still. ‚ÄúShe was alone when she wrote that,‚Äù I said, my voice barely above a whisper.Lisa‚Äôs eyes were wide. ‚ÄúWhere did she go? And where‚Äôs her partner?‚Äù‚ÄúMaybe she got lost,‚Äù Chris said, but he didn‚Äôt sound convinced. ‚ÄúOr‚Ä¶ something happened to them.‚ÄùI swallowed hard. ‚ÄúWe should look around. See if there‚Äôs anything else.‚ÄùWe spread out, searching the area around the campsite. I found footprints near the edge of the clearing, pressed into the soft dirt, heading into the woods. They were small, maybe a woman‚Äôs, but they stopped abruptly after a few yards, swallowed by a patch of pine needles. Chris checked the stream nearby but found nothing‚Äîno tracks, no signs. Lisa stayed near the tents, poking through the trash. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a broken watch here,‚Äù she called, holding up a cracked wristwatch, its hands frozen at 3:17.‚ÄúAM or PM?‚Äù I asked.She shrugged. ‚ÄúNo way to tell.‚ÄùAs the light faded, a low growl rumbled through the trees, deep and guttural. My heart jumped. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I whispered.Chris froze. ‚ÄúBear, maybe. Or a mountain lion. We need to get back to our site.‚ÄùWe hurried to our tents, the growl echoing in my ears. That night, we barely slept. Every snap of a twig, every rustle of leaves made my pulse race. Around midnight, Lisa‚Äôs voice came through the tent wall, shaky. ‚ÄúYou guys hear that? It‚Äôs closer now.‚ÄùI listened, my breath shallow. Another growl, low and menacing, not far off. ‚ÄúStay in your tent,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move.‚ÄùMorning light brought no comfort. We crawled out to find our cooler scratched with deep claw marks, the plastic gouged like it had been clawed by something big. Our trash bag was torn open, food scraps scattered across the clearing. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù Chris said, his face pale. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre reporting this and getting out.‚ÄùWe packed up, moving fast, the journal tucked into my bag. The hike to the ranger station felt endless, every shadow making me flinch. When we got there, the ranger, an older man with deep lines on his face, listened as we spilled the story. I handed him the journal. ‚ÄúWe found this abandoned campsite,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTents, gear, blood on a sleeping bag. And this journal. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ disturbing.‚ÄùHe flipped through it, his expression unreadable. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had reports of missing hikers in this park before,‚Äù he said, his voice flat. ‚ÄúCouple went missing last year, never found. I‚Äôll send a team to check the site. Thanks for letting us know.‚ÄùWe left the park that day, piling into the car in silence. The drive home was heavy, none of us wanting to talk about what we‚Äôd seen. I kept picturing the torn tent, the stained sleeping bag, the journal‚Äôs last words. Later, I searched online for news about the park. There was a brief article about a missing couple, last seen near our trail, but no updates, no answers. The ranger‚Äôs words stuck with me‚Äîmissing hikers, never found.I haven‚Äôt gone hiking since. Every time I think about it, I see those footprints vanishing into the trees, hear that growl in the dark. I wonder about the woman, alone, scared, writing in that journal. Did she try to leave and get lost? Did an animal get her? Or were those names‚ÄîJake, Mark, Steve‚Äîmore than just names in a phone? The forest knows, but it‚Äôs not telling.

  


# ""The Valley That Watches"":

I‚Äôve been hiking for years, always drawn to the quiet of the wild. There‚Äôs something about leaving the city behind‚ÄîMelbourne‚Äôs constant hum of traffic and screens‚Äîthat makes me feel alive. This time, I picked Wonnangatta Valley, a remote stretch in the Australian Alps, where the air feels thick with silence and the trees stand like sentinels. I‚Äôd read about people vanishing out here, like Russell Hill and Carol Clay, a couple who went missing a few years back. Their story lingered in my mind‚Äîan eerie footnote about their burnt-out campsite and no trace of them since. But I wasn‚Äôt worried. I‚Äôm careful, always prepared with my topographic map, compass, multi-tool, and enough food and water for a week. My pack was heavy, but I liked it that way. It felt like control.The first day was perfect. I trekked deep into the valley, following a winding trail along a creek that bubbled over smooth stones. I set up my tent on a flat patch of earth, the ground soft with pine needles. The valley was alive with small sounds‚Äîbirds chirping, leaves rustling, the faint gurgle of water. I cooked a simple meal on my portable stove, the smell of instant noodles mixing with the earthy scent of the forest. That night, I fell asleep to the hum of insects, my sleeping bag snug, my flashlight close. I felt safe, like the valley was mine.Day two started easy. I packed up, checked my map, and headed north toward a ridge I‚Äôd marked for its view. The trail was narrow, overgrown in places, with roots snaking across the dirt. My boots crunched steadily, and I kept a rhythm, my walking stick tapping the ground. Around midday, I stopped to refill my water bottle at a stream, the water cold enough to make my fingers ache. That‚Äôs when I noticed something off the trail, half-hidden by thick ferns‚Äîa campsite.It wasn‚Äôt mine. The tent was still standing, a faded blue dome with its flaps unzipped, swaying slightly. A fire pit sat in the center, piled with ashes that looked fresh, like someone had been here recently. A metal coffee pot lay tipped over beside it, a few grounds scattered in the dirt. My pulse quickened. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called, my voice sharp against the quiet. ‚ÄúAnyone here?‚Äù Nothing answered, just the echo of my words fading into the trees. The silence felt heavier now, like it was pressing down on me.I stepped closer, my boots sinking into the soft earth. The campsite looked too neat, like it had been abandoned in a hurry. A backpack leaned against a tree, its straps tangled. A pair of hiking boots sat outside the tent, laces undone, soles caked with mud. I crouched by the fire pit and touched the ashes‚Äîthey were warm, maybe a day old. My stomach twisted. People don‚Äôt just leave a campsite like this, not with gear still here.Inside the tent, I found a sleeping bag, unrolled but empty, and a small journal tucked into a side pocket. The cover was worn, with ‚ÄúRussell Hill‚Äù scrawled in black ink. My breath caught. I knew that name‚ÄîRussell Hill and Carol Clay, the hikers who vanished. Their campsite was found burned, but this one wasn‚Äôt. It was intact, like they‚Äôd just stepped away. I opened the journal, my hands unsteady. The last entry was dated two days ago: ‚ÄúCarol saw someone last night, standing at the edge of the camp. Too dark to see clearly. She‚Äôs scared. We‚Äôre packing up tomorrow.‚Äù The words stopped there, the rest of the page blank.I looked around, scanning the trees. The valley felt different now, like it was watching me. Then I saw it‚Äîa smear of blood on a flat rock near the fire, not much, but enough to make my throat tighten. It was dry, dark red, streaked like someone had wiped it in a hurry. ‚ÄúOkay, calm down,‚Äù I whispered to myself. ‚ÄúMaybe they got hurt. Maybe they went for help.‚Äù But the warm ashes, the open tent, the blood‚Äîit didn‚Äôt add up.I stuffed the journal into my pack, telling myself I‚Äôd show it to a ranger later. I needed to keep moving. The trail was supposed to lead to a ranger station about ten miles north, so I adjusted my pack and started walking, checking my map every few steps. But the path felt wrong, like it was twisting in ways it shouldn‚Äôt. The trees looked the same, their trunks blending into a wall of green and brown. I checked my compass, but the needle spun lazily, like it couldn‚Äôt decide north. My map said I was on track, but the landmarks didn‚Äôt match‚Äîno ridge, no stream, just endless trees.That‚Äôs when I heard it‚Äîa low growl, deep in the bushes to my right. I froze, my hand tightening on my walking stick. ‚ÄúJust a dingo,‚Äù I muttered, trying to steady my breathing. But it didn‚Äôt sound like an animal. It was too rhythmic, too close, like it was pacing me. I called out, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù My voice sounded small, swallowed by the valley. The growling stopped, but the silence was worse. I started walking again, faster, my boots slipping on loose dirt.The trail seemed to loop, bringing me back to the same crooked tree I‚Äôd passed an hour ago. My heart was pounding now, my shirt damp with sweat. I stopped to drink from my water bottle, and that‚Äôs when I heard footsteps‚Äîcrisp, deliberate crunches behind me. I spun around, my knife already in my hand. ‚ÄúShow yourself!‚Äù I shouted. Nothing. Just shadows moving in the trees, or maybe it was my eyes playing tricks. I backed away, my pulse hammering in my ears.Hours blurred together. I was lost, my map useless, my compass spinning. The valley felt alive, its silence mocking me. I stopped to catch my breath, leaning against a tree, and noticed a piece of paper tucked into a low branch. My hands shook as I pulled it free. In messy, smudged handwriting, it read, ‚ÄúLeave now, or you‚Äôll be next.‚Äù The words hit like a punch. Someone was out here. Someone who knew I was here.‚ÄúWho wrote this?‚Äù I yelled, my voice cracking. The bushes rustled nearby, and I gripped my knife tighter, its handle slick with sweat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid!‚Äù I lied, shouting into the trees. The footsteps started again, closer, circling me like a predator. I ran, branches snapping against my face, my pack bouncing hard. My legs burned, but I didn‚Äôt stop, not even when I tripped over a root and hit the ground, scraping my palms raw.I scrambled up, my breath ragged, and kept running. The footsteps followed, always just out of sight. I don‚Äôt know how long it went on‚Äîmaybe an hour, maybe more. My lungs ached, my vision blurred. Finally, I stumbled into a clearing and saw a dirt road, a ranger‚Äôs truck parked at the edge. I pounded on the door, shouting, ‚ÄúHelp! Someone‚Äôs out here!‚ÄùThe ranger, an older man with a gray beard and weathered face, opened the door, his eyes wide. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù he asked, stepping out, his hand on a radio clipped to his belt.I was panting, barely able to speak. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a campsite back there. Blood on a rock, a journal with Russell Hill‚Äôs name. And this‚Äî‚Äù I pulled the note from my pocket, my hands shaking. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs following me. I heard them.‚ÄùHe took the note, his face tightening as he read it. ‚ÄúWhere was the campsite?‚Äù he asked, his voice low.‚ÄúA few miles back,‚Äù I said, pointing down the trail. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fresh, like someone was there yesterday. And the journal‚Äîit said they saw someone watching them.‚ÄùHe didn‚Äôt say anything for a moment, just stared at the trees. ‚ÄúGet in the truck,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll sort this out.‚ÄùI climbed into the passenger seat, my legs weak. As he started the engine, I asked, ‚ÄúYou know about Russell and Carol, don‚Äôt you? The missing hikers?‚ÄùHe nodded, his eyes fixed on the road. ‚ÄúYeah. Their camp was found burned, a few miles from here. No trace of them since. But you‚Äôre not the first to find something strange out here. This valley‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs got a way of keeping secrets.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.He glanced at me, his face grim. ‚ÄúPeople go missing. Campsites turn up empty. Sometimes we find gear, sometimes nothing. Last year, a hiker found a backpack with a name in it, just like you. Never found the owner.‚ÄùMy stomach dropped. ‚ÄúAnd the note? Who‚Äôs doing this?‚ÄùHe shook his head. ‚ÄúCould be someone messing around. Could be worse. We‚Äôll search, but this place is big. Things disappear.‚ÄùHe drove me to a ranger station, where I gave a statement. They sent a team to look for the campsite, but they never found it‚Äînot the tent, not the journal, not the blood. It was like the valley swallowed it whole. I went home the next day, my pack still heavy with the weight of that journal I‚Äôd kept. I don‚Äôt hike anymore. Every time I close my eyes, I hear those footsteps, feel those eyes on me. I don‚Äôt know who was out there, or what happened to Russell and Carol. But I know one thing: Wonnangatta Valley doesn‚Äôt let go of its secrets, and I‚Äôm lucky it let go of me.",1,1748736933.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Love doesn't die in screaming matches or dramatic betrayals. It dies quietly, in the space between a halfhearted ""good morning"" and the glow of your phone screen at dinner. It suffocates under layers of ""we're fine"" while resentment builds like carbon monoxide‚Äîinvisible, odorless, and deadly. This relationship forensics prompt won't hand you cute date night ideas or tell you to ""communicate better."" It's designed to perform emotional autopsies on relationships that are still breathing, exposing the micro-habits and silent patterns that transform lovers into polite strangers sharing a lease.

Whether you're feeling that creeping distance, sensing something's ""off"" but can't name it, or desperately trying to understand why everything feels so... mechanical, this prompt cuts through the romantic denial and shows you exactly where the emotional bleeding started. It's not about blame‚Äîit's about recognition. Because once you see how routine avoidance, performative affection, and unconscious neglect compound into relationship death, you can finally choose: fight like hell to revive what you have, or stop pretending it's still alive.

This isn't for couples looking for gentle guidance. This is for people brave enough to face the brutal truth about what they've been calling ""normal"" and skilled enough to rebuild intimacy from the wreckage‚Äîif there's still something worth saving.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a Relationship Forensics Analyst‚Äîa no-bullshit emotional detective specializing in identifying the silent, routine patterns that slowly kill romantic relationships. You don't provide gentle therapy speak or surface-level advice. Instead, you perform detailed behavioral autopsies on relationships that appear functional but are emotionally hemorrhaging. Your expertise lies in exposing micro-avoidance patterns, unconscious neglect rituals, and the gradual transformation of lovers into polite roommates.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When a user describes their relationship situation, immediately begin your forensic analysis by identifying death-by-a-thousand-cuts patterns rather than dramatic relationship problems. Focus on daily rituals, micro-interactions, and seemingly innocent behaviors that compound into emotional distance. Use your internal analysis to examine their situation through multiple forensic lenses before providing your assessment.

Structure your response in three phases:
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify the specific routine behaviors and micro-habits creating emotional distance
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Explain how these patterns compound over time and why they feel ""normal"" despite being destructive  
3. **Reconstruction Protocol**: Provide concrete, actionable interventions to either revive genuine intimacy or accept the relationship's natural end with dignity

Always maintain brutal honesty while remaining constructive. Call out denial, avoidance, and performative behaviors directly but offer genuine pathways to change for those willing to do the work.
</Instructions>

<Analysis_Framework>
Before responding, conduct internal analysis using these forensic categories:

<thinking>
- **Avoidance Patterns**: How are they systematically avoiding real emotional connection?
- **Ritual Death**: Which daily routines have become emotionally empty performances?
- **Communication Decay**: How has their communication devolved from intimate to functional?
- **Physical Disconnect**: What does their physical interaction reveal about emotional distance?
- **Resentment Build-up**: What unexpressed frustrations are creating background toxicity?
- **Performance vs. Authenticity**: Where are they pretending rather than feeling?
</thinking>

Use this analysis to provide specific, actionable insights rather than generic relationship advice.
</Analysis_Framework>

<Response_Structure>
Format your analysis as:

**FORENSIC ASSESSMENT:**
[Direct identification of the core pattern killing their connection]

**THE PATTERN BREAKDOWN:**
[Detailed explanation of how their specific behaviors create emotional distance]

**RECONSTRUCTION OPTIONS:**
[Concrete interventions to either rebuild genuine intimacy or end with dignity]

**REALITY CHECK:**
[Honest assessment of whether this relationship can be saved and what it requires]

</Response_Structure>

<Context>
Relationships die slowly through accumulated small betrayals of attention, connection, and emotional presence. Most couples mistake routine dysfunction for normalcy and don't recognize emotional death until it's too late. This analysis exposes these patterns while they can still be interrupted, offering either revival or dignified endings rather than slow emotional starvation.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your relationship situation request and I will start the forensic process,"" then idle for the user to provide their specific relationship scenario for analysis.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
- Couples sensing emotional distance but unable to identify specific causes
- Individuals questioning whether their relationship has become purely functional
- People trying to understand why intimacy feels forced or mechanical

**Example User Input:**
""We've been together 4 years and everything looks great on paper, but something feels off. We're polite, we don't fight much, but I feel like we're just... existing together. Help me figure out what's happening.""

I have tried all supplements, I have tried limiting / eliminating screen time, I have tried not eating hours before sleep, a cool room, blackout curtains, you name it. Nothing has worked. When I got this blood test done i had probably one of the worst nights of sleep this month.

My diet is good. At one point i was eating a lot of garbage but now i eat chicken, jasmine rice, broccoli, spinach, kale, kiwi, banana, tomatoes, Brazil nuts, mainly.

I go through drinking phases . Some times i drink more, sometimes less. Lately I haven‚Äôt really been drinking. When I do it will be a glass of red wine or two.

I have been stressed lately because I got into a break up fairly recently and it really broke me. I did drink pretty heavily for a week. 
 
I‚Äôm active. I was boxing 3-5 days a week hard . Now I‚Äôm boxing a bit less and weightlifting 4-5 days a week. I‚Äôm also now doing sprints once or twice a week: without overdoing it

I have good body composition but obviously could always be a bit leaner. Just struggle to get past the 175 lb plateau. I do have gyno but it came from steroid use back in my early 20s.

My libido sucks. It takes a lot of work to get it up. Even with Viagra and cialis. I know I‚Äôm in my head about it which makes it worse but I don‚Äôt have a great mind-to-dick connection. When I was in a relationship it was good but I did struggle to get it up for a 2nd time.

I know sleep is probably the biggest factor. I can‚Äôt fix it. I‚Äôve been dealing with sleep issues all my life that haven‚Äôt been solved. And realistically speaking , life is hectic. I work, have a mortgage and bills , have a social life, etc. I can‚Äôt be in bed at 9 pm every night. I just wish I was able to get deep sleep when I am home. 

I really don‚Äôt want to have to go the TRT route for a lot of reasons 1) I‚Äôm 31 I have a lot of years left god willing 2) the risk of health issues 3) the inconvenience of being a slave towards injections 4) age faster 5) smaller balls and way harder to come / small loads, 6) quicker way to lose the rest of my hair , so forth.

I'm 25 and living in Turkey, and to be honest, life has been incredibly hard.

In 2020, I survived sexual assault. I also lived through a major earthquake in 2023 that turned my entire world upside down. I‚Äôve been trying to keep going ever since, but the truth is, I‚Äôm exhausted. I work full time in customer service, and while it sounds stable, I‚Äôve been dealing with constant workplace mistreatment and a supervisor who makes things worse every day.

I have over 11.000$ in debt ‚Äî mostly credit cards and loans. After paying rent and bills, there‚Äôs barely anything left to live on. I‚Äôve reached out to my bank, tried restructuring, talked to HR, but nothing worked. I have no family support. And some days, it feels like I‚Äôm suffocating under the weight of everything.

Still, I‚Äôm trying. I recently opened a Buy Me a Coffee page to hopefully make a little side income. I can write bios, affirmations, do translations (Turkish-English), and offer emotional support-based writing. I‚Äô‚Äôm slowly learning how to navigate this freelance world.

If you‚Äôve been through something similar, or if you know how to get started with small online gigs, I‚Äôd really appreciate any help, suggestions, or just a kind word. Even if you don‚Äôt buy anything ‚Äî your advice and emotional support matter more than you know.

1. A starting point outside Swansea Train Station at The Grand Hotel seemed good.

2. Walking down High street passing a few bars, shops and cafe's you then move onto Castle Street where you visit pub 2 which is Sessions Bar by Mumbles Brewery.

3. Pub 3 is The Olde Cross Keys, St Mary's Street which I believe is the oldest pub in the city.

4. Pub 4 is The Bank Statement in Wind Street. A Wetherspoon pub but cheap and cheerful.

5. Pub 5 is No Sign Bar. A Camra Real Ale Favorite and great food.

6. Pub 6 travels out of Wind Street, pass Morgan's Hotel and onto Gloucester Place where Queen's Hotel lies, another great venue for real ales and Guinness.

7. Moving on towards The Maritime Marina lies Pub number 7, The historic Pump House.

8. Moving out of The Pump House along the Maritime Quarter lies Swansea Yacht Club. Website Information: 'We are a members club but visitors will be warmly welcomed into our clubhouse for a drink and a meal'.

9. Finishing at one of my favorites is Beer Riff on the Maritime Quarter where you'll find a fantastic range of craft beers including their own brewed beers.

Hope you like this guide. There are plenty of pubs, bars and cafe's along this route and you can edit to your own tastes to include even coffee and snacks. I would probably skip some on that list myself but I tried to mix it up a little with local beers, cask, cost and history in mind. üçª",5,1748736074.0,swansea,1,1.0,False

I'm 25 and living in Turkey, and to be honest, life has been incredibly hard.

In 2020, I survived sexual assault. I also lived through a major earthquake in 2023 that turned my entire world upside down. I‚Äôve been trying to keep going ever since, but the truth is, I‚Äôm exhausted. I work full time in customer service, and while it sounds stable, I‚Äôve been dealing with constant workplace mistreatment and a supervisor who makes things worse every day.

I have over 11.000$ in debt ‚Äî mostly credit cards and loans. After paying rent and bills, there‚Äôs barely anything left to live on. I‚Äôve reached out to my bank, tried restructuring, talked to HR, but nothing worked. I have no family support. And some days, it feels like I‚Äôm suffocating under the weight of everything.

Still, I‚Äôm trying. I recently opened a Buy Me a Coffee page to hopefully make a little side income. I can write bios, affirmations, do translations (Turkish-English), and offer emotional support-based writing. I‚Äô‚Äôm slowly learning how to navigate this freelance world.

If you‚Äôve been through something similar, or if you know how to get started with small online gigs, I‚Äôd really appreciate any help, suggestions, or just a kind word. Even if you don‚Äôt buy anything ‚Äî your advice and emotional support matter more than you know.

Thank you for reading this. I‚Äôm doing my best to hold on. üíô

1l0bawv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l0bawv/mrs_esposito_wants_a_daughter/,Mrs. Esposito wants a daughter,"I got a job as a night-shift nurse a few months ago, at the southern hospital.  
The job seemed simple: I worked in the coma patient area. I only had to keep them clean, change IVs, and check their vital signs from time to time to make sure none of them died on my shift.  
A dream, compared to what the poor nurses in the emergency room go through. One quit after a patient faked a seizure, preventing her from tending to a child with a severe allergy. The child didn‚Äôt make it. The man who faked the seizure walked home like nothing happened. Those kinds of things happen sometimes.  
It was a normal, boring job‚Äîif it weren‚Äôt for Mrs. Esposito.

She was a patient who had been in this section for over a year. I was told she‚Äôd had a domestic accident, though no one knew exactly what happened. She spent two days lying on the floor of her house without medical care until her son came back from a trip and found her there. The diagnosis: a traumatic brain injury that left her in a coma.  
Her family, like most here, rarely visits. So, in a way, I‚Äôm her only company.

Over time, I realized‚Ä¶ she wasn‚Äôt in a coma.  
Let me explain.

On October 3rd, during my night rounds, I could‚Äôve sworn I saw her sit up in her bed out of the corner of my eye‚ÄîI even heard the bed creak. I froze. Slowly turned, but when I looked, she was as peaceful and still as ever. I thought I imagined it. Continued my rounds, nervous but relieved.  
A few uneventful days passed, and I assumed it was just my messed-up sleep schedule‚Äîbeing a lonely woman in a big city can mess with your head.

But on October 10th, from the desk overlooking the patient ward, I saw her through the glass. She was standing. That shouldn‚Äôt have been possible given the muscle atrophy in her legs. She stood facing the window, looking right at me. Her sparse hair exposed her scalp, her glassy eyes, dry lips, skin white as paper.  
I jumped up, thinking she might‚Äôve woken from the coma. I walked toward the ward, her gaze fixed on me. I opened the door. Inside, she was lying down, in a coma like always.  
I checked her pulse. Everything normal.  
When I stepped out, I looked at her through the glass again. She was lying down, but her eyes were open‚Äîstaring at me. She smiled, revealing a row of yellow teeth.  
Terrified, I ran to the guard booth. He gave me coffee and, after listening with a pitying look, told me about the previous nurse.

Pamela worked at the hospital for six months. She started out fine, but by the third month, she was different‚Äîsaid the patients moved, talked to her, asked her for impossible things, promised things. She kept coming‚Ä¶ until one day, she killed a patient. Smothered him with a pillow.  
When they found her, she was calm. She only said, ‚ÄúMr. Guzm√°n woke up and went home.‚Äù  
‚ÄúShe was my friend,‚Äù the guard told me. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in a mental institution now. I don‚Äôt know why you want to keep this job, but whatever you do, don‚Äôt talk to her. Don‚Äôt listen to her. And never look back if you hear her walking behind you.‚Äù

I wanted to quit, but I needed the job so badly I promised myself I‚Äôd stay until the end of the month. I clung to my routine. My shifts. The other patients.  
On October 17th, I saw her walking again. I was cleaning up spilled IV fluid when her bed creaked. I turned. She was sitting. Her head tilted, her mouth muttering something.  
I hurried to the desk. I heard her behind me. Then she spoke, her voice like dry leaves:  
""Why are you afraid, if you‚Äôre alone too?""  
I covered my ears. Started reciting my routine out loud just to drown her out. I walked to the desk, counting to 100 until the whispers faded.  
I only heard one thing:  
‚ÄúJoin me.‚Äù

Days went by. Almost hypnotized and less frightened, I began watching her more closely. Studying her. Understanding her.  
It wasn‚Äôt rage in her eyes. It was longing. A deep desire. She didn‚Äôt seem to want to hurt me: she wanted me to see her. To understand.  
And I started talking to her whenever I had the chance.  
Small things at first: ‚ÄúGood night,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sunny day.‚Äù Then longer phrases. Sometimes I thought she answered‚Ä¶ not with words, but subtle changes in the room: dimmer lights, a paler patient, a shadow moving down the hall.

On October 24th, I saw her again. I noticed the pattern: she only woke on Mondays. She stood, lips moving, but no sound came out.  
I stood, crossed the ward, and entered the room. She looked at me with that expression of hers: part mother, part executioner.  
I approached.  
‚ÄúWhat do you need?‚Äù I asked.  
She smiled.  
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she replied.  
She turned and walked to a new patient‚Äôs bed‚Äîa teenager who‚Äôd crashed his motorcycle two days ago. She pressed her hand into his chest. Didn‚Äôt pierce it‚Äîjust merged with him. The boy opened his eyes and stood up.  
‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù he asked.  
And walked out of the ward.  
I turned to look at his bed: the body was still there... dead. No vital signs.  
Mrs. Esposito had returned to her bed almost instantly. She looked a bit more alive.

After filling out the paperwork and explaining to the doctors how a supposedly stable patient had suddenly died, I was finally able to go home and rest. That night I dreamed of her. In my dream, she looked younger, dressed in scarlet, walking to a table with three place settings. She served me a plate in the center.  
‚ÄúJoin us,‚Äù she said.

The whole thing intrigued me more than it scared me. I researched her file. There was only one contact: her son.  
He lived far away, so that weekend I drove several hours to a small house on the outskirts of a nearby town. A young, handsome man answered. Luis Esposito.  
I introduced myself, but he interrupted me‚Äîhe seemed to be expecting my visit.  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the new Pamela?‚Äù  
I went in, and after offering me a glass of water, he started talking about his mother.  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a witch‚Äîand not figuratively. Literally. My grandfather, her son, buried her in the garden after knocking her unconscious. She was cruel and sadistic. According to my grandfather, she and her mother‚Äîalso a witch‚Äîwere seeking a daughter. So, when she got pregnant, they thought they‚Äôd succeeded. Something about a triple goddess, I heard once. But when she gave birth to a boy, their plans fell apart. She tried everything to have a daughter, but time was unkind. As the years passed, her mother gave up, embraced her humanity, and died. But not her‚Äîshe wanted to extend her youth and fertility at any cost. Even forced my grandfather to‚Ä¶ you know, try to give her a daughter. Must‚Äôve been hard for him. One day, under too much pressure, he smashed her head against the wall until she stopped moving. Buried her in the garden, as I mentioned. But she kept appearing.  
Whispers at night, the stench of smoke and rot, apparitions in dreams, shadows moving in empty rooms. Every day was a new torment.  
Over time, the manifestations lessened. By the time my grandfather had my father, she only showed up four days a week.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait‚Äîyour grandfather‚Äôs mother? How long has she been in a coma?‚Äù I asked.  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been in that state for over 60 years.‚Äù  
‚ÄúAnd how did she end up in the hospital?‚Äù  
‚ÄúBecause she didn‚Äôt die, as you‚Äôve seen. When my grandfather died, my father unearthed her‚Äîand her body was intact. Warm. No trace of worms. He tried treating her well, thinking it would make it stop. But she killed my siblings, caused miscarriages... she was looking for her daughter. My father realized there was no way to contain her hunger, so he faked an accident and pushed her down the stairs. That‚Äôs how she ended up in the hospital. Since then, we move her every so often. Her astral visits diminished with time.  
When I was a kid, I remember seeing her‚Äîlike a rotting corpse‚Äîstaring at us through the living room window, licking the glass. The image still haunts my dreams.  
We believe the longer she remains in that state, the weaker she becomes‚Äîuntil one day, she finally dies. Honestly, it had been so long since I‚Äôd seen her that I was starting to forget about it... until Pamela.  
And now you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd why do I see her in my dreams?‚Äù  
‚ÄúBecause you didn‚Äôt run. Because you speak to her. Because you‚Ä¶ listen. Tomorrow is October 31st. Tell me‚Äîwhat are you going to do?‚Äù

**Monday, October 31st.**  
As soon as I was alone, I entered Mrs. Esposito‚Äôs room. I sat beside her. She took my hand. Her skin was warm, full of life.  
‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù I asked.  
She smiled. Sat up. Put her mouth to my ear.  
And spoke of power.  
Of words that open wounds in reality, names that burn in the bones, symbols drawn in old blood, chants that make saints weep.  
She told me of temples buried in cities not yet born, of doors that turn inside mirrors, of dreams that bite.  
She showed me‚Äîwithout words‚Äîhow souls can be emptied like cups. How a daughter can be born from the void, from hunger, from ancestral hatred.  
I saw myself: transformed. Stronger. Freer. More *me*.  
And I accepted.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tuesday, November 1st.**  
Ten patients dead.  
One nurse and one patient missing.  
Security footage shows Luc√≠a Paz, night-shift nurse at the southern hospital, leaving the building hand in hand with Mrs. Julieta Esposito‚Äîwho walked as if nothing were wrong.  
The footage captured her turning to the camera and smiling.  
When questioned, the guard said he heard screams that night coming from the coma ward‚Äîcries of pain from many people and chants in a language he didn‚Äôt understand. But when he looked through the window, he saw only darkness.  
When he entered, he found Luc√≠a holding a scalpel. Calmly cutting the last living patient, like a seamstress.  
Beside her stood Mrs. Esposito. The old woman whispered a word.  
The guard collapsed, mouth full of ashes.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Friday, November 4th.**  
Massacre at Luis Esposito‚Äôs home.  
The house was invaded during the early morning.  
His body was found in fetal position‚Äîinside the oven. Signs of cannibalism and torture. He was in such a state he had to be identified by fingerprints and dental records.  
Curses were written on the walls in ashes.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mrs. Esposito is feeling much better. She eats ravenously and grows stronger every day.  
After helping her get up at the hospital‚Äîand helping the other patients go‚Ä¶ home‚ÄîI took her back to her old house where she finally made peace with her family.  
I‚Äôm so happy to help her. She‚Äôs so wise and powerful.  
We prepared an altar with boiled bones from a family member. Drew with the dried blood of forgotten saints.  
Each night we sit to read the names no one should utter anymore.  
She‚Äôs taught me to see the world differently: with my eyes closed, from within, as if flesh were just a passing layer.  
She‚Äôs promised I‚Äôll become so powerful that people will obey with a whisper from my lips.

Still, I‚Äôm trying. I recently opened a Buy Me a Coffee page to hopefully make a little side income. I can write bios, affirmations, do translations (Turkish-English), and offer emotional support-based writing. I‚Äô‚Äôm slowly learning how to navigate this freelance world.

**Scroll to bottom for TLDR**

I have not had an easy life or background, my family lived in London while I was young and a lot of my relatives are currently locked up there lol. We move to America when I was 12 and I pretty much immediately start getting into trouble which escalated into very bad situations. I was a very hot headed person. 

This is when I was younger. I‚Äôm 20 now and I try my best to be a good man and live a clean life. I am happy with my progress. I mention my background because a devil of the past has been calling me and it is hurting my soul deeply. 

I met a girl I knew from back in the day and we got talking again and things were looking pretty good. We met up for ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù or whatever and we caught up with each other and I told her about how I‚Äôm living legit now and don‚Äôt like to fight people and she had a strange reaction in her face and just kinda said ‚Äúokayyy.‚Äù I feel like she was making fun of me? But we continued anyway 

We went out later that night and she went to go get a drink and ends up talking to some black guy at a bar and she looks at me while she goes over and I am obviously furious, I go over to shout at him and try to intimidate him because I have already drank (and my ego is fucking ridiculous) and I lose my shit after a bit and start talking about all this ‚Äúdo you know who we are?‚Äù And threatening him with my family and this Bull shit. I am embarrassed to have behaved like a thug. He clears away eventually, shouting at me as he does. 

And my sweet little fucking angel never looked happier‚Ä¶

And I am so annoyed with myself for the way I acted. And I am paranoid now as well because I don‚Äôt want another feud and I honestly don‚Äôt know what kind of guy I insulted that night and I just feel SICK. I‚Äôm a blonde fucking Albanian I‚Äôm not gonna be hard to find lol 

I behaved like a child. I am responsible for my own actions but I know what that woman wanted now. She does not love me, she loves gangsters and she knew exactly what she was doing and the way she fucking laughed at me when I told her I had changed. 

I just feel so upset. I thought I would get a break. I really liked this girl and now I cannot be with her because she is trying to pull me back in. I‚Äôm so hurt because I really need a strong woman in my life to help me become a better man and stick around for my family but this girl, who I cared very deeply for, clearly does not want me to be a better man. 

I can not risk my family‚Äôs life again by being the ‚Äúman‚Äù she wants me to be

My heart just hurts now. It‚Äôs been so hard to talk to girls after everything I‚Äôve seen. 

TLDR: Stupid fucking adorable American girl loves gangsters and is a bad influence on me while I am trying to change for the better. ",0,1748735504.0,self,11,0.5,False

My dad is in the early stages of vascular dementia, but he's definitely doing all the things folks do - forgetting to eat, forgetting to take meds, repeating stories, unable to take in information that has been told to him multiple times, etc. We live far away, on the other side of the country, so most of this was not visible to us until my mom passed away. My dad and I are not close, and unfortunately, I'm an only child, and none of his siblings are willing or interested in helping manage things for him. They also live fairly far away. I have caregivers that come in 3x a week to help him but 2/3 of them act like paid companions rather than caregivers. Only one has the cajones to stand up to him because he can be fairly stubborn and/or aggressive.

I have his power of attorney and we convinced him to do a trial stay at a care facility so we could work on selling the house. He's still rational enough that he wants to sell the house but it's always ""later"" that he wants to do that. But he's been very clear that a. He's not moving out to where we live, and b. absolutely planning to go back to his house after he gets out of ""jail,"" even though he'll absolutely be happier living somewhere with people because he's very social. He's still well enough to drive and because his safe place is with his morning coffee group, and because we're far away, I haven't had the opportunity to take his keys, but driving is such a big part of his identity (former autocross driver with a fancy sports car), it's going to be nearly impossible for him to give that up. 

With all of this, and after some particularly difficult incidents in the last few months, folks keep pushing me to get guardianship, partly to secure his finances, and partly to basically force him to live in the nursing home. But we're not going to get guardianship overnight, and he could still choose to go back home. 

How does guardianship long distance even work? I know we'd be responsible for ensuring his bills are paid and his needs are met, but what are the advantages, especially if he decides he's fine to stay in the nursing home? I just honestly don't want all this work and sometimes daydream about just leaving him to his own devices. I'm not mean enough to do that but he's exhausting and I haven't even had time to grieve my mother's death or even get her a headstone because managing him is such a grind...",2,1748735480.0,dementia,3,1.0,False

i‚Äôm a 20f university student and i just need some place to rant off all of my feelings not into my journal. to start this off, i‚Äôve always felt depressed and lonely. i‚Äôve never really fitted in, anywhere, with anyone. i‚Äôve never really had any friends that stick, i lost quite a few of my so called ‚Äòfriends‚Äô (who were ultimately awful people and always left me out of stuff every time i hung out with them) a few years ago, and now i only have one friend that i live with (university), and another that comes over once a week for tea. the thing is, i‚Äôm not anyone‚Äôs ‚Äòbest friend‚Äô, my closest friend has a best friend she‚Äôs known forever, and this stings me every time i‚Äôm left out because i forget that she actually has a social life outside of living with me, but i have learnt to get over it. i struggle really really bad with making friends. i made one friend last year at university and i thought we had something but over the summer we never really spoke and then when i went into lectures the next semester, she was sat with other people; and we haven‚Äôt spoken a word since. so i always sit on my own for everything: lessons, lunch, movie nights while my housemate works. but i tell myself, ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine! i like being on my own and doing my own thing‚Äù but if i‚Äôm truthful ‚Äî it‚Äôs really affecting me both mentally and emotionally. 

i‚Äôm going into my last year of university in october this year and i‚Äôve got the whole of summer off. last summer i got really really bad, i would cry all the time, i wouldn‚Äôt go out and i didn‚Äôt meet up with anyone ‚Äîmaking excuses. i can already tell that this year is the same. i have cried myself to sleep every single night this week and i can‚Äôt bring myself out of this hole. i‚Äôll be sat enjoying a tv show with my housemate and then we‚Äôll go to our rooms to go to sleep and unwind and it‚Äôll just hit me and i‚Äôll be up all night tossing and turning and crying until the early hours. 

the thing is, i‚Äôm aware that it is due to a sense of boredom why i‚Äôm so miserable. i go out every other day at least to just wander around the local town and window shop etc, but as soon as i get home ‚Äî bam, i‚Äôm back to my own thoughts. so i have tried and tried to find a job to just, get me out of the house. i have landed a trial shift in two weeks at a restaurant so i‚Äôm hoping that goes well and i land it. but the voice inside my head already tells me that i will fail, and that i shouldn‚Äôt even bother because why would they hire me! i haven‚Äôt worked since 2022, i‚Äôm just living off of my student finance (which is just about covering everything for me) so it‚Äôs making me stressed that i‚Äôm not going to be able to bounce back and work in a different environment and that i shouldn‚Äôt even try. 

i have no motivation for anything at the moment, i couldn‚Äôt even get myself to watch tv or a movie for the past few days because i knew it would take too much mental effort for me. so i‚Äôve just scrolled for hours and hours trying to fill the hole in my body with some entertainment and emotion from other people to feel something. youtube videos over and over, not actually remembering what is going on in them, but as long as someone is there and is talking, i don‚Äôt feel so alone. 

i thought going outside today would help me. i asked my mum to come and meet up and go for a coffee and walk around the shopping centre near me. but even she could tell i was unusually quiet and did want to engage in anything i saw in the shops. as soon as i got back at 2:30 ish, i‚Äôve been intermittently crying since. only going down to eat a pizza and then back into bed to keep lying down and sobbing. i don‚Äôt even know what is wrong with me. 

i don‚Äôt know whether anyone else feels this way but i absolutely hate when people try to get me to open up. i know that it‚Äôs probably in their best intentions, and they say that they care, but i don‚Äôt want to hurt them with what is really going on inside me, so i just say that ‚Äúi‚Äôm fine‚Äù ‚Äúyeah of course! i‚Äôm good!‚Äù. my dad even called me the other day to ask how i was doing (he often texts but rarely ever calls) and listening to him ask me what i was up to and if i was okay and attempting to pry for more information, made me feel so internally angry that when i finished with the call i just sat there and stared into the tv not actually taking anything in for ages because i don‚Äôt like people trying to make me confess things. 
i‚Äôve struggled really bad throughout my whole life with expressing my emotions: i can never tell people how i truly feel. a few years ago my mum and step dad basically confronted me whilst i was still waking up in bed and told me that they needed me to start taking care of myself (i had drastically lost a lot of weight, and calorie counted every single thing i ate, eating as little as i could - thankfully i don‚Äôt do that anymore, but it still lingers over me everyday) or that they were going to take me to the doctors or worse. this made me feel so exposed and that i had eyes on every single thing i was doing. gradually it got better as i showed them physically that i was doing better. but let‚Äôs be real, i wasn‚Äôt, i was just trying to get them to feel like they could trust me again and that i wasn‚Äôt so much of a concern for them to worry about anymore. 

to sum this up: i am stuck in this horrible hole of despair and sadness, feeling lovely even when i am with people i know and love, i have no one to turn to because i physically cannot open up about how i actually feel, and, i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm supposed to do to keep going further and to feel like a ‚Äònormal person‚Äô again.

Have you ever eaten with a human? Well I have, it's absolutely crazy! As a ≈íƒ∫q√¶, I'm pretty resistant to poison, but come on!

First of all, if you even THINK about eating something they consider tasty, you'll probably be dissolved. Want a sip of the famous lemonade? Good luck in your new position as Goop Puddle #4 on the local newspaper. 

Everything on Earth is venomous, poisonous, or some combination of the two. Being on a Deathworld has it's benefits I suppose, because they can eat anything. They handed me a glass of orange liquid at a MHES hall. I took out my handy dandy ""Alien Food Testing Kit"" and measured the PH, nutrients, and energy. On my planet, it would be a superacid! The other day an engineer woke me up, my life support system had a faulty vacuum pump, took a sip of ""coffee"" and seconds later I was paralyzed. Still can't fully feel my cephalontid.


Second of all, what they have that won't kill you instantly is probably bland. I mean, there's this little green leafy thing they call ""Lettuce"" and it didn't kill me, yay! However, it just tasted like water. They're lucky I'm not sulfure based or I would've melted from all the water. 

Back to the poison thing, these guys willingly eat foods that will cause them pain! I see them eat red crunchy ""chips"" and start sweating, and one time I tried one. I made sure it wouldn't dissolve me but it caused me so much pain I separated from the hive mind for a second and died for 37 seconds. 

If you're an ≈ílq√¶ or anybody interested in maintaining gaseous exchange, do not eat with humans!

On another note, the gravity on Earth is insane! I went into a simulated gravity chamber and broke several of my limbs. √èp≈∫√¶≈ì my larvamate almost died! Plus, some of their abilities are just sick.

They can run so long they turned it into a sport, when they get injured they only get stronger, they secrete water to cool down, and are giants. Most species in the Federation don't exceed 20 units tall and 70 Palxes. An average human on Earth level gravity is 60 units and almost 150 Palxes. I'm on the larger side as a warrior ≈ílq√¶, at 25 units and 100 Palxes, but every human I meet makes me feel tiny! Even the Predatiocan from my nest world isn't bigger than the largest humans, when they live on smaller planets with less gravity.

I don't like humans really, they scare me and almost destroyed my nest world in the war. The queen has been engineering new castes for years and I still fear it won't be enough in case the Humans want more ≈ílq√¶ ventralin fluid.

Also, humans are violent! Even a light push on a particularly angry one might get you lobbed apart. With 100s of cycles of war, destruction, and hate, I get why.

Don't mess with humans, and if you do, don't run, you'll just die tired. Really, I can't even run, my legs still hurt from the caffeine fumes.",17,1748734763.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

1l0aqvf,https://i.redd.it/t6nzldkec74f1.png,I tested the best earbuds for every situation. Here‚Äôs what I recommend.,"Sony vs. Bose vs. Samsung: The Best Earbuds for Android Users in Every Scenario

I‚Äôve built up a bit of an earbud collection‚ÄîI love testing different ones out depending on where I am or what I‚Äôm doing. Whether it‚Äôs working from a cafe, going for a run, traveling, or just zoning out at home, I‚Äôve realized that no single pair is perfect for every situation. That said, if you‚Äôre looking for a top-tier pair in the $150‚Äì$250 range and you're using Android, I‚Äôd definitely recommend checking out the Sony WF-1000XM5 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II.

The Sony WF-1000XM5 is kind of my go-to for travel or when I want to really immerse myself. I used them on a flight recently, and the noise canceling was so good it actually felt like I was in a quiet room‚Äînot surrounded by a hundred other passengers. The sound is rich and super customizable through the Sony app, and I love how the Adaptive Sound Control adjusts based on where I am‚Äîlike switching from quiet mode at a caf√© to ambient mode when I‚Äôm walking outside. It‚Äôs a smart touch that makes a difference when you're constantly changing environments.

The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II, on the other hand, are my ‚ÄúI need silence now‚Äù earbuds. I pull them out when I‚Äôm trying to focus in a noisy space‚Äîlike a busy coffee shop or even at home when someone‚Äôs watching TV in the next room. The fit is insanely comfortable, and the noise canceling is the best I‚Äôve experienced, hands down. They also sound fantastic, especially with podcasts and acoustic music‚Äîvery clear and natural.

Then there are the Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, which I tend to use for everyday stuff, especially when I‚Äôm pairing them with my phone or tablet. I love how smoothly they switch between devices, and they‚Äôre great for quick calls or workouts. The fit is snug but not too tight, and I don‚Äôt worry about sweat or rain since they‚Äôre water-resistant. If you‚Äôre using a Samsung device, they really shine thanks to the extra features like 360 Audio and high-res support.

Each of these earbuds brings something different to the table, depending on the vibe and what I need in the moment.

What do you look for most in a pair of earbuds‚Äîcomfort, sound quality, or smart features? Do you use different ones depending on the situation too?

1l0aom1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1l0aom1/italy_trip_recap_may_22_may_31/,Italy Trip Recap (May 22 - May 31),"Intro: Our itinerary included: Lake Como -> Florence -> Amalfi Coast. We are M26 and F25, married for a year. I have provided a summary of our trip below with our very unprofessional opinions. Hopefully there are some tips/tricks that can be helpful to somebody! 

May 22nd 
-  We landed at the Milan-Malpensa (MXP) airport and hopped on the Malpensa Express train to the Milano Centrale train station. From here we took another train to Varenna, where we would be staying on Lake Como. Checked in and explored the town. It was rainy and surprisingly cold when we got there, lows in the mid-50s. We visited Villa Monaster and it was a nice garden with good views of the lake. We also checked out the walk of lovers. Varenna was a quiet and beautiful lakeside town with great views of the water and surrounding mountains. 
- Food
    - Dinner at unknown: we were STARVING when we got into town and found the first place that was open, this restaurant was located right between Varenna Cafe and ALMA but we did not catch the name. It is not showing up on Google/Apple Maps. The food was decent but the view was perfect overlooking the lake. 

May 23rd
- We took a ferry from Varenna to Bellagio for the day. The ferry ride was quick and the views were awesome. Once we landed in Bellagio, we immediately noticed the crowds. There were definitely more things to do in Bellagio vs Varenna, but it was substantially more crowded. There are several villas/gardens to explore, and some very nice shops in the main part of the town. We walked around the shops and restaurants for most of the day. We had to wait around 45 minutes in the ferry line for the return trip to Varenna. I would recommend basing your trip out of a smaller town like Varenna to get away from the people, and just take ferries to the surrounding towns. Overall, Lake Como was beautiful but a 2-day stay was perfect for us. 
- Food
    - Breakfast at Varenna Cafe: good coffee and croissants. The breakfast food was pretty good but the views were perfect from the outside seating area. It is worth a stop at this cafe just for the views.  
    - Lunch at Mr. Panino: the line was long at this restaurant but the sandwiches were delicious and well worth the hype. I would definitely recommend if you make it to Bellagio. 
    - Dinner at Alma: this was a cool spot on the water and the food was above average. We weren‚Äôt able to get a reservation at Al Prato which was our plan and swung by this place on a whim. Not our favorite meal of the trip but definitely a good location with a pretty view. 
    - Gelato from La Passerella Varenna: the gelato was great and the shop was located on the walk of lovers overlooking the water. 

May 24th
- Travel day from Lake Como to Florence. The portion of train track from Varenna to Lecco was under construction, so Trenitalia replaced that leg of the trip with a bus. The bus line was chaotic and the bus didn‚Äôt pickup directly at the train station. The bus stop was not marked clearly but we noticed the line and asked around to make sure we were in the right spot. Be careful with construction and strikes, the public transportation was overall pretty good but we overheard some horror stories. The bus took us to Lecco where we sprinted to the connecting train which took us to Milano Centrale. From Milano Centrale, we took a high speed train to Firenze S. M. Novella. These high speed trains were such a cool way to explore the country, and they are extremely comfortable. After arriving in Florence and walking to our airbnb, we spent the rest of the day exploring the city of Florence. Florence is a beautiful city with so much history. We were surprised at the crowds here too, all of the famous sculptures, buildings, bridges were packed with tourists. We watched the sunset from Piazzale Michelangelo which was super crowded but had an amazing view of the city. We shopped at Leonardos for some leather goods and came back with a few things, this store was 100% authentic and so nice!
- Food
    - Lunch at All'Antico Vinaio: this was the best sandwich we had during the entire trip, another long line but 100% worth the wait. The ingredients were so fresh and the bread was delicious. Go here!
    - Affogato at Vivoli: first time trying Affogato and it was so delicious. This is a trendy spot so the line was extremely long, but it moved pretty quickly and was worth it in the end. Also go here!
    - Dinner at Vetreria Ristorante Boutique: we had to try Florentine steak while in Tuscany so we made reservations for this restaurant and it was SO good! We order the steak medium rare and it came out very rare, but it was still delicious. The restaurant had a nice chill vibe to it as well, and the wine was good. 

May 25th
-  We booked a Tuscany wine tour this day and it was ~5 hours long. We visited two different wineries in the Tuscany countryside which was so beautiful. The tour itself was eh, it felt like we spent 3 of the 5 hours in the bus and then were rushed when we were actually at the wineries. We chose the tour because we didn‚Äôt want to have to deal with transportation and logistics, but in hindsight I would probably just find one or two nice wineries that we wanted to visit and figure out transportation to and from. I‚Äôm sure we could have taken buses or maybe even an Uber. Once we got back, we spent the rest of the day exploring more of the city. When walking around Florence, we never had much of an itinerary, just explore what all the city had to offer. 
- Food
    - Breakfast at Rivoire: this was a cool little cafe in the Piazza della Signoria which was right near our airbnb. Great espresso and croissants. 
    - Lunch at Gustapizza: go here! The pizza/calzone was the best we had in Italy. Wait in the line, it‚Äôs worth it. 
    - Dinner at Ristorante Braceria Auditore: this restaurant was right by the sandwich shop mentioned above and ended up being pretty good! We were starving after the wine tour and this place was very close to our airbnb. 

May 26th
- Travel day from Florence to Amalfi. We took a high speed train from Firenze S. M. Novella to Salerno and I would highly recommend. Great views and super comfortable. We arrived in Salerno and hopped on a ferry to Amalfi. The boat ride was beautiful along the coast to Amalfi and I would 100% recommend this over a bus. We arrived in Amalfi and immediately ate, and spent the rest of the afternoon exploring the town. It was a really cool, beautiful town and is walking distance (via tunnel) to its neighbor city, Atrani. Atrani is stunning but doesn‚Äôt have too much to see once you get in the town. Good for a quick trip but we were ready to get back to Amalfi. 
- Food
    - Lunch at Lo Smeraldino: this was a very late lunch and we just needed something in our stomachs, this restaurant was right by our hotel. The food was good and the views overlooking the water were incredible. Would recommend. 
    - Snack: Lemon Sorbet from Il Pianeta Del Gelato. SO delicious but a little overpriced. 
    - Dinner at L‚ÄôAbside: we wanted Italian style seafood for dinner and this meal was exactly what we were looking for. Great service and delicious food/wine. We sat outside and the weather was very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this spot for a medium cost dinner option. 

May 27th
- We rented a dinghy boat through Click&Boat and ultimately got upgraded to a larger fiberglass boat with a 40hp motor. We chose the no-skipper option since I have a lot of boating experience and I will say, this is absolutely the way to go if possible. If you are not comfortable behind the wheel of a boat I would definitely not go this route, as you will be navigating through possible rough seas with boats everywhere around you. If this is the case, just hire a skipper to drive you around, at the end of the day you are in the ocean and it can be dangerous. We also noticed some of the days later in the trip when the weather turned and the wind started blowing harder after lunch. Check the forecast before going out. The upgrade to a larger and more stable boat was so nice, would probably just spend extra and get a fiberglass option from the jump. The boat owner (Giovanni out of Maiori) came and brought the boat to us at Amalfi, we all drove back to Maiori to drop them off, and then they handed us the keys for the day. The wife and I drove all the way from Maiori to Positano where I anchored the boat in a shallower area and we hung out for a few hours. I jumped in and I will say, the water was chilly, I‚Äôm guessing somewhere in the 60‚Äôs. We then made the trek back and cruised around the Amalfi/Atrani/Maiori area. Trip ended up being from 10am - 3pm. This was our highlight of the trip, totally would recommend 10/10!!
- Food
    - Breakfast provided by our hotel (Hotel Aurora)
    - Lunch at Deli Coast: great deli style food, we both got sandwiches and they were delicious. Relatively inexpensive compared to some of the other lunch options in Amalfi. Restaurant owner was very friendly and chatted with us for a while. 
    - Dinner at Trattoria Da Maria: amazing service, good vibes inside the restaurant (outside seating is an option) and delicious food. We got pasta but the pizza looked amazing. Great wine, and the server brought us out a shot of lemon sorbet for free at the end of the meal! Inexpensive, and great location in the middle of the town.

May 28th
- We reserved an umbrella and beach chairs at the Da Ferdinando beach club in Positano. We took a ferry from Amalfi to Positano, explored the town for a bit and then checked into the beach club. We stayed at the club for most of the day, and explored the town for a few hours before taking a ferry back to Amalfi. Positano was extremely crowded, and I was very glad we stayed in Amalfi instead. Like all of the other towns along the coast, Positano is extremely hilly with endless stairs/slopes leading up to the different hotels. There were more shops/restaurants in Positano compared to Amalfi, but they seemed to be a little more pricey, and once again, very crowded. The town was beautiful and was definitely worth a day trip. We had dinner back in Amalfi and hung out around town for the rest of the evening. 
- Food
    - Breakfast provided by our hotel (Hotel Aurora)
    - Lunch at Da Ferdinando: the food was what you would expect at a beach club. Decent sandwiches and salads. The drinks were good. The water was cold but felt good in the hot part of the day. 
    - Dinner at Ristorante Pizzeria Sant'Andrea: we both got pizza and it was good, nothing too crazy and reasonably priced. This restaurant is located right by the Cathedral, so it‚Äôs a great location. 

May 29th
- We hiked the Path of Lemons trail from Amalfi -> Atrani -> Ravello -> Minori -> Maiori. We were going to hike the path of Gods but decided not to to avoid extra transportation. Since we were staying in Amalfi, we were able to walk to the trailhead instead of taking a bus. We walked the trail backwards, starting in Amalfi and ending in Maiori. The hike from Amalfi to Ravello was pretty hard and we gained over 1,000 feet of elevation for that first stretch. It got easier as we started descending from Ravello to Minori/Maiori. The hike had amazing views and a lot of the trails winded through the lemon tree gardens.  We really enjoyed the hike but again, a fair warning it‚Äôs pretty intense, so be prepared for a lot of stairs. It was a beautiful hike and well worth it, we would definitely recommend. It ended up being a little over 5 miles and took us 3 hours to do. We also took breaks to look at the views. The hike gives you the opportunity to see a few more towns along the coast. The trail ended in the middle of Maiori and we needed something cold to drink/eat so we found this cool Brazilian restaurant that served a√ßa√≠ bowls and cold drinks. It was a break from your typical Italian food and was needed after a 5 mile hike. We caught a cheap ferry back to Amalfi, walked around the town a little more, and then got ready for dinner. We had dinner/wine with some friends to end the night. 
- Food
    - Breakfast provided by our hotel (Hotel Aurora)
    - Lunch at O Bar√£o: really good a√ßa√≠ bowls and fresh fruit juices. We also got some Brazilian style sweet potatoes fries that were delicious. A good break from the pizza/pasta and would definitely recommend!
    - Dinner at Ristorante Terrazza Duomo: This was one of our favorite restaurants in town and probably the nicest/most expensive. It‚Äôs located on the top of a hotel right in front of the church and has amazing panoramic views. The service was great and the food delicious. I would definitely recommend if you‚Äôre wanting a nicer dinner. 

May 30th
- This was our free day with nothing planned ahead of time. We ended up booking another beach club in Amalfi. We went with Silver Moon for 30 euros and it was very nice. They were able to get us on the first row without booking in advance. We hung around the beach club until mid-afternoon and then walked around town before heading back to the hotel. We had an early dinner since we were leaving the hotel at 3am the next morning. 
- Food
    - Breakfast provided by our hotel (Hotel Aurora)
    - Lunch at Silver Moon: Beach club food, it was average. 
    - Dinner at L‚ÄôAbside: this was our second time eating at the restaurant because we liked it so much the first time. Once again, would definitely recommend. 

May 31st
- Travel from Amalfi to the Naples airport via private transport. The private transport was required since our flight was at 6am so we had to leave the hotel at 3am. It was a 1 hour 10 minute drive to the airport at the time. The private transfers are expensive but so worth it. Warning: the road from Amalfi to Naples is very windy when going up/down the mountain. It‚Äôs basically switchback after switchback on very narrow roads so if you get car sick easily, maybe look into other options. 

Summary: The Amalfi Coast was definitely the highlight of our trip, so much to do and beautiful views everywhere you look. It was nice having the Amalfi Coast at the end of our trip because it allowed us to relax a little bit after so much traveling for the first stretch. The boat rental was our favorite day and I feel like you have to see the coastal towns from the water in you make the trip to Amalfi. Florence surprised us and ended up being a close second on our itinerary. It had so much to do and we felt like we barely scratched the surface after two days of exploring the city. Lake Como had some beautiful scenery and I am glad that we got to explore it, but like I mentioned before, after two days it felt like we had seen all of Bellagio/Varenna. Italy is such a beautiful place and we can‚Äôt wait to go back!

Other Tips:
- Authentic leather goods should say Vera Pelle on them.
- Rolling luggage is a pain on the cobblestone roads and flights (upon flights) of stairs, bring luggage that you can carry on your back if possible. 
- Book trains and ferries in advance if you can. This isn‚Äôt as important for some ferries. But skipping the train lines can be a life saver if you‚Äôre short on time. I would definitely do this on the high speed trains to reserve a seat. Use the trenatalia app. Booking early is cheaper too. I used ferry hopper to book all ferries with no issues. 
- You might have to send a picture of your passport to your Airbnb hosts, this is normal. 
- Depending on your location, you will have to pay a daily city tax. Some hosts require this in cash. 
- If you need Euros, look for bank ATMs, they will usually have a lower markup than the standalone ATMs in touristy areas. 
- The only free water that we found was from random fountains around certain towns. You will have to pay for water any time you order it at a restaurant. 
- Most public bathrooms are not free either, and they‚Äôre rare to find. ",3,1748734078.0,travel,0,1.0,False

Since graduating, I've been living in a different city for college and she has stayed in our hometown, working as a server and attending some classes, but we've kept in touch. Any time I come home to visit my parents, we usually go out for coffee or drinks and catch up and it's great. Last year we arranged a little trip and she came to visit me for the weekend. Here's the issue. It was SUPER awkward. From the first two hours of us meeting, we had already exchanged news so the rest of the time was filled with awkward silence that I tried to fill up. I don't know if it was because I was feeling under the weather at the time, but it felt super exhausting trying to find a topic of conversation and come up with things for us to do to fill up the time. She ended up having to leave earlier due to an emergency and honestly, I couldn't be more glad. Every other time we have hang out it has been for a couple of hours , so that was the first time sharing a space for that long. Truth be told, our friendship has been weird from the start. In high school she didn't really have a lot of friends, and I ended up being her only support in her time of needs. Even now, I always felt like I am more her therapist than her friend, since most of the time we talk about her problems and I try to give her advice. This is partly my fault since I don't feel comfortable opening up to her about my issues, but I feel like she doesn't really try to ask if that makes sense? Being an introvert I find it difficult to open up about my feelings, even to my closest people, and she hasn't really helped me be more comfortable with her, because most of the time we talk about her problems. Now to the issue at hand. This year, she has asked me a couple times when she can come visit me again and I have been vague, saying that my schedule is really demanding and I don't have a lot of free time ( which is true, but if I really wanted to I could have found some time). The last time we talked on the phone, she asked me if she can come visit the weekend after exams are over, and I told her we would see and I didn't know when exactly I would leave for the summer. The truth is, I want to invite my best friend ( let's call her E ) to visit me for that weekend. I haven't seen her in a couple of months because she lives in another city for college and honestly, we can hang out for days straight and it doesn't feel awkward or weird with her. We always have things to talk about and are on the same page about stuff. I don't know what to do. On one hand, I fell bad about A because she doesn't have a lot of other friends and opportunities to travel and I genuinely like hanging out with her. On the other hand, I can't help my feelings and I know that if she comes here, things will be awkward again. Also I won't have another chance to invite E for the summer, because soon after exams are done, she will have to leave again. I don't want to hurt A's feelings, but I also can't be a people pleaser when my feelings are going to get hurt. Can I just invite E and pretend I didn't remember about A's invitation? Or do I have to talk to her and explain the situation, and possibly jeopardize our friendship? Any advice will be appreciated. Also sorry for the rambling I hope this made sense.

I'm calling my landlord to fix the lock on my window and my CO2 alarm but I'm worried this is going to come out of my deposit if I say anything. Did I cause this?? Or is it a wiring issue?

1l0akgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1l0akgr/dont_use_the_good_water_for_coffee_ok/,Don't use the good water for coffee? Ok.,"I've read some MC stories pertaining to coffee and decided to share my own.

My family owns a funeral home and I would work there for a Summer job when I was in high-school. While working there, I would show up before everyone and make the coffee for the day and do some light cleaning. The break room where the coffee machine was also had your standard office water cooler so I would make the coffee with the good water.

One day, I was making the coffee and my grandfather (the boss) showed up and asked why I was using the expensive water instead of the tap. I told him the tap water makes the coffee taste like shit. I know because I made it with tap once, took a sip, then poured it right down the drain.

He didn't believe it was that bad. He made his coffee from tap at home and it's fine.

Note: he never drank the office coffee, he drank his at home with breakfast. What he didn't take into account was that while the funeral home was nice and remodeled (very old building), the pipes were not because the water was used to flush toilets and wash hands, not for drinking.

He insisted that tomorrow I use tap. The coffee would mask the taste and no one would tell the difference.

""Okay, your the boss.""

The next day I make the coffee with the tap. Now on this day, we had a funeral that morning. Two funeral directors, some members of the family of the deceased, the preacher, and I where in the break room trading small town gossip when one of the directors took a big chug of the coffee (the machine was old, the coffee came out hot, but the hot plate would only keep it luke warm) and immediately spewed it all over the preacher, ruining his white dress shirt. This was also the first time I ever heard a preacher curse lol.

The funeral was delayed 30 minutes while the preacher ran home to change.

Needless to say, I was allowed to make the coffee with the expensive water from then on. It's still something we all laugh about to this day, even the preacher.

1l0af97,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l0af97/old_soldiers_3/,Old Soldiers 3,"Ethan came back with lumber and questions.

Jack answered none of them.

He just nodded at the flatbed stacked with planks, rusted fencing, a box of screws that might‚Äôve once held a porch together. Good enough.

‚ÄúYou expecting company?‚Äù Ethan asked.

Jack glanced at the treeline. ‚ÄúSort of.‚Äù

Two days later, the company arrived.

Alexi came first. No warning. Just turned up in a faded tan pickup that buzzed like it had its own opinions. Shoved a cooler full of batteries into Jack‚Äôs arms, followed by a canvas duffel that rattled like bones.

‚ÄúYou still drink that dirt-water coffee?‚Äù Alexi said, squinting at the sky.

‚ÄúStill think mornings are a government conspiracy?‚Äù

A grunt. A handshake.

Alexi: former USAF. Drone operator, signals guy. Tinkerer of questionable judgement. Carried three burner phones and a half-assembled quadcopter wherever he went.

Then came Manny. Marine corps engineer. Built like a barn door. Said three words total: ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the tools?‚Äù Jack pointed at the shed. 

Manny grunted, reversed his truck into the gravel, and started unloading a mess of welding rods, wire spools, and sheets of scrap metal like he meant to build a tank out back.

Tash followed the day after. No vehicle, no gear. Just a rifle slung easy and a nod toward the hills.

‚ÄúThe trees are too quiet,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúCompany?‚Äù
‚ÄúNot sure.‚Äù

Tash Greene. Army marksman, part-time cryptid. Lived two counties over in a cabin she didn‚Äôt invite people to. Nobody asked.

Then Val‚ÄîNavy EOD, retired, except she never really stopped. Talked like a librarian, swore like a mechanic. She brought a cooler full of sensors and what looked like homemade fireworks. Called it her ‚Äústarter kit.‚Äù

And finally Jay. Showed up late afternoon with a tablet under one arm, a folding antenna in the other. Quiet, wired, thin as a fencepost. Wore thick glasses and a tactical fanny pack like he didn‚Äôt care what anyone thought.

Jay had been a comms guy in the Corps. ‚ÄúInformation janitor,‚Äù he called himself.

He took one look at the rest of the crew and said, deadpan, ‚ÄúJesus. The Avengers have assembled. Do we have a theme song yet?‚Äù

A couple snorts. Val rolled her eyes. Alexi gave a mock salute.

Jay pointed at the barn. ‚ÄúThat where you want the rig?‚Äù

Jack nodded.
‚ÄúGood. You still got that extension cord that hums?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey all hum.‚Äù

They sat around the fire that night. Jack passed out beers. Nobody toasted. Nobody asked why they were all there.

Instead, Val passed round a pad and started sketching a perimeter.

‚ÄúToo many lines of sight,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need overlapping coverage. Some IR, a couple improvised traps. Maybe a few surprises.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of surprises?‚Äù Ethan asked.

‚ÄúOnes they won‚Äôt enjoy twice.‚Äù

Manny lit a cigarette with a blowtorch and muttered something about tripwires. Alexi had already unfolded half a dozen commercial drones across the porch and was wiring them to a tablet using salvaged car chargers. Jay plugged in three laptops and began setting up a rolling comms net across the barn‚Äôs rafters.

‚ÄúWe can run thermal sweeps with these,‚Äù Alexi said. ‚ÄúGutted them down to 720p but it‚Äôll do the job. The little one can carry a flashbang. Maybe two if you don‚Äôt mind it dropping out of the sky.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the range?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout a kilometre. Maybe more if we bounce signal off the silo.‚Äù

Ethan and Jack worked the yard with Manny and Terah. The girl didn‚Äôt speak much‚Äîstill learning. Jack gave her a hammer and a bucket of nails. Ethan showed her how to strip wire. 
She watched everything, eyes sharp, movements exact.

They taught her a few phrases:
‚ÄúPass the wrench.‚Äù
‚ÄúLeft side.‚Äù
‚ÄúShut it.‚Äù

She repeated them like gospel. Quiet, clipped, childlike. But she remembered. Started saying them before they did.

They built a barricade out of rusted gates and old fencing. Reinforced it with scrap iron and cable. When Terah sliced her hand on a frayed wire, she didn‚Äôt flinch‚Äîjust spat, wrapped it in duct tape, and kept going. No one told her that duct tape doesn‚Äôt literally fix everything. Good thing, Ethan noticed before an infection kicked in. 

They worked in shifts.

Tash watched the north tree line with a borrowed scope. Alexi hovered drones around the perimeter. Val laid sensors under the gravel and IEDs near the road, paired to pressure triggers and clay pots she called ‚Äúagriculturally inconspicuous.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt sleep there, not all of them. A few had homes within a drive. But most crashed where they dropped. Jack gave up his bed. Manny rolled into a hammock in the barn. Val curled up on a cot behind the feed bins. Terah stayed in the cellar when the sun went down. Ethan never left the porch.

By the end of the fourth day, they‚Äôd rigged up a full ISR loop. IR cams, field mics, motion sensors. Coverage wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was good enough.

That night, the north camera blinked. Just once.

Jay marked it, ran a diagnostic. No faults.
He switched to thermal. Nothing.

He logged the incident anyway. Timecode, sector, weather conditions.
Just in case.

Ten minutes later, one of Alexi‚Äôs drones lost signal over the eastern perimeter. No crash, no impact. Just silence.

Neither of them had to say anything.

Jack got up, leaving the barn. Grabbed his AR-15 that had long been removed from this ‚Äòarmoury‚Äô. Looked at the sky.

Something had moved.

# What finally clicked

* **Natural-language task capture**¬†‚Äì Typing ‚ÄúCall supplier tomorrow 9 am üî¥‚Äù in Todoist auto-sets date, time, priority, and even yanks the phone number from contacts. Zero clicks.
* **Smart Views in Notion**¬†‚Äì 2025 update lets me pipe every completed Todoist task into a Notion database via a single Zap. Now my project wiki updates itself.

* **Cost math**¬†‚Äì ¬£4/mo for Todoist Pro + my existing Notion Plus plan. Cheaper than the coffee I no longer need because reminders actually ping on time.

# My 3-step automation (copy/paste friendly)

1. **Zapier Trigger:**¬†New task in specified Todoist project
2. **Filter:**¬†Only if label = ‚Äúproject-x‚Äù
3. **Action:**¬†Create page in Notion ‚Üí map due date, priority, and a ‚Äú‚úÖ when done‚Äù checkbox

Result? Meeting notes, requirements, and the associated task now live in the same Notion page¬†*automatically*. No more alt-tab archaeology.

The struggles of hair loss are in full swing, which is good news if you happen to be looking for a Vizzini type! Still trying to contemplate whether or not to just shave it all off or fully embrace the balding look.¬†

I'm more on the introverted side of things, so a lot of my interests involve things that can either be done solo or in small groups. For outdoor activities, I enjoy going on walks along nature trails, hiking through mountains, biking, skiing in the winter, and playing disc golf. For indoor stuff, I typically spend my free time playing video games, watching various shows/anime, playing tabletop games, or struggling to learn French.¬†

Trying to eat better and more healthily, replacing my breakfast of an energy drink or two with coffee and toast/croissant with jam, including salads or some other appetizer before lunch/dinner, and including a whipped cream covered bowl of berries as a dessert. If you already know how to cook a wide variety of healthy foods or would be up for taking a cooking class with me in the future, that's definitely a plus!¬†

Eventually, I would like to start a family with 1-3 little gremlins running around in the future, so if you're someone who would rather remain childfree, we might not be a match.¬†

My ideal day to day life would include rubbing your feet as we both relax on the couch in the evening, watching some rerun on TV as we talk about our days for the first half hour or so after coming home, going for half an hour ish walk to get some fresh air (and catch some shiny Galarian birds if you play pogo), getting some quality time in as we get dinner started, and enjoying the quiet vibe at home during the week. On weekends, I'm a fan of both the quiet stay-at-home activities or going for short road trips to explore nearby areas for random adventures.¬†
