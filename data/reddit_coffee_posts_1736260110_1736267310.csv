With my new setup, I’ve been having pretty bad stomach pain and nausea after drinking my oat milk lattes. This is what I usually order at coffee shops and I’ve never had any stomach issues. I used to have a Nespresso, and I had no issues with that either. 

I always drink coffee at least 30 mins-1 hour after eating a big breakfast, and I stay pretty hydrated throughout the day (aim for 100oz). I’m not sure what else could be the issue. Is my body just not used to daily espresso? 

Currently I’m using cheap grocery store beans as I learn to dial in the new machine. I’ve been doing 18g shots, but tomorrow I’m going to switch to 9g in the single shot basket to see if that changes anything. I did run multiple water cycles through the machine before pulling my first shot, and it’s a brand new machine. Any other tips? ",1,1736266918.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Hi! I’m doing my Masters + PhD in London :) I was raised in both the US and UK over the years so my accent throws people off (I just embrace it as an international school accent). I did my undergrad in the US and then moved back home because I wanted to be closer to family and I miss rainy London. About me: I love to run, swim, hike. My hobbies include, crafting, cooking, reading, movies, and music. My preferred drink is a Matcha Latte but I also really love coffee. My studies and work keep me incredibly busy but ever so often I crave some good deep conversations with a hint (a lot) of sweetness.  I enjoy having academic conversations since I love learning new things. I’m a big fan of staying in and if I could I would probably never leave my house. I’m incredibly open to sharing pictures and eventually talking over voice call and I love questions so feel free to ask me anything:))

I 23M started working at this company 6 months ago and my coworker 28F had been here for 3 years. For the first 3 weeks everything was normal and I was getting a handle of how things ran and after this my coworker took initiative to help out and informally teach me some stuff about the job that she had learned during her time here. I thought she was being nice and helpful so I gladly took her help and learned. After around a few weeks I felt I had a pretty good handle on everything and thanked her for her help but said I felt I was good to work on my own. After this almost every time I got up to get a coffee, water or use the bathroom, she would find a way to come and strike up conversation while I was walking. As well as frequent desk visits. After some time of being friendly she asked me to come for drinks with coworkers however I was watching football at a bar with my friends that night so I told her that and guess who showed up at that small bar alone halfway through the game. She did and she kept buying me drinks and finally made the proposition that we go to her place. I told her that I don't mess around with coworkers like that (this has happened a few years ago where I had a thing with someone I worked with and it flamed out after a few months and became very uncomfortable until I left). After I told her this the visits lessened for a few weeks and now after returning from the break it is right back to before except now she has asked me to go for drinks three times in the past two weeks all of which I have made excuses for. This along with her making some suggestive comments when at my desk has made me realize I need to shut it down. 
How do I go about this as I don't want my work environment for the foreseeable future to be as uncomfortable as my last? Are people more professional and mature about this when the job is more serious or is there a certain way I should go about handling this as I don't want it to escalate any further.

My name is Rence and I'm a freelance web designer. I specialize with Figma, WordPress and Elementor (I can also build on Squarespace). If you are a small to medium-sized business looking to increase their visibility online, then we might be a good fit.

Why so cheap? I'm actually looking for side projects that I can do to update my own [portfolio](https://rencejain.com/portfolio/) since a lot of designs here doesn't reflect my current skill level. I feel like it would be a waste if I created demo websites so I might as well help someone with their website and get paid for it.

Rest assured that you'll still be getting my top quality work. The only catch is that it will take longer than usual (4 to 6 weeks) since I have main projects I'm working on right now. **If you need the website anytime soon, this is not for you.** And if you need something more customized, here is my [main gig](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1hj781a/for_hire_freelance_web_designer_projectbased/) for more information.

There are specific website projects that I can give you more discounts for since I personally want to design for them:

* Photography
* Wedding photography
* Vacation resort
* Coffee shop
* Fitness coach

If not, that's fine! I'm sure we'd still be able to work something out so please feel free to reach out.

That's it for me! If you have any questions, concerns or even just want to say hello and show some support, feel free to reach out to me through [webdesign@rencejain.com](mailto:webdesign@rencejain.com). Let's see if we'd be a good fit and cook something good (: Have an awesome day!

When someone is being negative or treats me unfairly - I just cut them off, I don’t want to hear them, see them or know what reasons they had to behave like an asshole. 

I get defensive and I don’t like it, more touchy than it is worth for. 

The situation: I just came after a long vacation and my colleague (that I play dnd with and i thought established somewhat friendship with) is always negative and rude like (which is untypical, he wears a mask if intelligent and polite individual): you don’t come to work at time and don’t give a shit (he never before would use bad words or aggressive language) about it (which is untrue, I came before him and went for coffee on the kitchen); I said: why you tell that to me? I just came from vacation, what’s your problem? He said looking at my colleague: it’s not about you. Yes, I mean it about you (because she overslept once for an hour) 

He’s stressing out of his mind about work when not needed and thinks we should stress out too; thinking he is the only one who does a good job and he is “the only one working”; then wears a mask as if he wasn’t an asshoke before. 

I feel like if I get defensive about it - I make it look bigger than it is or could also respond in a way I may regret. I don’t want to act on emotions, I want to talk like an adult about if something is wrong. Maybe I feel ashamed that my pride doesn’t let me do this, but is it really bad and it’s bad to get defensive? Am I not allowed to feel that way? (I was once like that, stressing out out of my skull and was prideful with colleagues because I tried to manage too many things, I didn’t realise back then that I was basically saying “I’m the only one working here” and they told me “no we’re not helping you anymore” but they came and helped me out in the end. I couldn’t understand them back then. I am now)

I’m a 24-year-old female, and I have a 20-year-old sister who is more like my first daughter to me. We’ve always been best friends and grew even closer after I moved to another city for work. Despite the distance, we’ve always stayed connected through video calls.

I’ve always encouraged her to go out, explore the world, meet people, and make good decisions. She used to use Bumble occasionally and went on coffee dates, but she never really connected with anyone—until she met a guy (20) in November. She started dating him, but by December, her best friend discovered some troubling things about him.

It turned out he had dumped another girl to be with my sister, lied about never being in a relationship, and manipulated her into thinking he was innocent. Worse, we found out he has a sexual harassment case against him. When confronted, he initially claimed it was about money. However, after pressing further, he admitted to the case but said it was fake. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find proof to confirm whether it was true or not. There’s a 50-50 chance my sister is dating someone dangerous.

We explained everything to her, and she broke up with him. However, a week later, she got back together with him, saying she wants to give him another chance. I’m terrified she might get hurt physically. I can’t tell our parents because my father is physically and verbally abusive, and he would end up blaming both of us and grounding her. 

Please share your thoughts on what I can do to handle this situation.

**The Date/Year and Region:** *United States, 1860s*

 

**The American Civil War**

The American Civil War (1861–1865) was a pivotal conflict in United States history, fought between the Union (northern states) and the Confederacy (southern states that seceded) which resulted in the deaths of over 600,000 soldiers. One of the war's primary cause was the contentious issue of slavery which the South supported given their reliance on slaves for its agriculture heavy economy, and the North opposed on moral grounds.

One of the key events during the civil war was President Abraham Lincoln’s issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which declared enslaved people in Confederate-held territories free.

With the Union's industrial strength and larger population, the Union was able to ultimately overpower the Confederacy and the war ended in April 1865 with Confederate General Robert E. Lee's surrender to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.

With the abolition of slavery which is now enshrined in the  13th Amendment, the Civil War has had a profound impact on the American identity and civil rights

 

**The Blockade**

While coffee was a staple in most households before the Civil War, it became a luxury during the war and played a huge role in the morale of soldiers on both sides and was seen as one of the key ingredients needed for victory. As one solider wrote “… nobody can soldier without coffee.” 

However with New Orleans seceding from the Union in April 1861, President Abraham Lincoln declared a blockade to all Confederate states, preventing key supplies from being traded with the South which caused shortage of coffee amongst the Confederate civilians and soldiers.

With the price of coffee in the Confederacy rising from an average of $1.20 a pound in March 1861 up to an average of $196 per pound in February 1865,  the south started experimenting with all forms of vegetables and nuts in the hopes of creating an alternative coffee-like drink. These experimentations were known as ‘Lincoln coffee’. However once the war ended, many Confederate citizens were relieved when the price of coffee returned to normal, and the necessity for substitutions came to an end.  

 

**Beetroot**

One such historical recipe during this period was published in the Daily Chronicle & Sentinel on 25 August 1861, which was newspaper based in the Confederate state of Georgia, and it uses beetroot as the substitute for coffee. While the recipe originally asked for half a cup of the dehydrated beetroot grounds for a gallon of water, the writer followed up just 6 days later on 31 August 1861 clarifying that the recipe is subject to one’s preference and taste as to how strong it should be, and recommended 1 cup of dehydrated beetroot grounds for 1 gallon of water for adults, and half the amount of dehydrated beetroot grounds for children.

  
**Recipe**

 ·         5 - 8 Beetroots

·         2 Cups of water

·         Sugar to taste

·         Cream or Milk to taste



**Steps**

·         Peel your beetroots with a vegetable peeler, and cut the beetroot into cubes that are about twice the size of a coffee bean.

·         Toast the beetroot cubes in an oven at 100 degrees Celcius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit until the beetroots are dehydrated and brown. My oven took around 6 to 8 hours, but as every oven is different you should check in on your beetroot cubes every 15 to 30 minutes to be safe.

·         Take the beetroot cubes out of the oven once they shrunk significantly and are brown and hard.

·         Grind the dehydrated beetroot cubes in a coffee grinder. If you do not have a coffee grinder, you can use a food processor or spice grinder.

·         To make the beetroot coffee, add 1 tablespoon of the ground beetroot and add it to 2 cups of water and heat this over a hot stove. Once this starts to boil, lower the heat and allow the beetroot coffee to simmer for 5 minutes.

·         You can serve this as is while hot. You can also add sugar and cream/milk to taste.

·         While the original recipe said you can settle the coffee with an egg, I chose to avoid this as I did not enjoy how it tasted but feel free to add the egg if you want to. If you do choose to add the egg, temper a small of beaten egg by very slowly adding and mixing the hot beetroot coffee, taking care not to cook or scramble the egg. Next add the tempered egg mixture back to the pot of hot beetroot coffee and mix well.",1,1736265395.0,easyrecipes,0,1.0,False

For that I thank you! Here is my detailed experience getting a bisalp from consult to post op. I included tips for preparing for surgery at the end.


FINDING DOCTOR / CONSULT

I found my doctor through the childfree doctor list. She was located at my normal obgyn office, but I had never met with this particular doctor before. I was able to schedule the consultation about three weeks out from when I called.
My husband came with me to the initial consultation. The appointment only took about 15 minutes. I had put lots of planning into notes, questions, and how I would defend my decision to be sterilized. I realized immediately in this consult that I wouldn’t need to defend myself at all. The doctor was incredible and approved me right away. She thoroughly explained the procedure, how she approaches the surgery, drew me a little diagram of the planned laproscopic incisions, and we discussed recovery expectations. She told me about the ovarian cancer risk reduction. She allowed my husband and I to ask questions and she was very patient and kind. I asked if she could take photos of before and after during my surgery and she said yes. I also asked if she could remove my birth control implant while I was under anesthesia and she said yes. She didn’t question my decision for sterilization at all. She fully trusted me to choose this. She told me the next step would be her surgical scheduler calling me by the end of the week. She sent me home with paperwork (including the diagram she drew, a Q&A form, and a next steps checklist) 


SCHEDULING / INSURANCE

The surgical scheduler called me a few days after the consult, and I was able to schedule the surgery for two and a half months later. The scheduler told me to keep the entire surgery day open, because they will call the day before surgery with the arrival time. I also scheduled a pre-op appointment for two weeks before my surgery during this call.

The scheduler emailed me the next day with detailed pre-surgery instructions, billing and insurance codes, and directions to the surgery center. The scheduler also emailed me a link to complete an online health profile. This consisted of about 50 health questions, and required me to list all my medications, health concerns, past procedures etc. I did it online and it took about 30 minutes. 

The next step was to check with my insurance to confirm the bisalp would be 100% covered. I made sure to ask over email (and chat portal), so that I would have the answer in writing. I sent the insurance company the codes that the scheduler provided me and insurance confirmed in writing that the bisalp would be 100% covered. 


PRE-OP

My pre-op appointment  was two weeks before my surgery date and consisted of taking vitals and blood work. I had to fast for this appointment (nothing to eat or drink after midnight the day prior). I am a fainter, and since I couldn’t eat or drink prior to the blood draw, I fainted. The staff was really nice about it and helped me feel better. After the blood draw, my doctor came in and talked with me, confirmed the bisalp and birth control implant removal, and I signed the surgical consent forms. I also signed a photo consent form for her to take pictures during my surgery. 

A week before surgery, an anesthesia nurse gave me a call to discuss my health profile that I had completed online. She went over my health information and asked a few questions about certain things. She confirmed that I have never had an issue with anesthesia before, and asked if I had any questions. This call only took about 10 minutes. She also went over the pre-surgery instructions. 

The day before surgery I got the call that my arrival time was 8:50am

The night before surgery I was required to do a special shower with Hibiclens soap (purchased at the drug store). I was told to use half the bottle of soap that night, and repeat in the morning with the remaining half. I made sure to put on clean pjs after my shower that night and I used freshly washed bedding. It felt so surreal knowing my surgery was the next day! I was nervous and excited. I felt I was on the precipice of a major life milestone. I was not allowed to eat or drink anything after midnight.


DAY OF SURGERY

The morning of surgery I repeated my Hibiclens shower. I put on clean, loose, comfy clothes, and shoes that were easy to slip on without bending. I removed all my jewelry. No makeup or lotion on my skin. 
I arrived at the surgery center at 8:30am. My husband came with me, and we checked in at the front desk. A nurse came to get me about 10 minutes later and took me and my husband to a small, private pre-op room. Here, I changed into a gown, socks, and hair cap. They gave me a bag to put my clothes and personal belongings in and put it in a locker for me. My pre-op room had a comfy reclining chair. A nurse came and showed me to the bathroom across the hall to collect a urine sample (for pregnancy test). I went back to my pre-op room and the nurse inserted my IV. My husband was still with me and he held my other hand as she inserted the IV. Thankfully, it was fast and didn’t hurt, and I didn’t feel faint. I had a mild burning sensation in my hand where the IV was until they started a saline drip. The burning subsided quickly. The nurse gave me a pill for preventing nausea. I was in this pre-op room in my chair for a little over an hour. During this time, my surgeon, anesthesiologist, and the OR nurses came to talk to me one by one. My surgeon came in with a purple marker and labeled my skin at the surgery site. The anesthesiologist came in and explained how the anesthesia would be administered through my IV, talked about intubation, and asked me some more questions about my health. He looked down my throat with a flashlight. The  two OR nurses came in and dismissed my husband to the waiting room. They walked with me, arm in arm, directly into the OR. I was a little nervous at this point and these nurses holding my arms and walking by my sides was such a comfort. 
The OR was bright and clean, with the operating table in the middle of the room surrounded by monitors and machines. The nurses positioned me on the table with my arms lying outward like a cross. There were about 10 people in the room bustling around, getting everything ready. It was slightly overwhelming but everyone was really kind. They put an oxygen mask over my face and had me breathe deeply while the anesthesia was put in my IV. After about 10 seconds I began to feel a little dizzy (not like fainting, it felt more like the spins from alcohol) but it wasn’t painful or scary. It was peaceful. The next thing I knew I woke up in a recovery bed. (The surgery only took about 40 minutes total). 

The recovery bed I first woke up in was in a small alcove in a hallway. My first memory after waking up was saying to the nurse that I missed my husband. This nurse was bubbly and very chatty, and asked me if I felt any pain. As I became more awake I did feel sore in my abdomen (mild cramps) and one of my incisions was burning slightly. I told the nurse this, and she put a dose of fentanyl through my IV. I almost immediately felt better (but it made my face itchy). Once my pain was under control, she transferred me to a wheeling bed and moved me to a private recovery room. The recovery room looked exactly like my pre-op room, with a comfy reclining chair and privacy curtain. This is where they brought my husband back to see me. The nurses gently moved me into the chair, and brought me apple juice and crackers. I was still groggy so my memory of this is a little hazy. My surgeon came to the recovery room to report that the surgery had gone perfectly, and she asked me how I was feeling. I remember crying a little as I spoke to her. I think I was emotional from the anesthesia. I gave her a thank you card I had written. I stayed in this recovery room for about an hour. It was required that I pee before leaving.  At first I felt no urge to pee, so one of the recovery nurses brought me a warm cup of coffee. She was so sweet to me and said the warmth of the coffee would trigger the need to pee and she was right! She then walked me to the bathroom across the hall. She went in the bathroom  with me and helped me sit on the toilet. She stepped out of the room while I peed. I rang a little bell when I was done for her to reenter. She helped me wash my hands and then walked me back to my recovery room. I stayed another 20 minutes or so. My pain was returning (still very minimal) so they gave me one pill of oxy which took about 10 minutes to kick in. I felt great after that! Another nurse came in and went over the at home instructions and medication instructions (they did not order prescription meds for me, I was told to alternate tylenol and ibuprofen) She gave me papers with written instructions to take home. My husband got my clothes from my locker, and helped me get dressed. The nurse asked if I could walk to my car, but I opted to be wheeled out. My husband pulled our car around out front and a nurse wheeled me to my car. We drove home! I put a pillow between the seatbelt and my stomach which was very helpful. 


RECOVERY

My recovery was very smooth. Please keep in mind that recovery will be different for every body. I began taking stool softeners and gas x when I got home from surgery. These were a life saver for me, but please consult your doctor. 

DAY ONE (DAY OF SURGERY)

* Incision pain was 3/10 (slight burning), cramps 3/10, gas shoulder pain and pain under ribs was 4/10 (more uncomfortable than painful)

* Soreness increased towards the evening as fentanyl/oxy meds wore off. 

* I Rotated Tylenol and ibuprofen which mostly helped. Heating pads helped my shoulder pain tremendously! 

* I was able to sleep on my side with no increased pain. 

* Mild burning when peeing (tolerable).

* Mild vaginal bleeding

DAY 2

* Woke up very sore (felt like intense ab workout) but had very little shoulder/rib pain. 

* No incision pain except occasionally when sitting up or twisting. 

* Soreness/bloating when walking around was 4/10. I was only able to walk back and forth to the bathroom. 

* Mild vaginal bleeding. 

DAY 3

* No incision pain, no shoulder/rib pain. 

* I had soreness when moving or changing positions/walking. 

* I was still pretty bloated which was uncomfortable. 

* Mild vaginal bleeding. 

DAY 4

* I had heavier, period-like bleeding. (Keep in mind I also had my birth control removed so this may not be from the bisalp alone)  

* I finally pooped this day and I’m not going to lie, it hurt a lot and had some blood in it. 

* I showered this day (I was allowed to shower after 24 hrs but I chose to wait because standing was uncomfortable)

* No shoulder pain, no incision pain unless twisting or bending. 

* I was still very bloated. 

DAY 5

* Soreness when standing or walking 

* My Incisions were itchy (from the glue)

* Still slightly bloated. 

* No bleeding 

DAY 6

* Sore when bending, standing, walking. No other pain! 

* Less bloated

* No bleeding

DAY 7

* I felt pretty good! Occasional soreness, especially when standing, walking, or bending. 

* No longer bloated. No bleeding. 

* Incisions still had glue on them. 

I was able to take a week off work for recovery, which I definitely needed. It took me about two full weeks to feel back to normal. The first full week I only ventured to walk around my house or my yard. I did not bounce back in a day or two like some others do, and that’s okay. Listen to your body! It will tell you what to do.


POST-OP

I had a post-op appointment two weeks after surgery. This was a short appointment during which my surgeon asked how I felt, checked my incision healing progress, and she cleared me to resume all normal activity (including sex and weight lifting). She told me to resume life as normal, and simply listen to my body. She said if I felt sore after an activity, that was my body telling me I had overdone it. 


SURGERY PREP / TIPS

* I stopped drinking alcohol a month before surgery. This was not directed by my doctor but was my preference so I could feel my healthiest.

* consider outfits for returning to work/life after the first few days of recovery. I found jeans/leggings/any fitted pants painful to wear for the first two weeks. I wore loose flowy linen pants, or anything that didn’t squeeze or rub my stomach. 

* I meal prepped several soups and froze them for easy to eat, healthy meals for post surgery 

* I compiled a basket of supplies to have next to my bed for easy access. I put Tylenol and Ibuprofen, Gas X, stool softener, a barf bag (thankfully didn’t need this), tums, cough drops, chap stick, bandaids, and my post surgery instructions in the basket. 

* I bought menstrual pads and disposable underwear/diaper with pads. The disposable underwear was perfect for my post surgery bleeding especially overnight

* I deep cleaned my bedroom prior to surgery. Having a clean space to recover in helped me feel better 

* I washed all my pjs and all my bedding prior to surgery 

* I arranged pet care for the day of surgery, since I didn’t know how long we would be at the surgery center

* this one is weird but was SO helpful. Clip your toenails before surgery!! It may be hard to bend over to do that for a while, so do that while you can! 

* I packed a small bag to have in the car after my surgery that had a pillow (to put between the seatbelt and my stomach), an apple juice, and some pretzels for the ride home. 

* I made sure to buy lots of fresh fruits, fresh veggies, apple juice (no added sugar), cranberry juice (no added sugar), ginger ale, and tea (peppermint tea helped with bloating) for post surgery meals

* I made sure I had a good book to read during recovery 

* I gathered heating pads and had them next to my bed

* I didn’t tell any family about my surgery (nor will I ever). I only told my husband and a few very trusted friends. I told my boss I needed time off for “abdominal surgery” but I did not give any further details nor did he inquire. 


INCISION HEALING PROGRESS

I am now several months post surgery. I feel 100% back to normal. My belly button incision is invisible. I have two incisions on my right side (one by my hip bone and one on my stomach) these two incisions are dark pink (quite visible against my pale skin) but my doctor said they should be nearly invisible by a year. My two visible incisions are both so small, about the width of a fingernail. 


FINAL THOUGHTS

I am so thankful I had the opportunity and resources to get sterilized. I feel relief, security, and freedom having had my bisalp. It was one of the best decisions I ever made.

If you made it this far, thank you! I’m happy to answer any questions you may have! 

Don’t let fear stop you from pursuing a bisalp. It’s normal to feel anxiety or apprehension even if you know it’s the right choice. Follow your instincts, trust yourself, and do it scared ❤️ ",3,1736265271.0,sterilization,0,1.0,False

Looking for someone I can talk to right now, especially if you’ve got a lot of problems too—so we can relate! Hoping you’re working, 24 and up, sponty, and based around Metro Manila, so we can easily meet up for coffee. 

About me: I’m a hyper-independent woman who knows what she wants in life. I’m a working professional, a good listener, a singer, a lover of photography, and an R&B girl at heart, a retired lover girl, an animal lover, and currently looking for new hobbies in life. 

Please, please, no indecent messages! I’ve had too many people message me here before with nothing but inappropriate stuff.

DM me your ASL and a short intro, friend! 👍",3,1736265196.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False

Copper Cup - environment feels like I am at a prison - whats with those terrible cement light fixtures?, not diverse - mostly young white females working there, coffee okay, good place to maybe meet young singles? Good for working

New Holland Coffee Co - Not a fan of the trendy barn, I-bought-this-decor-at-Hobby-Lobby interior, feels very white evangelical, I love coffee&Jesus but not social justice, Lancaster county typical, internet did not work for me, later hours which is nice, don’t remember the coffee, have not been back

I finished my cup of coffee…empty.  Remember how you used to tell me to swirl the last remnants around and then we’d try and figure out what it looked like?  Kind of like staring into the clouds, you told me.  I swirled and swirled…empty.  Drops of flat coffee with no flavor, no meaning.

My colleague loves to anticipate the most so she can leave earlier. She do all the job well, but for me, she do it too early and sometimes it doesnt seem logical or it could just tell the customers that we are already closing the bar, even if we're not.

For example, she clean all of the bar mats we use to put the beverages for the waiters, those that we use to protect the wood of the bar when we're preparing custom coffees etc.

Why cleaning it too early if you probably gonna drop something into it a little later ?

She told me that when she waits for the bar mats, she just move to the cocktail station to make custom coffees etc but for me its like deleting a certain part of the bar just because there's no carpets to protect it because she wasshes it too early.

I like the idea of anticipation because we can leave a bit earlier but its a bit too much no ?

Im asking your advices today because we're creating a checklist for all the new barmans because our bar is so clean and well organized, that we really want that every barman/barmaid keep it like this.

There is a girl I met a few years ago at a professional event. I’m 32 M she’s 23 F. We were both in relationships at the time, but during those three days, we talked a lot, we liked each other, and we even kissed. Interestingly, neither of us knew the other person was in a relationship. We live a few hours apart, so after the event, things became uncertain. We met once more afterward, and it was very intense, but we didn’t have sex. Since then, the connection has been interrupted a few times, but life brought us back together, and we met 2-3 more times. We exchanged many messages while we were with our partners, and at one point, she got caught, so she broke off the connection. However, this year, she intentionally showed up at the event where she knew I’d be. There was no kiss, but she hugged me, invited me for coffee, and the chemistry between us was very hot. After the last event, I thought about reaching out to her again. We exchanged a few emails, which were long and witty, but sometimes it took a week or two for her to respond. I’m still with my partner, but she has had several relationships since then, yet she always seems to maintain an interest in me. Maybe she’s always been waiting for me to make a move and leave my partner.

I know the right decision would be to cut off contact with her, because I think about her a lot. The chemistry between us is incredibly strong, and it’s interesting that no matter how much time passes, we continue the conversation as if we just left off yesterday. That’s rare.

My question is: why is this relationship good for her, if she is also in a relationship? Why does she write detailed emails, but then take two weeks to reply? Why does she seek my company when we’re close, even though we haven’t talked in a long time? Is she just playing with me? Does she enjoy the positive reinforcement? Does it feel good for her to think she can seduce someone?",0,1736264748.0,cheating_stories,0,0.25,False

Dental veneers have revolutionized cosmetic dentistry, offering people a chance to transform their smiles with stunning, perfect-looking teeth. But for many patients, a critical question lingers: can teeth veneers be whitened? Unlike natural teeth, veneers have unique properties that make traditional whitening methods challenging. Understanding the complexities of veneer maintenance and brightness is crucial for anyone considering or currently sporting these popular cosmetic dental solutions. click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

What Are Dental Veneers?

Dental veneers are thin, custom-made shells of tooth-colored materials designed to cover the front surface of teeth. They are typically made from two primary materials:

1. Porcelain veneers
2. Composite resin veneers

Each material has distinct characteristics that impact their whitening potential. Porcelain veneers, in particular, are known for their stain-resistant properties and natural-looking appearance.

Why Traditional Whitening Methods Don't Work on Veneers

**Porcelain and composite veneers are non-porous**, which means traditional teeth whitening treatments cannot penetrate their surface. Typical whitening agents like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide work by entering the tooth's enamel and breaking down stains - a process impossible with veneers. click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Strategies for Maintaining Veneer Brightness

While you cannot technically ""whiten"" existing veneers, several strategies can help maintain their original brightness:

- Professional cleaning by a dental hygienist
- Using non-abrasive whitening toothpaste
- Avoiding staining substances like coffee and red wine
- Regular dental check-ups

Replacement vs. Whitening: What's the Best Option?

When veneers become discolored or stained, dental professionals typically recommend replacement rather than attempting to whiten them. The reasons include:

1. Irreversible nature of veneer materials
2. Risk of damaging veneer surface
3. Potential for uneven coloration

Factors Affecting Veneer Discoloration

Several factors can impact veneer appearance over time:

- Age of the veneers
- Quality of original installation
- Personal oral hygiene habits
- Dietary choices
- Smoking

Professional Solutions for Veneer Brightness

Dentists can offer professional solutions when veneers lose their original luster:

**Professional Polishing**: Specialized dental tools can restore some of the original shine.

**Veneer Replacement**: The most effective method for achieving a bright, uniform smile.

**Color Matching**: Ensuring new veneers blend seamlessly with surrounding teeth.

Preventative Care for Long-Lasting Veneers

To maximize veneer longevity and maintain their brightness:

- Brush twice daily with non-abrasive toothpaste
- Floss regularly
- Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
- Avoid excessive pressure when brushing

Cost Considerations for Veneer Maintenance

The cost of maintaining or replacing veneers can vary:

- Professional cleaning: $75-$200
- Veneer replacement: $925-$2,500 per tooth
- Dental polishing: $50-$350

When to Consult a Dental Professional

If you notice significant discoloration or changes in your veneers, scheduling a consultation with a cosmetic dentist is recommended. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific veneer type and condition.

Conclusion

Understanding that teeth veneers cannot be traditionally whitened is crucial for managing expectations and maintaining dental aesthetics. While you cannot use standard whitening treatments, professional cleaning, careful maintenance, and potential replacement offer effective solutions for preserving your beautiful smile. Consulting with a qualified dental professional remains the best approach to addressing any concerns about veneer brightness and longevity.",1,1736264729.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

I’m early 40’s F never married no kids living in a major metropolitan city, and finding dating to be challenging recently. Two early connections I was excited about didn’t progress and I can’t tell if I’m being too impatient or if I’m dodging bullets. I do wholeheartedly believe if these were the right people for me, none of this would matter but I want to make sure I’m being realistic and understanding of people in general to have more success in finding compatibility.

First guy (late 30s) I matched with in late summer and we were both traveling a bit, and messaging consistently and having fun getting to know each other. Typically if the guy hasn’t suggested a meet in a week or so, I’ll casually suggest something. This guy wouldn’t nail anything down, and cancelled the day of we were supposed to grab wine saying he was tired and could we postpone for the following week (no date/time/place suggested) as he’s out of town again. I politely refused as we’d been speaking for 2.5 weeks already, and his effort and excuse felt lukewarm.

Second guy (mid 40s) matched in Nov. Immediately a strong connection. He was open, warm, intelligent- he traveled quite a bit and I could tell he was a busy person. To me that is fine. However, his initial openness turned a bit cagey, but he was making an effort to call/video chat which was really fun. Text replies were intermittent but consistent- sometimes immediate, other times 12-48 hours. We had a quick coffee date before we were both traveling for the holidays. We messaged a bit after, then he ghosted for almost two weeks. When he came back around super casual, I expressed my need for consistency and he slinked away saying his travel is too crazy.

I find these situations as an indication of no real interest and limited clarity in communication. However a friend says that hes much more easy going in the early stages when you don’t know someone, and laid back about coordinating schedules/dates as our lives are busier and diverge from a set path as we get older.

So how easy going and understanding are you about scheduling/effort in early stage meet ups? Has that been successful for you? thanks everyone!",1,1736264332.0,datingoverforty,2,1.0,False
1hvu49w,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1hvu49w/did_i_make_a_mistake/,Did I make a mistake?,"I was recently let go from a small restaurant I was working out, a “hip” vegan place.

That morning I came into open and set everything up. I had about 10 minutes before opening and all that was left was to place the ladles in the containers on the line, so I stepped out of the kitchen to make myself a cup of coffee.

Now, we had the coffee we served patrons but there was also another whole bean coffee that I personally preferred-both were available for employees.

So I load the coffee into the grinder and a shit ton of coffee comes out, way more than I anticipated. For some reason the FOH staff pre-loaded the grinder with beans in anticipation of an order (we made coffee to order)

The coffee grounds went everywhere and made a huge mess and I had to clean it up.

Because it took so long my manager came out and asked what was going on, why wasn’t in the kitchen, why weren’t the ladles set etc.

I tried explaining but it was clear it didn’t matter the reasoning. 

So, it’s a minute to two past opening, I go back to finish setting up the ladles and that’s that.

My coworker asks if I want coffee and I was just too upset by the whole situation so I said no. I figured caffeine wouldn’t be good on top of the stress of the situation. 

A minute later she asks me again and I said no.

Again she asks me and I was pretty bothered by being asked a third time and I had a bit of an attitude but I said “no” again.

About 10 minutes later my manager takes me in to the office and hands me a write-up for “cussing out” my coworker. Apparently that same coworker told her I cussed at her bc she offered me to make me coffee.

Which wasn’t true. So I got in trouble for not signing the write-up

They sent me home and I got an email from the owner letting me go “for my behavior”. 

I don’t know the word for it but it’s absurd to me that someone can lie and I have no recourse, and it’s made out as if I’m the problematic one when other people are the problematic one

Anyways- I know I didn’t fuck up by cussing because I didn’t do that

But i want to know- did I fuck up by not putting the ladles out?

In my mind, this task was going to take 3 minutes and it ended up taking 10. We never get customers as soon as we open, the first hour is usually dead, so I didn’t feel at risk of being unprepared on the line.

1hvu1w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1hvu1w1/currently_quitting_smoking/,Currently quitting smoking,"I haven't failed to smoke a cigarette every single day for over the last 18 years, that is until December 31st last year (8 days ago). 

My husband and I have tried to quit so many times and we've never made it 12 hours without goading or triggering eachother into going out and buying some. We were both incredibly reliant on nicotine, or so I thought. 

I'd love to share my experience and hope it helps someone, anyone that felt just as helpless as I did for quitting. 

Firstly you really have to want to quit, for yourself not because someone else wants you to. NRTs (nicotine replacement therapy) is actually why I got as far as I did but it wasn't until two days ago I realized it wasn't necessarily the nicotine I wanted. I was using nicotine lozenges to curb the fits when they would come up, now these lozenges are 4mg (about 3 cigarettes) worth of nicotine and.. even for someone who smoked a pack a day a 4mg tab that sits in your cheek to slowly dissolve was still far more than my body could handle. These damn things made me feel sick every time I used one, I started cutting them in half to the same result, nausea. I began cutting them in 4th pieces and that seemed to do the trick.. 

Now I'm going to try to explain this to the best of my ability without sounding absolutely insane - when we quit smoking, after a few days it felt like something was missing. The best and only way I can articulate this is that it feels like my best friend has come up to the door outside, I know they are right outside but I can't open it. It's a feeling of not being able to fulfill a silly, simple urge that makes the want of a cigarette so damn strong. It's the repetition of the last 18 years waking up and going outside to smoke after you start the coffee pot, the reward of smoking after every single task you complete. You've made yourself a ritualistic smoker, and even now that you're quitting, you have told yourself it's time to go smoke in your head 15 times since you woke up. 

It's been essentially a week, I don't get annoyed when I catch myself thinking about going out to smoke anymore but rather I find it absolutely disgusting about how many things I rewarded myself with a cigarette.

If you are currently quitting or plan to, I can't stress enough how damn hard the first few days are. The nicotine lozenges are the only reason I got past it, the hardest part is getting your brain to understand you won't be stepping outside every 45min to an hour anymore. It didn't take a health scare, cost of cigarettes or anything of the sort for me to quit and it was almost purely on a whim from a amazon gift for Christmas, that I wanted to try nicotine lozenges as an alternative to maybe quit smoking.

Think of me as the charmingly unhinged mix of Jane Austen, Plato, and a stand-up comic who forgot their punchlines but made you laugh anyway. My life revolves around literature, theology, and philosophy because apparently, I thought, Why not overthink everything while also sounding pretentious? Spoiler alert: it’s both rewarding and exhausting. My brain is powered by a potent mix of ideas, existential crises, and just enough caffeine to keep me teetering on the edge of enlightenment - or a nervous breakdown, depending on the day.

I’ve been writing letters since I was six—mostly to my grandmother, who deserves sainthood for reading them. Once, I tried to mail her a postcard *sans* stamp. (Spoiler: the post office isn’t a fan of free-spirited creativity.) Over the years, I’ve grown into a slightly more polished writer but with the same childlike enthusiasm.

I’ve had the privilege of forging some amazing connections, most of which I’ve had to let go. Not for dramatic reasons, mind you - just your garden-variety “it’s not you, it’s me” scenarios. Lately, I’ve been toying with the idea of picking up the pen again, but procrastination is my middle name. Today, however, I finally decided to make good on that thought.I’m absolutely thrilled to meet you, well, not “meet” in the literal sense because, you know, letters...but close enough! And if you feel inspired to write back, I’ll be so grateful I might even send you a postcard. Don’t worry, this time I’ll remember the stamp. Probably.

When I’m not passionately arguing with myself about the meaning of life (or why tea will forever outclass coffee), you’ll find me in the kitchen, experimenting like a mad scientist who traded test tubes for spatulas. Sometimes it’s a culinary masterpiece; other times, even my dog looks concerned.

Rainy days are my love language. Give me a cup of tea, a slightly obscure book that makes me question my existence, and the sound of raindrops, and I’m in heaven. Bonus points if I can curl up in a blanket and pretend the outside world doesn’t exist. Bliss. But don’t worry, I’m not just a brooding intellectual; I’m also surprisingly fun. Like, “philosophical debates over pizza and bad puns” kind of fun.

I’m all about connecting with people, especially those who can tolerate my quirky humor and occasional deep dives into why we’re all here (or why pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity). Fair warning: I laugh way too hard at my own jokes and will absolutely judge your food seasoning skills.

In a nutshell, I’m equal parts thinker and clown, with a dash of culinary chaos. My DMs are open, so slide in like a confident penguin on ice.

This review details my trip to Shetland during the winter season, and is specifically targeted towards individuals who would like to visit this gorgeous place on a budget as this is how I travelled over there.

### Transport

To get to Shetland island, you can get there by plane or by ferry. I chose ferry because it is much much cheaper than taking the plane though you have to endure a 12 hour long ferry journey.

The ferry was clean and great. I only paid for the ticket and did not pay anything extra like seats or rooms. Usually people book seats or rooms so that they can have comfortable night on the ferry, but I didn't need to because I was able to find a comfortable spot at the lounge to lie down and sleep. I assume if you go during the summer period, it will be hard to find said spot as it will be crowded, but I went during the winter period so there isn't much people onboard.

The food onboard was good and really affordable too. I think it was £11 for fish and chips. You could also buy your own food and bring it onboard if you do not wish to dine there.

During winter, the ferry ride did get really bumpy and I did get seasick multiple times (and I don't usually get motion sickness easily). My advice would be to purchase motion sickness medicine or during the bumpy part of the ferry, lie down and shut your eyes.

On Shetland itself, I took only the bus and walked the remaining distances. In theory, you could get anywhere via bus. However, when I was there, it was really challenging. Firstly, if you have never been to the place, you will have no idea which bus stop you are at when you are looking through the Shetland Bus app. Secondly, during winter, the weather is more extreme which resulted in more disruptions so you have to change your plans frequently. I remember constantly contacting the Shetland bus helpline to check if there are any disruptions for the route I am taking that day. Lastly, the buses may not serve every location and the frequency of the buses can be low (about one every one-two hours). This means cutting short ur trip at the place to meet the bus timing or be willing to wait for a couple of hours.

There were a couple of times I couldn't find a bus or the bus stop so I had to rely on the kindness of the Shetland people for help. They are the nicest bunch of people. Some guided me to the bus stop, some drove me to the bus stop, and some even allowed me to hitch a ride with them to the location I am heading to.

I once asked her if I could try Reestit Mutton Soup here (a local delicacy) and she went to ask a couple of restaurants and cafe for me. Though, there weren't any shops selling them at the moment. On my check-out day, my ferry was delayed by a couple of hours, and she was so kind to let me stay in the lounge till its time to board the ferry. Also, while waiting for the ferry, she even served me chicken soup and bread. It was lovely.

If you are coming up during the Up Helly Aa festival, I would recommend staying at her place because her location is just right beside the town hall, where the partying happens, and she claims to be able to get tickets for all her guests.

The room was clean and comfortable. She also provided breakfast in a basket for me and were very generous with the portion. As someone travelling on the budget, I had relied on the breakfast for both my breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is possible!

The accommodation's location is great too. It is about a 1 mile walk from the ferry terminal, though u can take a bus to shorten the walking distance. Also, there is a Tesco supermarket less than 1 mile away from the location which is great when you want to have some proper food instead of relying on the breakfast. I bought a meal, snack and drink combo which only cost £4!

### Trip

#### Day 1

When I first arrived, my accommodation host was great to allow me to do an early check-in at not extra charge. Otherwise I would have to suffer in the cold when no other shops are open!

I initally wanted to go to Hillswick for a hike on day 1 (more on that later) but since I took some time to check-in, it has already gotten quite late. On google maps, it states that it takes an hour to head up there, and another hour back. The hike would probably take two hours. So if i did head up there, I would have had more trouble returning before the sunsets, which isn't ideal considering the extreme weather, more people staying indoors and frequency of buses decreasing as it approaches sunset timing.

Instead I went to Clickimin broch to have a look and took some pictures, then went back. It was a chill day.

#### Day 2

This time I woke up early and head to St. Ninian Isles. It is very scenic location and the views are just stunning. However, I did not cross to the St. Ninian Isles because apparently on that day high tide is at 1pm and when I was there, the waves are already covering the middle part of the tombolo. This means if I cross it, I will get wet! I would rather stay dry than wet in this very chilly weather.

While I was there in the nearby town of Bigton, I somehow ended up at the Bigton weekend event which is held in an old church building (if you ask anyone at Bigton, they will know where it is). The people there are lovely. There is also a guy who mades bread for the town and sells it every weekend at the event. I had a croissant and it was really good. There was also coffee and a shop that sells second hand goods.

#### Day 3

On day 3, I wanted to go to Hillswick or Eshaness (they are relatively closeby). However, I decided not to go after seeking advice from the kind folks in shetland because snow was covering the place and it is definitely not ideal for cliff walk, considering that snow would cover any holes or cliff edges, increasing your risk of injury.

Instead, I went to Sumburgh Head and hiked there. I also got to see some of the old settlements which was great. The hike can be slightly challenging as the slopes can be steep and it is very muddy and wet. Though if you walk carefully, you would not get very muddy and wet. But I was rewarded with a fantastic view and even went to see the Sumburgh lighthouse. Be warned though that the weather can changed very quickly while you are hiking, but it is worth it because nothing beats the amazing view.

#### Day 4

Did not do anything today because I was recovering from the hike from the previous day. Also, I wanted to try Frankie's Fish and Chips (apparently the best and most northern Fish and Chips in the UK) but it was closed. I also wanted to try Reestit Mutton Soup at Peerie Shop Cafe, but it was only available on Wednesdays.

One problem I’ve always had and struggle with is sleeping in till 3-4 pm and then 2 hours after needing a nap on my day off. On the days I work, I make sure I get my usual 8-9hrs of sleep and wake up at 9:40am. I’m severely fatigued throughout the day and cannot function without a nap when I don’t have any caffeine and when I do have some coffee it helps a bit but I’ll still crash shortly after. This problem of being really tired started 2018 which so happen to be the time where all my depression symptoms started but at that time I had no idea what it was. I just brush it off as senioritis until I started college and realized this plus anxiety was a real problem in my life. I usually work on my hobbies or try to be productive on my day off. I even plan things to do but never get to them because I’m struggling to get out of bed. I try to talk myself into getting out of bed and doing something but I’m just not very convinced. I don’t know if it’s anxiety or what but any one has any advice? It’s painful knowing that I’ve spent my entire day on the bed.

Though it won a prize in their region, if I'm honest, I think the coffee is still not great, though obviously I appreciate the thought.

I've used all kinds of roasts and mainly always come out with something I really enjoy drinking. But these beans are very dark, much darker than anything I've brewed espresso with before, and don't have much in the way of aroma. 

I've struggled to dial it in, while sticking to a 18g dose and a 1:1.5 ratio, even very small adjustments in grind size resulted in going from very fast extraction (27g in 15s) to very slow (27g in 45+s). Even the very fast extraction tasted overly bitter and quite unpleasant, and didn't seem under extracted at all.

I've switched to 17g, and suddenly I'm getting 25.5g in 35s, and though I don't love the taste, it's a definite improvement. 

I know ultimately you can only do so much to glaze over what is not a great coffee, but just wondered whether anyone had any tips on dialing in lesser quality beans/roasts, or if anyone shares my hypothesis that decreasing the size of the dose is the way to go?",1,1736263262.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

This review details my trip to Shetland during the winter season, and is specifically targeted towards individuals who would like to visit this gorgeous place on a budget as this is how I travelled over there.

### Transport
To get to Shetland island, you can get there by plane or by ferry. I chose ferry because it is much much cheaper than taking the plane though you have to endure a 12 hour long ferry journey.

The ferry was clean and great. I only paid for the ticket and did not pay anything extra like seats or rooms. Usually people book seats or rooms so that they can have comfortable night on the ferry, but I didn't need to because I was able to find a comfortable spot at the lounge to lie down and sleep. I assume if you go during the summer period, it will be hard to find said spot as it will be crowded, but I went during the winter period so there isn't much people onboard.

The food onboard was good and really affordable too. I think it was £11 for fish and chips. You could also buy your own food and bring it onboard if you do not wish to dine there.

During winter, the ferry ride did get really bumpy and I did get seasick multiple times (and I don't usually get motion sickness easily). My advice would be to purchase motion sickness medicine or during the bumpy part of the ferry, lie down and shut your eyes.

On Shetland itself, I took only the bus and walked the remaining distances. In theory, you could get anywhere via bus. However, when I was there, it was really challenging. Firstly, if you have never been to the place, you will have no idea which bus stop you are at when you are looking through the Shetland Bus app. Secondly, during winter, the weather is more extreme which resulted in more disruptions so you have to change your plans frequently. I remember constantly contacting the Shetland bus helpline to check if there are any disruptions for the route I am taking that day. Lastly, the buses may not serve every location and the frequency of the buses can be low (about one every one-two hours). This means cutting short ur trip at the place to meet the bus timing or be willing to wait for a couple of hours.

There were a couple of times I couldn't find a bus or the bus stop so I had to rely on the kindness of the Shetland people for help. They are the nicest bunch of people. Some guided me to the bus stop, some drove me to the bus stop, and some even allowed me to hitch a ride with them to the location I am heading to.

### Accommodation
I stayed at this [place](https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/ald-norlande.html?aid=304142&label=gen173bo-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gDaFCIAQGYATG4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQOIAgGYAiGoAgO4As3r6rsGwAIB0gIkMzVlMDYzMzUtMGY0NC00OWZiLWFkMWYtYWFlZTlmMjI4ZDZi2AIF4AIB&sid=5ca33fbc474ff84e3102b30bdc2f9100&all_sr_blocks=175135002_90671793_2_2_0&checkin=2025-01-05&checkout=2025-01-06&dest_id=-2601024&dest_type=city&dist=0&group_adults=2&group_children=0&hapos=2&highlighted_blocks=175135002_90671793_2_2_0&hpos=2&matching_block_id=175135002_90671793_2_2_0&no_rooms=1&req_adults=2&req_children=0&room1=A%2CA&sb_price_type=total&sr_order=popularity&sr_pri_blocks=175135002_90671793_2_2_0__10000&srepoch=1736095258&srpvid=d596754bb74918e9&type=total&ucfs=1&). The host is a lovely person and will do all she can to make it a wonderful stay for you.

I’m 32 now, she’s 23. We were both in relationships at the time, but during those three days, we talked a lot, we liked each other, and we even kissed. Interestingly, neither of us knew the other person was in a relationship. We live a few hours apart, so after the event, things became uncertain. We met once more afterward, and it was very intense, but we didn’t have sex. Since then, the connection has been interrupted a few times, but life brought us back together, and we met 2-3 more times. We exchanged many messages while we were with our partners, and at one point, she got caught, so she broke off the connection. However, this year, she intentionally showed up at the event where she knew I’d be. There was no kiss, but she hugged me, invited me for coffee, and the chemistry between us was very hot. After the last event, I thought about reaching out to her again. We exchanged a few emails, which were long and witty, but sometimes it took a week or two for her to respond. I’m still with my partner, but she has had several relationships since then, yet she always seems to maintain an interest in me. Maybe she’s always been waiting for me to make a move and leave my partner.

I know the right decision would be to cut off contact with her, because I think about her a lot. The chemistry between us is incredibly strong, and it’s interesting that no matter how much time passes, we continue the conversation as if we just left off yesterday. That’s rare.

My question is: why is this relationship good for her, if she is also in a relationship? Why does she write detailed emails, but then take two weeks to reply? Why does she seek my company when we’re close, even though we haven’t talked in a long time? Is she just playing with me? Does she enjoy the positive reinforcement?

My ex and I have been broken up for almost 4 months now. We decided to go NC from the beginning and only broke it on Christmas because she (my ex) texted me ""Merry Christmas"" and ""Are you down to get a coffee together?"". I decided to call her and very calmly explained to her that I had no interest in getting back together and most of all, I would have rather kept our NC deal in the forseeable future.   
Now, this took a lot of strenght on my part because I had been SO co-dependent on her in the past and breaking up was a mutual decision we took because we knew our dynamic was toxic, but it really took a toll on my mental stability.  
She wasn't happy, but said she understood where I was coming from.  
Fast forward a week: she blocked me on Spotify. I was like ""ok, maybe she'd rather not have me see the music she is playing, or maybe she just doesn't want to have a connection through music"".   
Fast forward another week: she UNblocked me on Spotify. That made me lol, but I assumed she had changed her mind.   
Fast forward 2 days: she blocked me on whatsapp (the app we used to communicate).   
Now I'm really wondering: what on earth is this woman doing? I NEVER texted her in the 4 months of NC so far, and had 0 plans to do so.   
I am really really doing my best to keep everything civil, mature and as low-key as possible. I am left to wonder what these behaviours mean. I wish we could remain as civil as possible and blocking one another seems so unnecessary since we have already unadded each other on every social media platform.   
I'm not worried or anything, just bitterly amused at the turn of events this breakup is having 4 months in.   
Has anything similar ever happened to you?

We love our morning meals, be it sweets at a bakery or something savory. And we enjoy great coffee and drinking chocolate. So let me ask:

1. Are there any bakeries or cafes you'd recommend in (or within walking distance of) Polanco? This would be for morning, either super-early if jet-lag or until about 9am.

2. Alternatively, any destination-worthy bakery or coffee-shop/cafe to which you'd say we should make the pilgrimage?

For context, I dashed to Rosetta as a detour just in time to catch my plane with pastries and bread in hand for my flight home last time, so I'd be interested in anything as good as Rosetta or better.

Another case involving a trip to an alleged alien base is recounted by Jorge Martín. In 1980 Iván Rivera Morales, a Puerto Rican police officer, lay bed- ridden with rheumatic fever. Racked with pain and unable to move, he prayed for a cure. **Some nights later, the room filled with golden spheres of light**. A voice in his head told him not to be afraid, **and the spheres materialized into two four-foot-high beings – the typical ‘greys’**. Suddenly, as in the case of Carl Higdon (Chapter 15), Morales found himself inside a bizarre, transparent contraption, standing up beside the beings, who placed a helmet on his head, supposedly to facilitate communication.

In Chapter 1, I refer in part to the story of Inocencia Cataquet, who claims to have encountered undersea alien craft in Puerto Rico in 1988. Cataquet told Jorge Martín that he subseqently communicated with human-type aliens who, as in the case of Iván Rivera Morales (Chapter 17), **seemed to ‘materialize’ out of balls of light. They explained to Cataquet that they were capable of travelling among dimensions.** Impending ‘geological changes’ will endanger all life on Earth, they declared, necessitating their taking and preserving the genetics of all species – including humankind – with which to repopulate Earth in the event of global catastrophe.

On the evening of December 22, 1977, Vega was at his home caring for his wife, who was feeling ill and had been vomiting all night due to a flu-like illness.

Vega decided to go outside to the terrace and clean out the bowl his wife had been using. As he washed the bowl, **he saw three bright lights approaching**. He first thought they were fireflies until they grew close and he saw that they were large and bright. He fell to his knees and watched in fear **as the lights descended onto the terrace right in front of him and transformed into three men.**

They were ""not ugly or pretty,"" said Vega. They were three feet tall, with short arms and legs and large hands. Their faces were large, with a big flat nose, thick lips and luminous eyes. They each wore blue divers' suits.

They began to speak at high-speed in an unknown language. Vega looked into their glowing eyes. The little men stared back, seeming to ""penetrate"" his mind.

Vega replied that he would tell her later. The three men then held each other's hands, and told Vega, ""We need you. Goodbye."" **The men transformed back into three orbs of light and flew away.** Vega says that the entire event lasted about twenty-five minutes.

From the book Sky People - Untold Stories of Alien Encounters in Mesoamerica by Dr. Ardy Sixkiller Clarke, PhD (the author interviewed many indigenous people in South America who saw UFOs and aliens near their villages):

“Hugo, have you ever seen aliens or spaceships at this site?” I asked.

“I have seen spaceships many times. It does not matter; they come during the day and night. They never come when there are tourists. Personally, I have never seen an alien or a Sky God, or whatever you choose to call them, but the men \[workers\] tell me they frequently land their ships near the Acropolis and get out and walk around. They say they hear their chanting at night.”

“Do they ever describe what they look like?” I asked.

**“Sometimes they come as balls of light and turn into men that look just like them. Other times they look like people but are not people.”**

“Can you explain?”

“They never really talk about it. They are too afraid, but although they have the form of a man, they are not men. That is all I know.”

(SNIP)

“Tell me about the Star People who live among us.”

(SNIP)

“What do they look like?” I asked.

“Like you and me. They can look like anyone they like. On this planet they look human. On another they look like the dominant species.”

“Why do you call them the Shining People?” I asked.

**“In their true state, they are balls of light.** It is only when they assume human form that you see them. Otherwise you are blinded by them. **Many people never know they have met them. They see balls of light, not realizing that they are actually living forms.”**

(SNIP)

“The year was 1982. I was thirteen years old. I lived in the same village as Mateo. It was July—July 15, to be exact. I remember because it was my birthday.

(snip)

The priest nodded.

“I woke up in the middle of the night. **I saw flashing lights outside**. It was very strange to me. We didn’t have electricity in our village, so I had only seen electric lights a time or two. I could even see them flashing with my eyes closed. At first I was very excited. I had never seen anything of such beauty. I tried to wake up my three brothers who slept in the same room with me. They would not awaken no matter how hard I tried.”

“Tell her about me,” Mateo said.

“In time, dear friend. I am trying to tell as it happened. I remember being told, in my mind, to go out the bedroom window. I did as I was told and crawled out the window. **Once outside I saw these colorful balls of light. Some were still in the sky but some were on the ground and when they hit the earth they transformed into men.**

(SNIP)

“What time was it?”

“Late in the evening. Before dark, but all the tourists were gone. I found myself over a mile from the entrance when the sky became dark and a lightning storm came up. Taking cover in one of the structures, I decided to wait out the storm. It lasted much longer than I expected. Darkness came and I was still inside the ruins. As the rain eased, I decided to head home. **That’s when a circular craft came out of the clouds and settled in the plaza. Three men, covered in light, came out of the craft. They stopped in front of the Temple of Inscriptions and turned themselves into balls of light.** I watched as they floated upward to the top of the entrance and then they disappeared.” He paused for a moment and lit a cigarette. “I ran across the plaza, keeping to the edges and out of sight. Before leaving the plaza, I looked back, but the craft was still there. As I walked down the hill toward the town, I saw the craft move above the trees and head south, and then in a second it was gone.”

(SNIP)

“I have seen the lights many times,” Vincente said. Everyone turned in the direction of an elder who sat at the end of the table. Pax had introduced him to me earlier as one of his closest friends. They could have passed for brothers. “Anyone who has spent time outside at night has seen the lights. Sometimes they come from a craft; sometimes they just appear. **I have seen the Sky People turn into balls of light in front of my eyes. I have also seen them disappear. They have great powers.** I always try to stay away from them. They are dangerous.”

“Please, tell me about Adan.”

“He was sixteen the night they took him. Almost a man.”

“Who took him?”

“I’m not sure. I woke in the middle of the night and woke up Gabriella. **I saw three balls of light in the backyard.** On the way out of the house, we woke up Adan, and he followed us. We stood on the porch and watched them for several minutes.” She paused and sipped her coffee, added sugar to it, and stirred.

“You said you saw lights.”

**“Yes. By that time they had become these tall beings. Not quite human, but human-looking.**

(SNIP)

“Can you describe the silhouette you saw that night?” I asked.

“I could make out a circular shadow. It cast a blue light upon the ground. **There were three balls of light that came out of it. They materialized into human-like figures.** That is what I remember. Gabriella remembers the blue light and the balls of light, but nothing else. I know what I saw. My brother was abducted.”

Salvador ate another plateful of tortillas before he spoke again. “It was later that night. I fell asleep. **A bright light woke me**. The room was like a full sun had come up, but that was not true. **Five balls of light circled my hammock.** They slowly went up and down my body. One centered over my head and stayed there.” He pointed to his forehead. “It was warm and felt good. The others centered on my chest, which became very warm. Suddenly I could breathe. I sat up and the balls of light went out the door. I followed them and just as they reached the backyard, I saw them. **Five men came out of the balls of light.** They stopped and looked at me. I saw a beam of light come from the trees above, and they disappeared upward into the light. I watched as the V-shaped machine moved upward. Red lights outlined it. It climbed into the sky and then it was gone.”

From 1968 HUMANOID SIGHTING REPORTS Compiled by Albert Rosales:

Date: 1968

Time: late night

The 5-year old witness (involved in other encounters) was lying down on his bed **when a ball of light came into the bedroom.** It was bluish in color, violet. And it was very bright, but the light did not hurt his eyes. **This light transformed into a woman**. She was about 2.20m in height, the witness was just a small child so it was difficult for him to ascertain her exact size, but she was very tall. She had raid hair and her eyes were green, but water green, transparent green, very strange eyes. She had very white skin and her lips were pin, perfect, her features were perfect. He remembers that she leaned over him and said, “Don’t worry”. He heard that inside his brain (telepathy). “Don’t worry everything is going to be OK.” Then he found himself inside a room with a metallic bed and there was a bubble around him, like a soup bubble, transparent. And the same woman was outside the bubble looking at him. She was “talking” to him, telling him that they were going to put something in him.

From 1969 HUMANOID SIGHTING REPORTS Compiled by Albert Rosales:

Location. Mt. View, California

Date: 1969

Time: late night

One night a hum and a thumping sound in her bedroom awakened the witness. **On opening her eyes she saw very bright balls of light in the corridor at the entrance to her bedroom**. The light was so bright that there were no shadows and her surroundings were almost bleached white. Remarkably her eyes, adjusted instantaneously. **As the balls of light disappeared a loud electrical popping sound was heard and three dark gray figures appeared in their place.** One of the gray figures stood out as the leader and has remained an integral part of the witness experiences. She was then taken onboard a craft and was immediately escorted and placed into a chamber where her physical body was subjected to a vibration that increased in intensity until it felt like every molecule in her body exploded.

Evidence that humans also have the ability to turn into orbs of light:

From the Betty Andreasson UFO abductions in the 1960s and 70s:

In 1978, Betty and Bob heard a whirring sound above their house. Concurrently, both were lifted out of their bodies and, along with others, entered a huge round amphitheater-like enclosure. They were greeted by tall, robed human-looking entities. They found themselves on a high walkway that surrounded the enclosure. Bob was separated from Betty. He was told that he was not as spiritually advanced as Betty and was held to wait for her. During that time **he received answers to many questions that he asked an alien who guarded him**. **Betty, on the other hand, was allowed to participate with a number of light beings in a fantastic procedure that changed her and them into balls of light and back to their light- being form.** During this abduction, Betty glanced down to the floor below and gasped. She saw two daughters and Bob’s daughter on tables being examined by aliens. She was so troubled by what she saw that the hypnotist had her temporarily forget what she saw. They were returned to their bodies and had no idea of what had just happened to them.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

From the book The Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot:

Another strikingly holographic feature of the OBE is the plasticity of the form a person assumes once they are out of the body. **After detaching from the physical, OBEers sometimes find themselves in a ghostlike body that is an exact replica of their biological body**. This caused some researchers in the past to postulate that human beings possess a ""phantom double"" not unlike the doppelganger of literature. However, recent findings have exposed problems with this assumption. Although some OBEers describe this phantom double as naked, others find themselves in bodies that are fully clothed. **This suggests that the phantom double is not a permanent energy replica of the biological body, but is instead a kind of hologram that can assume many shapes.** This notion is borne out by the fact that phantom doubles are not the only forms people find themselves in during OBEs. **There are numerous reports where people have also perceived them- selves as balls of light**, shapeless clouds of energy, and even no discernible form at all.

(SNIP)

In addition to those mentioned by Ring and Fenske, the NDE has numerous other features that are markedly holographic. ,Like OBEers, after **NDEers have detached from the physical they find themselves in one of two forms, either as a disembodied cloud of energy, or as a hologramlike body sculpted by thought.** When the latter is the case, the mind-created nature of the body is often surprisingly obvious to the NDEer. **For example, one near-death survivor says that when he first emerged from his body he looked ""something like a jellyfish""** and fell lightly to the floor like a soap bubble. Then he quickly expanded into a ghostly three-dimensional image of a naked man. However, the presence of two women in the room embarrassed him and to his surprise, this feeling caused him suddenly to become clothed (the women, however, never offered any indication that they were able to see any of this).

(SNIP)

These hologramlike bodies can be remarkably detailed. In the incident involving the man who became embarrassed at his own naked- ness, for example, the clothing he materialized for himself was so meticulously wrought that he could even make out the seams in the material!41 **Similarly, another man who studied his hands while in the ND state said they were ""composed of light with tiny structures in them"" and when he looked closely he could even see ""the delicate whorls of his fingerprints and tubes of light up his arms.""**

He was hesitant. Most free days he sleeps until noon and I get the feeling he's not very happy in life. He doesn’t say it sounds fun or anything but starts going over what he would even wear since it’s so cold outside and I tell him what I’m wearing and suggest he can wear something similar which I know he owns. 

Since he doesn’t seem excited, to try to make the offer more tempting and because I don’t want him to sit inside all day I suggested we should also get some coffee since it's snowy and cold outside, that way we can stay warm. He replies bluntly saying that buying coffee might be unnecessary since he hadn't left his place and could make us some. But moves on to way that he don’t know where he'd put it and just ends the sentence in a question mark (in one of his backpacks maybe?). I'm starting to feel like I'm dragging a person that really doesn't want to be dragged and the whole idea doesn’t feel that fun anymore. 

Since I didn’t get a clear answer as to wether he would bring coffee I ask him if he could buy us some in case he wouldn’t be able to bring it. He just says I might as well buy it for us. At this point the whole attitude started getting on my nerves. I just replied that he can tell me when he's on his way. 

Since I didn't know if he would bring coffee on his own and frankly since my suggestion of buying coffee seemed like a problem to him, I informed him I had bought the coffee for myself. This made him so angry that he me I'm such a selfish person, that my communication skills are horrible and that I should have asked him if he wanted me to buy him some to be sure.

1hvtc5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/campingworld/comments/1hvtc5l/rv_furnace/,RV Furnace,"One of the greatest perks to camping in an RV instead of a tent is reliable cooling and heating. It’s much more comfortable to wake up and prep your coffee in a heated recreational vehicle than climbing out of a wet tent to light your camp stove and try to get a fire going. 

Just like residential units, RV heating systems require regular maintenance. But how can you service or repair an RV furnace if you don’t know how it works? To maintain an RV furnace, you’ll need to know how it works.

**An RV furnace heats air and then circulates it through your RV using a fan.** Most RV furnaces operate on DC power even when your RV is plugged into shore power, allowing them to work at a campground or when camping off-grid.

But there’s much more to it. So let’s dive into everything you need to know about operating, servicing, and troubleshooting RV furnaces.  

# How Do RV Heating Systems Work?

There are two main types of RV heating systems: forced air furnaces and hydronic heating systems. 

**In forced air furnaces,** outside air for combustion is force-fed through a sealed combustion chamber assembly and discharged to the exterior, while interior air of the RV is moved across a heat exchanger. This design ensures that no products of combustion are mixed with the interior air.

**Hydronic heating systems** use a heated surface to heat water that is distributed to radiators throughout the RV. That surface can be heated by burning fuel (i.e., propane or diesel), an electric element, or using primary engine coolant to heat that surface. Some hydronic heating systems heat potable water and can be used for engine preheating. 

***Technician Tip:*** *All RV heating systems should have a data plate containing the manufacturer, make, model, serial number, and input and output (measured in BTUs/hour) of the appliance. This plate helps you identify your appliance for specific service and maintenance procedures. Your owner’s manual can also help you understand the type of heating system you’re working with.*

# How Does an RV Furnace Work?

If you’re working with a forced air RV furnace, heat is distributed throughout your RV using a fan that’s powered by a small blower motor. Most forced air furnaces burn propane to heat air, but some utilize diesel fuel (more common with hydronic heating systems). 

Before we outline the process, let’s define a few key terms. 

**A sail switch** is the first safety switch in an RV furnace. It prevents your furnace from attempting the ignition sequence if the blower motor isn’t running at a minimum of 75% of its rated speed. 

**A limit switch** is the second safety switch. It opens at a preset temperature to prevent overheating. The limit switch is mounted on the heat exchanger or the burner assembly housing. It shuts off the burner but allows the combustion blower to continue running to lower the equipment temperature.

***Safety Tip:*** *The limit switch does NOT act as a thermostat. If your blower never shuts off, but your burner is cycling on and off at regular intervals, your RV should be inspected by a qualified RV technician immediately. This is a symptom of an overheating limit switch, which could result from blockages, faulty components, or LP gas adjustment issues that create a very dangerous situation.* 

When you turn on your RV furnace, here’s a general overview of what happens: 

1. The thermostat is turned on and signals for heat. 
2. An electrical current is sent from the thermostat to the time delay relay built into the circuit board, which closes to energize the blower motor after a delay of 10-20 seconds. If the motor isn’t reaching 75% of its rated speed, potential issues include low DC power, a faulty motor, a blocked return air inlet, or a blocked exhaust. 
3. When the motor comes up to speed, the sail switch is moved by the airflow to close a micro-switch and continue the circuit. The micro-switch is set to require a minimum fan speed to close. If the motor isn’t running fast enough, you have a sticky switch, or there’s an airflow blockage that doesn’t allow the switch to close – the current will be interrupted. This circuit is independent of the thermostat and motor circuit.
4. The sail switch closes, sending power to the limit switch, which then sends power to the circuit board. Under normal operation, the limit switch is closed and opens at a preset temperature to prevent overheating. 
5. The circuit board delays ignition for 10-20 seconds, allowing the blower motor to purge any gas remaining in the combustion chamber.

 

1. The circuit board opens the gas valve and sends a high-voltage current to the electrode.

 

1. If ignition occurs, the electrode senses the flame and sends a current back to the control board, stopping the high-voltage spark and keeping the gas valve open

 

1. If ignition doesn’t occur, the board will go into lockout mode and need to be reset before trying again. Most circuit boards will pause for 20 seconds, then try for 7 seconds. They’ll repeat this three times before going into lockout.

***Technician Tip:*** *A lockout can result from a faulty circuit board, faulty electrode, faulty gas valve, or any combination of these issues. If locked out, conduct a brief inspection (LP gas on, no airflow obstructions, proper voltage, etc.) and then switch the thermostat off and back on. The circuit board should provide three more tries.*  

# How to Reset an RV Furnace

To reset most RV furnaces, you’ll simply turn off the power switch, wait about 10 seconds, and turn it back on. If your model doesn’t have a power switch, turn off the main breaker to the furnace, wait 10 seconds, and turn it back on. 

If no breaker exists, remove and reinstall the fuse corresponding to your RV furnace. That’s why it’s important to have your RV’s circuit breaker panel properly labeled. 

[Learn more about troubleshooting RV circuit breakers.](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/troubleshooting-circuit-breakers/)

# Where is My RV Furnace Located?

Your furnace location depends on the manufacturer and the floorplan. For example, the furnace in my [Sunset Park Sunlite Classic](https://rv.campingworld.com/product/sunset-park-rv/sun-lite) is located below the refrigerator and to the left of my circuit breaker panel. 

Regardless of your floorplan, understand that the furnace itself won’t be visible. You will see a return air vent (or vents) inside your RV and the air intake/exhaust vent on the RV's exterior. Here’s an example of what your return air and exhaust vents might look like: 

(insert photo)

***Technician Tip:*** *It is a good practice to locate the exhaust vent on the RV's exterior and verify the exhaust is present and clear. We’ve seen too many campers lean a lawn chair against the vent, which could present a fire danger.*

If you’re [shopping for an RV](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/finding-your-rv/where-should-you-start-when-shopping-for-an-rv/), it’s a good idea to look for a model with an exterior access panel to service the RV furnace. This panel isn’t included on all RVs, especially [entry-level travel trailers](https://rv.campingworld.com/rvclass/travel-trailer-rvs).

# How to Turn on an RV Furnace

Most RV furnaces are controlled by a wall-mounted thermostat. Depending on your make and model, you may have a digital control panel or an analog thermostat. 

Most analog thermostats have a small On/Off toggle switch on top, and RVs with a digital control panel will have a display for turning your furnace on and off. In either case, your next step is adjusting the thermostat to a setting above the current ambient temperature inside your RV. 

If your furnace is functioning properly, you should hear the blower motor turn on first and feel air blowing out of your interior vents. Within 10-20 seconds, you should hear the pilot light ignite and feel warm air coming out of your vents shortly thereafter. 

If you leave your furnace on, it should continue to cycle on and off to keep the inside of your RV at the desired temperature. 

# How Much Propane Does My RV Furnace Use?

To operate your RV furnace, you’ll need an adequate propane supply. If you're not already familiar, take the time to learn about [connecting and turning on propane in your RV](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/how-to-connect-propane/). 

The amount of propane your furnace uses depends largely on its BTU rating. BTU is short for British Thermal Units, which is a unit of heat measuring how much heat it takes to raise the temperature of one pound of water by 1℉ at sea level. 

A furnace with a higher BTU rating burns propane more quickly than one with a lower rating. So your first step will be determining your furnace’s BTU rating, measured in BTUs per hour. 

Before we get caught up in the numbers below, **remember that your RV furnace won’t run continuously once you turn it on and adjust the thermostat. It will cycle on and off to regulate the temperature inside your coach.** This is critical to remember when calculating how much propane your RV furnace uses. 

Let’s provide an example: 

# RV and Furnace Specs (let’s use specs for the [Keystone Cougar 30BHS](https://www.keystonerv.com/product/cougar-half-ton/luxury-travel-trailers/floorplans/30BHS))

* **Propane Capacity:** 60 pounds
* **Furnace BTU Rating:** 30,000 BTUs/hr
* **Electric Fireplace BTU Rating:** 5,500 BTUs/hr

# RV Furnace Propane Consumption Calculator

To start, we must remember that propane containers can only be filled to 80% of their total capacity. So while the Cougar’s advertised propane capacity is 60 pounds, its actual capacity is 48 pounds (60 x 0.8 = 48). 

We can calculate the total BTUs of 48 pounds of propane from there. 

1 pound of propane = 21,548 BTUs

48 pounds of propane = 1,034,304 BTUs

If our total propane supply accounts for 1,034,304 BTUs, we can divide that by our furnace’s BTU rating to estimate how many hours our furnace would run before that supply is exhausted. 

1,034,304 BTUs / 30,000 BTUs/hr = \~34.48 hours

If we run our furnace and electric fireplace simultaneously, you can actually reduce your rate of propane consumption because you’re also relying on electric heat: 

30,000 BTUs - 5,500 BTUs = 24,500 BTUs

1,034,304 BTUs / 24,500 BTUs/hr = \~42.22 hours

You can insert the appropriate figures from your RV into the example above to calculate how much propane your RV furnace uses. But remember that these calculations are based on an operation of 100% run time. 

Other variables, such as local weather and your desired temperature setting, impact your furnace’s potential operating hours on a full LP supply. For instance, you can roughly double the number of hours your furnace will operate if you estimate a 50% duty cycle (i.e., your furnace will run for half the time you’re camping). 

Here are some [tips on conserving propane in your RV](https://blog.campingworld.com/at-the-campsite/3-tips-for-conserving-propane/).

***Technician Tip:*** *Remember there are other propane appliances in your RV. The calculations above represent only the available operating hours for your RV furnace, but they can be used if you know the BTU ratings of your RV’s other appliances, such as your water heater, refrigerator, stove, oven, and outdoor grill.* 

# How to Clean an RV Furnace

Pet hair can be a problem for certain RV furnaces. For starters, [cleaning and disinfecting your RV after every trip](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/ask-an-expert-cleaning-and-disinfecting-your-rv-after-a-trip/) keeps it in the best shape possible, and it’ll help your RV furnace run more efficiently. 

Inside your RV, use an RV vacuum to keep dust and dander to a minimum. You can remove the return air vent to vacuum dust and pet hair around your furnace unit on some floorplans. Just turn the furnace off before doing so. 

Outside your RV, use a portable air compressor to remove dust, debris, pet hair, and insect nests from your furnace’s exhaust tube. This is a good thing to add to your seasonal maintenance list when [winterizing your RV](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/how-to-winterize-your-rv/) in the fall and [dewinterizing it to prep for spring camping](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/tips-for-taking-your-rv-out-of-winter-storage/).  

***Technician Tip:*** *Please note that forced air furnaces (not hydronic heating systems) are designed to operate without filters. If you were to acquire and find a way to install a filter on your forced air furnace, it would void any existing warranties and create a potentially dangerous situation.*

# RV Furnace Troubleshooting Tips

Troubleshooting your RV furnace can be complex, but we have a few downloadable resources to help. You can also [schedule a service appointment](https://rv.campingworld.com/service) at your local Camping World Service Center for a professional furnace inspection. 

Here’s a decision tree for troubleshooting RV furnaces. 

And here’s another specifically for thermostat-related issues. 

Beyond that, you can do some basic troubleshooting with the right tools. 

# Measuring Line Voltage Using a Digital Multimeter

1. Measure incoming voltage at the wire connections on the side of the furnace. The nominal voltage should be 10.5 to 13.5 volts DC under an ***unloaded*** condition. If less than 10.5 VDC, the blower motor won’t spin fast enough to activate the sail switch.
2. Turn the furnace on and verify the ignition. 
3. Measure the voltage at the wire connections on the side of the furnace. The nominal voltage should be 10.5 to 13.5 volts DC under a ***loaded*** condition. 

If measurements found are outside the acceptable range, you may have an issue with your RV’s DC power supply (i.e., your battery). Consult your service manual for further furnace diagnostic tips. 

# Evaluating Proper Airflow

1. Open all discharge registers and any closeable registers inside your RV and verify air discharge by feel (or using an air speed indicator). 
2. Ensure that airflow isn’t hindered by throw rugs or other floor coverings. Hindering your furnace’s airflow can cause the limit switch to open. 
3. Verify that the discharge is warm and check that no carbon monoxide is present using a carbon monoxide test. 
4. Check the opening size for the furnace’s return airflow, ensuring it matches your unit’s operating manual specifications. 

Other tests are required to verify the proper operation of your RV’s propane system – not to mention the added complexity of hydronic heating systems.

i tell them i can’t eat garlic because it makes me feel sick… anything with garlic makes me sick (sucks bc i love garlic) and my parents say i’m overreacting, i’m being dramatic, i’m being a brat, they say “you must have parasites or something”, they tell me “well how come you never complained about it when you were younger?” as if aging isn’t a fucking thing ???? if my mom makes food she always uses garlic and tells me she didn’t… because they think i’m… lying, i guess? what fucking reason would i have to lie about garlic making me sick? plus this is a very common thing… food intolerances are a fucking thing. 

they also don’t take my job (which i’ve been doing for 9 years and got a degree on…) seriously. they constantly make fun of how little i get paid (as if i loveeee being underpaid! plus i live in a third world country where basically every job is underpaid…) and if they’re driving me to work they don’t give a fuck about getting me there late… they act as if i don’t have any obligations or responsibilities at my job ???? 

i got them to watch wicked at home with me, and during the first 10 mins all they did was say stuff like “she’s black” “so what’s the moral of the story???” “this movie must be about racism because i haven’t learned anything from it” (yes, 10 mins into a 2,30 hour movie) they would fall asleep during the movie, talk over the songs (about stuff not related to the movie), not pay attention in general… at the end, my mom said “i didn’t like it because i like movies with happy endings” ?????? 

a couple days later i explained the movie to them, snd their reaction was “so what are you supposed to do with knowing all that?” as in, what a waste of time for me to watch, enjoy and fucking pay attention to a movie????? something they do on a DAILY basis????? or i guess paying attention to the movie they put on isn’t really a thing they do?

then i talked about broadway, i showed them that one clip of Cynthia E. singing “i am here” and they said “so she’s singing in the theatre with no mic?” and i said “they are mic’d up, but the mics are on their wigs/forehead” and showed them the mic on cynthia’s forehead and they started laughing and saying “yeah right, that’s a mic” “wow that’s a technology we didn’t know existed” as if i’m just too naive to believe that’s a mic… i said “they’ve done this for ages… it’s broadway, why don’t you learn a little bit about culture?” and they kept laughing and said “okay well that’s enough you shouldn’t be so obsessed over anything” i literally talked about broadway for maybe 3 mins? and showed them like 2 10 sec clips??? 

i don’t understand why they must be so condescending toward me and act like i’m a child learning how to socialize and just saying random dinosaur facts at the most inappropriate times. i’m just trying to share with them… they themselves have asked me to open up to them, i’m trying to do it, and this is their response. it just makes me want to be at home as little as possible… i honestly can’t even make coffee without my mom saying something passive aggressive. i wake up, go to the kitchen and my mom immediately is complaining to me about something random about me… could me my outfit, my makeup, my hair, my shoes, my weight, my breakfast, my choice of foods (consuming less red meat compared to them, no garlic) i’m not even talking about me not having a healthy diet… we all eat the same things, except i don’t like beef that much so i don’t have it twice a day every single day like they do (it also hurts my gums…) 

if they complain about me waking up too late, then i wake up early the next day, but when they see me awake early they say stuff like “so you didn’t sleep at all” “WOW what a miracle! HOW did you do that???” “WHY are you awake this early!” and i PROMISE they’re not trying to be funny and casual like americans are. they’re just being rude… they don’t use a tone of “haha you’re so silly!” it’s a tone of “damn you really are stupid” 

i’m honestly so tired of it all. i try to speak to them as little as possible to avoid having these kind of interactions but it’s impossible to avoid because they always have something negative to say about me. it’s fucking exhausting and if i try to talk to someone about it they always say “well, that’s how parents are!” like okay that might be true but that comment isn’t helpful or nice. moving out isn’t an option for a while.

1hvt7f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1hvt7f6/should_i_get_a_formal_adhd_evaluation/,Should I get a formal adhd evaluation?,"Hi! I have felt like I possibly have some kind of inattentive adhd for many years but have never been formally evaluated. Now that I am an adult and can see my shortcomings more clearly, I have been considering asking for an evaluation. I wanted to ask you all if you think that would be a good idea based on my experience/symptoms below. I am not asking for a Reddit diagnosis, rather just some input on whether or not I am overthinking my experience or if I really should get evaluated. 

Here is what I have been feeling for many years:
- Disorganized: the funny thing is, I hate clutter/messes but I seem to be incapable of keeping spaces clean and organized for long. I can make spaces appear clean but usually this means sticking things in random cabinets and closets lol. I’m also one of those people that has a million unread notifications on my phone because I can’t seem to keep up with them and I put off responding…which leads me to my next point…
- Procrastination: sometimes I put things off and I don’t even know why? For example, there is a to-go coffee cup sitting on my kitchen table that I need to toss. Every time I see it, I tell myself “I need to throw that away” and then I just…don’t? I also will make myself busy with certain tasks to avoid/put off working on the bigger more daunting ones.
- Forgetful: my short term memory is CRAP. At work, if I’m asked to do something, I have to immediately write it down or else I’ll forget. I also frequently tell myself “oh I need to remember to bring XYZ to work today” and literally minutes later I forget. When I was in college, I had to write down EVERY due date/deadline in my planner or else I would definitely forget. Thankfully I never lost that planner….that thing was my brain. 
- Scatter brained: I don’t even know how to explain this one. I can’t cook without making a mess unless I make a very intense conscious effort to prep things ahead of time and stay on track. I bounce from one task to the next, making some progress on each one but never finishing any of them. 
- Difficulty focusing/listening: this is another one of those things that I have to work really hard to do. Often times I find myself zoning out while someone is talking directly to me. I do it a lot with my husband. It makes me feel like such a horrible friend/wife. 
- Daydreaming: pretty self explanatory. 
- Issues with momentum: once I get started, I can usually keep myself going until I lose momentum and slow down. It’s the getting started part that’s hard for me. 
- 
I’m sure there’s more but I’ll leave it at that for now. Also, keep in mind, I am a fairly new mother and currently pregnant, which has exacerbated all of the above. But they have been present for a long time to varying degrees. 

As a child, I was very quiet, shy, well behaved, and extremely sensitive. I have become much more confident, vocal, and have developed tougher skin in my adulthood. However, I think I am still generally seen as a nice, even tempered, easy going but fairly sensitive person. 

In elementary school I have memories of bursting into tears in the middle of class because I couldn’t keep up as we read together and I kept losing track of where we were. But I also sometimes did really well to the point that I was the only student in my class that answered certain grammatical test questions correctly and was rewarded for it in front of the class. In middle school, I almost failed multiple history classes because I could NOT bring myself to study. For me, history class was just memorizing important dates, names, and events. There wasn’t a lot of problem solving or application, so it’s like my brain just could not retain or care about the info. 

I did MUCH better in college and even graduated magna cum laude, but I think that had to do with the fact that I was very interested in my major. I still struggled quite a bit with focus and studying but I got through it okay. 

From the outside, I think I probably appear “normal” or like I somewhat have my life together.

I think what is holding me back from getting evaluated is the fear that it will turn out that I don’t have adhd and I am in fact just a lazy, undisciplined person…🥲

1hvt76e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1hvt76e/baby_step_solo_trips_with_what_ifs/,Baby step solo trips with 'what ifs',"For the past year I've noticed my intense fear around the idea of going out and doing things by myself. It's embarrassing being 27 and having never gone anywhere by myself besides some doctor appointments and therapy when I was still going. 
I've finally been able to be okay with going to the gym by myself, it's a plus as our gym has an upstairs no one goes into so if my anxiety is too high I'll go up there. 
I've gathered a few more 'alone trip' ideas but have yet to act on them because I'm stuck on 'what if' scenarios. 
1. The theater. Seems easy enough right? The easiest thing I should be able to do? No, what if people think there's something wrong with me when they see I'm all alone at the movies? It's stupid, I know.
2. Cafe. Where I could also do some writing or read for awhile as I enough some food and a coffee. But what I they kick me out for how long I'm staying there? Because I'm ""loitering?"" Or even, just like the theater, why am I out to eat by myself like a loser?
3. Library. Same as the cafe, I'd like to go read a couple hours or work on my writing but what if they kick me out? What if they watch me the entire time for ""suspicious behavior"" because I'm not just getting a book and leaving? I always feel like I'm being watched and that I'm guilty of something although I have nothing to be guilty of.


I haven't even been able to go to a salon in a year for a haircut because my last encounter had me feeling so awkward I feel too anxious to go back to a salon. Another thing I keep planning in my head to do but haven't managed to make the call yet. 
I just wish there was a therapy where they could go out with you and wait for you somewhere while you do your own thing and then go back to them when you need them. 


And my absolute biggest what if with all of this is that I don't drive. I rely on a rideshare service. So what if I get to the place I want to be and I start panicking and wish to leave? Can't do that if I have to wait for a ride.
Ugh dealing with this and having CPTSD where I'm just terrified of getting hurt by someone is a nightmare and all I want for this year is to defeat all of this. 
Does anyone maybe have solutions for those thoughts? For what to do if you start panicking? ",4,1736261818.0,Agoraphobia,1,0.84,False

We ended up going for a coffee and wine, also she asked me to come to her house. We had sex and next day she asked me if I want something casual or serious. I wanted serious, she wanted casual. We still hanged out after this, she started acting more like we had something serious, and I asked her what she actually wanted from me. The thing is, she recently ended a long relationship of 5-6 years and she is not sure she wants to take things to the next level. What is confusing for me is that we texted daily even in this period with holidays and all that stuff (we are not from the same home city) and she was making a lot of plans for both of us, talking with her parents about me, even wanted to spend the new Years eve together. But I was feeling her like she isn't sure about all this stuff so I asked her and her mind didn't change, she still wanted to have something casual. She gave me motives like it's still early from her last breakup and she likes me but can't feel more than that. 



I ended up saying that I don't want to f\*\*k around and treat someone like I have something serious with them, but without actually being in a relationship, and that we should go on with our lives since we don't want the same thing.

This is a great tool if you want to really need out on your espresso journey. I admit, with taste sometimes being subjective and dependent know your taste buds on a particular day or time, it can be sometimes hard to judge my shots and I fall in the trap of making adjustments that are not needed and end up chasing a ghost. I decided to get a TDS Refractometer so that I could see exactly the percentage of my extractions and the TDS levels. The device also comes with an app which will analyze your dose, yield, temperature, time, extraction %, and TDS % and tell you where the shot is on a chart on a basic scale of weak to strong and sour to bitter with the sweet spot in the middle. The pro scale shows you a chart of where you are and where you would be with changes in ratio, extraction %, and TDS %. After doing my test a few times I found my shot was right in the sweet spot—20 grams in 42 grams out in 25 seconds. TDS% = 9.86, Extraction % = 20.71.

Yeah, I know just pull my shot and drink it! All that crap was unnecessary! Ok, you may have a point, but it was fun to me and I shared it because maybe it might be fun for someone else to nerd out on their espresso like me!🤣🤣🤣",2,1736261445.0,espresso,0,0.75,False

1hvt1c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hvt1c5/step_mother_from_hell/,Step mother from hell,"My mother and father broke up when I was 3 years old. He got an apartment a couple of blocks away from my mother so it would be easier for them to take care of me.

During this time period, he met a woman. Because of his new relationship with this woman (she had a son), I didnt get to see my father for a whole year.

I remember the first time I met her, she seemed to be a nice person, but it all changed when my father moved in with her and her son in a different town.

First of all I don't remember everything that has happened over the years, but I can tell you that I hated to go to my dad every other weekend because of her. 

It felt like I was stepping on egg shells everytime I was there, I started to breath and move silent just to avoid an altercation with her. There is one memory that has really latched on to me, I was about 9-10 years old and had just came out of the shower - I like to sing during the shower-process so that's what I did. 
All of a sudden she called my name and said: 

""you can't sing, so stop singing."" And so I did. 

She always had something bad to say to me, no matter what I was doing. My father who is afraid to have arguments, didn't stand up for me once. 

I met my dad twice a month, so when I came there I was happy to be with him, but she of course took notice of that and started to tell me that I have to go outside and play, and he didnt argue with her. 

One time my father drove me home to my moms place. He then had a conversation with my her on the balcony, my mother got furious over something and didn't let me see him for a full year. She didnt tell me why she was furious until i was about 20 years old.

Apparently he told her that his girlfriend had given him an ultimatum, he had to choose between her and her son or me.

Anyways, she became a control-freak. My father also became a ""servant"" to her. She completly broke him down. 
He told me and my mother that every week he came home from work, he would find all his stuff packed in a luggage laying on the bed, as a threat.

When I became 18 I decided to stop visiting my father, I didnt see him for 10 years (They are still together). But last year i decided to meet him, and that shit was dreadful. 

He told me that I could come for a sleep-over, he also told me that his girlfriend was on vacation in Spain. 

First of all, he picked me up. We went to the store to buy snacks. He asked me if I could buy it all, which I had no problem with. In the parking lot he told me that he didnt want my step mother to see that he had bought snacks on his bank account. I got a bit anxious over the situation because it felt like I had traveled back in time. 

Anyways we came home to him and we had a blast, playing videogames all day long. Right before bedtime he asked me where i want to sleep, I told him that I could sleep in the guest room. 

He then told me that we had to take a picture of the bed before I layed in it. Turns out that my step mother didn't know I was there, so he had to take a photo. He would then use the photo as a guide in order to make the bed look the same after I left.

A heavy feeling appeared in my stomach and all the anxiety from when I was a child came back. I wanted to leave, but it was too late in the evening. 

The day after, we ate breakfast. He asked me if I could make some coffee, he then told me to be careful so i dont drop any coffee powder on the counter.

""She will notice it"" he said.

A couple of hours later I was about to leave, he told me to take all the leftover snacks with me. Apparently he couldn't throw it at their place, because she would find it...

I took all the snacks and left. 

I am glad that I finally met him but at the same time, I am angry/sad, I thought these 10 years would change something... but it just made me feel like an anxious kid again.",3,1736261354.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

The Breville BES870XL Barista Express espresso machine is a popular choice among home baristas, known for its impressive features and ability to produce cafe-quality espresso.  But the price tag can be daunting.  This is where a refurbished Breville BES870XL Barista Express comes in – offering a premium espresso experience at a significantly lower cost. This article will explore the benefits of purchasing a refurbished model, its key features, and how it compares to other options on the market.


## Understanding the Breville BES870XL Barista Express

First launched to much fanfare, the Breville BES870XL Barista Express quickly established itself as a leader in the home espresso machine market. Its popularity stems from its impressive combination of features designed for ease of use and high-quality espresso production.  Key features include:

* **15-bar Italian Pump:** This pump ensures consistent pressure for optimal espresso extraction, resulting in rich crema and balanced flavor profiles.  This is a critical component for achieving that perfect espresso shot.
* **Integrated Conical Burr Grinder:**  Freshly ground beans are essential for superior espresso.  The integrated grinder eliminates the need for a separate grinder, simplifying the brewing process and ensuring optimal freshness.  The conical burrs provide consistent particle size for even extraction.
* **Thermocoil Heating System:**  This system efficiently heats the water, maintaining a stable temperature for consistent brewing.  This is vital for producing espresso with the right balance of flavor and body.
* **Stainless Steel Construction:**  The durable stainless steel construction ensures longevity and a premium look.


This machine consistently receives high praise from users, boasting a 4.8-star rating based on thousands of reviews.  These reviews frequently highlight its ease of use, even for beginners, and its ability to produce professional-quality espresso at home.


## What Does """"Refurbished"""" Mean?

When considering a refurbished espresso machine, it's important to understand what this entails.  A refurbished machine is a pre-owned unit that has been thoroughly inspected, cleaned, and repaired (if necessary) by a qualified technician. This process aims to restore the machine to its original working condition and often includes replacing worn-out parts.  This contrasts with a """"used"""" machine, which may have unseen issues or require immediate repairs.


## Advantages of a Refurbished Breville BES870XL

The primary advantage of purchasing a refurbished Breville BES870XL is the significant cost savings.  You can often find refurbished models for 30-50% less than the price of a new machine [2][5], making high-end espresso technology accessible to a wider audience.

Beyond the cost savings, reputable sellers of refurbished machines offer quality assurance.  They typically provide thorough inspections, repairs, and sometimes even warranties [5], mitigating the risks associated with buying used equipment.  This means you can enjoy the benefits of a premium machine with added peace of mind.


## Key Features of the Refurbished Breville BES870XL

The features of a refurbished Breville BES870XL are identical to those of a new model.  You still get:

* **Exceptional Espresso Performance:** The 15-bar pump and integrated grinder ensure consistent, high-quality espresso shots every time.
* **User-Friendly Design:** The intuitive interface and pre-programmed settings make it easy to use, even for beginners.  Mastering espresso techniques becomes less daunting.
* **Durable Construction:** The stainless steel construction ensures the machine will last for years to come with proper care.
* **Efficient Thermocoil Technology:**  Enjoy consistent water temperature for optimal espresso extraction.


## Customer Testimonials and Reviews

Online reviews consistently praise the Breville BES870XL for its ease of use, consistent espresso quality, and overall value.  Many users highlight the convenience of the integrated grinder and the quality of the espresso produced.  While minor issues, like occasional inconsistencies in grinding or minor leaks, are sometimes reported [1], these are often user-related and easily addressed with proper maintenance and cleaning.  Reputable refurbishers often address these common issues as part of the refurbishment process.


## Comparative Analysis: Refurbished Breville BES870XL vs. Other Options

The refurbished Breville BES870XL competes with other popular refurbished espresso machines, such as the Quick Mill Vetrano 2B Evo and Rocket Espresso Mozzafiato Cronometro R [5]. These machines often offer similar features, but the Breville BES870XL stands out for its user-friendly interface and integrated grinder, making it a more accessible option for home baristas.  While the other machines may offer more advanced features, the Breville provides a great balance of performance and ease of use at a more budget-friendly price point.


## Practical Tips for Using Your Refurbished Breville BES870XL

To maximize the lifespan and performance of your refurbished Breville BES870XL, follow these tips:

* **Regular Cleaning:**  Clean the machine regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions.  This includes backflushing the group head and cleaning the grinder.
* **Proper Grinding and Tamping:**  Consistent grinding and tamping are crucial for optimal espresso extraction.  Experiment to find the ideal grind size and tamping pressure for your beans.
* **Water Quality:**  Use filtered water to prevent mineral buildup and maintain the machine's performance.


## Conclusion:  Premium Espresso Without the Premium Price

A refurbished Breville BES870XL Barista Express offers a compelling value proposition for coffee enthusiasts seeking a high-quality espresso machine without breaking the bank.  The significant cost savings, combined with the assurance of a thorough refurbishment process, make it an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers who don't want to compromise on quality.  With its user-friendly design and ability to produce exceptional espresso, the refurbished Breville BES870XL is a fantastic investment for any home barista.

1hvsros,https://i.redd.it/z3arhir42lbe1.jpeg,"For those staying home, whatcha been up to?","Good morning on Day #4 of Snowmageddon. My husband and I are retired and thankful we don’t have to get out, although we are going a little stir crazy. 

The buildup and wait for this storm was a bit tortuous thanks largely to Bill Meck. He’s good at what he does but gets way too much airtime. We prepped accordingly and were ready to eat milk sandwiches if need be. 

Our dogs had different opinions about the actual storm. Our elderly demented dog Lucy, a collie retriever mix with a thick coat, would have happily laid out in the yard until the sleet started. We compromised by keeping a heater on across from her bed on the porch. Our little, Missy the Covid dog shih tzu, wanted nothing to do with it, especially when the snow was belly deep. She could no longer smell her usual spots and required an escort, and a dug out spot thanks to hubby, to take care of business. Yes, our dogs have it better than some people. 

I have the bake in emergencies gene and had to resist doing so as we had plenty of sweets after Christmas. 

The first day I deep cleaned the kitchen (fun), made good use if our leftovers (hopping john and a roast turkey breast and sides), finishing up the apple pie I made for New Years. We binge watched Harlan Coben’s latest English detective series while I finished knitting a scarf and fingerless glove set. We checked in with family in Texas, WV, and western Kentucky sharing pics of the outdoor transformation. 

Yesterday, we awoke to an ice planet. The limbs on our little dogwood in the front yard were bent to the ground under the weight of the ice. Some of our neighbors lost limbs on their trees. A few intrepid souls who probably had no choice but to work left tracks in the packed snow and ice on our street. Missy figured out she could walk on top of the frozen snow and made investigatory ventures outside. Lucy spent more time than usual indoors (she loves her porch time). I made omelets for breakfast, soup and sandwiches for lunch, and lasagna for dinner. I was proud of myself that I had all the ingredients on hand even though I hadn’t planned on making it. 

Since I was done with my knitting project, I pulled out some cast off prints from classmates at my printmaking class at UK and began making horses from them. I followed the directions the first time then took my own path. I will put a link to the pattern in the comments for those of you who want to try it. I’m happy with the direction it’s going. 

Hubby chipped ice off the car that doesn’t live in the garage and read a book on his Kindle. Last night we watched a strange but good movie, Nightbitch with Amy Adams. The title gives nothing away, and I won’t either except to say it’s deep and explores motherhood and life choices. As an artist, I related to the way Mother sees the world. 

This morning looks a lot like yesterday. I allowed myself to sleep in until 8:30. Hubby got his own breakfast and is braving the cold and neighborhood streets for a walk in the mall. I’m enjoying my coffee and writing this. A little later, I’ll share some lasagna over the fence with our back door neighbor for their supper. They’re a young family with two elementary school aged boys that have stolen our hearts. I have no plan for the rest of my day but suspect more horses will be made, maybe by some of you. 

We are thankful we haven’t lost power (thank you underground utilities). While we are on emergency heat since our heat pump is covered in ice, we are warm enough and have all we need. We hope you have weathered the storm well. I look forward to reading your stories. ",22,1736260581.0,lexington,12,0.96,False
1hvsr9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hvsr9z/stepmother_from_hell/,Step-mother from hell,"My mother and father broke up when I was 3 years old. He got an apartment a couple of blocks away from my mother so it would be easier for them to take care of me.

During this time period, he met a woman. Because of his new relationship with this woman (she had a son), I didnt get to see my father for a whole year.

I remember the first time I met her, she seemed to be a nice person, but it all changed when my father moved in with her and her son in a different town.

First of all I don't remember everything that has happened over the years, but I can tell you that I hated to go to my dad every other weekend because of her. 

It felt like I was stepping on egg shells everytime I was there, I started to breath and move silent just to avoid an altercation with her. There is one memory that has really latched on to me, I was about 9-10 years old and had just came out of the shower - I like to sing during the shower-process so that's what I did. 
All of a sudden she called my name and said: 

""you can't sing, so stop singing."" And so I did. 

She always had something bad to say to me, no matter what I was doing. My father who is afraid to have arguments, didn't stand up for me once. 

I met my dad twice a month, so when I came there I was happy to be with him, but she of course took notice of that and started to tell me that I have to go outside and play, and he didnt argue with her. 

One time my father drove me home to my moms place. He then had a conversation with my her on the balcony, my mother got furious over something and didn't let me see him for a full year. She didnt tell me why she was furious until i was about 20 years old.

Apparently he told her that his girlfriend had given him an ultimatum, he had to choose between her and her son or me.

Anyways, she became a control-freak. My father also became a ""servant"" to her. She completly broke him down. 
He told me and my mother that every week he came home from work, he would find all his stuff packed in a luggage laying on the bed, as a threat.

When I became 18 I decided to stop visiting my father, I didnt see him for 10 years (They are still together). But last year i decided to meet him, and that shit was dreadful. 

He told me that I could come for a sleep-over, he also told me that his girlfriend was on vacation in Spain. 

First of all, he picked me up. We went to the store to buy snacks. He asked me if I could buy it all, which I had no problem with. In the parking lot he told me that he didnt want my step mother to see that he had bought snacks on his bank account. I got a bit anxious over the situation because it felt like I had traveled back in time. 

Anyways we came home to him and we had a blast, playing videogames all day long. Right before bedtime he asked me where i want to sleep, I told him that I could sleep in the guest room. 

He then told me that we had to take a picture of the bed before I layed in it. Turns out that my step mother didn't know I was there, so he had to take a photo. He would then use the photo as a guide in order to make the bed look the same after I left.

A heavy feeling appeared in my stomach and all the anxiety from when I was a child came back. I wanted to leave, but it was too late in the evening. 

The day after, we ate breakfast. He asked me if I could make some coffee, he then told me to be careful so i dont drop any coffee powder on the counter.

""She will notice it"" he said.

A couple of hours later I was about to leave, he told me to take all the leftover snacks with me. Apparently he couldn't throw it at their place, because she would find it...

I took all the snacks and left. 

I am glad that I finally met him but at the same time, I am angry/sad, I thought these 10 years would change something... but it just made me feel like an anxious kid again.",1,1736260547.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1hvsr6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellbutrin_Bupropion/comments/1hvsr6i/this_medication_is_the_best/,This medication is the BEST,"When I first got prescribed wellbutrin a few months ago, I found this subreddit and read a lot of ""bad reviews"" of this medication. All experiences shared here are valid and real, but it made me nervous and anxious to see how I'd feel in a month or two months when it really started to work. I was at a breaking point in my life though and trusted my doctor. I'm adding my experience here so those that were in a similar spot to me a few months ago can have another data point for the ""this truly helped me"" bucket.

  
I'd never been on medication before, but had been to talk therapy. I found myself suffering from what I thought was a really bad case of the SAD. Went to my doctor, not even feeling enough to be embarrassed or shameful about asking for help. My doctor listened and offered Wellbutrin 150 extended release as an option. I got it filled and started taking it the next morning. She also ordered some blood tests.

The immediate side effects I noticed is that I completely cut caffeine out of my life because I was so awake after taking this medication I was scared to find out what the caffeine from coffee/tea/soda would do to me. I became slightly more focused in what I was doing to the point where I would forget to eat meals unless I actively said to myself ""huh, it's lunch time, guess I should eat"". 

At my four week check in with my doctor, that was all I had to report. I wasn't necessarily less depressed than I was before, but was interacting with the world differently. Blood tests came back and showed I was single digits of Vitamin D. I got prescribed mega doses of Vitamin D, and chose to try another month of Wellbutrin.

Around five and a half weeks, I started drinking coffee again because the initial ""awake-ness"" had worn off. I became slightly less hyper focused. I was essentially returning to my ""normal"" BUT I became less depressed. I noticed this one day when I was sitting on my couch with my cat and thought to myself ""I have everything I could want or need right now, I am happy with my life how it is"". After thinking that, I thought it was such a weird thought. The next day I found myself thinking how grateful I was for this nice little life I was building for myself. 

Each day after that has gotten even better. I'm two and a half months in on this medication and it was honestly one of the best steps I've taken in my life. That plus correcting my Vitamin D - I think the medications are working in tandem. I had another checkin with my doctor and I literally told her ""I've never felt this content with my life. I feel happy. Is this how other people feel all the time? I've never experienced this before."". 

If you're starting your journey on this medication and scared because of some of the experiences posted here, my best advice is, tune it out. Trust yourself and your doctor, pay attention to how you're feeling. In my journal, I made a point to have the first thing say how I was feeling. Some examples are: ""Day 1: still depressed but very awake"" and ""Day 35: Back to normal, I guess. Social interactions feel easier"" and ""Day 66: I am so grateful for my life"". Everyone is going to have a different experience. Yours might be bad, and you might find relief on something else. BUT. Your experience might be GREAT. And in two months you might be thanking yourself for taking the leap. ",19,1736260540.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,3,0.91,False

Was in Tesco Costa with my mum after taking her to chair exercise for the first time. Popped in for a coffee and a chat. First the card reader wouldn't accept my bank card - that's a whole thing too - so I had to gwt my mum's card, then that didn't work and had to call the partially deaf woman over. It's was 12ish so it was busy. Then the woman at the table next to us practically bathed in the most perfumed hand sanitizer I have ever smelled. The woman on the table to the other side of us kept turn to us to cough so she didn't cough on her friends. (She did cover her mouth, but still...)

We finally left the cafe to do my mum's shopping and it seemed that every aisle had someone who had received perfume or aftershave for Xmas and decided to bathe in it. By the time we get to the checkout I'm flapping my fiddle (a set of connected metal loops that can be spun or flapped). By the time we get out I'm flapping it in my ear and blinking hard, eyes looking everywhere. 

I had my invisible disability lanyard on and the lady on the checkout, now I have calmed down I recognise was really good as I was not with it. Went through everything with my clubcard and packing and paying (my bankcard played up again but she sorted it). So calm and nice.

My mum still is a bit weird about my diagnosis, she accepts it's but will still get a bit embarrassed when I stim or get agitated. But before my diagnosis when I was 'masking' I would get super angry and annoyed, but she dealt with that... Then her and the cab driver (her regular driver) were gently taking the piss a bit. Knowing them, it was because it's how they cope with awkward and I don't really mind tbh.  But when I got in and hubby tried it I yelled at him, but by that point I was close to a meltdown. Poor bloke.

Her close relative passed away last week and she looks pretty upset over it though she seems to be soldiering on at work (she told me today that she just wants to not think about it). I honestly was so floored by the news I didn’t know what to say. I was thinking of extending my condolences by text along with an open invitation for dinner if she ever wanted to talk.
