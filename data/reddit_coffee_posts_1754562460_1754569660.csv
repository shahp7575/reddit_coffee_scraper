1mjylwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rambling/comments/1mjylwz/i_remember_now/,I Remember Now,"When we first met, I thought she was smart. She seemed to be smart. She was really good at the internet .

We talked a lot about things, Hawaii, she had great ideas about doing things .

She promised to be my healer and play video games with me, we were going to play music together, draw comics together, she even said that we could watch YouTube tutorials on coloring together. Lots of things we were supposed to do together, we were going to have children, or maybe Foster children and teach them all how to play music. She plays piano, her mother was a piano teacher .

I was obsessed with her. She said the term was sapiosexual, meaning that you're attracted to someone because they're smart. 

I really did think she was smarter than me when we met, she was doing things with her phone, doing things on the internet that I'd never seen before. 

But as time went on, it was obvious that her lack of experience in the real world was costing her some points on the marry me for life scale. She just had zero experience in the real world and was very obstinate about it. She still wanted to do try to do things that she didn't have any experience at, she really sucked at them but insisted on doing them anyway, even though literally anybody on earth could have done it in a fraction of the time if she had left them .

But it's not the things that piss me off so much about her that I'm recollecting at the moment, I'm sitting here in my recliner, drinking coffee, thinking about how it was supposed to be. Because that's all we talked about, playing music, doing drugs, movies coming music, art, all the things that we wanted to do together .

We never did any of those things, I even set up the piano keyboard and got out the guitars and we played for a few minutes together and it was really fun, I mean it was really amazing. And we never did it again. 

It seems that no matter what I put in front of her, no matter how hard I tried, she was just intent on being unhappy and miserable all the time. No, I remember when I was suffering from depression, the symptoms of depression not the actual clinical affliction, I just happen to have something else that caused all things to feel that way. Anyway, that's exactly what it felt like, I didn't want to do anything that made other people happy because it wasn't making me happy. I don't know if I can explain that because I'm not a psychiatrist, but anything we try to do together she just somehow seemed to ruin it every time .

Sabotage. Right, I called her a sab it to her before. I have memory issues, so I can't remember half the shit that goes on, but I'm remembering now that we had all these things that we were going to do and we never did any of them and now I'm wondering why. 

Pretty strange, we never play the video games together even though she said that she would and I said it all up, she never touched it. Never played music together, even though I said it all up and she said that she would, we never did that either. Not seriously anyway, we just noodled around that one time and it never happened again. 

So I guess what I'm realizing is that she was just spending her entire life staring at her phone, watching these idiotic tick tock shorts and YouTube crap, just mindless crap .

So I guess the term safety of sexual is still applies to me, I learned something about myself, I like smart chicks I guess. But I don't think she qualifies, I think she was somehow pretending to be normal, but is actually a complete fucking dipshit and it just doesn't want to admit to it. 

I would have to admit that she shows real genius when it comes to just plain creative thinking, forward visionary thinking, she looks at things and figures them out and it's great, but when it comes down to execute, she's simply cannot understand chronological logistics for some reason .

For instance, here are some of the ideas that she has had that I absolutely love, but when it came time to try to execute on any of them, she sabotaged them every time. It's astonishing how brilliant she can be, then turn around and absolutely destroy things like a complete fucking retard for no reason. Just absolutely no reason at all, astonishing. Anyway, rambling rambling rambling, here are some of the genius ideas that she has had that I have been unable to execute, no matter how hard I try......

By school bus is cheap and turn them into flatbeds and sell them. Since school buses are not a hot item, they sell cheap, cut them down, sell the scrap, use the flatbed which are much more popular, or sell it, either way, that's a hell of a great idea. 

Building rental shacks on the lava flows in Hawaii. This is a great idea, another one that will never get executed for the same reasons as before, she just can't do anything in real life and actually sabotages anything I try to do in real life, so this would never happen anyway. 

Simply enough, buy houses, renovate them, rent them out, refinance them, and then repeat, this is a process called BRRR. You can just watch YouTube videos about it and it's actually pretty simple, that was the plan and we moved to Pennsylvania and it all fell apart because she's batshit crazy. I'll skip the details, but it has been an excruciating amount of wasted time, energy and money driving around looking at houses, doing all kinds of stupid shit when I should have been doing literally anything else. Fucking retard idiot stupid bitch. 

Sexy landscaping service. This is hysterically funny and brilliant at the same time, if you had a 5 second YouTube clip of hot chicks mowing your yard, your phone will bring off the hook and that's not even a joke. This is the smartest thing I've ever heard of. Yes, I want to see my old ladies thinking around in the yard half naked, sweating like a pig. I bet people will pay a lot of money to see that, that's a pretty sound business idea, yes . Someone probably already does it, now that I think about it.

I‚Äôm a 42 year old guy based in the midlands, just looking to build some real connections, whether that's casual conversation, shared interests, or friendships that grow slowly over time.

Life‚Äôs been a bit quiet and introspective lately, and while I appreciate my alone time, I do miss the feeling of really clicking with someone, the kind of conversation that flows naturally, whether it‚Äôs thoughtful, silly, or somewhere in between.

I'm into music, mental health awareness, meaningful chats, and finding the small joys in everyday life. If you're someone who values honesty, reflection, and a slower pace when getting to know people, we might get along.

Not necessarily looking for anything specific, just open to seeing where a connection goes. Whether that‚Äôs grabbing a coffee someday, talking about life, or exchanging messages now and then, I‚Äôm happy to start small.

Day 3: Me staring at the screen like: üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÄ

Something felt‚Ä¶ off.

After 3 painful days of pretending I knew what was going on, I finally dove into the ad settings like a desperate raccoon in a trash can. And there it was:

**The campaign was targeting** ***worldwide*** **instead of just the U.S.**  
ü§°ü§°ü§°

Somehow, the geo-targeting didn‚Äôt save properly (or I forgot to check, still not sure if I should blame Facebook or my morning coffee). So most of the ad budget went to random traffic from places where the product wasn‚Äôt even available. Amazing.

Lesson learned the hard way:  
**Always triple-check your geo settings. Even if you** ***think*** **you already did.**

Because nothing humbles a marketer faster than realizing you just paid $60 for someone in Antarctica to see your ad for dog food subscription boxes. üêßüê∂

Anyway, hope this helps someone avoid the same pain. If you‚Äôve ever made a dumb digital marketing mistake, I‚Äôd love to hear it so I can feel less alone in my shame.

His protection doesn‚Äôt always shield us from the storm‚Äîbut it anchors us through it.‚Äù

üìñ Scripture Foundation: Psalm 147:3

""He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.""

This verse is a gentle reminder that God is not distant from our pain. He is the Great Physician, tending to the wounds we often hide from the world. Whether your heart is aching from loss, betrayal, anxiety, or exhaustion, this promise stands: healing is not only possible‚Äîit‚Äôs divine.



üïäÔ∏è Devotional Reflection

Healing is rarely instantaneous. It‚Äôs a sacred unfolding‚Äîa process of surrender, trust, and transformation. In the quiet moments, when you feel most vulnerable, God is closest. His presence doesn‚Äôt always erase the pain, but it gives it purpose. Like a gardener pruning a vine, He removes what hinders growth so that new life can flourish.

Jesus Himself was familiar with suffering. Isaiah 53:5 tells us, ‚ÄúBy His wounds we are healed.‚Äù Your healing is not just a hope‚Äîit‚Äôs a heritage. You are not alone in your journey. You walk with the One who conquered death and offers peace that surpasses understanding.



‚ú® Personal Reflection

There was a season in my life when I felt like I was walking through a fog‚Äîemotionally numb, spiritually dry, and physically drained. I kept asking, ‚ÄúWhere are You, God?‚Äù But healing began when I stopped demanding answers and started leaning into His presence. I journaled through tears, prayed through silence, and slowly, light broke through.

Healing didn‚Äôt mean everything was fixed. It meant I was no longer defined by my brokenness. I was being rebuilt‚Äîstronger, softer, and more surrendered.



üìì Journaling Prompts

Take time this week to reflect and write:

1. What wounds am I still carrying that I haven‚Äôt surrendered to God?
2. Where have I seen glimpses of healing in my life, even if small?
3. What does ‚Äúinner strength‚Äù look like for me right now?
4. How can I invite God into my healing process today?
5. Who in my life needs encouragement or prayer for their own healing?



üóùÔ∏è Key Notes for Daily Living

* Start with Stillness: Begin each day with 5 minutes of silence. Let God speak into the quiet.
* Speak Life: Replace negative self-talk with affirmations rooted in scripture (e.g., ‚ÄúI am fearfully and wonderfully made‚Äù ‚Äì Psalm 139:14).
* Guard Your Heart: Be mindful of what you consume‚Äîmedia, conversations, environments. Proverbs 4:23 says, ‚ÄúAbove all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.‚Äù
* Practice Gratitude: Write down three things you‚Äôre thankful for each day. Gratitude is a healing balm.
* Connect with Community: Healing thrives in safe spaces. Reach out to a trusted friend, mentor, or faith group.



ü§ù Call to Connection

You don‚Äôt have to walk this path alone. Healing is communal. Share your story. Ask for prayer. Offer encouragement. If this post resonates with you, consider reaching out to someone today‚Äîwhether through a message, a coffee date, or a prayer circle. Let‚Äôs be vessels of healing for one another.



üôè Closing Prayer: Inner Strength & Divine Protection

Heavenly Father,

I come to You with a heart that longs for healing. You see every wound, every tear, every silent ache. I ask for Your divine touch to restore what‚Äôs been broken. Strengthen me from within‚Äîgive me courage when I feel weak, peace when I feel anxious, and hope when I feel lost.

Protect me, Lord, from anything that seeks to steal my joy or distort my identity. Surround me with Your angels, shield me with Your truth, and fill me with Your Spirit. May I walk in the confidence of Your love and the assurance of Your promises.

I trust You, even when I don‚Äôt understand. I surrender my healing journey into Your hands.

The Blind Luna
üëâ CONTINUE READING üëà
Chapter 1
I lost my eyesight saving the Alpha of the Darkmoon Pack.

He once knelt before the altar of the Moon Goddess and swore I would be his one and only mate‚Äîthat he would be my eyes for the rest of our lives.

I did everything the doctors asked, fought through the pain, and on the day my vision finally returned, I ran back to the pack house, heart bursting with joy, eager to share the good news.

But the moment I opened the door, I was met with betrayal.

Corvin was in our bed, tangled with his secretary, Kelly. And in the heat of passion, the name he moaned wasn‚Äôt mine‚Äîit was hers. The Omega who‚Äôd only joined the pack six months ago.

‚ÄúAlpha,‚Äù Kelly murmured, fingers sliding down his throat with deliberate provocation, ‚Äúwhy not break the mating bond with your Luna? She‚Äôs blind. Useless to you now.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù Corvin rasped, voice thick with lust. ‚ÄúI need more time.‚Äù

That night, a storm swept through the Northern territories, blanketing the city in ice and snow. I caught the faintest trace of home on the wind‚Äîthe scent of my people calling me back.

By the time I booked a flight to the Snowlands, I‚Äôd made up my mind.

Corvin and the Darkmoon Pack would mean nothing to me from now on.

I stood outside the pack house in the blizzard for two full hours, letting the cold numb my skin, hoping they might rein themselves in. Foolishly, I thought they‚Äôd at least try to hide.

They didn‚Äôt.

When I stepped inside again, they had moved from the bedroom to the living room. The scent of their pheromones was heavy in the air, clinging to the walls like filth.

They clung to each other right in front of me‚Äîkissing, touching‚Äîlike I, their ‚Äúblind‚Äù Luna, didn‚Äôt even exist.

Corvin glanced at me for a brief second, a flicker of panic in his eyes, before Kelly‚Äôs kiss consumed him again.

‚ÄúShe can‚Äôt see us,‚Äù Kelly whispered with a smile, her voice like poisoned honey against his ear. Her eyes, though, were sharp blades aimed straight at me.

Corvin gave her a warning squeeze and muttered under his breath, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fuck around. If she finds out, we‚Äôll be in trouble.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs what makes it exciting,‚Äù Kelly said, loud enough for me to hear. Her fingers traced lazy circles on his chest. ‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôre out of condoms. You wanna grab them, or should she?‚Äù

She turned to me with a smile full of venom.

Corvin hesitated. Then he looked at me and said as casually as he could, ‚ÄúNora, my throat‚Äôs a little sore. Could you grab the meds off the coffee table?‚Äù

I stared at the lingering flush on his face. The hand that once promised to guide me through darkness was now wrapped around another Omega‚Äôs waist. I dug my nails into my palm to keep from trembling.

There were no meds on that table.

Just a box of condoms.

I picked it up and walked it over to him, my voice as even as I could manage. ‚ÄúIs it serious?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing much. Just need a pill,‚Äù he replied, avoiding my touch as he took the box from my hands. His fingers shook.

Kelly giggled, snug in his arms. ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äôs still such a gentleman‚Äîtaking care of his blind Luna and all.‚Äù

As they turned to head back into the bedroom, I heard her sneer under her breath, ‚ÄúLook at her, playing the helpless blind girl. Does she really think she can keep that Luna title forever?‚Äù

The door clicked shut behind them.

I closed my eyes, exhaled, and sent a mind link to the Elders of the North.

‚ÄúElder, I‚Äôm ready to return to the Snowlands and claim the White Wolf Totem.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù came the Elder‚Äôs reply, his voice carrying the signature frost of the Northern packs. ‚ÄúReturning means severing all ties with the South‚Äîincluding your bond with Corvin.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure.‚Äù The snow howled against the windows like an ancestral call. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve forgotten my pack, my bloodline, and even myself. It‚Äôs time I remembered who I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù The Elder‚Äôs tone softened. ‚ÄúSeven days from now. We‚Äôll meet at the Snowlands‚Äô border.‚Äù

Just then, Corvin stepped into the room.

His shirt hung open, his neck and chest littered with the raw red marks of an Alpha's bite‚Äîsigns of pleasure left behind when they are marking.

He didn‚Äôt bother to hide them.

Hey everyone! I'm a 21-year-old from the U.S. who's hoping to move to Latin America early next year. I just graduated from college and recently landed a remote job, so I‚Äôm planning to spend some time abroad in a place where I can work, learn, and grow.

This isn‚Äôt a vacation or a party trip. I‚Äôm hoping to slow down, connect with the community, and reset after a pretty intense few years. I‚Äôd love any recommendations you might have.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for: not expecting perfection, just hoping to get close:

* Somewhere near the beach, ideally with nearby nature or hiking
* Warm, sunny weather
* A town or city that‚Äôs walkable or scooter-friendly
* A peaceful vibe (I‚Äôm more of a coffee and early morning walk person than nightlife)
* Friendly locals and a strong sense of local culture, I‚Äôd love to get involved or volunteer in some way
* A few good places to work from (caf√©s, coworking spaces, etc.)
* A music scene would be amazing- I sing and play guitar and would love to join a jam night or open mic
* Some fellow remote workers would be nice, but not a tourist hotspot
* Cost of living that‚Äôs manageable on an early career remote salary

I really want to contribute to and learn from the local culture, while being respectful of the community and the pace of life there.

For context, I‚Äôve previously spent time in Quer√©taro, Mexico (study abroad, loved the people and energy), and Medell√≠n, Colombia (a short work trip, the mountains and weather were amazing). I also speak spanish and portuguese, so no problem there.

1mjy232,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInReviews/comments/1mjy232/does_the_drinkmate_lux_soda_maker_truly_carbonate/,Does the Drinkmate LUX Soda Maker Truly Carbonate Any Drink?,"Testing the DrinkMate 710-20-14Zx2-PP1 has been quite an adventure. This stainless steel sparkling beverage maker is not just an addition to my countertop for decoration‚Äîthough, let me say, its sleek silver finish and compact design make it look perfect next to my coffee maker. What really sets it apart from other soda makers is its unique flexibility. With patented Fizz Infuser technology, I found myself carbonating everything from fresh orange juice to yesterday‚Äôs flat cola. I even tried turning my leftover chardonnay into a sparkling treat‚Äîdon‚Äôt judge, it actually worked pretty well!  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Operating this manual carbonation machine was surprisingly simple, even for someone like me who usually struggles assembling techy kitchen gadgets. Unboxing it revealed a reusable dual-wall stainless steel bottle, a Fizz Infuser, and two sizable 60L CO2 cylinders. Just snap the carbonation bottle into place, press the lever down a few times, and voil√†‚Äîfizz magic. Cleaning it is straightforward, especially since the bottle is dishwasher-safe, which is a huge win. However, I did wish they included more detailed instructions for the first-timers among us. I had to check a few tutorial videos online just to confirm my moves weren‚Äôt about to cause a soda explosion.  

**Advantages**  
- Fizz Infuser allows carbonation for almost any drink.  
- Sleek and compact stainless steel design complements modern kitchens.  
- The insulated bottle keeps drinks cooler longer.  
- Eco-friendly with the reusable, dishwasher-safe carbonation bottle.  

[Check DrinkMate 710-20-14Zx2-PP1 price on Amazon.](https://appliancedirectory.com/p/b0dn1nvlk7/)

**Performance and Flexibility**  
What truly elevates the DrinkMate above other carbonation devices I‚Äôve tested is its versatility. Most soda makers focus exclusively on water, but this one didn‚Äôt hesitate when I wanted to play mad mixologist. Orange juice, cranberry spritzers, homemade gin and tonics‚Äîit tackled all of them with ease. I even re-carbonated some sparkling wine that had gone flat, and it actually restored the bubbles better than expected.  

I will note, though, that the fizz level varies depending on what you‚Äôre carbonating. For instance, thicker liquids like fresh-squeezed juice don‚Äôt achieve the same bubbly intensity as thinner drinks. It‚Äôs a small compromise to make for the creative control this gadget provides.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Learning curve for beginners.  
- Carbonation is less intense for thick beverages.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
This machine has some serious countertop appeal. The stainless steel construction doesn‚Äôt just look classy‚Äîit also adds durability. Even after all my tests, the unit‚Äôs exterior remains free of scratches and smudges, which surprised me. The dual-wall insulated bottle is another design perk. Whether I filled it with cold soda water or carbonated mocktails, the temperature stayed impressively chilly for hours. On the downside, the bottle capacity is only 0.7 liters, which means I have to refill it often during a party or larger family gatherings.

**Key Benefits**  
- Durable stainless steel body and accessories.  
- Compact design fits on small countertops.  
- Keeps drinks cold for longer.  

**Competing Products**  
In exploring alternatives, SodaStream‚Äôs popular machines came to mind. While SodaStream models focus heavily on carbonating water, they lack the flexibility to handle juices, wines, or cocktails without risking damage to the unit. The DrinkMate, by contrast, feels like the rebel of the carbonation world, breaking those boundaries. That said, SodaStream does edge out in terms of wider CO2 cartridge availability‚Äîfinding replacements for the DrinkMate‚Äôs cartridges locally required a bit more effort for me.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
For its price range, this device offers quite a lot. The inclusion of two 60L CO2 cylinders provides tremendous value; refills can last weeks, depending on use. In comparison with pricier competitors, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre getting innovative versatility at a fair cost here. This gadget isn‚Äôt just for soda drinkers; it opens up possibilities for all kinds of beverages. If you‚Äôre someone who loves experiments in the kitchen‚Äîor hosting unique dinner parties‚Äîthis will feel worth every penny.

Two days after she left, I was desperately scrolling through¬†[**best apps for relationship advice**](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)¬†when I discovered coto‚Äôs platform. I booked a private audio call session¬†[with tarot reader & astrologer Nidhi](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb), one of their[¬†**top astrology and tarot**¬†experts](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)¬†who specialized in¬†[**relationship compatibility**¬†and emotional healing](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)¬†through tarot.

I felt like a¬†[complete fraud logging into that video call](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb). I was a logical guy who¬†[solved problems with spreadsheets, not cosmic energy](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb). But logic hadn‚Äôt¬†[saved my relationship, and I was willing to try](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)¬†anything that might¬†[help me understand what went wrong](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb).

Nidhi,¬†[pulled The Tower card for my current situation¬†](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)‚Äî a structure being¬†[struck by lightning, people falling from its heights](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb). ‚ÄúYour old way of being is crumbling,‚Äù¬†[she explained with gentle compassion](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb). ‚Äú[The Lions Gate Portal approaching on August 8th will amplify this destruction, but it‚Äôs necessary for your growth.](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)‚Äù

Through¬†[coto‚Äôs¬†**accurate astrology predictions**](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb), Nidhi showed me how I‚Äôd¬†[inherited emotional patterns from my father¬†](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)‚Äî a good man who provided¬†[but never shared his inner world](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb). I was r[ecreating generational trauma](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb), treating love like a¬†[business transaction instead of an emotional exchange.](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)

‚Äú[You‚Äôve been living in your mind](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb),‚Äù Nidhi said gently, ‚Äúwhile your heart has been in solitary confinement.¬†[Amaya left because she was starving for emotional intimacy](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb), and you kept¬†[feeding her logic and solutions.](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)‚Äù

# Lions Gate Portal as My Cosmic Deadline

During that life-changing session,¬†[Nidhi explained why the approaching Lions Gate Portal](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)¬†was exactly what¬†[I needed for emotional transformation](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb). ‚ÄúThis¬†[cosmic event creates the most powerful energy](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)¬†all year for¬†[**heart chakra activation**¬†and breaking through emotional barriers](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb),‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúThe¬†[portal opens when Sirius aligns with our Sun in Leo](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb), amplifying¬†[love consciousness and authentic self-expression](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb).

I learned that¬†[Lions Gate Portal occurs annually from August 1st through 12th](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb), with peak¬†[transformational energy on August 8th](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb). Ancient civilizations¬†[revered this cosmic alignment for its power to activate](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)¬†the heart center and dissolve emotional blocks that prevent authentic love.

Through coto‚Äôs¬†[**daily astrology guidance**](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb), Nidhi became my Lions Gate Portal coach,¬†[providing¬†**daily horoscope**¬†updates specifically focused on my emotional healing journey](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb).

The¬†[Lions Gate Portal became my deadline](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)¬†for becoming the man Amaya deserved ‚Äî not through force or desperation, but through¬†[genuine transformation supported by cosmic timing](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb). I had three weeks to¬†[learn emotional availability, and the universe was offering me the most powerful energy of the year](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb)¬†to make it happen.

# The Two of Cups: Lions Gate Portal Reunion

# Our Cosmic Coffee Shop Conversation

We met at the¬†[coffee shop where we‚Äôd had our first date](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb).

‚ÄúI was terrified of¬†[being vulnerable because I thought it would make you lose respect for me](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb),‚Äù I admitted, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúI realize¬†[now that my emotional unavailability was what made me unworthy of your love](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb).

Amaya reached across the table and touched my hand. ‚Äú[This is what I needed](https://app.coto.world/I6Knpa6yDVb),‚Äù she whispered. ‚Äú[Not perfection.

I'm dyslexic so I will go back and do minor grammar stuff later I'm mainly looking for critiques on the content of the story, premise, and structure. Like does the time jump make sense? Although glaring grammar and spelling errors pointed out would be appreciated.)



When I was a teenage girl I‚Äôd go wandering. There was fuck all else to do as I lived in a very boring part of suburban London that bordered on Kent. Which meant, all that surrounded me were empty fallow fields and decaying town centres. I spent most of my time in the former as, firstly I never had any money and secondly I‚Äôd get in trouble for smoking my mother‚Äôs stolen cigarettes in the local shopping centre. So I opted for the more private and picturesque option of smoking in the local woods on the south side of a set of train tracks. I liked to wander along them, watching the train go by, taking in long drags of my one, or sometimes two if I was feeling decadent, cigarettes. 



You had to climb over a fence to get into the woods by the train tracks. It was inconvenient but I was glad no smaller children could go wandering in. And it had the added effect that I rarely, if ever, saw another person. It was nice to be alone sometimes. However, the occasional group of other teenagers did walk past. But they paid me attention and I paid them no mind in return. 



Being the edgy teen I was, I'd sit and sketch the scenery, secretly hoping some pretty girl, a fellow outcast wandering around with no friends and nothing better to do, would come and ask me what I was drawing. And I‚Äôd show her my sketch of what was north of the tracks and she‚Äôd look at me in awe. My sketch book was filled with pictures of the beautiful Tudor manor house and its myriad of expertly kept gardens on the other side of the tracks. I‚Äôd draw the building from different angles imagining characters inside of it. Sometimes I‚Äôd draw ladies in the windows, children in the gardens, the lord of the manor staring out at me disapprovingly. 



One night I decided to check out what the place looked like after dark. After I made sure no security guards were lurking, I shimmed over the fence and dropped down on the floor side. The woods felt very different at night, it was the perfect mix of creepy and peaceful. I liked the dark. I found it comforting. It was like a big blanket I could hide from the world in. Feeling the rough familiar bark dig into my hands, I climbed up my favourite tree and positioned myself with a good view of the passing trains and the manor house. I also had an excellent view of the stars and it was the perfect clear and cool summer night to enjoy them. The moon was bright and beautiful too, but she always is. 



I was half way through my first cigarette when I first heard the faint sound of crying. Obviously it sent a shiver down my spine. Of course I‚Äôd heard the rumours about the place being haunted. Everyone says every woods is haunted, everyone says every train track is haunted and everyone says every old creepy manor house is haunted. So I brushed all the claims off as ridiculous. Even though I am a firm believer in ghosts and everything supernatural. 



I decided my best bet was to stay very still and hope the sound would go away. It didn‚Äôt. I figured my best shot was to run. I scrambled down the tree as silently as I could, landing with a soft thud on the ground. Before I turned to run I decided I‚Äôd get a look at where the sound was coming from. In case rather than being an evil human mimicking demon or goblin, it was a young woman in distress. 



Sure enough standing on the tracks facing away from me in the direction of where the train would come, was a girl about my age. She wore an incredibly cool vintage knee length dress in green tartan. I was already in love and incredibly jealous. 

‚ÄúHi!‚Äù I called out to her. She whipped her head around to look at me. Her face was small, pale and tear stained. ‚ÄúGet off the tracks, the train will be here in a minute!‚Äù

‚ÄúGood!‚Äù She yelled bursting into tears. 

‚ÄúI understand the wanting to kill yourself thing but do you fancy a smoke first?‚Äù That night I had taken three cigarettes as I considered my first night time solo adventure to be a big event. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù The girl shook her head. 

‚ÄúWhy? Scared you‚Äôll get cancer. Didn‚Äôt think you were scared of death.‚Äù 

She gave me a sweet smile and then said: ‚ÄúOh go on then.‚Äù And hopped off the tracks. 



She looked me up and down curiously before she asked. ‚ÄúWhy are you dressed like a sailor?‚Äù

I looked down at my outfit. My jeans and jumper did look a bit nautical. I shrugged off her comment with a smile and lit us a cigarette to share. I took one drag and then handed it to her. 



Suddenly, as she took it from my hand, a train whizzed past us. She looked at it with wide eyes as if the reality of what she was about to do to herself finally dawned on her.

‚ÄúGosh.‚Äù She laughed awkwardly. ‚ÄúQuite glad I changed my mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat made you want to do it anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I can‚Äôt spend one more day in that horrid place.‚Äù She pointed to the manor house. She took a drag from the cigarette, her technique was completely off and she coughed a little as the smoke came out of her mouth. 

‚ÄúYou live there!‚Äù I exclaimed. ‚ÄúBloody hell what does your Dad do for a living?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy father is a Psychiatrist. And no I don‚Äôt really live there. It‚Äôs a school.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. And a terrible one at that.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it a posh school?‚Äù I asked 

‚ÄúTerribly so.‚Äù She nodded looking down at the floor. 

‚ÄúSo I guess the girls are all stuck up bitches.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo is that why you wanted to end it. You wanted the bullying to stop?‚Äù

The girl nodded. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù She asked me. 

‚ÄúC.J.‚Äù

‚ÄúMines Julia.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou hang out here a lot?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúEver seen these woods?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCome on, there‚Äôs a tree with a rope on it over that way. Oh lets go start a fire.‚Äù I said enthusiastically beckoning her to follow me.

She giggled running after me. ‚ÄúIs arson a hobby of yours?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah. What about you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you have any hobbies?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I write poems.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh cool! I draw sometimes.‚Äù I flicked open my notebook and handed it to her. 

‚ÄúThese are great. You have a real talent C.J.‚Äù She smiled, handing my book back to me. 

I put the book back into my backpack, then I turned to her. ‚ÄúWish I was talented at something worth while, like maths or science. Can‚Äôt do much with an art degree.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes you can. You can make art.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like food too much to be a starving artist.‚Äù 

 

I showed her the rope swing and we started a fire nearby for some light. Eventually our conversation devolved into everything horrible that had ever happened to us, as is usual when young girls get together. 



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a girl in my year her name‚Äôs Millicent. And we were best friends for years. About two weeks ago the two of us were sitting alone in the gardens and well, here‚Äôs the kicker, she kissed me! It was a good kiss and I was y‚Äôknow basking in the moment secretly thinking about the great poems I was going to write later. When suddenly who appears but Cynthia. Who has hated me from the day she met me in the first week of first year. She does the most overdramatic scream I have ever heard then-‚Äù She wiped a tear from her face. ‚ÄúThen Millicent pushes me away and acts as if I kissed her! But not only that, she acts as if I‚Äôm some sort of predator and runs off with Cynthia. They go back to the dormitories and tell everyone how I‚Äôm depraved and dangerous.‚Äù She looked off into the fire and put her arms around herself. 

‚ÄúY‚Äôknow I got bullied for being a lesbo even though I‚Äôve never actually kissed a girl.‚Äù

She looked at me confused. ‚ÄúThen how did they know?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a lucky guess on their part. Having short hair and a nickname C.J probably doesn't help.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHave you ever tried to kill yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. But I‚Äôve thought about it. But then I think I‚Äôll be an adult soon enough and then I can leave and go somewhere cool for uni like Leeds or Brighton and I‚Äôll forget all about this stupid town.‚Äù



My words made Julia go quiet and I wondered if I had upset her. She took a moment to think as she stared into the fire before she nodded to herself and then looked at me with a watery eyed smile. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever met anyone like you before.‚Äù She said. 

‚ÄúSame.‚Äù 

Slowly a provocative smile crept along her face. ‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôve never kissed a girl.‚Äù

‚ÄúYep.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you like to?‚Äù



I gave a wide smile and nodded enthusiastically. Julia placed her arms around me and leaned in to kiss me. Our lips met. It was like a chemical bomb of endorphins went on in my head and my heart. I imagined the neurons in my brain firing away carving out the brain paths built in in my creation that had never been treaded before. I imagined the neural electricity was the colour of rainbows sparking and whizzing around like fireworks. 



Suddenly, I felt a cold breeze pass my face and my hand was no longer full of Julia‚Äôs soft hair. I opened my eyes. Instead of a beautiful girl in front of me there was the darkness of the night and eerie silence of the woods punctuated by the crackle of a dying fire. I called Julia‚Äôs name but there was no reply. The night suddenly felt very dark and oh so quiet. I wondered if she was playing a prank on me and I continued to search for her and call her name. But she truly had disappeared. 



My entire body came out in goosebumps.The cool summer night breeze suddenly felt more like a chill crawling up my spine. I ran out of the woods. When I reached the metal fence, I hauled myself over it. Then hurriedly I sped walked along the street lamp lit roads until I reached home. I never told anyone about Julia aside from a few drunken uni friends on Halloween once. But I see her in my dreams sometimes. 



She came back into the forefront of my mind recently because, finally having the twelve pounds to spend on a ticket inside, I went to the manor house. It was certainly interesting being on the right side of the tracks for a change. The area was far nicer than on the side I grew up on. As I have a tendency to get bored reading the plaques in museums, I decided to follow the tour. 

‚ÄúAnd in 1947 the building was repurposed as a small girls school catering to the growing suburban middle class with their London money.‚Äù The chirpy twenty something tour guide said as she fiddled with her staff lanyard. She pointed to a wall lined with pictures of teenage girls in rows in school uniform. ‚ÄúHere are the pictures of each graduating class up until the school closed in the 70‚Äôs, you can see there are only about twenty in each year.‚Äù Then she stepped over to another part of the room. ‚ÄúOver on this wall is an exhibit on a tragedy that occurred here in the fifties made by a few students at the local university, doing their project on LGBT history in the local area.‚Äù 



The tour guide began to tell the story but I didn‚Äôt listen. Instead my jaw dropped at the sight of the wall. There at the centre of this exhibition was a picture of a girl I knew with a small pale face and kind eyes. Julia. I saw her entire short and tragic life displayed in glass frames. Her diary entries, the newspaper clippings entitled things like ‚ÄúLocal girl throws herself in front of train. Family devastated.‚Äù, I saw her poems from English class which were beautiful but filled with yearning and tragedy. There were pictures of her as a little child, with her family, and some at the age I knew her. Her smile faded over time as she got closer and closer to the age she was when she threw herself in front of a train to escape the cruelty of the world around her. 



Something about this felt wrong. To have a child‚Äôs life on display to be gawked at. As if Julia were an exhibit, a specimen, a subject to be studied rather than a human being and a child at that. These were things she never intended anyone else to see and no tens of strangers passed casually by her story every day for the price of two overpriced coffees. As I stared scowling lost in my thoughts I felt someone bump into me. 



‚ÄúExcuse me. Thank you.‚Äù A tall young person with one of those pins kids wear these days that say ‚ÄúThey/Them‚Äù and that make old people irrationally angry in a way I find delightfully funny, scooted past me. They were holding the hand of a young girl with glasses and a very cool houndstooth blazer. In a flurry of giggles and leaving the heavy nostalgic scent of cheap body spray and superdrug makeup, they brushed past me. 



‚ÄúThis is what I wanted to show you.‚Äù The tall teen with the ‚ÄúThey/Them‚Äù badge pointed at the display before putting their arm around the girl. She looked over the display in awe and her hand lingered over one of Julia‚Äôs poems. There was a look of fierce determination in her eyes as well as sorrow as she read the words. 

‚ÄúI wish I could write like that.‚Äù She mumbled. 

‚ÄúWell she was like a year older than you, she had more practice. If you start now I bet you can be just as good as her.‚Äù The teenager smiled encouragingly at their girlfriend and they shared a short sweet kiss before continuing to read through the pages of Julia‚Äôs life. 



That night I went and waited for Julia by the tracks. I even smoked a cigarette for old times sake, something I hadn‚Äôt done since I was a teenager. She didn‚Äôt appear. She stayed dissipated in the ether, refusing to materialise. All I had left of her that wasn‚Äôt on display was the sparkly electric she sent soaring through me when she kissed me that I had spent my life searching for again. I decided her disappearance was a good thing. Even if I missed her terribly. Everyone deserves to rest in peace, even broken little girls with pain embedded into their pale souls that will follow them into the next life. ",1,1754567278.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1
Blair‚Äôs POV

I‚Äôve been Christian‚Äôs Luna for five years.

But he never marked me. Never sealed the mate bond with me.

Every time I brought it up, he‚Äôd brush me off with a smile. ‚ÄúBlair, I‚Äôm too busy. Pack matters are piling up. Sealing the mate bond? What difference does it make?‚Äù

And I believed him. I always did. Until today.

I saw it with my own eyes‚ÄîChristian, standing before the pack elders, sealing the mate bond‚Ä¶ with my twin sister Carrie, the one who vanished five years ago.

In that moment, my wolf let out a low, guttural growl inside me, her claws tearing at my heart.

Carrie‚Äôs eyes were red with tears as she threw herself into his arms, gripping the bond-sealing contract tightly.

‚ÄúChristian, it was my fault‚Ä¶ I left you at the altar‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice trembled. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre only agreeing to this because I have cancer. But I still have to ask‚Äîafter all these years, did you ever forget me? Did you actually fall in love with Blair?‚Äù

He was silent for what felt like a century.

I stood nearby, my nails digging deep into my palms. Blood trickled down my fingers. Even my wolf was trembling.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he finally said, voice cold as a winter frost. ‚ÄúNever.‚Äù

Carrie instantly broke into tears of joy. She rose on tiptoe and kissed him.

And him‚Ä¶ his hand hovered for a moment‚Äîthen settled on her waist, deepening the kiss.

‚ÄúNo‚Äî!‚Äù

My wolf let out a furious roar. A violent storm surged through my veins. My fingertips went numb, my bones tensing until I could feel my claws threatening to break through skin.

But none of them looked my way. Not even once.

Beeeeeeep‚Äî

A car horn blared, sharp and sudden. I jerked my head up.

Three black Maybachs pulled up nearby. Out stepped the three Alphas of the Bloodstone Pack‚Äîmy three older brothers: Lysander, Orion, and Zayden.

‚ÄúThe bond-sealing deal‚Äôs signed? Mate bond sealed too?‚Äù Zayden clapped his hands. ‚ÄúGreat. Restaurant‚Äôs booked. Let‚Äôs go celebrate.‚Äù

Cold seeping into my bones like I'd been thrown into an Arctic sea.

These were the same brothers who made me breakfast this morning with their own hands.

Carrie sobbed as she ran into their arms, like a little girl finally returning home. ‚ÄúI thought‚Ä¶ I thought you all didn‚Äôt want me anymore‚Ä¶‚Äù

The three of them exchanged glances, their expressions complicated. In the end, Zayden reached out and ruffled her hair, tone indulgent like always. ‚ÄúSilly girl. You‚Äôve been causing trouble since you were little. When have we not cleaned up your mess?‚Äù

Carrie wiped her tears away and looped her arms through theirs like it was second nature. The four of them walked into the cars, all smiles and laughter.

Not one of them looked back at me.

Only when their cars disappeared from view did I finally collapse against a tree‚Äîlike my heart had just been ripped out.

The bark scraped my skin, but that pain was nothing compared to the way my heart had been torn wide open.

Carrie was always the one everyone adored. Ever since we were kids.

We were twins‚Äîbut we were never equals.

When I had a fever, my brothers took her to the amusement park. When I spent my birthday alone, she got gifts from the entire pack with my brothers at her side.

I crushed on Christian for ten years‚Äîhe was my fated mate‚Äîbut one look from her, and he rejected me and kissed her hand instead.

I thought it was my fate‚Äîto be unloved, to be the forgotten placeholder.

Until she ran away from her own wedding.

Wearing a million-dollar gown, she eloped with an Omega and dragged two packs through the mud.

That night, my brothers announced I was their only sister from then on.

And that same night, Christian stumbled drunk into my room.

He pinned me against the wall, twirling my damp hair around his fingers, eyes hazy.

‚ÄúYou look just like her‚Ä¶‚Äù

Then he pulled out the wedding ring meant for Carrie‚Ä¶ and slipped it onto my finger.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gone. So‚Ä¶ be my Luna. You‚Äôre my mate anyway, right?‚Äù

I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have said yes. But I loved him too much. For far too long.

For five years, he treated me like royalty.

Sapphires, Eiffel Tower dates, diamonds, candlelit banquets‚Äîanything I so much as glanced at, he‚Äôd have it procured and laid at my feet.

Whenever I had nightmares, he‚Äôd drop everything and hold me close, whispering comfort in my ear.

Even my brothers changed. It was like Carrie never existed.

I thought, maybe‚Ä¶ maybe I finally had love that belonged to me.

But Carrie came back.

And all that love began to recede like the tide, pulling me away one inch at a time.

I watched the Maybachs disappear, and I couldn‚Äôt hold it in anymore‚ÄîI laughed.

At first, it was low and shaky. Then it grew louder, sharper, uncontrollable. I doubled over, laughing until tears mixed with blood fell to the ground.

Passersby stared. No one came near.

They didn‚Äôt understand‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt crazy. My heart had simply been chewed up and spit out.

Turns out, these past few years‚ÄîI was just a thief.

I stole her love, her title, and even her Alpha.

And now she was back.

Which meant I, the substitute, had to step aside.

I wiped my tears and straightened up. My wolf howled inside me, raging, tearing apart every last trace of soft illusions.

‚ÄúIf all of you‚Ä¶ only ever loved her‚Ä¶‚Äù

I spat each word like venom, ‚ÄúThen I don‚Äôt want any of you either.‚Äù

I raised my hand and flagged down a cab.

Half an hour later, I pushed open a heavy door and walked up to the front desk.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to buy an uninhabited island.‚Äù

The receptionist froze, stunned. Then quickly called for the owner.

He was in his forties, sharp and cautious. ‚ÄúLuna, the island you chose has no signal, no route access. Supply boats only visit every three months. Once you‚Äôre there, you‚Äôll be completely cut off. Are you sure?‚Äù

I looked him dead in the eye, gaze as cold and wild as a feral beast.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure.‚Äù

Chapter 2
Blair‚Äôs POV

The shop owner glanced at my red-rimmed eyes but thought better than to ask.

He quickly sorted through the documents, speaking respectfully. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll finalize the paperwork as soon as possible. Once everything‚Äôs ready, we‚Äôll notify you immediately about the departure to the island.‚Äù

Without hesitation, I signed my name and pulled a black card from my wallet. My movements were sharp and decisive. As the payment went through, my hand didn‚Äôt tremble in the slightest‚Äîlike the wolf inside me had already stopped struggling and turned to ice.

Outside, darkness had swallowed the sky. The clouds hung low, and the air carried the metallic tang of a gathering storm.

Back at the pack house, I stepped into the foyer‚Äîonly to be hit with the warm glow of lights‚Ä¶ and the sound of familiar, yet foreign, laughter.

My pupils constricted.

Christian was sitting on the couch, smiling as he peeled an apple for Carrie. His fingers were long and graceful, moving with the precision of someone sculpting a lover‚Äôs statue. My three brothers were sitting nearby, loyal guards standing watch.

‚ÄúCarrie,‚Äù Orion coaxed gently, ‚Äútake the medicine.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so bitter‚Ä¶‚Äù Carrie whined, her voice all sweet and delicate.

Zayden immediately pulled out a piece of chocolate from his pocket. ‚ÄúThis was your favorite as a kid. I always keep one on me.‚Äù

I stood frozen at the doorway, my fingertips digging hard into my palm. Blood slowly seeped out‚Äîbut I felt nothing.

‚ÄúBlair?‚Äù Christian was the first to notice me. He got up and walked toward me. ‚ÄúWhere were you all day? I didn‚Äôt see you once.‚Äù

His voice was soft. Like he wasn‚Äôt the same man who stood right in front of me earlier‚Äîsealing the mate bond with Carrie.

I didn‚Äôt answer. My gaze slid past him and landed on Carrie‚Äîthe sister who‚Äôd once run away from her wedding and shattered my entire life.

Christian followed my eyes, then offered a quiet explanation. ‚ÄúCarrie‚Äôs sick. Terminal. She just wants to spend her last days with family. I know she was wrong to run back then, but she‚Äôs still your sister. For your sake‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúFor my sake?‚Äù I let out a laugh, cold and low. My voice rumbled into a growl. ‚ÄúOr is it because you never actually let her go?‚Äù

His expression darkened. ‚ÄúBlair‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBlair.‚Äù Lysander‚Äîmy eldest brother‚Äîstepped up. He reached for my head out of habit but froze mid-air, changing the gesture into a pat on my shoulder. ‚ÄúCarrie doesn‚Äôt have much time left. It‚Äôs not like our pack can‚Äôt afford to take care of one more person‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Orion chimed in, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been through a lot out there. She knows she messed up. But we‚Äôre family.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the sensible one, right?‚Äù Zayden said from behind me, voice laced with pressure.

I clenched my jaw. My wolf snarled inside me, thrashing, ready to tear everything apart‚Äîbut there was no outlet for her rage.

Finally, I muttered, ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

Finally, satisfied smiles spread across their faces.

‚ÄúKeep Carrie company,‚Äù Christian said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go prepare a room for her.‚Äù

After they went upstairs, Carrie slowly rose from the couch and walked over. Her face looked pale, but the gleam in her eyes betrayed her delight.

‚ÄúBlair, it‚Äôs been five years. I brought you a little gift.‚Äù

I instinctively took a step back. Every instinct screamed that something was wrong.

She smiled sweetly as she shoved a box wrapped in black ribbon into my arms‚Äîthen, ever so thoughtfully, lifted the lid.

‚ÄúAH‚Äî!‚Äù

A pitch-black snake shot out of the box and sank its fangs deep into my wrist.

The pain hit me like lightning, tearing straight through nerves and bone. I almost screamed.

I flung the box away in pure panic‚Äîhitting her square in the shoulder.

She dropped to the floor with a dramatic shriek. ‚ÄúOw! It hurts!‚Äù

Thundering footsteps echoed from upstairs. All four men rushed down‚Äîonly to see Carrie on the ground in tears, and me, standing in a pool of blood, venom dripping from my wrist.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?!‚Äù Christian roared, shoving me aside.

I stumbled, crashing into the coffee table. Something in my ribcage cracked.

‚ÄúShe put a snake in the box...‚Äù I rasped, voice barely audible.

‚ÄúBullshit!‚Äù Zayden‚Äôs roar made my ears ring. ‚ÄúCarrie‚Äôs body is too weak‚Äîhow the hell could she hurt you?!‚Äù

‚ÄúChristian‚Ä¶ Orion‚Ä¶ please... I just wanted to make peace with Blair,‚Äù Carrie sobbed, crawling into Orion‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why she misunderstood me like this‚Ä¶‚Äù

Cold seeped into every inch of my body. I tried to reach for the box‚Äîto prove I wasn‚Äôt lying‚Äîbut Christian gripped my injured wrist and yanked me back.

‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù he snapped, hurling me aside. The twin puncture marks on my wrist were clear as day. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs your sister! And you would pull a stunt like this?!‚Äù

They scooped Carrie into their arms and left‚Äîwithout once looking back.

I collapsed to my knees‚Äîthe venom spread fast, my vision blurred and my ears buzzed like bees trapped in my skull. Something inside me was screaming.

‚ÄúLuna! Luna!‚Äù I barely made out Lexie‚Äôs voice‚Äîthe maid of the packhouse in charge of cleaning.

I forced my eyes open, but everything was a blur. I could only see the ceiling.

They rushed me to the hospital. But what I heard next‚Äî

‚ÄúSorry, all the pack doctors are treating Carrie. Her condition suddenly worsened. Orders are in‚Äîonly she gets care today.‚Äù

I laughed‚Äîa broken, blood-choked sound, a wolf‚Äôs howl dying somewhere deep in my throat.

Lexie screamed through tears, ‚ÄúLuna‚Äôs dying! If you let her die, I swear I‚Äôll report you to the Alpha Council!‚Äù

No one listened.

I fumbled for my phone and called Christian. My voice was barely a whisper.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ got bitten by a venomous snake‚Ä¶ can your pack‚Ä¶ send a healer‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBlair!‚Äù His voice on the other end was glacial. ‚ÄúCarrie‚Äôs condition worsened after you pushed her! And you‚Äôre still playing games?!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me‚Ä¶ I swear‚Ä¶‚Äù

Click. He hung up.

I stared at the screen, stunned. Tears slid silently down my face. Pain‚Äîsharp, burning pain‚Äîripped through every inch of my body. But worse than that‚Ä¶ was the ache in my heart.

My wolf howled inside me, but no one answered.

I slowly closed my eyes. And wished I could disappear‚Äîforever.

Chapter 3
Blair‚Äôs POV

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled my nose as I opened my eyes. It burned all the way to my scalp.

‚ÄúLuna! You‚Äôre finally awake!‚Äù Lexie threw herself to my bedside, eyes swollen, gripping my cold fingers like they were her lifeline. Her hands were rough‚Äîbut somehow, they carried a warmth I‚Äôd almost forgotten.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù My throat felt torn to shreds. I could barely speak. ‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶ did I survive?‚Äù

Tears spilled from her eyes again. ‚ÄúA kind-hearted healer. He was just visiting our pack and happened to see the snake that bit you. He went to the infirmary, realized you were poisoned, and‚Ä¶ he couldn‚Äôt just stand by.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe risked being punished and injected you with antivenom in secret. He said‚Ä¶ if it had been ten minutes later, you wouldn‚Äôt have made it.‚Äù

My heart gave a jolt.

‚ÄúI begged Alpha Lysander to believe you‚Äôd been bitten,‚Äù Lexie choked out, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúHe said you were faking it. Alpha Orion refused to even see me. And Alpha Zayden‚Ä¶ he said you deserved it.‚Äù

I clenched the blanket, nails digging into my palm‚Äîyet I felt no pain.

‚ÄúAlpha Christian was the worst!‚Äù she nearly sobbed. ‚ÄúI got on my knees and begged him to come check on you. He said‚Ä¶ said you were just being dramatic again. Said I was helping you put on a show.‚Äù

Lexie held my hand like it was the only thing keeping her grounded. ‚ÄúLuna, you were always so good to them. Last winter, Alpha Lysander came home drunk after a late-night pack summit‚Äîyou boiled him a bitter tonic in the freezing kitchen and caught a cold yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen Alpha Orion got into gambling trouble, you secretly sold your grandmother‚Äôs heirloom to pay off his debts. When Zayden had a fever for three days straight, you stayed by his side until you passed out.‚Äù

She couldn‚Äôt continue, tears choking her voice. ‚ÄúAnd Alpha Christian‚Ä¶ the coffee beans he likes, the brand of ties he wears‚Äîthings even his mother can‚Äôt remember. You remembered everything. And now, they‚Äôre all fawning over Carrie. That sister who bullied you your whole life, the one who ran from her wedding like a coward‚Äînow she‚Äôs the adored Luna?!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say a word.

Tears streamed down my cheeks, soaking the pillow beneath me. They burned like acid, each drop cutting deeper than the last.

But none of that compared to the pain in my chest.

It didn‚Äôt matter. It would all be over soon.

I‚Äôd already signed the paperwork for the island. A place far from the mainland.

No betrayal. No lies. No them.

Two days later, I returned ‚Äúhome.‚Äù

The moment I pushed open the door, I was ambushed by a blast of birthday music‚Äîpiercing, clawing at my eardrums, tangled with laughter and the clink of champagne glasses.

Under the crystal chandelier, Carrie stood by the cake in a flowing gown, her smile radiant. My three brothers and Christian surrounded her.

The scene was so familiar, it made my stomach turn.

I stood there at the entrance. The air hung heavy and still.

‚ÄúI thought she was supposed to be dying?‚Äù Lysander shot me a cold, cutting glare from behind his glasses.

Orion took a sip of wine, brows furrowed. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt have long to live. Can‚Äôt you cut her some slack?‚Äù

Zayden snorted. ‚ÄúSame old drama. Can‚Äôt she come up with a new act?‚Äù

Christian walked toward me, that ever-so-gentle fa√ßade still in place. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre upset about my past with Carrie,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you have to understand‚Äîmy Luna, my wife now, is you.‚Äù

Luna? Wife?

A loud crack exploded in my head.

I stood by his side through ruin and disaster. Through every storm and sleepless night. I gave him everything.

And now‚Äîthe one who sealed the mate bond with him, the one who was marked by him‚Ä¶ was Carrie.

So this‚Ä¶ this is what they called a ‚Äúfated mate‚Äù?

I stared at him, laughing coldly. Even the way my lips curved felt like someone else‚Äôs. My heart had been torn apart‚Äîbut I wasn‚Äôt afraid anymore. My blood was boiling. My wolf was awakening.

Then Carrie‚Äôs voice rang out, bright and sweet. ‚ÄúChristian, Lysander, Orion, Zayden‚Äîcome cut the cake with me!‚Äù

The big screen lit up. It started off with well-wishes from guests. But just as everyone began to wonder what came next‚Äîthe screen abruptly changed.

Nude photos of Carrie with a young Omega flashed before the entire pack.

‚ÄúA birthday gift for you.‚Äù

The blood-red words burned into her soul‚Äîmy answer, carved in flame.

‚ÄúTurn it off! Now!‚Äù Lysander roared.

Orion ripped the power cord from the wall. Zayden tore through the crowd like a madman, snatching guests‚Äô phones.

Carrie stumbled back, pale as a corpse. ‚ÄúYou already stole their love‚Ä¶ Why are you humiliating me too?!‚Äù

Then she collapsed to the floor, sobbing like her world had ended. Christian rushed to scoop her up, his face full of panic.

‚ÄúCall the healer! Now!‚Äù

Before he carried her off, he looked back at me. That look‚Ä¶ As if he didn‚Äôt know who I was.

Lysander grabbed my arm, voice like rolling thunder. ‚ÄúBlair, look at what you‚Äôve done!‚Äù

I gasped, trying to hold it together. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúStill lying?‚Äù Orion sneered. ‚ÄúIn the Bloodstone Pack, mistakes are punished.‚Äù

Punished?

I froze.

When I was twelve, Carrie pushed me down the stairs‚Äîit was my fault for being clumsy.

At eighteen, she ruined my birthday cake‚Äîthey said she was just joking.

That winter, she locked me outside on the balcony‚ÄîI almost froze to death. They said she was just in a bad mood.

And now‚Äîthey wanted to punish me?

Chapter 4
Blair‚Äôs POV

‚ÄúKneel.‚Äù

Zayden‚Äôs voice cut through me, cold and sharp as a winter wind, leaving my dignity in shreds.

Two towering warriors lunged forward, grabbing my shoulders with brutal force, like I was some kind of prisoner.

I fought instinctively‚Äîmy wolf refused to bow‚Äîbut they were too strong. They slammed me down onto the cold stone floor.

My knees crashed against the ground as pain shooting straight through my bones, and the world blurred for a moment.

Lysander raised the vine whip he‚Äôd prepared. It sliced through the air with a shriek. A heartbeat later‚Äî

Crack!

Agony ripped across my back like lightning. I bit down hard on my lip, tasting blood, but refused to make a sound.

My wolf raged inside me‚Äîfurious, rebellious‚Äîbut I forced her down with sheer willpower.

‚ÄúDo you admit your mistake?‚Äù Lysander‚Äôs voice was ice.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything wrong‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice was hoarse, each word like glass in my throat.

Crack!

This one was worse. The whip tore through the thin fabric of my dress, burning straight into my flesh. Wet heat spread across my back‚ÄîI was bleeding.

I knew that pain. That wasn‚Äôt an ordinary whip. It was a silver-threaded wolf whip, made specifically to punish those who defy the Alpha.

‚ÄúDo you admit your mistake?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

Again. And again. Each lash meant to break me‚Äînot just my body, but my soul.

Blood mixed with the howls of my wolf, roaring inside me. I stayed silent, biting down until I tasted copper. My white dress was soaked in crimson, the floor beneath me painted in a grotesque pattern of red.

‚ÄúStop! Please‚Äîstop!‚Äù

Lexie, the aging maid, fell to her knees, sobbing. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to die! Luna‚Äôs going to die if you keep going!‚Äù

But my three brothers didn‚Äôt flinch. Didn‚Äôt pause. They acted like they couldn‚Äôt hear her‚Äîlike I wasn‚Äôt even human.

My vision dimmed. The edges of the world crumbled. All I could hear was Zayden‚Äôs mocking voice, ‚ÄúIf she won‚Äôt admit it, then we‚Äôll beat her until she does.‚Äù

The last lash fell‚Äîand with it, my consciousness. Darkness swallowed me whole.

And the last thing I saw‚Ä¶ was my blood pooling on the ground, and the cold, merciless eyes of the three men who used to be my family.

They were once my brothers. My protectors. My blood. Now? They were the ones holding the blade.

I was locked in a room for three full days with no visitors and no one even brought me water.

My wounds had festered, the silver threads still burning beneath my skin. I curled up on the bed like a dying animal, clinging to life by a thread.

And next door? A different world entirely.

Carrie‚Äôs voice drifted through the wall, soft and sweet. My brothers whispering back to her, comforting her. Even Christian‚Äôs low laugh echoed in. Each sound cut deep, flaying my heart raw.

‚ÄúCarrie, take your medicine.‚Äù

‚ÄúNooo, it‚Äôs so bitter‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBe good. Finish it and I‚Äôll give you candy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen Christian, you feed me‚Ä¶‚Äù

I buried my face in the pillow, my nails digging into my palms. Wolves heal fast‚Äîbut not from betrayal.

I thought I was numb. But every breath still stabbed at my chest.

On the fourth morning, I finally managed to stand. Leaning on the wall, I dragged myself to the staircase‚Äîand that‚Äôs when I heard it.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôve been dolphins near the coast lately,‚Äù Christian said, a rare note of excitement in his voice. ‚ÄúCarrie‚Äôs always wanted to see them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs go today,‚Äù the three brothers chimed in.

I froze. My fingers trembled against the railing.

My wounds hadn‚Äôt even closed. Every step felt like knives slicing through my back.

‚ÄúBlair?‚Äù Carrie looked up and gasped. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre finally out of bed!‚Äù

All four men turned to me. Their eyes‚Ä¶ it was like I was a stranger.

I was nothing but skin and bone, the loose nightgown hanging off me like a sheet while bruises covered my wrists like broken jewelry.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre heading out to see the dolphins,‚Äù Carrie said, rushing over and clinging to my arm like we were best friends. ‚ÄúYou should come too!‚Äù

I pulled away without thinking. Tears instantly welled in her eyes.

‚ÄúBlair, I already forgave you,‚Äù she said, choking up. ‚ÄúEven after you ruined my reputation‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to hold grudges. I don‚Äôt have much time left‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBlair!‚Äù Christian stormed over and shielded her with his body. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs offering you peace, and this is how you respond?‚Äù

Zayden scoffed. ‚ÄúLook at Carrie, then look at you. It‚Äôs not even close.‚Äù

I bit down on my lip until I tasted blood again.

These men‚Äîonce the ones closest to me‚Äîwere now more distant than strangers.

They brought me on the yacht, saying it was to make Carrie happy.

The sun blazed down on the deck, so bright I could barely keep my eyes open.

Carrie giggled, suggesting a barbecue.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm dying soon‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt I at least do what I want?‚Äù she murmured, voice soft as silk.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk nonsense!‚Äù Orion quickly covered her mouth. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve found the best healer in the entire werewolf realm. You‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

I sat quietly in the corner, watching them fawn over her like she was the only one who mattered.

No one remembered I was allergic to seafood.

No one remembered my back was still an open wound.

No one‚Äîcared.

‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you eating?‚Äù Christian finally noticed me.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm allergic to seafood,‚Äù I whispered.

The mood shifted immediately. Christian frowned and was about to ask the crew to change the menu‚Äîwhen a sudden gust of wind slammed into the yacht!

The boat lurched, tipping the grill and sending burning coals skittering across the deck.

‚ÄúWatch out‚Äî!‚Äù

All four men leapt toward Carrie, shielding her like she was the moon and they were her tides.

And me?

A burning coal landed on my dress, and fire instantly spread across the fabric.

I rolled across the deck, screaming as flames seared through skin and nerves.

But... not a single one of them turned to look at me.

Chapter 5
Blair‚Äôs POV

The four of them were still huddled around Carrie, frantically checking if she was hurt. Her arm was only slightly burned, but they acted like it was the end of the world.

‚ÄúCarrie! Are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me see‚Äîany blisters?‚Äù

‚ÄúGet the ointment! Now!‚Äù

Meanwhile, I was still burning.

In the end, it was a passing crew member who noticed me. He rushed over, panic in his voice, grabbing the fire extinguisher and dousing the flames consuming my body.

‚ÄúMiss! Hang in there!‚Äù his voice echoed in my ears.

My vision was already blurry. As I looked up, all I saw was the four men carrying Carrie below deck like she was made of glass. Their eyes‚Äîevery last one of them‚Äîwere only on her. Not a single glance at me.

They were my brothers, the blood I once trusted, but in my moment of agony, not one of them turned around.

By the time the crew carried me back to my room, every breath I took felt like knives in my chest.

The fire had torn through my skin, the burns so deep they clung to the bone. Every movement sent fresh blood oozing out.

I could feel the wolf inside me howling, trying to trigger my healing instincts. But the silver-lined whip wounds and the burns had suppressed it all‚Äîmy recovery was crawling at a snail‚Äôs pace.

The room was empty‚ÄîI was completely alone.

My phone buzzed.

I barely managed to lift my arm and answered the call.

‚ÄúMs. Swan, we still need a few documents for the private island you purchased.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll send them‚Ä¶ right away‚Ä¶‚Äù I rasped, voice hoarse from pain. ‚ÄúPlease, finalize everything. I need to get there‚Ä¶ as soon as possible.‚Äù

I had nowhere else to go. Nowhere left but that island I‚Äôd bought with my own hands‚Äîisolated, far away from everything.

But just as I hung up, a cold, all-too-familiar voice sounded behind me.

‚ÄúWho were you talking to?‚Äù

Christian.

I quickly shoved my phone under the covers and forced myself to act calm. ‚ÄúNo one.‚Äù

He stood at the door, gaze dropping to the burns on my body. His brows instantly furrowed.

‚ÄúWhat the hell happened to you?‚Äù He strode over, and for once, I heard a rare flicker of panic in his voice. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you call me?‚Äù

I looked down and gave him a bitter smile.

Call him?

I was screaming on the deck, my dress on fire, my skin burning, even my hair singed. And yet he, along with the other three, had all lunged for Carrie like she was the only one that mattered. None of them even looked back.

How could I possibly‚Ä¶ still call out to him?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúThe healer‚Äôs on the way. You should go. Be with Carrie‚Ä¶ She needs you more.‚Äù

To my surprise, he sat down beside my bed. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got people with her. I‚Äôll stay until you‚Äôve had your wounds treated.‚Äù

He reached out and gently brushed the hair from my forehead. The gesture was soft‚Ä¶ familiar. But I simply stared at him, calm and distant, the spark I once felt for him completely gone.

He belonged to someone else now‚ÄîCarrie‚Äôs mate.

Her husband.

He had marked her behind my back‚Äîsealed the mate bond. From that moment on, there was no going back for us.

‚ÄúDoes it hurt?‚Äù he asked softly, brows drawn together.

I shook my head lightly.

Hurt? Of course it did. My skin was splitting, rough like cracked bark, every breeze stinging like acid.

But none of that compared to the pain inside.

The healer arrived quickly, tending to my burns with the utmost care. Every touch was like a knife, but I didn‚Äôt make a sound‚ÄîI bit down and bore it. I didn‚Äôt want to scream. My wolf wouldn‚Äôt allow me to break down in front of them.

Outside the door, Carrie‚Äôs overly sweet voice rang out, ‚ÄúChristian! Come see the dolphins! They‚Äôre so beautiful!‚Äù

He hesitated, then finally stood and helped me up. ‚ÄúCome with me. Let‚Äôs go take a look.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt refuse. Didn‚Äôt have the strength to.

Out on the deck, the sea shimmered gold beneath the setting sun. A pod of dolphins leapt from the water, their graceful arcs slicing through the waves like something out of a dream.

Carrie clasped her hands and closed her eyes like a child making a wish. ‚ÄúHurry! Make a wish! I heard if you wish while watching dolphins, it always comes true!‚Äù

He laid me gently onto a lounge chair. I sat there, surrounded by faces I once knew‚Äînow strangers.

They all closed their eyes, too. People who never believed in this kind of thing, now silently making wishes like devoted believers.

I knew every wish in their hearts‚Ä¶ was for her.

I closed my eyes too.

I could feel my wolf growling within me, desperate to break free, to destroy everything, to make them all pay. But I was calmer than her.

I knew I had to survive, to leave this ship, to cut every last tie to my past.

‚ÄúBlair, what did you wish for?‚Äù Carrie leaned over, whispering in my ear‚Äîsweet, soft, and enough to make my skin crawl.

The four men turned to me as well.

I opened my eyes and looked at all five of them‚Äîfaces once dear to me, now nothing but poison.

Then I spoke, clear and slow,

‚ÄúMy wish‚Ä¶ is to never see Christian, Lysander, Orion, Zayden, or Carrie‚Ä¶ ever again.‚Äù

Chapter 6
Blair‚Äôs POV

Right then, a gust of wind roared across the deck, stirring up massive waves. The cruise ship lurched violently.

I opened my mouth, but before I could say another word, my voice was swallowed by screams and crashing waves.

Christian frowned and glanced at me. ‚ÄúWhat did you just say? The wind‚Äôs too loud‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt hear you.‚Äù

I was about to repeat myself when Carrie suddenly clutched his arm, pouting, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so dangerous out here! I‚Äôm scared‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs go back to the cabin.‚Äù

They all immediately gathered around her, escorting her back.

I followed behind them, walking alone.

I glanced back at the dolphins disappearing into the horizon and let out a soft, bitter laugh.

Maybe this was fate.

They would never know what I had wished for‚Äîthat I‚Äôd never see any of them again for the rest of my life.

They had never truly cherished me. Everything I gave, all my love and loyalty, meant nothing to them. And they sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd already made up my mind‚Ä¶ to disappear from their lives for good.

‚Ä¶

The day Carrie received the invitation to the socialite ball, all four men were ‚Äúbusy.‚Äù

‚ÄúLysander, Orion, and Zayden are flying to Paris to get that pink diamond for me,‚Äù Carrie chirped, waving the invitation with a sugary smile.

‚ÄúAnd Christian‚Äôs got some important alliance talks for his pack. Blair, will you go with me? Please?‚Äù

She blinked at me, putting on that helpless, wide-eyed act. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been five years since I‚Äôve gone to one of these. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll mess up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going,‚Äù I shot back immediately.

But before she could even respond, the men had already made the decision for me.

‚ÄúCarrie‚Äôs health isn‚Äôt great. Go with her,‚Äù Lysander said coldly, like it was an order.

‚ÄúYou know these kinds of events best,‚Äù Orion added, adjusting his glasses. ‚ÄúMake sure Carrie doesn‚Äôt embarrass herself.‚Äù

Zayden didn‚Äôt even wait‚Äîhe shoved me into the car. ‚ÄúTake care of her. Don‚Äôt cause trouble.‚Äù

The door slammed shut with a bang. Through the window, I saw them standing there, their faces etched with concern and worry for Carrie, and I couldn't help but find it absurd and laughable.

They only ever cared about whether Carrie was hurt or upset, never once asking if I was okay with it.

‚Ä¶

That night, Carrie wore a stunning red gown, basking in the attention like she belonged center stage.

‚ÄúHere, drink for me.‚Äù She handed me a glass of champagne, smiling sweetly. ‚ÄúIf I show up tipsy, what do you think they‚Äôll do?‚Äù

My fingers clenched around the glass, knuckles white.

She was doing it on purpose.

And I knew‚Äîif anything happened to her, they‚Äôd come for me first.

Glass after glass, my head started to spin.

‚ÄúOh no, Blair‚Ä¶ are you drunk already?‚Äù Carrie gasped, all fake innocence. ‚ÄúLet me help you lie down.‚Äù

I tried to push her off, but she was stronger than she looked.

Way stronger. She dragged me down a long hallway, out of the ballroom, and shoved me into a strange hotel room.

‚ÄúHave fun,‚Äù she whispered in my ear, voice sugary sweet and laced with something sickening. Then the door shut behind her.

I collapsed to the floor, dizzy and barely conscious.

A man I‚Äôd never seen before‚Äîa werewolf‚Äîwalked toward me, loosening his tie, that disgusting smirk on his face.

‚ÄúMs. Swan paid good money to have me take care of you‚Äîpersonally.‚Äù He chuckled, reaching for me. ‚ÄúAnd damn, you‚Äôre even better in person.‚Äù

I tried to fight, to scream, but my body wouldn‚Äôt respond. The alcohol had numbed everything. His grip was like iron around my wrist, his breath hot and sour against my neck.

Just as he lunged, Carrie‚Äôs voice rang from outside the door, delighted and surprised. ‚ÄúChristian? What are you doing here? Didn‚Äôt you have an important meeting tonight?‚Äù

His voice cut through the door‚Äîsteady and cold, just like always. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel right leaving you alone. I came to take you home.‚Äù

He paused, then asked, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Blair?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in the bathroom,‚Äù Carrie replied smoothly.

Summoning every ounce of strength I had left, I threw myself at the door. ‚ÄúChristian! Help me!‚Äù

Silence.

Then Christian‚Äôs voice again, lower this time, suspicious: ‚ÄúAre you sure she‚Äôs in the bathroom? I thought I just heard her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear anything,‚Äù Carrie said quickly, her voice tight. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs definitely in there. But if you don‚Äôt believe me, we can go check‚Ä¶ even though it‚Äôs time for my meds. I‚Äôll wait if you really want to‚Äî‚Äù

I felt my heart sink.

I already knew how this would end.

He‚Äôd do what he always did. He‚Äôd take care of Carrie first, bring her back for her meds.

Just like all those times before.

Christian was silent for a few seconds before finally speaking. ‚ÄúNo need. I‚Äôll take you back for your meds.‚Äù

Their footsteps faded away.

My chest caved in with the weight of it. My wolf whimpered in my soul, then fell silent.

Behind me, the stranger tore at my collar.

I shut my eyes, reached blindly to the nightstand, and my fingers found a crystal ashtray. I smashed it into his head.

Bang!

He crumpled to the floor.

I staggered up, stumbling barefoot into the hallway.

The hallway was empty. I ran‚Äîheels long gone, bloodied feet slapping against the freezing tile, but I didn‚Äôt care.

Rain lashed down as I stumbled onto the highway‚Äîonly to be met with a blast of blinding headlights.

Bang!

The impact sent me flying, crashing onto the ground yards away.

‚ÄúChristian, I think we hit someone!‚Äù Carrie‚Äôs panicked voice drifted from inside the car. ‚ÄúShould we check?‚Äù

I lay in the pouring rain, barely conscious, and heard Christian‚Äôs voice‚Äîcalm and detached. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll have Finn take care of it.‚Äù

Then, without a pause, he stepped on the gas. ‚ÄúYou need your meds.‚Äù

The car sped away, tires splashing water‚Äîand blood‚Äîall over my face.

I couldn‚Äôt move. I could only lie there, watching the taillights fade into the distance.

Rain washed the blood from my body, carrying it down the gutter‚Ä¶ like it was washing away the last of my strength.

Chapter 7
Blair‚Äôs POV

The moment I opened my eyes, the sharp smell of disinfectant pierced my nose. The heart monitor above me beeped steadily: ‚ÄúBeep... Beep... Beep‚Ä¶‚Äù

It took me a few seconds to realize I was in a hospital. Every inch of my body hurt, but it felt like someone had smashed my chest with a blunt weapon.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake?‚Äù A nurse stepped in, her voice gentle. ‚ÄúYour injuries are serious‚Äîyou‚Äôve broken three ribs. You‚Äôll need family to take care of you. Want to give them a call?‚Äù

She handed me a phone. My hand trembled as I took it.

The screen lit up‚Äîdozens of unread messages, all from Carrie.

[Christian peeled an apple for me‚Äîit‚Äôs so sweet.]

[Lysander bought me a new dress. He said red looks best on me.]

[Orion and Zayden stayed with me all day for checkups. They were so worried about me.]

[It‚Äôs been two days. One little ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dizzy‚Äù and they‚Äôre all running around me. No one asked where you went. A thief will always have to repay what she stole.]

[Blair, it‚Äôs pathetic‚Äîyou don‚Äôt have a single person who truly loves you. If I were you, I‚Äôd be dead by now.]

I stared at the screen, my fingers curling tighter and tighter until my knuckles turned white.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have family,‚Äù I whispered, handing the phone back to the nurse. ‚ÄúJust me.‚Äù

She opened her mouth, like she wanted to say something‚Äîbut in the end, she just sighed and walked out quietly.

Outside the window, sycamore leaves blanketed the ground. I stared at the IV drip‚Äîeach drop falling like the tears I‚Äôd shed over the years, each one a piece of love thrown away, forgotten.

Five days later, I checked out on my own.

As I opened the door to the pack house, a wave of laughter greeted me.

In the living room, Christian was slicing oranges for Carrie. The three brothers stood nearby, deep in some lively conversation. The moment they heard the door, they all turned toward me‚Äîsilence falling instantly.

‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù Lysander frowned. ‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you been home?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. Just walked past them and headed upstairs.

Behind me, I heard Zayden scoff. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs throwing another tantrum.‚Äù

I shut the bedroom door, slid down against it, and sank to the floor.

The pain in my ribs flared again‚Äîbut it was nothing compared to the ache in my chest.

A servant brought up dinner, but I didn‚Äôt touch a bite.

Later that night, my phone lit up again.

[You clingy little bitch. I‚Äôll make sure they know exactly who matters more.]

Expressionless, I powered off my phone and shoved it into the drawer.

The next morning, my bedroom door was kicked open.

‚ÄúBlair!‚Äù Christian stormed in, grabbed me, and dragged me out of bed, slamming me to the floor. ‚ÄúWhere the hell is Carrie?!‚Äù

Before I could react, Orion was in my face, yanking me up by the collar.

‚ÄúShe left a note,‚Äù he snarled. ‚Äú‚ÄòIf Blair doesn‚Äôt want me here, then I‚Äôll leave.‚Äô What did you say to her?! Did you drive her away?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù My voice was dry and cracked, barely audible.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still lying?!‚Äù Zayden roared, smashing his fist into my vanity. Glass shattered everywhere. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs terminally ill! If something happens to her, I swear I‚Äôll make you pay!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lying... I really don‚Äôt know anything.‚Äù

The air froze‚Äîfor a second, no one moved.

Then Finn‚Äôs voice rang out from the hallway. ‚ÄúI found Carrie! She‚Äôs at the edge of the cliff!‚Äù

The brothers‚Äô expressions darkened instantly.

Lysander lunged forward, wrapping his fingers around my throat. His grip was so tight I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

‚ÄúWhen did you become so cruel? Carrie‚Äôs dying‚Äîshe barely has any time left‚Äîand you still won‚Äôt let her be?!‚Äù

My head was forced back, mouth open as I gasped for air. Everything went dark around the edges‚Äîbut I still laughed. Bitter and cold, a sound laced with mockery.

How ridiculous.

First of all, who even knew if that ‚Äúterminal illness‚Äù was real? Just in the past few days, they‚Äôd flown in top-tier healers from around the world, tried every cutting-edge treatment and outrageously expensive miracle drug.

If she were truly dying, she‚Äôd probably be cured by now.

No‚Äîthis was just a convenient excuse. A neat little cover for why they‚Äôd forgiven her for running away before the wedding.

I didn‚Äôt say any of that aloud. But my silence only pissed them off more.

‚ÄúGet her in the car!‚Äù Christian barked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what it takes‚Äîshe‚Äôs bringing Carrie back.‚Äù

They dragged me out like a criminal. No one gave me a chance to explain..

We will delve into key features, benefits, and comparisons to help you select the ideal piece for your space.## Key Features Analysis

The variety of trunk coffee tables available can be overwhelming. Understanding their key features is crucial in making the right choice.

**Material and Construction:** Trunk coffee tables are typically constructed from wood,metal,or a combination of both. Solid wood trunks offer durability and a classic aesthetic, while metal trunks provide a more industrial or contemporary look. The quality of materials and construction is vital for longevity and stability.Pay attention to the hinges,latches,and other hardware,as these components can impact the overall functionality and durability of the table.

 The material composition substantially impacts the overall aesthetic and lifespan of the trunk. High-quality wood, such as reclaimed pine or solid oak, provides a rustic and timeless appeal. Metal options, often crafted from iron or steel, offer a sturdier and more modern feel. Ensure that any wood is properly treated to prevent warping or cracking, and that metal is coated to resist rust and corrosion.

**Size and Dimensions:** The size of the trunk coffee table should complement your living room layout. Measure your space to ensure the table fits comfortably without overwhelming the area. Consider the height of the table in relation to your sofa and other furniture. A table that is too high or too low can be uncomfortable and disrupt the flow of the room. Ideally, the height should be similar to the surrounding seating.

 Optimizing the dimensions is crucial for a well-balanced living space. For larger rooms, a bigger trunk provides ample surface area and storage. Smaller spaces benefit from compact options, such as lift-top trunks that offer versatile functionality without taking up too much floor space. Pay attention to the interior dimensions if storage is a primary concern.

**Storage Capacity and Organization:** A primary benefit of trunk coffee tables is their storage capacity. Look for tables with spacious interiors that can accommodate blankets, pillows, books, or other items. Some trunks feature interior dividers or trays for better organization. Evaluate your storage needs to determine the ideal trunk size and configuration.

 Effective storage is a hallmark of trunk coffee tables. Models with removable trays or adjustable dividers allow for customizable organization, making it easier to keep your living area clutter-free. Consider the ease of accessing stored items; lift-top designs offer quick access,while those with hinged lids may require more space to open fully.

**Design and Aesthetics:** Trunk coffee tables come in a variety of designs, from rustic and vintage to modern and industrial.Choose a design that complements your existing d√©cor. Consider the finish, hardware, and overall style of the trunk.Details such as leather accents, decorative rivets, and antique-inspired latches can add character and visual interest.

 The aesthetic appeal of a trunk coffee table is essential for creating a cohesive living space. Rustic designs crafted from distressed wood evoke a sense of history and warmth. Modern options frequently enough feature clean lines and minimalist hardware. Industrial styles incorporate metal accents and exposed rivets.

**Safety Features:** Ensure the trunk coffee table has safety features, especially if you have young children. Look for soft-close hinges to prevent the lid from slamming shut. Rounded edges can also minimize the risk of bumps and bruises. A sturdy base is essential for stability and preventing the table from tipping over.

 Considering safety enhancements is paramount, especially in households with children. Slow-close hinges safeguard against accidental slamming, while rounded edges reduce the risk of injury. Confirm that the chosen trunk is stable and won't easily tip, particularly when fully loaded with items.

Key features of trunk coffee tables include:

   Durable Construction
   Ample Storage
   Aesthetic Versatility
   Safety Features

## Core Benefits

Trunk coffee tables offer a range of practical and aesthetic benefits that enhance the functionality and style of your living space.**Enhanced storage:** Unlike conventional coffee tables, trunk coffee tables offer substantial storage space. This makes them ideal for decluttering your living room and keeping essential items within easy reach. For example, you can store extra blankets, pillows, books, or games inside the trunk, freeing up space in your closets and shelves.

 Enhanced storage capabilities are a primary benefit. By utilizing the interior space efficiently, you can maintain a neat and organized living area. This can be especially useful in smaller apartments or homes where storage space is limited.

**Unique Style Statement:** Trunk coffee tables add a touch of character and vintage charm to any room. Their unique design can serve as a focal point, enhancing the overall aesthetic of your living space. For example, a vintage steamer trunk can evoke a sense of travel and adventure, while a rustic wooden trunk can add warmth and texture.

 These tables create a unique visual interest, imparting character and nostalgic charm to any room. In comparison to standard coffee tables, trunks provide a distinct focal point that enhances your home's overall style. A weathered leather trunk can introduce a touch of historical authenticity to a modern living area.

**Versatile Functionality:** Trunk coffee tables are not only stylish and functional but also versatile.They can be used as coffee tables, storage units, or even makeshift benches when extra seating is needed.Lift-top models offer even more versatility, providing a convenient surface for working or eating while relaxing on the sofa.

 Trunk coffee tables offer a degree of adaptability that traditional tables cannot match. Some models feature lift-top designs, transforming quickly into a temporary workspace or dining surface. Their dual functionality optimizes space and enhances your everyday living experience.

**Improved Organization:** By providing a dedicated space for storing everyday essentials, trunk coffee tables can help you stay organized and clutter-free. This can be especially beneficial if you struggle with keeping your living room tidy. For example, you can use the trunk to store remote controls, magazines, or toys, keeping them out of sight when not in use.

 Better organization is a direct result of the storage capabilities. By providing a designated area for everyday essentials,these tables aid in keeping your living room clutter-free. This not only enhances visual appeal but also makes your space more functional and inviting.

**How do I care for and maintain my trunk coffee table?**
The care and maintenance of your trunk coffee table will depend on the materials it is made from. For wooden trunks, dust regularly with a soft cloth and use wood polish to protect the finish. Avoid placing hot or wet items directly on the wood surface. For metal trunks, wipe down with a damp cloth and mild soap. Protect metal surfaces from rust by applying a protective coating or sealant as needed.

 Proper care and maintenance are necessary to prolong the life of your trunk coffee table. Depending on the material, different cleaning and protective measures may be required. Regular dusting and occasional polishing will help preserve the beauty and functionality of your trunk.

I am an atheist and I see hindus criticizing muslims and think don't I and other atheists do all those yet nobody questions us.

Conversion - I have personally convinced my younger brother, cousin sister, 2 ex girlfriends and current wife into atheism. I even converted my college roommate too. (When he joined college he was a devout Brahmin who does suryanamaskar and other rituals when he left college he was a total atheist even once used a large sheet with a diety's picture as a coffee table cover to keep our booze and beef fry on).

If love jihad rulings were secular I would be in jail.

Infact the fastest growing belief is not islam as many believe. It's irreligious (atheists & agnostics). Hindus will be a minority in India not to muslims but to atheists.

Political lobby - well there are no muslim parties that form government in any state. There are atheist parties who successfully do DMK in TN & Communists in Kerala. 

We have successfully made baba ramdev apologise publically and overturned millenium old sabarimala policy (funny thing is muslim and christian bodies supported you guys in sabarimala case).

Killing/Terrorism - To be clear I don't support any form of murder and most muslims also don't do terrorism or murder. But if you look at   the numbers more Indians have died in the hands of naxalites & maoists than Muslim terrorists. 

To be clear I am not a communist I am very pro capitalism & pro industry.

Not all atheists are naxalites like not all muslims are terrorists.

Mutual respect - Many muslims & christians are respectful to hinduism.

Most atheists look down on hindus. Many openly insult hinduism on a regular basis just check atheismindia sub. Christian or muslim subs mostly talk about their own religion, while posts insulting other religions are fewer.

Mods - don't take this down it's an open query. It's not a ragebait. Just curious why we atheists keep getting a free pass while muslims and christians don't.",1,1754566782.0,AkhandBharat,4,1.0,False

Things like lending out a hammer, helping set up a tent, or offering a welcome beer (especially to backpackers) are second nature in the Wacken camp community. Here are a few short stories related to that Reddit post:

A woman from Poland approached us, she was traveling on a tight budget and only had a small tent. She was really happy to be able to stay dry under our canopy and hang up her clothes to dry.
When we found out she enjoyed coffee in the morning but didn‚Äôt want to buy one at the Breakfast Tents, because she was trying to save money, we ""accidentally"" started brewing a bit too much coffee every morning. We also made sure she could join in on the barbecue, which seemed to ease things a little for her budget.

One of our German neighbors had a leaky tent, but we gave him a tarp, and that solved the problem.

Three English guys borrowed one of our grills,hey were lovely neighbors the whole time.

Two sisters from Eastern Europe were happy just to have chairs to sit on in the evening. A small gesture, but it made a big difference for them. It looked like their backs were struggling from constantly sitting on the ground.

A woman from spain had never been in a proper mosh pit before but really wanted to try it, she just didn‚Äôt dare to go in alone. So a few of us took her with us to the next show, hyped her up, and stayed close while she jumped in. She came out grinning and said it was the most fun ever.

A neighbour had never tried German beer before (except Krombacher). We set up a little tasting session with different bottles from our crates, complete with reviews, rankings, and cheers. He told us it was the ‚Äúmost German‚Äù thing he did all week.",25,1754566748.0,wacken,2,1.0,False

1mjxo98,https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1mjxo98/my_experience_with_dating_apps/,My experience with dating apps,"Some people find love, partnership, and even marriage on dating apps.

But from what I've been reading for the last several years, the vast majority of us do not.
___

I've been using dating apps on and off since my divorce more than a decade ago and have found that for me, they tend to introduce all sorts of ambiguities and uncertainties into a process that I remember from my dating experiences -- back in the late 1970s and 1980s, before there were computers and the internet -- that were fun, enjoyable and a lot more satisfying.
___

The first thing to understand about dating apps is that they exist to make money for the company that created the app in the first place.

* For a company to make money with a dating app, the app can only be a *little* successful in matching people, because the more people who are matched, the fewer people there will be to use the app in the first place, and the less money the company that owns the dating app is going to make (or have the chance to make).
* This applies whether one simply uses the app for free, or pays for all the various features that the app provides.
* In my experience, I found that the chances of meeting someone suitable on an app were about the same whether or not I paid.
* And if you don't pay, the app will entice you with all sorts of special offers cleverly and carefully designed to play on your emotions and manipulate you into believing that if you **do** pay, your chances of meeting the love of your life will increase greatly because you can send ‚Äúcompliments‚Äù and ‚Äúsuperswipes"" and all sorts of other indications designed to let the other person *imagine* that you are interested. 
* Moreover, those of us who use these apps are led to believe that when we send a ‚Äúlike‚Äù to someone, then that person will in fact, receive the ‚Äúlike.‚Äù   I personally am not convinced that the ‚Äúlike‚Äù that we send is even sent.  Most of the time, anyway. 

Finally, keep in mind as well that there is a *very sound reason* why these apps can become addictive ‚Äî as I see it, they are essentially a form of gambling  ‚Äî and there‚Äôs a lot of information online about why that is.
___

I don't know what the experience is like for people in their teens, 20s or 30s, but when I was divorced (when I was in my early 50s) and started using these apps, I found that the women who I would meet, and who were within a year or two of my age (because I was seeking a partner at the same stage of life as me) bore only a faint resemblance to the photos that they had posted of themselves on their profile.

The photos were often 10 to 20 years old, sometimes older, and while I understood fully why these women posted such photos of themselves, the end result was that I felt deceived and lied to when we did meet, and that of course was not a very good way to start off a relationship... in fact, it was a deal killer for me much of the time.  

(Because for me, maturity is the indispensable prerequisite for a partnership: if a woman does not love herself for who she is ‚Äî and that means accepting  the loss of what society might regard as a certain standard of physical appearance ‚Äî then for *me* such a person will not be a good fit.)

(And of course I found out very quickly from the women who I met that posting these sorts of old photos was common among men as well.)

I don't believe in lying or deceiving other people, and I am definitely not ashamed of the way that I look (I take good care of myself), so it never occurred to me that I would post photos of myself that did not depict me as I was.

And the women I met would often tell me how ""relieved"" they were that I resembled my photos.  

I am polite and respectful and would never hurt anyone else's feelings that way, so I simply said that I felt the same way about them and their photos.

By the end of the date, I was often left with very mixed feelings.
___

I also remember that a lot of the women with whom I connected on these apps wanted to do a lot of texting before we met.

I'm not a big fan of texting for all sorts of reasons, especially not early on in a relationship before I have actually met the other person face-to-face.  

* The reason is that when you prematurely share your thoughts, your ideas, and in particular your feelings about various things electronically, you are helping to create a completely false sense of intimacy, because you are communicating with a complete stranger who has never met you in person and has no context for evaluating what you are sharing with them in print.
* In my judgment, this is why premature texting will often derail a relationship before it even gets off the ground.   (I've written extensively about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1l4yo17/why_premature_texting_might_derail_newly_formed/).)

I would often ask if they were interested in meeting sooner rather than later, because I was not a big fan of online communication, and while a few of them agreed, most of them thought that it was important to text each other because that way they believed (incorrectly‚Ä¶ they only *imagined*) that they could get a sense of ‚Äúwho I was.‚Äù

I understood that, because when you reach a certain age, you've had a lot of bad experiences and you don't want to waste your time.  And many people believe ‚Äî erroneously ‚Äî that they can reach some sort of conclusion about the other person by texting. 

Anyway, I indulged them and let them do most of the talking, and just answered some basic questions about myself, and tried to keep my contributions to the conversation to a minimum.

When they asked me questions about how I **felt** about certain things, I always told them that I was reluctant to talk about my feelings -- about politics, love, religion, cheating, dogs and cats, weekend getaways, vegans, and so on  -- in the absence of meeting them directly, and they seemed to understand.

I knew from experience that if I talked too much about my *feelings in the absence of face to face contact,* then there was a good chance that the woman on the other end of the app would begin to construct in her mind **an image of who she thought I was and how I felt about things**, and she would come to the first date with all sorts of preconceived ideas and expectations which I might not be able to live up to.
___
I remember very early on, before apps had a built-in video capability. 

There were many times when the women with whom I was communicating on the app wanted to have a phone conversation with me before we met.  

They explained to me that they thought that by hearing my voice and the way I expressed myself, they would be better able to make a decision about whether they wanted to meet me.

For all sorts of reasons, I was very reluctant to do that... a disembodied voice can convey all sorts of misleading impressions. (In more or less the same way that texting can.)

Anyway, I had contacted and made an arrangement to meet a woman who was, based on what I saw in her profile, extremely appealing to me.  She looked her age in her photos, was able to express herself thoughtfully and creatively, and we shared similar interests.

It was about 10 AM on a Saturday and we were supposed to meet each other that afternoon.

I heard a notification on my phone and I saw that there was a message from her on the app.

She had written to ask me if she could give me a call and chat for a few moments before we met.

She told me that it would make her feel better and more secure and asked if I would agree.

I reluctantly agreed, so I gave her my phone number, and a moment later she called me.

I answered the phone, and I heard a voice on the other end of the line which -- and apologies in advance if I sound harsh -- sounded downright scary to me.

I'm not sure how to even describe it... all I remember was feeling like I did not want to meet her, and that was *only* because of what her voice sounded like.

I knew that what I was feeling was irrational, so we chatted for a few moments, and then she told me she would meet me at the arranged place.

When I met her, and she introduced herself, I had a completely different and far more pleasant reaction.

There was a voice to go along with a face and a human being... there was **context** for her voice.  

And I soon realized that I would not be able to imagine her with a voice that was any different from that which she possessed. 

Anyway, we ended up spending almost an hour together, sharing stories over coffee and having a nice time.
___

I don't know much about algorithms or about how the software that runs the dating apps determines who gets matched with who, or how often you get a match, or whether all the various settings that a person can adjust --  such as location, hair color, looks, height, etc. --- have anything to do with the results that are generated when you search.

But what I do know is that, at least in my own experience, looking for love on a dating app is pretty much like buying a lottery ticket.

And I have no opinions about whether people should use dating apps or not.  

I have merely tried to share my own experiences with such apps.
___

I do remember one very funny profile, of a woman who was in her early 70s.  I was in my late 50s at the time, and she had reached out to me.  She lived about 800 miles away. 

In her message, she told me that she enjoyed reading my profile and that I looked like someone who she would like to spend time with. 

I knew that her distance from me was prohibitive, and I also knew that I wanted to meet someone who was about my same age and at the same stage of life as me.

Instead of deleting her message, I decided to take a look at her profile.

She wrote on her profile that after being on the app for about three weeks, she had developed ""tendinitis from swiping left,"" and that she had always been ""romantic"" ... but after spending a couple of weeks online, she was no longer sure.

I wrote her back and told her that even though I did not think that the two of us were a good fit, I appreciated her wit and thanked her for the laugh.

He‚Äôs been sober now for almost 3 months and I‚Äôm so proud of him. Before he went to rehab we had so many plans for the summer, lake walks after work, weekends at the cottage etc. Before he went to rehab he was adamant that we were together and would be able to have the life we planned when he was out and sober. 
He called me shortly after he got out to say that he just needed to focus on being sober for now which I did expect and asked if we could be friends. We finally met up for coffee last week and he looks and sounds so good. He seems so excited and happy to be sober. He said a few things that kind of threw me off like how ‚Äúeven a relationship with someone like me whose easy, still requires work right now, but i want someone like you‚Äù and then later on he mentioned that ‚Äúthey tell you not to date for a year but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll wait that long you never know when you‚Äôll meet someone, like if I met someone like you‚Äù. It was pretty hurtful that he just acted so nonchalant about our relationship and said that as if I‚Äôm just not good enough, like someone like me but just not you. I know he‚Äôs also probably making it seem like he‚Äôs doing better than he is but I feel like I‚Äôve been missing him since he was gone and just going through the time since he went into rehab and ended things in a daze and mourning the summer I thought I‚Äôd have with him while he just seems to be doing SO good. Going to the cottage still ect and I didn‚Äôt expect I‚Äôd feel so resentful of how well he seems to be doing. Like he put me through hell before he went in, put a list of baby names in my phone and talked about finally meeting someone he saw a future with to now just be essentially friendzoned with almost no acknowledgment of our relationship at all so now I‚Äôm left with that loss and he just seems.. good.

+20,000 miles cycled
+1.5 million ft of elevation gain
 
In truth I‚Äôm so ready to be done. It‚Äôs like reaching your physical and mental capacity by noon each day, with no choice but to keep pushing past it over and over again without end. Things never got any easier. I wanted to give up in Guatemala, in Peru, in Bolivia. I laid down on the rocks and prayed for a truck to crush me, but they never came. I almost quit just days from the finish line when headwinds topped 60 mph [100 kmh]. Winds so strong that I could barely walk the bike upright, never mind pedaling. You just have to find a way to keep going.
 
Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions for those interested:
 
1. How did you cross the Dari√©n Gap?
 
Met up with a Colombian sailor on the Caribbean side of Panama. We lashed my bike to the mast and sailed to Cartagena. This added several hundred miles of extra cycling in the process, but Colombia‚Äôs Northeast Cordillera ended up being a highlight of the entire journey. I wrote about it for The Travel Almanac!
 
2. Did you have any dangerous encounters with wildlife or people?
 
Daily wildlife encounters up north including grizzlies, moose and rabid wolves (wrote about that for Men‚Äôs Fitness magazine, very scary), but no troubles thereafter.
 
Mexico and Colombia were supposed to be the most ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù countries, but ended up being my two favorite. It helps that I speak Spanish, but so often when I would stop to ask locals for directions or advice as to safe camping, they would invite me inside instead, offering food and a bed [their own bed]. Friendly drivers would get out of their vehicles at stoplights to gift snacks, water, or just plain uplifting conversation.
 
Petty theft and violent crime do still happen obviously, so I‚Äôd read all the horror stories and explored accordingly. Women of course might have a far different experience than a 6‚Äô4‚Äù white American male too, with exponentially greater potential dangers to balance en route. But the only times I‚Äôve ever been robbed or hit by a car were in the USA.
 
3. Can I read more about your journey somewhere, and what now?
 
I‚Äôve been writing a full book en route that tells the linear bike travelogue interwoven with a memoir regarding my estranged mom‚Äôs death while I was still in Alaska ‚Äì with whom I hadn‚Äôt spoken since escaping their religious cult as a teenager ‚Äì and how these two arcs converge in the peripatetic search for familial belonging. Meanwhile, I started publishing a newspaper dispatch called Wayfaring Strangers for printed bits of kaleidoscopic travel writing and photography if interested in more (links ‚§¥Ô∏è in profile bio).
 
Glad to answer any further questions too if something comes to mind. Immense thanks for everyone‚Äôs kind words of encouragement en route üôåüèº Let‚Äôs get some coffee and go for a bike ride!",445,1754566272.0,bicycling,33,0.99,False

I‚Äôm a 32-year-old guy from the Liverpool area, UK, and I‚Äôm hoping to connect with some new friends‚Äîboth for online chats (Discord preferred!) and potentially meeting up if you‚Äôre local and around my age.

A bit about me:
Recently started hitting the gym (been going for about 4-5 months‚Äîalways up for sharing progress or workout tips).

‚Ä¢Big fan of video games‚Äîmainly PC and Xbox (got Game Pass too), open to recommendations or teaming up!

‚Ä¢I love good coffee, losing myself in the fantasy genre (books, games, shows‚Äîyou name it), and trying new food spots.

‚Ä¢What I‚Äôm looking for:Social friends for voice/text chat on Discord, who might also be interested in local hangouts or coffee meetups.

‚Ä¢Gaming buddies‚Äîmy free hours for gaming are Mon-Fri up until 4pm, depending on shifts.

‚Ä¢Ideally people around my age!

‚Ä¢A few more details:

Reddit Can‚Äôt Agree ‚Äî Let‚Äôs Settle This Academic Integrity Drama,"So, you just googled **‚Äúis using essay help cheating?‚Äù** while staring at a blank Google Doc, 6 hours before a deadline, wondering if that moral panic bubbling in your chest is worth failing *Intro to Philosophy* over.  
**Spoiler alert:** You‚Äôre not alone. **Reddit has thoughts. Loud ones.**

Let‚Äôs break down the debate like a professor with tenure and zero chill.

# üéì Academic Integrity or Academic Survival?

Welcome to the wild world of **academic integrity**, where you're expected to *‚Äúlearn independently‚Äù* ‚Äî even when your brain runs on **Monster Energy** and existential dread.

According to Reddit, paying for help = hiring someone to run your marathon. But you‚Äôre still the one who signed up for the race with a broken foot, zero training, and 3 other exams that week.  
**Fair?**  
Not always. Let‚Äôs unpack that.

# üß≠ The Ethical Essay Help Spectrum‚Ñ¢

|**Type of Essay Help**|**Ethics Rating**|**Reddit‚Äôs Reaction**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Proofreading / Grammar Fixes|‚úÖ Totally Fine|‚ÄúEveryone needs an editor.‚Äù|
|Outline / Brainstorming Help|‚úÖ Ethical Support|‚ÄúBasically tutoring.‚Äù|
|Full Custom Essay Writing|ü§î Murky Waters|‚ÄúDepends who you ask‚Ä¶‚Äù|
|Submitting Pre-Written Papers|‚ùå Hard No|‚ÄúEnjoy your expulsion.‚Äù|

If you're getting help shaping your ideas or cleaning up grammar ‚Äî most folks see that as **fair game**.  
But submitting someone else‚Äôs full essay? That‚Äôs where the **line gets blurry**.

# ü•ä Why Do People Hate Essay Services?

Let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî Reddit is savage on this topic. Here's why:

* **‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unfair!‚Äù** ‚Äì Devalues others' hard work.
* **‚ÄúIt ruins the system!‚Äù** ‚Äì Profs can‚Äôt trust their grades.
* **‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cheating!‚Äù** ‚Äì Sometimes, yes.
* **‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a scam!‚Äù** ‚Äì True, some sites are straight-up trash.

But lowkey? People also hate essay services because they‚Äôre **tempting**. And temptation = the academic devil in Grammarly‚Äôs hoodie.

# ü§∑ Should I Pay Someone for My Essay?

If you‚Äôre asking this‚Ä¶ you're probably spiraling.  
Here‚Äôs a quick Reddit-tested reality check:

* Are you doing any of the thinking yourself?
* Do you *understand* the topic?
* Are you learning ‚Äî or just outsourcing?

If you're involved in the process? That‚Äôs **delegation**.  
If not? You're entering cheat-mode, fam.

üîç Look for services with:

* **Originality reports**
* **Clear communication**
* **Custom work**
* **Transparent usage policies**

# üòÇ Funniest Reddit Takes (Because Academic Drama Is Peak Entertainment)

* *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like using Uber to get to class, then being judged for not walking. Bro, I‚Äôm TIRED.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúUsed a service once ‚Äî essay slapped, still felt like a criminal. 9/10 would feel guilty again.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúMy prof gave me a topic so cursed, Satan himself would've dropped the class.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only cheating if you get caught. (Kidding! Mostly.)‚Äù*

# üõü Real Talk: Who Actually Uses Essay Services?

Let‚Äôs kill some stereotypes:

* **Myth:** Only lazy students use them. **Truth:** Burnout, life stress, and language barriers are real.
* **Myth:** Rich kids just pay their way out. **Truth:** Some students are working 3 jobs just to survive.
* **Myth:** It‚Äôs always unethical. **Truth:** Help ‚â† plagiarism.

People turn to essay help because of:

* ‚è∞ Time poverty
* üò∞ Anxiety
* üìö Overlapping deadlines
* üß≠ Lack of guidance
* üíÄ Fear of failure

In short? **Being human.**

# üí¨ Final Thoughts: It‚Äôs Complicated, Like Your GPA

**So, is using essay help cheating?**

* **Short answer:** Sometimes.
* **Long answer:** Depends on the help, how you use it, and your intentions.

Academic integrity isn't black and white.  
It‚Äôs more like‚Ä¶ sad beige. Morally neutral until someone spills coffee on it.

‚úÖ If you‚Äôre learning from it ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **tool**.  
‚ùå If you‚Äôre copying ‚Äî it‚Äôs **cheating**.  
üò§ If Reddit‚Äôs mad ‚Äî that‚Äôs just Reddit.

# ‚öñÔ∏è TL;DR for the Sleep-Deprived:

* **Is using essay help cheating?** Depends.
* **Academic integrity Reddit** has mixed views.
* **Ethical essay help** = editing, guidance, brainstorming.
* **Should I pay someone for my essay?** Only if you're involved.
* **Why do people hate essay services?** Some scam, some cheat, some hate change.
* **Reddit opinion on essay writing** = chaotic, sarcastic, sometimes helpful.",3,1754566165.0,studying,34,1.0,False

1mjxhu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1mjxhu7/passportbroing_at_home_dating_ukrainian_refugee/,Passportbroing at home - dating Ukrainian refugee women in Europe,"Some folks asked me about this offline not long ago, and it made me look back on my own story, thought I‚Äôd share it here as well.

When my marriage finally collapsed, it wasn‚Äôt dramatic. No explosive fights, just a slow drift. Thirty two years of functional cohabitation, followed by mutual exhaustion and a polite solicitor.

I was 58 living alone, and unsure of what the future held. I‚Äôd tried the apps Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, something called Silver Singles that felt more like a care home waiting room than a dating site. I went abroad (Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam) in the best spirit of this sub and met hundreds of attractive girls with $$$ signs in their eyes.

One woman made me take a 60 minute compatibility quiz before we even met for coffee. Another asked me my attachment style before my surname. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they were smart, articulate and often quite funny. But everything felt like an interview you weren‚Äôt supposed to pass.

I once said innocently that I liked when a woman made a house feel like a home. The look I got was somewhere between pity and prosecution, and was blocked immediately after a barrage of abuse.

Another time I offered to walk a woman to her car after dinner. She yelled at me for thinking she needs protection.

So I did what many men do when they don‚Äôt know where else to go, I went back to church. And that‚Äôs where I found them.

An army of young, elegant, soft-spoken women. Ukrainian, new to the country, and more interested in talking about philosophy than astrology. They‚Äôd come over on refugee visas during the war, and the church had opened its doors.

Over the next year and a half, I dated (estimate) 20 to 30 of them. All of them, without exception, were way better than any woman I'd met so far in my entire life.

Some were devout, some more flexible. Most stayed at home, but some worked in care homes, others in admin or cleaning - no boss babes with overblown careers and ""growth mindsets"". A few had kids, but most didn‚Äôt. They were, without exception, serious. Not in a cold way, just intentional. They weren‚Äôt looking for vibes and they weren‚Äôt dating for sport.

Eventually, I met N, 29. She had no tolerance for nonsense, made phenomenal vareniki, and asked what I believed the role of a man was before she asked what car I drove. We‚Äôre now engaged and expecting a baby.

Here's what I wish I‚Äôd known earlier from my experience with dating Ukrainian women:

**Do a Gentle Background Check**

This isn‚Äôt paranoia, it‚Äôs just practicality. Many refugee women arrived in a rush. Some left behind homes, families‚Ä¶ and yes even relationships.

* Ask about the past. Kindly, over time. If there‚Äôs a man 'back home' she may not mention it straight away. Some are 'on a break' that no one has clearly defined. If you end up the guy she sleeps with while her husband fights on the frontlines‚Ä¶ well, it might get awkward and even dangerous fast. Ask me how I know.
* Kids? Don‚Äôt assume you‚Äôve met the whole family. Some women left children with grandparents, intending to send for them later. If you‚Äôre firmly done with the school run, ask early (trust but verify independently).
* Paperwork. Be aware of her visa timelines. Some women are under pressure to 'stabilise' their immigration status. This doesn‚Äôt mean the relationship is fake, but does add urgency. Be clear with yourself (and her!) about what pace you are comfortable with.

**Be Prepared for Directness**

Unlike many Western women who‚Äôve grown up around 'just seeing where it goes' dating culture, Ukrainian women tend to approach relationships with clear goals.

* Marriage is on the table from day 1. N asked me how I felt about remarriage on our SECOND date not as pressure, but as clarification. In a Western woman, that's a sure sign of a bunny boiler - but in a Ukrainian woman, it is a sign of her being serious.
* They‚Äôll assess your character. Your ability to provide, lead, remain calm‚Ä¶ these things matter very much*.* You don‚Äôt need to be super wealthy, but you do need to look like a very solid and safe option.
* She might hold impressive degrees on paper and be quite proud and outspoken about her education. If you work in a trade, don‚Äôt be surprised if she initially looks down on you (and lets you know about it). In Ukraine, having a master‚Äôs degree is extremely common, it‚Äôs almost the equivalent of a high school diploma, and often it‚Äôs earned by simply paying rather than studying. It doesn‚Äôt always reflect real knowledge. I‚Äôve dated a 'lawyer' who couldn‚Äôt write a basic appeal letter, an 'engineer' who didn‚Äôt know the difference between AC and DC, and a 'mathematician' who struggled to add up change. Just smile and think of it as one of her quirks.

**The Age Gap Isn‚Äôt a Dealbreaker**

Let‚Äôs be honest, in most Western contexts, a man in his 50s dating a woman in her 20s raises eyebrows if not accusations. But in many Slavic cultures, especially post-conflict, age gaps are seen very differently and positively.

* Maturity is valued. A man with a stable job and a quiet house is not a red flag, he‚Äôs a foundation. The youngest I've dated was 20 - she wanted marriage and children immediately, and was very serious about it.
* Status comes from wisdom, not nightlife. You won‚Äôt be judged for wearing orthopaedic shoes instead of designer trainers, but you will be judged for being flaky or not generous.

**Traditional Values Are Real**

Yes, most (all?) Ukrainian women cook, clean, and care for others with amazing grace. You will be treated like a king. But don‚Äôt mistake that for subservience.

* They expect partnership. You‚Äôre not hiring a maid. She may iron your shirts before your second date, but you‚Äôd better bring home the bacon and pay for her balayage (guess how I know what balayage even is).
* Conservatism is cultural, not political. Most are religious, modest, and family-oriented‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt mean they want to hear your lecture on feminism being toxic. Trust me.
* Sex. It is not happening until you are fully committed (not necessarily marriage, but clearly moving towards it - official, introduced to friends). Be a gentleman.",0,1754566040.0,thepassportbros,4,0.5,False

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to be applying for the role of Barista at 200 Degrees as I‚Äôm enthusiastic about customer service and admire the environment of the 200 Degrees coffee shops. The Birmingham store was a prime study-location for me during my A-Levels which had led me to admire the excellence with which the coffee was curated, and the spirited customer interactions of which I believe I could be a great asset to. I found that I enjoyed nothing more than small-talk with employees before sitting down with a latte and my book, and have since been infatuated with the prospect of becoming a part of this environment. Due to my vibrant and outgoing personality, I think I could fit in well to a 200 Degrees team and energetically balance customer service with teamwork as I adore forming friendly connections with customers and acquaintances alike.¬†

As demonstrated through my volunteer work at \[name + location\], I am thoroughly organised, hard working, reliable, and extremely adaptable. During my time there, I engaged in many different tasks and roles; I learned how to use Microsoft Excel whilst on the job, having to sign people in and out and ensure they‚Äôd done their safety checks, demonstrating my ability to learn quickly and absorb information in fast paced environments. I believe this would make me exceptional for the Barista role as I work efficiently in fast-paced environments and in stressful situations, due to being highly motivated to complete tasks with efficiency and a smile. Furthermore, at \[name\] I juggled my receptionist role with food preparation which guided me in developing adaptability skills and ensured I become accustomed to working fast and multi-tasking. Due to this food preparation responsibility, I similarly became acquainted with taking extra caution for customers with dietary requirements such as Celiac disease or dairy intolerances, and when dealing with these I maintained thoroughness and ensured I was taking exceptional cautionary approaches.¬†

Ultimately, I believe I would be an excellent asset to a 200 Degrees barista team due to my outgoing and friendly personality, my willingness and excitement to learn and absorb new information, as well as my relevant experience which demonstrates developed qualities.¬†

Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to the prospect of discussing this role further in an interview,

## Key Features Analysis

Choosing the right cozy cup involves more than just aesthetics.Several key features contribute to its overall performance, comfort, and durability.

**Material:** The material of your cozy cup significantly impacts its heat retention, durability, and aesthetic appeal.

Ceramic is a classic choice, known for its excellent heat retention and smooth texture. It comes in various styles, from rustic stoneware to elegant porcelain. glass offers a visually appealing option, allowing you to admire your beverage, but it may not retain heat as well as ceramic. Stainless steel is a durable and lightweight option, frequently enough with vacuum insulation for exceptional heat retention, but it may lack the tactile warmth of other materials.

**insulation:** Insulation is crucial for keeping your beverage hot (or cold) for extended periods.

Double-walled construction creates an air gap between the inner and outer layers, preventing heat transfer. Vacuum insulation, found in many stainless steel cups, removes the air altogether, further minimizing heat loss. Insulated sleeves, typically made of silicone or fabric, provide an additional layer of insulation and protection, but can be bulky. The effectiveness of insulation depends on the material and construction, so consider your typical usage scenario when making your choice.

**Handle Design:** A comfortable and ergonomic handle is essential for a pleasurable drinking experience.

Large, looped handles provide ample space for your fingers and allow for a secure grip. Smaller,minimalist handles might potentially be more aesthetically pleasing but can be less comfortable for prolonged use. Some cups feature handle-less designs, relying on the material's insulation to prevent burns, but these require extra caution when handling hot beverages. Consider the size of your hands and your preferred holding style when evaluating handle designs.**Lid Options:** Lids serve multiple purposes, including preventing spills, retaining heat, and allowing for easy sipping on the go.

Ceramic lids are often used with teacups, providing a traditional aesthetic and helping to keep tea infusions warm. Silicone lids offer a flexible and secure seal, often with a built-in drinking spout or straw opening. Stainless steel lids are durable and easy to clean, sometimes featuring a sliding closure for added convenience. The best lid option depends on your intended use, whether it's keeping your coffee warm on your commute or preventing spills at your desk.

Key features of a good cozy cup include:

* Durable material
* Efficient insulation
* Comfortable handle
* Practical lid

## Core Benefits

A well-chosen cozy cup offers numerous benefits beyond simply holding your beverage. It enhances your overall drinking experience, providing comfort, convenience, and even a touch of luxury.

**Enhanced Relaxation:** A warm drink in a comfortable cup can be incredibly soothing, promoting relaxation and reducing stress. The tactile warmth of the cup in your hands, combined with the comforting aroma of your beverage, creates a sensory experience that can calm the mind and ease tension.This is particularly beneficial during stressful times or when seeking a moment of tranquility.

**Improved Temperature Retention:** Keeping your drink at the desired temperature for longer enhances the enjoyment of your beverage.Whether it's a piping hot coffee on a cold morning or an iced tea on a warm afternoon, a good cozy cup ensures that your drink stays at its optimal temperature, preventing it from becoming lukewarm or watered down. This is especially crucial for those who savor their drinks slowly or who are frequently interrupted during their sipping.**Reduced spills and Messes:** A well-designed cozy cup with a secure lid minimizes the risk of spills and messes, protecting your clothes, furniture, and electronic devices.This is especially important for those who drink on the go, work at a desk, or have young children or pets. A reliable lid provides peace of mind, allowing you to enjoy your beverage without worrying about accidental spills.

**Stylish Aesthetic:** A lovely and well-designed cozy cup can enhance your personal style and add a touch of elegance to your daily routine. Whether you prefer a minimalist ceramic mug or a vibrant stainless steel tumbler, a thoughtfully chosen cup reflects your personality and adds a touch of joy to your everyday life.A stylish cup can also be a conversation starter or a thoughtful gift for friends and family.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about cozy cups to help you make an informed decision.**What are the best materials for heat retention?**
Ceramic and stainless steel are generally considered the best materials for heat retention.Ceramic offers good insulation and a classic aesthetic, while stainless steel, especially with vacuum insulation, provides exceptional temperature control for extended periods. Ultimately, the best material depends on your specific needs and preferences.

**Are insulated sleeves really necessary?**
Insulated sleeves can provide an extra layer of insulation and protection, especially for cups made of less insulating materials like glass. They also offer a more comfortable grip, preventing burns and making the cup easier to hold. However, sleeves are not always necessary, especially for cups with built-in insulation.

**How do I properly clean my cozy cup?**
The cleaning method depends on the material of your cup. ceramic and glass cups can typically be washed in the dishwasher, while stainless steel cups may require hand-washing to prevent damage to the insulation. Always check the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations.

**How long will my drink stay hot in a cozy cup?**
The duration of heat retention depends on the material, insulation, and lid design of your cup. A vacuum-insulated stainless steel cup with a secure lid can keep your drink hot for several hours, while a ceramic cup with a loose-fitting lid may only maintain the temperature for a shorter period.

1mjxdxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerReviews/comments/1mjxdxb/delve_into_whether_the_perlesmith_tv_mount_stand/,Delve Into Whether the Perlesmith TV Mount Stand Is Worth It,"Testing out the PERLESMITH PSTVS18 was an interesting experience, especially as someone who moves my TV around quite a bit depending on where I decide to set up for the day. The universal swivel TV stand claimed it could fit TVs from 37 inches all the way up to an impressive 82 inches, which seemed like overkill for my mid-sized TV. But hey, if it could handle an 82-inch mammoth, my 55-inch setup should be a walk in the park, right?

**Swivel Feature and Viewing Angles**  
One feature that absolutely stood out to me was the swivel capacity. The stand smoothly rotates up to 70¬∞‚Äî35¬∞ to the left and right. Positioning the TV to get the best view, whether I was perched on the couch, sprawled in a corner chair, or even blocking the fridge door (don‚Äôt ask why) was a breeze. I haven‚Äôt used any other stand with this kind of range, and it genuinely made family movie nights, where everyone chooses a different vantage point, surprisingly comfortable.  

[Check PERLESMITH PSTVS18 price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b08jgwtnzp/)

**Adjustable Height Options**  
Height adjustments on this stand surprised me with their flexibility. It allows for six levels of adjustment, raising the TV anywhere between 19.57 inches and 21.34 inches off the surface. I was able to fit a soundbar neatly underneath, something I couldn‚Äôt manage with my older, bulkier stand. It‚Äôs these little conveniences‚Äîlike just the right clearance for my soundbar and room for gaming consoles‚Äîthat made me genuinely appreciate the design.  

**Tempered Glass Base: Stability and Style**  
The tempered glass base was another unexpected win. It‚Äôs 17% wider than what you typically find, offering a much sturdier platform. I‚Äôve dealt with many stands where one accidental nudge could send the TV wobbling, but this one stayed put even when my dog decided to tail-whip the coffee table with all his joy. There‚Äôs also a safety lock and anti-skid rubber feet. Knowing that the TV wasn‚Äôt going to topple gave me peace of mind, especially since my niece has a habit of touching, well, *everything*.  

**The Installation Process**  
The box boldly claimed a ten-minute installation, and I‚Äôll admit that I scoffed at first. However, I was genuinely impressed. Everything needed was neatly packed, and the instructions were actually intelligible! Yep, no cryptic diagrams or screws that seem to appear out of nowhere. I had it assembled within the stated time, which was a record for me. Not needing to drill holes into my walls was another blessing. Who wants to deal with wall damage‚Äîor worse, arguing with landlords‚Äîevery time they upgrade or rearrange?  

**Universal Compatibility**  
The compatibility across brands and models added a lot of reassurance. Whether it's an OLED curved screen or a flat LED TV, this stand held it like a champ. The VESA pattern compatibility is vast, accommodating most configurations, from the smallest 200x100mm to the hefty 600x400mm. My neighbor was curious about the stand and tested it with his larger, boxy TV, and it worked just as well.

**Positives**  
A few standout benefits of this TV stand include:  
- Smooth 70¬∞ swivel range ensures excellent visibility from any angle.  
- The six adjustable height levels accommodate various setups.  
- Tempered glass base enhances stability and adds a sleek, modern touch.  
- Straightforward, drill-free installation with intuitive guidance.  

**Negatives**  
While I found many positives, there are limitations worth noting:  
- The stand, at nearly 16 pounds, is less portable than some lightweight alternatives.  
- At maximum extension, larger TVs (over 75 inches) can feel slightly less steady.  
- Wire management is minimal and could benefit from additional features.  

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve tried a few other tabletop mounts in the same category, including models from brands like FITUEYES and VIVO. While those have some thoughtful features, like integrated cable management or extra height adjustments, they struggled in areas where the PERLESMITH PSTVS18 excelled, like the wide swivel range and the tempered glass base‚Äôs stability. Some competitors also required wall-mounting for added security, which feels less flexible than what the PSTVS18 offers. However, FITUEYES did have a more robust cable organization system, so that‚Äôs something to consider if you‚Äôre always managing a mess of wires.

**Smart Spending**  
At its price point, this universal TV stand feels undeniably worth it. A product that offers a combination of flexibility, robust construction, and such a seamless installation makes you feel like you‚Äôve made a smart investment. Some competing stands might come in slightly cheaper, but they often sacrifice major usability features like swivel capacity or aesthetic appeal. I'd say this one earns its keep by giving you a clutter-free and versatile way to organize your TV setup. If you're hoping to streamline your living area or adjust your viewing angles without drilling permanent holes, this should be on your wishlist.

# Cool Local History: Hudson Bend Origins

Just learned this fascinating backstory - Hudson Bend got its name from Ed Milam who got lost in 1896 after selling cedar in Austin. He crossed the Colorado at McGill Ford and found his way home along what's now Bee Caves Road and Ranch Road 620. The roads he traveled likely followed ancient Native American trails used by Comanche and Apache tribes who gathered at Barton Springs and flint quarries near present-day Lakeway. Pretty wild to think we're driving on paths that have been used for centuries.

I am a 21M, kind of in a talking stage with a 30M. We have been talking for a month already but it seems to me that whenever we text, I am the only one who feels interested. I feel like I am the only one initiating. I know we have a very huge age gap and I'm unsure if it's because we're from two different generations that I feel like I'm the only one being interested initiating conversations. He's a good guy. He's busy. He's an engineer and works every weekdays from home and from office. We don't really talk much what happened on our days, on weekdays, we would only have just our good morning texts, and then the next conversation is the good evening one the same day. That's kind of becoming our pattern. We don't really talk much in the whole day and I'm giving our situation a benefit of the doubt because I know he said he's busy and I am too with my classes from morning to afternoon but I would always try to sent him messages during lunch and he would reply, but that'd be hours after I sent my messages. I appreciate his replies during lunch during his work of course but I also want him to initiate, I hope you understand what I am trying to say. Also, he would offer to send me coffee or food and would occasionally treat me for a meal even if we're far away. We live in two different places that is a 2-3 hours drive from each other. I don't know if this is also necessary but we haven't met in person but we both have planned a meetup in two weeks from now. What's your thought on this? ",0,1754565490.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Clich√© Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing clich√© in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clich√©s with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

**CCTV request per Jimmy Ross**
Please put this ‚ÄúCCTV request‚Äù  for this address in the system. I received a call from Code Enforcement concerning a sinking sidewalk at this property. We have a main line that runs under the sidewalk at this address. You can probably televise from CR4_271 up to the point it goes under the sidewalk. I do not think this is causing the problem but let‚Äôs make sure by televising the main since Code Enforcement is involved. 

I went onsite and spoke with the homeowner and she has other problems with her old style backtrack valve as well. Facing the property, the backtrap valve manhole is 5-6 feet from sanitary manhole. Please CCTV the main for condition and lateral launch to check the condition of her line if possible. She mentioned water coming up her line from the last big rain we had.

often that we have an overflow of trash. And we can't leave it in just bags bc of animals. Today the trash ran and again they left our trash can and we walked it up to them and they said ""there overflow there not allowed to take the trash"" so we brought it back and waited and tonight its now 11:51pm we checked the entire street and everyone's trash but ours has been picked up once more. There are NO obstructions, the trash cans, are neat and in a open accessable area. Last week they were going to leave it as well and the ONLY reason they took it was because I was outside. Before they started leaving the trash every time before that they would constantly be rude or give us attitudes because our street is a dead end street and we're at the very end. I called and reported them and ever since then its been every single week that they are just leaving our trash OR they will sling it around and bust the bags open and sling trash all over the yard and street and we have to clean it up.

1mjx7u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechTruthSerum/comments/1mjx7u2/should_the_lenovo_v15_be_your_next_best_business/,Should the Lenovo V15 be your next best business laptop choice,"If I were to describe my daily experience with the Lenovo V15 Laptop, it would honestly feel like unraveling layers of capabilities I didn‚Äôt initially expect. The Lenovo V15 delivers a balance of performance, portability, and versatility, making it a standout choice for someone like me who juggles work, creative tasks, and occasional streaming. Testing this laptop over the past few weeks has been an eye-opener for what a mid-range laptop can achieve.

**Sleek Design and Portability**

The first thing that grabbed my attention was its sleek, understated black design. It‚Äôs not flashy, but I appreciate the professional look. At just 3.75 pounds, its portability is commendable, especially since I‚Äôm often moving between meetings and my workspace. Despite being lightweight, the device doesn‚Äôt compromise on build quality. The anti-glare display is a subtle but impactful feature; sitting by the window, I experienced no annoying glare, making working outdoors surprisingly comfortable.

**Performance for Multitasking**

The Intel Pentium Silver N6000 processor with 4 cores and speeds up to 3.3GHz has been a dependable companion. Pairing this with the hefty 40GB DDR4 RAM feels like giving the laptop superhero powers. It tackled everything I threw at it‚Äîlarge Excel sheets, a ridiculous number of browser tabs, and even some image editing software‚Äîwith ease. I didn‚Äôt experience any lag or slowdowns, which isn‚Äôt something I can say about my previous device. 

[Check Lenovo V15 price on Amazon.](https://powerfinders.com/p/b0f9b8lqy3/)  

**Generous Storage Capacity**

I‚Äôm one of those people who hoard files (don‚Äôt judge), and the 1TB PCIe SSD offers more than enough room for all my work documents, media files, and random downloads that may or may not have a purpose. What stands out is how freakishly fast this SSD is. File transfers feel almost instantaneous, and boot-up times are non-existent; it's ready before I‚Äôve even finished my coffee.

**Connectivity Options That Keep Up**

The variety of connectivity options is a huge win for me. The inclusion of USB 2.0, USB 3.2, USB-C (my go-to), HDMI, and an Ethernet RJ-45 port ensures I can switch between tasks seamlessly. Having reliable Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 on board has been a dream. The absence of backlit keys was slightly disappointing during late-night sprints, but the full-sized keyboard made up for it with its tactile typing experience.

**Impressive Audio & Visual Experience**

Though I didn‚Äôt expect much in terms of multimedia, this laptop surprised me. The Dolby Audio-powered stereo speakers delivered a sound that was rich and immersive‚Äîperfect for zoning out with music or catching a short Netflix episode. The 15.6-inch FHD anti-glare display offered sharp visuals and vibrant colors, whether I was editing documents or casually binge-watching.

**Highlights**
- Well-designed portability factor at just 3.75 pounds.  
- Robust performance even for multitasking.  
- Huge 40GB DDR4 memory for effortless workflow management.  
- Fast, generous 1TB SSD to store everything imaginable.  
- Dolby Audio ensures a top-notch audio experience. 

**Bad Points**

That said, there are a few downsides:  
- The device lacks a backlit keyboard, which feels like a downer for those burning the midnight oil.  
- The absence of Thunderbolt support on the USB-C port somewhat limits potential connectivity.  
- Although the performance is solid, it‚Äôs not fit for intensive tasks like high-end gaming or dramatic video editing projects.  

**Competing Products**

Comparing the Lenovo V15 to its peers on the market, such as the Dell Inspiron 15 or the HP Pavilion 15, showcases why this device manages to stand out. The Dell Inspiron, for instance, doesn‚Äôt offer the same blend of memory capacity as the Lenovo. While the HP Pavilion flaunts a more modern design and slightly better performance at demanding tasks, its battery life compromises on longevity compared to the Lenovo V15. Here, the Lenovo takes the cake with its all-rounded capability and exceptional affordability.

**Affordable Quality**

When weighing its features against similar products in its price bracket, this device is a reasonably priced powerhouse. The total package of performance, capacity, and thoughtful design feels well-aligned with its cost. If you‚Äôre looking for something reliable but not flashy, this delivers solid value without gimmicky features.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to be applying for the role of Barista at 200 Degrees as I‚Äôm enthusiastic about customer service and admire the environment of the 200 Degrees coffee shops. The Birmingham store was a prime study-location for me during my A-Levels which had led me to admire the excellence with which the coffee was curated, and the spirited customer interactions of which I believe I could be a great asset to. I found that I enjoyed nothing more than small-talk with employees before sitting down with a latte and my book, and have since been infatuated with the prospect of becoming a part of this environment. Due to my vibrant and outgoing personality, I think I could fit in well to a 200 Degrees team and energetically balance customer service with teamwork as I adore forming friendly connections with customers and acquaintances alike.¬†

As demonstrated through my volunteer work at \[name + location\], I am thoroughly organised, hard working, reliable, and extremely adaptable. During my time there, I engaged in many different tasks and roles; I learned how to use Microsoft Excel whilst on the job, having to sign people in and out and ensure they‚Äôd done their safety checks, demonstrating my ability to learn quickly and absorb information in fast paced environments. I believe this would make me exceptional for the Barista role as I work efficiently in fast-paced environments and in stressful situations, due to being highly motivated to complete tasks with efficiency and a smile. Furthermore, at \[name\] I juggled my receptionist role with food preparation which guided me in developing adaptability skills and ensured I become accustomed to working fast and multi-tasking. Due to this food preparation responsibility, I similarly became acquainted with taking extra caution for customers with dietary requirements such as Celiac disease or dairy intolerances, and when dealing with these I maintained thoroughness and ensured I was taking exceptional cautionary approaches.¬†

Ultimately, I believe I would be an excellent asset to a 200 Degrees barista team due to my outgoing and friendly personality, my willingness and excitement to learn and absorb new information, as well as my relevant experience which demonstrates developed qualities.¬†

Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to the prospect of discussing this role further in an interview,

[As the U.S. redefines its global resource strategy, a growing network of allied partnerships aims to shift mineral access away from single-source dependence. - \(Steven Miller, Titan Missile Museum, Arizona; CC BY 2.0\)](https://preview.redd.it/2pgrdxudjkhf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d75b216cb5fb889f63006c5ab37c20e250905a73)

# Emerging partnerships signal a new era of aligned global supply.

As the United States moves to loosen China's grip on critical mineral supply chains, nations across Africa, the Arctic, the Americas, and the Indo-Pacific are emerging as potential partners in a broader strategy to secure resources and strengthen domestic production. While not all deals are finalized, diplomatic outreach, technical dialogues, and preliminary investment proposals signal Washington's intent to build resilient, allied supply chains and reduce reliance on rivals.

The search for secure mineral supply has pushed the U.S. to explore a wider field of potential partners, each offering resources vital to clean energy, defense, and advanced manufacturing.

A growing number of Arctic, Baltic, Middle Eastern, African, Asian, and South Pacific nations are joining a layered strategy to diversify sourcing and reduce reliance on Chinese-controlled supply chains.

The nations now under Washington's focus offer specific resources essential to U.S. priorities: rare earth elements and uranium from Greenland; cobalt, copper, and tantalum from the Democratic Republic of Congo; manganese from Botswana; rare earths from Namibia; nickel and cobalt from Indonesia; and additional regional contributions such as Rwanda's potential role in a broader minerals-for-security framework alongside the DRC.

These engagements differ in structure and progress ‚Äì some driven by draft proposals or investment commitments, others by technical studies or strategic dialogues ‚Äì but all aim to secure critical inputs for clean energy, manufacturing, and defense while limiting exposure to Chinese-dominated supply chains.

Of the few partnerships that have advanced beyond preliminary assurances, the agreement with Ukraine provides a model of how the U.S. aims to align critical mineral development with broader economic and security objectives.

Finalized in early 2025, the accord established a joint investment fund to support Ukraine's reconstruction, backed by future revenues from mineral and hydrocarbon projects, while also securing U.S. involvement in developing untapped resources like lithium, graphite, and rare earths.

*A more in-depth look at the landmark agreement between the United States and Ukraine can be found in the ""*[*Historic U.S.-Ukraine minerals accord*](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/08/07/critical-minerals-alliances-2025/historic-us-ukraine-minerals-accord/2423.html)*"" article on Page 51 of Critical Minerals Alliances 2025.*

Similarly, partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reflect how U.S. strategy combines government-level accords with large-scale commercial deals to secure critical resources and expand refining and processing capacity within allied jurisdictions.

These arrangements, established shortly after the Ukraine deal, are positioned to support regional supply chains while advancing shared goals of industrial diversification and energy transition.

*A detailed analysis of U.S. partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is available in the ""*[*U.S. charts critical future with Middle East*](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/08/07/critical-minerals-alliances-2025/us-charts-minerals-future-with-middle-east/2420.html)*"" article on Page 48 of Critical Minerals Alliances 2025.*

Together, these evolving relationships ‚Äì whether in negotiations or already formalized ‚Äì illustrate how the U.S. is working to transform early-stage diplomacy and commercial outreach into a resilient network of mineral partnerships.

# Greenland's critical edge

Rich in critical minerals essential to clean energy, manufacturing, and defense, Greenland has emerged as a pivotal node in Western efforts to secure strategic resources and reduce reliance on Chinese-controlled supply chains.

Holding 25 of the 34 minerals designated as critical by the European Union and 20 of the 50 listed by the U.S., including rare earth elements, uranium, zinc, graphite, and nickel, Greenland's geological endowment aligns closely with allied priorities in supply chain diversification.

Greenland has long held strategic value due to its proximity to Arctic sea lanes and the U.S. Air Force's Thule base, but global headlines surged in 2019 when President Donald Trump proposed buying the island from Denmark ‚Äì a move quickly dismissed by both Copenhagen and Nuuk.

The episode nonetheless reframed Greenland's geopolitical role, spotlighting its resource potential, military significance, and the risks of Arctic militarization and Chinese mineral influence.

After a period of limited diplomatic reengagement ‚Äì including the reopening of the U.S. consulate in Nuuk ‚Äì Greenland returned to the front page in early 2025 when Trump renewed his acquisition proposal.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen reaffirmed Greenland's sovereignty while acknowledging the Arctic's growing relevance to defense and economic cooperation. Greenlandic Prime Minister M√∫te Egede also rejected the sale but expressed willingness to pursue resource partnerships that respect self-rule and deliver local benefits. This stance has attracted interest from both government institutions and private developers seeking to align mineral projects with broader security and supply chain goals.

Among the most advanced efforts is the Tanbreez rare earth project near Narsaq in southern Greenland. Acquired by Nasdaq-listed Critical Metals Corp., Tanbreez is estimated to contain over 4 billion metric tons of ore, including a high proportion of heavy rare earths ‚Äì critical inputs for defense and magnet technologies that remain difficult to source outside of China.

Further north, the Citronen Fjord zinc-lead project, held by Ironbark Zinc Ltd., ranks among the world's largest undeveloped deposits of its kind. With permits secured and tidewater access available, Citronen has been reviewed by the U.S. Export-Import Bank for potential financing in support of upstream production tied to national security interests.

In the graphite sector, the Amitsoq deposit in South Greenland, being advanced by GreenRoc Strategic Minerals Plc, ranks among the highest-grade graphite projects globally, with measured and indicated grades exceeding 20%.

A 2024 feasibility study outlined an underground mine and processing facility targeting 76,000 metric tons of annual concentrate over a 22-year life. The Export and Investment Fund of Denmark issued a letter of interest to support the project, signaling a more proactive Danish role in securing graphite for European battery supply chains.

Additional activity includes exploration by Anglo American plc under a multi-year license in western Greenland, and continued advancement of the Disko-Nuussuaq project by London-listed 80 Mile plc ‚Äì a polymetallic system hosting nickel, copper, platinum-group metals, and cobalt.

Despite the scope of Greenland's resource base, development remains constrained by harsh Arctic conditions, limited transportation infrastructure, and complex logistics.

Environmental standards, Indigenous rights, and community benefit agreements impose further conditions on development, requiring projects to meet high thresholds for social and environmental governance.

Still, as Western governments pursue transparent, secure mineral sourcing strategies, Greenland stands out for its stability, alignment with allied interests, and resource diversity. While not easily developed, its mineral wealth and strategic location ensure it remains a focal point in the long-term effort to build resilient supply chains outside of Chinese control.

# Congo's mineral challenge

Home to some of the world's richest mineral deposits, the DRC remains indispensable to global clean energy and defense supply chains ‚Äì yet emblematic of the persistent risks that hinder resource development in high-stakes jurisdictions.

With copper ore grades averaging more than 2.5% ‚Äì four times the global average ‚Äì and four of the five largest cobalt mines on Earth located within its borders, the DRC plays a foundational role in battery, electronics, and advanced manufacturing markets.

Exploration investment reached over $130 million in 2024 alone, the highest of any African nation, reinforcing its centrality to the energy transition.

Yet for all its resource wealth, the DRC remains a complex operating environment. Corruption, contract opacity, political instability, and recurring violence have long discouraged Western investment, leaving China to dominate the sector through vertically integrated supply chains backed by state-owned financing and acquisitions.

American engagement has lagged by comparison, despite diplomatic overtures and early-stage efforts to de-risk investment.

As Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in July, ""Transforming diplomatic cooperation into tangible investment in the DRC requires a strategic and sustained effort by the United States ... its complex risk landscape continues to deter private capital.""

The latest development came amid escalating conflict in eastern Congo. Following the resurgence of the Rwanda-backed March 23 Movement (M23), Congolese President F√©lix Tshisekedi proposed granting the United States access to the country's mineral resources in exchange for security assistance.

Originally formed in 2012 and reactivated in 2021, M23 is a rebel group rooted in regional ethnic grievances and failed post-conflict reintegration. Its renewed offensive displaced hundreds of thousands and destabilized key mining regions, particularly in North Kivu and Ituri.

Tshisekedi's proposal catalyzed a new round of shuttle diplomacy in Washington and Doha, where U.S. and Qatari officials helped facilitate dialogue between Congolese and Rwandan delegations.

The resulting peace agreement, signed in Washington in June 2025, aimed to deescalate the M23 crisis and restore stability to mining corridors vital to global cobalt and copper supply.

While mineral access was not formally included in the agreement, the proposal became a foundation for subsequent discussions. Unlike the U.S.-Ukraine accord ‚Äì where critical mineral revenues were codified into a joint reconstruction fund ‚Äì U.S. engagement with the DRC remains exploratory, shaped by legacy risks and investor hesitancy.

# Broadening mineral ties

As U.S. mineral diplomacy expands into new territory, a broader slate of partner nations has entered the fold through preliminary coordination and strategic outreach.

Grouped within this emerging cohort ‚Äì Botswana, Namibia, Indonesia, Rwanda, and Vietnam ‚Äì are nations positioned to support allied mineral networks and reduce exposure to Chinese-controlled production and processing.

Leading the charge is Vietnam, advancing negotiations with a pace and magnitude unmatched, and marking the most significant step forward in U.S.-Vietnam relations since 1975. The country's elevation in diplomatic status carries both geopolitical consequences and supply chain potential.

Ranked second globally in rare earth reserves behind China, Vietnam has long represented a dormant opportunity in Western diversification efforts. That opportunity began to take shape with the launch of the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in late 2023 ‚Äì a diplomatic milestone that unlocked a new phase of resource and trade collaboration.

Since then, bilateral efforts have coalesced around rare earth development, with investment dialogues, technical assistance, and joint assessments laying groundwork to bring Vietnamese supply into the allied ecosystem.

In March, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation signed a memorandum of understanding with Vietnamese mining conglomerate Masan Group Corp. to support rare earth processing.

Though specific terms were not disclosed, the announcement signaled an institutional shift toward concrete cooperation ‚Äì marking one of the most direct U.S. investment overtures in Southeast Asia's minerals sector to date.

Vietnam's production of rare earth elements increased tenfold between 2021 and 2022, and new targets envision the processing of up to 2 million metric tons of ore and 60,000 metric tons of oxides annually by 2030.

While ambitious, these projections align with U.S. efforts to secure permanent magnet supply chains and cut dependence on Chinese-controlled refining.

This push coincides with recent developments in trade. In July, amid negotiations to avoid punitive tariffs on Vietnamese exports, President Trump announced a trade arrangement preserving a 20% rate ‚Äì lower than expected ‚Äì while alluding to reciprocal access for American companies and mineral interests.

While not formally codified as a critical minerals agreement, its format reflects a growing trend: tying market access to downstream cooperation on resources, processing, and investment.

At the same time, similar forms of mineral diplomacy are taking shape across other strategic nations. In Botswana, manganese supply discussions remain active; Namibia has advanced its rare earth export capacity with new Western partnerships; and Indonesia's nickel and cobalt sectors remain central to allied battery strategies.

Rwanda, meanwhile, plays a key role in regional coordination alongside the DRC and has participated in U.S.-backed dialogues on supply chain transparency and security.

Together, these emerging relationships illustrate how U.S. mineral strategy is becoming more layered and geographically expansive. Vietnam now anchors that strategy in Southeast Asia ‚Äì not only because of its resource base, but because of its alignment with broader trade, diplomatic, and security objectives.

In a landscape increasingly defined by supply risk and geopolitical competition, that alignment may prove as important as the minerals themselves.

# AUGUST 7th, 2025~Reforging critical mineral supply chains

[Reforging critical mineral supply chains - Metal Tech News](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/08/07/critical-minerals-alliances-2025/reforging-critical-mineral-supply-chains/2414.html)

# The US and its allies respond as China asserts its dominance.

**Welcome to Critical Minerals Alliances 2025, the fifth installment of the annual Data Mine North special publication dedicated to delivering in-depth insights into the rapidly evolving and hotly contested global arena of critical minerals.**

[NioCorp= Critical Mineral Security](https://reddit.com/link/1mjx3ch/video/hm1splx6jkhf1/player)

In past editions, we have explored the materials science innovations, geological realities, economic concerns, and geopolitical strategies reshaping the critical minerals landscape. In 2025, these themes have converged into a single, urgent narrative: national security, economic stability, and global technological leadership are all contingent on securing stable and sustainable supplies of the minerals of innovation.

Currently, however, all critical mineral roads lead to China, which has strategically and systematically established a near-total monopoly over the global supply of antimony, gallium, graphite, rare earths, and other materials essential to high-tech manufacturing, industrial processes, defense systems, and everyday living.

The 2025 edition of Critical Minerals Alliances hits newsstands and email inboxes amid intensifying supply chain tensions, heightened by China's growing assertiveness in leveraging its mineral dominance.

As explored in the article ""Red Dragon guards critical minerals trove,"" China's stranglehold over rare earths, antimony, and gallium is not simply an economic advantage but a geopolitical weapon.

""China remains a massive threat to our supply chains and has boldly reminded the U.S. just how deep our dependence runs,"" said National Mining Association CEO Rich Nolan.

Through a combination of resource hoarding and targeted export restrictions, Beijing is demonstrating that in the 21st century, geopolitical and global economic power is increasingly defined by access to the elements essential to automotive, high-tech, clean energy, and defense systems manufacturing.

Nowhere is this strategy more visible than in China's curbs on rare earths.

As detailed in ""U.S. rare earths supply chain reforged,"" Beijing has escalated the tech cold war with export controls on heavy rare earth elements critical to U.S. defense systems, electric vehicles, and clean energy.

**""This is a precision strike by China against Pentagon supply chains that enable our most powerful weapons and defense systems,"" said Mark Smith, CEO of NioCorp Developments.**

In addition to cutting off supplies of the rare earths most critical to military hardware, this precision strike impacted American automakers that depend on powerful rare earth magnets widely used in both traditional and electric vehicles.

""We shut down plants for three weeks because we cannot get high-power \[rare earth\] magnets ‚Äì magnets go into your speakers in your audio system, your seat's motors, your wiper motors, your door motors, and we can't make that stuff,"" said Ford Motors Company CEO Jim Farley, referring to a supply disruption caused by rare earth shortages.

Disruptions like these have elevated critical mineral supply chain resilience from an industry priority to a national imperative.

The response? A flurry of activity in Washington, Saudi Arabia, and resource-rich corners of North America to reforge mines-to-magnets rare earth supply chains that are no longer inexorably linked to China.

MP Materials and its Mountain Pass mine in California, the largest producer of rare earths outside of China, lies at the center of this reforging of global rare earths supply chains.

In a strategic move unprecedented in modern times, the Pentagon entered into a multi-billion-dollar partnership with MP Materials to establish a comprehensive mine-to-magnets rare earth supply chain in the U.S.

""All the right levers are here: equity, debt, price floor, and offtake. A full-stack solution to scale a startup facility against a monopoly,"" Smoketree Resources Principal Ashley Zumwalt-Forbes said, referring to the U.S. Department of Defense's partnership with MP.

From government policies to industry initiatives, Critical Minerals Alliances 2025 takes readers deeper into these unfolding dynamics.

Beyond rare earths, the magazine covers a spectrum of materials whose names rarely make headlines ‚Äì bismuth, germanium, scandium, graphite, tellurium ‚Äì but whose absence would send shockwaves through high-tech manufacturing and military procurement.

The economic and technological implications of China's quasi-monopoly of these tech metals were underscored when suppliers for the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech companies ‚Äì Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla ‚Äì sounded the alarm over a shortage of bismuth and other tech metals out of China, threatening to stall AI data center construction.

""The richest companies on the planet are stuck, because inspectors here in China are opening boxes and jars to make sure there is no bismuth heading their way,"" Kevin Walmsley, host of Inside China.

With growing urgency, U.S. policymakers, allied governments, and private industry are facing difficult but necessary questions: Where should we mine and refine minerals critical to modern living? Who should we partner with? How should our environmental and human rights values, along with our economic and strategic needs, guide these decisions?

For the team at Data Mine North, Critical Minerals Alliances is more than an annual report. It is a call for collaboration, innovation, and transparency. It is our hope that the insights shared here continue to foster alliances that are not paralyzed by differences but are instead strengthened by a common purpose ‚Äì securing the materials needed to build a safer, cleaner, and more resilient future.

We also invite you to explore further reporting and coverage at Metal Tech News, where we follow the latest developments in materials science, mining technology, and critical mineral policy throughout the year. And our sister publication, North of 60 Mining News, remains the premier source for the most in-depth and comprehensive coverage of mining and mineral exploration across Alaska and Canada's North.

# AUGUST 7th, 2025~Rare Earths Are China‚Äôs Trump Card

[Rare Earths Are China‚Äôs Trump Card by Angela Huyue Zhang - Project Syndicate](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-rare-earths-trump-card-in-trumps-trade-war-by-angela-huyue-zhang-2025-08)

*China‚Äôs dominance over the critical minerals used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, industrial robotics, and advanced defense systems was not built overnight, and it won‚Äôt be easily eroded. The sooner that US policymakers come to terms with this reality, the better.*

https://preview.redd.it/0qrvr9xukkhf1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=00c41c924bc1a5e49486b3a286b8d21b8fcaead6

BEIJING ‚Äì China‚Äôs weaponization of rare earths has emerged as a major flash point in US-China trade negotiations. These critical materials, especially the high-performance magnets they make possible, are vital components in electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, industrial robotics, and advanced defense systems. In response to China‚Äôs strict rare-earths export controls, the United States has quietly¬†[lowered](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/trump-china-rare-earths-0cbf3f3c)¬†tariffs, relaxed export controls on AI chips, and even softened visa restrictions for Chinese students.

At the same time, the US is scrambling to secure alternative supplies. In July, the Department of Defense¬†[announced](https://www.sfa-oxford.com/market-news-and-insights/sfa-pentagon-and-mp-materials-forge-u-s-ree-independence/)¬†a landmark multi-billion-dollar investment package to boost MP Materials, the company behind America‚Äôs flagship rare-earths project. But what if, despite massive subsidies and years of effort, the US still can‚Äôt escape its dependence on Chinese rare earths?

Japan offers a cautionary tale. In 2010, following a maritime standoff over the Senkaku Islands, China abruptly cut off rare-earths exports to Japan. In response, the Japanese government¬†[pursued](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-strong-armed-japan-over-rare-earths-its-a-lesson-for-the-u-s-230f8379)¬†a series of strategic measures: investing in Lynas Rare Earths, an Australian producer; boosting domestic research and development in recycling and substitution; forging its own commercial partnerships with Chinese magnet manufacturers; and building strategic stockpiles to cushion future supply shocks. More than a decade later, Japan still sources over 70% of its rare-earths imports from China.

China‚Äôs rare-earths dominance wasn‚Äôt built overnight, and it won‚Äôt be easily eroded. Its strength does not lie in hoarding raw materials, but in the industrial capacity to refine, process, and produce at scale. Today, China¬†[controls](https://cepa.org/article/rare-earths-can-we-de-risk-from-china/)¬†between 85% and 90% of global rare-earths refining capacity, and produces roughly 90% of the world‚Äôs high-performance rare-earths magnets. It is the only country with a fully¬†[vertically integrated](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2024/08/mine-the-tech-gap-why-chinas-rare-earth-dominance-persists/)¬†rare-earths supply chain ‚Äì from mining to chemical separation to magnet fabrication.

China‚Äôs manufacturing edge has given it not only an industrial lead, but also a technological moat. Between 1950 and 2018, China¬†[filed](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2024/08/mine-the-tech-gap-why-chinas-rare-earth-dominance-persists/)¬†more than 25,000 rare earths-related patents, more than twice the number filed in the US. Decades of hands-on experience in the complex chemistry and metallurgy of rare-earths processing have yielded a depth of expertise that Western firms cannot easily replicate. Moreover, in December 2023, China‚Äôs government moved to cement its lead,¬†[imposing](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means)¬†sweeping export bans on the technologies behind rare-earths extraction, separation, and magnet production.

China‚Äôs lax environmental regulation has also given its firms a powerful advantage over their Western competitors. In 2002, the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine in California was forced to¬†[halt](https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/11/12/the-collapse-of-american-rare-earth-mining-and-lessons-learned/)¬†refining operations after a toxic waste spill. By contrast, China‚Äôs more permissive regulatory environment has allowed rare-earths production to expand rapidly, with fewer delays and far lower costs.

Importantly, rare-earths chokepoints are not fixed; they evolve with technology. China understood this, waiting patiently as Western dependence on rare-earths magnets increased exponentially with the global green transition, which created massive demand for EVs and wind turbines.

Even if the West succeeds in building a parallel supply chain for today‚Äôs rare-earths needs, tomorrow‚Äôs chokepoints may lie elsewhere. Quantum computing, for example, increasingly¬†[depends](https://www.azoquantum.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=468)¬†on rare isotopes like ytterbium-171, as well as on elements such as erbium and yttrium. These emerging applications could become the next pressure points, leaving the US and its allies once again racing to catch up.

The US therefore must confront an uncomfortable truth: China‚Äôs dominance in rare earths is likely to endure for the foreseeable future. Defensive strategies like supply-chain diversification may address some vulnerabilities, but true resilience demands an offensive strategy that enhances American leverage.

The US still holds many valuable cards. As long as it retains control over technologies or infrastructure that China cannot live without ‚Äì be it advanced chips, frontier AI models, and access to the dollar-based financial system ‚Äì China has a strong incentive to keep rare earths flowing. For years, though, the US has pursued the opposite course: gradually decoupling and restricting key technology flows to China.

Since the first Trump administration, the US playbook has been to blacklist leading Chinese tech firms and tighten export controls on cutting-edge chips. While these measures initially hobbled Chinese firms such as Huawei and ZTE, slowing the country‚Äôs AI development, they have proved difficult to enforce. Riddled with loopholes, they created opportunities for enforcement arbitrage. As outgoing US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo¬†[conceded](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-biden-chip-manufacturing-gina-raimondo-b98c2606)¬†in December 2024, ‚ÄúTrying to hold China back is a fool‚Äôs errand.‚Äù

At the same time, US export controls have galvanized efforts in China to build indigenous alternatives, effectively¬†[accelerating](https://www.ft.com/content/bdfd7fc6-d0df-4070-96e5-7900b0cc1204)¬†the rise of national champions like Huawei. Far from strengthening American leverage over China, US policy is steadily eroding it. If you are Nvidia, losing access to the Chinese market doesn‚Äôt just mean forfeiting billions in revenue. It means losing influence over the most important AI ecosystem for developers outside the US.

Recent policy shifts suggest that this realization is starting to take hold. The Trump administration‚Äôs decision to relax restrictions on sales of Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chips to China signals a move away from blanket bans and toward more calibrated engagement. Counterintuitively, such engagement may be a smarter form of de-risking. The more that China relies on American technology, the more deeply the two sides‚Äô supply chains will become entangled, and the harder it will become for China to weaponize its own strategic assets, including rare earths.

General Motors¬†has entered into a multi-year deal under which Noveon Magnetics will supply rare earth magnets for use in components of the automaker‚Äôs full-size SUVs and trucks, the magnet maker said on Wednesday.

**China controls more than 90% of global rare earth processing capacity and imposed**¬†[**new export licensing rules**](https://www.mining.com/china-suspends-rare-earth-magnet-exports-report/)¬†**in April, tightening supply to Western manufacturers of everything from cars and fighter jets to household appliances**

Automakers, especially those focused on electric vehicles, are among the largest industrial consumers of rare earth materials.

Ford executives too have¬†said¬†that a pinched supply of rare earth magnets from China disrupted production.

Noveon said the magnet deliveries to GM began in July. It said it was the only operational manufacturer of sintered neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets in the United States.

**Sintered NdFeB magnets are currently the strongest and most advanced permanent magnets commercially available.**

Then delays started. first it was therapy. then it was needing more time. then it was needing six more months. Then back down to 2.¬† I offered everything i had. my home. my time. my money. my presence. i offered to move down there, get a place, pick up a random job, let you ease into things however made sense. I offered trips. I offered alternatives. You canceled a scheduled visit as I was leaving. You avoided rescheduling. you wouldn‚Äôt even talk about it. Every time Itried to clarify or hold a boundary, you pushed it further or changed the subject, or made it about my reaction.

The mental health crisis didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. I told you up front, a twice deployed combat verteran early 40 white male with an ACE score of 8, diagnosed major depressive disorder and a history of \_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_ideation‚Ä¶ who just ended a marriage and whose kids were moving or about to move on in their own lives. I warned you. Explicitly. I told you so many times, I need you to protect my heart, I need you to treat it gently and with care. I told you up front I have really bad abandonment trauma from childhood, and was just getting over and out of a marriage I learned had all been a sham, and had to rewrite the entire narrative of my life. I told you, 2 months is the extreme max I can handle. I told you over and over I didn‚Äôt know how I was going to make it.¬†

By that point, I was essentially going on about a year of little to no human contact. The total isolation, and the pain I felt everyday in my empty house that represented the dissolution of one family was a haunted liminal space constantly grating on my soul. I told you this all the time. I told you how hard the nights were. Isaid it often. I said it clearly. I told y ou how serious it was getting. You accused me of being manipulative. I was begging. and when it got worse, when I reached a point of ideation, you simply ignored it. You refused to stop sleeping in the same bed or even have a different bedtime than your husband, turning your phone off every night, despite knowing how insanely brutal you made every single night for me. To be clear, you told your combat vet boyfriend in his early 40s with a life expectancy of 46, which you knew, you‚Äôre on your own 7 nights a week while traumatizing him. Dozens of times i needed you.

Any attempt to mitigate or relieve the pressure was scoffed at. It was a 4 week long battle from hell to get you to even acknowledge that yeah, the situation was difficult for me. You simply repeated your mantra over and over that you‚Äôre able to regulate long distance, why wasn‚Äôt I? Then you‚Äôd frame it as weakness and moral failing in me, saying the relationship must not be as important to me as it was to you and will full court press try to get me to apologize for being triggered by your \*checks notes\* extremely triggering behaviour. At the time, you painted your husband as extradordinarily dangerous and so you had to quietly plan your escape and not tip him off. I subected myself to the daily soul scorching existential terror of being cheated on ever single night TO DEFEND YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE SAFE. Turns out, that was a lie he‚Äôs a big teddy bear would never hurt a fly. So what the hell was all that? Still don‚Äôt have an answer‚Ä¶.¬†

you said your trauma made it hard to act. you said your diagnosis made it hard to regulate. but you had the capacity to hide a concert. you had the capacity to lei¬† to my face and then post online . you had the capacity to morally launder your narrative in public while letting me fall apart in private. That‚Äôs just behavior. and I need t0 respond to behavior, not stories.

You‚Äôve said I scared you when I got reactive. but let‚Äôs be honest about where that came from. you withheld delayed, avoided, and then called me unsafe for reacting to it. you say it‚Äôs not reactive abuse if it‚Äôs coming from your trauma, but what am i supposed to do if you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre incapable of keeping us safe and you don‚Äôt trust me to do it either. someone hasto drive the car. and if you‚Äôre not in a position to co ¬† pilot, then you have to let me take the wheel. That‚Äôs just reality. If you we‚Äôre in a wheelchair I‚Äôd carry you up the stairs. I have always accepted and respected your limitations with love and never once used them against you or attacked you for them. I have always, at deep personal cost and unimaginable suffering, sacrificed to meet you where you were, as you were, with love and adoration.¬†

There were two major moments i can‚Äôt come back from. the first was the danger story. that narrative shaped everything. it changed how Iplanned. it changed how Imade sense of your delays. it justified secrecy. it won you sympathy. and then it fell apart. there were n0 threats. no danger. you weren‚Äôt stuck. you just weren‚Äôt ready.

The second was the concert lei . you went, you lied, and when i caught you, you gaslit me in the most unhinged, disrespectful , way possible. I walked. and for 10 days of excruciating no contact, you posted all of Reddit seeking advice for what to do when you‚Äôre telling the truth but your boyfriend won‚Äôt believe you. And it took ME to come crawling back to YOU. And you never once checked in to see if i was ok. The only actions you took were intendied to make yourself feel better in public. once i finally dragged the truth out of you, you reframed it as protecting me and refused to apologize for it. that‚Äôs manipulatiive af. you knew what it w0uld do to me and you did it anyway. and when I pulled away, you ran to reddit and rewrote the story again. You dragged me in public, the love of your life, based not on opionion, but known lies.¬†

At this point, Ihave to treat certain things as no longer reliable. your self¬† reporting can‚Äôt be the standard for truth anymore.¬† Not after what‚Äôs happened. If we were to ever rebuild anything, that would have to change. There‚Äôd have to be external verification, co authored safety plans clear roles in crisis, and agreement that your reactivity doesn‚Äôt get to override the safety of the relationship.

But we‚Äôre not there. And we might never be. Because the damage done was real. i‚Äôve been left with trauma symptoms, relational instability, physiological distress, and the kind of loneliness that makes a person wonder if anything was ever real at all. i‚Äôm not angry. i‚Äôm not lashing out. i‚Äôm telling you the truth, clearly and cleanly, because i needed to get to solid ground again. and the only way to do that was to stop pretending that love alone could carry all this weight. It got to the point where the hope I had that you would¬† finally show up was actively hurting me 24/7/365 and had pushed me into acute crisis. Which you were fully aware of.¬†

I gave you a hard 30 day timeframe and you wouldnt actually say yes to it, then revealed you were going to visit your family and after that you‚Äôd move in. as if that makes any sense at all i can drive you to the airport. And it was especially horrigying because I had asked you a zillion times if you ever wanted to go hang with your fam i could meet you there. But you turned me down, even when i offered to by the tix. then i find out that your going to visit them, delaying agiain because of it, and still refusing to meet me in another city.¬†

You still refused to believe that human beings need the presence of other human beings, until i showed you, sobbing, hyperventilating, shaking, saying i was actively in crisis¬† the data 2 days ago when i showed you all the actual physiological and pyshological symptoms i was suffereing after 18 months of little to not human contact, the last 6 of which consisted of a daily assault of brutal retriggering of deep abandonment and betrayal trauma.¬†

Then you said I was too much to handle, i needed professional help, and you sent me a screen shot of local mental health numbers and a response from chatgpt saying you loved me and would support me. then you left me on read for 6 hours. Then when you finally did respond, your responses were short and curt and came very slow. By nightfall, I was feeling more alone and terrified and discarded and unloved and huymilated and hopeless than I ever felt in my entire life. Sent you a message, because, of course, I couldnt call as we had to respect the man who posed no danger to you, whom you were about to leave forever, for some reason, so i texted all caps I REALLY NEED YOU RIGHT NOW. You left me on read.¬†

And for the next hour I wrote a very long, detailed, sad, basically mournful, not accusatory like this one, a hearbreaking farewell to us. I realized it was such a monumental thing you needed to be in person. But since you had refused to facetime at all for the past 6 weeks, that was off the table. i also felt i deserved to finally be seen in the state you put me every night, tear streaked and terrified. So i started sending you 1/10 2 minute videos reading what I had wrote, mourning us, and expressing a lot of love. You watched two and left me on read for an hour. So i unsent them and said spend the rest of your life wondering what I said and blocked you everywhere but email, as we had always stated the protocol should be.¬†

At first, this situaiton, although alwasys insane, felt plausible because of the way you framed it as a safety issue, that you had to slink around in the shadows to prepare or face the brutal rath of who i now know to basically be ned flanders. that was conscious. that was planned. you knew it was wrong. so why do it? the only explanation is that, you were protecting the relationship you cared about and risking my life with the one you didnt care about. theres just no other way to frame that.¬†

But once you started doing things lke going to concerts out of town and then, VACATION where you told me that you wouldnt be able to talk much because you two would be together all day‚Ä¶ i just‚Ä¶ that broke me and plunged me into hopelessness and existential grief and humilation.¬†

I waited for you every day. Every day. Every car that turned around in my driveway I craned my head to see‚Ä¶ was it you? Everytime we got ii a huge fight, i‚Äôd pick up the house and make sure we had fresh iced coffee, linens, and a freshly cleaned toilet. kept your favorite things stocked. because‚Ä¶ i mean‚Ä¶ you have no job, no children, no responsiblities, no friends even (that arent his) holding you to \*checks notes\* a few towns over, a 2 hour drive. You barely have stuff. You could have picked up your little doggy and hoped into your car anytime.¬†

But every day you chose to actively support, maintain, and grow your relationship with your husband while forcing me to exist, crammed in the negative space between your husband, whom you profess not to love at all, preferences, to spare you/him from ‚Ä¶. what?¬†

Please be serious you could have told him you were leaving in 30 days and spent the rest of the nights sleeping in a different room staying up late chatting with me‚Ä¶ as i had done for you in the beginning.¬†

You could have visited me. a bazillion times. you could have invited me down. i told you i had delta vouchers you could fly out to see your parents and i could meet you there.¬†

People on here often complan about ghosting and no contact and how painful it is. you yourself have said it‚Äôs extremely painful and you cna barely stand it. well. \*ahem\* i‚Äôve been dealing with that feeling daily for 6 months.¬†

so i want to be very clear, i¬† won‚Äôt spend a single minute in your life without being you‚Äôre number one priority. I‚Äôm a person. Not a boyfriend shaped appliance you can unplug at night. That ain‚Äôt love.¬†

Or. stay so bored in a sexless marriage with grandpa that you have to have a pet boyfriend that doesn‚Äôt ask questions or like, need things‚Ä¶

if there‚Äôs ever going to be a path forward, it starts with you acknowledging where your capacities end. it starts with you trusting someone else to lead where and when you can‚Äôt. and it starts with taking resonsibiltiy for the suffering you‚Äôve caused me and puting in the hard work of \*checks notes\* rounding out the summer having legendary sex and running around to the 79 things i have planned for us like a couple of teenagers who snuck out of their windows on a warm muggy night and went skinny dipping in a strangers pool. not that we would ever do such a thing.¬†

I already ran away. It‚Äôs time to stop looking out your window at me starving and sunburned across the street and meet me at the old abandoned library.¬†

If you make the coffee and appease the spirits I‚Äôll fix the leak in the roof and keep watch at night. ¬†

1mjx2k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gymhelp/comments/1mjx2k8/general_concern/,General Concern,"Hi all, I wanted to raise something that has been concerning me lately. Whether you are on your first day in the gym or a lifetime veteran, this still applies to you.

  
Our perceptions of what is ""good enough"" or looks ""strong, in shape, muscular"" has gotten out of hand. Why am I writing this? Because it is upsetting, even if is not grounded in truth, that so many people seem to be gravely upset or unsure of theri physique or progress.

  
So for this reason I just wanted to make a couple points:

  
\- Your progress is yours and your journey is singular. Please stop judging yourself on the basis of others. If you got up and worked out today/this week in any capacity, if you're eating well enough, you're doing good. As a matter of fact you are doing great. The best words I can offer plainly is, if you do something today, you promise yourself a better tomorrow. No one with an opinion of value is judging you off some kind of scale. The question should only be, ""am I, as an indivudal better or striving for better than I was the day before"".

  
\- ""Do I look like I lift \_\_\_ weght"". Does this really matter in the grand scheme of it all? what matters is if you can do that. I can assure you, no one of value to you is really eyeing you up to make up an assumption of what you can do.

  
\- Personal perception, our perceived perceptions of ourselves do not translate to that of what those around us see. If you feel small, that is most likely not the case in the way you think.

  
\- Social media and what we seem to consider as ""the standard"" has gone out of control. Take a good walk around outside, go visit places, a coffee shop, a different town, a bar, a public park. Just because of the mainstream appeal of bodybuilding does not mean that being in shape is the norm.

  
What I'm really trying to say is, take better care of yourself. If you're seeing this and you're doing anything on your journey, know you are doing well, better than you know. Try to be kinder to yourself.

  
If you post solely really looking for comments and positive affirmations, sure if that's what you need who am I to say. But I woudle encourage you to work on your self-worth and also understand, there are a lot of people out there starting out. Like it or not, in some capacity we function as an unconcious role model to them, so when we post and say, ""hey I'm in amazing shape and it doesn't feel good what can I do, what is going to make the difference, it's not enough"", you are also putting pressure on those who are new to this to believe nothing will be good enough. In doing so, we make the problem worse.

  
All in all, please be kinder to yourselves and stop falling into the isnane social media perception trap of unrealsitic beauty standards.",2,1754564630.0,Gymhelp,0,1.0,False

1mjwyub,https://www.reddit.com/r/thestatesofmind/comments/1mjwyub/how_to_communicate_with_highly_sensitive_people/,How to communicate with highly sensitive people,"My wife is a highly sensitive person, and at the beginning of our relationship neither of us knew that. We went through a lot of misunderstandings and near break‚Äëups before we figured it out. Back then I assumed she was overreacting, and her startled jumps after every little noise felt like some kind of act to make things dramatic. My understanding has changed completely, and it‚Äôs brought us closer.

After nine years together, I can usually spot other HSPs, and I‚Äôve watched them get accidentally traumatized by strangers, colleagues, and even friends who have no idea how sensitive they are.

I always meant to write a guide on caring for HSPs, but a Discord admin beat me to it (If you have any questions about HSP, feel free to join us here (https://discord.gg/QVdKXyCHqz) )

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an HSP, and I‚Äôm tired of explaining why I ‚Äòoverreact,‚Äô what‚Äôs wrong, and why I leave the middle of a great party. Sharing this manual is my best hope that one day someone will say, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not weird. I know you‚Äôre highly sensitive; I read the guide‚Ä¶.‚Äô‚Äù

A highly sensitive person‚Äôs senses and nervous system operate on a higher ‚Äúgain‚Äù setting. Think of the movie Senseless (1998): one ping on a coworker‚Äôs phone, and the coffee goes flying; a pigeon swoops overhead, and panic sets in; a raised voice during a silly pumpkin‚Äësoup debate, and everything freezes. Each shock lands harder and lingers longer, so flashbacks aren‚Äôt rare for us.

If you notice someone flinch at a clap, reread a text a dozen times before hitting send, freeze in a crowded room, or tear up when someone else cries, you may be looking at an HSP. Here‚Äôs how not to hurt us:

Start low and go slow with any activity, such as gym sessions, hikes, or parties. A friend once invited me on a moderate, newbie‚Äëfriendly 14‚Äëkm hike. I puked at the end because it was still too intense. And don‚Äôt get me started on the 48‚Äëhour Berlin party, I left after six hours, completely fried.

Please don‚Äôt prank or scare us for laughs. In school, I was the target: people loved my wide‚Äëeyed freeze or shrill scream. In my thirties, surprise jump‚Äëscares still nearly give me a heart attack, and I‚Äôve reflex‚Äëkicked more than one would‚Äëbe prankster, including my partner, who once popped up in a latex mask for a ‚Äúsexy surprise.‚Äù

Introduce new experiences and substances very carefully, and test one‚Äëthird of the recreational dose before giving an HSP the full amount. My worst experiences were my first roller coaster (at Disneyland, age 25) and a supposedly low dose of LSD, 70 ¬µg. While others had fun, I was in hell.

Don‚Äôt pity us. If I‚Äôm sitting in the corner at a party, nothing is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù; I‚Äôm just letting my overstimulated senses cool down.

Just let us cry. I can cry for any reason like smelling fresh bread that reminds me of my hometown bakery, being too empathetic and crying with a stranger at a caf√© after their breakup, kind words, harsh words‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs how HSPs process strong emotions.

Sarcasm isn‚Äôt always obvious. It doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt read sarcasm; we can, but at first we take it seriously.

Give us time to think. When I say those words, I‚Äôm not stalling; I‚Äôm running a deep simulation. Friends who give me overnight to mull things over get thoughtful feedback. Friends who demand instant answers usually get a flustered yes that turns into a no after midnight rumination.

The good thing is that we experience joy and other pleasant emotions more intensely as well. Make us happy and we‚Äôll share double the joy right back.‚Äù

I was pretty sure that there would be no tourists from 6:30 to 7:30 AM. This is what I call the waterfall hack: if you want the waterfall all for yourself, this is the time.  
  
But this is not a story about the waterfall, or the rain which followed, or about the crazy lady at the waterfall. Then? Read on. You need to rewind two days back. Yeah, I think two, or maybe three. Yeah, that‚Äôs when I met this guy.  
  
He looked like Indiana Jones. Yes, trust me, that‚Äôs how I saw him, with his hat, and what he was missing were those amazing boots. I had nothing to do, and the power went down, and the restaurant was barely breathing on its UPS.  
  
I looked at him, and he looked at my book, and immediately he started speaking about my book. Murakami, damn it, everyone reads him, I guess. I had two options: to continue this conversation or get up and introduce myself to that cute girl at the other table. I was lucky to continue this conversation with this esteemed gentleman who has travelled enough, and it is a story about him.  
  
I am going to spice it up with my own imagination, but the crux of the story wouldn‚Äôt be lost. Trust me, or don‚Äôt trust me, I don‚Äôt care. This story is about him and what he did when he was young. We spoke about many books, and our food came on time too, but our conversation gripped both of us, and we were enjoying our time together. They say, coffee, chocolate, and conversations: three C‚Äôs which complete a traveller. I don‚Äôt know whether anyone says that, or I think I just made that up.  
  
Anyways, almost all conversations get dragged towards women, and we spoke about Erich Segal. I don‚Äôt know how he ended up with him, and we spoke about that remarkable book written by him, called *Love Story*, and I asked him, why not tell yours?  
  
He looked deeply into my eyes, and I think he travelled somewhere else. Maybe my question startled him, or he didn‚Äôt hear. I was about to break his silence when he started speaking.  
  
Flashback.  
  
Imagine a young boy of 18 waiting on tables in his father‚Äôs beach caf√© for summer. And he sees an angel by the table. Ok, you may think I am hyping things up. Trust me, I did see that picture of her on his iPad, and she was indeed an angel. I think blondes are made in heaven. What you think? I think the answer is a resounding yes. Anyways, let‚Äôs go back to his life.  
  
This kid sees her, and he doesn‚Äôt know what to do. He was supposed to give her the menu, but he was lovestruck, and he kept standing, and he told me his father even scolded him, but our hero didn‚Äôt hear anything.  
  
He just kept staring at her. I looked at the 78-year-old man in front of me, yet what I saw was that 18-year-old boy looking at that angel. I think eyes don‚Äôt age, or do they? Who cares? Then he simply ran away, as he told me he was quite embarrassed. Can you believe that? I was just looking at her. Yeah, I was just thinking about my friend from the previous night, who was looking at pizza as if it is his next girlfriend. Yeah, men will do those things for sure.  
  
I simply nodded, and he told me the next day he did go to her table and served her breakfast, and he told me she had the most beautiful hat with a red ribbon on it. I think I will agree to it too. For the next 7 days, he served her breakfast, and one fine day, our hero had the audacity to ask her out on a date.  
  
Our heroine of this story told a resounding yes, and they went out on their first date. At that time, his coffee was served, and he asked for salt. I looked at him, but he requested salt, and he did add salt to his caf√© latte.  
  
Men can be stupid, and men can have some weird taste. He duly added salt and continued the story. I really felt offended. I thought it was a criminal act to add salt to coffee, and I indeed wanted to lodge a protest. Yet, I sat there silently as the grey-haired gentleman continued his story.  
  
It was our first date, he told me. I asked immediately, was there candlelight? He nodded, and it was in his friend‚Äôs place by the sea. And it seems they played violin during those times. I could hear the violin as I was thinking about that point of time, and I could hear those waves too. Can you? If not, please use your imagination.  
  
Women can be clumsy too, as she mistakenly added salt in his coffee instead of sugar. The French girl was paying her bill by the counter. I looked at her with a smile, and she returned my smile. Anyways, coming back to the story, she duly apologized to him, but our hero invented a story. He claimed that his grandfather came from Portugal, and as he spent most of his time in his boat, he added only salt to his coffee. His father continued the tradition, and now he too adds salt to his coffee.  
  
That lie relieved that young girl from her misery, and for the next 50 years, and even after two sons and 4 grandkids later, our hero was adding salt to his coffee. The heroine of the story passed away two years back, and our hero keeps travelling.  
  
I looked at him, looked at the coffee, looked at the salt. No words were exchanged, and I did add salt to my coffee too, and we did toast for Susan. Yup, that's the name of that angel who had an amazing hat, with a red ribbon on it.

Epilogue.  
  
Our hero has pancreatic cancer, and he doesn‚Äôt have much time. He is travelling across India, as Susan loved India, and it was her favourite country, and Bhagsu waterfall was her favourite place in the whole of Dharamshala. I have heard many love stories, but for the first time, even salt tasted sweet after listening to this gentleman.",3,1754564178.0,Dharamshala,5,1.0,False

Location: Misty Grove¬†

Status:¬†Unsolved¬†

*Like every morning, we left the station, picked up decent coffee from the only Starbucks¬†in the county¬†and listened to the radio morning show.*¬†

‚ÄúGood¬†morning,¬†Misty Grove! Looking to be another beautiful summer day¬†in August¬†	with¬†temps¬†to dip low this evening¬†bringing in some of¬†that autumn feel we have all¬†been craving!¬†But keep an eye out,¬†we are to expect some fog along with it.

¬†

‚ÄúTurn on a spooky movie.""¬†\*pfft\* ""This whole county is a spooky movie.‚Äù¬†I looked over at Roy, he was steadily trying to sort out who he wanted on his fantasy football team.¬†Oblivious to the radio. It was August,¬†and¬†to him it was ‚ÄúCrunch Time.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you think, stop to The Gem for lunch¬†today?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDawson,¬†It¬†is 9AM and you are already¬†wanting to plan¬†to¬†go to the other side of the county to get lunch?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI am seriously craving their Triple bypass burger!‚Äù¬†

^(‚ÄúUnit 121 and Unit 114‚Äù)¬†

^(‚ÄúGo ahead¬†dispatch...‚Äù)¬†

^(‚ÄúGot a call for a Status Check in Misty Grove for Mrs. Gwen.‚Äù)¬†

^(‚ÄúWait what!?‚Äù¬†Roy put down his phone.)¬†

^(‚ÄúWe got a call from Shirley. Said she¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†at¬†church¬†on¬†Sunday,¬†and she¬†	didn‚Äôt¬†show up to Wednesday Night Supper.¬†They went by her house but no¬†	answer.)¬†

^(‚ÄúCopy, show us¬†enroute.‚Äù)¬†

¬†

As we pulled into her driveway, a silence seemed to settle over the car.¬†The only sound was the crunch of gravel under the tires. The¬†yard and the house looked the same but different.¬†Almost like¬†someone has placed gloomy filter over the place.¬†Last night's fog still lingered in the wood line.¬†As we approached the door I was¬†taken aback by the stillness. No wind in the trees, no birds chirping. It was like someone¬†a¬†pressed the mute¬†button.¬†Roy must have been feeling the same because he started snapping his belt keepers as we¬†walked. Clearly the silence was making him just as anxious as it had me.¬†¬†

When we reached the door, Roy was quick to knock.¬†The stillness was shattered by the sound.¬†

No answer.¬†

He knocked again.¬†

Nothing.¬†

I knocked and called out. ‚ÄúMrs. Gwen! Its Officer Dawson and Officer Roy!‚Äù¬†

Still... nothing.¬†

We walked around the side of the house cautiously peering in the windows. Everything appeared in order at first glance¬†until we came around to the kitchen window. The herbs she kept in the sill were pitiful and wilted. Looking past them to the table,¬†sat Mrs. Gwen starring dead ahead, not blinking.¬†

Her¬†gaze¬†suddenly darted in my direction.¬†¬†

We locked eyes.¬†

I tried to collect myself and¬†gave her a¬†halfhearted¬†wave.¬†

Her head cocked to the side like she was unsure who I was. I motioned for her to go to the front door.¬†

Thankfully, she obliged.¬†

Once back on the porch, Mrs. Gwen opened the door.¬†Her movements were mechanical, like she was carefully choosing each action.¬†

Roy spoke up, a little hesitation in his voice. ‚ÄúUh Hey there,¬†Mrs.¬†Gwen. You¬†doing¬†alright?‚Äù¬†¬†

She turned her attention to him methodically. A smile spread across her face, but it¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†one that met her eyes.¬†

‚ÄúOf course, Officer,¬†I‚Äôm¬†sorry to give you such a fright.¬†Haven't¬†been feeling well lately.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm¬†so sorry to hear that. Is there anything we can do? I know some of the girls up to the church¬†were getting a little worried about you¬†too.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe can grab you some lunch,‚Äù I offered.¬†

‚ÄúNo need to trouble yourselves. Just a little cold¬†that's¬†all.‚Äù She produced a fresh tissue from her house coat and dabbed her¬†not runny¬†nose.¬†‚ÄúY‚Äôall are¬†very kind¬†to check on me, but¬†I‚Äôm¬†fine. Just¬†gonna¬†go rest now.‚Äù¬†

She gave a brief wave and¬†quietly¬†closed the door.¬†

Roy and I walked back to the car in silent shock. Mrs. Gwen¬†was not acting like¬†herself. At all.¬†

Back in the car, Roy was the first to speak.¬†

‚ÄúThat was¬†freakin‚Äô weird, right!?‚Äù¬†

‚Äú¬†‚ÄòWeird‚Äô¬†is a very polite way of saying¬†CREEPY AS¬†HELL!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI know! I know! But seriously, do think¬†it's¬†like dementia or something¬†cause¬†she was¬†definitely not¬†acting like herself?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHonestly,¬†dude. No¬†friggin¬†clue.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhy do we always get the creepy calls? Shit like this always give me with¬†willy‚Äôs.‚Äù He¬†shivered.¬†

‚Äú...The¬†willy‚Äôs?¬†So much for the bearded, buff, baddie exterior¬†huh?‚Äù I smirked. ‚ÄúBut, honestly, no judgement. We do get some serious¬†eerie¬†ass¬†calls.‚Äù¬†

*Looking back at some of the interviews the local news aired...that first house call we made. \*Sigh\* I wish there would have been more resources we could have offered.*¬†

**Interview ‚Äì Church Parishioner Shirley**¬†

""This is Connie with your Channel 9¬†Local¬†News and¬†I‚Äôm¬†here¬†with church parishioner Shirley¬†McCallahan. Shirley, can you tell¬†us about¬†your thoughts on the recent events¬†here in Misty Grove.""

‚ÄúWell Connie. Sure, we all noticed the fog. But Mrs. Gwen‚Ä¶ \*sobs\* it was just so awful. \*sniffle\* She changed. So suddenly too."" She paused. ""Stopped¬†wavin‚Äô¬†when you passed¬†by.¬†Didn‚Äôt¬†bake.¬†Stopped¬†comin‚Äô to church."" Shirley shook her head. ""It was like something was using her face. Like she was watching through it. When she said she had a cold, I believed her. But it felt more like a soul cold, you know? I just¬†don‚Äôt¬†understand why?"" \*sobs\*¬†

""Well folks,¬†it‚Äôs¬†a sad day here in Misty Grove. Just goes to show how much impact one person can have on a community.¬†

This is Connie with your¬†Channel 9 Local News, signing off.""

¬†

*About a¬†month later, the fog came back. This time, with fire.*¬†¬†*Then there was the¬†911 call¬†that¬†came in. One¬†no one would soon forget.*¬†

**911 Call Transcript**¬†

DISPATCH: 911¬†What‚Äôs¬†your emergency?¬†

CALLER:¬†She‚Äôs¬†out there‚Ä¶¬†she‚Äôs¬†out there setting fire to the rose bushes!¬†

DISPATCH: Ma‚Äôam, slow down. Who is ‚Äòshe‚Äô?¬†

CALLER: Gwen! Mrs. Gwen!¬†She‚Äôs¬†pouring gasoline on her porch‚Äîoh God‚Äîshe just lit it! She lit it!¬†

DISPATCH: Units are¬†en¬†route. Can you see any smoke or flames‚Äî¬†

CALLER: There‚Äôs fog everywhere. I¬†can‚Äôt¬†see the house anymore. The fog is orange now! I¬†can‚Äôt¬†see her but¬†she‚Äôs¬†still humming!¬†

¬†

It was dusk and we were heading back to the office for end of shift turn over when the call came out.¬†¬†

^(‚ÄúDispatch to any available unit near Misty Grove‚Äù)¬†

^(By all rights, our shift ended. But I looked at Roy.)¬†

^(‚ÄúYou think¬†its¬†her?)¬†

^(‚ÄúI¬†don‚Äôt¬†know.¬†But,¬†I have a bad feeling.‚Äù)¬†

^(‚ÄúAwww¬†man.‚Äù He ran his hand down his face. ‚ÄúGo ahead.¬†What‚Äôs¬†one more?‚Äù)¬†

^(Unit 121 and 114, we¬†aren‚Äôt¬†far. What do you have¬†Stella?)¬†

^(‚ÄúFire is already enroute... Mrs. Gwen‚Äôs neighbor called and said¬†that she saw¬†her setting fire to her rose bushed. She had a can of gasoline and was pouring it¬†on the porch.‚Äù)¬†

^(‚ÄúCopy...We‚Äôre¬†on the way.‚Äù)¬†

^(‚Äú121 Be¬†advised, they said she was humming while she did. She may be having¬†	some sort of mental break.‚Äù)¬†

^(‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù)¬†

We ran code.¬†

Nothing could have prepared us for the sight of it all when we arrived. Fire department¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†do much until the scene was safe. But bless them,¬†all the way back from the base of the driveway,¬†they were trying to hose¬†the tree line so the fire¬†wouldn‚Äôt¬†spread¬†while someone kept look out. It¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†hard to spot Mrs. Gwen,¬†though.¬†There she was on her half-engulfed porch, barefoot in her night gown,¬†torch in hand, lighting her own porch swing.¬†

We approached¬†the¬†Lieutenant¬†with¬†local volunteer fire department.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve¬†got full flame across the east side.¬†She‚Äôs¬†still got the gas can. We¬†can‚Äôt¬†get close.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt's¬†okay Doug.¬†We‚Äôre¬†going to¬†go see¬†what we can do. Just keep your boys safe.‚Äù¬†

‚Äú121 to Dispatch‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGo ahead, 121‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe may need some¬†additional¬†units to¬†assist. At minimum we are going to¬†	need the surrounding houses evacuated.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDispatch copies.‚Äù¬†

As we got closer, I could hear it. As much of a fever dream that this had felt like, none of it was as sinister as her humming.¬†

‚ÄúIs¬†that¬†Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor?!‚Äù¬†Roy asked incredulously.¬†

‚ÄúWe will talk about¬†why the hell¬†you know¬†THAT¬†later...‚Äù¬†

¬†

When we finally got her restrained, she acted like none of it had happened.¬†¬†

There she lay on the gurney, the sedation clearly¬†beginning¬†to kick in. I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†help myself. I had to know.¬†

‚ÄúMrs. Gwen...‚Äù¬†I put my hand on her arm. She was so cold.¬†

She turned to look at me with a¬†starry-eyed¬†expression. ‚ÄúHmm...?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhy...Why did you burn your house down?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt¬†you worry now, dear. I took care of it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúTook care of what?‚Äù¬†

Her eyes started to close.¬†

‚ÄúMrs. Gwen...?‚Äù¬†

She started to say something, but it was all mumbled. She had a pained look about her now. ‚Äú...in the fog.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬†I pleaded¬†

It came out as a whisper.¬†‚ÄúIt...it lives in the fog.‚Äù¬†

My mind was reeling. She¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†making sense. I gently nudged her. ‚ÄúMrs. Gwen...‚Äù¬†

Her eyes shot open!¬†

Slowly,¬†she turned¬†her head to face me.¬†And as sweet as you¬†please,¬†she said,¬†‚ÄúQuiet¬†now, dear.¬†Gwen is resting.‚Äù¬†

¬†

**Follow Up**¬†

¬†

Mrs. Gwen¬†was committed.¬†

Her house burned to the ground. Nothing¬†left but charred¬†remains.¬†

Officially the case is closed. She¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†charged with arson. They¬†labeled¬†it as accidental¬†due to¬†an episode¬†of¬†dementia.¬†My knowledge on dementia is limited but I have never heard of¬†someone with dementia¬†having multiple personalities.¬†

Since that last night the fog rolled in, we¬†have¬†had two residents¬†of Misty Grove¬†go missing.¬†

And according to Channel 9 Weather,¬†the¬†fog is said to roll in again tonight.¬†

Goal: maintain muscle while cutting fat. I have a strength competition in September so I'm prepping for that. Outside of that I just want to get in the best shape I can, not chasing a number on the scale.

Diet: Not perfect/strict carnivore. I still have coffee with sugar free creamer, energy drinks, diet soda, whiskey on occasion. (No beer). Mostly eggs, bacon, steak, chicken. Cheese sometimes. Only non-carnvore food that I have religiously is a low carb wrap for breakfast/dinner. I eat the same thing almost everyday. Goal has been to hit 1g/lb of protein/bodyweight each day.

I‚Äôm super excited, tomorrow I‚Äôm heading off to Basel for a night, and then I‚Äôm off to Zurich right after. I‚Äôll be traveling solo and plan to explore mostly on foot.

I‚Äôd absolutely love to hear your tips, recommendations, or even just fun ideas:
What are your favorite things to do or see in Basel if you‚Äôve only got a day?
Anything I really shouldn‚Äôt miss while I‚Äôm there?
Got any favorite spots for a coffee or a meal that won‚Äôt break the bank (local places are a huge plus)?
What about in Zurich‚Äîwhat‚Äôs worth checking out, especially if you‚Äôve got just a day or two?
If you know any cool walking routes, hidden gems, or spots that locals love (not just the obvious tourist stuff), I‚Äôm all ears!

However, on the DS, something must be different. Starfruit just must be weaker. They seem to fire less often, or less precisisely, or do less damage or something. Because replicating the same successful planting patterns on the GOTY edition leads to failure. 

I've tried alternative strategies: fume-shroom + coffee bean comes close, but not enough. At some point the bobsleds overwhelm you after you cannot reliably pre-empt them with potato mines.

1mjwp7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1mjwp7d/i_cant_do_this_for_the_rest_of_my_life/,I can't do this for the rest of my life,"I think I'd experienced occasional skipped beats throughout my life, but I feel like I've cursed myself with a chronic problem after having to visit A&E 1.5 months ago due to sustained tachycardia due to substance use (not something I'm looking to be lectured on, so please don't try).

At that time all my readings came back normal and I was ""fine"" once the fast heartrate tapered off, but in the weeks since I've been getting the pauses in pulse followed by the sort of hard chest ""wham"" with what feels like an increasing frequency, and it's driving me out of my mind. I thought at first it was just hyperawareness of my pulse due to medical anxiety following the hospital visit, but it seems like it's a problem that's getting worse and more noticeable as time goes on. I'll be walking around and I'll feel it as a hitch in my breath, like the air ""slips"" out of my lungs. Sometimes it can be due to specific triggers (anxiety and adrenaline certainly is one), but also it can just happen randomly. It's incredibly scary and unnerving - and that's not even to mention when it happens in a quiet moment and I can actually hear my heart stop.

I've now started having some heart workups, ECG came back fine, echocardiogram showed my heart has normal structure, and it's being hammered home to be that I'm not going to be offered any actual medical help for this - every doctor is just going to tell me it's within a normal range and tell me to get on with my life. But how can I just get on with my life? As much as I try to ignore it, every activity I'm doing I have a voice at the back of my mind as to whether it will cause the PVCs. I'm desperately trying to not let this prevent me from doing the things I love, but it's certainly causing me to enjoy them less.

Is this my life now? Do I just constantly have to be on the watch for my heart jumping out of my body until the day I die? I do have health anxiety, but I can't quell that when I'm stuck in this self-reinforcing feedback loop with a very real physical symptom constantly throwing me off of my game.

I don't know how to handle the prospect of living the rest of my life out in fear while begging doctors to please do something tangible to fix me. I hate the idea of giving up my current hobbies and lifestyle to spend my downtime doing yoga and abstaining from coffee, alcohol, any other sort of substance in hope that it will calm my heart (and then it not fully working anyway). Is there any sort of hope here? Or are my options learning to somehow not care about the symptoms or, to be blunt, feeling like offing myself after my life disintegrates? I'll be honest, the other posts on this forum don't give me much hope. I won't survive many more months like this, let alone years or decades.",2,1754563384.0,PVCs,5,1.0,False

This machine seemed to tick all the boxes: it brews drip coffee, caters to single-serve needs, supports Nespresso OriginalLine capsules, and even froths milk. With high hopes and a caffeine-driven determination, I decided to test it out and see if it lived up to the hype.

**Design Meets Functionality**

The build of this coffee maker is sleek and modern, with a compact design that somehow fits a multitude of features into one unit. The black exterior finish gives it a polished look, which complements contemporary kitchens. It isn‚Äôt overly bulky‚Äîthough at 14 pounds, moving it around isn‚Äôt something I'd want to do every day. The interface is straightforward, featuring buttons that are intuitive even for someone who‚Äôs half-asleep (like I usually am before my coffee). The 12-cup glass carafe was a nice touch, clearly catering to both small households and larger coffee-drinking crowds.

**Performance and Brewing Options**

Ah, the joy of having choices! I‚Äôve been testing this machine for a couple of weeks now to fully dig into its functionalities. The drip coffee maker stole the show during family breakfasts. With programmable settings and a 24-hour timer option, I was able to schedule a freshly brewed pot to greet me in the morning. Even the brew strength control came in handy, as my relatives have wildly different preferences‚Äîsome like their coffee strong enough to wake the dead, while others prefer a milder brew.

One morning, I decided to try out the single-serve feature. Selecting between 6oz, 8oz, and 10oz servings was simple. It‚Äôs compatible with most coffee pods, including Keurig K-Cups, which was a win for me. On another day, curiosity got the better of me, so I tested its Nespresso compatibility. The single and double espresso shot options were smooth and satisfying‚Äîlike having a mini caf√© experience.

**Check [Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS] price on Amazon.**

**The Wonder of the Milk Frother**

Having a steam wand built into the unit was a high point. While I‚Äôm far from a professional barista, the frother allowed me to whip up some pretty decent lattes and cappuccinos. I even used it to make hot cocoa for the kids, and they adored it. Beyond coffee, the steam wand doubles as a hot water tap for tea or soups, which turned out to be quite convenient when I wanted something warm on a winter evening.

**Benefits**

- All-in-one functionality saves counter space and simplifies morning routines.
- Includes customizable brewing features like programmable strength, size, and timer settings.
- Compatible with both loose coffee grounds and pods, including Nespresso capsules.
- The built-in frother is versatile and ideal for barista-style beverages.  
- A reusable gold-tone filter and charcoal water filter enhance flavor and reduce waste.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Cleaning the milk frother can be tedious; it requires immediate attention to avoid clogging.
- The machine occasionally feels noisy, particularly when using the single-serve or frothing options.
- It‚Äôs a bit heavy for those who might need to store and relocate it often.

**Competing Products**

Compared to other multi-functional coffee systems like Keurig K-Caf√© and Breville‚Äôs Nespresso Creatista, this unit holds its own but has some distinctions worth noting. Both competitors excel in their frothing technology, with Breville‚Äôs wand offering greater precision for latte art lovers. On the other hand, the Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS shines in its ability to handle drip coffee and single-serve brewing without buying two separate machines. That said, brands like Keurig tend to deliver quieter operations, especially in single-serve modes.  

If you‚Äôre looking for versatility and have a preference for transitioning between drip coffee and espresso, this machine takes the crown. But if you‚Äôre particular about pod brewing or foam consistency, Breville might edge ahead.

**Price Worthiness**

Investing in this coffee maker felt like a smart move since it replaced the need for multiple appliances. Though the price point isn‚Äôt the lowest in its category, the variety of features makes it worth considering, especially for households with diverse coffee preferences. The added value of programmable brew settings and Nespresso compatibility sweetens the deal.

I still couldn‚Äôt believe that it was done. That I was finally divorced from him. The proof of that was currently in my handbag. I was here to bring the final papers to him and to pick Noah up.

Entering the house, I follow the sounds of hushed voices but stop in my tracks when I near the kitchen.

Right now I could hear them clearly and what I heard encased my soul in ice.

‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt understand why you can‚Äôt live with me and mommy?‚Äù Noah asks his father.

My shaking hands go to my chest. My heart breaking at the sadness in his voice. I would do anything for him, but this divorce was inevitable.

Our marriage had been a mistake. Everything about us was a mistake. It just took me a while to see the truth.

‚ÄúYou know why Noah, you mother and I are no longer together‚Äù His voice is soft as he replies.

It‚Äôs weird really. That during the duration of our marriage he has never once spoken to me softly. It was always cold. Always flat and devoid of any emotion

‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù

‚ÄúThese things just happen‚Äù he mumbles.

I can imagine his face frowning. As he tries to make Noah understand so that he doesn‚Äôt ask any more questions. But Noah is my son. Curiosity and inquisition is in his blood.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you love her?‚Äù

My breath gets caught at the simple heartfelt question. I take a step back and lean against the wall. Heart racing, I wait in anticipation for his answer.

I knew his answer. I‚Äôve always known what it is. Everyone with the exception of Noah probably knows that answer.

The truth is he doesn‚Äôt love me. Never had and never will. That was as clear as day. Knowing this, I still wanted to hear his reply. Would he tell our son the truth or lie to him?

He clears his throat, obviously stalling. ‚ÄúNoah‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, do you love mommy or not?‚Äù Noah asks again, his voice final.

I hear him sigh in defeat. ‚ÄúI love her for giving me you‚Äù he finally says.

It was a placation not an answer.

I close my eyes against the rush of pain that fills me. After all this time. It still hurts. I feel my heart breaking all over again. I don‚Äôt know why a small part of me had hoped that his answer would be different.

He never said those three words to me. Not when we got married or when I gave birth to Noah, nor after in the years that had passed or when we slept together.

He held himself back through the entire duration of our marriage. I gave him my all but he gave me nothing in return except pain and heartache.

We were married but instead of two, there were three of us in our marriage. Him, me and the love of his life. The woman he‚Äôs refused to let go for nine long years.

Tears fill my eyes but I rub them way. I was tired of crying. Tired of chasing after a man that didn‚Äôt want me.

‚ÄúHas anyone ever told you it‚Äôs rude to listen to other people‚Äôs conversations?‚Äù

His deep voice cuts through the silent space. Interrupting my thoughts in the process. I square my shoulders and enter the kitchen.

There he stands near the kitchen counter. My now ex-husband, Rowan Woods.

His mocking grey eyes pins me to the spot.

My eyes shift to my son. My pride and joy. The only good thing in my life. His good looks are definitely curtesy of his dad. He has my brown hair and his penetrating grey eyes.

‚ÄúHello‚Äù I give them a small smile.

‚ÄúHi mommy‚Äù Noah places his half eaten sandwich down and jumps down from the counter. He rushes to me and hugs my mid-section. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed you‚Äù

‚ÄúMissed you too, my love‚Äù I kiss his forehead before he steps away from me and goes back to his food.

I stand there awkwardly. This used to be my home, but now I feel out of place in it. Like I don‚Äôt belong.

In truth though, I never did.

Knowingly or unknowingly, he built this house with HER in mind. This was HER dream house, everything down to the color scheme.

That should have been the first indication that he wasn‚Äôt planning on letting her go. That he wouldn‚Äôt reciprocate my love for him.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù he asks in annoyance and stares at his watch. ‚ÄúYou promised you wouldn‚Äôt interrupt my time with Noah‚Äù

‚ÄúI know‚Ä¶I got the divorce degree today and I thought I could bring you the copy while I pick up Noah‚Äù

His face turns stone cold and his lips form a thin line. Every time he looks at me like this, a piece of me breaks. I‚Äôve loved him since I can remember but that doesn‚Äôt mean anything to him.

Over and over, he has broken my heart and shattered my soul. I continued loving him. Holding on. Thinking things will change, but they never did.

When we got married I thought I would finally get love. The love I‚Äôve been craving since I was a child. I was wrong. Marriage turned to be a nightmare. I was always fighting with the ghost of his past. The ghost of a girl I could never measure up to no matter how much I tried.

I rub my chest. Trying to ease the pain that was encased there.

It does no good. It still hurts even though we‚Äôve been separated for months.

‚ÄúNoah, could you go up to your room? Your mother and I need to discuss something‚Äù Rowan says through clenched teeth, the word mother slipping out of his mouth in disgust.

He looks between us for a minute before nodding.

‚ÄúNo fighting‚Äù he commands before leaving.

As soon as he is out of ear shot, Rowan bangs his fist on the counter in anger. His grey eyes are icy as he addresses me.

‚ÄúYou could have sent them to my office instead of interrupting my time with my son‚Äù the words leave in a growl. His hands are fisted and he looks about ready to blow up on me.

‚ÄúRowan‚Ä¶‚Äù I sigh, unable to complete the sentence.

‚ÄúNo. ABSOLUTELY No! You turned my life upside down nine years ago, you did it again when you asked for that divorce, was it your way of hurting me? Separating me from my son because I couldn‚Äôt love you. Newsflash Ava, I really hate you‚Äù

He‚Äôs breathing hard by the time he‚Äôs done. The angry words tumble out of his mouth like bullets shooting straight at me. I feel them pierce my heart. Each word shattering my already fragile heart.

‚ÄúI-I‚Ä¶‚Äù

What‚Äôs there to say when the man you still love says he hates you?

‚ÄúJust get out of my house‚Ä¶I‚Äôll bring Noah home when my time with him is over‚Äù he snaps.

I put the divorce decree down on the counter. I was going to apologize when my phone rings. I take it out of my bag and check the caller ID.

MOTHER.

I wanted to ignore it but she never calls me unless it‚Äôs something important.

I swipe the screen and bring the phone to my ear.

I sigh ‚ÄúMothe‚Ä¶‚Äù

She doesn‚Äôt give me chance to finish my sentence.

‚ÄúGet to the hospital now! Your father has been shot‚Äù she says almost hysterically before hanging up.

My phone slips from my hand. I‚Äôm shocked.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù his voice penetrates my brain.

Heart racing, I don‚Äôt look up as I pick my phone and answer him.

‚ÄúFather has been shot‚Äù

Chapter 2

‚ÄúI need to go, could you please stay with Noah? I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll be there‚Äù I say absent mindedly as I pick up my handbag.

‚ÄúSure. I‚Äôll be there as soon as I can get my mother to come baby sit him‚Äù Rowan responds but it is drowned by the ringing in my ears.

Nothing much registers as I say goodbye to my son and leave. I get inside my car and begin to drive to the hospital. My mind completely lost in memory.

Growing up, you could say that I was emotional neglected. I was the child that none of my parents cared that much about. Father‚Äôs favorite was my older sister, Emma. He used to call her his baby girl. His princess. Mother‚Äôs favorite was my older brother Travis. He was her handsome boy. I was no one favorite. I was just Ava.

I always felt unwanted. Unwelcomed. Not only with my parents but also with my siblings. No matter what I tried to do, good grades, sports, school clubs. I always remained in the sidelines. I always felt like a stranger looking in. Never part of the big happy family.

After what happened nine years ago, the little relationship I had with my family became none existence. Travis rarely talked to me and he and father would even go to great lengths to downright snub me. Mother wasn‚Äôt much different. She only talked to me or called when she had something important to tell me. With my sister that was a completely different case. We haven‚Äôt seen or talked to each other in nine years. The last words she told me was that I was dead to her. That she no longer had a sister.

Now here I am. Driving to the hospital because father has been shot and all I feel is numb. Despite everything that has happened. Shouldn‚Äôt I be feeling something more? Maybe sadness?

What are you supposed to feel when you‚Äôre told that the father who shunned you all your life is lying in bed with a blood hole that never heals? How am I supposed to react? And is it weird that I feel nothing?

The whole drive to the hospital is reflective. As I think of my childhood and even part of my adulthood. The pain and hurt is still there. I don‚Äôt think the pain of rejection from my own family will ever go away.

That‚Äôs who I am. A rejected woman. First by my family, then by my husband and in laws. The only one who accepts me and loves me just the way I am is Noah.

It doesn‚Äôt take long to get to the hospital. We had one main big hospital in this town and I just knew that‚Äôs where my father was.

Parking my car, I get out. The cool evening air ruffles my hair. I take a deep breath and square my shoulder before entering the building.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for James Sharp, I believe he was brought in for a gunshot wound‚Äù I tell the receptionist once I get to the front desk.

‚ÄúAny relation?‚Äù she asks.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my father‚Äù

She nods her head. ‚ÄúGive me a minute.‚Äù She pauses while she types on her computer. ‚ÄúRight, he is in the ER, getting prepped for surgery. Just go straight ahead, at the end you‚Äôll see the emergency door. You‚Äôll find your family there‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks‚Äù

I turn around and follow her instruction. My heart beating with every step I take.

‚ÄòHe‚Äôs going to be okay. He‚Äôll recover soon and go back to his old self‚Äô I whisper to myself.

Despite our differences I wanted him to be well. He and I may not have a relationship but he‚Äôs loving towards Noah and that‚Äôs all I can ever ask for.

I push the door and enter. I immediately spot mother and Travis on the waiting chair. I school my features and approach them.

‚ÄúMother, Travis‚Äù I say as a way of greeting.

They both look up at me. Mother‚Äôs eyes are bloodshot from crying and her blue sundress is covered in blood. Travis‚Äô eyes are dry but you can still see how much this is affecting him. He was trying to keep it together for mother‚Äôs sake.

I take a sit next to her. ‚ÄúWhat happened and how is he doing?‚Äù

The question brings on about of fresh tears.

‚ÄúHe was shot twice on his way back from the store, right outside our house. I called the ambulance immediately and we brought him here. The doctors say one of the bullets pierced his lungs and the other his kidney. They‚Äôre preparing him for surgery‚Äù her voice catches at the end.

I nod my head. I want to comfort her. To hug her, but I don‚Äôt think my touch would be welcomed.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. Father is the strongest man I know. He‚Äôll be okay‚Äù I try to reassure her.

She doesn‚Äôt say anything. Just continues to cry.

Minutes later they bring father out. He‚Äôs dressed in a hospital gown and is lying on a hospital bed. Travis and mother immediately stand up and rush to his side.

I stay seated. I‚Äôm pretty sure my face is the last thing he wants to see. He would rather it be Emma‚Äôs.

I watch as mother cries over him. He weakly wipes her tears but they keep falling. He tells Travis something and Travis nods. His face etched in determination. Before they take him away, I see him hand over what looks like a paper to mother. This brings fresh tears running down her face.

She kisses him and they wheel him away. Mother and Travis come back and take their seats. We don‚Äôt talk as we begin the long wait.

I stand up, I pace, I sit back down. I get everyone coffee. As each minute passes, I grow more anxious and so do the rest. Two and half hour later, the doctor comes to the waiting.

From the somber look on his face, I just know that father didn‚Äôt make it. Mother senses the same thing because she starts hiccupping.

‚ÄúHe went into cardiac arrest, we tried everything we could, but we weren‚Äôt able to save him. I‚Äôm sorry for your loss‚Äù he says.

The sound that tears out of mother‚Äôs lips is animalistic. Full of pain and sorrow. Travis catches her before she falls and they both sink to the floor. Both crying at the loss.

Father was dead and I knew that meant that Emma would have to come back.

Chapter 3

I sat on the cold hospital chair breathing in then out. Mother was still sobbing and she couldn‚Äôt be consoled. My heart broke for her. I understand it isn‚Äôt easy losing the man you love in such an unexpected way.

It was still a shock. I expected him to make a full recovery but now he was dead and I had no idea how to feel.

We never saw eye to eye and even though he hated me. I loved him. He was after all my father so how could I not love him?

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Rowan asks sitting down beside me.

He arrived about an hour ago and this is the first time he talked to me since he came. I didn‚Äôt know what to do with the concern he was showing. After all he has never taken my feelings into consideration before.

‚ÄúYeah‚Äù I manage to say.

I haven‚Äôt shed a tear since we were given the news. Maybe it was belated shock or maybe I ran out of tears for him. Right now I was doing all I could to stay afloat since everyone else was breaking down.

I see feet in my peripheral vision and when I look up I find Travis staring at me. Just like always there isn‚Äôt a flicker of warmth in his eyes when he looks at me. I know what I did was a wrong but I haven‚Äôt I paid enough for that night?

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I ask him.

‚ÄúMom called Emma when dad got shot so she should be arriving soon. She still doesn‚Äôt know that dad didn‚Äôt make it‚Äù he says.

I hear Rowan‚Äôs sharp intake of air. That‚Äôs the only indication I need to know that her name still affects him. The warmth he provided just a few minutes ago turns cold and I know that once again I‚Äôve lost him.

‚ÄúI figured‚Äù I mumble because what else is there to say.

I haven‚Äôt spoken to her in years. I doubt she would want to be in the same vicinity as me given how much she hates me.

‚ÄúI expect you to be cordial and give her space‚Äù mother adds, wiping the tears from her face.

‚ÄúMother, you know what you‚Äôre asking me is nearly impossible‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs possible or not. You ran my daughter off nine years ago with your betrayal. I won‚Äôt let you do that again especially now that your father is no longer with us and we need each other‚Äù she says through clenched teeth.

I hate how they keep throwing the past in my face. Haven‚Äôt I already paid enough for the actions I took when I was young and foolish? Yet they keep punishing me.

‚ÄúIn case you‚Äôve forgotten I‚Äôm also your daughter or am I also dead to you?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt give her the chance to answer. I stand up and leave. I needed fresh air. I needed to think.

Once I‚Äôm outside I breathe in the cold air. Tears sting my eyes but I refuse to let them fall. What am I even doing here? Why did she bother calling me if she feels like she only has one daughter?

Part of me wants to walk away right now and never look back. After all, I never considered myself part of their family and they didn‚Äôt consider me as one of their own too. I should just leave and forget about them just like they seem to have forgotten about me.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam are you James Sharp‚Äôs daughter?‚Äù a nurse appears almost giving me a heart attack

I nod my head after calming down my erratic beating heart.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre needed. They‚Äôre viewing the body‚Äù she softly tells me, probably trying to be mindful of my feelings.

‚ÄúOkay, just give me a minute‚Äù

She leaves after that giving me the space to make my decision. Despite his neglect, he still provided for me so I owe him. With that, I make a decision. I would give him a proper burial, then after that I would wash my hands from them.

They could be the perfect little family. They would no longer have to put up with me like they have been doing.

Going back inside, I ask for the direction to the morgue. By the time I get there, the rest had already finished viewing his body.

I look down at him. Lying cold in the slab. He looks so at peace. Kind of like he does when he is asleep. You would think that he is just resting. Instead he was dead. His soul long departed from his body.

‚ÄúGoodbye father‚Äù I tell him.

I give him one last look before leaving the cold room. I shake off the heaviness that settles over my heart knowing he wasn‚Äôt the only one I would be saying goodbye to. They would never love me. It was time I let go of that fantasy.

I get to the waiting area and take the furthest seat. Mother was sorting out papers and bills. Travis was staring at the wall, looking lost and alone. Rowan was nowhere to be seen.

Sitting there, I think of all I have to do. It would be nearly impossible to avoid them but I was determined. This is the only way I knew to protect my peace. I was tired of being constantly in pain. Tired of my heart constantly being wounded by those around me.

I hear a commotion near me and I look up. That‚Äôs when I‚Äôm hit with her sight. She‚Äôs still as beautiful as ever. Long blonde hair, endless legs, heart shaped face and a Kardashian body that drives men crazy.

Travis is hugging her. Whispering comforting words. Something he didn‚Äôt do for me when I arrived. Just like always the longing and pain hits me, but I push it back.

They separate just as Rowan arrives. The moment he sees her, his knees buckle. I can see the way his Adam‚Äôs apple bobbles.

‚ÄúEmma?‚Äù his word is chocked as he calls her name. So many emotions put on that one name.

Her head swivels in his direction. The moment their eyes meet, everything else fades away. It‚Äôs like nothing exists but the two of them. Quicker than the Flash can move, they‚Äôre in each other‚Äôs arms.

If I though seeing Travis hug Emma hurt then I had no idea how this would tear me apart. How it would destroy me.

Emma was back. Seeing her in Rowan‚Äôs arms, no one needed to tell me the truth that was always in my face. He was still madly in love with her even after all these years.

Chapter 4

Have you ever felt like your heart has been put in a mincer? That is how I feel right now looking at them. I feel like my heart has been shredded into pieces.

If I could take the useless piece of organ and throw it away then I would. Because the pain that was tearing through me was unimaginable.

I wanted to run away. To look away, but I couldn‚Äôt. My eyes were fixed on them and no matter how I wanted to avert them it was like they were glued there. To the loving scene that was playing before me.

I watch as they separate. Rowan‚Äôs eyes soften as he stares at the love of his life. I continue to watch as he cups her face in his hands. He brings her closer to him. He doesn‚Äôt kiss her, just lays his forehead against hers.

He looks peaceful. Like he‚Äôs finally home after a long time. Like he was finally whole.

‚ÄòI‚Äôve missed you‚Äô I read the words forming on his lips.

I don‚Äôt want to imagine what would be happening between them right now if they had met under a different circumstance. If they had met when we were still married. Would he have cheated on me?

Part of me wants to deny that thought but I can‚Äôt be sure. After all, this was Emma we were talking about. Rowan would jump into the valcano and back for her sake.

Unable to take it anymore. I stand up and rush outside.

The moment I get outside the tears begin to fall. It hurt and I didn‚Äôt know how to numb or stop the pain. But who could I blame? I was the one at fault for falling in love with a man that didn‚Äôt belong to me.

‚ÄúPlease make it stop. Make the pain stop‚Äù I beg whichever higher power is there to listen to me.

There is no answer though. No reprieve.

My hands covered my body. I feel my chest constricting. I couldn‚Äôt get enough air into my lungs no matter what I tried. I felt like I was slowly dying. Slowly fading.

‚ÄúThis is what happens when you want a man that doesn‚Äôt belong to you‚Äù his mocking voice penetrates the fog.

‚ÄúWhat do you want Travis‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre here to mock me or warn me to stay away from your precious little sister then you can walk your ass back to the hospital where your family is. There is nothing here for you‚Äù I wipe my tear stained eyes and put my mask back in place.

I won‚Äôt let him see me cry. I won‚Äôt give them the chance to see me break.

He‚Äôs surprised at my words. The shock is etched on his face. I guess he never expected me to talk back at him.

‚ÄúI was just making sure you to understand that Rowan always belonged to Emma. Your selfishness took him away from her but now they can be together. I hope you won‚Äôt get in the way of their happiness. They‚Äôre long overdue‚Äù

I let out a sarcastic laugh.

‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt get in anyone‚Äôs way ever again. After this, none of you will have to see or put up with me anymore‚Äù I mumble bitterly.

He stares at me. His brows pinched in confusion. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

I was tired and all I wanted was to go to sleep and forget this day ever happened. I‚Äôll cry myself to sleep then wake up feeling refreshed and ready to face the next few days.

‚ÄúTell mother I‚Äôll be by to help with burial preparations, that‚Äôs if she even wants my help. And tell your sister I said Hi‚Äù

With that, I walk away. Heading towards my car. I can hear Travis calling my name but I don‚Äôt bother to turn around. I just wanted to go home and break apart in peace.

I get into my car and drive home. Rowan told me that Noah was with his mother. I didn‚Äôt want to deal yet with another person that hated my guts. He was safe, so I‚Äôll just pick him tomorrow.

I get home in record time. Being there alone just reminded me how truly alone I am. I have no one to comfort me or look after me. No one to love me. I have absolutely no one except for Noah.

Fresh tears start falling down my face.

I‚Äôm so tired of crying yet I can‚Äôt seem to stop. If only I could go back in time and change things. Maybe right now I would be married to a man that actually loves me.

But that‚Äôs the things about the past. Once it‚Äôs happened, you can never change it.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It‚Äôs three days since father died and everyone is in turmoil. It came as shock to everyone. He was a well known and loved man. So everyone was feeling his loss.

I haven‚Äôt seen Rowan since that day. He has called though multiple times but I ignored his calls. He was probably all loved up and in Emma‚Äôs arms right now. She has probably even moved in with him already. I didn‚Äôt need him rubbing that in my face.

Shaking those bitter thoughts, I focus on zipping my black dress.

‚ÄúMommy?‚Äù Noah‚Äôs voice comes from behind me.

I turn to find him with tears in his eyes. I am on my knees so that I am on eye level with him.

‚ÄúWhat is it my love?‚Äù I ask him.

‚ÄúI miss him so much. We were supposed to go fishing with this Saturday‚Äù his voice catches and my heart breaks at his pain.

James Sharp may have been a terrible father to me but he was a great grandfather to my son.

I hug Noah to my chest and whisper comforting words as his tears soaked my dress.

‚ÄúI know that you miss him but he is with angels now and he will always look after you from above. Remember he can never be truly gone because he lives in here‚Ä¶‚Äù I touch his chest. ‚ÄúAnd here‚Äù I touch his head.

‚ÄúBesides, he wouldn‚Äôt want you crying. Do you want to make him sad?‚Äù I gently ask and he shakes his head.

‚ÄúGood, here is what we‚Äôre going to do. Instead of being sad, we‚Äôre going to remember all the wonderful memories we had with him, okay?‚Äù

I have very few good memories with him but Noah had a lot. I was going to help him hold tight to those.

‚ÄúOkay‚Äù

I wipe the tears from his face and stand up. Picking my purse, I hold out my hand out for him. He takes it and looks up at me.

‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs go give you grandpa a proper sendoff‚Äù

He gives me a small smile and with that we leave. It was time to say goodbye.

Chapter 5

Nothing about the day spelled disaster. The sun was shining and everything seemed to be well in place as I drove down the familiar streets.

The chapel was fully packed when we arrived. Almost everyone had come to pay their last respects.

I surveyed the place and was satisfied to see everything was in place. None of the others had been much help when it came to the burial preparation. I was the one that was left to shoulder the weight of everything.

I didn‚Äôt complain though. I took it as a chance for me to reciprocate what he‚Äôd done for me. After all, he had fed me, clothed me and put a room over my head.

The service was about to begin and most people were already seated. I decided to sit on the opposite side. It didn‚Äôt feel right sitting with the rest. It especially didn‚Äôt feel right sitting next to Emma.

‚ÄúMom, why are we sitting here‚Ä¶shouldn‚Äôt we sit next to grandma?‚Äù Noah asks, pointing at where the others were.

Of course we were getting weird looks but I didn‚Äôt care. After all, it wasn‚Äôt a secret that I wasn‚Äôt wholly accepted by the family after everything that happened.

‚ÄúMost people are already seated. I don‚Äôt want us to cause a fracas‚Äù I lie.

He looks like he doesn‚Äôt believe me but choses to let it go. The father arrives and the sermon begins just as I feel someone sit next to me.

I tense. I would know his presence and cologne anywhere. I don‚Äôt know what he was doing seated here. He should be with his precious Emma. In fact I would prefer if he were there.

Crap, I sound bitter. Which I was. Bitter, angry and hurt.

‚ÄúDad‚Äù Noah whisper yells, which causes a few people to turn and look at us.

I glower at them making them turn back around.

‚ÄúCan I sit between the two of you?‚Äù Noah whispers to me.

I breathe a sigh of relief. Thank goodness for small miracles. I wouldn‚Äôt have to be near his suffocating presence.

Stealthy moving us, I‚Äôm able to switch seats with him. The moment we do, I feel the tension ease up a little.

‚ÄúWe all must leave this world one day, the question is how will you leave it? Will you have made a difference? Changed it and touched the lives of those that you met along the way? Or will you leave it with regrets?‚Äù the preacher possess the question.

I can‚Äôt help but think about it. If I were to die today, who will attend my burial? Will those around me even care? Whom am I kidding? They wouldn‚Äôt. They would probably hold a celebratory feast. The only one who will be affected by my death will be Noah. Just him and no one else.

It‚Äôs honestly sad. The life I have. I don‚Äôt have any friends mostly because I hold myself back. Living under the perfect shadow that was Emma nailed in the fact that I can never be good enough for anyone. I wasn‚Äôt as beautiful as she was. Attractive as she was. Smart as she was. Loved as she was. I wasn‚Äôt perfect as Emma was. I was nothing compared to her.

Even now when we‚Äôre older, I‚Äôm still in her shadow. No one sees my pain or suffering. It‚Äôs all about Emma. Her pain is bigger than mine. Her happiness is a priority over mine. She always comes first in everyone‚Äôs mind while I‚Äôm left chasing after leftovers of their affection.

‚ÄúMommy‚Äù Noah‚Äôs voice pulls me out of my thoughts.

It‚Äôs then I realize that the service was over and everyone was leaving.

‚ÄúAva, you okay?‚Äù his deep voice always makes me shiver.

I don‚Äôt want to talk to him let alone look at him but I‚Äôll have to because for the next ten years we‚Äôll be sharing Noah‚Äôs custody.

Shrugging my shoulders I stand up, without looking at him. I know it seems rude but I just can‚Äôt look at him. Not when the memory of him staring lovingly at Emma is still fresh in my mind.

‚ÄúCome on Noah, let‚Äôs go‚Äù

He jumps up and we walk towards the door. Once we‚Äôre outside we‚Äôre bombarded by a crowd of people wanting to give us their condolences. I spot some of my colleagues and wave at them.

We hadn‚Äôt buried father yet and I was already drained.

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve finally decided to show your face‚Äù Emma‚Äôs bitter voice says behind me.

I turn around to face her. Her face was blotchy and her eyes were red and puffy, but she still looked like a freaking goddess.

I sigh. I so didn‚Äôt want to face her right now.

‚ÄúNot now Emma. Can we just bury father first?‚Äù

She smiles then leans in so that I‚Äôm the only one that can hear her.

‚ÄúWe will bury him alright but let me tell you that I am here to stay. You also took my family from me all those years ago but no more. I plan to take everything back, including the man that was meant to be mine‚Äù she then steps aside and leaves just as the preacher calls us to go to back where the cemetery is.

Noah looks between me and the departing back of my sister but doesn‚Äôt say anything. I‚Äôm left shocked at her words but not really surprised.

What she doesn‚Äôt understand is that she doesn‚Äôt have to take anything back because none of them were mine to begin with. The family she‚Äôs talking about worships the ground she walks one. And Rowan? Rowan was and still is her man.

Pushing down the pain that wanted to drown me, I lead Noah to the place that would be father‚Äôs final resting place.

I stand a little distance from mother, Emma and Travis. They‚Äôre huddled together. Looking at them and me you would think that I was a stranger just attending the burial instead of part of them.

‚ÄúDust to dust‚Ä¶‚Äù the preacher says as they lower father‚Äôs body to the ground.

They then begin to cover his coffin with soil until he is completely buried. Mother‚Äôs wails are the loudest as she begs for father to come back to her. Emma and Travis both have silent tears running down their faces as they hold her in their arms.

I comfort Noah. Hugging him as he cries beside me. Seeing him like this brings tears to my eyes. I hate seeing him in pain. I wipe my tears away. I need to be strong for him. He needs me now.

Once again people flood us to offer their condolences. I accept them mindlessly. It was like I was there but wasn‚Äôt at the same time. By the time I come out of it, most people were already dispersed.

‚ÄúMom, there is pa and ma‚Äù he drags me pointing to Rowan‚Äôs parents.

They were there with Rowan and his twin brother Gabriel.

I stand awkwardly as he greets them. They look at me in passing but don‚Äôt say anything. We both know that I wasn‚Äôt their choice for their son.

‚ÄúCan I get snacks with them?‚Äù Noah asks and I nod.

He hasn‚Äôt eaten in hours so he was hungry. Once they leave, we are left standing awkwardly beside each other. Now that his focus wasn‚Äôt occupied by Noah, it was solely on Emma who was standing a few feet from us.

I was about to excuse myself when I hear a screeching of tires. Everything happened so fast. Men with guns opened fire. The minute they started the chaos I saw Rowan dive for Emma.

I stood shocked as I watched him protect her with his body.

I can‚Äôt believe he abandoned me to protect her. Why was I even surprised? This just proved that I‚Äôll never be his priority. Seeing him protect her with his life completely broke something inside me.

‚ÄúWatch out!‚Äù A man with a bullet-proof jacket shouted at me.

He pushed me out of the way, but it was already too late. Something pierced my skin and I fell from the impact of the hit. My breath knocked out of me.

‚ÄúSomeone call an ambulance‚Äù he knelt down next to me and put pressure on the wound.

I was confused, dizzy and in pain. I went to tell him I was okay but then I saw blood soaking my dress and his hands. I hated the sight blood.

‚ÄúOh god‚Ä¶Noah‚Äù I whispered.

He was my last thought right before everything faded into darkness.

Chapter 6

Rowan

There is something that happens inside you when you see your ex-wife, the mother of your son, shot and bleeding on the cold cemetery ground. Something I never thought I would feel towards Ava.

When I saw the men with guns pointing at us, I didn‚Äôt give it a second thought. I knew Noah was safe with my parents so my instincts took over and I dived for Emma. I would die for her and I was prepared to do just that.

I was relieved when the shooters ran after seeing the police but my relief was short lived when one of the officers shouted for an ambulance. I turned around wondering who was hurt, only I didn‚Äôt expect it to be Ava and seeing her hurt almost brought me to my knees.

It was a flurry of events after that. The ambulance arrived and the officer refused to let Ava go until he made sure she was safely in the able arms of the doctor.

I was mad at his reluctance to let her go, she was my wife, I mean ex-wife but more importantly I was mad at myself. I should have protected her. If something worse had happened to Ava, how would I have explained it to Noah? How would I justify the fact that I had failed to protect his mother?

So here I was pacing back and forth in the waiting room. Worried to death because we hadn‚Äôt gotten a word since Ava was rushed to the emergency room. No one had come out to inform us of the prognosis.

‚ÄúPlease let her be okay‚Äù Kate, her mother whispered.

This is the first time I‚Äôve heard any emotion in her voice when she talked about Ava. I guess losing her husband and then almost losing her daughter softened her a bit.

We were all here with the exception of Noah. Travis was seated next to Kate who was next to Emma.

I sat down unable to control the anxiety inside me. I needed her to be okay for Noah‚Äôs sake. I kept telling myself.

I don‚Äôt know for how long we were waiting, but when I looked up I saw Ava. She was over at the nurse‚Äôs station handing off papers. Her left arm was in a sling as she took her credit card and put it in her bag.

With difficulty, she managed to get out her phone, while still holding her bag. You could see that it wasn‚Äôt an easy task by the frown on her face.

‚ÄúAva‚Äù I called as she was about to walk past us. Her eyes still on her phone.

She looked up. I immediately noticed that something about her was different. I couldn‚Äôt place my finger on it but it was there.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here, did someone else get hurt?‚Äù she asked. Her voice flat and devoid of any emotion.

‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù her mom asked instead of replying.

‚ÄúUnfortunately for you, I‚Äôm not dead yet‚Äù

Her answer took everyone by surprise. Not only because of how she worded, but because of how cold it was.

I decide to cut in. ‚ÄúWhere are you going‚Äù

‚ÄúHome‚Äù was her only answer.

‚ÄúYour hand is in a sling, you can‚Äôt drive‚Äù I reason.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I called an Uber‚Äù

‚ÄúAva we need to talk. It‚Äôs about you father‚Äù Kate whispers making Ava turn to her mother.

There was something missing. I could see it in her eyes.

Coldly she stared at her mother. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see what that has to do with me, the last time I checked, he didn‚Äôt consider me his daughter‚Äù

A sob tore from her mother‚Äôs throat but Ava doesn‚Äôt pay any attention to her. It‚Äôs like she had switched off all her feelings leaving nothing behind but a cruel familiarity.

1mjwl2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mjwl2s/iris_dating_app_in_the_uk/,Iris Dating App in the UK,"I feel like I (M33) am the canary in the coal mine with a dating app for once and I wanted to figure out if it's me that's in the wrong here or if others have the same experience.

I downloaded Iris Dating App last night and find it impossible to use. I understand that their formula is meant to be different, using AI and choices made on the app exclusively to determine who I will be instantly attracted to. But the thing that is crippling my interest in the app is that even when I change my distance to the maximum, to 100 miles, I don't have a single profile to look at.

Even an app with a modest usership (I think it's around 4 million people worldwide), I find it a real anomaly that there isn't a single person within 100miles that I could connect with. I like in a fairly large city, 20 minutes WALKING distance from the city centre, a city which has a metro population of well over 1 million people. How on earth is there zero people using this app? Is it bait and switch, pay for proximity?

I can find nothing online except the companies own videos explaining 'how it works.' They say that they know it can be frustrating to make decisions on profiles when they are at ""inconvenient"" distances. I'm sorry but seeing beautiful women from Columbia, the Philippines, Russia and so on isn't just frustrating, it's downright pointless. Now, the romantic in me isn't afraid of putting in effort, traveling a bit for dates, spending money on an app that works, but in my heart of hearts, do I think I'll be flying to the other side of the planet or asking someone to do the same on a hope and a prayer?

I believe that the attraction principals that the app is based on are clever, and indeed, there are loads of great profiles that seem genuine, have lots of variety in information and images that I believe the aren't bots/catfishes. But what is the point in seeing them if there is no chance I'll ever be able to ask a single one of them to dinner, coffee or any kind of in person date? 

Is the app simply to much in its infancy or am I just not getting it? Has anyone, particularly from the UK used Iris? I would also welcome feedback from people in any part of the world that has a decent user base. Do you have the same problem, lots of unrealistic, unmaintainable distances and then one or two from your country/state/city show up randomly? 

I was excited at first at the novelty of how they determine attraction but if I'm in a way head of time for it being usable in the UK, I get it. I might come back to it if I'm still single in a year or so. But right now, given that the closest profile I saw was in Paris (not a match, simply a profile I was asked to make a decision on) I don't think it's viable at all, although I will be happy to be proven wrong.",2,1754562990.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I kept it super simple: hammock + bug net, light tarp, and a small campfire setup. Temps dropped a bit at night but nothing uncomfortable with a decent underquilt. No major hikes, just walked in about a half mile from the car.

I brought a book, made coffee by the water in the morning, and just took in the silence. No distractions, no notifications, just me and the breeze.

Blair was so grateful to be home. She just didn‚Äôt understand the demon that had possessed her boss during their recent business trip. He had driven everyone hard. They arrived home one day earlier than planned, but she was glad to be away from him.

She had expected to return to the office with him. To her surprise, he gave her the rest of the afternoon off. Maybe he‚Äôd decided they both needed a break. That was fine by her.

Lately, he‚Äôd been a real shithead. Short-tempered and demanding. When he dropped her off at her front door, she almost flipped him the bird. She paused, unsure whether he‚Äôd catch the gesture in the rear-view mirror.

Roman had this uncanny ability to sense everything. It was almost like he had eyes in the back of his head. You‚Äôd think being gorgeous would make him a bit easier to work with. But no. If anything, it made him more of an ass. He was hot, and he knew it. Most everyone always fell at his feet trying to please the man.

She didn‚Äôt know what was going on. Roman had seemed more irritable in the past few months. He‚Äôd been rubbing her the wrong way. Of the two years she‚Äôd worked for him, these last two months had been the worst. If he didn‚Äôt pay her so well, or if she didn‚Äôt need the job so badly, maybe she would tell him where to go.

Blair shook her head. That wasn‚Äôt true. Despite his sometimes shitty attitude, Roman did look after his staff. The benefits at Kingston‚Äôs were great. People put up with more for the right perks.

The office offered excellent medical and dental coverage. There was always childcare within the building, and the company was cutting back on maternity leave. It was a win-win for Kingston.

Blair picked up her case and headed for the front door of the townhouse she shared with her cousin Laura and her fianc√© Dan.

She checked her watch as she reached the front door. Dan wouldn‚Äôt be home for a few hours. She planned to surprise him with a romantic dinner.

Laura was rarely home at night, always out partying. Her cousin was a model-not a supermodel, but still gorgeous. She knew how to make the most of it. Blair, on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt interested in clothes or makeup. She was more into books.

They had both moved to the city for different reasons. Laura to follow her modeling career and for Blair, it had been a chance to work for a great company like Kingston Industries. Under normally the great man himself Roman Kingston. The company had their fingers in so many pies, Blair was never bored. Even when Roman was being his most demanding. She loved her job.

Fishing for her keys. She juggled her briefcase, handbag, and suitcase. Once the key was in the lock, it turned easily. Blair pushed the door open. Stepping inside, she put her handbag and suitcase down at the bottom of the stairs. Before heading into the lounge room where she kept a desk. Sitting her briefcase on top.

Blair turned to make her way to the kitchen, pondering what to prepare for dinner. As she walked past the foot of the stairs, a sudden noise from upstairs caused her to halt in her tracks. Was there someone else in the house? Had she returned home to an intruder? Filled with panic, Blair took a step towards the front door, ready to flee.

However, at that moment, she realized something. Laura. Unlike Blair and Dan, Laura didn‚Äôt adhere to their typical working hours. She often slept late and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. It wasn‚Äôt the first time Blair had found her slumped on the front steps as she was leaving for work in the morning. Blair wasn‚Äôt sure if she should call out now. What if it wasn‚Äôt her cousin?

Her eyes scanned the room for something to defend herself with‚Ä¶ just in case. Her gaze landed on her late father‚Äôs baseball bat, which she always kept near the front door when she was home alone at night. It made her feel safer.

She grabbed the bat, weighting it in her hand for a moment. Before she set foot on the stairs, she paused, wondering if any of them creaked. She couldn‚Äôt remember. Taking a deep breath to steady her racing heart, Blair ascended the stairs slowly, step by step.

When she reached the landing, she stopped, straining to listen.

‚ÄúPlease be Laura. Please be Laura, and not some masked man waiting to jump out at me,‚Äù she muttered under her breath.

The hallway stretched ahead, with four doors. Three led to the bedrooms, and one opened to the shared bathroom. The only door ajar was the one to her and Dan‚Äôs bedroom. The others were shut. But to get to her bedroom, she‚Äôd have to pass the other doors.

That‚Äôs when she heard it, the unmistakable sound of a giggle from Laura, followed by a low, male groan. Relief flooded her chest. It wasn‚Äôt a burglar. Laura had brought someone home.

Just as Blair was about to turn away and leave, she heard the voice of the man Laura was with.

‚ÄúGod, yes,‚Äù the voice groaned.

Blair froze, her heart pounding. No. It couldn‚Äôt be.

‚ÄúLaura, you‚Äôre so fucking hot,‚Äù Dan‚Äôs voice came from their bedroom.

Her eyes widened. Dan. In their bed. With Laura. Blair‚Äôs stomach lurched.

This couldn‚Äôt be happening. She moved quietly down the hall until she stood outside her bedroom door, praying this was all some kind of terrible misunderstanding.

With a trembling hand, she pushed the door open.

The sight that greeted her was like a punch to the gut. She staggered backward, her mind unable to process what she was seeing.

There, in the middle of the bed, was Dan, flat on his back, with Laura straddling him, completely naked. She was moving up and down on him, her hands gripping his chest hair. From this angle, Blair could see Dan‚Äôs cock thrusting in and out of Laura. It felt like she was watching a scene from a porn film.

Dan‚Äôs hands gripped Laura‚Äôs waist and ass, guiding her movements.

‚ÄúErr, yes, fuck me harder,‚Äù Laura moaned.

Blair lifted a hand to her mouth to stop herself from crying out. No, no, no, no.

Dan‚Äôs grip tightened on Laura‚Äôs ass, spreading her cheeks wider.

Blair had never seen Laura naked before, not that it mattered when she was currently riding Blair‚Äôs fianc√©.

How could she do this? They had both watched Laura‚Äôs father, Peter, cheat repeatedly on Laura‚Äôs mother, creating a toxic home life. Blair had lived with them after losing her parents in a plane crash ten years ago. She had thought if anyone would understand the devastation of betrayal, it would be Laura.

This had to be a nightmare. Blair pinched herself, hard, as the sting registered immediately. Not a nightmare.

Dan had always hated Laura. He‚Äôd called her a slut. Mocked her outfits. Said she was shallow, incapable of real conversation.

Was it all a lie? Had he been jealous of the men in her life? Was that why?

One thing was certain, Dan‚Äôs mother, Paula, would never accept Laura as a suitable wife for her son.

But none of that mattered now. What was she supposed to do? How did someone handle this? It was like a scene from a B-grade movie.

She couldn‚Äôt pretend she hadn‚Äôt seen it. She didn‚Äôt want Dan anymore‚Ä¶ not now, not after this. Taking him back would be disgusting.

How long had this been going on?

They had been living together for five months. Dan had moved in with her and Laura to save money before the wedding. Had he been fucking Laura the whole time?

‚ÄúLaura, you are so goddamn tight,‚Äù Dan groaned, arching his back.

‚ÄúIs my pussy better than Blair‚Äôs?‚Äù Laura asked, riding him harder.

Blair‚Äôs heart stopped. Did she know Blair was standing here? Had she asked that on purpose?

Blair bit into her hand to keep from making a sound. She had given Dan her virginity. He had known what that meant to her. Knowing that he had done this.

She hadn‚Äôt even planned to be home today. She had wanted to surprise him.

The surprise had been on her.

She felt sick. A cold sweat broke over her skin.

Her other hand came up, gripping the doorframe for balance. Something solid pressed against her palm. The bat.

For a fleeting second, she thought about using it. Smashing the bed, the nightstand, the both of them. But she wasn‚Äôt that person. She rested the bat against the doorframe just in case she changed her mind and used it on them.

So instead, she straightened her spine. Let the rage steel her so when she finally spoke, her voice was calm. Icy, emotionless.

‚ÄúWhile you two finish up, should I cook dinner?‚Äù

# Chapter Two

‚ÄúFuck me.‚Äù Dan's head came up off the bed as he pushed Laura off his body. Blair could see the horror on his face when he saw her standing at the door. He‚Äôd been caught with his pants down, or off, as it was in this case. Laura scrambled across the bed, pulling a blanket over her naked body. Her face was filled with shock, showing her cousin hadn‚Äôt known of Blair‚Äôs presence. The expression she wore was incredibly real and impossible to fake.

‚ÄúNo thanks. Looks like Laura has taken care of that for you.‚Äù Blair was surprised how calm she sounded. When all she truly wanted to do was scream and shout and throw things. What would it accomplish? She would still have a broken relationship.

‚ÄúBlair! What are you doing home today?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs cock was wet and laying limp against his leg. Having his fiance walk in on him mustn‚Äôt be a turn on, it would seem.

Blair lifted an eyebrow at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you are worried about? Might be an idea to cover up.‚Äù

Blair was watching Dan with narrowed eyes. She had loved him, but the person she saw now was ugly to her. It didn‚Äôt matter anymore that he was very attractive. To her, he was ugly. No one should cheat on someone they claimed to love. Even if someone had held a gun to her head, she would have refused. It was a shame Dan hadn‚Äôt felt the same. As far as she could see, Laura hadn‚Äôt needed to force him. Hearing them talk during the act had told her that.

Blair put the bat down, resting it against the wall near the door. Just in case. She told herself that she wouldn‚Äôt use it, but who knew? Crimes of passion that had to have come from somewhere. Normal everyday people committing a crime in the heat of the moment. So it was safer if she put it down. Blair then crossed her arms across her chest. Looking back to see Dan had gotten off the bed and was pulling on his work pants.

She flicked her eyes to Laura. The bitch now had a smug look on her face. It had replaced the look of shock. Why?

Blood was roaring in her ears as she came to terms with the total destruction of her personal life. She never wanted to see him again, but she and Dan both worked for Kingston. She had applied first. Dan hadn‚Äôt joined the company until a year later.

Blair decided then and there she would not be leaving her job. It was her only concrete thing she could hang onto, then she was keeping it. It wasn‚Äôt like they work directly together.

Dan took a step towards her, reaching out his hand. ‚ÄúBaby..‚Äù

Blair took a step back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare touch me?‚Äù Not only could she not stomach it, but who knows where that hand had been?

The venom in Blair's voice brought him up short. He turned to look at Laura before returning his eyes to her face. Blair knew she was pale. Who wouldn‚Äôt be?

‚ÄúYou have to believe me. This was a one time thing. It will never happen again. It meant nothing.‚Äù Dan pleaded with her.

Blair could see the look on Laura's face. Even before seeing it, she knew he was lying. Dan had a tell. When he lied, his right eyebrow would go up. Before today, the lies had never been a big deal, just little things. Had she noticed it when he had talked about Laura in the past? Blair wasn‚Äôt sure. Because sometimes the sub-conscious mind could even fool ourselves.

‚ÄúDo you know Dan? It doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Blair angled her chin up as her nails dug into her palm. ‚ÄúThis one time was all it took.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat.. No, Blair baby please, I love you.‚Äù Dan tried to take her in his arms.

Blair moved quickly, picked up the bat, and swung it so the end pressed up against his chest, pushing him back and holding him at bay. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it.‚Äù

Dan looked down at the bat, raising his hands back at his shoulder level. ‚ÄúPlease, she seduced me. You know what a slut she is. I was missing you.‚Äù

They both heard the gasp from the bed. Before Laura responded. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lying Blair. This has been going on for months. Soon after, he moved in.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, you dumb bitch.‚Äù Dan turned to yell at her. Before saying to Blair. ‚ÄúShe is lying.‚Äù

Blair shrugged. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. It only took the one time Dan.‚Äù She nudged him with the baseball bat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call Laura a dumb bitch. I may never forgive her for this, but you were the one in a relationship, Dan, not her.‚Äù Blair could see Laura sliding out of the bed, scrambling around for her clothing, still holding the sheet to her breasts. ‚ÄúIf you think she is a slut, what the fuck does that make you?‚Äù Blair knew she would not feel clean even if she had ten showers. This was going to take time.

Blair knew she couldn‚Äôt deal with anymore right now. She needed to leave before they were both dressed. She needed to think, to process. Turning on her heel, she ran down the stairs. Quickly grabbing the suitcase, handbag. Blair only just remembered the briefcase as she was about to leave through the front door.

‚ÄúYou stupid slut, why did you have to say anything?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs angry voice came from upstairs

Blair rushed to her desk, picked up the briefcase and stood at the front door, ready to leave. Knowing once she walked through it, she wasn‚Äôt coming back. She had no idea where she was going, but anywhere was better than here.

Following Dan‚Äôs insult came Laura's high-pitched squeal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a slut Dan.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and your big mouth. You wanted this to happen, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Dan accused.

Blair could hear the tears in Laura's voice. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mind my mouth when it was sucking your cock.‚Äù

‚ÄúShh.‚Äù Dan was worried she was hearing their argument. ‚ÄúYou set me up, didn‚Äôt you? You knew she was coming home.‚Äù

‚ÄúDan I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù Laura cried.

If she stayed any longer, both of them would have gotten dressed and then they would come down here, and she didn‚Äôt want another confrontation.

Taking a deep breath, Blair stepped through the front door, not looking back even as she heard Dan calling her name from inside the house.

# Chapter Three

Blair waved down a taxi. She shoved open the taxi door and climbed into the backseat as quickly as she could, intent on getting out of here as fast as possible. She felt like getting drunk. But if she went to a bar alone during the day, that would be inviting trouble. She could feel the tears as they slid unchecked down her face. She had held herself together while she had confronted Dan and Laura.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù the driver asked, his voice cutting through the fog in her brain.

Where to? Good question.

Home wasn‚Äôt an option. Sutton and Keira were at work, and she didn‚Äôt want to sit in their empty apartment, replaying the image of Dan tangled in her cousin‚Äôs sheets. She needed a drink. But sitting alone in a bar in the middle of the afternoon? That felt like waving a white flag.

She hesitated, then rattled off the address of her office. At least there, she could pretend to be productive. Maybe even figure out what the hell to do next.

The taxi pulled away from the kerb and she exhaled, trying to steady herself.

The driver looked at her in the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúThere are tissues in the center compartment if you need them, hon.‚Äù

The driver‚Äôs voice was gentle, like he‚Äôd seen enough women cry in his backseat to know when to speak and when to keep quiet.

Blair grabbed a handful. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù She said before cleaning her face as best she could. It wasn‚Äôt like she wore a lot of makeup. So she might as well clean her face.

Her phone began to ring. Dan.

She still pulled it out of her to check. Her stomach clenched as she stared at the screen, his name glowing in bright white letters.

She could just imagine the first words he would say.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, just let me talk to you.‚Äù

Lies. Excuses. The same bullshit men always spewed when they got caught.

She set the phone to silent and shoved it back into her bag.

By the time the taxi pulled up in front of the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries, her makeup was beyond saving. She reached into her purse, dug out a crumpled twenty, and handed it to the driver.

‚ÄúBe honest,‚Äù she said, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúDo I look like a woman who just found out her fianc√© is screwing her cousin?‚Äù

The driver hesitated, giving her a careful once-over. ‚ÄúYour eyes are a little red, honey, but it‚Äôs hardly noticeable.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúAre you going to be okay?‚Äù

The unexpected kindness nearly undid her.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Better to find out now, right? Just a little dump on the road of life.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt sure who she was trying to convince the taxi driver or herself.

After paying the driver in cash, she climbed out of the taxi, hoisted her suitcase onto the curb and took a deep breath. Blair checked her phone screen to see Dan had called her six times and left six messages on her voicemail. Uninterested in what he had to say for himself, she slid the phone away in her handbag.

Blair turned toward the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries. Roman had bought the building five years ago. The top eight floors belonged to Kingston, the lower three rented out to smaller businesses. With the way the company was expanding, she wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they took over the whole thing eventually.

She walked inside, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.

‚ÄúMiss Warner, Can I help you?‚Äù Blair blinked. Maggie, one of the receptionists, had stepped out from behind the lobby front desk, her gaze flicking over Blair.

Maggie stepped forward, taking the suitcase from her. In the same hand, she was still holding the bat. Blair had completely forgotten that she was even holding it in her hand.

Blair had walked into the office looking like she was about to commit a felony. She was relieved, though. It was something she wouldn‚Äôt need to retrieve later.

Blair exhaled, relieved. ‚ÄúThanks, Maggie. Can I leave everything here while I freshen up?‚Äù She was surprised her voice sounded so... normal.

‚ÄúOf course, Miss Warner.‚Äù Maggie‚Äôs eyes darted to the bat again.

‚ÄúBlair, please. How many times do I have to tell you?‚Äù Roman preferred first names, but some staff-especially the newer ones-struggled with that.

More with Roman than with her.

Maggie smiled, taking the suitcase, briefcase, and bat.

Blair headed across the foyer to the restroom.

Inside, she went straight to the mirrors. The cab driver hadn‚Äôt just been kind. She really didn‚Äôt look that bad. She pulled a makeup wipe from her bag and cleaned off the last remnants of mascara. A quick dusting of powder, some lip gloss, a little eyeliner.

She pinched her cheeks. People always said that added color, but she didn‚Äôt see a difference.

Her blue eyes were still a little red, but there wasn‚Äôt much she could do about that. She pulled out a brush, freed her long, wavy blonde hair from its bun, and redid it neatly. Good enough.

She left the restroom, retrieved her belongings from Maggie, and headed to the elevators. As she waited, she tried to recall Roman‚Äôs schedule. Did he have any meetings this afternoon?

Then it hit her. He shouldn‚Äôt have been home today. So no meetings were scheduled in his calendar.

She sighed. Her brain was fried. But walking in on your fianc√© shagging your cousin would do that to anyone.

The thought made her frown.

How often had they been doing this? Dan had been at home during a workday. She traveled occasionally for work, but not that often. If their affair had been going on for months, they had to have been meeting up on company time.

The elevator arrived. A woman she didn‚Äôt recognize stepped in with her.

Blair offered a polite, strained smile. When the woman got off at the second floor, Blair leaned back against the wall, staring at nothing.

Should she tell Roman about Dan? It would feel like sour grapes-tattling just because he cheated. But he was also ripping off the company. No way could he get home, have sex with Laura, and get back to the office during a lunch break.

The elevator dinged open. Blair inhaled deeply before stepping onto the executive floor.

Kara, the receptionist on the executive floor, looked up. ‚ÄúHey, Blair. I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be in today.‚Äù

Blair smiled. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt planning to be, but I figured I‚Äôd get a jump on the meeting notes for Roman. Is he in?‚Äù

Kara shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, he left a little while ago. Called to have his calls held.‚Äù

Blair almost sagged in relief. She wouldn‚Äôt have to face him just yet.

‚ÄúThanks, Kara.‚Äù

She went to her office, shut the door, and sank into her chair.

Blair rested her head on the desk. Shit. She felt like a wrecking ball had just split her world in two.

How could he? But even worse than that, how could Laura?

The childish problems they had all had as kids, Blair had thought, they had grown out of that. Laura had always been a spoiled brat. Taking what wasn‚Äôt hers.

The problem was her parents, Blair‚Äôs aunt and uncle, doted on her and gave her everything she wanted. But when they had moved to the city two years ago, Laura hadn‚Äôt been that bad or by now Blair would have moved in with her sisters. She hadn‚Äôt when Sutton had come back from Europe because her sister Keira had just finished university. Keira had moved in with Sutton. She would have felt guilty leaving Laura on her own to move in with her sisters. What was the point, anyway? She and Dan had planned on getting a place of their own once they were married.

Lifting her head, Blair looked down at the ring on her finger. The engagement ring Dan had given her.

It wasn‚Äôt big. She hadn‚Äôt wanted big. She would make sure he got it back. He could sell it. Because she was sure Laura would want a big flashy ring. She had made fun of Blair‚Äôs ring.

Taking it off, Blair was about to throw it across the room. No, just in case it went missing. Opening the top drawer of her desk, Blair dropped it in, slamming it shut. She needed a drink. Standing, Blair went into Roman‚Äôs office, where she knew he kept a bottle of scotch. She wasn‚Äôt much of a spirit drinker, but anything would do.

Roman office was a statement of the man himself. Everything was big, strong, and masculine. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget intimidating.‚Äù Blair said to the empty room.

Going to his desk, she opened the bottom drawer and pulled out the bottle of scotch that Roman kept there. Taking it, she sat down on his Chestfield lounge near the window. She opened the bottle and took a drink. Almost coughing it back up. ‚ÄúHoly shit, this shit burns.‚Äù Blair knew it was an expensive bottle Roman only liked the best.

The problem was, it was straight. Why did he like this shit straight? This time, when she put the bottle to her mouth, Blair made sure to sip it this time. Nope, that didn‚Äôt help. But it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the first drink. So she had another. Laying her head back against the lounge. She had come here to think. What was her next move?

Lifting her hand so she could see the dial on her watch, Blair saw it was 3:15pm. She couldn‚Äôt call Sutton or Keira. Not yet. Let them get home from work. Blair planned to ask Sutton and Keira to assist her in organizing getting her stuff from the apartment. Although she didn‚Äôt want to put too much pressure on her older sister, Sutton. She was six months pregnant, and it hadn‚Äôt been an easy pregnancy.

Men. Why were they assholes? First, her boss for being so arrogant and intimidating and sometimes rude. Then Dan, who had been cheating on her with her cousin Laura for months. How low was that? Then there was Luca, the father of Sutton‚Äôs baby. Who had left her high and dry and pregnant?

Then she would see about crashing at their place until she could find somewhere. Their place wasn‚Äôt big enough for three adults and a baby. When it arrived. But it would be great to spend some time with her sisters. Eat ice cream and talk shit about men.

Although Sutton didn‚Äôt even talk about the man that had gotten her pregnant. It was a topic she refused to discuss. Even when their aunt Viv and uncle Peter had demanded answers. Blair lifted the bottle again to her mouth. Only she and Keira knew his first name.

The phone started ringing on Roman‚Äôs desk. Blair tried to ignore it, but as soon as it stop ringing it started again. Blair shifted to the edge of the lounge, rising to her feet. The room seemed to tilt ever so slightly, prompting a quick ‚ÄúOops.‚Äù to escape her lips.

After regaining her balance, she made her way over to the phone and lifted the receiver.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she greeted into the handset. Not very professional, she thought.

‚ÄúRoman please.‚Äù Blair knew the voice. It was Claire Robertson. Roman‚Äôs little piece of fluff. It was the best way to describe Claire. She had this stupid girly voice that set Blair‚Äôs teeth on edge.

‚ÄúRoman isn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Blair put a hand on Roman‚Äôs desk to help stop the swaying of the room.

‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù Claire asked.

‚ÄúHow the hell should I know?‚Äù Blaire was surprised by her answer. Shit, where had that come from?

‚ÄúYou are his secretary.‚Äù Blair could hear the anger in the other woman‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúYes, but I‚Äôm not his keeper and I sure as hell don‚Äôt own a crystal ball. Call or message his mobile.‚Äù Blair was over this conversation.

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt answering his mobile hasn‚Äôt for days.‚Äù Claire whined.

Blair‚Äôs lips parted slightly. Oh.

That was Roman‚Äôs move. He didn‚Äôt argue, didn‚Äôt make dramatic exits. He just started to avoid before making a clean break. If Claire hadn‚Äôt heard from him in days, it was over. She just didn‚Äôt know it yet.

The little devil on her shoulder made her do it. But Blair couldn‚Äôt help the next words. ‚ÄúWell, one of two things has happened. Either you‚Äôre about to get dumped, or he‚Äôs dead. Either way, flowers will be involved.‚Äù

Blair sighed when she heard the shocked gasp from the other end of the phone, the scotch warming her veins, and loosening her tongue. ‚ÄúLook, Claire, let‚Äôs be honest. He‚Äôs not marriage material. Find someone new.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt wait for a reply, just hung up and dropped the receiver back into place.

She collapsed back onto the Chesterfield, lifting the bottle to her lips again.

Her own problems resurfaced to haunt her. How was she so blind? How did she not pick up on the signs? She wasn‚Äôt an idiot. Dan was a salesman. He had sold her the dream of happily ever after. She had just been blind to the cracks in their relationship.

Not only that, it looked like she had been missing something in her sex life. If what she had witnessed between Dan and Laura was any indication of how the act should be. She enjoyed it well enough, but it wasn‚Äôt something that made her cry out like Laura had been doing. Was that to stroke his ego? Should she have been doing that? The thing was, she didn‚Äôt know.

Dan had been her only lover. It had been his job to teach her.

Blair sighed, lifting the bottle again-only to pause when she noticed two tall, blurry figures standing in front of her.

Wait. No. Not two. Just one.

Blair squinted. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

She tried to sit up, bringing the bottle to her mouth, but before she could take another sip, it was plucked from her hand.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she protested. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs mine. If you want one, go find your own.‚Äù

She blinked, trying to focus.

The man standing in front of her-the one holding the bottle-came into view.

‚ÄúRoman?‚Äù

‚ÄúBlair,‚Äù he said, his voice unreadable. ‚ÄúWhat have you done to yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, slurring slightly, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs... pretty obvious. As you can see, I‚Äôm getting shit-faced.‚Äù She reached for the bottle. ‚ÄúNow give it back so I can finish the job.‚Äù

Roman stepped away, placing the bottle on his desk. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve had enough.‚Äù

Blair frowned. ‚ÄúYou know... sometimes you can be an asshole. No-most of the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do believe you‚Äôre going to regret this tomorrow.‚Äù

Then, to her surprise, he sat down beside her.

# Chapter Four

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just an asshole, but a shithead too... always thought so,‚Äù Blair slurred, her tongue feeling too heavy in her mouth. She knew she shouldn‚Äôt be saying this, but she couldn‚Äôt stop herself.

Roman chuckled, leaning back. ‚ÄúI think I should get you some coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äô want it.‚Äù Blair waved a hand dismissively, nearly hitting herself in the face. ‚ÄúI want... a man that ain‚Äôt a cheatin‚Äô rat.‚Äù Her eyes drifted over him, and despite her best efforts, she noticed-really noticed-how attractive he was. ‚ÄúDid you... did you ever cheat on your ex-wife?‚Äù

She‚Äôd met Jessica once. It hadn‚Äôt been a pleasant experience.

Roman‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change, but his voice softened. ‚ÄúNot all men cheat, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-why‚Äôd she leave you then?‚Äù Her head tilted as if she were trying to piece together a puzzle.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of reasons marriages fall apart,‚Äù Roman said, dragging a hand down his face. ‚ÄúNot all of them have to do with cheating on the man‚Äôs part.‚Äù

It took Blair a moment to process that. Then her eyes widened. ‚ÄúShe cheated on you?‚Äù she whispered, as if it were some great secret. ‚ÄúWas she an idiot?‚Äù

Her boss was gorgeous-thick dark hair, intense gray eyes, chiseled cheekbones. And his body... well, from what she could see, it was fine. Not that she‚Äôd ever been interested before. She‚Äôd always been with Dan. Had been with Dan.

Roman reached over, gently lifting her chin with two fingers when her mouth fell open. ‚ÄúI worked a lot. Some would say I drove her to it.‚Äù

Blair blinked at him, then shook her head, making herself dizzy. ‚ÄúThass not an excuse... nope... no, no, no.‚Äù She dropped her head back onto the couch, exhaling loudly. ‚ÄúShould get a divorce before that... cheaters... all of ‚Äòem...‚Äù

Roman studied her with an amused expression. ‚ÄúYou know, this is the most I‚Äôve ever seen you relax around me.‚Äù

Blair lifted a hand lazily. ‚ÄúThass ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre... you‚Äôre normally soooo difficult to deal wit‚Äô‚Äù she muttered, barely able to get the words out.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt apologize for that.‚Äù His lips twitched. ‚ÄúI expect the best. That‚Äôs why this company is where it is today.‚Äù

Blair made a sound that was half a grunt, half a laugh. ‚ÄúSuppose so...‚Äù Her head felt heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

Roman let her sit in silence for a moment before asking, ‚ÄúWhat happened, Blair?‚Äù

She turned her head to look at him, her vision slightly unfocused. ‚ÄúI was an idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Because you trusted the wrong person?‚Äù

Blair let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúDan an‚Äô I grew up together, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúI... I was always going home... back home, all the time, when I moved to th‚Äô city for this job. He... he got a job at Kingston‚Äôs, and I was happy ‚Äòbout it. Now I wish he wasn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Her voice wobbled, but she refused to cry. Not again. Not for Dan.

‚ÄúSo, the wedding‚Äôs off?‚Äù Roman gestured to her bare finger.

Blair lifted her hand, staring at it for a second before letting it flop back onto her lap. ‚ÄúYep. We didn‚Äôt even have a date set.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho was holding it up?‚Äù

She blinked at him. Why was he askin‚Äô so many questions? Why was he bein‚Äô so... nice? ‚ÄúMe. He wanted to get married last year. I wasn‚Äôt ready.‚Äù

Roman‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly. ‚ÄúWhy? If you loved him, why did you want to wait?‚Äù

Blair shrugged, though it was a little sloppy. ‚ÄúIf what I saw t‚Äôday was anythin‚Äô to go by...‚Äù She trailed off, frowning. Maybe... maybe she‚Äôd always known somethin‚Äô was off. There was no passion. No fire. She‚Äôd loved Dan, but maybe not the way she was supposed to love the man she was gonna marry.

Right now, she wasn‚Äôt even sad. Just... angry.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Roman pressed, his voice gentler now.

Blair‚Äôs face scrunched up as she remembered. ‚ÄúSaw him,‚Äù she slurred. ‚ÄúH-havin‚Äô sex with... ugh.‚Äù She waved a hand, unable to finish the sentence.

Roman‚Äôs jaw tensed. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

Blair stared at him for a long moment, her head swimming with thoughts she couldn‚Äôt quite hold on to. Then, suddenly, she reached out, grabbing his tie between her fingers.

Roman froze.

Blair stared at the fabric, tracing the pattern with unfocused eyes. She didn‚Äôt know why she did it. Maybe ‚Äòcause she needed to know. Needed to feel something different.

Without another thought, she pulled at the tie, closing the space between them, and pressed her lips to his.
