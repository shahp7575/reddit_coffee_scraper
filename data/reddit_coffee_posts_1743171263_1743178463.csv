She retired last year and is single. Lives alone, no pets and an adult son who lives several hours away. When she and I meet for coffee or just to go for a walk she absolutely talks non stop. She barely takes a breath and dominates all conversations. If we are in a group she yaks on and on. We recently did a girls weekend and on the 4 hour ride there and back she never stopped and barely allowed anyone else a word. I don’t want to exclude her because I know she is lonely but sometimes I’d like a little peace and quiet around her. How do I ask her politely to stop talking so much?

1jlyq5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jlyq5g/almost_one_year_later_and_i_still_wonder/,Almost one year later and I still wonder,"Me (f27) and my ex (m27) broke up in May 2024. We were together for almost 2 years and he was my first boyfriend. Our relationship was full of ups and downs from the beginning, and I thought it came from me being anxious and insecure, but after this time I can just say other factors influenced on our downfall. We met in fall of 2021 after having just moved to the same city for university. We became friends quickly but I always felt there was something else. We would hang out a lot in his apartment just the two of us, going to the museum, for coffee, spending entire days together, and at some point we started to have ""platonic"" sleepovers at this apartment. One day we watched a movie and we cuddled, and then I stayed over. Nothing more happened, but it felt very intimate to me. After that I stayed over a couple more times and he even had a toothbrush for me. Fast forward a couple months later his ex comes over and stays with him for 3 months. I met her once and then we stopped talking. When she left he reached out again. I was a bit disappointed and sad during this time because i thought he liked me but by that point I was over it. We started to talk again and then two months later we began dating. From there, I was always very insecure because they were still friends and in contact, and I felt there was not such a long time between her leaving and us starting to date. There were some things that belonged to her in his apartment and I felt as if they were hunting me when I would see them. I guess I should have followed my instinct but no. We were almost living together 2 months in, even though I still had my apartment (this because he said he didnt liked relationships where he couldnt co-live with the person, another red flag). I really liked the attention and I was a bit naive about it. We were doing this dynamic for almost two years - a lot of ups and downs, him not understanding where I was coming from, he wanted to talk to her even if I felt bad about it, having no empathy at all. A very ugly side of me came out i feel - very insecure, sad, questioned myself a lot, let on the side a lot of the thing I liked to accommodate him, also I found myself very angry and frustrated often. I  was all in and it felt like he was also too, we discussed marriage, kids, having our own place, pets, all of that. He would always tell me he had never felt like this before with anyone and that I was the first person he saw himself with seriously. He and his ex were never serious because he always knew he would move to Europe for university and she would also need to go back to her home country in America. In April 2023, I told him I could not deal with it anymore and wanted to break up. I felt bad about how things started between us and I was just not comfortable with the dynamic between them (specially after he told me he was not talking to her anymore and then I saw that they were still talking, his excuse was that he wanted to prove how him doing that didnt change anything between us and should not affect me ???). This time he cried and told me he loved me so much, he didnt want to be without me, and that he would cut contact with her. I told him okay and decided to give it another try.  It became a bit better but looking back we were just not compatible enough. He was extremely cheap, never wanted to plan/go on dates, but somehow expected me to be available to sleep with him all the time. We would fight again and it was ugly, a lot of yelling, ugly thing being sad, and a lot of frustration, very toxic. I always felt the need to fix things but he never wanted to talk and would even sleep when I would stay crying next to him. Then next day he would just pretend it never happened. Last year our fights became even more frequent and I felt him distancing. He would say he wanted to break up after every fight but I really wanted to try to fix it (big mistake). The more I tried the more he pushed away. One day he went on a business trip and stopped messaging me for the entire duration of it (2 weeks). At this point I was living fully in his apartment because I had to give up my student dorm. When he came back he told me his ex reached out to him and surprisingly she was in the same country as him. They met and slept together multiple times. Then she left and he got together with other girl he met there. He told me he didnt care about his ex and didnt want to get back together with her, just felt like doing it. And that doing that was the only option he had so I would finally leave. That same day he told me to leave, kicked me out basically, insulted me, and even hurt me physically. I was extremely traumatized after it and it was hard to cope with. I saw him once after that to pick up some things i left at his apartment but that was it. We had contact 2 or 3 times after the BU and always initiated by me. After everything I realised he had no empathy with others, emotionally closed off (the physical aspect was always more important than connecting emotionally), and was extremely manipulative (he kind of convinced me of doing things I didnt want to or wasnt sure, ex. moving in so early, sleeping with him super soon when I didnt feel ready, among other things), and always tried to make me bad guy because I was insecure and crazy. I always wondered how he always wanted to reach out to her but he left me like that and never looked back. Almost a year later, I still wonder and question everything. If it was real, if he ever cared, if i wasted my time and love with someone who didnt love me. He didnt have many friends or hobbies, so he would always make it seem like I was everything to him, always wanting to spend time with me. I did feel like I was that girl for him because I know he made efforts with me that he had not made with his previous girlfriends, but I really dont know. The way it ended made me feel it was all a lie and i hate to think I spent two years of my life with someone who was not over his ex. I know she was somewhat always available to him (and to have a casual encounters  every once in a while I guess - because she doesnt even live in the same continent as us) and I never stayed quite about the things I wanted and needed, which made me a problem and difficult to deal with.  I really struggle trying to cope with these thoughts. I do get sad sometimes and I hate that I still think of him a year later when he probably doesnt care at all.

Silvia V6,"As the title says, I recently noticed a **small leak from my steam wand** shortly after turning on the machine. Over time, the **valve also started feeling a bit ""dry""** when opening and closing.

I rarely backflush, so my drip tray usually stays pretty empty, but the other day, I cleaned it and noticed it was almost overflowing—super unusual. Since then, I checked after brewing and found **about 5-10ml of clear water in the tray right after pulling a shot**, which never happened before.

Lately, my steam pressure has also dropped, or rather drops too quickly. I installed a year ago a 3-hole steam tip that used to froth milk in 6-9 seconds, but **for the past 2 weeks, the milk doesn't spin as strongly**, and the boiler temperature drops way too fast. I already cleaned the steam tip, and there's no blockage (milk or limescale)

More context: 

* Machine is from 2021, used for 1-2 coffees since acquired.
* I only use bottled water
* Never descaled the machine. 
* No visible limescale buildup on the group head or inside the machine.
* No pressure drop when brewing—1:2 ratio in 30s is still spot on with my usual grind setting.
* PID installed, temperature is as per normal
* My workflow always ends with a cold water flush through the steam wand, and I bring the machine down to 100°C before turning it off.

I don’t see anything obviously wrong, so I assume it’s something with the steam valve system. But the fact that I’m also getting water in the tray confuses me—aren’t these separate systems?

So this is actual templete i used, i retrived from an old diary, i was remined of this by another post here and this a longer post that was part of my reply.

So When i was about 33 hivi & it was clear marriage was for me i decided to emabark on this mission to find the One!- First thing i did was stop the little clubing & drinking i did. I needed to be sober about this - Total focus! I created a List Must Haves & Nice To have, Also a checklist was necessary how do you get somewhere with a Map?

**Must Haves**  
  
✅She had to be Christian ( more points if she was Catholic)

✅No Children ( i love kids but no single Moms)

✅She had to be a ‘Nurturing ’ type this is hard to explain its like those females when visit them you they feed & feed you! The way I would test this we would walk into a restaurant date and i would order Tea or Coffee only a truly nurturing woman would share whatever she ordered with her Tea, infact this one(My wife) offered to share half of her food every time I would oder a drink only.

So there is one lady we went for a date a ordered a Cold Coke Zero, She ordered a Mango Juice ,Samosa & Sprig Rolls Platter and went ahead to eat every singlething without hata nudging me abit to have a taste! not even offering me a single samosa? *Jameni* Never called her after, Just got a text after many weeks *'kwani nilikosea wapi? Ulikosewapi. Ulikosewapi?*

✅ Another non negotiable was a certain tribe was off- they are great people but this was a wife we are talking about & i was dead set on not marrying from that region.( I would drop this today if i was dating as i  don't think hii is not very important anymore)

✅. Dresses conservatively.❌ No short skirts,❌ short  dresses just a woman who values her modesty. ❌No cleavage showing, slit dresser No ‘tights’ she can wear them indoors. ❌No showing off skin like thighs or boobs.

**Nice To Have**

☑️Dosen't Drink ( is was a must have which i moved to Nice to have)

☑️ Catholic - Christian  
☑️Loves fitness  
☑️Loves To Cook  
☑️Tall ( Tall for women is 5'7 to 5'9)  
☑️Slim/ Slimish or FIT

So imagine when i meet her a Church Event This Tall ☑️(5'8)☑️Catholic☑️FIT lady she immediately check a few nice to haves i  persued her relentelssy turns out she also had a Gym membership and loved to workout ☑️. She was also single and loved too cook! But what got me hooked was she was a true✅ Nurturer! 

Everytime i spent at her place all meals like buffets! She would cook & cook, i gained 10Kgs the fist year of dating her, we would cook, eat workout together, And she loved(still loves) Lifting weights✅✅ Now imagine a Gym bro who finds a Girl who lifts! We or I got many envious looks as we worked out together.

She was also in Maxi Dresses most of the time, Her wardrobe was only long skirts & Maxis dresses. *I had to wife her UP Man!* So hows life? i would say is 90-95% Good, some of things have changed like working out. People change but 85-90% of what i loved at first is still there.

It is not magic and it took me a while i also Prayed about this, we all have our faults her included but i got *Almost or most* of what i wished for

So Guys looking for long term partners or Wife feel free to use this templete- Adjust it to your tastes & needs! All The Best!",0,1743178053.0,Kenya,0,0.5,False

I joined this group the day I got discharged from the hospital and I was so amazed that there is a subreddit for gall bladder or the lack of. 😅 I have been reading through this subreddit while in recovery and some of your post op tips helped me a lot, thank you! So I thought I’d share my journey and I hope it helps someone. Lengthy post ahead. ✌🏼

I honestly thought my symptoms is just acid reflux. I have acid reflux and I’ve been to the ER before because of it. A few weeks prior to my surgery, I have been throwing up almost every other day whenever I eat. I really thought I was reacting to the food, coffee and also anxiety. 🥲 I have been taking Omeprazole and pain meds if it’s really bad and it goes away. Feb 16 (Sunday) I ran my 1st marathon! Everything went well, I finished strong. Feb 19 (Wednesday) I went back to work, and the whole day I have been experiencing stomach pain. I took Omeprazole in the morning, Sodium Alginate during lunch and afternoon, still no avail. I took pain meds at night and 2 hours have passed, nothing. I decided to take myself to the ER Thursday midnight.

At the ER, they did a battery of test for my blood, liver, pancreas and finally an abdominal ultrasound. Everything took 3 hours. Et voila: gall stones! I was admitted right then and there, doctor checked me and scheduled me for open Cholecystectomy on Saturday. I have 2 gall stones both are 1cm big and some sludge. I had to wait a day in the hospital for surgery. It’s my 1st time going through surgery, I was scared. 

Saturday, surgery day! My surgery took 2 hours and I was in recovery for 3 hours. My anesthesia was epidural. I was so worried I might feel the injection but I didn’t feel anything. I woke up though right when my surgery was finishing and it was a really weird sensation. I was also awake in the recovery room. I remember chatting up the nurses and we were talking about my tattoos. But everything was blurry and my words were slurry too. So weird. Surgery went well. My gall bladder was beyond salvageable. Doctor said it was really inflamed, thrice the size of how it should be. It was a good thing I got the surgery just in time because if not and it rupture, that’s a huge and different problem. 😳 My stitches were a little big, as the doctor had difficulty removing my swollen gall bladder, it’s 6cm (half a ruler) 🥲 I have the kind where the stitches are inside and the sutures are self dissolving. I also had a drain for a week sticking out on my side. Fun! 

Road to recovery: I got discharged the day after surgery but before that I needed to pee, fart and poop. I took antibiotics for 4 days, I was prescribed pain meds too but did not took any after discharge. I felt very loop a few days after being discharged. That was the most amount of meds I’ve had in my life. Pain was bearable, I walked around the house. No stairs for a week. No lifting of anything more than 1kg for a week. I took a shower a day after discharge, finally felt like a person! I’ve been eating mostly chicken, fish and a lot of vegetables. I was mostly asleep first few days post op. 

A week post op, my drain was removed. I was cleared to walk 15-20 mins a day, slow walking. I did my 1st walk and 30 mins I only managed 2kms. 😅 No pain, slowly introducing some foods. Had my 1st coffee in 3 months, I swear I could cry! 😭 I have been walking everyday since 1 week post op, getting stronger and better everyday. Doctor said I can run again and do yoga in 3 months. I can’t wait. ☺️ But for now, we take everything slowly but surely. Healing journey is a marathon, not a sprint. ❤️

TL:DR open cholecystectomy, surgery went well. No more pain, no more throwing up after eating.

My inclination was to go with the one still walkable to beach but closer to all other amenities, also to go with a house that has a pool, hot tub etc that we could enjoy when baby is sleeping or instead of slugging down to the beach for a second time that day.

But then someone said walking that far with a toddler is not as easy as it sounds- and that I’d have to carry her and wouldn’t be able to fit her in a wagon used for hauling all the other baby gear like tents, blankets, toys etc. which made me rethink a true beachside house (but with less to do- would require a car drive).

If you could choose which would you pick? I’m anticipating being alone at the house a lot which is another reason I am willing to splurge on something nice- I am desperate for a relaxing time and while I normally would be a beach bum for 6+ hours daily I don’t see that happening this time.

I’ve been watching Charlotte since 2023 and she’s one of my favorite YouTubers. I'm posting about a new friend I [32F] made recently that I'm starting to have mixed feelings about. We met through a certain friend-making app 🐝 and we got along well. We met up at a coffee shop and things went great. I wanted to arrange a second meetup and I started seeing red flags.

This is only the second time I'm meeting her in person, so I'm not completely comfortable sharing my whole life with her just yet. I have previous trauma from ex-friends who were very toxic and made me feel like I had to change myself for them, so I am trying to be more careful and also not over share things about my personal life. She asked if we could do a couples date since she already invited her boyfriend. My boyfriend was okay with it, but I do wish she asked me first. When I suggested restaurants to go to she said her and her boyfriend only do bars and breweries. We agreed on a place, but then she expressed interest in going to a different one. Now this is not a problem in itself, but I don't want to be in a position where I'm pressured to drink. I'm not a big drinker at all, I love a good sangria every once in awhile but I never cared for beer or… pretty much anything else that isn’t a sweet wine or a cocktail. And one of my ex-friends was a heavy beer drinker who constantly pressured me to drink and even once encouraged me to drink and drive - one of the many red flags that I ignored (don’t worry, I didn’t do it). When I told her my reasons for not wanting to drink a whole lot (I am on certain meds) she said that her sister is on the same meds and drinking is fine for her. I wasn't looking to party all night because we both work early, and plus I was having bad allergies all day. I passed because I was not feeling well and then I found out she had already called out for tomorrow so we could be out late. Did she expect me to do the same too? Keep in mind she just started this job a few weeks ago.

Like I said, I get along well with her, but I feel like she's expecting more out of me than I'm comfortable with at this point. Am I being unreasonable, or do you think I did the right thing not going? I just don’t want to get hurt again or feel like I have to change my personality for someone.

1jlycko,https://www.reddit.com/r/dad/comments/1jlycko/being_a_dad_at_22/,Being a dad at 22,"Okay, right, let me set the scene here. I’m 22, which means I’m legally an adult but emotionally still a 16-year-old with no clue what he’s doing. Got a job in programming, which is just a fancy way of saying I stare at a screen all day while my brain slowly decays. Do I make money? Yeah, I make enough. You know, for the essentials. Rent. Food. A few takeaways. You know how it is. I can buy some overpriced coffee from Starbucks without feeling like a fraud. Life's good, right?

But here’s the twist: I’ve got a kid. A 15-year-old kid. And before you ask, no, I didn’t plan this—because who plans to be a dad at 22? That’s something you do at, like, 30 when your hairline’s halfway to the back of your head and you’ve given up on dreams of ever being happy. No, this kid is technically my cousin, but now she's my adopted daughter. Because... plot twist.

Here’s the problem, though. I wake up some mornings, look in the mirror, and think, Do I even deserve this? Am I qualified to be a dad? I'm still using the same brand of shampoo I did when I was 15. Hell, half the time, I’m just sitting there, questioning life, wondering if I should’ve just stayed in my lane and not picked up the ‘dad’ role at such a young age.

I’m supposed to be this guiding force in her life. A mentor. A role model. But some days, I can barely even keep track of my own schedule. Like, I can’t even remember if I’ve brushed my teeth, let alone teach her life lessons.

And don't get me started on the age gap. I’m 22. She’s 15. That’s a gap big enough to feel like I’m trying to parent someone who’s still figuring out how to use Snapchat filters. Meanwhile, I’m just here, playing it by ear, pretending I know how to be a ‘good’ dad. My parenting advice consists of telling her to, like, ‘stay in school’ or ‘don’t do drugs,’ which, y’know, probably isn't terrible advice, but it’s definitely not groundbreaking.

Financially? Yeah, I’ve got the basics covered. I’m not rolling in cash, but I can manage. I’m living in Birmingham, which is a place with about as much personality as a piece of toast, but it’s home. But every now and then, I sit there and think, Am I really qualified to be a parent at 22? I mean, I can barely keep my plants alive. Shouldn’t I be a little more well-equipped for this whole ‘dad’ thing?

So, yeah. Am I a good dad? I don’t know. I just try not to mess up too badly. I guess that’s the bare minimum, right? Try not to completely screw them over. And maybe that’s enough. Maybe.",1,1743177352.0,dad,2,0.99,False

1jlyc6i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jlyc6i,140 miles in 7 days completed!,"Just wanted to update as I’d posted a couple of times about my 140 mile in 7 days walk for charity. I finished yesterday and have raised over £2300 and wanted to share a bit about my experience as prior to this, I thought a long walk was a 2 mile round trip to get a Greggs coffee so wanted to give confidence to anyone who deems themself a beginner to long distance walking.

- I used OS maps to plan the route (Manchester-Lincoln-Nottingham) - my advice would be to learn the topographic map as it shows boundaries (in my case fence lines) which was helpful for finding stiles as sometimes the actual route line wasn’t in the right place 

- I decided to go with Hoka Anacapa 2 lows after a fitting at Ellis Brigham - they are a size bigger than I normally wear and I had insoles, I also got a pair of merrells as a back up (which were helpful when I got blisters) I had been training in smart wool socks but these were far too warm by the time I got to the actual walk (typical March!) so I just switched to normal cotton and was fine (I got the blisters on the only day I wore the smart wool which was ironic!)

- speaking of blisters, I trained for around 4 months (I’d already been going to the gym for a couple of years consistently) and gradually increased my miles each week - I never ever got a blister and then for some reason on day 1 I got 2! I was beyond the help of compeed at this point and someone on here mentioned chiropody felt which I got the day before and this was a life saver! 

- company was a huge help, I was lucky that I had company on day 1, 2, 4 and then half of 5 and 7 so I only had to do a couple of days completely alone but days 3&4 were the hardest which is what a lot of people had told me - there were a lot of tears and doubt but I just had to keep putting one foot in front of the other! 

- K tape was an absolute life saver, I think I was quite lucky as I didn’t get any real issues with my joints but my calves became really sore by day 4 after 2 days of hills through the peaks and Sheffield so taping them helped relieve this as well as some foot stiffness!

Poles - just get them, they absolutely saved me on the hills and also useful for waggling at a bunch of very curious cows! 

I think they are the main things, I learnt a lot about myself and I’m thrilled I was able to do it and I’ve definitely got the bug now to do some Peak District walks if anyone has any recommendations!

1jlybxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/barrie/comments/1jlybxh/starbucks_customer_encounter_story_time_psa_at/,Starbucks Customer Encounter (Story time) PSA at end of story. Cheers!,"Today at the Starbucks I work at, we had one of those customers. A lady came through the drive-thru and mumbled her order so quietly we could barely hear her. We asked her (nicely) to repeat it, and instead of speaking up, she somehow managed to talk even quieter. We asked again, and that’s when she lost it — saying this was the ""worst experience she's ever had at a Starbucks"" and threatening to go to another store.

When she pulled up to the window, she went off about how our supervisor (who had been nothing but patient) gave her attitude — which was just flat-out false. Our supervisor stayed calm the whole time. The woman then said she'd be reporting us and felt the need to announce that she's a VP at a local bank, as if that somehow meant we should treat her better. After we apologized yet again, she scoffed, said ""I'm sure you are,"" and sped off.

But it didn’t end there. She later called our store to yell at our supervisor and spread lies that I mistreated her, laughed, and scoffed in her face — none of which ever happened. As someone who probably doesn’t have to stress about making ends meet as a ""big shot VP,"" it's honestly infuriating to see someone try to jeopardize the position and well-being of people in minimum wage jobs who likely rely on their paycheck far more than she ever will.

So here's a PSA for anyone who goes through a drive-thru: roll your window down all the way and speak clearly — not down at your phone, not toward your passenger seat, but directly at the speaker. It makes everyone's life easier.

And if you’re someone in a higher-paying job, please don’t act like that makes you special. At the end of the day, no one’s going to bow down to you just because you’re some big shot at a bank. You're ordering a coffee and a croissant — not curing cancer. Relax.

I am not attacking this individual, placing blame, or disregarding medical conditions. 

I truly don’t know what to do. This is a gentlemen who I have routine appointments with every month. I have seen him 5 times now. 

He is gaining weight. He reached 300 pounds today. All medical reasons for obesity have been ruled out by endocrinology. Luckily at my clinic people with obesity will see endocrinology first before the RD appointments so metabolic/medication, etc. can be ruled out. We focus primarily on nutrition, behavior change, physical activity. This man did was not eligible for any weight loss medications. No GLP-1 due to h/o medullary thyroid cancer on his mom’s side. No diabetes for even Ozempic/Mounjaro. No oral agents. 

This gentleman will tell me every appointment he doesn’t know why he is 300 pounds. 

Breakfast: 2 eggs, 2 sausage, black coffee
Lunch: 1 tuna sandwich, no mayo, no sides
Dinner: lean cuisine meal (380 calories, 17g protein) or a peanut butter & jelly sandwich
Drinks: water
Snacks: 1-2 oranges per day

We have discussed balancing his meals better but he doesn’t really take the advice. The only advice he has really latched onto is have 1-2 oranges per day. He doesn’t like to cook or put much effort into his meals. 

I try not to be an “advice giver” but he says “I don’t know” to almost everything asked. I’ll ask, “What are some things you’d like to work on?” and I provide several examples (more fruits/vegetables, a daily walk, adding lean protein, more water, mindful eating, etc. you get the picture) and he will always say, “I don’t know. But I really want to lose at least 40 pounds.”

I’ve asked about cravings, portion sizes, eating out, snacking and maybe forgetting about it. He denies it all. He has tried tracking before but only wants to write things down and averages maybe 1900 calories per day. Every day. 

Very sedentary with little to no movement. Ambivalent with this. Finds walking, indoor exercises, stretchbands all boring. 

I feel awkward during this appointments because I truly don’t know what to say and I feel embarrassment because I’m pretty much saying “I don’t know”. ",0,1743177065.0,dietetics,2,0.5,False

I really need some advice and to see if anyone has had similar experiences. I have been struggling with ibs for a long time now. It always manifested itself as diarrhea, and my poops were always soft, rarely did I have like really watery stool so not technically diarrhea but had the cramps. Often right after eating I would have diarrhea. This was happening for year. I also gave up coffee about 2 weeks ago and that’s when things changed. 
Now I am in incredibly constipated. Almost none of the diarrhea symptoms since cutting out coffee. So I went to a GI and she told me i have low motility and that paired with the coffee was causing me to have diarrhea. She told me to do a bowel cleanse which I did and it definitely cleared me out, but now, I’m still constipated and haven’t pooped in four days! 
I’m at a complete loss. With coffee I live with the constant threat of diarrhea, but have regular poops in the morning. Without coffee I can’t shit at all. PLEASE HELP PLEASE. 

I have started a dual probiotic and I’m also taking citrucel as well. I will see if that helps at all…I’m curious if anyone has tried the mushroom coffee and if that seems to help keep things regular without stirring up any issues for people. Please help I’m desperate.

- my xray showed I was basically full of poop 🙃 my doctor has been pretty vague about next steps, suggested a suppository, don’t know if I’m on board yet lol. Here are my symptoms of constipation:

- bloating and rumbling in my lower stomach
- not really any pain, which is so weird lol but more so discomfort and I can literally feel the heaviness in me. But when I go to try and use the bathroom, it’s like NOTHING is there
- I don’t think I have an obstruction, I pass gas every day and have very small minimal bowel movements usually daily (pebble or thin ribbon) 

Things I’m currently doing:
Morning Routine
- Pilates class
- 2 prunes
- ginger lemon hot tea empty stomach when I wake up
- heating pad
- probiotic yogurt with fiber granola and blueberries
- coffee
- I drink a tonnn of water

Night routine
- bone broth before dinner
- I’ll then eat a prune or kiwi again
- high fiber dinner with all whole foods (trying to finish all eating by like 8:30)
- dose of miralax 
- magnesium citrate capsule, senna capsule
- warm tea and heating pad
- bed by 10:30

1jlxyfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1jlxyfm/thanks_for_the_betrayal_trauma_i_still_love_you/,"Thanks for the betrayal trauma, I still love you","L***,

You broke everything between us. You were scared.  You can't even look at yourself.  You reside in self imposed shame. You threw me away and then had the audacity to tell me:

I ""treated you like gold"".
That I was magnanimous.
You said you thought we’d be lifelong partners as you ran away and didn't bother to fight for it for a god damned second.  You said ""I will miss you"" as if I wasn't right there holding on with everything that I had. 
Once early on you asked if I was only using you for sex, I didn't even know what to say to that. Still don't. You warned me that you didn't want to hurt me but you knew you would and did it anyway. 

And time after time I held you. I looked you in the eyes and told you the truth —
That I believed in you 
That I loved you.
And I meant it.
With every cell in my body.
Every beat of my heart.
Every breath I ever took in your presence.

And now?
Now I’m the ghost you pretend never existed.
I’m the silence you hide from.
I’m the one who gave you everything —
and was rewarded with betrayal so brutal, so reckless, so soul-violating
that I can hardly speak without shaking.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

You were loved.
Not used.
Not exploited.
Loved.  Not perfectly.  But the best that I could.  More than enough. 
Sacredly. Patiently. Fiercely.

And what did you do with it?

You burned it.
You pissed on it.
You violated it.
And then you walked away
like I was just another phase you had to outgrow
so you could go chase validation from manipulative strangers
and perform your self-destruction like it was some kind of personal and sexual liberation.  A delusion in search of mindless external validation.

You think that makes you free?
You think fucking a ""chad""  — a man with a mugshot and no soul —
makes you empowered and desirable?
You think letting his ""friends"" use you like a faceless body — with no past, no future, no heart, no soul, no meaning — makes you liberated, radiant,  and divine?

No.
It makes you lost.
It makes you hollow.
It makes you the exact thing you always claimed to be healing from.

You want to talk about vibration?
Your vibration is buried in shame and denial.
You preach your woo woo spirituality nonsense while ghosting the one person
who protected your heart like it was holy.  That's not spirituality.  That is delusion and denial.

Turns out you were right - we are spiritually incompatible. Just not in the way you think. I honor your spirit, even now, while you act as if I'm the devil incarnate.

I was there for you when no one else was. I showed up. 
When you were falling apart.
When you were parenting alone and struggling.
When you needed a place to feel seen and heard. I listened. I stayed. I dried your tears. I reassured you. I held your hand. I held you. 
I was home.
And you set that home on fire.

You discarded me and then confided in me about your health scare. Because even after everything, you still knew I was your safe harbor. 
And you knew I would hold you.
You knew I would comfort you.
You knew I would respond with love —
even as you were shoving your phone between your legs
to send pictures to a man who didn’t give a single fuck about you other than the opportunity to as he said ""cum in your pussy"".

That wasn’t confusion.
That wasn’t trauma.
That was calculated.
That was cowardice.
That was the kind of spiritual and emotional betrayal
you don’t walk away from unscarred.

You violated me.
You violated my trust.
You violated my soul.
You violated the sacred bond we built with care and honesty and intention.
You took our intimacy —
our laughter, our music, our family, our passion, our memories of joy and connection, our fucking future —
and used it like a stepping stone toward oblivion.

You’re not loyal.
Just because you didn’t cheat technically doesn’t mean you weren’t unfaithful in every other way.
You betrayed my vulnerability.
You destroyed my dignity.
You shit on every promise, every moment, every memory —
and still had the nerve to say you loved me.

Fuck you.

You screamed at me mercilessly to get the fuck out and shoved me when I confronted you and told you I knew what you were doing —
and I didn’t fight back.
I should have screamed.
I should have unleashed every word I’m saying now and more.
But instead, I stayed calm.
Because I loved you.
Because I respected you.
Because I couldn’t bear to see you hurt,
even while you were gutting me.

And that’s the sickest part —
Even now, after all the destruction,
I still want to protect you.
I still care.
I still have hope you’re okay.  That you're safe and protected. That you have nutritious food to eat and somehow a home cooked meal even though you'd never do that yourself. That you have coffee exactly the way you like it. Money for lunch. Your bills are covered. Someone to look after, care for, and engage your son with patience, respect, and love. Walk and feed our dog.  Drive you home when you've had too much to drink.  Or just drive you around safely near or far.

I still worry about your pain.
Even though you’d never survive the pain you left me with.
If you felt a fraction of what I carry every day,
you’d likely collapse.

What the fuck is wrong with me?
Why do I still love you?

I think it’s because part of me is still loyal
to the version of you that never truly existed, only in moments and flashes, the person you pretended to be.
The version that held my face when we made love.
The version that said “I love you” countless times and looked like she meant it. The person that showed up when I experienced the loss of each of my parents. 
The version that promised me forever
and meant it in the moment.

But that version of you is dead and gone.
Or was never fully real.
And I’m the one left to find a way to say goodbye and bury her.
Alone.

With the echoes.
With the avoidance.
With the silence.
With the ghost of a future
that only I seem to remember or care about.

You didn’t just leave.
You disrespected me. 
You abandoned me.
You discarded me.
You humiliated me. 
You emotionally raped me.
And then you ran.
And left me to clean up the wreckage
of the most beautiful thing I ever believed in.

So no —
I don’t forgive you even though part of me desperately wants to.
Not now.
Maybe not ever.
Because forgiveness isn’t deserved.
It’s earned.
And you’ve done absolutely nothing to earn it.

And still — I love you.
And still — fuck you.
And still — I’m the one bleeding.
And you’re the one running.

But one thing’s for sure —
I survived you.  Barely.  I'm barely hanging on.  Summoning every bit of strength, resilience and fortitude that I have to carry on and keep my heart open.
If this love was a test of our souls - you failed completely. So I'll see you in the next life, for the next round of ""us"", and I sincerely hope you may have really learned something. That all of this was not in vain. That my love was not wasted. That my feelings mattered. That my soul — this loving, loyal soul — can finally be seen for the sacred way it gives.

I love you

Fuck you

My (F38) WH (M41) keeps pressuring me to reconcile and heal. I'd love to hear from others  to learn how long it took you to decide if you wanted to stay or go. If you stayed, was it a one-time decision to work it out? If you divorced, did you file right away or try to work on the marriage first? 

TLDR: Married over a decade with 1 young child -- but WH had a 3-5year emotional affair after a difficult marriage. There are no financial reasons to stay and my main motivation is our child. WH doesn't like how long it's taking me to possibly reconcile. I feel like I'm being gracious for taking things slow instead of just separating and divorcing.

The background and introduction:

This throwaway account is fairly new so that I can actually engage with content. With my main I've been lurking on this and similar subs for years. 

So it's about time for an anonymous introduction and backstory. Then my future participation will have some context. 

I (BW) want a divorce from my wayward husband (WH). We’ve been married for over a decade and have 1 young child. 

Since attraction is always a part of this I’m 5’5” and always weighed between 135-165lbs (pregnancy). My typical measurements are 40” bust, 29” waist, 41 hips/bum so, kind of curvy. I’ve always worked out regularly for mental health, to maintain my weight and give myself back support (my chest size plus desk jobs can make a strain). I’ve always had professional, office jobs so, I dress creative/business casual most of the time. I don’t wear much makeup (mascara and tinted lip balm) and I like to change my haircolor and cut frequently. People tend to perceive me as confident, intense, and intelligent with an artsy side. I’m passionate about my work and creative hobbies. My child is my number one priority.

Dating in College and After: I initially dismissed WH when he started pursuing me because I thought he was a player. He always seemed to have a roster of girls that he was flirting with. But, he chased me hard and we got along. I was attracted to him and he seemed to adore me. I figured I misread his personality when he was single. 

However, I started to have doubts as our relationship continued. We were young and I felt like I had no right to control his behavior.

 So, I kept things casual even when we were boyfriend/girlfriend. I’m independent and easygoing — not a clingy person. I had my own interests, friends, and traveled a lot. So, I figured we fit well together. However, there were a few points of drama that I didn’t appreciate.

- Girls often thought they were dating him even while we were boyfriend/girlfriend. One of the girls on my dorm even slept in his hoodie. He said this was a misunderstanding and she stole it.

-WH watched a show at his ex’s apartment every week. He did bring me one time but she was rude to me and touchy with him. I later found out that my toxic, assigned roomates were besties with her and would snoop and report on our relationship. Eventually, the weekly show became just the two of them in pjs. He told me later that he stopped going. When I asked him why, he said she kissed him or tried to kiss him — that’s still unclear 20 years later. I was never satisfied with that answer or how I had to drag it out of him.

- For about 6 months midway through of our relationship, we were long distance. I would see social media images of him canoodling women -- like women sitting on his lap or him laying his head on their breasts. Whenever I asked about it, he said they were just friends. When we were living near again, I met some of the girls and they didn’t believe we were actually together. A few of them were hostile to me which WH ignored. 

- His family and friends encouraged him to dump me because I wasn’t part of their circle.

- We both lived in his hometown post college. We weren’t living together and both had our own jobs, as boyfriend/girlfriend. He never defended me and would often criticize me.

- I was very unsure about moving the relationship further because of some of his other issues (employment, mental health, school debt, family issues). But, WH kept pushing for us to get married. When he proposed I said yes. Not long after our engagement, I found some financial and family lies that made me almost break up. However, I decided I loved him enough to help him through it.

Newlyweds: The beginning of our marriage was one of the worst times of my life. I realized I married someone less mature. We fought constantly. I worked long hours and was trying to pull us out of his debt. WH struggled to work consistently, often gave family and friends money, racked up credit card debt, and didn’t help at all with errands and chores. It felt like I had adopted a needy child — not married a husband. 

He often came back from spending time with friends, including flirty, clubbing girls, smelling of alcohol and cigars. He kept reconnecting with women from highschool that he described as “hot”, “troubled”, or “slutty” — usually all 3.  

He would often lie about where he was or what he was doing even though it was things I didn’t care about or seemed really unimportant -- just conversational. I was busy so, I wasn’t keeping tabs on him. I would get confused by his stories and why he would hide benign details.

He would criticize me and complain that we had no money or fun. I became burnt out and needed an easier job in a more affordable town. I found one and said we really needed to restart. My motivations were mainly financial because I was struggling to sustain us. But, I also wanted to get away from his toxic relationships.

Our sex life was odd during this time. We were both virgins when we got married but, he seemed to have a lot of shame or hangups. I thought it would be fun to explore positions and activities together. He would close his eyes the whole time we were intimate and go quickly. He wouldn’t pleasure me so, I learned to take care of myself while we were together. He always said it was amazing and he always finished.

2012-2014: We moved to a lower cost of living area where neither of us had many connections. I had a job that required me to work long hours and travel. I was able to start slicing away at our debt. He got a night shift job. Since we saw each other infrequently, we got along pretty well. I felt like we were starting to make things work as a couple. He was often unhappy and complained about our life.

I would plan lots of fun things for him, get him gifts, and try to help him see a hopeful future. I told him I would support him in his education goals.

He described his dream job and I said I would do everything in my power to make that happen. It was hard because I had to pay for him to repeat many classes from his bachelor’s degree just so he could raise his GPA for grad school. But, I would do anything to make him happy. To my knowledge, he didn’t stray during this time.

Our sex life was infrequent and I often asked him how much he wanted sex. He would say 3ish times a week. I wanted more but, figured maybe I was higher libido and he was low libido. While we had sex he would go within a few seconds and always closed his eyes. It felt very disconnected and disappointing. I read a lot of articles about getting what you want out of sex and taking responsibility for your own orgasm. He always said it was amazing and he always finished.

2015-2018: WH lost his part time job through his own negligence. I found a new job at his preferred college so I could get him education benefits. I hated that job passionately. It was stressful and required long hours. But, I was willing to do it for him. All he had to do was take classes. I hoped he would help around the house since he was only taking classes part time and not working. Instead, he did no chores and would complain about helping with errands or tasks. He also started spending with the credit cards again. He seemed so unhappy even though I was doing everything I could do help him reach his dreams. That’s when I discovered he was watching porn all day instead of doing his classes. He believes porn is a sin. He said he used to look at it as a teen and then stopped. I knew this before we were married but, he made it sound like a young kid’s curiosity not an addiction. 

Also around this time, our sex life was odd. He rejected me often. He would reject positions or just reject sex altogether. I started putting it together that he had nothing left for me so, he avoided intimacy. I became more sexually frustrated and wished we would do it more frequently. I would talk about it directly but, he wouldn’t answer me. I would ask him how often he liked to have sex and he would say a few times a week. I would ask him if he wanted to try anything new or do anything different and he would turn me down.

After my discovery of his porn use, I told him I would help him. We installed protection software of every device. I took every action he asked to help protect him from it and avoid triggers.    

I didn’t withhold sex after this for punishment or anything. We actually had sex that night and I told him I forgave him the lies and would help him. 

But, things stayed weird. He kept turning me down for sex even though I knew he couldn’t access porn. Because he failed his classes and didn’t seem to do well with all that free time, we decided scaling back school and getting a job would give him some structure. 

Following this, he seemed a little happier. However, there were uncomfortable interactions with his new coworkers, such as:

- I heard about a flirty woman that he worked with through a male coworker of his. WH seemed to be attracted to her and spend time with her at work. I brushed it off as jealousy on my part. Then, one day I was near his work during a break and thought I’d visit. I saw him and this woman standing by a side door chatting very closely. From the other side of the parking lot, I even watched him gaze at her as she walked away to her car. I never told him what I saw and abandoned my plan to visit him. I think their flirtation lasted several months but, I don’t know how far it went.

- Another woman coworker kept stopping by a place where I worked and saying hi. She would remind me that she knew my husband and would say odd things about how close of friends they were. She considered herself his work wife. WH did mention at one point that it got uncomfortable having a desk near her. WH’s supervisor, a cool lady, actually told me she did me a favor and moved their desks apart. I never knew what to make of that because he denied it. I think this lasted about a year, possibly more.

- He would go through spells of being mean to me. He would criticize me and be unpleasant at home. Sometimes, he would tell little stories about coworkers but, wouldn’t use names or pronouns. I started to catch on that he would get crushes on people at work and start flirting with them. Eventually things would cycle to where he wasn’t interested or the girl backed off (assume because he was married). 

I always brushed this off as my own jealousy and insecurity. I didn’t want to be a clingy, naggy, controlling wife. I was just direct saying “who’s that?” or “how do you know them?” So, whenever he said someone was just a friend, I let it go. I actually put a lot of effort into sorting out my “jealousy” issues and being even more laid back. He made me feel like I was nuts and misinterpreting all of his relationships with women.

Still we were fighting about a lot of things with his family and finances. WH was kind of a mess mentally and with his work and school. I loved him and felt sorry for him. I really wanted to help him. But, he lied about the craziest non-important things.

He wanted more job training that required him to go away for 3 months. I encouraged him to do it but we were definitely in a bad place at the time. 

2018: I spent that time apart feeling so happy and free. I fantasized about divorcing him and having a happier life. He didn’t seem to care about me or appreciate me. And he was making us both miserable. 

But as we re-connected over the phone, he really seemed to be working through his issues. He had a sense of self and purpose. He got some counseling and really improved. He would talk about things that made it sound like he was maturing. I thought maybe he was using the time apart to be a better man.

I visited him for a few days (long drive) and couldn’t believe how much he had changed. He seemed much like the man  I fell in love with. We had unprotected, birth-control-free sex for the first time ever. He asked if I was sure and I said I loved him and wanted us to really be a family together. He was so happy and excited.

Shockingly, I got pregnant during that visit and started my difficult pregnancy (in my 30s and over 10 years into our marriage) alone. 

When he returned, he was more devoted than he’d ever been. He wasn’t particularly helpful or responsible but, he was kind. He started doing better at work and school. It seemed like the baby somehow was motivating him to grow up. (That wasn’t my intention but, I was happy to see it).

I felt like we were starting something new. I started my own business as the next step in my career and aggressively planned for our future — where I could still support him and take care of our child with the flexibility. He loved this plan and seemed really happy. 

We had lots of pregnancy sex and I gained about 20 lbs overall. I could still fit into most of my clothes and pants (minus the top button). I worked out my whole pregnancy. I actually fit back into my wedding dress by the time my son was 3 months old.

2019: After a difficult pregancy and life-threatening, complicated labor, I had our child and things got really hard. WH started traveling frequently for work training and I tried to recover. He never saw me struggle postpartum or getting my body back because he was gone for those months. When he returned, I was back to my pre baby weight but fitter. I do have stretch marks on my belly. I was actually too tight at first from stitches and all the kegels for continence. He never had to deal with a fat, hormonal postpartum wife. Baby was already moved to the nursery with me getting up for nighttime feedings and I was wearing my pre-pregnancy clothes. 

I was disappointed at how disinterested he was in helping me with our baby. We both worked FT but I did all the childcare and chores. The criticizing started up again. I felt like I couldn't survive it for long. I vowed that this was my last child and got an IUD. When a company reached out to me for flex work I took it and paused my biz temporarily. Partially for the security of a paycheck and partially because WH was pressuring me to keep his standard of living the same. 

2020: When Covid hit, everyone's world was rocked. WH got depressed and irritable. I kept pushing him to see a counselor again. 

Our sex life stayed about the same although I was still frustrated. I wanted more frequency and more connection but he rejected me. 
I was stressed balancing a toddler, daycare, nannies, chores and work. He was irritable but never followed through on any of his responsibilities. I actually started hiring things out like mowing because I couldn't do it all. 
Then I got ill with Lymes/alpha gal. It rocked my health. But I got treatment, stuck to a strict diet and exercised religiously to keep mobility. 
WH scolded me for getting sick and said it was my fault for working too much and being too stressed. 

What I didn't know at the time was that AP got hired at his job. They didn't work together but apparently he could see her from his desk. 
He actually lied to me when this all came out and said they met in 2022. But I have since confirmed that she added him on Facebook in 2020. He had disconnected from me on social media previously so I didn't know or care much about what he was up to on there. 

2021: We bought a house together and I thought it will finally make WH happy. He loves the house and we buy him a new car too. He says he never thought his life could be this good. Things are very confusing to me when I look back on this time. There were a lot of high points and goals hit. Things finally seemed normal and nice. WH tells me he was depressed and numb -- that he hated his life. He started working directly with AP but they were both remote because of Covid. 
I had no suspicions. 

We were having sex regularly if less frequently than I wanted and my health had returned. I was actually feeling quite hot because all the exercise to recover made me lean and muscular. WH often rejected me or acted disinterested. 

What I didn't know is that he started watching porn again. Sometime over the years devices changed and he never added the protection softwares back on. 

He told me later he was triggered by vids on social media. Indeed, I've stopped through his activity history and it is wretched. Basically just all Only Fans content and some of his Facebook friends who post thirst traps. I had no idea at the time. 

But he started all the weird lying again about stuff that seemed weird to lie about. It was all benign things. Now he tells me he was lying to cloud how much time he was spending with porn and interacting with risqué content. 

He was also critical of me – making me work harder to please him. I thought he had depression and pushed him to see a counselor. He went to a few sessions then dropped it. I encouraged him to return to the office.  He had stopped showering and exercising and seemed distracted.  I thought a routine and getting out of the house would help his mental health. Also I wanted some space from him yelling at me. 

Whenever he traveled for work I would dread his return. Most of it was his attitude. Part of it was the amount of extra chores that came from him. More cooking, more cleaning, more picking up, more laundry has to happen when he's here. It's exhausting.

His return to office seemed to have a positive effect on his mind.

2022: AP returned to the office as well. Until this point, I wasn't really aware of her. They just talked with blacked screens when we all WFH. In person, he says she started flirting with him. He said he became more attracted to her especially when she expressed interest in him. She 100% knew he was married with a child. 

He said they started eating lunch together daily and having 1:1 meetings during work. They also started texting constantly even when he was home. 

He tells me now that she started changing the way she dressed. She looks so different from me. She's almost as tall as him 6', pear shaped, and flat chested. She dresses kind of glam with a full face of makeup every day, hair blown out, acrylic nails, lots of jewelry and heels. He said she went from wearing tops and jeans to sundresses and miniskirts. 

He would check out her legs. When they talked she would hitch up her skirts to give him a peek while she faced him in her desk chair. 

He talks about it now with such a happy fog.
I was going to the gym consistently and aggressively during this time. I remember feeling awefuk about myself because of WH’s new relationship and questioning if I was attractive. But I actually even got asked out during this time by two different men. (I guess men just shoot their shot.)

At the time, he raved about her professionally. I joked at first that he had a crush on her -- before i had any suspicions. He declared she was the prettiest girl in the office and the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. It stung. 

He assigned her all sorts of positive attributes like that she was kind, caring, hard worker, etc. 
It also sounded like she made a lot of drama for his office. 

She dated several coworkers and it caused issues. She had fallings out with coworkers and couldn't get along with customers. Every day it sounded like he had to save her from her job duties. For someone so amazing, she needed a lot of support and attention – on and off the clock. 

I figured I would wait it out and see what happened. Then AP pushed WH to do a work party. It was supposed to be at her house. Then work. Somehow she convinced him to move it to our house. 

I was pissed because it was a busy time of year for me. WH dumped all the cleaning and prep on me the day before the event.

When AP arrived, I figured out why I had an uneasy feeling. She gave him a full frontal hug and wrapped her arms around his lower waist. She moved his hands around her waist and tucked her head under his chin. 

All this after deliberately setting down her food tray. 

I was shocked and knew it was an affair. 
She came into my kitchen and fussed that I didn't set things up the way she wanted. She started opening drawers and cabinets looking for stuff. She also started gushing about her relationship with my husband – how close they were, how she's never felt like this before with anyone, how special their connection is. 
I just blew her off and left the kitchen.

The whole party she flirted with another coworker stealing glances at my husband.

She was wearing a low cut top, heels, and a shirt skirt and kept leaning toward him or pulling up her skirt higher while sitting.  
Everyone else wore jeans or sweats. 

She also took opportunities to touch his arm and thigh. 

Before she left she cornered me again in the kitchen. She asked if I had been bothered by what she said and her special friendship with my husband. I dismissed her again and played it off. 

She gave WH a big, long hug before she left. 

After the party ended, my husband and I had our first fight about her. I started carefully by saying she seemed like a lot and kind of drama. He defended her saying she was sweet and I could learn to be like her. 

I questioned his feelings for her. He denied them. I told him I felt she had a crush on him. He denied it.

 I asked him to change their interactions out of respect for our relationship. He refused.

I was astounded. We'd always said we would respect those kind of requests from our spouse. I'd never asked that before despite my discomfort in the past. The one time I really said to please stop, he said no. 

2023: AP started dating one of her subordinates. Because of the conflict and drama, someone had to move. WH fought to keep her working close with him. He would actually tell me parts of this thinking he was being sneaky about who was causing the issue. 

Now, he admits that he and her were emotionally bonded and he admitted it ti himself when he fought to keep her close at work. Not only were they flirting and lusting, they talked about intimate topics like childhoods, relationships, life stress, and aspirations. 

Her boyfriend was moved and they broke up shortly after. 

Around this time I tried to connect with WH more. I arranged my schedule so we would have a weekly lunch date. He came once and was so happy. 

He tells me now he went to work glowing. But AP was pissed. He said he subconsciously didn't want to go with me because she wouldn't give him attention whenever he was happy with me. 

Mostly she acted like I didn't exist and he says he did too. But when I did something for him or made him smile at work, she reacted poorly and would freeze him out. 

He stood me up every other time I planned a lunch. He says he would watch porn and lose track of time. Then not have time to meet me. Plus it made AP happy that he didn't. 

WH kept talking about her at home but stopped using her name. 

I started finding purchases for gifts, mostly snacks and coffee. Sometimes I would see the gifts and he would play it off as something nice to say thank you for helping. But I knew they were all for her. 

He's now confirmed this and said he reason was mostly to get time and attention from her.
 
AP benefitted at work from their relationship. He helped her get interviews for different positions and promotions. He also supported her ideas and covered her mistakes. This is so gross to me as a feminist. 

Also I don't think they were nearly as sly about their relationship as they think they were.

I saw constant texts and she called him a lot. I never snooped through his devices or accounts because it was so obvious. I did check our phone bill for a work reason once and was disheartened by the amount of communication.

I was frustrated because he kept working weekends to be with her or to cover for her. He literally took time away from our child for her needs. 

Later I did look through phone records more specifically. There are a lot of messages when he traveled for work, often with image attachments. He insists he never sexted but, I don't believe that.

Also during those trips he said he didn't have cell service or was busy. So he wouldn't say goodnight to our child but he could text or call her.

By that summer I was done with him. I started stockpiling cash and ramping up my business. I wanted to be in a strong place going into a divorce. 

During this time, I realized he was watching a lot of porn. I confronted him and showed him proof but he denied it. It was kind of insane. 

Our sex life was still the same but I was so frustrated. I felt like I was on a hamster wheel. I would work out to burn off energy but that only built up my libido more. I would see men at the gym check me out and sometimes they would talk to me. I just wanted to scream, “...my husband turns me down for sex and is cheating on me”. 

In the fall, I had one final confrontation with WH. I told him he needed to end it (whatever it was) with AP. He denied there was anything going on. 

I told him that I had found some online evidence of her looking at my work websites and social profiles (she was in my sales funnel) and to please make it stop. He denied everything and said there was nothing to change. 

So I decided I would leave him. Unfortunately, my kid then I got a flu right after that. It was a bad one and I struggled to recover from it.  I begged WH to help take care of our child but he just isolated himself and wouldn't help. 

I kept getting sicker. 

It ended with me being hospitalized for a burst appendix and a lot of related complications. It was bad enough that the surgeon didn't make any promises and told us to say goodbye to each other. I went under for surgery furious that I would die without saying goodbye to my child.  

Obviously I made it through. But months of recovery and tests and pain and surgeries confirmed that all the stress has created an underlying chronic condition. I'll never eat normally again and still have occasional pain.

2024: I remember thinking that WH almost killed me. I vowed not to let him do that. I focused on healing, keeping my business, and getting strong. 

After the hospital, he started changing. At first he had to help with our child and chores because I couldn't. But he kept doing them after I recovered. 

He gave me a lot of attention and was being romantic. He seemed like he was in love with me and afraid of losing me. 

I felt conflicted. He was finally acting how I always wanted – a good partner. 

But I also didn't feel bad only staying with him for his health insurance and support while I got healthy again. It took until fall for me to start feeling normal. 

What he's told me now is that my medical crisis snapped him out of it. He cried while I was in surgery. He realized how much he loved me and how poorly he's treated me. He also decided to cut off AP. 

When we went back to work, she made a joke about my situation. This infuriated him. He started to see what kind of person she really is. 

He stopped talking to her, helping her and replying to her texts. She pushed harder by creating reasons she needed his help or talking to him about personal issues.

In the spring, her family encouraged her to connect long distance with a family friend and they started “talking”. 

AP asked WH if she should date the friend and my husband blew her off. 

He just wanted her gone so when she asked him to give a reference for a new job he gave a glowing one and she left. It was such BS because he didn't supervise her -- they were peers.

She kept showing up at his work after that trying to meet either mutual friends and him for lunch or visits. But he said he always bailed. She kept texting him and going into their old work chats even though she didn't work there anymore. 

He was still watching porn this whole time but trying to stop. 

AP got engaged to the family friend. She told my husband she didn't love her fiance but fiance always was in love with her. He could provide for her and she wanted to be married.

WH said that conversation freaked him out.

 AP and him has never defined things between them. He felt like the relationship was innappropriate but never crossed his mind that it was an affair. He saw it as flirting with a deep friendship that maybe went too far. 
And she dated other people during that time so he wasn't sure what to think. 

I've since told him it was a way to get him jealous and make drama. Now that I've seen some of their work chats, she kept trying to get him to define things. They both talked about “we” and “us” creating themselves as a little unit. All texts and Dms are deleted though.

Regardless he felt like he out the whole thing behind him by the end of the year. As WH tells it, he felt like if he fixed our relationship, and tied up loose ends, he could keep me. 

2025: At the beginning of the year, we were playfully looking at something on his phone. I accidentally stumbled across some of his porn. He denied it while the evidence was literally 3 inches from us. 

After a fight he confessed that he had been caught up in in since 2021 and obviously he knew I knew. 

He agreed to get a counselor and installed blocking software on his phone right then. He wanted to delete his social profiles but I convinced him to wait and just let me change his passwords.

His confession was such a relief and I knew this was my chance. The next morning I decided to seduce the truth out of him. I've never weaponized sex before but basically I did. I got him to confess that he had an innappropriate relationship with AP. He won't call it an emotional affair.

The truth kept trickling out over days and weeks and is still trickling out. 

We're in couples counseling and I agreed to do that for a certain amount of weeks. He's in indivual therapy too.

I've left out some details but, what he confessed was worse than what I knew. But it's not as bad as I imagined. I've gotten STD tests a few times during this situation and he insists it never got physical. But he never came clean on his own, some of the story doesn't fit together, and I still think he's lying about some things. 

I've been in a waiting mode, trying to get the truth and decide what I want to do next. WH is mostly upset that I won't promise to stay and work on healing our relationship. 

Based on your experiences, how long would you sit on the fence trying to decide whether to leave him or stay?

You didn’t sleep well because your second job kept you out late or your mind was spinning about bills or rent or whether your car will survive another month, your headache is preventing you from knowing which. You chug some coffee, maybe skip breakfast, and get ready for a job that barely covers your expenses. If you’re lucky, you have health insurance but it comes with a $4,000 deductible you can’t afford to use.

You drive to work on roads full of potholes, past homeless encampments, wondering if that could be you in a few years. You spend 8–10 hours doing work that’s either mind-numbing or physically draining. Your boss calls it “family,” but they’d fire you over a spreadsheet. Lunch is whatever you could throw together—fast food, maybe leftovers—eaten in 15 minutes before getting back on the clock.

After work, you might head to your second job, or home to take care of kids, parents, or both. You don’t have time to relax. You don’t have energy to cook. Groceries are expensive. Everything is expensive. And god help you if you get sick, get a flat tire, or need dental work. You check your bank account: two digits. Maybe three.

Your rent just went up. Again. But your wages didn’t. You can’t afford to buy a house, and even if you could, the mortgage rates are absurd. You’re not saving for retirement. You’re just trying to survive until next month. Maybe you take a weekend off once a year. Maybe. But mostly, you grind. Because if you stop for even a second, everything falls apart.

The news tells you inflation is under control. The job market is great. The economy is booming. But it never trickles down. All you see are billionaires getting richer, politicians getting donations, and corporations laying off workers to please shareholders. You’re told to work harder, learn to code, drink less coffee, be grateful.

This is the life most Americans live in some form. I’m sure most of you have faced some of these struggles. know the truth:

The system isn’t broken. It’s working exactly as intended. And it’s grinding people like you into dust to keep the machine running.

Most people have never heard of BlackRock, Vanguard, or State Street, but these three financial giants quietly own huge chunks of the entire economy.

These three firms control $25+ trillion combined and hold major stakes in nearly every industry: tech, oil, housing, weapons, food, and healthcare. If it’s in the S&P 500, they probably own a piece of it—and usually a big one. Their money fuels mass incarceration, deportation centers, and climate destruction, all while hiding behind 401(k)s, pensions, and public funds.

They’re not just investors. They’re kingmakers. They vote in boardrooms, shape corporate policies, and influence national economic trends while pretending to be invisible. They quietly profit while we suffer.

Here’s how we hit them where it hurts:

Pull the Plug on Their Funding
• Demand states, cities, and universities divest from these firms—especially from prison and fossil fuel investments.

• Target public pension funds (like CALPERS or state teacher retirement systems).

• Pressure labor unions to move their money elsewhere.

Every dollar pulled weakens their grip.

Expose the Monopoly
• These firms own stakes in competing corporations—which kills real competition and inflates prices.

• Demand antitrust action and bans on cross-ownership in key industries (energy, healthcare, housing, food).

• Push for full ownership transparency.

Shine a light on their monopoly—and break it.

Take Back Our Retirement
• Most people are tied to these firms through 401(k)s or IRAs without consent.

• Fight for public or union-run retirement options.

• Demand control over our own shareholder votes—not theirs.

Our savings shouldn’t bankroll oppression.

Tax the Empire
• Support a Financial Transaction Tax to make speculation expensive.

• Tax unrealized gains on mega-firms hoarding wealth.

• Penalize investments in prisons, ICE contractors, fossil fuels, and surveillance tech.

If they profit off misery then they should pay for it.

Build Alternatives
• Invest in worker-owned co-ops, credit unions, and public banks.

• Create state- and city-run investment firms that serve people, not Wall Street.

• Launch postal banking and public financial tools for communities.

Starve the beast, build the future.

Boycott, Disrupt, Expose
• Organize boycotts of companies backed by BlackRock and Vanguard (start with GEO Group, CoreCivic, ICE contractors).

• Build viral campaigns: “Break BlackRock” “Divest from Death” “No Prisons in Our Portfolios”

• Use shareholder protests and digital pressure to force their hand.

Name them. Shame them. Strip their power.

Use State Power
• Pass state laws banning investment in human rights abusers.

• Force contract transparency for firms doing business with public agencies.

• Push ballot initiatives to redirect public funds to ethical investments.

Congress may be slow but the states can move now.

The Bottom Line:

BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street run on secrecy, complexity, and our money. If we cut off their public funding, expose their monopoly, and build new systems, we don’t just weaken them. We build a future that works for people, not profit.

Let’s mobilize. Let’s divest. Let’s disrupt.

# Perfidious: Wine Poached Pears - An elegant scent to soften the edges and ease communication. Delicate d’Anjou pears simmered in a subtly spiced rosé.

Oh this is absolutely mouthwateringly delicious. I'm deeply in love with NCD's pear notes as they really capture the ripe gorgeousness of D'Anjou pears because of how syrupy sweet they are. I adore the opening, it's really just honeyed slices of pear, with soft mulled and spiced pear. I don't quite get any rose from this, but the soft simmering spices of the mulling spices here give a thorough haze of warmth to the scent, leaning into a mulled apple cider type scent. On me, this scent slowly shifts on my skin as more of an apple pie note after the pear note fades, but on my co-tester, this one ends up being far more fruity and almost pineapple/apricot adjacent type scent - it's almost tropical and sour at points, compared to my tendencies to amp sugar. That said, this scent reminds me a lot of my all time favorite NCD scent, Mourning Dove, but in a more maple heavy gourmand package, and it's really a lovely treat. This is also a comparatively heady and intense blend, just a drop of this lasts hours, and my co-tester was smelling pear for hours even with just the lightest dab. 

# Swindle: Frosted Lemon Cake - A simple confection to restore balance. Tangy-sweet lemon pound cake with vanilla royal icing.

Having loved Poppycock, the most perfect rendition of a lemon meringue pie, I was a little apprehensive this potentially being a very similar scent, but I was pleasantly surprised by how different this is. Much like Poppycock, the lemon here is extremely saccharine, it's only ever so slightly tart, like lemon cream and sugar, it's soft and pastel yellow, but cheery and bright. While I do wish this was a little more zesty, it's a perfect shade of lemon to match with this gorgeous yellow cake scent - it smells freshly baked and deliciously indulgent, with a distinctly caramel like quality like the crunchy sugary edges of baked goods, and the faintest whiff of maple syrup. I haven't quite tried a cake accord like this, and it's very similar to the cupcake note in Phenakism, but it's very true to life and extremely hyperrealistic, and I really adore this combination of lemon icing and rich yellow cake. For me, this actually reminds me a lot of Bongo Poppy Cake (MooScents), with the same complex richness in its baked goods note, but what it lacks in the lemon, it makes up in the caramelized sugar - BPC is one of my all time Moona favorites in any case, and I'm happy to see Swindle join its ranks whenever I'm craving something slightly less loud. This might not be most people's idea of a sleepy time scent, but it's definitely mine. 

# Phenakism: Faerie Cakes - A whimsical olfaction to honor Spring’s return. Tiny cupcakes conjured from lavender-infused sugar, maple sap gathered at the Vernal Equinox, fine almond flour, oatmilk, and rainbow sprinkles.

I'm in love with this one - the opening of this is magical, like the warmth of freshly baked yellow cupcakes and a smear of creamy vanilla icing, and a giant jug of maple syrup. Although the scent has nuances of light herbal lavender just creeping around the edges, and an almost sharp amaretto leaning almond, these fade quite quickly in the presence of the golden maple syrup. For me, the maple is the heaviest note in this blend, but I find that NCD always does a gorgeous maple - although this one is even more sticky and richer than their usual wares. The only note I have on this is that although I usually don't have a huge issue with NCD's almond accord (almond usually is a bit of a death note for me), I find this one ever so slightly sharp and a little too biting for my taste, but it's quickly tempered by the heavy maple and the yellow cake. I'm almost reminded of sweeter take on Pumpkin Craves Bread (Arcana) with this scent, especially with the heady maple candies and the scent of sweet baked goods - it's an unexpected favorite from the collection but I'm besotted with this one. I found this one very linear in wear after dry down, but this one had an impressive throw and wear time compared to some of the other NCD blends I've tried. Just one drop will have you smelling like freshly baked cupcakes for the whole day. Between this and Swindle, there's definitely a bit of an overlap, but I might pick this one simple because the light touch of lavender just gives an extra something special to it for me. 

# Mendacity: Horchata - A comforting creation to soothe the soul. Classic horchata made from jasmine rice, demerara sugar, and true Ceylon cinnamon.

I have complex feelings about rice notes. That is to say, I love rice, yet it seems a lot harder than I imagined it would be to find the perfect rice note - the same subtle sweetness from the wafting steam of steamed rice. To me, rice is warm, soft and sweet, but sometimes a lot of renditions of rice are oddly sharp and prickly (amaretto adjacent), or far too much musk and nothing much in between. 

This scent is 'fragrant', in the way that it feels more like an amaretto adjacent rendition of rice, and it's a note that evokes an abstract swatch of marble colored nuttiness, cold and static. The cinnamon here is slightly reminiscent of a discontinued favorite, Scare Tea Cat (Luminous Star Perfumes), but it lacks the same warmth, and despite the spices, Mendacity is a a surprisingly 'cold' scent for me. Having tried this on both me and my co-tester, I found that my skin amped more of a white sugar and rice combo, whereas it went surprisingly savoury and salty with the combination of the cinnamon on his skin.

For comparison - having tried Wool Over Your Eyes, the house's rice pudding scent, I found it a little too heavy on the cinnamon/cardamom/nutmeg, which is to say, a little too sharp - and while I have loved the brief spots of rice in Virtuous, it's overshadowed by its less than foodie fellows. For those who have tried it, this is virtually a less spice intense version of Wool Over Your Eyes, very much a fragrant take on a spiced rice concoction. I actually think this reminds me a lot of The Block Party (Sixteen92), but to be honest, it's not a scent I'd reach for when it exists on the same shelf as Madar and Soft (Poesie). I really do wish I liked this scent more, but YMMV - I imagine the spice fiends will love this one as a warm, cozy scent for autumn to wear with beige linen and starched cotton sheets. 

# Knavery: Fig Clafoutis - A seductive aroma to attract that which you desire. A fluffy, oven-baked pancake bursting with richly flavored fruit. Hints of port wine and bright orange zest accentuate this decadent dessert.  

The opening of this scent is gorgeous and luxuriously fruity - it's fresh creamy fig, before immediately settling down into a combination of honeyed dessert wine and sticky port, drizzled on top of sweet pancakes. The fig isn't quite as dominant, yet the subtle sweetness of the fig syrup clings on strong, dotting the edges of decadently buttered pancake. For me, this is a delicious simple blend of figs and pancake, and it's a very hyperrealistic piping hot pancakes, before easing off into more of a light fruity syrup for the rest of the wear. This is one of the rare scents that doesn't feature any of the heavier maple profiles in it at all, and I relish the simplicity and refreshing sweetness of this one - definitely worth checking out if you're into pancake notes (which I very much am). The pancakes here also reminds me a little of The Nice List (Sixteen92) although without as much maple syrup, and I've been looking for something similar for a while - it's definitely worth checking out! 

# Pseudology: Pistachio Gelato - A luxurious blend for sensory fulfillment. Creamy-smooth pistachio butter, chilled fresh cream, and an abundance of sugar.

I really love how this collection has seemingly reinvented their nuts catalogue here - just like the almond, this pistachio accord seems especially pronounced and utterly delicious. I'm extremely partial to pistachio gelato myself, and I can definitely tell you this is by far the best, most hyperrealistic take on pistachio I've ever had the pleasure of trying - it's nutty, while still retaining that little bite of green grassiness at the very end. If you've been looking for a good pistachio, do yourself and check this one out. However, this lovely scent comes with a caveat - depending on skin chemistry, the pistachio will either flourish or flop on your skin. As I tend to amp sweetness in scents, while the opening of this scent is lovely and gorgeous, post dry down, the scent is far more of a tempered, subtly nutty sugared cream, flecked with chopped pistachio, but a friend I tested this scent just amped the roasted nuttiness of the pistachio on their skin, and definitely went full pistachio gelato. I am definitely sad that this isn't quite as beautifully true to the pistachio note on my skin, but I can always dab a little bit of this in a scent locket, or whatever other method that avoids it interacting too much with my skin chemistry. Nevertheless, I love sniffing this one. 

# Artful Dodger: Chewy Pink Candy - The distinctive scent of popular pink candy chews that shall remain nameless but are definitely not a reference to a supernova.  

This is an interesting scent, but one that really benefits from a little bit of rest. On my first wear, I found myself wading through scrubber territory, a clash of strawberry hard candies submerged in a puddle of white florals and oceanic musk, but upon revisiting this, it's mellowed out wonderfully, softening into more of a simple watermelon hard candy scent. It's relatively linear with both application and dry down, although the watermelon eases off into more of a indistinct fruity sweetness during the later parts of wear. Personally, I think NCD has one of the loveliest watermelon accords I've tried, and I was a big fan of their discontinued scent Yemaya, which has a really fresh and juicy quality to the watermelon, although this one reads a little more like artificial hard candy, which definitely works in favor of the scent. As I mentioned, it's rare for the house to come out with more of the fresh, fruity and lighter types of scents as there's usually a more complex richness to their blends, but this one was a lovely change of pace after it settles down into the skin - just to cheer yourself right up. It's not my favorite of this line up personally, but I can't deny its charm. 

# Original Prankster : Snickerdoodle - Fresh from the oven, crisp cinnamon sugar gives way to warm, soft vanilla cookie with just a trace of salted butter.

I'm surprisingly fond of this scent - I'm not a huge snickerdoodle fan because I find it to be a sort of bland and boring, and clearly inferior to chewy chocolate chip cookies, but this scent brings all these dimensions to a snickerdoodle that I've never experienced and I'm in love. The pairing of the soft vanilla butter here is gorgeous, it has this golden rich amber like color, and its impeccably sweet and delicious. The harmony of soft vanilla cookies here is complimented with the generous sprinkle of cinnamon sugar here - it's spiced, it's a little fiesty, but it's still sweet when it needs to be. With this brush of nuttiness, the sweetness of the vanilla and the dough, this scent manages to feel warm, like it's just fresh out of the oven, but the butter is never overwhelmingly thick or oppressive, it manages to stay light and creamy. This has medium throw, with fairly good wear. As I continued to wear this around the 3 hour mark, I found that on my skin, this scent pulls almost a little fruity, like a speckle of buttered caramelised apples, but it's a lovely shift in the scent profile. Definitely one of my favorites from this collection this time. 

# Tomfoolery : Oatmeal Raisin Cookie - Toasted oats, molten brown sugar, candied crushed walnuts, and tangy-sweet golden raisins.

While wet, this is absolutely oozing with whiskey and rum - it's a strong shot of booze soaked into raisins and lit on fire. After dry down, the booziness and the raisins are a little more tempered down and reassured, letting the nuttiness of the oats peeking through with the indulgent swirl of sticky toffee and darkened caramel. The crushed walnuts add a bitterness, and a dustiness from real walnuts. For me this scent was insanely strong, even when opening the vial I was hit with the boozy raisin scent, but as the nuttiness starts to bloom on the skin, it's absolutely beautiful. It reminds me a lot of Codswallop, but I have to say, I love the nuttiness of this one that Codswallop lacks, and with the brief hint of crushed walnuts and that extra bitterness, I think it gives a lot of depth, adding darker shades of grey to compliment what might otherwise be a pretty linear, one note sweet scent. I'm unexpectedly taken with this one!  

# Hooligan : Dirty Chai - One shot of espresso in steamed oatmilk and Assam tea spiced with nutmeg, ginger, allspice, cardamom, cinnamon, and clove.

As someone who almost never drinks coffee, I still love the scent of a coffee shop. Even from the vial, this gave me a strong hit of a freshly brewed shot of espresso - but on closer inspection, on application, this scent instantly turned incredibly fruity on my skin. This went from a spiced espresso to, strangely enough, lemongrass and orange toilet cleaner mixed with coffee when I huff very close to my skin - although this mercifully vanishes over time. Also, the projection and throw of this scent gives it a lot of room to breathe, and it's giving me more coffee with a heavy dose of sugar and cream with just the barest hint of spice hanging around at the edges, blossoming into a very 'coffee shop' scent. It eventually fades out into a softer, Kopi candy kinda scent, and that's definitely when it really got me good. Despite its oddly fruity opening, and although it wasn't quite what I was imagining for a scent called dirty chai, without much chai at all, it grew on me, tapping into all the right things I like about a coffee scent, although I really had to give it a chance past the initial twenty minutes. I'll definitely be reaching for this one if I'm trying to charm anyone who loves coffee. 

# Rapscallion : Orange Creamsicle -  Dark, indulgent vanilla contrasts with the fresh juice and zest of Valencia orange. The two are united with frothy sugared cream.

I've loved creamsicle scents since the first time I tried a Sugarpill liquid lip, and that's sort of the peak of creamsicles for me. I've never actually had a real creamsicle because apparently, they're not a thing where I am, but based off the various creamscicle inspired blends I've tried, I think I have a pretty good idea of what they smell/taste like. Rapscallion, however, smells nothing like any of the blends I've tried before. The orange here is more of a bitter, orange rind, blood orange accord, paired with a mature creamy vanilla, before drying down to a scent more akin to whipped cream and the crumbs of a poppyseed and lemon zest muffins. I don't really feel 'creamsicle' from this scent at all - a sort of, mixed signals vibe, like I'm not sure what it's going for, but whatever it is, it's not quite there for me.  

# Rascal : Apricot Thumbprint Cookie - Apricots simmered in brown and white sugars with a tablespoon each of brandy and Grand Marnier, crisp shortbread cookies touched with allspice, nutmeg, and toasted almond.

If you're a fan of Crone's Cottage - one of the autumn gourmands, this is definitely one to look out for. It's definitely a lighter, more playful counterpart to Crone's Cottage due to the burst of candied apricots, but it's complimented with a party bag of spices, allspice, nutmeg, and an almost savory burst of pepper, with a swirl of darkened caramel. It has a smokey, warm note here that's giving atmospheric vibes, a cozy retreat, indulging in baked spiced apricots. I like this scent, but this is one of those scents you'd absolutely adore if you live in a cold area - it radiates crackling wood fires and brown sugar porridge and cottages in the woods. I think it's very cottagecore - who doesn't want to channel the energy of a friendly kitchen witch dressed in linen and picking fruit in the woods?  

# Charlatan : French Almond Macaron - Crisp-tender pillows conjured from confectioners sugar, finely sifted almond flour, and Madagascar vanilla, united by smooth almond frangipane.

This is gorgeous, I've seen a few impressions of this scent singing its praises, and I'm going to join the choir here - this is delicious. Although the opening really frightened me with its strong almond note (and I am not a big fan of how almond is usually too sharp in most blends), it immediately dries down into the most beautiful soft vanilla and the nutty edge of almond meal. I'm kind of obsessed with how the almond note is so soft and photorealistic here, since its usually a big miss for me, but I just cannot tell you how good this is. This scent is pretty linear in its wear after dry down, with just more of the soft almond paired with puffs of sugar and a dash of vanilla extract, although there's a slight touch of orange rind in there for me that just adds a little zestyness for me. Compared to the darker, denser scents, this definitely errs on the side of lighter and fainter wear for me, the projection and throw of this one wears a lot closer to the skin compared to something like Scallywag, but it still clocks in a good 3-4 hours for how soft and delicate this is. The later stages of this scent is very much a fluffy vanilla, still yummy, just a little more simple. 

# Scoundrel : Blue Cotton Candy - Our blue cotton candy accord is spun from silken tonka, Mexican vanilla bean, sparkling sugar, marshmallow fluff, preserved Damson plum, and barely a twinkle of unripe bergamot. 

I was a little surprised by this one - although I was expecting something along the lines of sickeningly sweet tooth aching spun sugar (ala CocoaPink style), this is a reserved but ethereal take on cotton candy. Like, grown up cotton candy. The imprint of a memory of cotton candy distilled in a single tear. I can only describe the blue aspect of this as somewhat akin to the blue chamomile accord from Entombed (NCD), like a glimmer of twilight and frayed silk. The bergamot comes through as a little touch of squeeze of lemon here, paired with the sourness of the plum. For me, this is a very soft muted scent, like a whisper of fruit jam and a smear of simple syrup, and the melted remains of spun sugar. I can't say this is a cotton candy blend I'll be reaching for very often, but this is definitely a gourmand for people who are not usually fans of gourmands - a soft entry, just a dip in the sugar pool. 

# Scallywag : Chocolate Fudge Brownie - True cocoa absolute accentuated by notes of caramelized sugar, toasted marshmallow, Bavarian cream, and the subtlest touch of melted butter.  

When asked what was the 'must try' of this collection, Forest recommended Scallywag, and honestly, she was 100% correct and I'm absolutely kicking myself for not having full sized this. The house's chocolate accord is definitely more cocoa absolute, but in a way that isn't at all dry or dusty. I was a huge fan of Kazzate, a tiramisu dusted with cocoa powder, and Hell Freezes Over from their Yule collection, a beautiful dense chocolate cake decorated with crushed peppermint, and this happens to be like, the last missing piece of the trifecta of chocolatey dessert perfection for me. Everything I loved about Hell Freezes Over is here but richer, the gorgeous chocolate cake went from a slice of simple mud cake dusted with cocoa powder to decked out in scoops of cold Bavarian cream, nets of maple caramel and little indulgent dots of melty soft marshmallow and a drizzle of bourbon. The opening of this scent really gives me a whiff of spiked Bavarian cream, but its tamed on the dry down, really letting the dense chocolate cake here take the wheel - and I absolutely love it. I honestly don't even think real chocolate brownies could measure up to the image of chocolate perfection here. Yum. 10/10. Original Prankster : Snickerdoodle - Fresh from the oven, crisp cinnamon sugar gives way to warm, soft vanilla cookie with just a trace of salted butter.

I'm surprisingly fond of this scent - I'm not a huge snickerdoodle fan because I find it to be a sort of bland and boring, and clearly inferior to chewy chocolate chip cookies, but this scent brings all these dimensions to a snickerdoodle that I've never experienced and I'm in love.

It reminds me a lot of Codswallop, but I have to say, I love the nuttiness of this one that Codswallop lacks, and with the brief hint of crushed walnuts and that extra bitterness, I think it gives a lot of depth, adding darker shades of grey to compliment what might otherwise be a pretty linear, one note sweet scent. I'm unexpectedly taken with this one!  

# Hooligan : Dirty Chai - One shot of espresso in steamed oatmilk and Assam tea spiced with nutmeg, ginger, allspice, cardamom, cinnamon, and clove.

As someone who almost never drinks coffee, I still love the scent of a coffee shop.

If you're a fan of Crone's Cottage - one of the autumn gourmands, this is definitely one to look out for.

The later stages of this scent is very much a fluffy vanilla, still yummy, just a little more simple.

I was a little surprised by this one - although I was expecting something along the lines of sickeningly sweet tooth aching spun sugar (ala CocoaPink style), this is a reserved but ethereal take on cotton candy. Like, grown up cotton candy. The imprint of a memory of cotton candy distilled in a single tear. I can only describe the blue aspect of this as somewhat akin to the blue chamomile accord from Entombed (NCD), like a glimmer of twilight and frayed silk. The bergamot comes through as a little touch of squeeze of lemon here, paired with the sourness of the plum. For me, this is a very soft muted scent, like a whisper of fruit jam and a smear of simple syrup, and the melted remains of spun sugar. I can't say this is a cotton candy blend I'll be reaching for very often, but this is definitely a gourmand for people who are not usually fans of gourmands - a soft entry, just a dip in the sugar pool. 

# Scallywag : Chocolate Fudge Brownie - True cocoa absolute accentuated by notes of caramelized sugar, toasted marshmallow, Bavarian cream, and the subtlest touch of melted butter.  

When asked what was the 'must try' of this collection, Forest recommended Scallywag, and honestly, she was 100% correct and I'm absolutely kicking myself for not having full sized this. The house's chocolate accord is definitely more cocoa absolute, but in a way that isn't at all dry or dusty. I was a huge fan of Kazzate, a tiramisu dusted with cocoa powder, and Hell Freezes Over from their Yule collection, a beautiful dense chocolate cake decorated with crushed peppermint, and this happens to be like, the last missing piece of the trifecta of chocolatey dessert perfection for me. Everything I loved about Hell Freezes Over is here but richer, the gorgeous chocolate cake went from a slice of simple mud cake dusted with cocoa powder to decked out in scoops of cold Bavarian cream, nets of maple caramel and little indulgent dots of melty soft marshmallow and a drizzle of bourbon. The opening of this scent really gives me a whiff of spiked Bavarian cream, but its tamed on the dry down, really letting the dense chocolate cake here take the wheel - and I absolutely love it. I honestly don't even think real chocolate brownies could measure up to the image of chocolate perfection here. Yum. 10/10. ",5,1743176126.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

I am 2.5yrs out from my craniotomy and have been experiencing chronic fatigue for the past 2 years.  I didn’t have any radiation or chemo after surgery and have been just doing watch & wait. 

The oncologist I see for ongoing care said it’s not directly related to anything tumor related. 
My original doctor gave me lexapro to help the fatigue. It didn’t help that, but did help apparent anxiety so I kept taking it. 
They sent me to a sleep dr who did a sleep study and diagnosed me with ideopathic hypersomnia.  They gave me armodafinal that helped initially but they had to keep upping the dose to be effective. Eventually I told them the armodafinal helped with my apparent adhd but no longer doing much for the fatigue.  Their answer was to get tested for adhd and also said that the adhd caused the fatigue. (????) I was able to get diagnosed with adhd but everyone agreed it wasn’t related to the fatigue. 
By now I had a new physician who suggested I find a new sleep dr.  The new sleep dr said they don’t agree with the initial diagnosis from the prior sleep study and also I should’ve been taken off the lexapro prior to the study. So they set up a new study and told me to be off lexapro two weeks ahead of time. Unfortunately I misunderstood the tapering schedule and wasn’t off it long enough.  It was a shitty time going off the lexapro and I never restarted it pending the results so I wouldn’t have to go thru the withdrawal again.  I was told initially I didn’t have any sleep disorder and then that I would need to do another sleep study at my follow-up. 
I again have a new physician who said he thinks the fatigue could be just from the tumor and/or surgery but said doing another sleep study wouldn’t be a bad idea. 

I’m now at the point that I don’t see the point of continuing to do sleep studies.  Being off all stimulant medicines and coffee for a week really makes it hard to function, on top of the 24 hours needed to do the full test as well as the cost.

This will help give you an idea of how much you are saving/spending.  Doing this over 12 months also helps factor in seasonal variations, such as taxes and holiday spending.","**TLDR version:**

A basic financial forecast tracks how much money you are taking in (income) and how much you are spending (expenses).  The difference between the two is how much you are saving (or not saving).  If you are regularly spending more than you are saving, then eventually that catches up to you.

**Income - Spending = Saving**

**More detailed version**:

INCOME SIDE:

If you have a regular-paying job, then your income is probably fairly predictable.  And if your income goes up and down throughout the year, then it is even more important that you track to get a sense of when your ""lean times"" will be. 

Tracking income over 12 months also helps factor in things like holiday bonuses or months with 3 paychecks instead of 2.

EXPENSE SIDE:

For most people, tracking expenses is harder.  There are certain expenses that are predictable, such as rent/mortgage, utility bills, cell phone bill, etc.  Those should be pretty easy to calculate.

Food and groceries are probably one of the largest components of spending but also hard to predict.  For groceries, get a receipt when you go shopping and enter it into a spreadsheet.  For eating out, make sure you include smaller things like coffees and drinks, as those can add up.

Tracking expenses over 12 months also factors in less frequent items, such as travel or holiday spending.  Those tend to be one-time but bigger items so they can definitely have an impact.

And don't forget to factor in taxes.  April is generally when you either make a big tax payment or get a refund, but either one of those can change your savings calculation quite a bit.

Nobody likes to track their spending but most people are probably spending more than they realize, so tracking helps make it a bit more real.  Good luck.",4,1743175713.0,LifeProTips,3,0.6,False
1jlxpvz,https://v.redd.it/61gaz5pr7gre1,A Tale Of Two Americas: America Below,"You wake up at 6 a.m., exhausted. You didn’t sleep well because your second job kept you out late or your mind was spinning about bills or rent or whether your car will survive another month, your headache is preventing you from knowing which. You chug some coffee, maybe skip breakfast, and get ready for a job that barely covers your expenses. If you’re lucky, you have health insurance but it comes with a $4,000 deductible you can’t afford to use.

You drive to work on roads full of potholes, past homeless encampments, wondering if that could be you in a few years. You spend 8–10 hours doing work that’s either mind-numbing or physically draining. Your boss calls it “family,” but they’d fire you over a spreadsheet. Lunch is whatever you could throw together—fast food, maybe leftovers—eaten in 15 minutes before getting back on the clock.

After work, you might head to your second job, or home to take care of kids, parents, or both. You don’t have time to relax. You don’t have energy to cook. Groceries are expensive. Everything is expensive. And god help you if you get sick, get a flat tire, or need dental work. You check your bank account: two digits. Maybe three.

Your rent just went up. Again. But your wages didn’t. You can’t afford to buy a house, and even if you could, the mortgage rates are absurd. You’re not saving for retirement. You’re just trying to survive until next month. Maybe you take a weekend off once a year. Maybe. But mostly, you grind. Because if you stop for even a second, everything falls apart.

The news tells you inflation is under control. The job market is great. The economy is booming. But it never trickles down. All you see are billionaires getting richer, politicians getting donations, and corporations laying off workers to please shareholders. You’re told to work harder, learn to code, drink less coffee, be grateful.

This is the life most Americans live in some form. I’m sure most of you have faced some of these struggles. know the truth:

The system isn’t broken. It’s working exactly as intended. And it’s grinding people like you into dust to keep the machine running.

Most people have never heard of BlackRock, Vanguard, or State Street, but these three financial giants quietly own huge chunks of the entire economy.

These three firms control $25+ trillion combined and hold major stakes in nearly every industry: tech, oil, housing, weapons, food, and healthcare. If it’s in the S&P 500, they probably own a piece of it—and usually a big one. Their money fuels mass incarceration, deportation centers, and climate destruction, all while hiding behind 401(k)s, pensions, and public funds.

They’re not just investors. They’re kingmakers. They vote in boardrooms, shape corporate policies, and influence national economic trends  while pretending to be invisible. They quietly profit while we suffer.


Here’s how we hit them where it hurts:

1. Pull the Plug on Their Funding

•	Demand states, cities, and universities divest from these firms—especially from prison and fossil fuel investments.

•	Target public pension funds (like CALPERS or state teacher retirement systems).

•	Pressure labor unions to move their money elsewhere.

Every dollar pulled weakens their grip.

2. Expose the Monopoly
	
•	These firms own stakes in competing corporations—which kills real competition and inflates prices.
	
•	Demand antitrust action and bans on cross-ownership in key industries (energy, healthcare, housing, food).

•	Push for full ownership transparency.

Shine a light on their monopoly—and break it.

3. Take Back Our Retirement
	
•	Most people are tied to these firms through 401(k)s or IRAs without consent.
	
•	Fight for public or union-run retirement options.
	
•	Demand control over our own shareholder votes—not theirs.

Our savings shouldn’t bankroll oppression.

4. Tax the Empire
	
•	Support a Financial Transaction Tax to make speculation expensive.
	
•	Tax unrealized gains on mega-firms hoarding wealth.

•	Penalize investments in prisons, ICE contractors, fossil fuels, and surveillance tech.

If they profit off misery then they should pay for it.

5. Build Alternatives
	
•	Invest in worker-owned co-ops, credit unions, and public banks.
	
•	Create state- and city-run investment firms that serve people, not Wall Street.
	
•	Launch postal banking and public financial tools for communities.

Starve the beast, build the future.

6. Boycott, Disrupt, Expose
	
•	Organize boycotts of companies backed by BlackRock and Vanguard (start with GEO Group, CoreCivic, ICE contractors).
	
•	Build viral campaigns:
“Break BlackRock”
“Divest from Death”
“No Prisons in Our Portfolios”
	
•	Use shareholder protests and digital pressure to force their hand.

Name them. Shame them. Strip their power.

7. Use State Power
	
•	Pass state laws banning investment in human rights abusers.
	
•	Force contract transparency for firms doing business with public agencies.
	
•	Push ballot initiatives to redirect public funds to ethical investments.

Congress may be slow but the states can move now.

The Bottom Line:

BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street run on secrecy, complexity, and our money.
If we cut off their public funding, expose their monopoly, and build new systems, we don’t just weaken them.
We build a future that works for people, not profit.

Let’s mobilize. Let’s divest. Let’s disrupt.

I've been on the dating apps for a while and made some friends on there that i still talk to but never felt any emotional connections with my dates.

About Me 32 Male Asian (Chinese) American, 5'6"" 170lbs Athletic build, Aquarius, ESFJ, Type A, Drinks, Doesn't smoke, Not Religious, Not too political, Remote Job

I would say i'm quite independent, financially literate, and a mix of a homebody/adventure seeker.

Interests I absolutely love learning new things and will always try something once. Always curious and open to all life has to offer. I'll list some of my interests below but its not just limited to this.

TV/Movies- Big fan of thriller/mystery but am open to all genres as well as kdrama/cdrama. Most recent shows i've seen are (When Life Gives You Tangerines, Mouse, The Double, Legend of Shen Li, Severance, Silo). I don't keep up with anime since it takes up way too much time but i dont mind if you enjoy it. I also love watching musicals so wouldn't mind having someone to join me.

Sports - I don't really play sports too much but i do workout regularly. This is mostly so i can stay healthy and eat more, i'm a big foodie lol. I play Fantasy Basketball/Football and watch both sports occasionally.

Games - Not a big gamer anymore but i get hooked occasionally. Used to play League and still play once in a while. I do enjoy games that require more social interaction like Jackbox these days but dont mind rogue like such as Balatro/Slay the Spire.

Books - I haven't read too much but used to read a lot of manga/light novels. Similar to movies, i enjoy thriller/mystery/dystopian types of stories. If i do pick up a book, i tend to get hooked and will lose sleep trying to finish it.

Music - No huge preference but i lean towards EDM/RNB/Lofi/Asian Pop. It really depends on the mood. Wouldn't mind some classical (Mozart/Vivaldi) or Emo either!

Just a list of some other interests: Hiking, scenic views, nature, cooking, minimalist/clean space, coffee (have a drip and espresso machine), hosting, board games, making new connections, solo trips, investing/budgetting, skincare, fashion, cocktail bars, yoga, pottery, etc. I could go on forever

Seeking

Preferably +-5 years of age but feel free to message me, always open to new connections

Be employed or working towards a career. Financial literacy is important to me.

No kids but wants to have kids in the future

I dont smoke but im 420 friendly. I rather its something you do in moderation and not something you indulge in every day/week

You're an optimist, can take a joke, and enjoy a good roast to flirt ratio. Someone that can take constructive criticism as well as provide it.

No food allergies preferred, i love cooking for others and would want you to taste test different recipes. Also going out to new restaurants and trying everything on the menu.

Please be somewhat active/fit. I travel for leisure (2-3 new destinations a year) and walk a lot. Would prefer to have someone that enjoys walking

Indepdent. Someone that puts in the work and wants to grow

Feel free to message me if you want to know more. I do think mutual attraction plays a big part in dating so i dont mind sharing photos if we connect! I rather not post it all over Reddit.

They don't seem to get full and they get hungry so quickly. At the wedding there was a kitchen despite it being the outdoor venue but they couldn't use anything so she just kept drinking coffee but he ended up going home as apparently that was the closest toilet so I had him make a meal there before coming back.

On the bright side - her karma got to 'best' so she got a message from anon saying they wanted to reward her, for giggles I chose lottery - it said it would up the chances some so I thought it would just be like a few k maybe, nope she bought a ticket and won 1m.

It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Hi!
I'm sorry. You're talking.
Yes, I know.
You're talking!
I'm so sorry.
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.
Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.
Wait! How did you learn to do that?
What?
The talking thing.
Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.
That's very funny.
Yeah.
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Anyway... Can I... get you something?
Like what?
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
It's just coffee.
I hate to impose.
Don't be ridiculous!
Actually, I would love a cup.
Hey, you want rum cake?
I shouldn't.
Have some.
No, I can't.
Come on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
Where?
These stripes don't help.
You look great!
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
Are you all right?
No.
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
He finally gets there.
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.
And he says, ""Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.
Why would I marry a watermelon?""
Is that a bee joke?
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
About work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.
You do?
Sure.
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
Really?
My only interest is flowers.
Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?
You're in Sheep Meadow!
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
Why do girls put rings on their toes?
Why not?
It's like putting a hat on your knee.
Maybe I'll try that.
You all right, ma'am?
Oh, yeah. Fine.
Just having two cups of coffee!
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's no trouble.
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
Are you...?
Can I take a piece of this with me?
Sure! Here, have a crumb.
Thanks!
Yeah.
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
OK, Barry.
And thank you so much again... for before.
Oh, that? That was nothing.
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
This can't possibly work.
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
Sounds amazing.
It was amazing!
It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.
Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
Some of them. But some of them don't.
How'd you get back?
Poodle.
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
Well...
Well?
Well, I met someone.
You did? Was she Bee-ish?
A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
No, no, no, not a wasp.
Spider?
I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.
So who is she?
She's... human.
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
Her name's Vanessa.
Oh, boy.
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
We're not dating.
You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
She saved my life! And she understands me.
This is over!
Eat this.
This is not over! What was that?
They call it a crumb.
It was so stingin' stripey!
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!
You know what a Cinnabon is?
No.
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...
Sit down!
...really hot!
Listen to me!
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
Thinking bee.
Thinking bee.
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
There he is. He's in the pool.
You know what your problem is, Barry?
I gotta start thinking bee?
How much longer will this go on?
It's been three days! Why aren't you working?
I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!
Would it kill you to make a little honey?
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
Martin, would you talk to him?
Barry, I'm talking to you!
You coming?
Got everything?
All set!
Go ahead. I'll catch up.
Don't be too long.
Watch this!
Vanessa!
We're still here.
I told you not to yell at him.
He doesn't respond to yelling!
Then why yell at me?
Because you don't listen!
I'm not listening to this.
Sorry, I've gotta go.
Where are you going?
I'm meeting a friend.
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
Bye.
I just hope she's Bee-ish.
They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?
It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
You don't have that?
We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
Oh, my.
Dumb bees!
You must want to sting all those jerks.
We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
So you have to watch your temper.
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
Yeah.
What is wrong with you?!
It's a bug.
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
Yeah, it was. How did you know?
It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
You've really got that down to a science.
I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
I'll bet.
What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?
Is he that actor?
I never heard of him.
Why is this here?
For people. We eat it.
You don't have enough food of your own?
Well, yes.
How do you get it?
Bees make it.
I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!
There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
It's organic.
It's our-ganic!
It's just honey, Barry.
Just what?!
Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!
And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.
I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!
Hey, Hector. You almost done?
Almost.
He is here. I sense it.
Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
You're busted, box boy!
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
The last thing we want to do is upset bees!
You're too late! It's ours now!
You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!
You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!
Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
Crazy person!
What horrible thing has happened here?
These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now
they're on the road to nowhere!
Just keep still.
What? You're not dead?
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?
To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
I'm going to Tacoma.
And you?
He really is dead.
All right.
Uh-oh!
What is that?!
Oh, no!
A wiper! Triple blade!
Triple blade?
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!
How much do you people need to see?!
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Carl Kasell.
But don't kill no more bugs!
Bee!
Moose blood guy!!
You hear something?
Like what?
Like tiny screaming.
Turn off the radio.
Whassup, bee boy?
Hey, Blood.
Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.
Wow!
I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.
Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in.
It's a close community.
Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.
What if you get in trouble?
You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!
At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.
Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
You got to be kidding me!
Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!
Hey, guys!
Mooseblood!
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.
What is this place?
A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.
They are pinheads!
Pinhead.
Check out the new smoker.
Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000!
Smoker?
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.
They make the honey, and we make the money.
""They make the honey, and we make the money""?
Oh, my!
What's going on? Are you OK?
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?
Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.
This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen!
What is this?
Oh, no!
There's hundreds of them!
Bee honey.
Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!
This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.
Oh, Barry, stop.
Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.
Do these look like rumors?
That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?
He's been talking to humans.
What? Talking to humans?!
He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!
Make out? Barry!
We do not.
You wish you could.
Whose side are you on?
The bees!
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?
I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!
Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked
your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.
I remember that.
What right do they have to our honey?
We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
Sting them where it really hurts.
In the face! The eye!
That would hurt.
No.
Up the nose? That's a killer.
There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.
Hive at Five, The Hive's only full-hour action news source.
No more bee beards!
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung.
Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this""?
Bees have never been afraid to change the world.
What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.
How old are you?
The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.
You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.
It's a common name. Next week...
He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...
Next week...
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.
Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.
In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.
Is that that same bee?
Yes, it is!
I'm helping him sue the human race.
Hello.
Hello, bee.
This is Ken.
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
Why does he talk again?
Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.
But it's our yogurt night!
Bye-bye.
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!
Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.
Frosting...
How many sugars?
Just one. I try not to use the competition.
So why are you helping me?
Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.
Those are great, if you're three.
And artificial flowers.
Oh, those just get me psychotic!
Yeah, me too.
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
Bees must hate those fake things!
Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.
Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.
This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
I guess.
You sure you want to go through with it?
Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty!
It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
It's pretty big, isn't it?
I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.
You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?
Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.
What's the matter?
I don't know, I just got a chill.
Well, if it isn't the bee team.
You boys work on this?
All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.
All right. Case number 4475,
Superior Court of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?
A privilege.
Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.
Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.
I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!
Talking bee!
How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?
They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!
Mr. Benson?
Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.
Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!
I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!
Call your first witness.
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.
I suppose so.
I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.
Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.
I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?
No.
I couldn't hear you.
No.
No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
You mean like this?
Bears kill bees!
How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?
I was with a band called The Police.
But you've never been a police officer, have you?
No, I haven't.
No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.
Oh, please.
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
That's not his real name?! You idiots!
Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.
Thank you. Thank you.
I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?
Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!
Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!
Order in this court!
You're all thinking it!
Order! Order, I say!
Say it!
Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.
Are we doing everything right, legally?
I'm a florist.
Right. Well, here's to a great team.
To a great team!
Well, hello.
Ken!
Hello.
I didn't think you were coming.
No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
Oh, that was lucky.
There's a little left. I could heat it up.
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.
That's where I usually sit. Right... there.
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
You think I don't see what you're doing?
I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.
Do we?
Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
That's just what I was thinking about doing.
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
I'm going to drain the old stinger.
Yeah, you do that.
Look at that.
You know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games.
What's that?
Italian Vogue.
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
A lot of ads.
Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here!
I love the smell of flowers.
How do you like the smell of flames?!
Not as much.
Water bug! Not taking sides!
Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!
This is pathetic!
I've got issues!
Well, well, well, a royal flush!
You're bluffing.
Am I?
Surf's up, dude!
Poo water!
That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings!
Kenneth! What are you doing?!
You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!
We need to talk! He's just a little bee!
And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?
 No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!
Goodbye, Ken.
And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!
I'm sorry about all that.
I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!
I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.
Are you OK for the trial?
I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.
We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...
Yeah.
Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.
Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.
You got the tweezers?
Are you allergic?
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.
What exactly is your relationship to that woman?
We're friends.
Good friends?
Yes.
How good? Do you live together?
Wait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug?
I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?
Yeah, but...
So those aren't your real parents!
Oh, Barry...
Yes, they are!
Hold me back!
You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?
He's denouncing bees!
Don't y'all date your cousins?
Objection!
I'm going to pincushion this guy!
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit!
Order! Order!
The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!
Adam, stay with me.
I can't feel my legs.
What Angel of Mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks?
I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please!
The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed Turn Against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Is there much pain?
Yeah.
I... I blew the whole case, didn't I?
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it.
What was it like to sting someone?
I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!
All right.
You think it was all a trap?
Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.
What will the humans do to us if they win?
I don't know.
I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.
Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!
Oh, my.
Could you get a nurse to close that window?
Why?
The smoke.
Bees don't smoke.
Right. Bees don't smoke.
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.
That's it! That's our case!
It is? It's not over?
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.
Mr. Flayman.
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
Where is the rest of your team?
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time.
I actually heard a funny story about...
Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?
They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.
I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.
But you can't! We have a terrific case.
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?
Show me the smoking gun!
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun.
What is that?
It's a bee smoker!
What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.
Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps?
Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?
What are we gonna do?
He's playing the species card.
Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!
Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees!
The court finds in favor of the bees!
Vanessa, we won!
I knew you could do it! High-five!
Sorry.
I'm OK! You know what this means?
All the honey will finally belong to the bees.
Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.
This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.
You'll regret this.
Barry, how much honey is out there?
All right. One at a time.
Barry, who are you wearing?
My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.
What if Montgomery's right?
What do you mean?
We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.
Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.
Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.
We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.
We're all aware of what they do in the woods.
Wait for my signal. Take him out.
He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...
But it's just a prance-about stage name!
...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.
Can't breathe.
Bring it in, boys!
Hold it right there! Good.
Tap it.
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups and there's gallons more coming!
I think we need to shut down!
Shut down? We've never shut down.
Shut down honey production!
Stop making honey!
Turn your key, sir!
What do we do now?
Cannonball!
We're shutting honey production!
Mission abort.
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.
Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.
Oh, yeah?
What's going on? Where is everybody?
Are they out celebrating?
They're home.
They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.
I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.
At least we got our honey back.
Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.
This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now...
Now I can't.
I don't understand why they're not happy.
I thought their lives would be better!
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.
You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?
What did you want to show me?
This.
What happened here?
That is not the half of it.
Oh, no. Oh, my.
They're all wilting.
Doesn't look very good, does it?
No.
And whose fault do you think that is?
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
Bees?
Specifically, me.
I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.

**Why This Pick?**

The Clippers are undoubtedly the hottest team in the league right now – and while the Nets have been fairly solid in the spread covering department, I’m willing to bet that Los Angeles is just too big a juggernaut for them at this stage. The Clippers absolutely smoked the Nets by 59 points in their last meeting, and it’s looking like Brooklyn could be without a lot of their man power this evening. This matchup is just too one-sided for me to entertain the idea that the game will be a close one – especially since the Clippers are fresh off a 13-point win over the NY Knicks.  I’m on LA to cover today, friends.

***Legend of Korra*****’s Janet Varney,** ***Hamilton*****’s Alexander Ferguson, and** ***Suff*****’s Housso Semon Lead the New Chen Drachman Film, marking her return to the Dubuque International Film Festival**



***\[Dubuque, Iowa - 3/28/2025\]*** – The Julien Dubuque International Film Festival has announced that Chen Drachman’s latest short film, *But I’m a Shoe* has been officially selected for its 14th year. This is Drachman’s second acceptance into the festival, after her first film, *The Book of Ruth* starring Tovah Feldshuh, screened at the festival in 2021. 

“I’m thrilled to return for this year’s JDIFF,” said Drachman. “I remember my previous experience at the festival as one of the best I’ve ever had at a film festival.

Drachman’s film stars Janet Varney (*The Legend of Korra, You’re the Worst, Platonic*) as well as Broadway’s *Hamilton*’s Alexander Ferguson (Hamilton, Burr) and *Suff*’s Housso Semon (Ida B. Wells). The film will be screened twice alongside other exceptional works from filmmakers from around the globe. As part of the festival, Drachman will also participate in a post-screening Q&A session, offering audiences an exclusive look into her creative process.

**Drachman also launched a special collaboration with the beloved local River Lights Bookstore, where Varney’s fans can get free signed items upon showing proof of purchase for one of the screenings, as well as 15% off for a one time purchase at the store when presenting any festival pass.**

The Julien Dubuque International Film Festival, now in its 14th year, is listed in MovieMaker Magazine as one of the best festivals. It is a celebration of independent filmmaking, providing a platform to connect with audiences and industry professionals right on the bank of the Mississippi River. This year’s event promises a rich lineup of films spanning genres, as well as a variety of panels and network opportunities for the guests.

Key Details:

* Screening Dates for Shorts Block 6: 4/24/2025 (01:00 PM), 4/27/2025 (07:00 PM)
* Both screenings will take place at the Five Flags Center. Bijou Room.
* Chen will also be a part of a one-on-one Coffee talk as part of the festival.
* Free Movie Merchandise and book discounts available with proof of purchase at River Lights Bookstore, 1098 Main St, Dubuque, IA 52001.

We’re talking holes in walls, shattered furniture, and stains everywhere. Today, we’ll see what she went through—and ask you, why do some people want to live in chaos?*

Every apartment they moved into started with so much hope. A clean slate. A fresh space to turn into a home. But it never stayed that way for long—not with him around.

He punched holes in the doors. Slammed them so hard, he split the door jamb. Threw coffee at the wall and left a giant stain. Scratches on the walls like they had kids or pets… but they didn’t. Just him.

Every place ended the same way—ruined. Security deposits gone. Landlords angry. Nothing ever clean, nothing ever calm. She'd find sticky hard candy on her favorite blanket. Socks in the bed. Dishes stacked up for days. Floors never swept. Trash never taken out.

And the furniture? Forget it. She couldn't buy anything nice. If she did, he’d break it. Smashed chairs. Dented tables. Even their brand new washer got gouged with deep scratches from his toolbox.

It felt like he *wanted* to live in a dump. Like he fed off destruction. But it wasn’t just the apartment—he was tearing *her* down too. The verbal abuse. The physical outbursts. The chaos he created on the outside matched the chaos he caused inside her.

Eventually, she couldn’t take it anymore. She walked away from the mess, the violence, and the man who made their lives look like disaster zones.

A fetish is when you learned to really like a particular thing/fantasy

You had to learn to like it, meaning it didn't appeal to you at **first**

Just like coffee, at first you probably didn't like it

But with time you started to like it because of different reasons

This is what we call a ***""learned preference""***

But that preference is built up because of the meaning you give to that thing/fantasy

For example, some people personal meaning when they see homosexual p\*rn is that it's weird

Whilst some people see it as a way to express themselves and as something totally normal right?

But that's what we got to question is

***What is the personal meaning you give to that fetish?***

Without judging yourself, feeling shame, feeling guilt

**Accept that yes, you do like that fetish, you want to do it, embrace it** 

**And then ask yourself, but what do I like about it?**

*And go in depth*

So over the last year, I went through a ton of anxiety. I got into therapy and even still, it was hard to control and work through this issue. I found that dating severely exacerbated the problem, and hence, since around January 2025, I decided to just take life easy. No pressure to meet anyone, just be grateful for each day I wake up alive.

I was doing pretty well with this mindset. On Super Bowl weekend, I was just having a chill Saturday when I started craving beer. I decided to take myself out to a bar, no more than 5 mins from where I live. I walked over, sat down, and all I wanted was a couple beers, no intention of meeting anyone or making any conversation. 

This girl shows up around 30 mins after and sits next to me. I’m not sure how we started talking but we did. While talking to her, she asked me where do I like getting coffee around the neighborhood. I didn’t take any hint and started listing cafes I do not like and find overpriced, she immediately said something like “oh, I was hoping we could go there for a coffee date”, I immediately backtracked saying “oh sweet! i do like other stuff there just not the coffee” lmao. We spoke for some more time before she had to leave. She asked me for my number and immediately left me a text with her name, etc. 

A few mins after she left, she texted me again saying she didn’t really have anything to do at home and was wondering if she could come back to the bar and if I was still there. She lived super close, and I was indeed still at the bar so I asked her to come back. This time, we stayed till like 2:30, talking about a bunch of stuff, she held my hand and we even planned our next date etc. When the bar closed, I walked her back to her apartment, we hugged and she asked me to text her when I get back to mine. 

As I said, my place was maybe a 5 min walk from the bar, but even still, before I got home she had already texted me saying how much of a good time she had and asking if I got back. We texted till 3:30 or so before I passed out. Next morning I saw her texts from last night and responded. She took a few hours to respond, saying she’d have to take a rain check for our coffee plans today as she had a bunch of stuff to do for school. I texted her something about the super bowl that day, and that’s it. Never heard from her again. Completely ghosted!

Now I have been ghosted by women I’ve met at a bar before, but I’d like to think I’m pretty self aware and a lot of those times, it felt like they weren’t fully into me even while we were talking, and gave me their numbers as a way to get out of it. This time was SO different. She asked me for my number and she was the one planning the next dates, she was also the one taking initiative while texting, and it genuinely felt like mutual interest!

Guess I’ll never know what went wrong but that makes me think there’s probably no point in continuing to look hahah

Anyone got any thoughts on what may have happened? I swear I wasn’t dreaming about any of this! ",3,1743174348.0,dating,2,1.0,False

A fetish is when you learned to really like a particular thing/fantasy

You had to learn to like it, meaning it didn't appeal to you at **first**

Just like coffee, at first you probably didn't like it

But with time you started to like it because of different reasons

This is what we call a ***""learned preference""***

But that preference is built up because of the meaning you give to that thing/fantasy

For example, some people personal meaning when they see homosexual p\*rn is that it's weird

Whilst some people see it as a way to express themselves and as something totally normal right?

But that's what we got to question is

***What is the personal meaning you give to that fetish?***

Without judging yourself, feeling shame, feeling guilt

**Accept that yes, you do like that fetish, you want to do it, embrace it** 

**And then ask yourself, but what do I like about it?**

*And go in depth*

You'll realize that till this day you **had reasons** for which you want to indulge in that fetish

That you never been aware of

And now that you are aware of them, you'll easily be able to dismiss them

1jlx6ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jlx6ey/amsterdam_café_impressions/,Amsterdam Café Impressions,"I use posts like this to figure out where to get coffee when I'm in new places so I figured I'd add one of my own too. I recently spent a weekend in Amsterdam and drank far too much coffee, I didn't get to try everywhere worth trying - it's a great city for coffee - but I did get to some of the more frequently recommended spots. I have these in order of preference but every coffee I had over there was enjoyable (except for the hotel batch brew).

**Dak Showroom**

Hands down my best coffee experience in Amsterdam, milky cake makes an excellent milk drink, the staff are interested and good to talk to and the space is more concept than café so it's very chill. My only regret is that I didn't get the chance to go back and try some more of the beans on their menu, though I did leave with some.

**Rum Baba**

I stopped by both locations and each time was greeted by enthusiastic staff with a lot of knowledge about coffee. The beans in their main grinders for espresso and batch brews were surprisingly adventurous; I had a really funky thermal processed light roast from Costa Rica in my flat white without asking for anything unusual, it was really enjoyable. The decaf offering was a Wilton Benitez, it's possibly the only time I've ever seen a cafe offer a decaf more premium than their standard coffee.

**Scandinavian Embassy**

The espresso here is really great, it's not challenging, it's a washed coffee with a balanced flavour profile and no big notes anywhere, but quietly fantastic and very full. I think it's coffee collective? They have both coffee collective and koppi for sale in the shop.

**Fuku**

There was a fairly straightforward Kenyan single origin in the main grinder when I stopped by here, the offer an incredible array of options if you want to try something else but I was travel weary and the space itself isn't very comfortable so I stuck to the main offering. The café itself missed the mark for me a bit but the coffee they roast is fantastic for the price point. I'm not sure if the hype had me expecting more or just caused an influx of Instagram natives but either way I think the strong point here is the roastery not the café.

**Hummingbird**

Hummingbirds coffee is their own blend roasted by Onyx coffee, it was darker than I was expecting but I was honestly surprised by the complexity, in a good way. I'm not sure if it will stay in their favour to offer an American coffee or this kind of flavour profile. They have a rotating selection from European roasters available to buy, they had KB roasters and Cloudpicker coffee when I went in, who are two great roasters that each offer something notably different to Onyx, so there's some good curation going on.

**Saint Jean**

This is an influencer magnet, there's a roped off section of footpath outside so people can queue to enter. The baked goods are indeed fantastic and the coffee is good, but it's not going to change your life or anything. There is a wall of Dak coffee for sale but the whole queue to enter vibe doesn't encourage browsing. If you want Dak you are much better off going to the showroom, you won't be missing out by not trying the Saint Jean blend and there's a much greater variety in the showroom. Saint Jean is very much worth it if you are vegan and miss croissants though.

I probably walked past twice as many good speciality cafés in the time I was there but you can only drink so much coffee in a couple of days. Toki, Good Beans, Back to Black and Uncommon would have been next on my list given the opportunity. I picked up some beans while I was there, all Columbian which wasn't intended but a good mix that I'm excited to try as both espresso and pour over. The Rum Baba Nestor Lasso I have high hopes for in espresso tonics, curious if anyone has tried it.

\----------PHASE 1----------

I was in 11th class when my parents decided to change my school coz I had a lot of tuition classes but didn't had enough time as it took me almost more than an hour to reach home from school. It was the school I was admitted/studying in from the very beginning so I had to leave everything behind so I started going to the new school and no-one treated me equally coz they had a thinking of ""I am from another school.""

I wear a turban and I'm a sikh and the school I got admitted to was a sikh school, I used to get bullied by people, they used to make fun of me and my turban a lot. As I was from an English medium school and didn't needed to wear turban (it wasn't mandatory, though it was in this school so it was new to me).

Furthermore, my mom's a tuition teacher and she teaches at home and the school I was migrated to, was max 30-40 metres from my house so children from that very particular school used to come to our house get taught by my mother so I had the opportunity to get all the question papers and solve them. To be honest they were a lot easier than the question paper in my school and I guess on the 3rd day of new school when I was talking to my new friends, I told them that I used to solve their school's papers and they were pretty easy (we were talking during lunch break). However, as soon as the lunch break got over, the chemistry teacher  came in the classroom and asked ""who said that our question papers are very easy?"". Everyone started staring at me and the teacher said if you think our papers are too easy, I'll see how you pass the exams and she was the best friend to the physics teacher as well (source: other classes and my class). I failed in chemistry the whole year even though I'd studied very hard and while distributing the answer sheets she even said ""This wasn't easy, was it? Be careful what you say from the next time"". And eventually I failed in 11th class.



\----------PHASE 2----------

In 8th class I made a friend (girl) and coincidentally her little brother used to come to our house for tuition classes by my mother. We met again in 10th class tuition 2 years later again. She then soon became one of my best friends. Fast forward to a few months of riding on scooter/eating snacks from some café together. There came a time when she broke up with her boyfriend and some days later I came in the ""relationship"" picture and asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she accepted it (she told me she said yes coz I'm her best friend), though it lasted only for 4 days probably and she further said we can't go back to what we were ""I'm sorry!"".

Further down the road in 10th class tuition, there was a time when I got typhoid and didn't came to class for like 2 weeks and it was the time when the rest of the students decided to plan a farewell party at the end of the session in a club/lounge and decided to keep it a secret from the teachers. After almost 13 days later, When I went back, everyone single student/my friends were staring at me and said ""you didn't do it right/you shouldn't have done something like this"" and no one told me what it was, not my best friend who was the closest to me for 13 years, not my ex best friend (the one I asked out), not even the boys I used to hang out with. Then only 1 girl came secretly and said that you told all the teachers about all our plans and now they have strictly cancelled it and told our parents about it. Well.....yea..... That came in as a clear shock to me coz off course I had typhoid and I didn't even attended 13 days of classes so how? or maybe why? But no one listened and she even said that when we asked for proof from the teachers coz even the students didn't expected that I would do something like this, they said (the teachers) I told them about it and even made the students hear a recording in which the voice sounded like me telling the teachers about the plan even though my phone was switched off for those 2 weeks coz I was weak afk due to the typhoid but yea who's gonna believe me, right?

Then there was a day long lost friend who once lived right beside my house was shifted when we were kids and we met for the first time in years in 10th class tuition. Us and 1 more friend in the neighbourhood were one of the best trios of friends out in the society, the 3rd friend still lived in the neighbourhood then one day I get a call by this long lost friend and the ex best friend (the one I asked out) to come meet them as it's urgent and the 3rd trio guy (who was still living in the neighbourhood) was also there for some reason and they said you must be happy to spread such a rumour that ""I"" and my ""ex best friend"" are dating again and I was like what??? The trio guy told them that I told him about it and the rumours were now spreading. I was like hold up, I didn't even say anything so wtf is going on but who's gonna believe me after the ""party cancellation incident"", right?

So the girl who was my best friend for 13 years was actually the one who I've always loved deep down at the bottom of my heart but off course I can't show that, can I? :) , there were times when I used to write her text message saying you look cute and I wanna talk to u about something but whenever she asked ""what?"",  I would say ""nothing really"". Then there was a time when I did the same and her replies obviously got a lot shorter and a lil meaner than before and when I said you have changed she said that everyone is busy now in their lives and so please if you wanna say something or meet me don't do either of them coz her mother has said so that she shouldn't talk to me now and also said the same for herself too that she never want to see me or talk to me and further everything ended after me saying that ""I will never message you ever again"". In addition, this incident grew inside me into a hatred of me towards her even though I've always cared about her but out of nowhere she said something like this and her mother said the same (even though she has treated me like a son) and that was the exact time when I failed in 11th class. So yeah.....



\----------PHASE 3----------

Furthermore, in 11th class,  I had to go for open schooling and start studying 12th class directly coz i didn't wanted to be 1 year shorter than my old school friends.

In 12th class (open schooling) I met a girl who I really liked (maybe coz I wanted to get over my best friend? or maybe I actually just liked her truly), I just liked her a lot and I could tell that no other boy was hitting on her. There, I was sitting with my newly made great friend and I whispered to him that I think she's really cute and that a\*s xD called the girl and said that I wanted to say something so I said it... with a very flat face that I liked her and further down the road after a few weeks, we had close moments like sitting on the same desks while studying holding each other hands, sometimes she would put her hands on my lap and stuff like that. Then one day a guy proposed to her and asked her out but she rejected him, so next day I got her a chocolate and said its for you and nothing else and she accepted it. However, there was a time when the year session was coming to an end, we were having physical fitness test and I was on the track running when I saw her talking to a boy alone under shed of a tree and it wasn't the first time I saw her like that, still, she asked a lot of why I was behaving weirdly but I brushed it all out and said its nothing and when we were close and sitting next to each other. And then in a close moment when we almost kissed,  I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she said that she was confused between me and her best friend (who lived near her house) coz he likes her too and she didn't wanna break his heart. Well... guess what? I was shattered.  :)  Then when I thought everything was already getting over with, I failed in chemistry exams and had to retake the exam. (Even though many people might think that it's alright retaking an exam, it wasn't. It definitely wasn't coz I studied hard and didn't achieved the result I wanted.)

  
\----------PHASE 4----------

Furthermore I, then tried applying to most of the colleges for engineering in India but got rejected due to extremely high cut-off marks/percentage requirements so I came with a plan about going to Canada to study bachelor's. So I went to a study abroad sort of agency (trusted by many of my father's friends) and they got me my offer letter but my visa got rejected and through an outsource I got to know that the agency didn't file a proper documentation and didn't include any salary slips of my dad or anything else that shows the funds (my friends still to this day says that it wasn't because of the funding thing but because I'm a science student and I was applying for Graphics Designer course) and then a month later they applied again to the same college and course, well.....it got rejected again whereas 2 of my friends who have been to the same school with me for years got accepted and went on to study there. (Even though, both of them have returned after 2 years due to the lack of jobs). 

So my mom's brother told me about the stock market and how it works. Now, it's been 2 years since I've started and I've bought my father a phone, a phone for myself, an A/C for my room, my own study desk and chair, a gaming laptop all it's accessories, my own motorcycle and much more and I've also suffered a loss of 1.5L which I've almost recovered due to revenge trading that was a mistake on my part and i know it. I'm in my 3rd year of my BCA-OL degree from IGNOU due to my not so great marks in 12th class (63%), I didn't got into great/good colleges so I had to do something. 

I've currently made an AI chatbot, a Game using java and 2 applications that are basically utilities type for android and desktop like app blocker and more and I'm further planning to study in Germany for my masters degree but again I ain't great in theoretical exams so I'm scared and plus I'm learning German to attend the DSH exam for the same and the IELTS exam. There have been on and off questions about in my mind of if I'll me able to go abroad to study and how am I going to perform in my exams for the final year and everything.

  
(EVEN THOUGH, MANY WILL LAUGH IT OFF BUT I HAVE A ONE AND ONLY DREAM SINCE MY CHILDHOOD OF OWNING A LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR LP700-4 COZ I'M A HUGEEE CAR ENTHUSIAST THAT HAS MOTIVATED ME TO OVERCOME ALL THE OBSTACLES TILL DATE)

  
\----------PHASE 5----------

Now another thing is that the 13 year old ""best"" friend (the one who told me to never text her again and her mother said the same) has now once again stepped into my life indirectly. My mom used to teach her since nursery so off course they are still in a student and teacher relationship and the fight was between me and her/her mother and not my mother and her so she, last year, asked my mom if we had any plans for Diwali festival coz her family too didn't had any plans so she asked my mom and my mom said no she didn't had any plans and so a dinner in their house was finalized but yes, I said ""No, I will not go"". My mom gave them an excuse and so my mom and dad were the ones who had dinner. It wasn't the first time their family had asked our family for something as simple as a dinner like this, their have been times when both the families wanted to go to temple/to café and much more and every time I had to give excuses for like 8-9 months and her dad always said 1 thing, why don't you ever bring him(me) and even her mother has insisted from the very beginning for the same. 

Further, after Diwali was over, a day later, my mom said ""it doesn't look nice that you are avoiding them in the face even though they have been so persistent to ask about me, so please lets go for 15 mins for a cup of tea and chat to their house and then we'll return"". I went there and surprisingly her dad and mom was delighted to see me and said ""finally the businessman had time off from the meetings xD"" in a laughing gesture and she (the best friend) was there too and she has a sister too who is smaller than her in age who also used to study under my mom. Then there was my dad's birthday and her mom's birthday on the same day so they asked for me specifically again so I had to join them to a restaurant to celebrate the 2 birthdays, where for the first time in  5 years probably, I talked to her about what she has been doing and all that (if I'm gonna be honest, yes I hated her a lot like I just don't want to see her face ever again but deep down my other side has actually loved and cared for her) so we talked normally and then I talked to her lil sis of what she has been doing and off course now I ain't that boy who would just show how he feels in public coz my heart has been shattered a lot of times and my humour of making jokes has been off the roof for a few months including dark comedy etc that helps me keep everything together which is why I, unintendedly,  was making everyone laugh at the restaurant and after the dinner she said let's take a picture together which in the 13 years she has never asked me and I felt odd and awkward but alright let's go for a pic. Then, on the new year they came to our house for new year celebration and had dinner where almost the same things happened.

Additionally, I guess in February,  another dinner happened at our house where I partially made the dinner too this time coz I have recently enjoyed making small portions of food (International and Indian cuisines) and served them and then I talked to her father in a simple conversation about study stuff and what's been happening and then my mom insisted me to make coffee (as my hands are just too great :) at making coffee) so I made her dad, mom and her sis some coffee and then she too asked for a coffee and the sugar was less in our house but still when I made it and she drank, it was bitter and she said ""there's no sugar in this xD"" in a laughing gesture and her mom said ""I see you are taking a lot of revenge for the coffee"" laughingly and I said ""No, the sugar was not there but give the coffee, ill make it  better again and all"" and yea we went to the kitchen and till the time she was fixing her coffee herself and I was helping with her, (back when we were close friends, I used to touch her nose to annoy her a bit so I did that reflexively and she didn't mind and touched and played with her hair and all a bit more and yea that was a simplified version of how the night ended.

So now the Holi festival came and my mom said that she and her sister will be coming to celebrate Holi coz I haven't celebrated Holi in years coz all my friends from the society shifted far away and have never even met in years so they came and her parents too though my dad wasn't home as he was still working so she came and said happy Holi rubbing colours on my face but I didn't (I don't know why but I thought it might be awkward for me to rub colour on her face too) so we served some snacks to her and we all talked together and for some reason me and her mom have made a funny bond to roast my mom/dad in a laughing gesture so we had fun and all and then we went to one of my moms friend coz she too doesn't celebrate a lot and she has always loved meeee like she has said so many times if she had a daughter (she has a son) she would have made me marry her daughter instantly without a second thought and when I met her she said the same in front of her, her mother and her sister. Her mom has also teased me into saying so many times that you're wife would be very satisfied and happy coz you know how to cook and I said nahh I ain't gonna marry, I can't sustain myself on my own so how am I supposed to satisfy her jokingly so it all ended and she insisted on taking a picture with me again and rubbing colours all over my bike :) and the day ended.

(This happened this week) Now 2 days before a trip was planned to a temple that was 7-8 hours away with her family of 4 and my family and we went and took a stop after a few hours for breakfast where we both chatted again and had a conversation with her mother and father both and surprisingly my father and she were a huge fan of tea which they chatted over and then I went outside to wash hands and took a selfie and she was behind me and I asked if she wanted to come in the frame and she said yes and then our parents were still inside so we got in her car, she was in the driver seat, I was in the rear seat with her sister there too and talked a bit and then I annoyed her by messing/playing with her hair a bit and then somewhat somehow it was a great trip overall. We saw some puppies there at the hotel with whom we played a lot and yea it was nice trip overall.

Now, in the trip, her mother said that they were going to shift somewhere to leave the current area they live in (she first used to live right next door and then shifted a km or two away where they are currently living and prefer to shift afar more coz they don't really like the area). But yeah that's it... I have no clue why am I typing all this or what am I expecting here but this is it.  :)",1,1743174277.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

The house in front is a jigsaw, three sections stitched together like some drunk architect's fever dream. Bottom bit, rough-cut stone, grey and jagged. All chunks and angles. Steps up to a front door that looks like a black maw, yawning in the red brick, and the roof is a mess, sloping down, red brick again, except where they'd chucked in some light grey, like they ran out of money mid-project.

I am booked in for this ""alternative support coaching"", something about well-being, but I don't really give a toss. Only thing matters is the coach herself. Been doing this for a while. Coaches, therapists, healers, the whole lot, advertised online. If the face was a right piece, I signed up. Pretended I needed therapy, but the real game was to nick a shag. Worked, sometimes. One in ten, maybe. Other times, it was a close call with the police, a death threat, a restraining order (just once, mind), or at least a slap in the face. Overall, it was worth it.

Click, the door swings open. There she is, late thirties, maybe early forties. She has a spark. Slim, but with curves. Auburn hair, long and tangled, some strands falling over her forehead. Eyes the colour of blue sapphire, relaxed, and a smile that could melt a glacier. Chunky knit sweater, light grey, over skin-tight red leggings. My cock stiffens.

""Hi, you must be Steve?"" she says, her voice smooth like honey.

""Hi. Steven"" I correct, trying to keep my gaze locked on her face.

""Jessica,"" she offers her hand, a firm grip. ""Come in, please.""

The living room is dominated by a suede monster of a couch, brown and worn. Cushions scattered, pinks and blues and grays. Coffee table holds court in the center, piled high with books, a bowl of something that might've been fruit, and a ball of yarn? Messy chaos. The daylight bleeds through the blinds, bruised, filtered. Across the room, a large window looks out on a garden. Child's drawings, colored in, faded, were pinned there. In the garden, a swing and trampoline, choked by dirt, grass, and moss.

Peculiar, this, having clients in her own living room. And no attempt at tidying up. But for me, although I like neat and tidy, it didn't really matter. Only the potential shag, and she was every bit as good as her online pic, even better in the flesh.

Still, the mess gnawed. Was it just a reflection of Jessica's chaotic personality, or something else? I say I don't care, but it pricks at me. I see her watching me looking at the room.

""Sit down, please"" she says.

I do, and she sits opposite.

""The other person will be joining us shortly.""

Other person? What other? ""Sorry, did you say 'other person'? Another coach?""

She smiles, that smile again. ""No, not another coach. Another client. It's a session in a support group format."" Puzzled, she adds, ""You did know that, didn't you? The ad I put up?""

Damn it. I swallow, feeling uneasy. ""Yes, of course..."" I lie.

She looks at me, sizing me up. Seeing through the bullshit? After a few seconds, I ask, ""So, you've been doing this support thing for a long time?"" Small talk, to ease the tension.

""Not that long.""

Then, car tires on gravel. Jessica stands up, ""I think he's here.""

He?

""We'll be three for this session,"" she sings, heading for the door.

Three. Not what I had in mind. While waiting I started looking through the stack of books on the table. *The Velveteen Rabbit. The Lorax. Les Malheurs de Sophie.* French. Fancy.

""Hi Paul,"" I hear Jessica chirping from the hallway.

""Hi Jess,"" the man grunts back. They lumber into the living room, him a middle-aged bloke, pushing fifty, face like a bulldog. Built like a squat, brick-shit-house, belly like a well-worn leather duffel bag overflowing. Full, grizzled beard. The hair on top receding.

""Steven, this is Paul. Paul, Steven,"" Jessica makes the introductions. Paul nods and settles down, looking pissed someone else is hogging the couch. This fat bastard ain't no player., He's here for this self-improvement bollocks, maybe to shed a few pounds. Many pounds.

Jessica is again on the chair in front of us, while we're on the couch. ""Anyone fancy a coffee before we kick things off?"" she asks. I say thanks. Paul just shakes his head.

""Alright then, Steve, let's hear it. Why are you here?"" Jessica probes.

""Hmm,"" I mumble, my rehearsed spiel ready to roll off the tongue. ""I'm here to be better,"" I start, ""Last year was hell. Lost my job, split from a long-term relationship..."" I give her the sheepish eyes, the heart-wrenching act. ""It wasn't easy. And let's just say my well-being's been in the gutter since."" I try to force a tear, but it ain't the same with this other bloke in the room, I catch him looking at me like I'm a shite specimen under a microscope, pure disgust in his eyes.

Jessica, though, she's all sympathetic nods and understanding glances. ""Paul, your turn,"" she says.

""Well,"" Paul begins, solemn as a funeral director, ""I too had a romantic implosion. Hard times. Wasn't it, Jess?"" And at that, I see Jessica flush, a right blush creeping up her neck. What the fuck's going on here?

""Hold on a minute,"" Jessica interrupts, ""For Steven's sake, I need to clarify something. Paul and I...used to be together.""

What? Her and that fat, ancient relic? Dating? Was she into some kind of morbid fetish?

""Sorry,"" Paul mumbles.

""No, I had to be straight with Steven,"" Jessica spits, cheeks brighter than a sunrise now. ""Steven, sorry if this is weird for you. You can leave if you feel uncomfortable. I planned this session as a group, see?""

""Why's he here, then? Why not find another shrink?""

Before Paul could even open his gob, Jessica's in, ""I decided it could be a good way to sort out all issues together. Experimental. So... Stay or leave?""

I sized up the situation, looked at Paul, contrite, not the arrogant prick of a few minutes ago. ""I'll stay,"" I growled, ""but it's weird. I feel tricked, in a way. And never thought you too could have been together.""

Jessica's face, already beetroot red, went even darker. Paul shoots me a look. I hold his gaze, no flinching. ""Because of how I look, yeah? Think we split because I'm old and round at the middle?""

And probably your dick's gone soft too, I think, but keep it to myself. ""No... or maybe yes,"" I blurt, honest for once.

""It's not like that,"" Jessica jumps in.

""We've had our problems,"" Paul mumbles, eyes fixed on Jessica. She's looking back, all intense, pushing him to talk more.

""Right, from the start then,"" Paul says, ""We met in 2016.""

""2015"" Jessica corrects.

""2015 yeah, sure. But not official then.""

""Hold on,"" I interject, feeling like they're using me as a shrink in this show. ""It feels like I'm the one doing therapy for you both, is it? ""

""It's not really therapy,"" Jessica interjects, ""Not in the classical sense. Joint coaching, like. We're all therapist and patient, rolled into one.""

""Right, sorry for the interruption,"" I mutter, backpedaling.

Paul continues, ""I was married. Miserable. Mid-life crisis too, probably.""

Jessica arches an eyebrow, but keeps her mouth shut. Paul goes on, ""Jessica, she waltzed into my life like a lifeline. I was drowning, and she hauled me back. Saved me.""

""I was sinking too. Stuck with an abusive drunk,"" Jessica adds, ""Paul, he was a breath of fresh air, gentle, loving. Swept me off my feet.""

""So, Paul, you were... lighter then, fitter?"" I throw in, sarcastic. Both of them glare at me like I've just pissed on their grannies' graves.

Paul ignores my remark and presses on, ""Never loved anyone like I loved you, Jess,"" he swallows hard, ""Thought if I died right then, it wouldn't matter. Life had achieved its purpose, being with you, even for a blink.""

Jessica's eyes are welling up. I'm feeling a prickle of unease.

Paul continues, ""Then we took the plunge, hard but needed. Divorced the exes, and Jess and I, we were together. Happiest days of my life.""

Jessica nods. ""Free, in love, traveling the globe, feeling young again. Happy again.""

""Then Sophie came along,"" Paul adds, voice heavy with emotions.

""Sophie? Kinky!"" I crack a wry smile, ""Menage a trois to spice things up?""

""Sophie, our daughter!"" Jessica snaps, her voice sharp as a whip.

""Oh,"" I stammer, feeling sheepish.

""Sophie, best thing that ever happened to me, best thing in my life,"" Paul says through tears. Jessica's face is a waterfall of grief too now.

I don't need more, the pieces are clicking into place, a grim jigsaw puzzle. My gut's churning, sweat prickling on my skin.

""Cannot tell the details, the image... raw, still raw after three years. Never heal, never fade..."" Paul chokes out, sobs wracking his body now.

""I... you don't..."" I manage, my own throat tight.

""Sophie... she's gone,"" Jessica blurts, tears streaming down her face. ""My baby gone. An angel.""

Christ, that hit me harder than a right hook. Silence descends, suffocating. Sniffles from Paul and Jessica, the only sounds in the room. I want to bolt, but can't bring myself to leave them in their misery. Strange, how the thought of shagging Jessica evaporated, replaced by a gut wrenching empathy, sharing their pain like a communion.

""Hard to live with, that... drifted apart,"" Paul confesses after the long, painful silence, shame hanging heavy. ""Looking at Jess, it was like looking at Sophie. Couldn't... tried to find comfort elsewhere.""

When they seem deep in their thoughts, I stand up, ready to bail. This ain't the gig I signed up for. I glance back at them. Two wrecked souls. Jessica, the chirpy woman from half an hour ago, now eyes red raw. And Paul, I probably hammered him too hard. I didn't twig he was lugging around a whole suitcase of grief.

I'm halfway to the door, when Jessica notices me, she shrugs. I stop, take a lungful, and go back on the couch.

""Listen, I'm... sorry? Don't really know what to say..."" I mumble. Silence rolls back in.

""So, what now, then?"" I ask. ""You want to be back together?""

""No, not like before,"" says Jessica, ""We've shared love and pain. We want to be happy, at peace.""

Paul nods, a glimmer of something in his eyes, hope maybe ""Peace, that's what I crave. Celebrate my little Sophie, keep her memory burning bright till the end. Won't be happy again.""

The silence stretched again,. I felt the need to say something. ""A mate of mine, his son died, twenty-five, twenty-six, in some peacekeeping mission abroad. Left the poor man and his wife a wreck. Not the same for years. I thought he'd be fucked, permanently. But time, time's a healer, as they say. He found some semblance of normal, eventually.""

Jessica and Paul are listening. ""Not the same, I know,"" I say but Paul cuts in, ""Loss of a child, it's devastating, no matter the age. Twenty-six, that's young.""

I feel some of satisfaction at my small contribution. Then Jessica pipes up, ""I tried to start again, when Paul left. Wanted to leave this place, head downtown, some small flat, like back in my student days. Pretend none of this ever happened. But I couldn't."" She pauses, a beat. ""This house, it binds me to Sophie. Her laughter, I hear it echoing. See her flitting through the rooms, in my head. Every morning, I wake up expecting her to jump in my bed, like she used to. Still today. Every day."" A wistful smile, eyes scan the room, ""Even this clutter, this mess, I keep it like it was when she was here. Can't bring myself to move on. I don't want to.""

My eyes, they're welling up. Fuck it. What is happening to me? Am I turning into a softie? I force the tears back, down, down, gotta keep them bottled up.

Nobody says anything for another long while. Then Jessica seems to be pulling herself together. A hint of a smile creeping back on her face. The sadness is still there underneath.

""But it's not just us, Steven,"" she says, looking at me softly, ""What about you? What do you expect from these sessions?"" She pauses, ""now that you've decided to stick it out.""

I take my time, thinking. They are waiting, expectant. I feel their eyes bore into me. I came here for some action, but it is shifting. Jessica and Paul, raw and exposed, feels like a minefield. While I am still struggling with the thought of being a part of this, here I am, knee-deep already.

Paul and Jessica's pain is real. Their grief is real. The memories of their love and happiness are real. The enduring love for their daughter is real. The moments they held her in their arms, kissed her cheek, basked in the glow of her smile, all real. The constant ache in the space beside them is real. What did I have? Nothing. No real love. No real life. Just chasing the next high. A hollow echo. Is that a life worth living? ""I want to find peace... and love. I want love. And to live. A genuine life."" the words tumble out, surprising even myself. Like some other voice has taken over, some deeper, more thoughtful part of me.",2,1743174192.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1jlx2b6,https://i.redd.it/8lzyu9v93gre1.jpeg,She’s here!,"Received our Jura Z10 about a month ago and have been loving it! Feeling like we have our favorite drinks dialed in now. I changed the filter and ran a cleaning cycle right around the 1 month mark with averaging 3-6 coffees a day. 

I love my milk based drinks so I got the cool control milk cooler. I do not leave it on all night long as the manual suggests not to. It’s very simple to take the milk out and put in the fridge when I do a milk cleaning at the end of the day. 

I will say it goes through A LOT of water with all the rinse cycles. I fill it every 1.5 days which is more than I was used to coming from a nespresso vertuo machine. 

I purchased in the USA from abt.com during their family sale so the machine ended up costing $3,069 and the 1L cooler being $319. (Chat with a sales person to get extra $$ off) We have a relative in Europe that regularly sends packages so we’ve asked them to add milk cleaning tablets and filters to the bimonthly package because they are half the price!

I was hoping to find an answer to something I can’t explain myself. I just opened a bag of Diego Bermudez Geisha and tried it out and was blown away by the thick and creamy mouthfeel of the coffee. I can’t logically explain how this can happen using a ZP6 that reduces fines which would make up the body. I’ve had this happen twice with very high quality Geishas. Do you know how this happens. Both were washed and the Bermudez one was creamier and had lactobacillus fermentation. 

Another thing that astounded me was the colour of the Bermudez coffee which was said to be lightly roasted, tasted and smelled like one but has a very dark colour. Why could that be?

Thank you in advance for the help!",3,1743173853.0,pourover,1,1.0,False
1jlx017,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1jlx017/one_thing_i_wish_teacher_knew/,One thing I wish teacher knew,"Elaine was a good teacher, but like *anyone* surrounded by children all week, she looked forward to the weekend.

As such, she liked to keep Fridays simple. Typically, they ended the day with *“One thing I wish my teacher knew…”* cards.

Usually, this involved a lot of wish fulfillment.

*I wish I could fly so I get home fast.*

*I wish every pen was sparkly.*

Sometimes, though, Elaine might glean something that helped support the kids better.

*I wish Miss knew…my hamster was sick.*

*…that my dad is gone for ages (6 weeks).*

Today, however, it was Tommy’s card that concerned her most.

*If I go like my sister and don’t come in on Monday, find container 31.*

By all accounts, Tommy’s sister was a model student, but Tommy was…*tricky.* He was that scruffy kid who couldn’t sit still for five minutes. But of late, there was an anger in him that Elaine couldn’t reconcile…

After school, she took Tommy’s card to the Principal.

“Don’t worry, Elaine,” Principal Hoffe assured her. “I’ll call home right now… Wait here if you like.”

Tommy’s parents answered. Everything seemed fine.

“We’ll see Tommy Monday morning, then… Thanks, bye now…” the Principal smiled as he hung up.

“I’m sure it’s nothing,” he sympathised. “Enjoy your weekend, Elaine.”

But something just felt…*off.*

Elaine left with a knot in the pit of her stomach.

\*

After worrying all weekend, Elaine was dreading Monday morning - but her fears were quickly allayed when she saw Tommy sat at his little desk.

The other kids were messing around, but not Tommy.

“Morning,” Elaine smiled. She felt *so* relieved.

“Morning Miss.”

“Good weekend?”

Tommy nodded pleasantly…

This carried on all week.

By Wednesday, Elaine was starting to feel a little unnerved. Tommy was so…*different.*

He just *sat there*, attentively. Good as gold.

It was like he was there…but also *wasn’t*.

She tried to explain this to the Principal, but she sounded crazy.

“We rang home,” he stated bluntly, “that’s our duty of care.”

Then, on Thursday, Elaine was invited to dinner at Tommy’s house. *That Friday.*

Something wasn't right.

As a last resort, she went to the Police station downtown. The booking officer was very understanding.

“Look,” he assured Elaine after taking her details, “if I get chance, I’ll check this container out myself, promise.”

Friday - the day of the meal - passed by in a blur.

She felt sick on the drive over. *Nervy.*

“Welcome,” Tommy’s mother smiled. “Please, come in.”

Everyone was very pleasant. The food smelt lovely.

After a coffee they sat down to dinner - but then Elaine’s phone rang.

It was the officer.

“Excuse me…” Elaine apologised. She took the call in the kitchen.

“Miss Elaine?” the officer asked, “I’m at the docks - at container 31.”

Elaine’s blood ran cold.

“There’re four bodies in here,” the officer continued, “…two adults and…*two children.*”

Terrified, Elaine turned round. The family were all smiling at her.",53,1743173838.0,shortscarystories,4,0.99,False

I started concerta 27mg  almost 3 weeks ago. 1st adhd medication ever. I read some tips and tricks with taking the medication, to make sure I don't get the jitters as I did the first few days on it. 

My morning routine before work, includes a cup of coffee and my meds, then about 2 hours into work I have breakfast. I think I wasn't drinking enough water for this set up, and started looking here for some tips on how to take this medication best. 

I read here about taking protein with concerta, so I did that the last 10 days or so. And while I didn't get the jitters like I did with just coffee and not enough water, I also felt like I wasn't taking it at all. Today, I did my coffee and concerta, followed by protein about 30 mins after. And this is the deal right here. I feel loads better. 

Anyone have any stories they can share about how they take their dose, particularly with protein, in terms of a time frame? ",1,1743173650.0,Concerta,3,1.0,False

1jlwwpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jlwwpn/no_more/,No More,"It began on a Tuesday morning. Adam swiped his credit card at the coffee shop, as he had done every day for the past five years. But this time, the machine beeped with an error message: *Transaction declined.*

He thought it was a mistake, so he tried again. Same result. 

""Sorry, sir,"" the barista said, glancing at him with an awkward smile. ""Your card’s not working.""

""That’s impossible,"" Adam muttered, pulling out his debit card and trying it instead. But when he entered his pin, the machine froze before flashing the same error. *Transaction declined.*

He pulled out his phone, opened the bank app, and tried to check his balance. But the app wouldn't load. He closed it and reopened it. Nothing. The screen went blank.

Strange. He figured it was just a glitch and walked out, trying not to overthink it. But the next day, when he tried to log in to pay a bill, the same thing happened. No access to his accounts. The website couldn’t find him. He called his bank, but the automated voice didn’t recognize his account information.

""Sorry, the number you’ve dialed is no longer in service,"" the voice said.

It was only then that Adam started to feel something creeping at the edge of his mind, something deeply unsettling.

The following day, he went to his employer's office to finish some work. He swiped his ID card at the entrance, expecting the usual click. Instead, the door didn’t open. He tried again. Nothing. 

He stepped up to the security desk, feeling a knot form in his stomach. “I’m Adam Bishop. I’m on the schedule today.”

The guard raised an eyebrow. “What’s your employee ID number?” 

“6578921.” Adam replied. 
The security guard typed it in. ""I’m sorry, but there's no one by that name on the list.""

Adam felt a cold rush flood through his chest. Adam stammered, trying to explain, but the more he talked, the more the security guard's expression hardened, as if Adam wasn’t making any sense at all.

He left in a daze, and as he drove home, he tried calling his best friend, Luke. He’d known Luke for nearly twenty years—had shared apartments with him, birthdays, holidays. Luke would know who he was. But when the phone rang, it just went to voicemail. He called again. And again.

No answer.

That evening, Adam went over to Luke’s apartment. He knocked, waited a moment, and then knocked again. The door opened.

""Can I help you?"" the man asked.

“Luke? It’s Adam,” he said, frustration creeping into his voice. “Luke, where have you been? We’ve known each other forever.”

The man looked at him blankly. “I’m sorry, you must be at the wrong house.”

Adam felt his world collapse in on itself. He tried to explain, but the man just shook his head, eyes darting to the side, clearly uncomfortable.

Adam left, feeling the weight of something suffocating his chest. Something was wrong. Something was so wrong, he could hardly breathe.

He went home, hoping things would return to normal. His wife, Sarah, was in the kitchen making dinner, humming softly to herself. Adam leaned against the doorway, watching her.

“Hey, Sarah,” he said softly. “How was your day?”

She didn’t respond right away. She continued chopping vegetables. He cleared his throat and said it again, louder this time. “Sarah? It’s me. Adam.”

She stopped, slowly turned, and blinked. Her expression was blank, like she didn’t recognize him at all. She tilted her head, still holding the knife in her hand.

“Who are you?” she asked. “Get out of my house! I’m gonna call the cops!” She screamed

Adam’s stomach churned, his vision narrowing. “What do you mean? It’s *me*, Adam. Your husband. We’ve been together for years.”

But Sarah just stared at him, her eyes empty, her face cold. “LEAVE! NOW!”

His heart pounded. He tried again, his voice shaking. “Sarah, please—this isn’t funny. I’m *Adam*.” He grabbed her arm, but she raised the knife at him. 

He stumbled back, disoriented. His mind raced, and everything around him felt like it was shifting, blurring. He ran to his kids’ room, but when he opened the door, his son and daughter were crying. 

“Go away!” The oldest boy screamed 
“Mommy!!!” His daughter yelled. 

Sarah ran in with the knife “GET OUT NOW!”


The world spun as Adam tried to process what was happening. He ran out of the house. He grabbed his phone again, shaking hands dialing his parents’ number. His mother answered, but when he said, “Mom, it’s me, Adam,” her voice cracked with confusion.

“Adam who? I’m sorry, but I don’t think I know you,” she said. There was no recognition in her tone, just an uncomfortable distance.

“But—Mom, it’s me, your son!” His throat was tight with panic, but she just kept repeating that she didn’t know him. His father, when he tried calling him, echoed the same thing: ""You’re not my son.""

Adam didn’t know how to breathe anymore. He was suffocating in the confusion, in the horror of it all. His family, his friends, everyone he knew—*no one recognized him.*

He wasn’t dead. He wasn’t alive. So, he drifted through the streets, past people who walked right through him, past places that no longer held his name. The man he had been—the person who had lived and laughed and loved—was gone, slowly slipping out of existence. And no one even noticed.",7,1743173593.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1jlwtpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/fearofflying/comments/1jlwtpd/i_might_have_found_a_way_back_to_not_being_afraid/,I might have found a way back to not being afraid of flying (+ tips),"Hi! I’ve posted on this sub before, and for the past two years, I’ve spent hours reading it before every flight. But it wasn’t always like this. Until a couple of years ago, I wasn’t afraid of flying. In fact, I was excited about it. I believe my newfound fear is linked to the overall stress level in my life.

I’ve always wondered - what would it feel like to return to my past self? Is it even possible? I continued flying multiple times per year out of necessity, but it was always incredibly stressful and filled with self-imposed rituals. I also found myself subconsciously avoiding flights, even if it meant choosing a less exciting vacation spot or taking a 15-hour train ride instead of a four-hour flight.

I worked with a therapist for a few months and kept asking her the same question: Do you think it’s possible for me to completely get rid of this fear?

And then it happened, totally unexpected. My boyfriend and I took a short trip to Lisbon and this time I simply didn’t have time to be afraid before the flight or to discuss it with my therapist. The flight went surprisingly well. My stress levels remained consistently low, and I even enjoyed it. Usually, my anxiety peaks just before boarding, but this time, it was just… Okay? I remember making cottage cheese pancakes for breakfast a few hours before the flight, fully present in the moment, even feeling a bit excited, thinking: “Wow, I’m in my kitchen now, but in just a few hours, I’ll be in Lisbon”.

I think this shift happened because eight years ago, Lisbon was my most exciting and farthest trip at the time. Somehow, I reconnected with that forgotten feeling of anticipation and adventure.

That being said, my fear hasn’t disappeared completely. Our return flight was during a storm, and I was shaking uncontrollably due to the turbulence. But something in my fear has changed. I booked the next flight recently with no hesitation.

I want to share some tips that really helped me, apart from traveling to an exciting destination:

1. A tip from my therapist: Write down your stress levels every 30 minutes on the day of the flight. You don’t have to do this every time. I did it just once and realised that my fear is highest before boarding and that I’m relatively calm during the flight itself. Now, I try to arrive at the airport as late as possible (but not so late that I start worrying about missing my flight).

1. Another tip from therapy: Connect flying to a fundamental value in your life. Most of my flights are connected to the value of seeing my family, and some - to the value of exploring the world.

1. Learn more about yourself. What calms you and what stresses you out? For example, I need to sleep well the night before the flight, eat properly, and wear comfortable clothes that make me feel cozy. I never drink coffee or alcohol before flying. I always bring a bottle of water and sour gummies because the sour taste helps distract me from anxiety.

1. My mantra: **Flying is the natural state of the plane.** This helped me overcome my fear of Boeings in particular. It doesn’t matter if it’s an Airbus, a Boeing, or even a Sukhoi Superjet - due to their aerodynamics, they are meant to be in the air. When I was anxious about my return flight from Lisbon, I watched seagulls gliding effortlessly over the waves, even in windy conditions. Flying is as natural for them as it is for airplanes.

I really wanted to share this “success” story because I know how it feels to not be able to imagine life without this fear. When I first read or heard advice like this, it seemed useless to me. I thought: Yeah SURE drinking enough water will help me cope with being inside a giant flying tin can”. But once these small habits became routine, once I got to know myself better, and once I found statements that truly resonated with me (""air is like jelly,"" ""it’s uncomfortable but not unsafe,"" etc.) and internalized them - it really made a difference.

Wishing everyone all the best!

Just found the podcast and have been binging it at work. Have a story I think you will enjoy from my time working labour.

I worked in a small shop (5 people) that was owned by a bigger company. (200+ on there shop floor) 

Durring our monthly health n safety meeting. H&S began to give us a hard time and start the crack down on “Near miss” forms. Little slips of paper we were supposed to fill out and put in a box. For things like “Dropped a screw off a ladder, power cord in floor was not flat could cause trip” because the bigger shop would have 50+ a month and we had 1-2. Honestly it was an only if the owner of our shop caught us and told us .

The hero of this story we will call “Lenny”

H&S : You guys need to fill this out for anything that could affect your work day! Home, travel to and from work and the work day ANYTHING that affects your day.

Lenny who was leaning back in his chair : “anytjing”

H&S: anything!

Lenny knods and goes back to leaning in his chair. 

After the meeting he looks at the big stack of post it note sized papers and takes over half and walks away.

The next meeting the box is PACKED and over flowing.

H&S pleased begins to read them out loud before sighing and looking to Lenny who crossed his arms shrugged and went 
“You said anything”

The issue was dropped immediately, over lunch the entire office and shop team sat around reading the forms and dying with laughter. Here are the highlights 

1. “Left boots out of the cubby. Fear wife may kill me!
2. Bagel was a bit burnt from Tim Hortons. I ate it but wasn’t happy about it.
3. Double knotted my shoe to tight, distracting me until I fixed it.
4. “Parked car in garage. Wife came home with groceries and was upset she couldn’t park in the garage. Fear for my life”
5. My in laws are in town and I made a joke that didn’t go well. Wife may kill
Me.
6. Forgot to hit start on the laundry before leaving. Wife may kill me.
7. Sock hit the floor instead of the hamper. Wife glared at me. May die 
8. Coffee got cold now I am sad 
9. Somone farted in the lunch room. 
10. OP sneezed and startled me. I almost dropped my sandwich.

Hope this can give somone a laugh today. ",6,1743173200.0,redditonwiki,0,1.0,False

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s tgats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair.

I did titration under Dr J and colleagues. They tried to put me up to 30mg but I felt like I was going to have a heart attack so went back down to 20mg at 9am with a 5mg methylphenidate instant release top up at 1pm. 

I’ve always had significant side effects:
• diarrhoea an hour after taking, then a few more times throughout the day. 

• freezing cold hands and feet 

• so jittery, heart feels like it’s pounding hard in my chest

• jaw clenching so bad

• I get very easily hyperfixated on something and it’s hard to switch tasks more so on the meds. 

• sex headaches

• I feel like I’m coked up after taking it 😅

• I don’t drink coffee, but if I treat myself to a Pepsi max I feel like I’m off my head and start shaking so badly. Even decaf coffee makes this happen! That must be a placebo effect. 

It’s also important to add that I’ve always had a very fast heart rate. It was around 98-115 resting before I was put on bisoprolol. Now it is 75-80 resting. 
I am a big girl, I am a size 20 at only 5’1. So I know my heart is going to get faster when doing anything at all. But I feel like the meds make it feel super fast even when it’s not. 
I’m also autistic aswell and have really bad health anxiety so feel like I feel side effects more intensely. 

I have spoken to Dr J and colleagues about all of these side effects and every time they assure me they’re normal and told me to wait until I’m settled on it then they’ll stop. Well it hasn’t stopped and it’s been nearly a year. 
I’m wondering if this means that Methylphenidate isn’t the medication for me.  
I do feel like it’s helped me get stuff done, but if I take it and then sit down and open TikTok or research something I like I cannot get anything done because I get completely stuck on what I’m doing. 
I don’t like how it makes me feel but DrJ is impossible to get through to so I’m going to speak to my GP as I have a shared care agreement.

I am sorry..,"I am sorry because I was not sure what was happening until I started to walk away. I needed to process the question. I was also running late for my Friday morning meeting…a lot was going on in my head. 

Here is what happened dear Reddit reader.

Tall, good looking man with beard, stopped walking towards me to ask if there were any coffee shops near by. 

I said a street over. And continued to walk, moving past him. He commented that I was waking fast, I nodded. Maybe I smiled? I don’t know remember. An involuntary smile with nod perhaps.

Then he said, “Do you want to have coffee with me?”

I turned around and said “No, I am fasting today and I am late.” It the last day of Ramazan and I was being reminded of coffee…as I was rehearsing my meeting talking points in my head. 

He chuckled and said “not today.”

I didn’t say anything and continued to walk and I walk FAST and as I did, I realized… until I crossed the street…that he was asking me out for coffee! 

Then I didn’t know what to do, cross the street and go back to talk him — but he had already turned his back and was walking away. 

So I let him walk away because it was not my turn to cross the street. 

I would have said yes if I had taken a minute to talk to him and get a better sense — looked him in his eyes! Or at least, I would have said “No, thank you.” 

The reason why I share this synopsis is that I was pleasantly surprised. It takes guts to approach a stranger and ask them out. I don’t want men to get discouraged. They should continue to respectfully ask women out in person. ",130,1743172566.0,washingtondc,36,0.85,False

1jlwg49,https://www.npmjs.com/package/super-retry,Meet Super-Retry - A Labor of Love for Resilient Apps ❤️,"Hi everyone,

I'm excited (and a bit nervous!) to share something I've been working on - Super-Retry, an open-source retry library for Node.js.

Why I Built This:
Last month, I struggled through countless API timeouts and transient errors while building distributed systems. Existing solutions either felt too rigid or required piecing together multiple libraries. I wanted something that:
🔹 Could grow with complex apps through middleware
🔹 Offered real observability out-of-the-box
🔹 Felt intuitive for both simple and advanced use cases

After days of late nights and coffee-fueled coding sessions, Super-Retry was born - and now I'd love your help to make it even better!

What Makes It Special:
✅ Flexible Strategies: From Fibonacci to AI-optimized backoffs
✅ Middleware System: Add logging, caching, or custom logic
✅ OpenTelemetry Ready: See retry attempts in your existing traces
✅ Zero Dependencies: Keep your bundle light

I'd Be Grateful If You Could:
👉 Try It: npm install super-retry
👉 Star the Repo: github.com/khizerarshad/super-retry
👉 Share Feedback: What's working? What's not?
👉 Contribute: Even docs improvements are appreciated!

This isn't ""yet another retry library"" - it's a community effort to solve real pain points we all face. Whether you're:
🔸 Tired of rewriting retry logic for every project
🔸 Struggling with LLM API rate limits
🔸 Managing unreliable IoT connections

...I'd love to hear how Super-Retry could help (or where it falls short).",0,1743172345.0,webdev,0,0.5,False

1jlwes8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1jlwes8/trip_review_kudadoo_in_maldives/,Trip Review: Kudadoo in Maldives,"Hi Travel Friends!

You all might remember me from our dumpster fire trip to Awasi. So, after that debacle, we really wanted a win. Our TA raves about her favorite place in the world: Kudadoo. Overwater villas, unlimited spa treatments (yes, unlimited!), and ocean excursions sounded like exactly what we needed, so we decided to spend a week there. Spoiler alert: u/sarahwlee was absolutely right. It's 100/10!  

# The Overview

We stayed for about a week this winter at about $5,000 per night including all service, tax and fees and with a discount from our TA. Kudadoo’s “Anything. Anytime. Anywhere.” philosophy means you’ll never see a bill for extras like picnics, diving, spa treatments, or champagne because it’s all included. 

# The Property

Kudadoo is an intimate, nearly adults-only\* private island with 15 overwater residences. The resort was designed by architect Yuji Yamazaki and is very eco-conscious. The island is fully solar-powered (I think the only one) and they do a weekly “earth day” to highlight sustainability which is super cool. And not just because it comes with special cupcakes as an after dinner treat. I digress. Anyway, all the design leans modern but is very comfortable and the spaces maximize the breathtaking views of the insanely turquoise ocean. Honestly, it is probably the first place I’ve been where the photos don’t do it justice. It’s even more stunning in person. I did take pictures though so if you want to see something let me know.

\*IMHO, this really isn’t a place for kids. There’s almost nothing for them to do, and no safety features along the walkways, pools, or off the decks. I personally wouldn’t bring littles here. On our last two nights, someone did and the kids were running wild while the parents yelled at them for snorkeling too far away (at one point they were under our villa). Honestly, it just reinforced my feeling that this isn’t a kid-friendly spot.

And because I don't know where else to put this—the only thing that isn’t perfect is the occasional smell of smoke if other guests decide to indulge. Whether you're on your deck or at the restaurant, the breeze makes it pretty obvious when someone’s lighting up, and there are ashtrays placed throughout the property. As a non-smoker (and someone who's very sensitive to it), I found it annoying. Not a dealbreaker, but definitely a little buzzkill in an otherwise flawless setting.

# The Villa

The One-Bedroom Ocean Pool Residences at Kudadoo are next-level. Each one is about 300 square meters and designed to blur the line between indoors and out. The outdoor deck was a total standout, with a 44m² infinity plunge pool (almost bigger than most NYC hotel rooms I’ve stayed in, lol) that quickly became my go-to spot. Most mornings we had breakfast out on the deck and watched sharks and turtles swim by while sipping banana iced coffee. Pro tip: that is the greatest coffee drink ever. But it was just as nice for taking a break between activities or for some gold hour canapés and champagne. 

While the deck is the star of the show, the indoor space more than holds its own. Inside, floor-to-ceiling glass doors open to uninterrupted ocean views, so you still get that open-air vibe with very welcome AC when you need it. The interiors are all clean lines and natural materials like wood, stone, and soft tones. It feels calming, serene, and still totally luxurious. The layout is wide open, with a spacious living area and a spa-like outdoor bathroom with a freestanding tub and rain shower. Also worth mentioning is the bed. I almost never call that out, but this one deserves it. It was ridiculously comfortable, and they went all out with options to customize your sleep experience. There is literally a multi-page menu of blankets, pillows, and even scents to help you sleep as well as possible. And everything comes in half sizes so if you want a different duvet than your partner that’s no problem. There are so many other thoughtful touches, like locally made toiletries, fresh-cut flowers in the room, and subtly luxurious linens. I honestly can't think of a single thing I’d change about the room except I do wish the hot water got hotter. I get that when it's hot AF outside, most people probably aren’t craving a warm bath, but it's part of my nightly ritual and just wasn’t doable here.

# Butler and Service

Said simply, Kudadoo nails relaxed elegance and delivers the best version of barefoot luxury I’ve ever experienced. You can easily go days without putting on shoes (not really because the deck boards get too hot but in spirit you can!), live in your swimsuit from sunrise to dinner, and still feel completely pampered at every turn. That’s largely thanks to the butler service, which is in a league of its own. 

Our butler was genuinely exceptional. He was warm, intuitive, and struck that perfect balance between being there when you need something and vanishing when you don't. When we were chatty, he'd join in. When I got sick and didn’t feel like leaving the room, he quietly gave us space but still made sure we were taken care of. It never felt scripted or stiff, just completely natural.

He was never more than a WhatsApp message away, and I’m pretty sure his average response time no matter the hour was about 10 seconds. No request ever felt too small or too over-the-top. Want a specific kind of fruit on your breakfast tray? Done. Craving a bottle of bubbles and a bowl of ice by the plunge pool every afternoon at 3? Absolutely. It's 9 p.m. and you suddenly decide an hour-long Balinese massage would help you sleep? The actual reply I got was, “Great idea, they’ll be there in ten minutes.” Want to switch from one dive to two that morning? No problem at all. Everything just… happens. 

This is both the greatest and worst thing that’s ever happened to me. I’m pretty sure no service will ever impress me again. I now refer to my husband as my back-up butler and get mildly depressed when I can’t just text someone for more coffee, a snack, or an emergency massage. They’ve truly created a monster.

The rest of the staff was equally warm, gracious, and on point. Despite the very high-end feel of the resort, there’s nothing pretentious about the service. Everyone is professional but friendly, polished but approachable. It’s clear the entire team operates like a well-oiled machine behind the scenes and it’s hard to describe how invisible the service feels. You don’t see people constantly running around, and yet everything is always exactly how and where it should be. We never once ran into housekeeping, yet somehow our room was refreshed multiple times a day. Laundry would disappear and then just reappear, perfectly folded or hanging back in the closet as if it had never left. It’s that kind of quiet, almost telepathic attentiveness that makes Kudadoo so hard to leave.

# Food and Beverage

Let’s talk about the food. The key takeaway is that I arrived weighing 112 pounds and left at 122. Yes you read that right and yes those are actual scale readings from the same scale. And no I didn't think it was physiologically possible either. But... I ATE AND DRANK EVERYTHING. And yes, I got super sick but only because I made objectively terrible choices. Everything was so freaking good, and I had major FOMO over the menu. I was apparently too dumb to realize that eating nothing but seafood from sunrise to sunset for four straight days might be a bad idea. Let’s just say DSP is real, I learned about it the hard way, and maybe pace yourself on the raw shellfish. Lesson learned.

That said, if you have questions about the food, I can answer them. Every single dessert? Had it. All 15+ flavors of ice cream and sorbet? Yep. Every ceviche, every tartare, the wagyu, the lobster, the truffle pizza. If it was on the 21-page breakfast menu or the 15-page all-day dining menu, I tried it. And then three nights a week, they roll out special themed dinners that are even more over-the-top. We got to experience yakitori night, tandoori night, and a South Asian-inspired tasting. 

The cheese cellar deserves its own paragraph. Calling it “insane” doesn’t do it justice. They will *never ever* forget your charcuterie order here. I tried to eat my way through it in a week and didn’t even come close. And I *really* tried. You can do a tasting of wine and cheese with the sommelier if you’re so inclined too. Speaking of… 

The included alcohol is high quality, too. You can request top-shelf options, and they’ll happily put something like a bottle of Lagavulin 16 in your villa. My husband thought this was a great idea, but since it makes him snore like a freight train, I had to veto it. Sorry, not sorry. But our sneaky butler – one day a bottle of Macallan 18 magically showed up on the minibar and who can say no to that?!? 

If you’ve read my other reviews, you’ll know I love a picnic or destination dining experience. This is one  spot where it just didn’t feel necessary because you can have a lot of privacy in the restaurant and the room service setup on the deck is perfect. So we tried them – dream island, the beach, the pool, and the jungle because see prior note on FOMO. But if I went back I’d skip them all, especially the jungle because it’s too hot and seemingly the only spot where there are mosquitoes. All that to say, every meal here can be as romantic or as casual as you want. It’s perfect for a special celebration or just because you can. 

Just make good choices. There are no grownups here and no rules, so you too can end up  your own worst enemy.

# Activities

I think a lot of people come here and never leave their villa. Most days, we didn’t see another guest unless someone was boarding a boat or showing up for dinner. But I’m an activities junkie and don’t sit still well, so our schedule was packed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The AAA (Anything, Anytime, Anywhere) model means you can do as much or as little as you want, with everything tailored to your interests and your timeline. The sheer variety of options ensures there’s something for everyone—and if your goal is to do absolutely nothing, Kudadoo is also a dream for serious rest and relaxation (see: the spa, below).

For me, snorkeling and diving were the standouts. It honestly felt like swimming in an aquarium, with coral reefs so vibrant and marine life so abundant it almost didn’t seem real. We mostly ended up diving because it was just that good. There were a couple of dives we actually repeated—because when you’re seeing turtles, sharks, rays, nudibranchs, lobsters, and a bajillion fish all in one go, how do you not? I hadn’t seen a reef in that healthy of a state in over a decade. It was thrilling, but also sobering to realize how much other places have been damaged.

We didn’t do most of the surface-level water sports, but they’re all included too: seabob (underwater scooter), jet skiing, stand-up paddleboarding, kayaking, kitesurfing lessons, flyboarding, waterskiing, wakeboarding—you name it. And if you're feeling a little more chill, you can hop on a catamaran with a skipper and just cruise. Or hang out in a cabana on the beach. 

On land, there are a few low-key options like board games, movies, and a pickleball court. But the island is tiny, so there’s not a ton to do on-site beyond that. Oh there is a very nice gym with gorgeous ocean view and tons of equipment. Plus, they offer personal training sessions if you want to do that. And also yoga and other workout classes. I didn’t do any of that though but my butler says next time I probably should hahaha. 

# Spa

The Sulha Spa is nothing short of a haven for relaxation and rejuvenation, offering unlimited treatments as part of your stay. Yes, you read that right—unlimited. That alone sets Kudadoo apart from every other luxury resort I’ve ever visited. Naturally, I made it my personal mission to try as many treatments as humanly possible, and I was completely blown away by the quality, consistency, and attention to detail. The staff are warm, intuitive, and incredibly skilled.

Perhaps not surprisingly to those of you who’ve figured out I have no chill and impulse control issues, I started treating spa visits like meals—one in the morning, one in the afternoon, and maybe a third if the mood struck. The treatment menu is extensive, with everything from classic hot stone and deep tissue massages to more specialized therapies like lymphatic drainage, reflexology, cupping, and even nail care. I loved that each session incorporated thoughtful little touches—perfectly warmed towels, aromatherapy oils chosen just for you, and locally inspired ingredients that made the whole experience feel rooted in place. I basically worked my way through the entire menu, so if you have questions, I’ve got answers. Personal favorites? The Oriental Fusion massage, which was both deeply relaxing and surprisingly therapeutic, and the Rejuvenation facial, which left my skin in tiptop shape.

Beyond the treatment rooms, there’s a salt therapy room as well as a sauna and steam room. Every visit starts with a delicious turmeric welcome drink and ends with a soothing cup of hot ginger tea. 

I’d kill to have a spa this good near my house. If I had one tiny suggestion, it would be to switch the nail polish to a quick-dry formula. They currently use regular OPI, which just doesn’t hold up well in the humidity because it takes forever to set and inevitably, I’d smudge or ding it within the hour.

# Final Thoughts

If you’re looking for a private, luxurious, and truly indulgent escape, Kudadoo is worth every penny. It’s the kind of place that makes you forget the outside world exists, which we all need sometimes. If only it didn’t take 24 hours to get there—because trust me, if it were closer, I’d be going once a year without question.

Sidenote: it’s nice to be able to once again bring you all a review of what I call a “just take my money” place. In summary: would sell a kidney to return. Give it all the stars.",1,1743172243.0,FATTravel,0,1.0,False

  She watched as the bus pulled away, good riddance! That bus had been the last thing from her old life, now she was in a new city, where no one knew her and she didn't know anyone else, that was how she liked it. All she had to do was find a street gang and prove herself, that would be easy. All that would be left was to stay away from the police, she hated to even think about going back to the old, abusive Carso foster home, or any foster home at all. She had escaped that place for a reason, now she could go back to graffiting and causing a wreck.



Finding a gang was easy and she quickly won all of their approvals faster than the last gang. At first they were hesitant since they were all boys, but after a trick or two they were pleading the already flabbergasted Alpha to let her in. It was just up to her skills and disguises to stay free and wild.



‘So whots your name?’ The alpha walked up to her in a supposedly strong way.

‘Names Prilny, but you can call me Pril, it's double short for Prilner-Prick, me mum wos a ganger.’ That was a lie, she didn't know what her mum had been and her name certainly wasn't Prilner-prick. The gang quickly accepted her and she soon became the bridge of the city's boys gang and new girls gang.

\*\*\*

One day the Alpha went out to do a solo wreck mission but he was gone for days, at first it wasn't a big deal but a week later they were watching the news in a gang claimed house and the news showed a video of the Alpha being put into a police car after robbing a store.

‘Oh well, we gonna have to go without ‘at old ogre, but we gonna need a new Alpha.’ The Alpha’s brother, Mot said while eating a stolen hot dog. Suddenly the room went quiet which was what happened in all of her past gangs when a new Alpha was needed, but this time everyone looked at her! 

‘Wot, why you lot all lookin at me, do I got a rat in me/my hair or somethin?’ She turned the TV off.

‘Pril could do it!’ Olo, one of the youngest of the gang said ‘After all she got the connection with em girls and 2 gangs joined is more fun than one and she be the best of us lot!’ She almost choked on her saliva, What! They wanted her to lead, she had led many gangs before but leading a girl one and a boy one? *Usually the oldest kids would fight to the strongest to lead*, she almost said that, but then realised that it would be a waste of time, she had- without meaning to- proven time and time again that she was stronger than even the old Alpha, besides the girls gang had been a messed gang and clearly needed a leader, so she could lead both of the gangs with ease.

‘Alrot, I’ll lead this gang better than that old rascal ever did.’ she said in as much of a strong voice as she could. The gang cheered, oh deer, she was well out of practice at being a leader.



Several months passed and the gangs joined up for many missions, with a new and all agreed, better alpha, both gangs increased in size rapidly, many experienced gang members quickly came from all around to join the growing, young rebellious gangs, but unlike the old alpha, Alphra, as she was now called, sought new members as well, she looked for people who desired to run free and cause mayhem. 



Things were going great, she felt back at home and the youngest children were given special, motherly like places in her heart, but one day while walking on the streets, something went terribly wrong and the police ended up handcuffing her, right there on the streets, she had tried to run away when she realised they were following her but they were way faster in the cop car.



She resisted their demands and it took them quite a few police to handcuff her. Suddenly she saw some of her gang members peeking around the corner, she rolled her eyes up, which meant act like civilians, they quickly joined the on watching crowds of people on either sides of the walking way, she found it funny, most of the ‘citizens 'were her gang and yet no one knew it. Once the police handcuffed her, she refused to speak as the cop gave her some questions, but the moment that she was dreading was coming, she would have to admit to her real name.

‘Stay civil please kid! According to The Carso’s you're the kid who ran from the Carso foster home eh?’ He held a piece of paper up to her face, ‘Says that your name is…’ She held her breath, was she really ready for this, whether she was or not it didn't matter because it was happening, her true identity was about to be revealed…again. ‘Mila-Lami Korila Fleming.’ Mila glanced at the gang, as she expected, they were all wide eyed and mouthed. 

‘You got me commander cop’ She forced a realistic sighed and terribly awkward acting. A few more people had gathered around at the mention of her name, she had been a very famous gang member, to commoners and gangers for several years now, she was often called the 'untameable mare'. 



Not wanting to attract any other people, the police put Mila into one of the cars and then drove off to a police station.



\*\*\*\*



Mila sighed, she was in a familiar room, with  Judge Alor a few yards away from her and her annoying ‘life saver’(interny), Myah beside her. The judges words went on, not even reaching Mila, at least not her brain. Suddenly a lady stood up in the stands and started talking, at first she wasn't interested but then when the lady said ‘new foster home’ she straightened up, ready to protest, but to her surprise she felt Myah grip her arm and dig her fake nails into Mila’s arm, *ouch!* She thought *Urgh! This stupid lady gonna be in trial for abusing a more wimpy kid someday!*

‘‘...Very well Mrs Bertlet, but if she fails to be changed then it will be *juvenile* prison for her. You may pick Mila-Lami Korila Fleming up from the foster centre on the eighth/8th of June.’’ He had only started to use her foster guardian's given middle name a few foster homes ago. Mila looked at the watch she had gotten from her Aunt when she had, at least to Mila abandoned her at 4 years old. *Today's the 3rd of June, great, another dumb old place that's a waste of* ***my*** *time.* She stared at Judge Alor as many people left, including the ‘foster home’ lady. The Judge had made it clear that he didn't lose any sleep over his job from the first time that Mila was sent to the ‘trial’, but Mila begged to differ, at least in the last few months he had been vulnerable to her. In a strange way, as far as Mila knew Judge Alor was the closest thing that she knew to a father, he had been the only person that was in her earliest memories to her latest.



\*\*\*



A week later Mila was in some sort of old looking Ford Handicapped car, going to some stupid farm.

‘’We’re so happy to have you here, our other foster daughter is so happy to finally have another girl at the farm most of the day.’ Mila didn’t respond, instead she looked out at the meadows they were passing by and so, taking the clue, Mrs Bertlet drove in silence for the remaining 5 minutes.



‘‘Ah here we are, someone should be home, that's good, I can’t reach my keys.’’ She rang the doorbell and then stepped back, they waited a few seconds for the door to open. Mila looked around and noticed that there were ramps everywhere and the door handle seemed ever so slightly lower than usual. The door was quickly opened by a tall, sturdy man with slightly whitened black hair, inside was a girl in a wheelchair with long orange locks and a few freckles on her face. The man sat back down on the couch, near the girl and Mrs Bertlet followed.

“Mila, this is my husband; Mr Bertlet, if you want you can call him Ed or dad.” She held hands with him, “And this is your foster sister; Julie. You also have 2 foster brothers, Matt and Ty, along with another 2 foster sister, Ruby-Jaz and Amy.” The freckle faced girl came towards her.

“Hi, I’ve been here for a few years, it's a great place and if you want I can show you around before dinner!” She seemed like a nice girl, why had she been sent here though?

“Um, maybe tomorrow, I need some time to rest.” When she was tired, it was hard to act cold to a really nice seeming girl.

“Okay that's fine, Mum will show you where you will be sleeping.” After a little discussion on how the rest of the day would go, they all split ways.



Mrs Bertlet showed Mila to the stairs which would lead them to her room. The two got to  a room at the start of the corridor and Mrs Bertlet opened it. To Mila’s surprise, it was a very clean and welcoming room, though it only housed a bed. Mila tried to hide her delight but with what she was used to, it was very hard.

“It's a bit empty because we usually go shopping on the first day for stuff, but it's a bit too late for you to go shopping. However, tomorrow or on the weekend you and the girls can spend some quality time and find some things that you like.” Mila was flabbergasted, it was a real room that she wasn’t sharing *and* she got to choose her own curtains, sheets, dresser, cupboard, posters and more cool things. Mila had to admit, however much she loved the gang style, this was already great!



Mrs Bertlet left Mila to get an idea of things she wanted, while she made dinner. Mila still acted cold with ease but she couldn’t hide her amazement. After what seemed like a few minutes Mrs Bertlet called for dinner. Mila wanted to stay in her very own room, but she hadn’t eaten since dinner the previous night and was starving. When Mila got to the table, the girl was already there in her wheelchair beside Mrs Bertlet, the table was a wooden oval shape, Mrs B was at one end and when Mr B came in, he sat at the other end. A few seconds after Mr B came in, three tired looking teens entered. The first girl had blonde/brunette hair and blue eyes, while the boy and the other girl both seemed to have orange hair and green eyes, Mila realised that they must be twins. After a few necessary protocols, they started to eat.

“Mila, this is Ruby-Jaz and Matt, them and Julie are triplets and this is Amy-Ivy.” Mila almost choked on her salad, that was why they looked so similar. “Ruby, Matt, Amy this is Mila, she is a bit younger than you guys and came from another foster home.” The two teens dropped their utensils, side-eyed each other and then looked at Mrs B questioningly in sinc with each other. The room was silent as they ate, it seemed they had all had a big day. One by one everyone excused themselves.

“You’ve had a big day and normally we take the next hour for bonding time, but today you can skip it.” Mr B had a kind face. 



For the next hour Mila lay on her new bed, trying to sleep. Around 9:50 Mrs B knocked on the door, 

“Can I please come in?” Mila just grunted as Mrs B walked in and sat at the end of the bed. “I know that you might be a little old, but I make at least 1 stuffed animal for all my foster kids, so here”, She handed Mila an elephant with a small heart on its ear, “I started making it after the judge allowed you to come here, I would also make you some clothes, but I’m out of the items I need to do so and I don’t know your style.” Without another word Mrs B walked to the door. “Oh and tomorrow at 9 you and the girls will head to the shops if that's okay. Goodnight.”

Mila lay looking at the sealing for a long time before falling asleep.

\*\*\*\*

The next day Mila woke up at 8:30 and immediately got up and dressed. When she got down stairs everybody was eating breakfast.

“Good morning Mila! Would you like a coffee and some pancakes?” Mrs B was at the stove.

“Okay.” She hadn’t had pancakes since…well forever!

“Oki-poki! By the way, we forgot to mention that your other foster brother;Ty, was hanging at a friend's house and still is so you won’t get to meet him till tomorrow at dinner. The girls had their coffee and then Mrs B drove them to the mall.



“Okay so where do you want to start!” Julie was a really happy person it seemed.

“Um, how about curtains.”

“Sure, have any fav places?”

“Um…Any options?” This felt a little weird, but she realised that Ruby-Jaz was getting a little curious.

“Aren't you like a specialist on this stuff, you’ve been in several foster homes and used to roam the streets of cities.” Her words shocked Mila, how did she know all of this so specifically? Apparently she had spoken aloud.

“Um…er…Y-Your Mila-Lami Korila Fleming right? Your all over the internet.” Even Julie seemed surprised at what her triplet knew. The three girls spent the rest of the day shopping until they had three trollies full of stuff.



Back at home the new foster sisters chatted in Mila’s room for hours, went down for dinner and then chatted some more until Julie headed to bed. Mila and Ruby kept talking, she really liked the girl already…

“So you watch youtube lots or somethin’?”

“Um…Well…If I’m being honest, I didn’t know you by media. I found out from my boyfriend, his name is Kore, but he used to go by the names of Mok, Reler and…Alpha” Ruby looked wearily at Mila, Mila was wide-eyed. Mok was the name of her old gang mate, Reler was one of her old foster siblings and Alpha…The city gang!

“What! How do you know him! And how was he 3 different people?”

“When he got caught, he got sent to his older sister's home, which is a few houses away, he also goes to the local high school with me. He said that he would dye his hair and use lenses to look different.” This was outrageous and Mila realised that she started school with Ruby the next day! The girls couldn’t talk any more because Mrs B sent them to bed.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Mila woke up and got dressed, wearing a new black t-shirt, pants and her gang necklace, she walked down stairs and got some food before heading out with the triplets to the bus. Mila sat at the back of the bus and when the older kids got on, they gave her one look, scowled and sat somewhere else, Mila wondered if they knew who she was. They arrived at school early and so Mila gave herself a tour of the place. Soon the bell went and so Mila walked to her first class; Homeroom in block 2. Once there, Mila found Julie and Ruby and sat with them. After a few minutes, Ruby stood at the door and a little while later she walked in with a tall, slim, dark haired boy. Mila almost vomited at the change in his looks, unlike his gang style; he had brushed hair and neat casual clothes, not torn or stained, just civilised yet she puzzled over why she hadn’t ever recognized him. Ruby sat down and he sat next to her. Luckily Mila had a hood on and was on the opposite side of Ruby. The teacher was a sub and so she didn’t need to be introduced.

\*\*\*

The day passed slowly and eventually it was the end of the day, Mila was sitting in the back of the bus, her hood still on.

\*\*\*\*

*Knock knock!* “Yes, come in.” Mila was busy sketching an early memory. “Ruby, hi. Come in!” Ruby shuffled in and sat on the bed where Mila had pointed.

“Um, hi. Just a heads up that Kore is joining us for dinner. It's mostly still the same as every night…except that it’ll be awkward at the least.” Ruby mumbled the last part under her breath. 

“Okay!” Mila rolled her eyes after Ruby left. It seemed that to Mok…Reler…Alpha… Kore or whatever his name was, she was still just another kid, he didn’t know who she really was.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Mila jumped down the stairs, it was almost time for dinner and it was the whole 'families' turn to help set up. While putting the plates out, Mila asked the family a favour;

“Hey, Ruby, Julie, Matt, Ivy?” The triplets nodded in response while the other girl glared.

“Its Amy, but yeah?”

“Oh, sorry, Amy. I just wanna ask if everyone could please call me…Myah! It was…er- The name that my Aunt gave me.” She internally cringed, that name was like drinking poison from a sewer!

The chilly evening air didn't seem to bother them as they stepped inside, ready to unwind.

Mojo Jojo stood out in a light gray tee with ""Louisiana"" printed on the back, paired with navy blue twill shorts and Navy/Cobalt Nike Air Max 270 Sneakers. He layered a gray Patagonia fleece jacket over his shirt and carried a navy blue The North Face backpack, looking every bit the traveler.

Sedusa, as always, exuded elegance in a charcoal gray pantsuit and black pumps. A sleek black Coach purse completed her polished look, making it clear she was no stranger to sophistication.

Femme Fatale went for a more laid-back vibe with a white top and light-wash straight jeans. Her Cognac Woven Mary Jane Ballet Flats from Target and denim jacket were effortlessly stylish, while a cognac shoulder purse added a touch of warmth to her outfit.

Ace, in his signature cool-guy fashion, wore a black tee, gray skinny jeans, and snakeskin boots, with black shades hiding his eyes. His black leather jacket was a constant reminder of his tough exterior, even in a relaxed setting.

Arturo opted for comfort with a white tee, black joggers, and classic white/black Nike Air Force 1 sneakers. A black Nike hooded zippered jacket completed his casual, yet stylish look.

Snake kept it simple but still eye-catching in a black tee shirt and khaki shorts, with black Vans SK8-Hi sneakers on his feet. His antique green army jacket gave him an edge, while the cream canvas tote bag—emblazoned with the words ""Stanford, Stanford, Stanford, Stanford""—added an unexpected twist to his ensemble.

They all gathered together, each bringing their unique flair to the table, ready to catch up after their long journey.

They walked into the diner, the warm aroma of sizzling food filling the air. As soon as the door swung open, the familiar clink of silverware and chatter paused for a moment. Behind the counter, Andrea, the friendly waitress with a perpetual smile, immediately spotted her friend.

Her eyes brightened as she waved energetically toward the corner of the room. ""Claire!"" Andrea called out, her voice carrying across the room. ""Look who's here! You're our favorite regular!"" She beamed, crossing the floor with a friendly swagger.

Femme Fatale, known to most as Claire, chuckled softly and returned the wave, her dark sunglasses perched on top of her head. She had an air of effortless grace, and even the most mundane moments seemed to hold a touch of intrigue when she was around.

""Six,"" Femme Fatale replied, her tone as smooth as silk, her smile never faltering. ""And Andrea, don't forget to send me your digits if you're free later!"" she teased, the playful glint in her eyes unmistakable.

Andrea, unfazed by Femme Fatale's playful flirtation, grinned and grabbed six menus from the stack behind the counter. ""You know I never forget,"" she said, her laughter light and infectious. ""Come on, your table's ready,"" she added, guiding Femme Fatale and her group to the table

As they walked to the table, Andrea tossed a wink over her shoulder. ""Enjoy your meal, and don't hesitate to ask for anything! You know I've got your back.""

The diner, always a little slice of comfort, buzzed with anticipation as Femme Fatale and her group settled in, the familiar hum of conversation filling the air once more. Andrea's eyes stayed on the table for a moment, thinking about the subtle promise that lingered between her and Femme Fatale. After all, this wasn't just another day at the diner—it was a night for possibilities.

Zoey, the waitress, approached Femme Fatale and her group at the table, her notepad already in hand. She flashed a friendly smile and asked, ""Hi, I'm Zoey. What can I get you to drink?""

Mojo Jojo, tapping away on his iPhone 15 Pro with its sleek navy-blue case, looked up and said with a grin, ""I'll have a Zero Sugar Coca-Cola.""

Femme Fatale, holding her iPhone 15, gave Zoey a cool smile. ""Diet Coke for me,"" she replied smoothly, placing the phone down gently on the table.

Ace, casually scrolling through his iPhone 13, which was tucked into a black case with an "" Ace of Spades"" decal on the back, chimed in. ""Coca-Cola for me.""

Arturo, with his Samsung S25 in hand and a matte black case, nodded in agreement. ""Coca-Cola,"" he said, setting his phone down next to his plate.

Snake, holding his iPhone 16 Plus in a simple black case, looked up briefly and said, ""Water, please.""

Finally, Sedusa, with her iPhone 16 in a striking red case, smiled softly and said, ""Water for me, too.""

Zoey jotted down their orders quickly, making sure she didn't miss anything. ""Great, I'll be right back with your drinks!"" she said, before heading back toward the kitchen, leaving the group to chat among themselves.

""Alright, here's why we're here,"" Femme Fatale began, her tone serious as she leaned forward, eyes scanning the group. ""This is about HIM. We need to confess how we became villains because of HIM...""

""I've noticed it too,"" Ace interjected quickly, a hint of frustration in his voice. ""HIM's been acting strange lately. I saw it myself when he grinned at Mojo Jojo during his emotional breakdown about losing his mother. That's when I knew—HIM's nothing but two-faced.""

Mojo Jojo let out a deep, angry sigh. ""Exactly. HIM turned me into a supervillain, and I've hated it ever since. I don't even know who HIM really is anymore. I can't trust him.""

Femme Fatale nodded in agreement, her expression hardening. ""That's why we need to figure this out. HIM's the one who twisted us all into this mess.""

Before anyone could respond further, Zoey, the waitress, walked up with a tray of drinks in her hands. ""Here you go!"" she said with a smile, carefully placing each drink in front of them. She looked around the table. ""What can I get you to eat?""

Arturo, who had been quietly listening, flipped open the menu and spoke first. ""Fish tacos,"" he said, his eyes scanning the page.

""I'll have the Diner Bowl,"" Sedusa said, her tone cool and collected as she made her choice.

Femme Fatale mirrored Sedusa's order. ""The same for me—Diner Bowl.""

Snake, who had been casually scrolling on his phone, set it down and glanced at the menu. ""Turkey burger with friesss,"" he said, a hint of anticipation in his voice.

Ace, with a grin, placed his order. ""Classic Reuben with potato chips.""

Finally, Mojo Jojo sighed, and ordered, ""Patty melt with fries, please.""

Zoey nodded, writing down their orders with a quick flick of the pen. ""Got it! I'll get these right out to you,"" she said before heading back toward the kitchen, leaving the group to continue their conversation.

""How about we talk to Rob tomorrow morning about our confessions regarding HIM?"" Sedusa suggested, taking a sip of her drink.

""But there's one problem—I'm living in Silver Spring, Maryland..."" Arturo said. ""Maybe I'll call my cousin to bring over my clothes and toiletries.""

""Arturo, Snake, you guys can crash at my place tonight,"" Ace offered, inviting them to stay over. ""Murdoc doesn't mind if I have friends over.""

""Man, I really appreciate it. I'll call my cousin to bring my stuff,"" Arturo replied.

""Sedusa, mind if I crash at your place tonight?"" Femme Fatale asked. ""I really don't feel like commuting to Rosslyn from D.C.""

""Sure thing, Claire!"" Sedusa replied with a smile.

""Can I ask you something, Sedusa?"" Femme Fatale inquired. ""What's your real name?""

""My real name is Amanda Selker,"" Sedusa replied. ""From now on, I'm not representing Sedusa anymore. Just call me Amanda.""

""Your name is lovely,"" Femme Fatale said with a smile. ""From now on, call me Claire. My real name is Claire Horentech.""

""I'm jumping on your bandwagon!"" Mojo Jojo chimed in, taking a sip of his Zero Sugar Coca-Cola. ""From now on, call me Jojo, or Joseph 'Jojo' Utonium.""

""Jojo is a cute name; it reminds me of Jojo Siwa,"" Femme Fatale said, playfully patting Mojo Jojo on the back.

Mojo Jojo shot her a playful middle finger, but before the moment could escalate, the waitress arrived with their meals—heaping plates of Fish Tacos, two Diner Bowls, Burkey Burger, Classic Reuben, and Patty Melt. The mouthwatering smell filled the air, and the conversation shifted as everyone eagerly dug in.

Twenty minutes later, the plates were nearly empty. Mojo Jojo wiped his mouth with a napkin and turned to Femme Fatale, saying, ""Thanks for recommending this place for dinner, Claire. Our meals were incredible!""

""The Classic Reuben was the best bite I've had!"" Ace chimed in, offering a warm smile and a wink. ""Thanks, Claire!""

Zoey approached their table, holding the bills in her hand. ""Here are your bills,"" she said, handing them over.

Mojo Jojo glanced at the total and then looked up at the group. ""I need to calculate the split for six people on this bill,"" he said, pulling out his phone to do some quick math.

Ace leaned back in his chair, raising an eyebrow. ""Man, you're going all accountant on us now?""

""Hey, someone has to make sure it's fair,"" Mojo Jojo replied with a smirk, tapping away at his screen. The others chuckled as he quickly calculated the split, ensuring no one was shortchanged. He then placed his red, yellow, and orange Wells Fargo debit card on the table next to the bill.

""Here,"" Arturo said, sliding his red Bank of America debit card onto the pile.

""Here,"" Femme Fatale added, placing her sleek navy-blue Capital One debit card beside the others.

""Here,"" Sedusa chimed in, confidently placing her clear American Express credit card on the stack.

""Here,"" Snake followed, putting his own navy-blue Capital One debit card down.

""Here,"" Ace said with a grin, sliding his black debit card embossed with the words ""Ace of Spades"" onto the table, making sure everyone saw it.

The group exchanged amused looks as they all piled their cards together. Mojo Jojo quickly glanced at the total again, making sure everything was even. ""Looks like we're all set,"" he said, before handing over his card to Zoey with a nod.

""Don't forget to tip our waitress,"" Arturo reminded the group, holding up a twenty-dollar bill. ""Zoey did a great job taking care of us.""

He gave a small nod toward the waitress, who had been attentive and friendly throughout the meal. The others quickly followed suit, pulling out cash or adding extra to their cards, all agreeing that Zoey deserved a nice tip for her excellent service.

Mojo Jojo suddenly glanced at his phone, his eyes widening as a new notification popped up. He read it aloud, though his voice faltered slightly.

Professor: ***Jojo, can you get pads for one of your sisters? Bubbles got her first period earlier today. I'll put some money in your joint account.***

Mojo Jojo froze for a moment, his face flushing a deep shade of red. The unexpected news caught him off guard, and he could feel the heat rising in his cheeks. He looked up at the group, trying to mask his embarrassment, but his usual confidence was shaken. Mojo Jojo typed.

Mojo Jojo: ***Sure thing, dad. I'll head to Target soon.***

""Uh… well, looks like I have... some... shopping to do,"" Mojo Jojo stammered, his voice a little higher than usual.

Ace raised an eyebrow, catching the shift in Mojo's demeanor. ""What's up, man? You good?""

Mojo Jojo cleared his throat, trying to recover. ""Yeah, just... uh, family stuff,"" he muttered, still feeling awkward.

Femme Fatale raised an eyebrow playfully. ""Family stuff? What kind of family stuff?""

Mojo Jojo quickly added, ""It's fine! Just... buying pads for Bubbles, no big deal,"" he said with a dismissive wave, though his blush was still evident.

The others exchanged amused glances, but to their credit, they didn't press him further. Sedusa leaned in with a teasing grin. ""Hey, it's a big brother's duty, right? You're handling it like a champ, Jojo.""

Mojo Jojo muttered something under his breath, still adjusting to the unexpected role he'd just been assigned. ""Yeah, sure... no problem.""

""Let's head to Target at Columbia Heights,"" Femme Fatale suggested, slipping on her denim jacket. She turned to Sedusa and asked, ""Amanda, can you call the Uber to Columbia Heights? I'll Zelle you the money!""

""Of course, Claire!"" Sedusa grinned, pulling out her phone. ""I'll get it set up right now."" She quickly tapped a few buttons, glancing up at the others. ""This is gonna be fun. I haven't been to that Target in a while.""

Mojo Jojo raised an eyebrow. ""Are we just going for the pads, or is there something else we're picking up too?"" ""Why not both?""

Femme Fatale replied with a wink. ""A little shopping never hurt anyone.""

Ace chuckled. ""True. Might as well grab some snacks while we're at it.""

Sedusa nodded, hitting the confirm button on the Uber app. ""All set. The ride's coming in five minutes."" ""Perfect!""

Femme Fatale said, flashing a grin. ""Let's go stock up. Target run, here we come!""

Femme Fatale and her group walked out of the diner, waited for the Uber.

Femme Fatale and her group stepped out of the diner, the cool evening air brushing against their faces. They gathered on the sidewalk, chatting and laughing as they waited for the Uber to arrive.

""So, what's everyone getting at Target?"" Sedusa asked, adjusting her jacket and glancing at her phone to track the ride.

""I'm definitely grabbing some snacks,"" Ace said with a grin, kicking a small pebble down the sidewalk. ""Maybe some new boxers too. Mine are getting... a little questionable.""

Mojo Jojo shrugged, clearly still a bit flustered from the earlier text. ""I'm just here for the pads... and maybe a few other things. I've got to make sure Bubbles is covered.""

Femme Fatale smirked. ""Don't worry, Jojo. You're doing great. You're a pro now.""

""Yeah, yeah,"" Mojo Jojo muttered, rolling his eyes but with a small smile. ""I'm just glad no one is making me pick out... uh, feminine products in person.""

Sedusa chuckled, glancing at the others. ""It's just part of being a good brother. And hey, it's not like you haven't handled worse things.""

""True,"" Mojo Jojo conceded, folding his arms. ""But I could've done without the surprise.""

Their laughter filled the air as the Uber pulled up, its headlights cutting through the night. Femme Fatale opened the door and motioned for everyone to get in.

""Alright, let's go before we end up shopping for hours,"" she said, slipping into the backseat.

The group piled in, the car's interior warm and cozy as they set off toward Columbia Heights, excited for their unexpected Target adventure.

\-----

Femme Fatale and her group pulled up to Target on 14th Street NW, right in the heart of Columbia Heights, stepping out of the Uber XL. As Sedusa took in the familiar surroundings, memories of her villainous past came rushing back.

""I remember this place,"" Sedusa said with a smirk. ""I used to steal everything from Target and Marshalls around here.""

As they entered the building and made their way to the escalator leading up to Target, Ace raised an eyebrow. Spotting Lidi on the right, he turned to the group and asked, ""Lidi? What's that about?""

Femme Fatale shrugged. ""I have no idea.""

Arturo chimed in, ""Lidi is the supermarket where my parents buy some groceries.""

""Oh…"" Ace muttered, a faint blush creeping onto his cheeks.

They entered the store, and Femme Fatale grabbed a shopping cart. ""You can pick up what you need,"" she said. ""Let's meet at the registers.""

""Okay, I have to ask you both, Claire and Amanda..."" Mojo Jojo said, his face turning slightly red. ""What's the best pad for a 10-year-old girl? This is for my sister, Bubbles.""

""Try Always Radiant Teen Feminine Pads,"" Femme Fatale suggested, giving Mojo Jojo a reassuring look. ""They're designed for younger girls, so they should work well for Bubbles."" She paused for a moment, then added, ""I can help you choose the right size and explain how they work. It's important to pick something comfortable and absorbent, especially for someone her age.""

""Thanks, Claire. This is really helpful,"" Mojo Jojo said with a grateful nod.

""I've got to check out the new booksss,"" Snake said, his eyes lighting up. ""Maybe the latessst one from *The Hunger Games*—I've been dying to read it!""

""I need to pick up some small groceries and essentials for my family,"" Arturo said.

""I've got to check out the boxers,"" Ace added, ""and grab some snacks while I'm at it.""

Snake and Ace made their way to the escalator, while Femme Fatale led Mojo Jojo to the feminine products aisle. Arturo headed to the grocery section, and Sedusa wandered off to browse the women's clothing.

Forty-five minutes later, their cart was brimming with items. Femme Fatale glanced at the group and said, ""Alright, let's head to the registers.""

Femme Fatale picked out a dark-wash Universal Thread mid-rise denim mini skirt, a white Universal Thread tee, a Universal Thread jumbo matte tort claw hair clip, Angie's Boomchickapop Sweet & Salty Kettle Corn Popcorn, and Elf Lip Oil in Clear. She held her District of Columbia EBT card and a navy-blue Capital One Debit Card.

Sedusa grabbed a white A New Day tee shirt, a black A New Day tee shirt, beige A New Day high-rise tailored trousers, Dove Beauty Serum Body Wash with 2% Niacinamide, and BHA Refining Serum in Skin Replenish. She held her navy-blue Capital One Debit Card.

Ace threw in Doritos Golden Sriracha Tortilla Chips, Doritos Spicy Nacho Tortilla Chips, Favorite Day Sour Gummi Worms Candy, Favorite Day Milk Chocolate Covered Mini Pretzels, Funyuns Minis Flamin' Hot Canister, Clear Eyes Maximum Strength Eye Drops, and a black/galaxy Pair of Thieves Men's Boxer Briefs 2pk. He held his black debit card, embossed with the words ""Ace of Spades.""

Arturo grabbed two cans of Juanita's Foods Mexican-Style Hominy, Good & Gather Mexican-Inspired Roasted Jalapeno Enchilada Sauce, Mateo's Gourmet Medium Salsa, avocados, bananas, three cans of Las Palmas Enchilada Sauce, Siete Mexican Shortbread Cookies, Café Bustelo Unsweetened Espresso-Style Iced Coffee, Goya Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce, Goya Black Beans, snacks, Always Maxi Pads Overnight Absorbency Unscented without Wings (for his younger sister), and Crest + Scope Complete Whitening Toothpaste - Minty Fresh. He held his Maryland EBT card and cash.

Snake picked up *The Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping* Hardcover Book, dark khaki Original Use Straight Leg Pull-On Carpenter Pants, Native Premium Detoxifying Charcoal with Mint Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, and Harry's 5-Blade Men's Razor Blade Refills - 4pk. He held his Target Redcard Credit Card.

Mojo Jojo grabbed Dude Wipes Fragrance-Free Flushable Wipes, Goldfish Cheddar Cheese Crackers Baked with Whole Grain Carton, and a white Stanley 30 oz Stainless Steel H2.0 Flowstate Quencher Tumbler for himself. For his family, he picked up a bag of Honeycrisp apples, bananas, Always Radiant FlexFoam Teen Pads Regular Absorbency with Wings – Unscented (for Bubbles), Dawn Lemon Essence Free & Clear Ez Squeeze Dishwashing Liquid, Bounty Paper Towels, Cheez-its, and Elf Lip Oil in Clear. Mojo Jojo held his Target Redcard Credit Card for himself and a red, yellow, and orange Wells Fargo debit card for his family.

As they checked out and gathered their receipts, the Assets Protection Specialists noticed them immediately and exchanged knowing looks. Rising from their posts, they moved toward the group with purpose. One of the specialists, with a stern expression, stepped forward and addressed them.

""FROZE!"" he called out, his voice sharp and commanding. ""Are all of you attempting to steal anything from here?!"" His eyes scanned the group suspiciously, as if expecting some sign of mischief. The others, standing with their arms crossed, waited for an explanation. The tension in the air was thick, the old memories of their past lives as villains lingering just beneath the surface.

""Um, sir... we already paid for everything, and we have our receipts,"" Ace said, stammering slightly as he nervously fidgeted with his shopping bag. His eyes darted between the Assets Protection Specialists, trying to keep his cool.

""We've been through the checkout, everything's legit,"" Femme Fatale added smoothly, stepping forward with an air of confidence. She gave the specialist a pointed look, her voice calm but firm. ""You might want to check the system before jumping to conclusions.""

Mojo Jojo, ever the one to add a little flair, couldn't help but mutter under his breath, ""Seriously? You think we're going to steal from Target? We're reformed, guys.""

The specialist hesitated, his suspicion lingering for a moment longer, but the receipts were clear, and the group had no intention of causing trouble. The tension slowly eased, though the awkwardness still hung in the air.

""Remember, we were sent to the residential treatment program to help us understand the concept of redemption,"" Sedusa said, holding up her receipt with a calm but resolute expression. ""It's not just about seeking forgiveness; it's about atoning for our past wrongs and working to restore our integrity, reputation, and moral standing."" She paused, letting the words sink in before continuing. ""Redemption means actively correcting our mistakes, changing our behavior, and proving we're capable of becoming better. That's what we've been doing—taking responsibility for who we were and working to be who we can be.""

Her voice was steady, firm, as though she was reminding herself as much as the specialists. ""We're not here to steal; we're here to rebuild. We've earned these receipts—just like we've earned the chance to make things right.""

One of the Assets Protection Specialists glanced at the others, clearly taken aback by Sedusa's composed explanation. Another, more skeptical, folded his arms and gave her a sharp look. ""So you expect us to just take your word for it?""

Sedusa met his gaze with confidence. ""Redemption isn't just a story we tell—it's a process. We've spent months working on ourselves, attending counseling, making restitution, and showing we can change. It's more than just words; it's been about action.""

Mojo Jojo, ever the one to add a bit of sass, chimed in, ""And what better place to show we've turned a corner than Target? We're not exactly on a crime spree, if that's what you're wondering.""

Femme Fatale added, her tone both calm and persuasive, ""Redemption isn't instantaneous. We understand it takes time to rebuild trust, but we've been doing the work. The real question is, can you recognize the difference between who we were and who we are now?""

The specialists exchanged uncertain glances, and slowly, their stance softened. The tension in the air began to lift as they processed the group's sincere words. Still, one couldn't help but notice the lingering doubt in the eyes of the security team, a reminder that some battles—like redemption—take more than just actions. They take time.

""Alright, alright… We're sorry for jumping to conclusions,"" one of the Assets Protection Specialists said, his tone softening. The others nodded, their faces shifting from suspicion to understanding. ""You can go ahead.""

A warm smile spread across his face as he gestured toward the exit. ""We appreciate your patience. Have a nice evening.""

The tension in the air dissipated as the group exchanged glances, relief spreading among them. Femme Fatale gave a subtle nod, acknowledging the apology, while Sedusa simply smiled. Mojo Jojo muttered, ""Guess redemption doesn't just apply to us.""

Ace chuckled quietly. ""It's a start.""

As they made their way out of the store, the specialists returned to their posts, watching the former villains walk out, not as troublemakers, but as individuals who had truly started down the path of redemption. It was clear that trust, like redemption, wasn't something easily given—but maybe, just maybe, it was something that could be earned over time.

""Her wolf never showed… until *he* did. 🌕🐾  

Amie thought she was fine without her wolf—until her mate *rejected her* and shattered her heart. 💔 Running away, she started over among humans, leaving werewolves and packs behind.  

But then Finlay, the smitten Alpha, found her. 🐺💕 He didn’t care that she was a *latent wolf*—he wanted her in his pack.  

Now, her wolf has awakened, and she’s found happiness with Finlay and her new pack. But when the *Pack Games* bring her face-to-face with the man who rejected her, everything changes. 🔄💥  

Will this twist tear them apart… or make them stronger? 👀

Chapter 1


I walked over the grass, carrying a pile of wool blankets. We were setting up for tonight's full moon celebrations. I love these monthly gatherings of the pack. We eat, laugh, tell stories of the pack's history and of the gods`. Then those that can shift will run in the woods. The rest of us, we stay behind and pretend we aren’t envious of the others. For eighteen years I have been part of the group who is left by the fire to watch the pups and make sure the fire stays in the firepit. It was getting old, I wanted my wolf to come to me, I wanted to prove I wasn’t a dud. 



“Hi, pumpkin.” I turned toward the sound of my father and smiled. He had been out checking the woods together with the Alpha and Gamma in preparation for the night. 



“Hi, dad,” I called as I placed the blankets down on a log and then took some of them and placed on other logs we used to sit on around the fire. They were more for coziness than for warmth, all werewolves ran hot. Even those like me who didn’t have a wolf. Yet, I added. 



“Looking forward to tomorrow?” the Alpha Mark asked as he, Gamma Jonas and my father walked up to me. 



“Kind of,” I said. 



“What do you mean, kind of, green bean?” Gamma Jonas asked. He, my father and the Alpha were best friends, had been all of their lives. No one had been surprised when Alpha Mark had named my father his Beta and Jonas his Gamma as he took over the running of the pack from his father. That had been years before me and my brother were born. We grew up with the Alpha and Gamma families as an extension of our own. My brother, Elder, was best friends with James, the Alpha’s son. Everyone expected me to be best friends with Cindy, Gamma Jonas’ daughter. But we didn’t get along at all. We just remained on friendly terms because of our families. 



“I think my pumpkin is nervous. Turning eighteen is a big step,” dad said, placing his arm around me and pulling me to his side. 



“That’s right. She will be able to sense her mate and he will be able to identify her if they both are over eighteen,” the Alpha said with a big smile. 



“She’s too young for that kind of thing,” my dad scowled and both of his friends burst out laughing. My dad and Alpha Mark were partly right. I was nervous about being able to sense my mate. But there was more. My wolf still hadn’t come to me, I had never been able to shift and for each full moon that came and went I looked weaker in the eyes of other werewolves. You started to be able to shift between the age of sixteen and twenty-five. Everyone knew the younger you were when your wolf came, the stronger it, and therefore you, would be. James had shifted for the first time a month after turning sixteen, my brother seven months after his sixteenth birthday. Cindy had been a little over seventeen when she shifted. I was almost eighteen and I hadn’t even felt a slight tingle during a full moon. I was afraid that if I found my mate, he would think I was too weak. 



“You're not still worried about your wolf, are you, little one?” the Alpha asked. I nodded. We had had this conversation many times in the last two years. “Armeria Rose Winstone, two years is nothing. She will come to you,” he said. I flinched as he used my full name. My mother has a thing for all things growing and has named her only two children after her favorite plants. My father didn’t object because he loves her too much to not let her have her way. 



“I know, Alpha,” I said. 



“You are perfect, just the way you are, pumpkin,” my father said and kissed the top of my head. 



“You have to say that, you’re my father,” I pointed out. 



“And if some boy tells you anything else, you tell us and we will beat his ass.”



“Thank you uncle Jonas,” I said.



“Any time,” he told me and ruffled my hair. I objected and tried to get away, but my father laughed and kept me in place. I hated when people messed with my hair. It was hard to keep under control with its red curls at the best of times, but mess with it and it just became one big poof of tangles and frizz. 



“Okay, enough lazing around. Move your asses. I will see you later tonight, little one, and after midnight we will celebrate your big day,” the Alpha told us. 



“Fine, we’re coming,” my father sighed with pretend annoyance. Sometimes I think the three of them are stuck in a permanent teenager mode, and it scares me a little to think of them running the pack. But they are good at it. Our pack is one of the strongest and most highly thought of packs in the world. It’s a pride to all of us. As my father and his two friends continued their inspection, I got back to my tasks for the evening. Usually I would help my mother as she and some other women prepared the food. But I had been put on other duties and I’m guessing, and hoping, it’s because they are working on a surprise cake for my birthday. As I walked over to Sally, Jonas’ mate, to get information about which games she has been planning for the pups, I tried to remember that I’m lucky. I have a good family, I have good friends and a good pack. So what if I don’t have a wolf? Three out of four isn’t a bad thing, right? And if I found my mate and he loves me as mates do, then I will have four out of five. That would be fantastic. Unless he rejects you because you don’t have a wolf, a small voice in my head kept saying. It’s like the voice is a broken record, playing over and over again in my head. 



Hours later, I was sitting in front of the fire, laughing along with the others as Nick, one of the oldest warriors in the pack, was telling the story about how he had defeated a swarm of vampires. The number of vampires went up for each full moon. But we all loved listening to him telling the story. Most of the pack members were running in their wolf form in the surrounding forest. I still hadn’t felt the need to shift, so as usual I volunteered to watch the pups and keep an eye on the teenagers. It was just after midnight when the pack started to return. In groups or pairs they came walking out of the woods, they were all smiling and looked relaxed. I wondered why they were heading back so early when my mother and Luna Joy came walking with a birthday cake between them. I could feel my eyes grow big as I looked at the amazing creation that was put down in front of me. It was three tiers tall with white frosting and covered in sugar flowers, it looked like a flower meadow. On top two candles burned, a one and an eight. 



“Happy birthday, sweetie,” my mother said. 



“Thank you, mom.” My mother hugged me, and then Luna Joy drew me into a tight hug as well.



“I hope you will find your mate soon and that he is everything you hope for and deserve,” Luna whispered to me.



“Thank you, Luna,” I said. 



“Time to blow out the candles and make a wish, pumpkin,” my dad said as he joined us. 



“Not yet. Elder isn’t here yet,” my mother pointed out. 



“He is off with James and Cindy,” Luna Joy said as she snuggled up to the Alpha. 



“I can wait,” I offered, which earned me a smile from the Alpha pair.



“Honestly, the whole pack is here and we are waiting on our son,” my mother said and I could hear the impatience in her voice. I heard my brother and our friends before I saw them. My brother came half running out of the forest, closely followed by James while Cindy took her time. 



“Sorry, sorry, I didn’t realise how deep into the forest we had run. You didn’t blow out the candles yet, did you?” Elder asked.



“No, she has been waiting,” our mother told him, giving him a look that told everyone she wasn’t happy.



“Sorry,” he said again. Me? I wasn’t paying any attention to what my brother was saying. My full attention was on the scent of sandalwood and pineapple. Even without my wolf, I knew it was the scent of my mate. I turned towards it as I saw James standing at the edge of the forest, looking back at me with just as much surprise as I felt. James, the Alpha’s son, was my mate? 







Chapter 2


“Armeria,” James said. He said it in a low, wistful voice. 



“James,” I answered. I hardly noticed how everyone around us cleared the space, giving us a clear view of each other. It was important to give a newly mated pair space as the protectiveness was at an all time high until they had claimed each other. I faintly heard my father and the Alpha laughing as they congratulated each other. I saw a shadow pass over James’ face and I knew him well enough that my heart and stomach sank.



“Amie,” James said, using the nickname the pack used. His voice was sad and I tried to brace for what I knew was coming. He took a few steps towards me, but I couldn’t move, I couldn’t look away from his eyes. They told me what he was going to say before he let the words fly. “I’m sorry, Amie, but I can’t. You know I can’t,” he said. I knew it was coming, but still, each word felt like a physical punch. The pack had gone deadly silent, everyone was listening and for a moment, I wished James’ words had been physical punches. Then I would have a chance to pass out, or die. Anything but stand in the middle of the pack being rejected by the one person who should love me above all others. “I will become Alpha one day, I need a strong Luna,” James continued, as if he didn’t know he was tearing my heart from my body. “Amie, you don’t have a wolf, even if you get one, we all know it will be weak. I love you, you know I do. But my duty is to the pack, and this pack deserves a strong Luna,” he finished. There was only silence for a long while. I tried to find my words. My first instinct was to plead, to tell James I could be anything he wanted me to be. I could change. But the part of me that made my mother sigh in despair and complain about how stubborn her daughter was, held me back. 



“Son,” the Alpha gently said. “You don’t need to do this now.”



“It would be cruel to give her hope. I won’t do that to her,” James said. 



“You need to think this through, son. This is not the place or the time.” There was a warning in the Alpha’s voice. 



“I won’t change my mind,” James insisted. I felt my father and mother walk up to flank me. My mother put her arm around my waist. 



“James, think about what you are doing, you are mates. The gods have decided you complete each other,” my father said. 



“I’m sorry,” was all James said. 



“You won’t be able to join the games.” My father’s voice was cold and a murmur in the pack followed his words. The games were how the packs determined influence and the amount of votes they would get at the yearly pack summit. The games were held every tenth year, and each pack sent the five most promising pack members and a support staff to enter. It was not just physical challenges they would face. Everything was tested, from strength to endurance to intelligence and cunning. My pack always ended up in the top ten, the last fifty years we had been in the top five. To be one of the five pack members sent to the games, you had to be over eighteen and in full physical and mental health. What my father had pointed out was that the break of a mate bond was considered to be a mental wound. The council would demand at least three months to heal from it before they deemed someone to be in full health. The games were in a month's time. James looked like he reconsidered his decision, and my hope flared. I knew how much he and my brother had been looking forward to entering the games. We had all trained hard, even me, and the Alpha would be announcing the selected representatives any day. 



“So be it, I will sit this year’s games out and join the next ones,” he then said, the determination clear on his face. The last ember of hope was extinguished in my chest. I vaguely heard Luna Joy saying something, but I had stopped listening. My hands had been clenched by my sides until now. But I reached for my mother and took a hold of her arm.



‘I can’t be here anymore,’ I mindlinked her. I heard the soft whimper that came from her as she pulled me into a hug, placing herself between me and James and leading me away. The pack gave us way as we walked towards our house. I was numb from the pain that radiated in me. I saw the looks the other pack members were giving me, but I tried not to register them. It was bad enough to be pitied for not having a wolf. Now they would pity me for being rejected by the future Alpha as well. Some of them reached out and gently ran their hands over my arms as we passed. It was a sign of comfort and support. But it didn’t help. I remembered the promise uncle Jonas had given only hours before. That he and his friends would beat any male that thought me weak. I guess that didn’t apply when the male was your best friend’s son and the future Alpha. I felt the bitterness of my own thoughts and it was what made the first broken sob escape me. To my relief, my mother and I were almost at our home and we had long since left the pack behind us. My mother tightened her hold on me and made soft cooing sounds that reminded me of my childhood, when I used to fall and bruise my knees. 



“Let's sit on the couch for a while,” my mother suggested. I just shook my head. I wanted to crawl into my bed and never get out of it again. “Okay, sweetie,” she agreed without me having to say a word. She just took me upstairs, helped me out of my clothes and into my sleep shirt before tucking me into bed. I curled into a ball, my knees tight to my chest and my arms hugging them. My back was to my mother as she sat down on the bed and stroked my hair and gently hummed the old lullabies she used to sing for me and Elder. My tears finally came and once the first one rolled down my cheek, the rest followed. I was quietly crying while my body trembled from the power of the raw emotions rolling through me. I heard the door open and close downstairs and I felt the scent of my father. I may not have a wolf, but my smell, eyesight and hearing was still better than a human's. But nowhere near a werewolf’s. My father walked into my room and sat down next to my mother on my bed. No one spoke, but I felt his heavy hand on my leg. I don’t know how long we stayed like that. It could have been hours, or minutes. Somewhere along the way, I stopped crying and my body settled down. The pain still remained, no less than before. My mind started to move again even though I suspected my parents thought I was asleep. I noticed the absence of my brother. It hurt almost as much as my mate’s rejection. He had chosen James over me. I had a hard time believing it. It was true he was best friends with the future Alpha. But he and I had always been close, at least I had thought so. There was a knock on the front door and my father left. Being raised werewolf meant learning not to eavesdrop on conversations despite being able to. But I felt like I had a right to listen in now, it most likely was something regarding me anyway. 



“How is she doing?” It was the Alpha, it seemed my father had taken him into his study, as far away as they could go from my bedroom. 



“How do you think she is doing?” I was shocked by the anger and disrespect in my father’s voice. I had never heard him talk to anyone like that, especially not his best friend and Alpha. “She hasn’t spoken, not after what James did to her.”



“I’m sorry, Ron.” The Alpha sounded honest. 



“His mind is made up?” my father asked. 



“It is.”



“What will you do?” 



“What do you mean, Ron?” the Alpha asked.



“Do you expect my daughter to live in the same pack as the male that ripped her heart out and stomped on it in front of the entire pack? You know as well as I do what our rules are if someone breaks the mate bond without a good reason.” My fathers voice was low, full of tension.



“Ron! You can’t think I would ever make James, my only son, go live in another pack. Banish him from the pack he was born to lead?”



“Why not? No one is above the law. The law is in place to protect the innocent victim. Amie is the victim here,” my father insisted. 



“What James did, he didn’t handle it correctly. But Ron, he had a good reason to do what he did.” I almost drew in a sharp breath, but caught myself in time. I didn’t want my mother knowing I was listening to the conversation.



“What the fuck are you saying?” my father spit out.



“She will have a weak wolf, if she gets a wolf at all. James had a good reason to reject her,” the Alpha said.



“That is my baby girl you are talking about,” my father growled. 



“You know I love her like a daughter, but we can’t hide from the truth.”



“The truth being that her wolf will come when it’s ready, and she is perfect just the way she is. Because that is what you have been telling her for the past two years, Mark,” my father told his friend. 



“Precisely. That doesn’t mean she is suitable to be Luna. You know the kind of responsibilities that come with that position.” I didn't hear my father’s reply as there was a knock on my bedroom door.







Chapter 3


 My mother got up to answer. 



“Melissa, I made some tea. How is she doing?” Luna Joy asked.



“Thank you, but I’m fine. She is holding on and being strong,” my mother said. There was a tone of dismissal in her voice. She was telling Luna she wasn’t welcome. 



“I was hoping to sit with her for a while. To see if I can’t be of some help or comfort,” Luna Joy said. 



“I don’t think that’s a good idea. Armeria needs her family at the moment.”



“Melissa,” Luna gasped. “I would like to think of myself as family. We have always been close since we mated Mark and Ron.”



“I would have said the same yesterday. But after what Ja…” There was a pause, as if my mother needed time to compose herself. “After what your son did to my baby, I think we need to rethink certain things. I need to protect Armeria and put her first. We both know how this will affect her. We both know the pack won’t give her the same protection they would give someone rejected by a wolf who isn’t the future Alpha, would get. The least I can do is make sure she is around the right people.”



“I love her like a daughter,” Luna objected.



“But not enough to fight for her right to become your daughter by mating. Joy, you are my Luna and I will respect and obey you in all but this. My daughter is out of bounds for anyone in your family from this day,” my mother said and the door to my room closed. I felt the bed dip as my mother sat down and continued to stroke my hair. In the middle of all my pain, I felt the love from my parents and it soothed some of it. At least two people in this world loved me. But it also made me sad. Because of me, they were now at odds with their closest friends, their Alpha pair. This wouldn’t just affect our two families. If the Alpha and Beta couple were in conflict, that would have an impact on the whole pack. And even though my brother had chosen James, I wanted to pretend he had struggled with the decision before making it. It seemed like I was making everyone’s lives more complicated. As I couldn’t sleep, and I didn’t want my mother to think I was awake, I spent the rest of the night thinking. By the time my brother arrived back home after the sun had risen, I had reached a decision. During the early morning hours, I relaxed a little and let go of my knees. I heard my brother get home, walk upstairs and open the door to my room. My knees drew up to my chest again. 



“How is she?” Elder asked our mother. 



“Enduring. Your father needs to speak with you. We need to find a way to protect your sister,” she said. 



“I’ll go and talk to him. After I can sit with her so you can rest,” he offered. I didn’t want him to sit with me. I knew my brother’s betrayal wasn’t big in the grand scheme of things. But at the moment my heart and soul were raw, like they both had got a sunburn that meant even a tiny speck of sand felt like agony when rubbing against it. 



“I’m fine. I will stay with her until she wakes up,” mother said. I was eternally grateful to her. I heard my brother go downstairs, and I heard enough of his conversation with our father to know they were discussing if sending me away to another pack would be a good solution. After a while, I stopped listening. The conversation only confirmed what I already knew. I was causing problems for my family. I didn’t have a wolf and therefore I had become a burden. It was up to me to solve all the problems I had created. I turned around and looked at my mother. She smiled down at me and let her hand caress my cheek. I didn’t have it in me to smile back, but I turned into her hand. 



“My brave and strong daughter, we will get you through this and you will dazzle the world,” she told me, and kissed my forehead. If I could have smiled, I would have. My mother was amazing and my insides burned with the guilt that I was causing so much problems for her. I just nodded. “Are you hungry?” she asked, but I shook my head. Instead, I reached out my arms towards her, like I had done when I was little. She gave me a sad smile and drew me into a long hug. Then I lay back down, this time facing the door. My mother continued to sit with me. It didn’t take long for the door to open and my father to come inside. He looked so tired it almost made me cry all over again. 



“Hey, pumpkin, your mom told me you were up. Want me to make you some of my famous spaghetti?” he asked as he kneeled by my bed so he could look me in the eyes. My father’s famous spaghetti was just boiled noodles with cut up hotdogs and lots of ketchup. My dad couldn’t cook to save his life, but on days my mom needed a break from cooking or was away, he made us his spaghetti. Both me and Elder loved it as it was something my mother would never let us eat. It became our comfort food in a way. I just shook my head. “Okay, baby girl. It will all be okay. I will make it okay,” he said and kissed me on my head. A single tear ran down my cheek. I knew he meant it. He would stop at nothing to make sure I was happy again. It was up to me to make sure he didn’t have to. Elder came into my room as well. The look he gave me told me how sorry he was for me. 



“I can sit with her for a while,” he offered again. I saw my mother start to object, but I put my hand on hers and nodded. 



“Are you sure? I don't mind staying,” she said. I just nodded. 



“Okay, pumpkin. I will make sure your mother gets some rest. But we will be back in two hours and we will bring food. I’m expecting you to eat. Okay?” my father asked. I nodded. “Good girl.” I got a kiss from both of them on my head before they left. Elder took my mother’s place on the bed. 



“I don’t know what to do,” he said. I looked up at him and saw the swirl of emotions in his eyes. He must feel so torn and like being pulled in all directions. His love for me, his loyalty to family, his best friend, the future he had envisaged and trained for, the loyalty to the pack and to his alpha. They were all tugging at him. I took his hand and squeezed it. Tears ran down his face. “Look at me, here I am supposed to comfort you and I’m the one bawling my eyes out and you are the one comforting me,” he sniffed. I sat up and kissed his cheek. He was a good brother, even if he had his flaws. “I wish I could change his mind, that I could make him see what an idiot he is. The Gods know I have tried, but it’s like he is obsessed with strength. I can’t even get him to see there are different strengths. That you possess so many of them, even if you don’t possess the physical kind,” he told me. I understood then where he had been all night. He hadn’t forsaken me for James. It was the first time since the rejection I felt a small piece of warmth. I hugged him and we sat like that until I noticed the subtle change in his body and looked at him. He was mindlinking with someone and I could guess who. When they were done I nudged him to get up. “No, Amie, I’m staying,” he objected. I just shook my head and pushed him harder. “Okay, okay. I’ll go. I’ll just wake dad,” he said. 



‘No. Let him sleep, he is tired. I’m just going to go back to sleep anyway. I’ll be fine,’ I mindlinked him. 



‘Are you sure?’ he answered me.



‘I am. Thank you for staying with me.’ He gave me a hug and then left. As soon as I heard his footsteps leave the garden, I listened to make sure my parents were asleep. I got up and took out a backpack. I filled it with some clothes, some things that were most precious to me, and sneaked down into the kitchen to ransack the pantry, stuffing it into a separate bag. I put the two bags into my car and went back to the house, trying to be as quiet as I could. It was my speciality. Even without a wolf, I was good at sneaking around. I took the blanket my mother had knitted me and sat down to write a note. I starred on the blank page forever. There was so much I wanted to write, things that should be said in person and not written down on paper. But I knew if I waited for my parents to awake, they would never let me leave. 



*‘Dear mom, dad and Elder.



I love you all so much and I know you love me. That is why I need to leave. I can’t let you destroy your friendships and standing in the pack for me. Know that I see how much you love me by your actions and know that I will always carry that knowledge in my heart and honour it. 



Please don’t be angry with the Alpha family, please don’t destroy something that is so important to all of you. I will leave so I can find a new life and so you can live yours as it was intended. Please don’t try to find me, you have raised me well and I will be fine. I love you always.



With Love.



//A’*



I left the note on my bed with my set of house keys. Then I made my way downstairs and took a storm kitchen and a tent out of our storage. Making sure everything I needed was in the glove department in the car, I took a last look at the house that had been my home for eighteen years and I drove off. 







Chapter 4


I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw how exhausted and sad I looked. I tried to brighten up as I got close to the pack border. The wolves manning the booth knew my car by sight and just gave me a little wave as I drove by. No doubt they had seen or heard what had happened, I thought. Usually when I left the pack territory I got a feeling of longing. It was a physical reaction that let you know you were leaving your pack. This time, I felt lighter as the miles between me and the pack steadily increased. I headed into the closest town that had everything I needed. First stop was the bank. I was eighteen now and I withdrew all my savings I had earned from working in the pack’s sawmill, all the birthday money I had saved over the years and, with a heavy heart, the savings account my parents had started when I was born. All in all it gave me a good sum of money. Enough to let me stay on the road for as long as I had planned and still have some over for a clean start somewhere else. The next stop was the car dealership. The car I had was a gift from my parents when I got my driver licence. It was a little over a year old and had rarely been driven. But it was an electric car, not ideal for long, cross country road trips. I traded it in for a Volvo that was a little older, but looked to be in good condition. I transferred all my belongings into my new car and got back on the road. I wasn’t trying to hide, or to disappear, but on the other hand I wasn’t going to announce to the world where I was going either. That could be because I had no clue. My plan was to get as far away from Verginia as I could. 



I had been driving for most of the day and I felt the exhaustion in my bones. I hadn’t slept since the previous night and I knew I would soon be a danger to myself and others on the road. I found a small gravel road leading into a dead end in the middle of a dense forest. I stopped there, warmed a can of soup and forced myself to eat it even though I had no appetite. I then shut myself in the car, made myself as comfortable as I possibly could with my blanket wrapped around me. My family would have found the note hours ago, and I wondered what they were doing. I cried myself to sleep. 



The days were all the same. I drove as far as I could. I stopped to get gas, food and use the bathroom. Once in a while, I slept in cheap motels so I could shower. But most of the time, I slept in my car or outside under the stars. The only thing changing in my routine was the landscape outside the car. From lush forests to grasslands, to desserts and finally I found myself on the other side of the country. I parked my car by the side of the road and stepped out, ending up in the middle of a grass field of flowers. On the other end of the field there was a dense forest, and far in the distance tall mountains stretched up towards a summer blue sky. I drew in a deep breath and some of the tension I had carried with me for almost two weeks left me. Somewhere along the way, I had come up with a goal: Oregon. There was only one pack in the state and they had their territory on the border to Nevada. If I stayed in the northern parts of the state, I would most likely never run into a werewolf. I was going lone wolf. It was the best thing for someone like me, I had decided. Since I didn’t have a wolf, I had no urge to shift. I could blend into the human society without too much trouble. That would also minimise the risk of running into other wolves. They tended to keep away from humans if at all possible. I needed to find a job and some place to live, preferably before winter. But that gave me at least two months. I could do it. It would get my mind off the throbbing ache in my chest. It wasn’t as sharp of a pain as it had been the first couple of days, but it didn’t go away. It was just a constant reminder of what I had lost and why I now needed to prepare for a life as a lone wolf. A lone wolf was not the same as a rogue. The werewolf society had shunned a rouge. Often because of a crime they had committed. A rogue could be killed by anyone, anytime. A lone wolf was a werewolf who had decided not to live in a pack. They still lived by the laws of the werewolf world and if they came across other wolves, they respected the built in hierarchy. It was just as bad to kill a lone wolf without cause as a member of a pack. But finding someone who cared enough to call someone out for doing it, on the other hand, would be difficult. A lone wolf could also re-enter the pack life without permissions from anyone other than the pack that accepted them in. A rogue could only become a member of a pack if they had the permission from the council or from the pack that made them rogue. I took out my new phone, I had sent my old phone back to my parents as it was on their plan. Now I had a new, cheaper one with a prepaid SIM-card. I pulled up a map of the state and started scrolling over it. I decided to head north-west and see where it would take me. 



Two days later it took me into a sleepy little town. It looked to be the backdrop for one of those Hallmark-movies my mother loved. The main street was lined with two-story buildings with shops on the bottom floor. The town was located where the plains met the forest and had the towering mountains in the background. The air was clear and the town seemed filled with happiness and joy. This was a place where I could heal, I thought. As if faith and the gods agreed with me, I saw a sign for help wanted in the window of the local diner. I walked inside and could smell the mouthwatering combination of the different traditional diner meals. 



“Hey miss, can I get you something?” an older lady asked me as I got close to the counter. 



“Hi, yes, I saw the sign in the window and wondered if you are still looking for someone?” I asked. The woman stopped what she was doing and looked at me.



“Are you over eighteen?” 



“Yes, ma’am.”



“Run away from home?”



“No ma’am,” I lied.



“Graduated high school?” she asked. This wasn’t going the way I had hoped.



“No, ma’am. But not far off. There was this thing that happened and my family…,” I stopped talking and looked down at my hands. 



“I’m sorry dear,” she said with a heavy sigh, and I realised she had got the wrong impression. But I didn’t correct her. “I’ll give you a trial period of a month. If it works out, I’ll give you permanent employment. But, if you work here I want you to study for a GED. That’s not negotiable,” she said. 



“Yes, ma’am. Thank you. I will make sure to work and study hard,” I told her. She chuckled. 



“That’s good dear. Call me Mrs Jones, everyone around here does. What is your name?” she asked.



“I’m Amie Sage, nice to meet you,” I said, using my nickname and my mother’s maiden name. 



“Well Amie, if you are planning on sticking around, do you have a place to live?” she asked. 



“Not yet. I saw a motel on the outskirts of the town. I was thinking of staying there until I found something.”



“Don’t do that. It’s not in the best condition. Tell you what. My sister owns the bakery a couple of houses down. She owns the apartment on top of it as well. Her last tenant just moved out because she got married and my sister hasn’t been able to find anyone new to rent to yet. How about the two of us walk over and I’ll introduce the two of you,” Mrs Jones said. 



“Thank you. That is so nice of you,” I said. This was turning out better than I expected. 



Two days later, I was moving into the apartment. It didn’t have much in the ways of furniture. But Mrs Andresen, Mrs Jones’ sister, gave me a tip on two good second hand stores in the area. I had started my job as a waitress in the diner the day before. Everyone has been so nice to me. It almost felt like being part of a new pack. The diner mostly had local guests, patrons that came in regularly to order the same food and to exchange gossip. Mrs Jones explained they got tourists during peak season. It was everything I had dreamed of and needed. 







Chapter 5


**Four years later.**



I walked into the backdoor of the bakery, put down the two bags of flour and got a kiss on the cheek from Mrs Andersen. 



“Thank you, Amie. I don’t know what I would do without you,” she happily told me. 



“I’m happy to help,” I said, and it was the truth. The two sisters had been good to me these past four years. They had helped me feel at home in the small town, introduced me to all the right people, according to them, and made sure I got out of my apartment for other things than my work. In return, I gladly offered them a hand with some of the heavier work. The sisters were getting older, and I felt bad for them working so hard. My strength was nowhere near that of a full werewolf, but I was stronger than the average human. I had made peace with being a latent wolf; a werewolf who didn’t have a wolf, or where the wolf was so weak, it didn’t manifest. It made it easier for me to live amongst humans. 



“I have a treat for you on the counter over there,” Mrs Anderson told me.



“You didn’t have to, thank you,” I said before I sank my teeth into a still lukewarm danish and sighed with joy.



“Seeing you eat my pastries is a delight,” the older woman said with a warm smile. We did this every morning. I would bring her the flour from the storage, she would give me a treat and some of her amazing coffee and I insisted she didn’t need to, and she insisted she did. 



“I have the lunch shift so I’ll be back before it gets dark,” I told her as I left, holding the to-go cup of coffee. 



“Have a nice day dear, and maybe say yes if Jessie asks you out again?” I heard before the door shut behind me. Jessie was the town’s most desirable bachelor, not that it said much in this town. But he had been the highschool football star. He was good looking, hardworking, owned his own farm that actually made a profit and was, overall, a decent guy. Jessie had tried hitting on me since I arrived four years ago, but unlike the local women, I turned him down. Not just the first time, but every time since. It had become a running joke in town, and I knew people were placing bets on when I would finally give in. The thing with Jessie was that he never took offense at me turning him down. He joked about it just as much as anyone else and over the years, we had become good friends. As I walked into the diner, I was greeted by Rich, the cook, and Mrs Jones. I emptied the last coffee from my cup, careful not to spill anything on my mint-green uniform. 



“CeCe is marrying the ketchups. Could you start with the napkins?” Mrs Jones asked. 



“Sure thing,” I said as I walked out into the front part of the diner to greet my other friend. Yes, during my time in this town, I had only made two real friends. But that was two more than I had expected. CeCe was a year older than me and more upbeat than I had ever been. Usually there was only one waitress needed at the time in the diner. But it was tourist season, which meant we would be two. It also meant we had to take in a third, temporary, waitress as CeCe and I couldn’t cover all shifts. It sucked as this year we were stuck with Dara. Dara wasn’t a bad kid, she was just clumsy, unfocused and lived more in her own head than out in the real world. To be honest, she usually caused more work than she helped. But Mrs Jones said Dara needed to get out of the house and into the real world. She had a thing for rescuing people, like some old women rescued stray cats, Mrs Jones rescued stray people. I couldn’t object as she had rescued me. She had rescued CeCe as well, but in a different kind of way. We were both loyal to the old woman, so we didn’t object to having Dara in the diner. 



“Am I happy to see you,” CeCe said as I walked up to her. We hugged and got back to work. 



“How was your trip?” she asked as we got going. 



“It was fine,” I said. It had been my day off yesterday and I had told everyone I was going to go away for the day, sightseeing and relaxing. What I was really doing was driving as far away as I could possibly get and still make it back home to my shift today. It was my mother’s birthday in a couple of days and that meant I sent a postcard to her. I usually just said I was doing well and I hoped she had a good birthday. I did the same for my father’s and brother’s birthdays, as well as for the end of the lunar cycle. It’s like Christmas and new years all wrapped into one for werewolves. I drove to remote towns so the postage couldn’t 



“Have you seen the hunk who just sat down at your table?” CeCe asked me. We were in the middle of the lunch rush and the diner was full of both locals and tourists. I glanced over at the table I knew she had to be referring to, as it had been the

This is translated on google too keep in mind I'm going to tell the world about what I went through in the past about invisible people who abused me mentally, which made my morale very destroyed. In short, it's really hard for me to find all their insults towards me. They ruined my life by harassing me, stalking me, making death threats with several, slandering many others... I couldn't have a normal life like others, if I got what I wanted in life it was something else entirely better. My life started very hard but also very wonderful until I met a man... My father died before I met him. Right now I feel like I'm being followed by other invisible entities/ghosts - (invisible people) at this moment when I'm writing this text... Going back to what I was saying, my father had died, and I was 13 years old. My mother started taking me to a psychologist and psychiatrist at the children's hospital in the city where I live for neuropsychiatric illnesses I had pills to take for depression and anxiety several traumatic shocks and among them psychosis Psychosis was the worst for me, when it started I would hear people next to me whispering but in fact they weren't talking, I struggled with it really bad because I didn't realize at first what I had was a big problem in my head I felt like everyone had something on me, that they were cursing me and at first I couldn't realize if this was in my head and then I started telling the world what I kept repeating and everyone thought I had serious problems with my head. And I even realized that I was going to find out that even the doctors were telling me it was a mental illness. After I started to feel like I could feel my father, I know that the dead can be with you, that they watch over you and anyone up there, and that they are with you and that they can stay on earth for three days. I also had a dream with him in which he said goodbye to me… I was in his bed and he came to kiss me on the head. I love my father very much and now, I started to smell the flowers from the wake, I was with my grandmother at that moment, my grandmother being my father's mother. And after I started to feel him, I started to see shadows in the house and children running and shouting in the hallway of the house. After a while, I had sex with that man, it's too much to tell. I ended up telling a friend my age about what I had done and with whom, and she told me to tell an adult. I thought I made a bad choice at that age so I told my mother and she filed a big complaint first to the police… I ended up in the prosecutor’s office and finally in court. Many years passed before I was in court with that man. Before he even went to court he started following me and you know he became invisible at the end of the story. And this thing lasted about 2 or 3 years… I don’t know for sure

He started coming to the block of flats where my mother and I lived. To stay with a woman/girl/his mistress, I mean we had a basement in the block and they would hide there and probably stay until I came to see them. Of course I would run away from them… so they wouldn’t catch me or something the first time… I was pretty shocked. He was disguised like in Harry Potter style, like a gypsy or like Batman. That is, in a black cape, black hat with a very long peak, like a similar helmet (sorcerer), with some slippers like gypsies wear, I think he had so long that they reached his head :)) and with a huge mustache. The first day of starting came to the floor where I was staying and he knocked on the door, as if I felt that someone was going to come and that it was him, as if I felt that moment, I already knew that something bad was happening. I realized that he was the cause and the face was his feature, his smile was quite big ... and especially when he started talking to me telepathically, I felt when I looked through the door peephole a great connection between the two of us and I thought that it wasn't true what was happening to me, I had a shock when I heard his voice in my head, suddenly he started to play the trick that he would sell me perfumes or if I could open the door for him.

I asked him: But do you really think you would have a chance of me opening your door? Even in that state would you think I would open the door for you? Have you come to believe me that stupid? . You will realize what plan he had in his head then, to let him maybe kill me, steal me or make me want to have sex with him again. However, that man no longer had all the tiles on the house then. So I did not open anything to me even though I wanted to know the secret of this mystery, even though he quickly left the stairs as if he was nervous, he made a big mistake in his life that I will never forget and I will not understand why he was so crazy to do this. And then he started following me more and more. He was not alone, it all started with his mistresses, his wife had also come, young or older men and at the end with a group of bikers. I don't want to give more details about this man, except that he liked to have fun with several women... and other sexual fantasies. Since then he came to enter the house to appear in my room invisibly, he stared at me a lot and spoke suspiciously next to me then I imagined telling him to make noise, that is, to step so that he could be heard, sometimes the parquet creaked by itself or even heard as if someone was there. I don't remember for sure if he ever dropped an object or not, the same way with his phone he could control me on everything, they kept laughing at my songs, put songs on by himself or exit the application to type the pin by himself or just open it to see what time it was. When he followed me with his black motorbike at night or when the sun rose, early in the morning around 6 o'clock, it seemed like an hour representing something to him repeatedly and I seemed to wake up an hour and a half before or a few minutes before he had come all over the city and my neighborhood/front of the block. It was like I felt him coming... I had already gotten used to knowing when he was coming like on the first day. The TV in the living room kept popping and popping but I know that this is something normal that the radiator is heating up or something like that but it started to be too often, I don't know how to explain it and when I ate a bag of snacks or chips they would rustle on their own very loudly I know it could be from the draft in the room or the windows, but they weren't. I think if you document yourself about this supernatural power/paranormal ability, to be invisible plus teleport through walls/doors/windows… Think about building a building, … Now we are in the year 2025, science has advanced chemistry, and religion seems quite important to me. Look at mysticism, shamanism, even satanic rituals, there are a lot of myths about these beliefs. I am really fascinated by the astral side of witchcraft to believe that this paranormal exists and maybe some of you too. I'm not an expert now in explaining more to make you understand that I lived then it was quite complicated to convince a person to help me find out about that man that he is invisible and the others and yes I know how to do it now today the difference between that psychosis/trauma and what I had with invisible people is totally different from what I had, I don't want to confuse reality and illusion. When I was in the house all the time they could give me a negative energy and when they got to put their hands on me it wasn't like when a person put it, not like a tickle, like when you put a feather or a caress but it felt very light. One night I was going to sleep and some bandits (men/friends) came to push a strong and painful energy into my stomach area and back in such a way that I fell out of bed. But I remained stiff, crying. I was thinking to get up with my face or something, I was scared. It's hard to believe, right?

The other night his wife started coming with a man with a Glovo backpack, he entered the apartment building, then he was standing right by the door asking me, what am I doing?

FOO-FOO (my nickname) - from a Kendrick Lamar song I listen to music on my headphones.

It was interesting that he was standing in the dark… and staring at the viewfinder

I was telling him to go away. (telepathy) After they both ran to a white car, it was pretty ugly outside, rainy weather

He told the man that I'm staying here, I don't know who that was. He just looked very strange and a bit heavy.

It started like the other day he came to draw on the wall of the ground floor apartment building me sitting in bed with the duvet on, showing that on the walls of my room there were some stripes like sun rays or electricity or to look like some red radiation in the room… most likely me with short curly hair because he didn't like the way I looked They were making fun of me, along with the young men/lovers of the alley and the husband.

I had started to see visions with other people who were talking about something but I can't remember exactly. They were probably friends of theirs

In the last two years, as I said, bikers had come Some only with sports engines, others with Harleys, others bikerdrummer and one and the most important with vests but I don't think they were from a known group (no name) I couldn't find them on the net in the city. Although they were making a special scandal in front of my block with him. Yes, he told him he was BattMan etc. I only know the teacher who was at the driving school and a few friends who were riding those vehicles. And I was in the bathroom screaming with sadness, I realized that they felt the emotion in my suffering body and they started to rev the same speed and brake and so on until their wheels were worn out, their vehicles could be heard throughout the neighborhood. Big fuss for nothing…. He was trying to show me how strong he was and how dangerous he was and how perfect he was, he was very proud of himself, it wasn't fair to me at all…. Thinking about it, I didn't agree with him doing that at all. So I was thinking about how it would be to show him how nervous I was by imagining lightning in the sky and a storm coming, the rain in the sea... I was starting to have a pretty good imagination, it seemed to me that it was developing, as if I were in reality, I had 3D glasses and I really didn't make a mistake. I told myself that even when I prayed to God to hear me say as it rained, ""May my tear be like a drop of rain, and when lightning falls from the sky, may it fall on you."" At that moment I realized that I was really making myself heard by That Zeus and by him. Because another day when I was outside, it was still raining and there was a storm, a lightning bolt appeared near me, almost hitting me. He told me that I had made him a little angry... I started looking at them to take pictures of some of them, especially him, to have proof that they were harassing me, but then I realized that they were not clear because they were on motorbikes, I couldn't take pictures because they were driving too fast... I couldn't find them at the gas stations in town either. A while had passed and I had left the house again and when they looked at me, they would back away or turn left or right, that is, they were avoiding me, as if they were afraid of me. me. And they made me feel really scared and in turn I felt like thinking bad about them too. It was like I felt like taking revenge on them, through the same method with that storm as he had started to do. You will realize that I had no other way. At the end of the story some of the mistresses appeared with a black car shouting after me or swearing Hey kitty What are you doing On the last day that man had come (meaning the invisible man who destroyed my soul, abused my life who wanted to make me lose my mind and life)

so I could see him something like that with a black car he was in an unbuttoned white shirt, he was looking at me with wide eyes, I had not seen him for a long time he looked surprised and without the will to live, he was drinking from a coffee",1,1743171294.0,Ghoststories,0,0.99,False
1jlw24q,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasonJars/comments/1jlw24q/looking_for_metal_30_mesh_or_higher_lids_to/,"Looking for metal, 30 mesh or higher lids to filter cold brew coffee","I am looking for food-safe metal lids with a mesh size of 30 or higher (ie 40, 50, etc the higher the number the finer the filter). I have found many on Amazon but they don't specific the mesh size, other than ""fine"" or some other non-specific term.

I want to use them for making cold brew. My understanding is that cold brew grounds are usually 800 microns large or larger, and 20 mesh will filter out 800 microns. I want 30 to err on the side of caution.

I know there are other solutions such as

* coffee socks
* filters that fit inside the jar are contain the grounds (see [this example](https://www.amazon.com/Filter-Coffee-UPGRADED-Stainless-Silicone/dp/B084JF1X2R?th=1))
* pour the coffee from the mason jar through a filter like a chinois strainer, paper filter, etc. 

I don't like the coffee sock because it's more complicated to clean and will not last forever. I don't like the filters that fit in the jar because I believe restraining the grounds inside a filter like that will produce inferior cold brew. I don't like pouring from the mason jar through another filter because that will be more messy (eg I have to ensure the grounds don't overflow the filter)

I know I'm being very picky here. If there are other solutions I haven't considered please let me know!",2,1743171271.0,MasonJars,2,1.0,False
