But one factor which I think is hugely underrated is what you've been eating (or not eating).

Like, I find that the same beans made the same way with my Switch will taste RADICALLY different depending on what I've had for breakfast. The most marked difference comes if I don't have breakfast. On those days, the coffee tends to taste pretty flat and lacking in brightness and juiciness, probably because my palate hasn't opened up. 

But on the days where I do have breakfast (particularly if contains fat, such as scrambled eggs or smoked salmon), the clarity of the coffee just seems to shoot up! Anyway just thought I'd splurge out these thoughts because it only just occurred to me. I guess it's similar to how wine can taste way better or way duller depending on what we eat, but that's a universally-acknowledged aspect of wine, whereas with coffee it doesnt tend to be talked about from what I can see.",3,1740831103.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1j0xy64,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForexForALL/comments/1j0xy64/overtrading_after_a_loss_how_to_break_the_cycle/,Overtrading After a Loss – How to Break the Cycle,"Let’s be honest, we’ve all been there. You take a loss, frustration kicks in, and suddenly you’re clicking buttons like a maniac trying to “win it back.” Next thing you know, your account balance looks like a slow-motion car crash. 

Overtrading after a loss is one of the fastest ways to blow your account. But don’t worry—let’s break down why it happens and how to stop the madness.

# Why Overtrading Happens After a Loss 

Emotional Revenge – You feel like the market “owes” you a win.  
Impulse Trading – Instead of waiting for setups, you force trades.  
Desperation Mode – You want to recover losses ASAP, so you increase position size.  
Lack of a Cooldown Period – No time to reset, just straight back into battle.

# Common Mistakes Traders Make (And How to Fix Them!)

Mistake #1: Taking random trades just to make back losses  
Solution: Stick to your trading plan. If the setup isn’t valid, don’t take it—no exceptions!

Mistake #2: Increasing lot size after a loss to “make it back faster”  
Solution: Keep your risk consistent. The bigger your position, the bigger the emotional rollercoaster.

Mistake #3: Jumping into a trade immediately after a stop-out  
Solution: Step away for 15-30 minutes after a loss. Go for a walk, grab coffee, do anything but trade!

Mistake #4: Thinking one trade defines your success  
Solution: Think in probabilities. Even pro traders lose 40-50% of the time, but they win in the long run by managing risk.

# How to Stop Overtrading & Stay Disciplined 

Set a max daily loss limit – If you hit it, shut the charts down. No “just one more trade.”  
Use a trade checklist – If the trade doesn’t meet your criteria, it’s a no-go.  
Take a break after 2-3 losses – Trading when emotional = bad decisions. Walk away, reset.  
Journal every trade – Seeing your overtrading habits written down will force accountability.

# Final Thought 

One loss doesn’t define your trading career, but overtrading after a loss can destroy it. The best traders accept losses, stick to their plan, and trade with discipline.

Additionally, he has a bipolar wife that harasses me through various platforms and profiles.

So this is not the end of the world, but it does piss me off as I have not really done anything to cause this situation: hence venting out of frustration and the whole illogicality of the situation.

Background:
I’ve been in the same clan for 5 years and at times I have been the co-leader. 2 years ago two guys (M22 and M23) picked up the game and joined our clan, which we promote as a helpful/low threshold community. It is exactly the altruistic and friendly atmosphere, which has made me stick, even at times when I can’t play much. 

Initially I didn’t interact with them much, but I got to know them through weekly group events. July 2023 we had a clan get together for everyone who could make it IRL and I met both of them there. Let’s call the married guy Alex and the single friend John. I got along super well with them, I had the most fun I’ve had in years, just talked about specific raids and fails and such. It was also the first time we discussed anything personal. Alex told me he is married and has 3 kids. He is unemployed because of anxiety, which is why he smokes weed and plays most of the day. I don’t judge, but it doesn’t sound like a fun life imo. John on the other hand is a mechanic, single, lives alone, works out most days, doesn’t drink or do drugs: which is exactly the same way as I am. Both of us have been single for a few years and are not interested in situationships. 

I gave John my snap and last year we have met a few times for a coffee. Somehow Alex always tags along. However, we live far away from each other and although we engage in innocent flirting, we expressed not progressing as neither want a long-distance relationship. Since the coffee “dates” Alex has become more irritable every time we play as a group. Sometimes he intentionally lies to John saying I’m not online (I play offline but clan member can see me). Additionally, Alex’s wife has started messaging me through her own profile, his profiles and fake profiles. Occasionally she screams in the background asking if he is playing with me. 

I’ve told her this is unnecessary drama I am not interested in your HUSBAND and the FATHER of your kids. I said I am however interested in his best friend. Nevertheless, she has kept harassing me and calling me names. Other clan members want him out because of her behaviour. John though is a happy go lucky guy and said (jokingly) she will shut up once we marry. 

It so happens that John is moving only an hour away from me in 3 months. He said he hates to be obnoxious but could I possibly reserve a date for him and perhaps “wait for him”. I thought that was incredibly cute and I said of course. I rarely play anymore as I just started doing my PhD in October and I spend long hours at a lab or I am just tired after gym. I only login Friday/Saturday evenings.

They are still best friends but I feel that they won’t be once he moves as John doesn’t really like either of their behaviour. He told me she has bipolar, which adds to Alex’s misery as she is very jealous and paranoid. I just wish we could all get along as I don’t see an issue here: I’m pursuing a single man.

Anyway. Had to get this off my chest as their crazy behaviour is making me want to login less and it is my only quality time with John at the moment until he will move. He has asked not to kick Alex out of the clan as “he doesn’t have much going for him”. I get that, but hey, I was there first.

This is all frivolous I get it, but it does piss me off regardless.

And within that, Porsche stands out as one of the most iconic brands that unites enthusiasts in a way few others can. 

POWSCHE Capitalizes on this

Whether it’s a local Cars & Coffee meet, a high-speed track day, or a late-night garage session wrenching on a project car, Porsche has created a global community of passionate drivers. It’s not just about the cars themselves—it’s about the shared experience, the respect for engineering, and the love for the drive.

Car culture is one of the biggest and most diverse niches in the world. From JDM fans (VTEC BWAAAAAAAP) to muscle car lovers (Nothing wrong with liking dudes) to hypercar collectors, there’s something for everyone. But Porsche has a unique way of bringing people together. 

The real magic happens when you see strangers become friends over a shared love for a brand, when generations pass down their passion for cars, and when people from completely different walks of life bond over the roar of a flat-six.

POWSCHE has found a way to tokenize this culture, and create one of the most promising meme coins for the foreseeable future.

It doesn't end there, the DEV team is constantly innovating, and creating utility projects to benefit the holders of $POWSCHE. Join the Powsche TG and see for yourself!

1j0xvi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1j0xvi5/possibly_divorcing_due_to_me_leaving_the_church/,Possibly divorcing due to me leaving the church,"TLDR: I think my mixed faith marriage is leading to divorce. How did you know to get divorced due to mixed faith marriage issues?
-
Hey everyone. For those of you who ended up divorced because you stopped believing in the church but your spouse didn’t, and either one or both of you decided it wouldn’t work, how did that go? What was that experience/process like for you? Did your spouse ask for divorce? Or did you? And why? If it was you, how did you know you should get divorced?

For some context, I think my mixed faith marriage (no kids yet) is heading to divorce. Which really scares me and breaks my heart. We were high school sweethearts, so between that and marriage (and the mission) we’ve been together for 7 years. We’re both each other’s first and only partners. He knows me inside and out, and we have always been best friends. 

My shelf broke a year ago, and I told him when it happened. I’ve been pimo ever since. My family knows, but his doesn’t, and I only just told a few of my friends last week. He really doesn’t want to tell his family bc they’ll make it a huge deal (they are super TBM, and my husband is also very TBM). I’ve understood that and honestly didn’t want to deal with their shit either, but I’m so tired of pretending. I want to tell them, he said not yet. I think he’s hoping I’ll believe again and he’ll just never have to tell them.

Anyway. I’ve been trying so hard to give him time to adjust. But I don’t want to be pimo anymore. I’m tired of hiding it. This has led to more frequent discussions with him and talking about our future. His main way of coping with all this over the past year has been to simply avoid it and not talk about and pretend it doesn’t exist, unless I bring something up.

He’ll get distant after our discussions or if I do something very not Mormon like buy coffee. I’ve had 7 ear piercings for about a year and he still doesn’t like it. He doesn’t address it, except for when I like the earring stack I’ve put together and ask him if it’s pretty and he says he doesn’t like all those holes in my ears. I’ll wear a pretty but not garment compatible shirt on date night and he’ll compliment my eyes or something but not my outfit. I wear cute thongs but he still gets sad that I’m not wearing garments. He doesn’t like my temporary tattoos, and has cried anytime I bring up wanting a real tattoo or new ear piercing. He doesn’t like when I swear. He doesn’t like that I’m bisexual or that I’ve come out to some people.

He thinks that it’s a choice to believe in the church. I told him I can choose to go thru all the churchy motions but I can’t force and choose a testimony. He says yes I can, bc that’s what faith is for. He says it’s not fair of me bc we went into this marriage expecting to both be lds. He views it as a betrayal that I’m choosing. He says he never would’ve married me if I wasn’t lds, which is understandable, but still hurts. I tell him I’m willing to put in the work to make a mixed faith marriage work, and that I’ll support him in his decision to be an active member. He says that’s not enough, that he wants a TBM wife. That he wants to raise his future kids in the gospel and be able to go to the temple with his wife. I told him that I’m doing the best I can to be a good person, and that if it turns out that the lds church is true, Jesus will forgive me and understand that I did my best. My husband says it doesn’t work that way, and that my best was when I believed in the church. He finds ways to justify everything horrible about the church, often reverting to “God has his reasons and will make everything work out later” and is very into following the prophet.

I literally just got him to agree to having weekly discussions about our faith. I need to be heard, but he doesn’t want to hear about it all the time so this is our compromise. We’re also starting therapy up again.

I had hoped that he would’ve adapted more and been willing to work on things with me over the past year. But we’ve hardly made any progress. I think it’s especially hard for him to change bc he was raised super TBM, and is the oldest child and has always had to set a good example. That and his patriarchal blessing warns him that people will try to attack his testimony, and that he is responsible for people leaving the church due to his bad example.

I know I’m making him sound horrible. But the thing is, he’s not. We don’t talk about any of this that often, and so most of the time things are so good. We love each other and have fun with each other and we help support each other and he handles my poor mental health pretty and neurodivergence really well. We know each other so so well. I can’t imagine life without him.

So, I’m really scared. And really sad. And I don’t know what to do. I’m willing to make mixed faith marriage work, but more and more I’m thinking that he’s not. But he’s so smart and so kind, I keep hoping that one day he’ll see that the church isn’t true. I don’t want to give up on us if in another few years he also leaves the church or is at least willing to adapt to a mixed faith marriage. But I’m scared that I might have to leave, be it by my own choice or by his.

After Saiki accompanied Toritsuka to the forest because of strange rumors, with an offering of coffee jellies, it turns out that they found the source of the rumors. The Yokais!

It turns out that they do exist, and that the reason Toritsuka didn't see them is because of Saiki, but now there is a tiny problem. The energy clash between Saiki and the Yokai caused Saiki to transform into a Yokai!

* Saiki can switch between human mode and yokai mode.
* The reason why Toritsuka never saw any Yokai is because of Saiki's aura, which is composed of 2 (known) parts. The inner part covers a radius of 200m and holds the highest concentration of energy, the outer part extends up to 90km and has less concentration of energy but keeps the Yokai away.

I'm 6'3, single, never married, no kids, and my new goal is to get to an absolutely shredded 225lbs in the next 6 months. 

**Diet - No restrictions**

I had access to reasonably healthy food and ate out every meal. Outside of a couple of protein bars or shakes each week, I didn't take any supplements and still went out for drinks 1-3x per week. 

Typical meals looked something like this: 

* **Breakfast:** 1-2 black coffees OR cappuccinos right regular milk, big bowl of fruit with peanut butter, almonds & peacans OR avocado toast with eggs over easy and side salad.
* **Snack #1:** coconut OR protein bar/shake
* **Lunch:** fish tacos
* **Snack #2:** frozen yogurt with berries
* **Dinner:** chicken tacos OR rotisserie chicken OR sushi/ceviche/shashami plate

It's worth mentioning that there were a couple of weeks where I didn't drink anything and honestly felt a lot healthier and saw a lot more progress in muscle tone, body composition, and gas tank during workouts.

**Work outs - Muay Thai & Weight Lifting** 

I trained Muay Thai 4-6x per week for 8 months straight, 90 minutes per session. I added weight lifting with a personal trainer 1-2x per week for 3 months, starting at the beginning of month 3, when I also wound up getting Dengue, which explains the 17.8lbs weight loss in October. 

I know that if I want to hit my new target weight, I'll probably have to take the drinking to 0 for a while, which I'm prepared to do. I'm a little anxious right now, however, since I'll be traveling for the next 6 months and don't have a good routine laid out for the first 6 weeks. Looking back, alcohol really determined my rate of progress month to month (less is more), but workout consistency is key. If I can find a HIIT gym, I should be okay until I step back into a decent Muay Thai gym again.

For example, I'm not interested in taking a bunch of supplements for specific issues - just the major ones that pretty much everyone should take.

This includes what Peter Attia, Huberman, David Sinclair, etc.. do for themselves.

What would you edit / add?

# 1 - Nutrition & Supplements

**Protein.**

* Peter Attia and Layne Norton recommend .8 - 1g of protein for 1 lb of body weight per day. This is a lot and hard to eat honestly.
* Attia estimates the max per sitting is around 50g (more than that and it’ll get shit out).
* Attia recommends whey protein isolate as opposed to whey protein concentrate. Whey protein concentrate has sugar alcohols which can give folks tremendous farts.
* Huberman's recommendations center around consuming 1g of protein per pound of body weight.
* Rhonda often discusses the benefits of consuming approximately 20-30g of protein per meal.

**Fiber.**

* Layne Norton recommends getting at least 35g of fiber for a 2,500 calorie diet, although he also states that the more fiber a day, the better.
* He cites that for every 10g increase in fiber, there was a 10% reduction in risk of mortality.
* Attia mentions fiber improves glucose and ApoB levels.
* Dr. Robert Lustig says it’s important to get both soluble and insoluble fiber in a sitting.
* There’s a big caveat though - if you supplement with too much fiber out the gate - and especially insoluble fiber - you can get some weapons-grade level gas.

**Fish oil.**

* DHA and EPA are two Omega 3 Fatty Acids in fish oil that have been shown to have a lot of cognitive and cardiovascular benefits, including longevity.
* eat fatty fish such as salmon, tinned sardines or mackerel with the skin on 
* take at least 1 gram of EPA derived from fish oil each day, or 2 grams of EPA if you’re not a fish eater. 
* The most cost effective way of supplementing that Huberman has mentioned is [Carlson’s fish oil](https://www.amazon.com/Carlson-Limited-Finest-Norwegian-Omega-3s/dp/B071Z9P4L5/ref=sr_1_7?crid=79QYX29KN5LM&keywords=carlsons+fish+oil&qid=1680980892&s=hpc&sprefix=carlson+fish+oil%2Chpc%2C92&sr=1-7) (sorry Momentous).
* [Dr. Rhonda Patrick](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/topics/omega-3) said to keep the bottle refrigerated if possible as room temperature will degrade the potency of the EPA + DHA, and if the bottle gets hot it can go rancid.
* Bryan Johnson is using vegan high strength Omega‑3 EPA and DHA - he mentioned using from [this brand.](https://www.vegetology.com/supplements/omega-3)

**Creatine.**

* A recent study came out showing that creatine supplementation helped old ladies strengthen their hips, decreasing their probability of falling and breaking a bone.
* For creatine you want creatine monohydrate.
* Folks under 180 lbs should shoot for 5g/day, everyday.
* Heavier folks often supplement up to 10g/day. This comes from [Dr. Layne Norton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD8-CJ6OuAQ).

**Alcohol.**

* Alcohol causes neurological decline, damages the gut microbiome, and increases stress levels when we’re not drinking.
* [Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=1s) advises against drinking more than 2 drinks a week (with 0 being ideal).
* [Attia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l-_c8kcfR4) advises the limit is up to 7.
* Both Huberman and Attia agree that anything over 2 drinks a day is supremely no bueno.

# 2 - Exercise

# Building Aerobic capacity

* **Zone 2 cardio for 150+ minutes.**
* Andy Galpin recommends performing all Zone 2 cardio should be performed while nasal breathing, as that’s somehow better for air quality and facial muscles.
* He recommends getting at least 150 minutes per week.
* Peter Attia has a much more specific definition. Zone 2 for him is the highest metabolic output/work that you can sustain while keeping your lactate level below two millimole per liter.
* This requires using a lactate meter periodically (he recommends 1x/month) immediately after workouts to see if you’re in range.
* Attia recommends 180 - 210 minutes of this a week.
* Andy Galpin recommends warming up for about 10 minutes, then going fast for 2 minutes then resting for 2 minutes, and repeating 3x.
* Huberman does 20-60 seconds of an all-out sprint + 10 seconds rest x 8-12 rounds.

# Strength / physical therapy training 

* **The key principle is progressive overload.**
* Every week, you want to do a bit more weight or reps than the week before.
* Galpin recommends adding 10% more weights or reps each week. After six weeks, he recommends down shifting by 30% to give muscles a rest, then slowly going up again.
* Bryan Johnson’s Complete Workout [(YouTube video here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYyVi-H-ozI)
* Hubberman optimizes strength and muscle growth by alternating between low-intensity (8-15 repetitions) and high-intensity (4-8 repetitions) training schedules.
* Tracking progress.
   * Use a Garmin, Whoop or Apple Watch to track your workout.
   * Strava, Notebook, or your note app to save your PR.
* [Fitness Routine Suggestion from Huberman](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64416928859cbdd1716d79ce/650e450994ef9ab775e16acf_Neural_Network_Newsletter_Foundational_Fitness_Protocol.pdf) - not recommended for beginners, but gives you an idea of what you might include in your own program.

# 3 - Sleep protocol

Deep Sleep. Aim for 75-90 minutes of deep sleep per night. Deep sleep is the most restorative stage of sleep. It’s more important than the amount of sleep you get.

* **Get enough magnesium.** Magnesium is essential for sleep. Include magnesium-rich foods in your diet or take a magnesium supplement.
* **Sleep environment:**
   * Keep your room cool and dark while sleeping.
   * Use earplugs.
* **Create a relaxing bedtime routine:** 1/2 hours before bed, wind down by avoiding screen time, reading, or taking a warm bath.
* **Avoid caffeine 8-10 hours before bedtime,** as it disrupts sleep.
* Alcohol close to bedtime will also disrupt sleep.
* **Naps are perfectly fine**; as long as they are kept under 90 minutes, they shouldn't disrupt your sleep cycle.
* Some experts recommend taking melatonin before bedtime. Melatonin is a hormone that helps to regulate sleep.

# 4 - Other protocols

* **Early morning sunshine:** Get 5 - 10 minutes of sunlight within 1 hour of waking up. Huberman recommendation.
* **Nasal breathing:** Breath through your nose as opposed to your mouth as much as possible. [Source is Huberman](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1557047992472940545?lang=en).
* **Coffee intake timing:** Delay drinking coffee until 90 minutes after you wake up. It will last longer and prevent crashes. [Source is Huberman](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1600178360390279169?lang=en).
* **Water intake.** Hydration rule of thumb: Throughout the day, drink half your bodyweight (in pounds) in ounces per day. So, 200 pounds → 100 ounces of water. Distribute this throughout the day.

Oh, and also to see if Korebi Dark Side has *any* redeeming qualities in a French press. Spoiler alert: It doesn’t.

Side note: I *deeply* regret buying this coffee and am currently speedrunning my way through it just to be rid of it.

Back to the experiment—I ground 15g of coffee at the 5th setting, and this masterpiece of a grinder generously gifted me 6g of fines. SIX. That’s almost half the batch reduced to coffee dust.

As for the French press test, well… let’s just say this coffee seems to have been *engineered* for milk-based drinks. Even then, it still manages to taste burnt, like someone overestimated how much roasting coffee actually needs.

Was anyone of you ever successful in having a more normal sleep pattern?
I myself go to sleep at 3am every night. It kinda is my normal sleeping time and it was like that  since childhood. I can force myself to get up earlier but it just isn't my nature and the moment I have the slightest possibility I go back staying awake until 3am again. I even had a DNA test which confirmed to an extent that I'm a night owl, delaying my rhythm by 2 hours. In reality it's more like 3-4 hours.

For those who stick to their natural sleeping pattern but still have to work normal hours: how do you manage excessive daytime sleepiness? Do you take prolonged naps in the afternoons? Coffee sadly isn't an option for me.
I have a read a bit about possible ways to manage DSPS but I'm more interested in your personal experience.

I’ve been using a Mahlkönig E65S GBW and a Sanremo You for about 18 months, and I’ve run into an issue I can’t quite figure out. Hoping someone here might have insights!

The Situation:

When I first set up the E65S GBW, I followed the zeroing procedure to ensure the finest setting (1 on the jog dial, 0.000mm on display) was as fine as possible.

Until December 2024, most of my beans were dialed in between 3 and 4.5 on the jog dial (0.080 - 0.120mm on display), yielding a 2:1 ratio in ~30 seconds.

After returning in January 2025, I suddenly had to grind at 6.5 or higher (0.160mm+ on display, max is 8) to get the same extraction time and ratio, using the same beans.

What I’ve Checked So Far:

- Grinder cleaned thoroughly by taking it apart (I do the same procedure every 4/6 weeks) – no visible issues.
- Pump pressure on the You display shows 9 bar, but I’m wondering if this reading is accurate.
- Tried new bags of coffee from different brands, no changes. 

The questions now...

Coffee still tastes good, but this grind shift doesn’t make sense.
Last year, grinding at 6.5+ would have resulted in a super fast shot (~15s), but now it’s behaving as if that’s the correct setting for a balanced shot.

Could the pump actually be underperforming despite displaying 9 bar? Is there a way to independently verify pressure?

Could this be an alignment issue with the burrs, even though they were properly zeroed before?

Anything else I should check before assuming something is wrong with the grinder or machine?

Would love to hear if anyone has had a similar experience or ideas on how to troubleshoot!

Regular coffee does not do this.

I made the switch on  the thought that less caffeine would be good for me, but since drinking decaf it’s made my heart rate increase every time! On the days where I do have regular coffee (approx 3 days a week) I do not get these issues. This has been going on for upwards of 3 months, since I first made the switch.

So is this a common thing? Is it some kind of withdrawal from caffeine? I’ve researched it but I can only seem to find the explanation that decaf can still contain caffeine so it must be a caffeine sensitivity- but when I have caffeine I don’t have the problem! 

If anyone can advise or guide I’d really appreciate it!

Long post, tried to get all the cliff notes.","My wife and I have been married for almost 9 years, together for 11 and 1/2. She truly is my best friend. I am absolutely infatuated by her. We have 2 kids. 1 daughter from a previous relationship of mine (14y). She did a step parent adoption for her, and 1 daughter together (17months). Our whole marriage and relationship there have little things here and there that she’s lied about. It seems like every time I start trusting her she lies again. I know it takes 2 to tango. I lost my mom last year and I’m still processing through that. About 3 months ago we were arguing about her single male friend at school. I said it’s fine if she has that friend I just don’t want her spending one on one time with him. A few days later there was a small graduation celebration at a restaurant for a mutual friend of theirs and my wife asked to pick him up and another girl. I said sure that’s fine just pick up the female first. She flipped out saying it’s way out of her way. Come to find out she texted this guy saying “I don’t give a shit what my husband says, I’m picking you up” and deleted that message along with 39 other texts. I continued to better myself though, seeking therapy, being a better husband, doing anything I could. I literally wake up at 5 make her coffee, make her lunch (I usually put a note in her lunch everyday with a piece of romance poetry I read recently), make the baby milk bottles, take my oldest to school, go to the gym for an hour, come home, shower/change, go to work (9-5), come home, cook dinner, serve plates, eat when she gets home, and put the baby to bed. Not to mention I vacuum, mop, wash and fold laundry, and whatever else she asks me to do. I keep trying to make this work but I feel like I’m giving so much. I don’t want to miss watching that little girl grow up. I’m in the Army so it’s not like I’ll be local. I’m trying to trust blindly but she keeps breaking my trust. The other day she went to get a margarita after a long day of school. I thought it was weird she was getting one alone so I asked “are you getting a margarita alone” she sent a pic of the table said yeah but her laptop was open (she was studying) and the text at the bottom of the screen was from this guy saying “coming” then she acted like she was going to tell me but she was texting me the whole time. That text was sent like 5 minutes prior to me seeing it. I asked her last night “can we just get past this? I’m sick of fighting all the time” she said she didn’t know if she could get past the emotional trauma. I asked if she’s willing to try and she said she doesn’t know. She says she used to picture us retired and old in our forever home, but now she can’t picture that. When she thinks of her future now it’s of her and Maggie (our youngest) This is the first time either one of us has ever considered divorce. Like I said I love her with everything I have. Her and the kids are the reason I do anything. I’m so scared to lose her but I can’t keep having shit day after shit day and come home to hug an empty shell of a person.

On my team, there  is only one male coworker. We work on the same team but have different jobs. All the other male coworkers I genuinely have no interest in. Btw, I strongly assume he’s very careful as the only male coworker. 
 
A job opening for a different company that I’m interested in opened up, and because Korean is my second language, I thought it’d be best if he could help and look it over, because I trust him enough and he knows Korean and English. To create an opportunity to talk to him one on one, I asked him out to lunch as an “I owe you for helping me” excuse. That lunch was okay, and we mostly talked about work related stuff. I was able to make it to the first round of interviews and after that interview I asked him out to lunch again, as I genuinely wanted to talk about how it went. But at that lunch, we talked a bit more about our personal life. In June or July of last year, we were in his car with a new female coworker as he drove us back to the office after being out on business. To create conversation with her (because us 2 were too busy taking) he asked her if she has a boyfriend, and the last time she’s been in a relationship. She replied saying she’s never been in a relationship, and he asked that question to me right after. I also said the same, and he was shocked and asked about my ideal type. 

We got this second lunch around January of this year, and he brought up that discussion, acting as if he didn’t remember. He only brought what she mentioned up, then he asked me that same question. I gave the same response and he almost acted like he was hearing it for the first time. He was saying that me and that coworker dress well, have good personalities, and doesn’t understand how we’ve never been with anyone. To my standards, I was somewhat vulnerable with him about my reasons. He paid for that lunch and said “Next time we need to eat something even more yummy.” Also at this lunch, I found out that he is against dating coworkers. 

Out of the female coworkers on our team, I banter and teaser him the most (to the extent that I’m the only one that does so, as I work in a Korean workplace that is quite reserved). He seemed to care about me when he helped me with the job application and a few days ago I found out I got rejected. I made it to the final round of interviews, but I had a strong feeling that was gonna happen, so I wasn’t extremely upset by it (in others at work, I looked fine). I told him over coffee before about how the final interview went, and when I showed him the results he was like “You made it to the final interview?!” I was sooo frustrated to hear that, as if he has selective hearing or something. 

I will admit he rarely takes the initiative with me unless it’s work related. The only time he has recently was that he’d message me and ask about the job result. Also at one of the lunches, he asked if I would take the job if I get accepted, which feels like an extremely obvious answer to me. Last week I asked him what he’s having for lunch, and he told me he already ordered food. While I was asking purely out of curiosity and I followed up the conversation by saying that I still haven’t heard back yet about the job, he said “Let’s get lunch next week.” And of course, he never followed through. When I found out I got rejected, I messaged him directly saying “Have lunch with me today.” It was a Friday and he said he already got food, then followed up saying let’s get it next week. 

He’s really gentle and soft spoken which is why I like him. We have things in common and we do work well together in the workplace. I feel like our energy’s align decently and that we both are trying to be professional (at least from my pov), but I don’t understand why he acts the way he does.

I’m a 29-year-old guy trying to make sense of life, one existential dread at a time. I’m an introvert with a resting “why so serious?” face, but around the right people, I can be the loudest one in the room (or at least the one with the most awkward jokes).  

Here’s the deal: I’m not entirely sure what I’m looking for, but I know I could use a friend right now. Someone to talk to about the big things (life, art, mental health, why Arsenal refuses to win the EPL) and the little things (what you cooked today, that song you can’t stop looping, or how you survived Monday without caffeine). If we vibe, I’m open to seeing where it goes—whether that’s a deeper connection, a relationship, or just someone to share memes and comfortable silences with.  

A bit about me:  

- Music: Kendrick, JID, and SZA are on repeat. If you’re into music that hits the soul, we’ll get along.  
- Health: 2023 taught me that health is everything. I’m into gymming, eating clean, and sleeping like it’s my job. But I also enjoy getting high occasionally (once or twice a month) to just *exist* without overthinking.  
- Hobbies: Cooking is my therapy, coffee is my fuel (the darker, the better), and I have a soft spot for psychedelic art and deep conversations.  
- Humor: Dark, witty, and sarcastic. If you can handle awkward jokes and existential rants, we’re golden.  
- Travel: Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my mood boosters. Bonus points if you’re into deep, emotional, or spiritual conversations during sunsets.  

### What I’m looking for:  
- A nurturing, affectionate, and witty person who’s okay with my occasional shutdowns (I’m working on it, I promise).  
- Someone who’s passionate about *something*—art, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.  
- A two-way connection where we can talk about our days, dreams, and everything in between.  
- Bonus if you’re into Arsenal (I need emotional support) or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.  

I’m not here to rush into anything. Let’s start with a conversation and see where it goes. If you’re someone who’s kind, patient, and maybe a little lost too, hit me up. Let’s figure this life thing out together.  

P.S. If you’ve read this far, you’re already cooler than 90% of people I know. Slide into my DMs with your favorite song, a random fact, or just a “hi” if you’re feeling brave. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something real. Your move. 😊

1j0xgwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1j0xgwx/will_i_ever_get_to_the_point_where_my_trauma_is/,Will I ever get to the point where my trauma is less visible?,"It's been 1.5 years of work now. I can really feel the progress and I admire it because things are getting better and I'm doing it all by myself (can't afford therapy). I know it's not even that long so there's more to come and maybe I'm yet to achieve everything I want to achieve, but it still kind of sucks that my trauma is so visible. Many people are able to tell that I've been hurt and I don't really want it to be so noticeable because it often affects the way people perceive me. And the way I feel about myself when they're around – it's harder for me to be more confident, even if I know I can totally achieve this level of confidence with the people who know me less or just aren't perceptive enough. I'm not enjoying the fact that someone is able to tell such things about me. Not to mention that some people get a wrong ""message"" looking at me and think I'm an easy target or (at best) too sensitive.

And I don't know what else to do to get rid of that broken-on-the-inside, abuse survivor look. I actually love to laugh and I'm a mix of sanguine and choleric but people keep saying that I look tired and sad, and that my eyes are sad, especially in photos. Even if I'm smiling and thinking that I'm actually having fun. I'm doing my best to learn to smile more though because I look better smiling, just not really used to it. I laugh a lot but don't smile much. But I'm not in a bad mood or anything and I've never been depressed in my life.

I attend classes for my hobby and they involve some psychology. There are people there who've already studied this same thing last year. I once wrote in our chat that I know that my trauma shows up constantly and one of them responded, ""Excuse me, but it doesn't just show up – it SCREAMS"". It was very upsetting for me to hear because I thought I had such good progress, but then I kind of reminded myself that I can't remember when she saw me last time.

A big part of my problem is that one of the fundamental psychological needs – the right to exist – used to be constantly violated so I'm teaching myself that it's normal when people see me, hear me, know that I'm doing something, know what I love etc because I'm alive and I exist and I shouldn't be constantly hiding, not making any noises, not smelling anything, not leaving any traces etc.

I invent lots of tricks and lifehacks for making myself better and allowing myself just be. I've learned to not apologise all the time when I did nothing wrong. I'm learning to say no. I'm learning to say yes, I do want a cup of coffee, thank you. When someone allows me to do something that normally requires a permission, like when my flatmate says I can eat whatever I want in the fridge because she buys a ton of food impulsively and can't eat all of it, I no longer ask multiple times learning to trust people with what they previously said. I don't keep every single fucking item that belongs to me in my room – if something belongs in the kitchen or bathroom, then I keep it there. I don't always put my headphones on when I'm listening to something because I know it's not loud and me and my flatmate are both ok with this amount of sound and I don't even hear her when she's watching TV in her room, so how am I supposed to bother her? I talk to the people I'm uncomfortable with/afraid of just to stop being afraid and normalize the fact that I too can say something and be heard. I put myself through the situations I'm scared of, especially when It's something I actually want but don't allow myself to do. All of this and many more.

But no matter what I do, I always look so fucking sad and helpless and many people can sense that. I know I'm going to keep progressing and I'm not planning to ever stop learning new things so it's fine if it takes a few more years. I just wonder if it's possible to become indistinguishable from a ""normal"" person. I know you can't fully get rid of your trauma. But can it be completely covered under soft skills and charisma?

Uunahan ko na kayo, this is not some gawa-gawang kwento— totoo talaga kahit ako d mapaniwala na nangyari sakin to huhu. Always ako napapatulala pag kagising ko tuwing nagaappear siya sa panaginip ko parang recall ba haha.

So, l've been dreaming about this guy since I was around 15 or 16? I'm turning 18 now, and hindi naman super frequent/madalas (like once or twice a year lang), sobrang vivid ng dreams ko about him. Naalala ko pa mukha niya, bes girl, ang pogi niyaaaa, kung pede magdala ng real phone sa panaginip at makuha yung picture niya, ginawa ko na.

Iniisip ko nalang na ""what if siya talaga yung para sakin kaya hindi ako nag kakaboyfriend!"" Yung first dream ko about him, nasa Pasig kami. I know the place kasi nakita ko yung gas station na lagi kong napupuntahan nung bata ako-nadadaanan ko yun papunta sa school ko. Tapos nakita ko rin ‘yung blue building sa tapat, kasi dun mismo yung school ko sa loob.

Ang naalala ko lang here is pumunta kami sa condo or apartment niya, and alam ko may kasama siyang friend. Iniwan niya 'yung friend niya sa room nito, tapos dinala niya ako sa room condo niya. Pagpasok namin, he hugged me, then he kissed me sa forehead. Bigla akong nagising!!!!

Second dream, medyo may pagkahorror vibes. I know there's a movie about this-yung may giant flying monster na kumakain ng tao. And guess what? Andun ulit siya. Boyfriend ko raw siya dun, tapos he kissed me again before we went out of the house kasi lalaban kami sa mga monster. Pero ang sad kasi nakain siya habang nililigtas ako.
Nagising ulit ako.

Tapos kahapon lang, napanaginipan ko siya ulit. Girl, super pumogi! ang ganda ng outfit niya dun sa dream ko. Ang tangkad din. Pero this time, hindi siya boyfriend ko. Parang nasa coffee shop or mall kami, tapos lagi kaming nagkakatinginan-yung eye to eye ba. Then may ibang dimension ulit, nasa street kami, nakita ko siya hindi ko na maalala exactly what happened. I know naglalakas lang ako dun ik siya rin and nag-pass by lang ata kami eye to eye ulit, pero I swear, outfit and mukha niya talaga 'yung tumatak sa utak ko.

I know for sure na may iba pa akong dreams about him, pero baka hindi ko na maalala kasi ang dami kong napanaginipan in general. Pero grabe, ang weird at the same time, ang intriguing. Who is he?! nakakainissss ano kaya meaning neto huhu",1,1740828027.0,CasualPH,1,1.0,False

The Science Behind Banana Peel Teeth Whitening

Mineral-Rich Natural Whitening

Banana peels contain an impressive array of minerals and nutrients that contribute to teeth whitening. **Potassium, magnesium, and manganese** are the key players in this natural whitening process. These minerals work together to:

- Remove surface stains
- Restore tooth enamel
- Provide essential nutrients to your teeth
- Combat discoloration caused by coffee, tea, and smoking

How Banana Peels Work on Tooth Discoloration

The mechanism behind banana peel teeth whitening is fascinating. The inner part of the banana peel contains compounds that:

1. Gently scrub away surface stains
2. Provide minerals that help remineralize tooth enamel
3. Create a protective barrier against future staining

THINGS I LIKE:
- Minimalist look
- Wood / oak (planning to get the worktops wrapped in an oak colour. I love rustic wood too but think it may be too dark for my kitchen)
- coffee station

THINGS I DON’T LIKE:
- Gallery walls (I’m up for wall art but maybe like 2 pieces on the right and 1-2 shelves on the left above the Sage Barista Express coffee machine?)
- Dishes exposed because dust. So I don’t want any coffee mugs or spoons out. 
- Too much shelves on the wall, 

THINGS TO CONSIDER:
- Kettle/toaster are on the left hand side and dishes being dried sit below the cupboard on the right hand side (left of sink). 
- I will be keeping the yellow/mustard theme for the forseeable future so woody / oak tones would be perfect
- I don’t want the worktop covered. I still need space for a chopping board and for when unpacking after a food shop. 

I’ve also attached a few photos of things I like but I’m just not sure about the whole picture for my worktop and wall. Please help. I’ve been contemplating for years and it’s still empty 😅😩

1j0x1ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1j0x1ss/so_so_frustrated/,So so Frustrated!,"2nd time mom, first was tonguetied so pumped and formula, now a happy toddler. Trying breastfeeding for this one and it’s been so incredibly frustrating, hence the rage typing when I should be getting that precious sleep. 

1. The pain. This one was assessed by multiple nurses and LCs, not tied, good latch (pinky test). The initial latch pain is still toe-curing after 2 weeks. It does mellow out during feed once baby is more rhythmic. 

2. The latch and relatch. Anyone else’s baby loves to let go and re-latch?! Super frustrating considering each initial latch is so painful. Why don’t they stay latched?! 

3. The falling asleep. Many times baby would just drink for <5 minutes and fall asleep on the nursing pillow. After multiple attempts to wake her, even change her diaper and come back and retry, baby will just snack a bit and let go of latch. I swear the nursing pillow is where baby gets the highest quality sleep. But when I tried to put baby down, baby would immediately wake up and will take a bottle (BM or Formula) - clearly baby didn’t get enough from that 5 minutes. Oh and the “choking” when baby falls asleep too. Terrified me the first few times. 
3.1, sometimes baby let go after a painful let down, which is even more frustrating!! Why?! Here is all the milk, take it! 
No supply issue, can pump 2-4oz per breast via pump, potentially oversupply? 

4. The right vs left. I’m right handed. Somehow we will just get a better latch on the right. Those 5 minute latches usually happen on the left. It’s also more painful on the left. I have watched so many videos and tips on latching and positioning at this point. There are still clicking sounds from time to time, which I know indicates a shallow latch. But somehow neither of us (baby and I) cant figure out how to latch like the right. 

5. The engorgement. Just when I thought we’ve regulated ish, my breast gets full and hard and uncomfortable again!! 
5.1 oh and timing, What usually happens is the minute I can’t wait any longer and get hooked onto a pump for relief, the baby starts fussing for food, just “perfect” timing every time!! 

6. The frustration. I get so upset (tears) when baby only latches for a few minutes or latches and relatches, or chokes on let downs, and Engorgements and sensitive nipples (silverretts and shells do help here however). Normal? Or border-lining PPD?! 

My husband is ready to throw in the towel and go for full bottle feed (pump at my pace +formula) like we did for our first. His reasoning: so much physical and mental toll on both (I get so frustrated and sometimes take it out on him), why not go with something we know that worked and well. Formula is so easy with our formula machine set up, it’s like a baby coffee maker. 

He does have a point but somehow his reasoning adds to the frustration. I can’t get over the frustration of both bf and the fact that I yet again can’t make it work. 

Should I keep going?!

1j0wzd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1j0wzd5/my_trip_to_australia/,My trip to Australia,"I’m a backpacker. I've been, pretty much all over the world. From the bright lights of south east Asia to the rolling meadows of western Europe. But there was one spot that had up until recently, eluded me. Australia. Well, I finally bit the bullet and booked my dream trip down under. I'd love to sit here and tell you all about how incredible it was. How I saw some of the most unique sights I had ever seen in my life. To a point I suppose that's true. But I won't be going back there…

You see, I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of the Australian Outback, with its vast empty nothingness stretching as far as the eye can see. Something about getting yourself lost in its beauty, it's equal parts terrifying and exciting. So that’s exactly what I planned to do. It's also why Australia had remained unattainable to me up until quite recently. I was set on doing things... differently. I didn't want to do what every dime a dozen tourist did. I had no interest in seeing the sights of the cities, I mean I’m sure they’re beautiful in their own right, but for me, I wanted to get out into the wilds as quickly as possible.

I did some research beforehand, jumped onto some local Aussie backpacking travel groups on Facebook and I ended up getting quite friendly with a local. His name was Chris and he was part Indigenous Australian. Aboriginal Dad, and his Mother of Irish heritage. We got to talking and upon hearing all about my wishes to see the more secluded sights of Australia, he agreed to be my tour guide for the trip.

Alright! All was set. I flew into Sydney on a cold July morning. Yeah that’s their winter months down there. I was so excited as the Sydney Harbour bridge and the Opera House slowly came into view upon our descent beneath the clouds. I was right, the cities were beautiful in their own regard but still, that’s not what I was here to see.

I met my tour guide Chris at the airport and we hastily made our way to his vehicle, a stereotypical rusty Holden ute, and began the trek out west. The drive was bloody beautiful and I highly recommend you try it at least once in your lifetime. We eventually cleared the western suburbs of Sydney passing through Parramatta, Blacktown and Penrith before the urban scenery slowly began to give way to beautiful wide open spaces. Yeah, this is what I’ve been waiting for.

The drive continued on for hours as we passed through quaint little outback communities, some of which genuinely looked like ghost towns. It was awe inspiring to see the colours of this barren landscape change as we drove deeper toward the centre. Brown, dry bushland interspersed with pockets of green slowly transitioning into hot red earth. I was mesmerised. It was a long drive out there but I was so captivated by the sights I was seeing I honestly didn't notice. Eventually, just as night began to fall, we reached Broken Hill. This sprawling inland mining city deep in the heart of outback New South Wales was to be our base for exploring the remote wilderness of Mutawintji National Park.

We would stay the night here in Broken Hill. It was too late to start the hike into the park, Chris explained to me. It was already creeping into the afternoon hours, and if we got caught in the dark too far from a good spot to make camp, that could spell real danger out there. I wasn't going to argue. He knew this place better than I did. I was excited to get out there and really start exploring, but I'd also had little sleep on the long haul down here, and I wasn't going to say no to a good night's rest.

We checked into a quaint little hotel. Now, when I say hotel, I mean the Australian depiction of that term. If you're picturing the Hilton, think again. When Aussies say ""hotel"", they mean the bare necessities you need in a room, situated on the second floor on top of a pub (a bar). Falling asleep to the sounds of drunken Australian men shouting at eachother about two different types of football, neither of which I understand, was certainly something. But I was so tired at this point it didn't pose much of a barrier in my journey to slumber. A few pages into a good book and I was out like a light.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I awoke the next morning to the smells of breakfast and the sounds of my fellow guests shuffling their way down the stairs to dig into it. I was close behind them, ravenous after not eating very well at all the past couple of days. Aussies sure know how to start the day with a good breakfast. Well, a big one anyway, I don't imagine it would score too high a health rating. Mountains of bacon, sausage and eggs were loaded up onto a plate and I was given a huge mug of coffee to wash it down with. I'm... not really too big a fan of starting the day off with a heavy meal, but I got the feeling I wasn't in the best company to raise any complaints.

After breakfast, I met up with Chris and we loaded our gear into his ute. Before long, we were out on the open road again, surrounded by the endless red horizon. He wasn’t wrong. This place was remote. It was a few hours drive to the nearest entry point and from there we were on foot. We had everything we needed in our packs but still, there was something quite unnerving about trekking into such a vast open wasteland with not even a vehicle to retreat into should things go sideways. But, this is what I came for. And I was going to see it through.

That first step was something truly magical. The barely audible crunch of the soft top layer of dirt before my boot sunk into the red earth, it was surreal. I had waited so long to see this land, I couldn't quite believe I was actually here. Finally. The first day was full of little moments like that. The first time seeing a mob of kangaroos hop by in the distance. The first time smelling eucalyptus. The first time fearing for my life, as Chris threw an abrupt hand signal up in front of my face just in time to stop me traipsing ignorantly into a large eastern brown snake’s path. That sure got the blood up. And the first time seeing a billabong cresting the horizon after a full day of hiking, that was a sight to behold. 

It was around 4 or 5 in the afternoon by that point, so we decided to make camp for the night. It had been a long day, and I was starving. Thankfully Chris had picked up a few recipes from his old man during his childhood years growing up in a remote outback settlement. “Bush tucker” they call it down there. Chris cooked up a hot stew, and we had that with what they call damper, the “bread of the bush”. It’s actually really cool to see someone make bread using nothing but ingredients pulled straight from the land. It’s made using wattleseed and saltbush. It’s not much for the taste buds, but let me tell you, when you’re out there with nothing but the clothes on your back and whatever the land grants you, being able to fill your belly with bread is a beautiful thing. 

It was a great way to end what had been an amazing start to my first venture into the Australian outback. We set up our camp beneath some gum trees, nearby that beautiful billabong. It was of course far too cold for any swimming but the ambiance was nice. There was a trickle in a nearby stream and the crackle of the campfire had me off to sleep very quickly.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It must have been close to, or maybe just past midnight, when I awoke from a sound sleep, to a hand pressing against my mouth. This is obviously not a great way to wake up deep in the Aussie wilderness and believe me in that moment there were many thoughts of Australia’s outback serial killers racing through my mind. But as it would happen, it was Chris. His eyes were wide and he had a finger pressed against his lips, telling me in no uncertain terms to keep my mouth shut.

I began to glance around trying to find the source of Chris’s sudden panicked state. Looking around, at first I didn’t notice anything, just the vast expanse of the open outback in every direction. Nothing but darkness, and the infinite void of this ancient land. What made this experience even more terrifying is that we didn’t even have the cover of a tent, we were just camping out rough in our swags. I had no idea what to expect, I had visions of dangerous wild animals hunting us, circling in around us. That’s when Chris lifted a single hand and pointed down toward the water hole and whispered one word… “Nadubi”.

It took me a while in my sleepy state to process what I was looking at. In a flash I was reminded of every sleep deprived night spent as a kid after staying up late and watching my Dad’s scary werewolf films, for that is almost exactly what I was looking at here. It looked in every possible way, bar some subtle differences, like a werewolf. It stood bolt upright on two jagged hind legs, its arms slumped down by its sides and its head hung downward, its scrunched up face moulding into a slender snout which looked more beak-like than that of a dog.

It began to slowly creep around the waterhole, my eyes remaining fixed on it the whole time. With each step the dry earth crunched beneath it, and each one of those sounds will forever remain burned into my memory as with every one of them I thought for sure this thing was making its slow approach towards us. As it came closer to our side of the small pond I began to notice more alarming features about this thing. It may have resembled a werewolf in form and posture but that is where the similarities ended. Its entire body, was covered in what looked to be sharp tendrils, like a porcupine.

I watched as it sniffed at the still night air, I suppose searching for something it could call a meal. I don’t know. I’m unsure what its purpose was, what its motives were. But by the look of it neither could have been good. Chris, ever so slowly and carefully, pulled the small swag blanket over the both of us, and we huddled there in place, hoping and praying that we would go unnoticed.

For a series of very, very long hours, we lay there in the silence of the desolate Australian outback, as we listened to this thing take measured paces around our camp. It just, walked around, occasionally sniffing at our packs and some of the food we had left around camp. Intermittently, we would hear the unmistakable sounds of slurping. I guessed at that point it must have found itself some leftovers. Every so often it would retreat back over to the other side of the waterhole, from what we could hear anyway, but would then return. It seemed like it was waiting for something. Perhaps it thought somebody might be coming back, for whatever reason unaware that we were right there beneath the thin swag blanket.

It was, undoubtedly, the single most horrifying night of my life. The thoughts that were running through my mind after seeing this thing. Thinking about what it could do to us with that nightmarish form it carried with it. It was beyond terrifying.

We did not dare move that whole night. And it’s a good thing! As it would, in the end, be the light of day which would arrive as our saviours. I guess it didn’t much like the light, or perhaps the early morning heat it brought with it as it made its ascent, as we heard this thing very quickly run away as soon as the morning rays began making their way across our camp.

It still took us another good hour before we could summon the bravery to emerge from our makeshift hiding spot. I almost wish we had not. As we rose from our tiny sanctuary, and got a look at what had once been our tranquil little campsite, we were even more horrified than we had been the night before. We were greeted by the sight of many, many corpses. Lizards, possums, fish, snakes, even some kangaroos. Their bodies, lifeless. Seemingly, they were untouched. You wouldn’t even know they had been attacked in any way, were it not for the small holes in their bellies, and those disgusting slurping noises we had heard the night before.

We made haste getting out of there, needless to say. We stayed a night back in Broken Hill, and set off for the drive back east the next morning. The drive back to Sydney was a lot more solemn than the one we had taken on the way out there. Chris barely spoke. I almost didn’t want to break the silence but there were questions on my mind. That thing was obviously not of this world and yet he seemed to know exactly what it was at a glance. While not entirely certain of course, Chris shared with me that what we had seen, was most likely a Nadubi. It is an Indigenous tale of a grotesque, echidna like dog man which hunts by night. I didn’t get much more out of him, he looked as shaken as I was, understandably so. Despite growing up hearing many of these stories, I could tell by his demeanour this was the first time he had encountered one first hand.

I did end up staying a few more nights in Sydney. Honestly, I was still in a state of shock. I probably would have been on the next flight out had I been in any state of mind to book one. But I just, couldn’t. So I stuck around, until I could think straight. It wasn’t all bad I suppose, I ended up seeing a few sights around the city. I have a whole new appreciation for cities. Whilst I do still appreciate the blissful peace of the wilderness, I choose to admire it from afar. I have seen what lurks within the unexplored pockets of the Australian outback. I have seen why so many who venture too deep within fail to return.

For those of you wishing to experience it for yourself, I will not tell you what to do. I will leave you with only one piece of advice. That you educate yourself. Not only by the standards of modern humanity’s limited knowledge of this land, but listen to the stories of those who have lived here since ancient times. 

Do not underestimate their wisdom. It may very well save your life.",1,1740826512.0,CreepsMcPasta,0,1.0,False

I lay still, watching them, feeling the quiet hum of the world outside. The distant honks of cars, the occasional chirp of a bird, the muffled voices of neighbors drifting through thin apartment walls — it all blends into the familiar rhythm of another slow morning.

I stretch lazily, my fingers grazing the cool fabric of my blanket, and push myself up. My bare feet meet the wooden floor, sending a slight shiver up my spine. As I walk toward the bathroom, I step over scattered clothes. A reminder of my endless cycle of laundry. *This weekend.* I need to do it *this weekend.*

I reach for the bathroom sink, but my eyes land on an empty shelf. Shampoo and toothpaste. *Forgot them again.*

The sharp vibration of my phone cuts through the silence. I grab it off the nightstand.

*“It’s Josh.”* I whispered as a slow smile tugs at my lips.

*“Hey, cook me breakfast today!”* I say, balancing the phone between my shoulder and ear while gathering the mess of clothes from the bathroom floor.

*“Not today. I already bought breakfast,”* he replies. I hear rustling in the background.

I frown. *“Are you heading over here already?”*

*“Yeah. Open the door for me.”* Heart skipping a beat, I quickly toss the clothes into the laundry basket and jog to the door.

I pull it open just as Josh lifts his hand, revealing a steaming cup of dark coffee. The rich aroma curls into the air, mixing with the faint scent of his cologne.

*“I hope you didn’t forget. Black, no sugar.”* I take the cup from him, my fingers brushing against his for a split second, warmed by the heat of the cup. *“Careful, that’s hot,”* he warned.

He leans against the doorframe, his brown eyes flickering with amusement. *“I think you should really stop eating breakfast at four in the afternoon.”*

I roll my eyes, stepping back to let him in. “*You say that like I haven’t been doing this my entire life.”*

Josh has always been my *personal* chef, my unspoken routine. He brings me coffee — morning, noon, or afternoon, depending on when I drag myself out of bed. I can tell you I’m the friend he can take to parties under the guise of needing a wingman, but really, it’s to keep the girls away from him.

I settle onto the couch, sipping my coffee, the bitterness coating my tongue just right.

*“Then come here tomorrow at exactly 7 a.m. so I can have breakfast early,”* I challenge, lifting an eyebrow.

Josh smirks, his lips curling at the edges. He plants his hands on his waist, tilting his head slightly as if daring me to follow through.

I narrow my eyes. *“What? Are you challenging me? If you are, you should know I’m not lying.”*

He lets out a soft chuckle and hops onto the countertop. *“Fine. But if you’re not awake by 7 a.m. tomorrow, you have to do whatever I say for the next seven days.”*

I pause, tapping my fingers against my mug. *“Deal. But if you’re not here by 7, you pay my rent this month.”*

His expression falters for half a second before he sticks out his right hand. I grip it firmly and shake.

A slow grin spreads across his face. *“May your angels wake you up early,”* he teases.

I roll my eyes. *“You better be here first.”*

He laughs, leaning back against the counter, his usual teasing glint in his eyes.

It’s funny to think that I only met Josh five months ago. He slipped into my life so easily, as if he had always been there — bringing coffee, making bets, filling the quiet spaces with his easy presence.

I sip my warm drink, letting the warmth spread through me. *Tomorrow, 7 a.m. Let’s see who wins this time.*

I share a flat with a long-term flatmate, let's call her **Alice**, and a temporary subletter. Over time, I’ve realized that Alice has a really cynical, dismissive way of interacting—she constantly talks down to things I say, makes snarky comments, and always has a “told you so” attitude.

For example, if I bring up news, she’ll respond in an arrogant *“Well, obviously, that was expected”* tone. If I mention something I put effort into, like buying organic coffee, she’ll make a sarcastic joke like *“Yeah, probably just the packaging is organic, haha.”* It’s this constant, low-level undermining that makes me feel disrespected and uncomfortable in my own home.

I tried addressing this a while ago, letting her know that I wasn’t feeling great about the flat-share situation. Since then, **she has only gotten worse.** It feels like she took it personally, picked up on my discomfort and is now pushing even harder.

I also tried pulling back and limiting interaction, but when I do, she **notices immediately** and starts reacting. She’ll make comments about me being distant (too long to explain in detail) I feel **trapped**—if I interact, I get cynical, belittling responses. If I disengage, she also reacts.

At this point, I believe that she feels unwell with herself (she is a frustrated, overweight lesbian woman) and took it bad that I feel unwell living with her. It's like she wants to feel better by putting me down. I feel like she’s **playing a power game**, and I don’t know how to handle it. I’m trying to keep the peace, but honestly, I’m just pissed at this point. The temporary subletter is neutral in all of this, but it’s just making me feel even more like I’m unwell in my own home.

What’s the best way to deal with this kind of behavior? Should I completely ignore her and risk her escalating further, or is there a way to shut down her cynicism without creating an all-out confrontation?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s had to live with a **passive-aggressive, controlling, or undermining** flatmate before. How do I regain some sense of peace in my own home?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

In today's fast-paced world, many people are seeking effective ways to improve their health and shed excess weight. One popular approach is combining intermittent fasting with a smoothie diet. This unique pairing can maximize the benefits of both methods, creating a simple yet effective strategy to support your wellness goals.

### Understanding Intermittent Fasting

Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern that alternates between periods of eating and fasting. Unlike traditional diets that focus on what to eat, IF emphasizes when to eat. Typically, people choose a window, such as 16 hours of fasting followed by 8 hours of eating. This creates a natural rhythm that your body can adapt to, leading to various health benefits.

### Exploring the Smoothie Diet

A smoothie diet primarily involves replacing one or two meals a day with nutrient-dense smoothies. These blends often consist of fruits, vegetables, and protein-rich ingredients, making them a quick and easy option for busy individuals. Smoothies are not only tasty but also provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber that can support your overall health.

### Benefits of Combining Both Approaches

When you combine intermittent fasting with a smoothie diet, you can experience a range of benefits:

- **Enhanced Nutrient Absorption:** Smoothies packed with fruits and vegetables can boost nutrient intake during your eating window, ensuring that your body gets essential vitamins and minerals.
- **Weight Loss Support:** Intermittent fasting can help your body tap into fat stores for energy while the smoothie diet provides fewer calories, which can create a calorie deficit crucial for weight loss.
- **Sustained Energy Levels:** Smoothies made with protein and healthy fats help stabilize blood sugar levels, providing energy that can sustain you until your next eating window.
- **Improved Digestion:** The high fiber content in smoothies supports digestive health, while intermittent fasting can give your gut a break, enhancing overall gut health.
- **Convenience:** Both approaches are adaptable and easy to integrate into your busy lifestyle, allowing you more flexibility in meal planning.

### How to Implement This Combined Approach

Getting started with combining intermittent fasting and a smoothie diet is straightforward. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you begin:

#### Step 1: Choose Your Fasting Schedule

Select a fasting window that suits your lifestyle. Popular methods include the 16/8 method, where you fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window or the 5:2 method, which involves limiting calorie intake to about 500-600 calories for two days of the week.

#### Step 2: Plan Your Smoothies

During your eating window, plan nutrient-rich smoothies. Consider including:

- Leafy greens (spinach, kale)
- Fruits (berries, bananas, mangoes)
- Healthy fats (avocado, nuts, seeds)
- Protein sources (Greek yogurt, protein powder)

#### Step 3: Maintain Hydration

During fasting hours, drink plenty of water, herbal teas, or black coffee to stay hydrated. This practice can also help curb hunger pangs and keep your metabolism active.

#### Step 4: Monitor Your Progress

Keep a journal to track your meals, how you feel, and any changes you notice in your body. This reflection allows you to adjust your diet and fasting strategy as needed, ensuring optimal results.

1. I have not run into tooooo many issues with energy just yet, but that may be because I play a little before or after work, or just before I go to sleep, so this has been ok so far.

2. The ingredient upgrades did confuse me a bit. Like I bought vanilla, chocolate, slices, etc, just for them not to be used for a good amount of days, and even still some are not being used, but I had to get them to progress the story anyway?

3. I, perhaps controversially, like the more challenging/technical aspect. I love making the perfect coffee grind, and enjoy testing myself to see if I make new recipes correctly from memory alone. I did have the whole ‘making things well but customers wanting a full refund’ for a while, but I think I am over this hurdle (though I do wish they specified what was wrong, it was some trial and error and restarting days for me). 

4. Small thing, but the fact that ppl occasionally can sit in the shop? LOVEEEE. It adds such a little spark. 

There is defo more, like the wishing that upgrades were a bit more evident, but I have kind of made this a personal challenge, and so that I have to notice when smth is slow/keep track of how many days are passing to upgrade. Overall, I have been enjoying the game a lot, I am always excited to start a new day, and I love some of the new ‘challenging’ aspects :))

(Unless I’m misunderstanding?) 

I was speaking to some Aussies who said you need some kind of coffee course to work in cafes (completely new to me as someone from the UK!) 

So was wondering what other qualifications would help your chances of getting employed? Either from a red tape standpoint or just ‘stand out from the rest’ I know it depends per industry but we’re going to try anything we can so different avenues are good for atleast us to think about. 

Basically, if there are large hurdles that can be helped by taking some time and being proactive to do some extra training. 

We’ll be arriving in June so trying to make ourselves be better candidates for whatever opportunities arise. 

I know the answers will not be a guaranteed way perhaps the title should be ‘gives us a better chance’ rather than easier - but it’s about us doing anything we can do to atleast say we tried our hardest :) 

Edit: for some reason it says there are no comments when my notifications say otherwise so I’ll respond to the most common comment here…

I appreciate that it’s a very vague question, but as you have to change employers every 6 months and on average, i guess I’m more talking casual work - Whether that’s hospitality causal, retail, sports and leisure etc. I’m not asking about law qualifications or tech, I should have been clearer. Also being vague, means a variety of answers that might not necessarily help us but future readers of the post 😊


My partner has worked his way up in hospo to being a bar manager for 2 years, whilst having some office experience too. I’ve got 8 years in marketing whilst pretty much always having a 5-9 job of either restaurant or retail for extra cash but because of the changing employers rule, I know office work is near enough impossible. We have ‘decent’ skills, sure - it’s not our first job, but with the sheer number of people applying, it’s going to be a challenge. ",6,1740825734.0,AusVisa,8,1.0,False

I’m looking to upgrade my coffee machine and could use some advice. Right now, our setup consists of a DeLonghi Dedica 885 and a DF64 Gen II (previously used a 1Zpresso JX Pro for manual grinding) and we want to upgrade the machine. 

My girlfriend and I have a pretty consistent coffee routine:
- We make two cappuccinos back-to-back twice a day (morning & afternoon).
- I also drink one or two extra espressos throughout the day.
- We mostly stick to medium to dark roasts and haven’t really enjoyed light roasts so far.
- Guests aren’t a big factor, occasionally, parents or friends visit, but they’re happy with any decent coffee.

What we’re looking for in an upgrade:
- Better workflow (being able to steam while pulling the shot, so HX or dualboiler is probably gonna be the choice).
- Aesthetic appeal: we love the look of the Lelit MaraX in black. The small footprint is a big plus for our kitchen.
- Quality upgrade, but the coffee from the dedica already tastes quite decent to us and better than the coffee in most of the local coffees. So realistically we are not gonna be able to taste the difference between a shot from a 1000€ machine and a shot from a 5000€ machine. 
- Budget: anything around 1000 - 1500€ would be perfect, but if it needs to be more, it needs to be more

That said, I’m looking forward to have some advices or tips on what to keep an eye on. Would I regret buying a HX instead of a dual boiler? Which machines should I take a look at? What experiences did you make (maybe even with the MaraX)?

Thank you guys in advance!

I hope someone might be able to help me. I just purchased a used cabinet made out of pine wood for my kitchen. When I first got it, it smelled lovely, just like it should like pine wood. I cleaned it with warm water and sensitive soap (because the previous owner had a cat.)

I used a grinder for some spots and then some oil especially for wooden cabinets. Still the same smell I don’t mind at all.

But now that I put my bowls, cups and glasses in there, everything I pour into it like coffee, water, etc. smells/tastes like pine wood. I even got a sore throat now. That can’t be good right? Is it supposed to give off the smell to the dishes and cups?

Is there anything I can do so the smell and taste doesn’t rub off on my glassware, cups,etc?

I would appreciate any feedback. Thank you very much!

I have done GPU Passthrough without issue, it went buttery smooth but for some reason I cannot get audio. I tried Debian 12.9 as VM but then thought maybe I'll try Mint 21.3 and still have the same issue - no audio.

I am trying to make it work for a few days now so I become desperate to make it work, tried anything I could find on reddit and internet but still not even 1 sound can be heard from VM.  
To test if sound itself is playable I tried with success:

    1. Connecting USB headphones (audio with cracking)
    2. HDMI (when I passed HDMI audio via PCIE but now I don't) and it played
    3. Passthrough whole Intel HD Audio (Couldn't pass it as error appears)
    4. Pass whole USB via PCI (Intel...Chipset Family USB 3.0 xHCI Controller) with headphones connected (clean audio)

All played the sound but are just for testing as I need VM to play sound to my speakers.

No matter what I tried I always get this from both Debian and Mint log file /var/log/libvirt/qemu/Mint21.3-GPU-Pass\_Test.log:

    pulseaudio: pa_context_connect() failed
    pulseaudio: Reason: Connection refused
    pulseaudio: Failed to initialize PA contextaudio: Could not init `pa' audio driver
    audio: warning: Using timer based audio emulation

I thought this could be AppArmor but it doesn't seem to be as there is nothing in the `cat /var/log/syslog | grep DENIED`

I also thought that this could be issue with PipeWire as all distros are changing to it recently due to Wayland development but as soon as I try to change in XML `<audio id=""1"" type=""pulseaudio""` type to pipewire I get immediate error that it's not supported. This is also why I have chosen Mint 21.3 as it still runs PulseAudio (thought some PipeWire is also visible but not fully operational?)

I might have missed something so please help me find what is the cause or maybe a bug.

\- adding qemu code into XML again multiple versions  
\- changing PulseAudio settings, copy /etc/pulse/default.pa to \~/.config/pulse to add my user, even added group ""kvm"" as someone proposed

I thing it could be either something small trivial thing or maybe a bug or something I simply couldn't spot.

1j0wk0i,https://i.redd.it/4ibeooep12me1.jpeg,Book 4 of the Before The Coffee Gets Cold Series 💕,"Starting the month with this book! I loved the first two books, but by the third book, it started feeling like the series was stretching longer than it should. Some parts were still enjoyable, especially the moments with the café's family, but it's definitely getting a bit repetitive. Hoping this one brings back the charm! At least it's a light and easy read, perfect for getting out of a reading slump.

Need advice working through the hurt.","My boyfriend picked me up and broke up with me couple weeks ago. Acted normal the morning of, picked up coffee together. Acted like he was interested in the plans I was talking about for the day. And then said we needed to talk… He wasn’t happy with certain areas of my life. I wasn’t progressing in certain areas. He bottle these feelings. And things had been off with us for a month. No sex, no intimacy, he was colder towards me. I asked for a second chance. We talked after he told me and he agreed to work through things. We’ve been together almost 4 years. 
 I’ve worked on applying to job and figuring out some of the other things he’s wanted me to improve in. And I’m doing my part and working hard on it and he’s acknowledged that he’s seeing changes. And his moods better and intimacy is tiny bit better. We started couples therapy and have our second appointment coming up. But I’m really really hurting from the thought of that day he came and told me he wanted to break up. And I’m not sure how to work through the hurt. And need advice on how to work through it. Every-time he picks me up/drops me off I’m scared he’s gonna break up with me. Or if his tone is off or he says something certain say. That anxiety and my heart just drops and those same feelings come back about how I felt when he did what he did that day. And I absolutely love this man. And we are working through it. But I need help knowing how to get through this hurt :( It’s making it hard to trust him and feel secure in the relationship. ",1,1740824710.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False
1j0wh3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1j0wh3t/how_to_find_a_side_hustle_without_alerting/,How to find a side hustle WITHOUT alerting current job's boss,"As it mentions in the title, I do have a full time job, which is doing well! but unfortunately due to year over year economic strain (and a lack of specialty on my own part) basically my day job allows me to live month to month and nothing more :(  

I am looking for a side gig that it not mentally straining and could be done easily in my own time (as my current job sometimes requires me to work late or weekends). I am aware of the rarity of this but I have created a Fivver account (QA and data capture, but nothing has turned up there), I wanted to start a blog but hosting costs got me stuck, I feel morally challenged doing content farming on socials, and I have no ideas for YouTube (Also very saturated atm). 

A small side note is I want to try stay private to not attract too much attention from friends and family and my current work would not be very happy hearing I am looking for side gigs (fine if its a hobby) hence why my Linkedin is about as bare as a fresh college student's. I am looking for any ideas or something that is not a bot trying to phish me into a telegram scam (came across WAY too many of those) something I can control my time and that is not too mentally straining since my job does enough of that. 

Not to stretch this out too long but I often hear or read about people who find small side gigs, marking papers at a college, proof reading and such but I don't know how they do it :( I know networking on Linkedin is a great help but unfortunately A LOT of my colleagues regularly browse the platform.   
  
Last note on some things:  
\- Uber is out due to risk of where I live :(  
\- Minimum wage makes it hard for me to find any service type work like barista (I do like making coffee)   
\- I am a software developer BUT I do enough of that in my day job and cant even get into game dev due to the strain  
\- An online store is very off putting for me due to the current state of commerce also what would I even sell  
  
Any sort of advice or ideas are welcome :) since I am just plum out of any good ones :( ",1,1740824410.0,sidehustle,2,1.0,False
