1gvfgj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gvfgj5/why_cant_people_save_money/,Why can‚Äôt people save money?,"I‚Äôm purchasing a $325k house in south Florida at 25 years old. Me and my partner are both 25 and we have saved as much money as possible in order to be able to afford a house. 
Every time it‚Äôs mentioned, my colleagues and friends make it seem like I‚Äôm ‚Äúlucky‚Äù or ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù when in reality, I chose to sacrifice and hold on to as much money as possible. 
I had a conversation with my coworker the other day and I mentioned ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not saving a little bit of money every paycheck, what are you doing‚Äù and she responded ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so responsible‚Äù. I had another coworker who blatantly said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt decide what I want to spend my paycheck on this week‚Äù. 
Why are people so irresponsible with money? 
I am by no means lucky. My parents/family never helped me out. I‚Äôve had to struggle my whole life, couldn‚Äôt even go to college because I had to pay bills. Now I make good money and I choose not to get the coffee, skincare, new product, etc. I just work and save. Yet everyone says ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre so lucky to be buying a house so young‚Äù. Why is it that people just can‚Äôt save? Even in my lowest situations, jobless, homeless, I went on indeed and found something and worked hard at it. Now, I‚Äôm 25 and have saved 40k.

I almost feel jealous with the fact she's going out with him. To be fair, they're going out for coffee, but this guy, already I've not heard the best things about him. She likes him because apparently ""he's the male version of herself"". Her older sisters aren't too keen on the idea of her going out with this fully grown adult either, which helps me feel a bit better that I'm not on my own with this. She also told me that this fella was rather persistent on asking her out for coffee, asking her about three times on the same day she says. After she goes out for coffee with him, we've arranged to meet up, so that helps me feel the slightest bit better. I've known my bsf for a fair few years now, we are very close, our mums are close and my family are always asking about her, I care about her a significant amount. I definitely don't think she's interested in me, clearly if she's goin for another guy, but sometimes there's always these things that make me think.. ""Oh maybe she likes me back"" for example, we did a matching costume for Halloween, and I swear, the air was just so different. Some people at the party we went too genuinely thought we where dating. Now she loves fellas w mustaches, I'm a trans m, I've  got really dark hair, so I have that noticeable dark peach fuzz stash, I was talking to her and she fully tells me ""I wasn't listening to what you where saying, I was distracted by your mustache"" like???? What does that mean fellas. We where also very drunk, so idrk. But I feel like mainly since that night, I just can't stop thinking about her, I'd like to add too, recently she told me she'd date anyone, that being trans people, or women etc.. so It's not like I have no hope at all ig. I'm spiraling right now, but I just need a bit of advice, do I ask out my bsf, and do I tell her I don't agree with the fact she's going on a date with a grown man.

1gvf11k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gvf11k/still_heartbroken/,Still heartbroken ,"Just genuinely very down missing my ex boyfriend. We had none of the same hobbies. But I liked that he played games like valorant and had a favorite team. I liked that he enjoyed table tennis and playing basketball. He would often talk about how practice was going. He would tell me what he was eating for breakfast and we'd chat about the mundane things about our day. We'd go grocery shopping after class and went on special dates once a month. He'd send me coffee and a surprise treat every other day. And would often take me out for breakfast or lunch. Every time we passed by flowers he'd run to buy me a bouquet and surprise me. He had the most beautiful big yellow-hazel eyes. It genuinely looked like there was 24 karat gold swirling around in his eyes. Especially when the sun hit. I could genuinely stare at him for hours. I liked how deep and calm his voice was. And how he would just talk to me throughout the day. He was my best friend. 

It broke me when I found out he was cheating. I couldn't comprehend it. He cheated on me by messaging hundreds of women on dating apps and Instagram. He even met up with some a few times. I couldn't understand why he would do this to me. He said it was because he thought I was going to leave anyways. It made no sense to me. But he explained that he had been lying to me about doing well in uni - he was failing. I found out about the failing uni a few months prior to this. And we tried to resolve things. I reviewed the dates that he messaged all those girls and after the date he came clean about failing university he stopped cheating. But he never came clean that he *had been* cheating on me. I couldn't forgive it. I saw it as the ultimate betrayal. I drove to his house and told his parents what he did. I blasted him all over TikTok. And it went absolutely viral. He called the cops on me and the post was taken down. The only reason I had even found out that he was cheating on me is because a little kid saw him watching pornography on his phone and told me. That's when I went through his phone and discovered everything. 

I literally always had his phone in my hand because I would be searching for music. Never did I think he would be cheating on me. 

It ended so badly. Yet I still think about him everyday. A therapist specializing in addiction told me that it's best I left because guys like that don't change. And that to expect another person to give me as much attention as he did is absolutely unreasonable. Because he was unemployed and failing university so all he had was time. 

Now he's employed and has obviously graduated. He moved from Canada to the States. He seems to be doing so well. 

I can't seem to find anyone like him. And I ask myself if someone like the version he presented of himself even exists. I hate it here. I hate it sm. I feel like I'm trying to get over someone that was never real. 

I think I'm traumatized by how it ended. My own reaction. And how poorly I handled things. Idk if I miss him or just feel lonely. But I genuinely hate it here. ",1,1732069548.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Could it be something in my stack?","Not looking for medical advice, just advice on whether any supps I'm taking could cause issues like I'm experiencing.

I'm in my mid-30s. Eat a whole food diet (virtually no added sugars or processed foods). Used to be a weekend binge drinker through much of my 20s, but took a few years off booze altogether in my early 30s, and now it's the exception rather than the norm. I lift heavy 4-5x per week, and I'm in the best shape of my life. I carry a good deal of muscle mass and am relatively low body fat. I'm benching 325lb, overhead pressing 205, etc. I try to get in 10k steps as a minimum per day and often have 15k or higher. Mentioning all this not to brag but to point out that I'm a pretty fit and active individual. I also get annual bloodwork done and none of the core / basic panel has ever been off. I've recently had my vitamin D, cortisol, and testosterone checked and they were within normal ranges.

I take a number of ND/Thorne/NOW supplements (not all concurrently) including:

\* turmeric curcumin  
\* magnesium threonate  
\* black seed oil  
\* l theanine  
\* fish oil  
\* NAC  
\* Sulforaphane  
\* C3G (recent addition)

\* cistanche  
\* apigenin  
\* shilajit  
\* cbd oil  
\* medicinal mushrooms (lions mane, cordyceps, reishi - not currently on any of these)

With all this being said, I'll be honest: I'm anxious, and I would say even borderline depressed a lot of the time recently. It's been hitting me harder lately and I don't know why. My sleep is in check, I get 7-8 hours most nights, but I often find myself feeling rundown and tired as the day progresses, and I get stuck in worrying thought ruminations and just feel irritable and anxious quite often. But I also deal with a lot of brain fog and that's the part I don't understand given my diet and supplements. Sometimes I feel like I have trouble getting thoughts out verbally as I'm speaking, kinda like when you're dealing with brain fog from 3-4 hours of sleep, except I'm getting consistently good sleep! 

I'm wary of running to the doctor to be put on anxiety meds because I've always felt that is sort of putting a bandaid over the underlying root issue... but in my case I truly don't understand what the root issue is. I feel like I'm doing all the things I should be from a lifestyle standpoint, and the supplements I'm taking are well-supported for brain and mood boost. I even cut back my caffeine intake to just a single cup of coffee recently as I thought the anxiety could be from the caffeine.

I don't know where to start. I think, my infatuation towards you is getting out of hand. This started only with ""Happy Crush"" but now, I think about you all the time. Like, all the damn time. Right now, I'm trying to work but all I think about is you. I just need to let this out.

I think we have a lot of things in common. We have the same taste in music, love nature. Love poetry. Appreciate Daddy jokes. Kakampink. Loooovveee coffee. And we both love deeply.

Thank you for letting me follow you on IG. Thanks for the follow back, too. (I really wish I sent you this message the moment you followed me back.) Thank you for letting me view your stories and giving me a glimpse of your life. There were days when I feel so down and one post from you can blow all the dark clouds away.

I always wonder what it feels like to be yours. To freely touch that thin lips of yours. To be the last person who sees you before you sleep and to be the first person you'll wake up to. To listen to your songs (may it be in videoke or in the shower). I want to cook breakfast for you. To learn how you like your coffee and be the person to make it for you for the rest of our lives.

I know you are ready to find your way back into love and you are just waiting for the right person. I really hope to be the one that you'll see waiting for you at the end of the road but I guess this will remain as a dream of mine.

I really wish I can send you this. I am not afraid of rejection. I wish to pursue you. But right now, my life is a mess. I think, I am already at the age where I should have figured life out but I don't. I don't want you to drown with me.

Guess, this is all. Soar high! I'll continue to admire you from afar. If red strings are real, I wish you are holding the other end of mine. If not, I hope to meet you again on our next lifetime, when life is a little kinder and lighter.

Please just don't disappear. Thank you.

P.S. If you have time, please look for my message for you in sendthesong.xyz. It's with the song we both used on the same aquarium set up video in IG. Hehe.

Ergonomics is super important in the workplace. It‚Äôs all about designing your work environment so it fits our bodies and makes us work better and feel good. Think about it: you sit for hours hunched over your desk, your back hurting, and your eyes straining from a bright screen. Ouch! That‚Äôs where ergonomics comes to the rescue‚Äîhelping us prevent discomfort and injuries, while boosting efficiency and productivity. In this article, we'll dive into why proper ergonomic practices are essential, share some personal stories, and look at how a few simple changes can transform our work lives. Let‚Äôs get comfy!
  
  
## What is Ergonomics?

Ergonomics, at its core, is all about designing workplaces that _actually_ fit people, not the other way around. Imagine trying to squeeze into a one-size-fits-all chair that‚Äôs just a tad too small. Sounds uncomfortable, right? Well, that‚Äôs exactly what happens when workplaces don‚Äôt consider ergonomics. It‚Äôs not just about comfort‚Äîit‚Äôs about aligning our work environment with how our bodies and minds function best. 

To put it simply, ergonomics is like the Goldilocks of workplace design. Not too high, not too low, but _just right_. It focuses on things like chair height, desk position, and even the angle of your computer monitor. Why? Because when these elements are out of whack, you might end up hunched over like a shrimp or constantly twisting your neck. Over time, that‚Äôs a one-way ticket to aches, pains, and _a lot_ of grumpy mornings. 

Take an office chair, for example. A poorly designed one is like sitting on a brick‚Äîstiff, unforgiving, and downright miserable. But a good ergonomic chair? It supports your back, lets your feet rest flat on the ground, and even gives you the freedom to lean back occasionally without feeling like you‚Äôre about to topple over. 

It‚Äôs not just physical comfort, either. Ergonomics keeps your mind sharp, too. When you‚Äôre not distracted by a sore wrist from typing at an awkward angle, you can focus better, think clearer, and probably avoid typing something you‚Äôll regret.

## The Impact on Health

Let me tell you something that changed the way I look at work‚Äîand I mean, literally changed it. A few years back, I had this coworker, let‚Äôs call her Mia. She was always rubbing her wrist, fidgeting in her chair, or stretching her neck like she‚Äôd just wrestled a gorilla. Turns out, Mia wasn‚Äôt just being dramatic. She was battling _carpal tunnel syndrome_ and chronic back pain, all because her workstation looked like it belonged to someone who hated her. 

This isn‚Äôt just Mia‚Äôs story, though. Poor ergonomics is a silent troublemaker. Ever heard of ""tech neck""? That‚Äôs what happens when you crane your head down at a screen for hours. It‚Äôs like an invisible punch to your spine. Oh, and don‚Äôt even get me started on those chairs. If your chair doesn‚Äôt support your lower back, your spine starts complaining in a language called _pain_. And it doesn‚Äôt whisper‚Äîit yells.

According to OSHA, musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) like back pain and repetitive strain injuries are some of the most common workplace health problems. I mean, we‚Äôre talking about _33% of all worker injury cases_. Thirty-three percent! That‚Äôs a third of the office walking around in quiet agony.

And it‚Äôs not just physical pain. There‚Äôs the mental toll too‚Äîconstant discomfort can make you irritable and less focused. Trust me, I‚Äôve seen Mia at her worst. She‚Äôs lovely, but pain turned her into a grumpy cat in human form.

If you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù let me tell you: ergonomics is like sunscreen. You don‚Äôt realize you need it until it‚Äôs too late. So, save your neck, your wrists, and your mood before they start staging a rebellion.

## Boosting Productivity

Picture this: you‚Äôre slouched over your desk, twisting like a pretzel to see your monitor, while your chair squeaks under the strain of all that awkward positioning. Now, imagine the same you, seated in a chair that feels like it was tailored just for you, with your desk set at the perfect height and your monitor adjusted to eye level. Which version of you is typing away like a productivity powerhouse? Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs definitely not pretzel-you.

Ergonomic adjustments are like cheat codes for productivity. When your workspace fits your body, not the other way around, everything just flows. Take chairs, for example. A chair that supports your lower back and lets your feet rest flat on the floor can save you from those pesky ‚ÄúI‚Äôve-been-sitting-too-long‚Äù aches. And when your desk height is just right, your arms naturally rest at a 90-degree angle, letting you type away like a pro without feeling like you‚Äôre battling the keyboard.

Let‚Äôs not forget monitor placement‚Äîit‚Äôs a game changer. Position it at eye level, about an arm‚Äôs length away, and suddenly, you‚Äôre not craning your neck like a flamingo. Add in a footrest or an adjustable keyboard tray, and boom‚Äîyour comfort skyrockets, taking your focus and efficiency along for the ride.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: happier bodies make sharper minds. With fewer distractions from discomfort, your brain is free to dive into the task at hand. It‚Äôs like magic, but with science to back it up.

## Simple Ergonomic Fixes

Let‚Äôs face it‚Äîmost of us spend our workdays pretending our spines are question marks. But here‚Äôs the thing: a good ergonomic setup doesn‚Äôt require a trust fund or a degree in workplace engineering. Sometimes, it‚Äôs the small, practical tweaks that make the biggest difference. Ready to transform your desk dungeon into an ergonomic paradise? Let‚Äôs dive in.

* **Chair tweaks:** Your chair is like a best friend‚Äîit should have your back, literally. Look for one with adjustable lumbar support. If that‚Äôs too fancy, grab a small pillow or even a rolled-up towel and stuff it behind you. Instant spine hug.
* **Desk height drama:** Your desk should let your arms rest at a comfy 90-degree angle. Too low? Use sturdy books or risers. Too high? Lower your chair, but don‚Äôt let your feet dangle‚Äîuse a footrest or, if you‚Äôre me, a shoebox.
* **Screen placement magic:** Your monitor‚Äôs top edge should line up with your eye level. If you‚Äôve been craning your neck like a giraffe, stack some books under that screen. And for the love of all things ergonomic, stop looking down at your laptop all day‚Äîinvest in a stand.
* **Keyboard and mouse maneuvers:** Keep them at elbow height and close enough to avoid stretching. Bonus tip: a wrist rest can save you from carpal tunnel and keep your hands happy.
* **Lighting matters:** Squinting at a dim screen? Not only does it wreck your eyes, but it also gives you that perpetual ‚Äúthinking hard‚Äù frown. Get a good desk lamp and position it to avoid screen glare. Trust me, your eyeballs will thank you.

Remember, these changes don‚Äôt just boost comfort‚Äîthey prevent the dreaded ""desk job hunch"" and make you feel less like you‚Äôre battling your workstation. Plus, who doesn‚Äôt love the excuse to go shopping for a cute new lamp?

## Ergonomics at Home

When the pandemic shoved many of us into the brave new world of remote work, I thought, ‚ÄúHow hard could it be? Couch, laptop, coffee‚Äîdone.‚Äù Spoiler alert: it wasn‚Äôt done. Two weeks in, my back felt like I‚Äôd been carrying a baby elephant, and my neck developed this charming kink that made me look permanently skeptical. Turns out, balancing your laptop on a stack of old cookbooks isn‚Äôt ergonomics; it‚Äôs a chiropractic emergency waiting to happen. 

Here‚Äôs the thing: working from home comes with unique challenges. Unlike an office, where ergonomic chairs and adjustable desks are (mostly) standard, home setups tend to be, well, _creative._ You‚Äôve got kitchen chairs, coffee tables, and beds doubling as workspaces. Comfortable? Maybe for a Netflix binge. Productive? Not so much. 

The solution isn‚Äôt about blowing your savings on fancy equipment‚Äîit‚Äôs about small, smart changes. Invest in a chair that supports your lower back or grab a cushion if you're on a budget. Elevate your screen to eye level (shoe boxes work in a pinch) and keep your keyboard at elbow height. Got a standing desk? Great. Don‚Äôt? A sturdy ironing board works surprisingly well. 

Once, I set up my ‚Äúoffice‚Äù at the dining table, forgetting it was _the_ spot for family meals. My Zoom meeting turned into dinner theater when my kid decided to reenact her favorite movie scene‚Äîcomplete with spaghetti props. Now, I keep my workspace separate. Trust me, it‚Äôs worth the effort. Your body‚Äîand your coworkers‚Äîwill thank you.

## The Future of Work Ergonomics

Why is ergonomics such a big deal in the workplace? Well, let me tell you a story. A few years ago, I had this chair at my desk. It squeaked like an old screen door and leaned to the right, as though it had ambitions of becoming a recliner. I thought, ‚ÄúNo big deal.‚Äù But after a few weeks, I started getting this weird crick in my neck, and my back felt like I‚Äôd been wrestling an alligator. It wasn‚Äôt until I swapped that chair for an adjustable one‚Äîwith proper lumbar support, thank you very much‚Äîthat I realized how much that old seat had been sabotaging me. My energy came back. My productivity shot up. And, yes, the alligator finally left my spine alone.

The thing is, poor ergonomics isn‚Äôt just about discomfort; it‚Äôs a silent productivity thief. Imagine spending half your workday shifting, stretching, or fidgeting to find a position that doesn‚Äôt feel like torture. That‚Äôs time you‚Äôre not focusing on, well, actual work. Plus, bad setups can lead to long-term problems like carpal tunnel, back pain, or even stress injuries. 

Think of ergonomics like investing in yourself. A well-designed workspace doesn‚Äôt just prevent aches‚Äîit helps you work smarter, faster, and happier. And who doesn‚Äôt want that?

## Conclusions
  
  
In conclusion, embracing ergonomics in the workplace isn't just a nice idea; it's essential for our physical comfort and mental focus. When we invest time in creating an ergonomic workspace, we not only reduce the risk of nasty injuries but also enhance our overall productivity and well-being. Who knew adjusting your chair could lead to a more enjoyable workday? So, let‚Äôs champion those comfy chairs and adjustable desks. Spread the word! Whether you work from home or in an office, remember that a healthier, more comfortable work environment is just a few tweaks away.

This is a pretty explosive statement to make, but I have nowhere else to go.

There‚Äôs something seriously wrong with them. 

I‚Äôve lived with them for almost two years now. They were my saving grace in my sophomore year of college when I was at my worst mentally. 

I won‚Äôt spend a long time describing them or telling our backstory, but I want you to know these are not bad people. I‚Äôve known them and trusted them too long. In a way, they‚Äôre like my second family or even my first.

I‚Äôm writing this post because I‚Äôm getting increasingly worried about them and myself, and the state we have found ourselves in.

It began around a month ago. 

I started losing time. Long stretches of time, whether it was night or day. 

I‚Äôd go to class or to the library to study, and suddenly wake up at home. I didn‚Äôt remember walking back or what I‚Äôd been doing in that missing stretch of time.

I thought it was stress-related or maybe health-related, so I went to see the campus doctor. But he just prescribed me sleeping pills and asked me questions about my diet and lifestyle, as if that had anything to do with the fact that I was blacking out for hours at a time with no recollection of what I had been doing.

It was the same every time. 

I woke up in bed with a gnawing hunger in my gut, like I hadn‚Äôt eaten in weeks, and no memory of how I got there.

It was definitely a weird situation, and paired with the fact that my roommates  were acting increasingly weirder and less like themselves, I figured the two were linked. The thing with them wasn‚Äôt too crazy at first. I mean, it was just something I noticed. For reasons which baffled me, the three of them were suddenly sensitive to the moon.

And I don‚Äôt mean that it caused them headaches or nausea. I mean it affected them in ways which didn‚Äôt make sense.

Have you ever heard of the Transylvania Effect?

According to Discovery Magazine:

‚ÄúIn the dark sky, the clouds shift, revealing the full moon‚Äôs eerie silver gleam, and the people on Earth below go mad.‚Äù

I wouldn‚Äôt have called it going mad, but something was wrong with them.

Different.

And it‚Äôs always the full moon that triggers it. Which made me wonder if it was, in fact, the Transylvania Effect.

I first noticed it at Abigail Matheson‚Äôs house party. The party was nothing special, really. 

I didn‚Äôt drink that much that night. 

The point is, I can‚Äôt blame what I saw on being drunk.

I know perception can be misinterpreted and messed up when you‚Äôve had one too many canned Strawberry Daiquiris, but I was completely sober.

And I was planning on staying that way until we left.

I remember the night in clarity. I‚Äôm not a fan of crowds, so I lingered in Abigail‚Äôs kitchen playing around on my phone.

I only knew Abigail Matheson from Rowan and Immie. They were in the same classes.

I needed to find something to occupy my mind or I was going to die of boredom.

Most of the party was in the living room playing Mario Kart, and I was refilling my glass when I glimpsed Immie‚Äôs familiar blonde ponytail bouncing through straggling students grinding against each other.

The party wasn‚Äôt costume-themed, but Immie insisted on wearing a baby blue ribbon in her hair, which reminded me of a grown Disney character.

Imogen Prairie was the human embodiment of a golden retriever.

She is as adorable as she is na√Øve and is always smiling no matter the situation.

I lifted my drink in greeting, about to shout her name, but then I saw the expression on her face.

She looked‚Ä¶ wary.

No, that‚Äôs not the word. 

I can‚Äôt describe her expression because I couldn‚Äôt understand it myself. 

For once, Imogen wasn‚Äôt smiling. Her eyes were wide, lips twitching into a scowl.

Her movements were erratic as she headed into the kitchen, grabbing a glass of punch and downing it before striding towards the back window and pulling the blinds shut.

Rowan, roommate number two, was right behind her.

They were talking in hushed whispers, their heads pressed together before Rowan noticed me.

Rowan was what you would call pretentious cute.

Usually dressed in trench coats, his party outfit was oddly normal.

Shirt and jeans, a loose pair of glasses sitting on top of unruly brown curls.

Rowan Beck resembled what *he* called a ‚Äònormie‚Äô.

He fixed me with what I can only describe as a patient smile. ‚ÄúNin! Have you seen Kaz?‚Äù

The copious amounts of lemonade I‚Äôd been drinking all night started to crawl back up my throat.

His tone was different. Darker. Nothing like I knew.

That was the first night I noticed something was wrong with him.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù I said stupidly. ‚ÄúKaz?‚Äù

Rowan raised a brow. ‚ÄúYep. Kazzzz.‚Äù He dragged out the Z. ‚ÄúThe guy you *live* with. Have you seen him anywhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't think so.‚Äù I caught his sharp glance at the blinds. ‚ÄúRowan, are you‚Ä¶ okay?‚Äù

The man's gaze snapped to me. 

‚ÄúI'm peachy.‚Äù

Rowan leaned against the table, his expression darkening. I sensed the desperation emitting from him, but it didn‚Äôt make sense. Was Kaz in trouble? 

And why were they keeping it between them? What were we, little kids? 

His expression was sour, like he couldn't bear talking to me. ‚ÄúDid Kaz by any chance‚Ä¶ I don't know,‚Äù he tapped out a tune on the countertop. ‚ÄúMayyyybeee go outside?‚Äù

Our third roomie had been MIA since the four of us walked in earlier. 

He made a comment about going to talk to a guy he was crushing on before disappearing into the crowd. 

I hadn‚Äôt seen him since. Which was very unlike Kaz. 

When it comes to games, or anything playable, he‚Äôs a competitive bastard. 

I expected him to be in the living room with the others, slamming buttons like his life depended on it. Instead, he was nowhere to be seen. 

I opened my mouth to speak, when Immie stuck her head through the gap in the door. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fine!‚Äù Immie said, a streak of panic in her tone. She shooed me back when I started forwards. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got this. Kaz is just, uh, well, he's doing Kaz stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúKaz *stuff*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù Imogen‚Äôs smile was a little too big. ‚ÄúLike I said, we‚Äôve got this.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave we?‚Äù Rowan snapped. He raked his fingernails down his face. ‚ÄúHow do you lose a 23 year old guy?‚Äù

Immie scowled, throwing a cup in his face. 

‚ÄúHe told me he was going to the bathroom.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I could follow him.‚Äù

Rowan tossed a cup right back at her. ‚ÄúIn these circumstances, yes, you should have followed him!‚Äù Lowering his voice, Rowan pulled her closer. But I still heard him. ‚ÄúHe could *drown!* What did I tell you about keeping the idiot away from the pool?‚Äù 

Imogen scoffed. ‚ÄúI'm sorry, how is that fair? Why don't *you* babysit?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou offered.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, not for the whole night!‚Äù

Their argument was barely registering. 

*Drown?*

‚ÄúNin. You stay here.‚Äù Immie grabbed a reluctant Rowan‚Äôs arm.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go get him.‚Äù

I nodded with a smile, but that didn‚Äôt stop me following them. 

I made it to the front door, almost tripping over myself. 

The party continued behind me, laughter, and giddy screaming from the living room. 

In front of me, however, was something entirely different from the party. 

The front door was wide open, and the night sky bled inside the house. 

My three roommates  stood on the threshold, their heads tipped back, eyes on the night sky, and the full moon bathing the dark in unearthly light. 

I‚Äôve looked this phenomenon up, and it can be called ‚ÄúMoon drunk‚Äù but this had never happened before. I had lived with them for two years and this was the first time they were entranced by the fucking moon of all things. 

Kaz was in front of the others, and I glimpsed a can of beer at his feet spilling its contents onto rough concrete.

At first, I thought they were marvelling the sight. I mean, it was beautiful enough to stare at and smile, maybe comment on it or take a photo. 

""Hey."" I clapped my hands in Rowan's face. ""What's going on?"" 

He didn't even blink. 

Moving to Immie and Kaz, I shook them. 

Still nothing. 

They did move‚Ä¶ eventually. 

‚ÄúSee.‚Äù Rowan‚Äôs voice was almost a breath, his gaze still on the sky. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve found him.‚Äù

When the music stopped, they came back to life, ignoring me, and bound back into the party with no explanation to what the hell had just happened.

‚ÄúMoon drunk‚Äù was starting to make the most sense.  

I got my answer when I went back inside, and Kaz was raiding the refrigerator. 

I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I saw pieces of raw bacon squelching between his fingers and stringy white sticking from his mouth. 

Now, there‚Äôs getting the munchies, and there‚Äôs willingly stuffing yourself with raw bacon. 

‚ÄúKaz?‚Äù

The boy twisted around so fast, almost inhuman. 

Kaz slowly inclined his head, bacon fat caught between his teeth. 

There was a feral look in his eyes, which told me if I even attempted to stop him from feasting on raw pork, I‚Äôd lose a finger.  

His gaze tracked me like a predator, before turning back to his meal. 

I left him to whatever *that* was. 

Immie, who hadn‚Äôt paid attention to a guy since freshman year when she was assaulted at a party, was sitting in a random guy‚Äôs lap, her lips latched to his ear. 

It was Immie who looked to be the one in control, but even being moon drunk, I didn‚Äôt want her anywhere near a guy. 

Not when she was still in therapy. 

Before I could intervene, my housemate was yanking the guy to his feet in one pull and dragging him upstairs.

To my shock, though, it was the guy who pulled away from her. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù He hissed, ‚ÄúGet off me!‚Äù

Immie didn‚Äôt seem fazed. She just offered him a smile and walked away, this time plonking herself in a girls lap.

It was strange behavior, considering Kaz was a vegetarian, and Imogen was terrified of intimacy.

Rowan was acting, objectively, the least weird. I found him in the kitchen staring into his drink.

When I tried talking to him, he responded with one-word answers, his gaze glued to whatever was so fucking fascinating about his glass of diet coke. Was it a dead fly? 

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù

I followed him around, trying to snap him out of it. 

‚ÄúHm?‚Äù His voice was almost sing-song. 

‚ÄúRowan!‚Äù

He twisted around, doing a little dance, half lidded eyes struggling to take me in. 

‚ÄúWhaaaaaat?!‚Äù

I tried to keep my patience. ‚ÄúDid you know your best friend is currently gnawing on raw pig?‚Äù

I regretted my words ten seconds after saying them. 

This guy was going to be *zero* help. 

‚ÄúUhmmm, soooo?‚Äù Rowan settled me with a childish grin. ‚ÄúYou know what you are, Nin?‚Äù

I didn't answer, already expecting a stupid answer. 

Rowan threw a plastic cup at me. *‚ÄùCuphead.‚Äù*

Comedic genius. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is going on?‚Äù I hissed, only for him to lean forward, and blow in my face. 

‚ÄúDo you like chicken *tenders*?‚Äù He asked, before bursting into childlike giggles. 

Rowan spent the rest of the evening aimlessly walking around with a stupid smile on his face. 

He called me *Cuphead* for three hours straight. 

All three of them had that same mystified grin and I couldn't snap them out of it. 

After the party, I noticed the following full-moon they seemed to go 0-100 in terms of personality changes. 

Kaz would spontaneously decide to go visit his parents in another state for no reason. 

Rowan was obsessed with blocking every window to avoid moonlight spilling in, and insisted the whole house had to be protected with duct tape covering every window and reflective surface. 

As for me, I was locked inside my room with the curtains drawn‚Äîforced to wear headphones with music playing. 

There was only one rule I had to follow, and when I questioned it, I just got the same answer from all three. ‚ÄúTrust us.‚Äù 

They wanted me to trust them when Kaz was gnawing on raw meat like an animal during a full moon, Immie was throwing herself at random guys and girls, and Rowan went into a trance-like state when he caught sight of anything reflective.

I understood the moon was affecting them in ways I couldn‚Äôt understand. 

But locking me in my room until the morning was over-kill. 

I was the only one who wasn‚Äôt affected by the moon‚Äôs light, and yet they treated me like I was in trouble too.

Despite being overly reluctant, I agreed to their rules. I stayed in my room and listened to music as loud as it would go. 

According to them, I couldn‚Äôt at any point remove my headphones. 

After playing half of my Spotify playlist, I drifted off, and before I knew what was happening, I was waking up with sunlight poking through the blinds,  feeling like shit, a gnawing hunger in my gut which splintered into nausea. 

There were differences that jumped out at me when I pried my eyes open, blinking through intense sunlight.

I was wearing different clothes. 

I remembered I‚Äôd changed into a shirt and shorts for bed, but I was dressed for the day. I didn‚Äôt remember drinking anything before falling asleep, but an empty glass was on my bedside.

Except mouth was parched, my lips dry.

I didn‚Äôt question it. I wanted to, but anything was possible.

Maybe I was the delusional one. I was blacking out, so maybe I dressed myself without knowing, and then slipped downstairs and grabbed a drink of water in the early morning.

After that night, things seemed to go back to normal. 

I decided that it really was a case of being moon-drunk. 

The others didn‚Äôt talk about it again, and life went on, I guess.

I thought about talking about it with them, but when I tried, they would stiffen up or change the subject. 

Rowan would completely shut me down, and Kaz acted like I had a contagious disease. 

I asked Immie if anything happened, and she screwed up her face and jumped up with an excuse that she needed to go somewhere. 

Kaz dismissed everything I said and told me they were fine, and that the moon just ‚Äúgave them headache‚Äù.

I can be an idiot sometimes, but I was pretty sure eating raw bacon like an animal couldn‚Äôt be justified with that excuse. 

When I tried to argue, he grabbed the controller from a sleeping Rowan, and dared me to fuck up Immie‚Äôs island. 

I did, swiftly ending up covered in Rowan‚Äôs breakfast the next morning.

So, basically, my roommates  were hiding something big from me, and I wasn‚Äôt planning on telling them about the blackouts.

Because part of me wondered if they were involved. 

I was convinced the two phenomenons were linked.

So, yeah, a pretty toxic mindset to have on both sides.

Anyway, this leads me to what happened last night.

It was the usual‚Äì the usual I had gotten used to, anyway. 

After class, I hurried home to help with prepping the house for the full moon. 

Rowan was standing on a chair, taping up the windows, and Immie was closing all the curtains and blinds. 

He was being an asshole as usual, so I busied myself with hiding everything reflective I could find, before retiring to the living room and joining Kaz who was working on his laptop. 

Immie and Rowan were hard to talk to about what was going on, but with Kaz being the resident stoner, his walls came down a little. I slumped down on our Craigslist couch and grabbed a controller, resuming a game of COD from earlier. 

‚ÄúSo.‚Äù I focused on the game, navigating my first-person character through a pile of bodies.

Kaz offered me a smile over his laptop. He reeked of weed. 

‚ÄúSoo..?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you ever planning on telling me what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe moon.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs moon night, and as usual everyone‚Äôs freaking out.‚Äù

‚ÄúFreaking out?‚Äù Kaz‚Äôs gaze strayed on his laptop screen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the epitome of calm right now.‚Äù

I threw a cushion at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stoned. And I‚Äôm still waiting for you to explain your spontaneous Peppa Pig binge.‚Äù

He tossed me a sheepish smile. ‚ÄúI was hungry.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a vegetarian!‚Äù I said, immediately remembering Rowan‚Äôs moon-drunk state. 

‚ÄúRowan was‚Ä¶ *giggling*.‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúIt was‚Ä¶ oh god, I'm still having nightmares.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúOkay, he was definitely replaced.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr you *both* were.‚Äù 

Kaz shrugged. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already told you. It‚Äôs just sensitivity. The moon can do shit like that. Look it up.‚Äù

‚ÄúSensitivity.‚Äù I repeated in a scoff, glaring at war-torn Europe on the TV screen. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you‚Äôre calling it?‚Äù

Kaz lifted his head, his gaze snapping to me. ‚ÄúWhat else do you want to call it?‚Äù

I took a deep breath. I had some guesses.  

‚ÄúWerewolf?‚Äù

He curled his lip, but I noticed his eyes darken significantly. ‚ÄúVery‚Ä¶ original. Ten points for creativity.‚Äù

‚ÄúWerewolves freak out every full moon.‚Äù I said. 

He nodded, humoring me as he typed. Kaz was like an older brother. ‚ÄúUh-huh. They're also not real.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that far-fetched!""

Kaz stopped typing, raising a brow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure humans can‚Äôt turn into dogs under the full moon. You've been watching too many movies.‚Äù He shot me a look. ‚ÄúWeren't you like, *really* into Teen Wolf?‚Äù 

I put the controller down. ‚ÄúYou lock me in my room until morning.‚Äù I twisted to face him. ‚ÄúHow is that normal?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a precaution. You‚Äôve told us how weird we act, so it‚Äôs better to stay away from us.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd feel better if I was with you.‚Äù I swallowed. ‚ÄúSo, I know what‚Äôs really going on.‚Äù

Kaz‚Äôs expression seemed to change, relaxing slightly. He looked like he might reply, before Rowan came crashing in. Quite literally. 

That guy can‚Äôt walk two feet without falling or slamming into something. 

In this case, he tripped over the rug Immie had been vacuuming. I blamed the moon‚Äôs influence on him being more hyperactive than normal. Rowan oozed ADHD. 

Stumbling into the back of the couch, he grasped onto the back to stable himself. ‚ÄúWhat are you guys talking about?‚Äù

Kaz went back to typing with an exaggerated sigh. ‚ÄúNin thinks we‚Äôre werewolves.‚Äù

Rowan straightened up with a very nervous laugh. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWerewolves.‚Äù Kaz shut his laptop. ‚ÄúYou know, people who can turn into dogs? Honestly, I‚Äôm offended. I thought Nin was more creative than that. There‚Äôs a whole Wikipedia page on moon afflicted creatures, and she goes with the obvious.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, um, wowwwww.‚Äù Rowan chuckled. ‚ÄúTeen Wolf style?‚Äù

Kaz grinned. ‚ÄúTV show or 1980‚Äôs movie?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Rowan started clearing up the TV table, flipping through comic books.  ‚ÄúThey both suck.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat sucks?‚Äù Immie yelled from the kitchen.

‚ÄúTeen Wolf!‚Äù Rowan yelled back.

The girl made a sound of horror, and it was hard to hide my smile. 

‚ÄúTake that back!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad.‚Äù Rowan said, loud enough for her to hear. ‚ÄúYou forced me to watch an episode, and I fell asleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was after season 3!‚Äù Immie appeared in the doorway, wielding a spoon like she was going to attack him.

Gesturing wildly with the spoon, Immie was desperate to defend her lockdown guilty pleasure.

‚ÄúAfter season three it declined in quality. But it was still good! You liked the episode with the chess game!‚Äù

Rowan shrugged. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt change my overall rating.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you, IGN?‚Äù Immie turned and marched back into the kitchen and slammed the door.

It took maybe an hour for the two of them to get back on her good side.

See, I think about these moments, and I wonder why I‚Äôm writing this post.

I think I‚Äôm still in denial. I want to tell you thousands of reasons why they‚Äôre not bad people.

But then I remember what happened after that. I remember why I can‚Äôt talk to anyone else but an anonymous subreddit.

At around 10PM I found myself once again in my room going through the same routine.

This time, though, they wanted to be extra careful. Which meant a new addition to make sure I stayed there until dawn.

Rowan knelt in front of me. I couldn‚Äôt see the look in his eyes through his raybans, but I could tell he was wary.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù He fixed the headphones over my ears, jiggling them a little to make sure they were fitted properly.

I tugged at the handcuffs securing my left hand to the bed frame. ‚ÄúKinky.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just until morning, Nin.""

‚ÄúHandcuffs, though?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAre they really necessary?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. ‚ÄúRemember what you have to do?‚Äù

""Music on and blasting until I fall asleep.‚Äù

""And?""

""And I'm not coming out until morning.""

Rowan hummed. ‚ÄúLastly?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt remove the headphones.‚Äù

He jumped up. ‚ÄúAll right! Are you all set?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù I tried to smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got enough 80‚Äôs pop and sad indie to last me a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúAwesome.‚Äù

I tugged at the cuffs. ‚ÄúRowan, if something is going on, you can tell me.‚Äù

He didn't turn around. ""Really? Because, no offence, but I don‚Äôt think a pep talk will help.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I can try.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be locked up here every full moon because you‚Äôre scared of moonlight.‚Äù

I was startled when he sputtered out a laugh before getting close‚Äîtoo close‚Äîhis icy breath grazing my cheeks.

‚ÄúWell.‚Äù Rowan murmured, ‚ÄúMaybe if you weren‚Äôt a coward that day, things might be different. But here we are, Nin,"" He flicked me on the nose. ""Drunk on the fucking moon."" He exhaled in my face, and something warm crept up my throat. ‚ÄúQuite literally.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you a werewolf, Rowan?‚Äù I blurted. 

His entire demeanour changed suddenly. I felt him stiffen. 

I was used to his bad moods before the moon, but this was something different. 

This was hatred and resentment in its purest form shown in the twitch of his lips. 

I didn‚Äôt have to see his eyes. 

His smile through gritted teeth told me everything.

Slowly, Rowan tipped his head to the side, like he was feigning innocence. ‚ÄúWhat gave you *that* idea?‚Äù

Before I could reply, he climbed off the bed and offered me a two fingered salute, his lips twisting into a grin I knew was fake.

It made me wonder if I was wrong.

If the moon didn‚Äôt change them, instead bringing out their true feelings and selves. 

But that only brought more questions. 

He mentioned ‚Äúthat day‚Äù which was part of the endless blur of darkness, memories torn from me in my blackouts. 

Did something happen during one of those instances which had triggered them to act like this? 

With that question in my mind, I attempted to lunge from the restraints, but he was already at the door. 

‚ÄúNight.""

I didn‚Äôt reply. 

I knew not to entertain him when he was starting to feel the moon‚Äôs effects.

When the door slammed shut and I heard the twist of the key in the lock, I lay back and closed my eyes.

I considered tearing off the headphones and ignoring the rules, but that seemed petty.

Plus, I was tired.

I drifted off to music slamming in my ears. I still don‚Äôt know how I slept through it. 

I don‚Äôt know how long I was out for, but it couldn‚Äôt have been long. 

A few hours. 

I woke up feeling ravenously hungry, and yet hollow at the same time.

When I sat up, I noticed something felt‚Ä¶ wrong. 

I frowned at my toes for way longer than necessary until I realized one was missing. 

*I was supposed to have five toes on each foot*, my foggy mind murmured. 

I counted them twice, but there were only four. My pinkie toe was gone. 

After staring at it for a while, I blinked, and I could have sworn it appeared in flashes, like the flesh was knitting itself back together. I was seeing things. 

That‚Äôs what I told myself. Sleep paralysis was a thing, so I waited until I was fully with it, and when I was, my mind began to drink in my surroundings. The room was still dark, only lit up by my bedside lamp. 

I was in different clothes once more, and an empty glass of water stood on my bed stand. 

Something was different though. 

It was still dark outside, and I could just about glimpse a sliver of moonlight poking through the blinds.

Another thing which was different: My hand was no longer cuffed to my bed frame.

Sitting up, I stretched, and headed to the door. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to peek, I thought.

I reached out and grabbed the handle and twisted it, only for the door to swing open.

Weird. Wasn‚Äôt it locked?

They probably had some weird ritual to keep the moon out which Kaz found on Yahoo Answers.

Far too embarrassing for me to see.

Slowly, I made my way across the hall and passed the others rooms which were all silent. Which meant they were downstairs.

If I was honest with myself, I really didn‚Äôt want to deal with them if they were under the moon‚Äôs effects, but the rest of me was desperate to know what they had been hiding. 

Why was I sentenced to my room until dawn? 

The clock on rustic paintwork told me it was 1am as I slipped down the stairs, careful not to make noise. That meant I‚Äôd been asleep for around four hours. 

I heard voices when I reached the kitchen door. Immie was laughing, and Rowan made a hissing noise.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair. You always get the blue ones first and never give anyone a chance. I call bullshit.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, because you‚Äôre losing!‚Äù Immie shot back.

‚ÄúRowan‚Äôs right, though.‚Äù Kaz joined in. ‚ÄúYou do act territorial over Park Place and Boardwalk.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do not!‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least give someone else a chance to get the blue ones, Immie.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? I got them fair and square! You‚Äôre just calling me out because you‚Äôve got‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Rowan yelled. ‚ÄúHey, she can‚Äôt just do that!‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo hundred dollars left.‚Äù Immie sang. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre stuck in jail. I rest my case.‚Äù

Huh. They were playing Monopoly without me. So, they locked me in my room and played games till dawn?

That stung a little.

I could have walked away. I mean, they were having fun. I should have left them to tear themselves apart over a board game.

But I was grabbing the handle and twisting it, pulling open the door.

When I stepped into our kitchen, the first thing I saw was the impressive amount of property cards Immie had lain out in front of her, as well as the pile of cash sitting next to the board. I started to speak. 

I think I was going to congratulate Immie on her clear win, but the words choked up when my gaze continued across the table, this time settling on a small plastic container filled with red mush, which Kaz was sticking his fingers in and scooping into his mouth. The kitchen looked so familiar and yet different as my brain struggled to react with what I was seeing. 

Immie‚Äôs face was split into a manic grin because of her win, but there was something splattered on her lips and dripping from her chin. It wasn‚Äôt Immie I was looking at. It was what was in front of her, spread out like a main course, what she was tearing at like an animal.  

What was hanging out of Kaz‚Äôs mouth in slithering strands dyed scarlet and piled on Rowan‚Äôs plate. 

I was seeing flesh covering the table and them‚Äîand the floor. 

And they were stuffing themselves.

I thought it was raw chicken at first and had decided at that moment that they really had lost their minds. 

Then, though, I saw what was lying at their feet. I saw the torso first, which had been torn into, guts spilling out onto the floor. 

The body was an unrecognizable mass of skinned bone and pooling scarlet before I saw the face, and clumps of hair which had been ragged from the skull. 

I recognised that dirty blonde ponytail. Unbelievably, I was staring at myself. 

I was ahead of my brain at that moment. 

I was already seeing everything for what it was in a hazy red cloud, and my brain could do nothing.

It was me they were eating.

They were ripping me apart‚Äîgnawing on my bones.

Stuffing my guts into a plastic container and using me as dip.

I was paralysed. I looked at the window, at the duct tape blocking out the moon‚Äôs light.

So, this wasn‚Äôt an effect of the moon.

This was them.

This was all THEM.

Immie was the first to notice me. 

Her smile dampened, and she dropped what looked like stringy pieces of intestine clenched between her fists. 

My roommate's eyes widened, and for a moment she looked like she was on the edge of hysteria. ‚ÄúNin!‚Äù she squeaked, the mushy mess of guts slipping from her hands. ‚ÄúHey! Uh, this‚Ä¶. this‚Äî‚Äù

The girl was struggling, her eyes snapping to my body which had been hollowed out and cut into pieces on the floor.

Then, to Rowan‚Äôs plate filled with a red mush of blended whatever.

And whatever the fuck Kaz was sticking his fingers in. 

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt what it looks like.‚Äù Kaz finished for her. He stood up,  seeming calmer than the others.

Rowan was staring at me. 

His raybans pinned back dark curls, and his eyes didn‚Äôt seem angry or even fazed that I was seeing this. They only regarded me with amusement. 

Like he *wanted* me to find this. He looked torn whether to continue chewing on my flesh or try to explain.

‚ÄúNin.‚Äù Immie jumped up. ‚ÄúWe can explain.‚Äù She whispered. ‚ÄúOr‚Ä¶ or we can‚Äôt explain right now, but if you just let us‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúLet us what?‚Äù Rowan scoffed. ‚ÄúExplain? Yeah, we‚Äôre way past that point. ""Do you want to try explaining caf√© de Nin?‚Äù

He pointed to his chin. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a little of her small intestine there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Immie shot me a look, swiping at her chin with her sleeve. ‚ÄúNin, ignore him!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember my legs moving, but I was at the front door before I could release a breath.

They followed me, their thundering footsteps pounding behind me.

Now they were scared.

When I was so close to the door, so close to letting in that unearthly light, their expression‚Äôs turned fearful.

‚ÄúNin.‚Äù Kaz swiped blood from his mouth and chin.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt open that fucking door.‚Äù

Immie wrapped her arms around herself. ‚ÄúIs she here?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Rowan grumbled, shading his eyes. ‚ÄúAnd she won‚Äôt come, as long as that door stays shut.‚Äù

I found my voice. ‚ÄúWho are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúNobody.‚Äù Kaz said. ‚ÄúJust go back upstairs. We‚Äôll explain. I promise you. But you have to trust us.‚Äù

His tone was a warning.

‚ÄúTrust you?!‚Äù I managed to get out. ‚ÄúAre you fucking kidding me?‚Äù

It was funny.

How they wanted me to trust them when I saw what they had done to me.

I couldn‚Äôt speak, couldn‚Äôt breathe. 

I didn‚Äôt want an explanation or a scuffed excuse. I wanted out of there.

The rest is a sort of blur. I remember opening the door. Or at least I started to open it, and then I shut it again, panicking.

Their cries were enough to make me regret it. 

But it was too late. 

I watched their eyes fill up with that same unearthly light which bathed the sky. It was beautiful and terrifying the way their resolve crumbled in their eyes and lips. 

Scowls turned to whimsical smiles, and blood stained hands fell to their sides. 

The three of them headed back into the kitchen, and a sudden rhythmic knock on the front door startled me. 

I remember Rowan at the corner of my eye, rummaging around in a draw. 

Immie and Kaz stood behind him.

I risked going to the window and peeking out, but all I saw was the moon. 

The moon was right there, three inches from my face like it had encased the sky and oblivion beyond. For a moment I was taken aback at how beautiful she was. 

There she was bathing me in her light, in her glow, filling me with her song and her sweet words. And then a thud sounded behind me. 

Whatever had leached onto my mind let go, and I twisted to find Rowan on the ground in a rapidly growing pool of red. 

Her voice was in his head. Just like it was in mine. Another thud, and then another, almost in sync. Kaz and Immie followed. 

Their throats had been slit by their own fingernails fashioned into claws. 

When it hit me that my roommates  were dead, I was seeing her reflection in everything. In silverware which had been brought out from the draws‚Äîbleeding through the duct tape on the back window. 

I knew what I had to do.

 I had to get the cops. 

I was halfway upstairs when a blinding flash filled the hallway, followed by the sound. It sounded like a camera, like someone was taking a photo. 

When I grabbed my phone from my room, the moon lingered on the screen, growing larger until I swore she wasn‚Äôt just in reflective surfaces. She was at the corner of my eye, a half crescent quickly reaching totality the more I caught her shadow looming.

It was like a game she was playing. The more I caught her light, she only grew bigger.

After a hysterical freak-out with the cops, they came 5 minutes later.

Two officers followed me inside the house, one of them asking how many people were dead.

‚ÄúThree.‚Äù I kept saying. ‚ÄúMy roommates .‚Äù I was speaking in barely decipherable sobs. ‚ÄúMy roommates  are dead.

When I led them into the kitchen, however, bracing myself for the gory aftermath of what I saw, I was greeted by the three of them sitting on the floor, resuming their game of Monopoly. 

My body, as well as every piece of me was fucking gone.

The blood pooling on the floor, as well as staining their skin and faces‚Äîwas gone.

‚ÄúOfficers.‚Äù Rowan saluted the cops with his drink. I noticed a glitter of light in his eyes, in Kaz‚Äôs when he stood and folded his arms, his lips pulling into a smile. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù He shot a look at me. ‚ÄúNin, come on. We‚Äôre in the middle of a game.‚Äù

The officer standing behind me frowned. ‚ÄúWe were informed of a triple homicide.‚Äù He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúEverything seems to be relatively normal.‚Äù  Stepping in front of me, he was scowling. ‚ÄúMiss Caine, are you aware that wasting police time is a criminal offence?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were dead.‚Äù I said in a hiss. ‚ÄúI saw them. They were dead!""

‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù The second officer sighed, turning to Kaz.

‚ÄúIs your friend under the influence of drugs?‚Äù

‚ÄúOr too many scary movies?‚Äù The other scoffed.

Rowan jumped up. ‚ÄúUh, nope! No, we‚Äôre all good, officer!‚Äù 

When he came over and grabbed my arm, his grasp was strangely gentle. When I was leaning into it, however, I glimpsed something on his neck. At first I thought it was a tattoo, but it was engraved into his flesh. 

The number 2. 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not feeling great.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúWe, uh, we apologize for any crap caused.‚Äù

The cops didn‚Äôt say a word when they left, only muttering to each other about ‚Äústupid kids‚Äù.

I couldn‚Äôt face my roommates  after that. I went upstairs and splashed water on my face.

I was seeing things, I told myself.

I was going fucking crazy.

But then my fingers found the back of my neck, and I was twisting around, something acidic creeping up my throat.

Rowan‚Äôs neck displayed the number 2.

While mine had the number 27.

I went to bed after that. I was all ready to grab my things and leave while they slept, but when I risked standing on the top of the stairs, Kaz was in front of the door. 

It didn‚Äôt look like he was blocking it intentionally, but I wasn‚Äôt going to try.

This morning was awkward. That‚Äôs the only word I can think of to describe it.

My roommates  acted like nothing was wrong, like nothing happened. When I asked if the police had come back, Immie frowned at me over her oatmeal she hadn‚Äôt touched. ‚ÄúPolice?‚Äù Her eyes grew wide. ‚ÄúWait, did something happen last night?‚Äù

I was waiting for her to eat it, but she was just staring at it like it was sentient. 

I thought back to last night, watching her chewing through a mouthful of me, and I felt sick to my stomach.

‚ÄúDoubt it.‚Äù Rowan had his back to me, making coffee. ‚ÄúAll I remember is passing out after Monopoly.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter you lost.‚Äù Immie coughed. 

‚ÄúLast night doesn‚Äôt count.‚Äù 

Kaz grabbed a seat next to me. ‚ÄúAs far as we know, moon sensitivityTM didn‚Äôt get us, and Rowan let Imogen win Monopoly. Nin stayed in her room, and we survived another full moon.‚Äù 

He smiled. ‚ÄúCheers to that.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, Nin.‚Äù Rowan pushed past me when he took his plate to the dishwasher. ‚ÄúIf anyone knocks today, don‚Äôt fucking answer it.‚Äù

I noticed Immie stiffen up.

Kaz‚Äôs smile faded.

‚ÄúUnderstand?‚Äù Rowan said. ‚ÄúShut off all the lights.‚Äù

With no explanation, the others left for class after breakfast, and I planned my escape.

I wanted to pack up all my stuff, but instead I found myself scouring their rooms for anything which would confirm last night was real,  and I hadn‚Äôt fucking hallucinated it. But their rooms were exactly how I knew them. 

Immie‚Äôs was a total mess, covered in exotic plants she forgot to water, textbooks, a whole bookshelf dedicated to the horror genre, and every plushie you could think of. 

I looked under her bed, though there were just old snacks she‚Äôd forgotten to throw away and letters to her parents she had never sent.

I tried Rowan‚Äôs next, but it was more or less the same. I knew his room from movie nights I spent with him, though it still felt wrong going in there. Rowan‚Äôs room was perfect. Everything was in its place and was strangely symmetrical. 

His books were color coded and there was one singular Yoda plushie peeking from his bed covers. 

Under his bed were the usual things you‚Äôd find in a man‚Äôs room: Used tissues and odd socks. 

But there was nothing I‚Äôd consider weird.

Nothing that told me he was a cold blooded murderer.

I was losing motivation when I reached Kaz‚Äôs room at the end of the hallway. 

I expected the usual when I stepped inside, movie posters on the walls, and Japanese snacks littering the floor. 

There was that, of course. I knew Kaz well. 

But when I peeked under his bed, there was something wrapped in plastic. 

When I crawled further under, I saw through the plastic. I saw the same flesh from last night, pieces of torso and limbs ripped through and torn into. 

But there wasn‚Äôt just one of me. There were multiple mutilated bodies which all had my face squished against the plastic and pooling red. My cannibalised body stuffed into trash bags, my own dead eyes staring at me. 

My mind flashed back to the blinding light filling the hallway, and the sound of a photograph being taken.  

The moon following me, creeping behind me as I made my getaway upstairs to grab my phone to call the cops. 

My pinkie toe growing back right in front of my eyes. 

I know this sounds fucking crazy, but I think my roommates  are copying me.

That‚Äôs what the 27 means. I‚Äôve been copied 27 times.

Copied. Cloned. Whatever.

So they can eat me.

I am yet to go back home as I‚Äôm writing this. I‚Äôm planning to go back and get my stuff, but right now I can‚Äôt.

I want to blame all of this on them, but I keep thinking back to Rowan‚Äôs words.

‚ÄúThat night‚Äù I was a coward and left them, and somehow, these are the consequences.

What did I do to turn them into this? Rowan said this is my fault. It‚Äôs driving me crazy that I can‚Äôt remember it.

1gvenb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1gvenb5/i_think_this_woman_with_bpd_might_be_a_danger_to/,I think this woman with BPD might be a danger to me?,"Until recently, my only experience with BPD came from a female friend I once had who was diagnosed with it, and I had to cut ties with her.  

She said her symptoms manifested as wanting to punch people in the face, being quick to anger, but also in promiscuous relationships with other women, even though she had a male partner with whom she had kids (basically, risk-taking behaviour, high conflict, a lot of drama).  

I cut contact with her because her energy made me feel like she was draining me of my life force.  She was just so intense and made me feel suffocated and anxious.  It‚Äôs like I was some kind of target for her and she was on the way to becoming obsessed with me.  I‚Äôm a straight woman and wasn‚Äôt interested, but I genuinely felt predated on.  I haven‚Äôt spoken to her in years, not since blocking her.

So that‚Äôs all I knew about BPD.  Over the past year I had a traumatic relationship with a man who caused me a lot of trauma, cheated on me with both women and men despite pretending to be straight and monogamous.  One of his exes is diagnosed with BPD.

I cut ties with the man and went overseas to break the cycle and get away from him.  A couple of months in, I get a call from a ‚Äúno caller ID‚Äù.  Five calls.  Finally I answer, and it‚Äôs that man‚Äôs ex, the one with BPD.

She refuses to tell me how she got my number.  She tells me a story that makes it sound like she hasn‚Äôt seen that man in months, that she just wanted to contact me to commiserate with me because he abused her as well.  She asks if she can get a coffee with me when I‚Äôm back in town.  I‚Äôm gentle and kind with her because I‚Äôm uncertain, but it just feels like there‚Äôs something profoundly off about this woman.  

Her tone, the way she is speaking ‚Äî it feels staged and lethargic, and it also feels like she‚Äôs lying.  

So I end up contacting the man.  It turns out he had started sleeping with her again, and she had stolen his phone, and got my number out of it.  So she violated my privacy, lied to me about the context, and essentially re-traumatised me and lead to me having renewed contact with my abuser.  

Did he abuse her too?  Very likely.  But I would never in a million years have stolen his phone and violated a stranger‚Äôs privacy, refusing to tell them how I got their number, hiding my own number behind ‚Äúno caller ID‚Äù, calling multiple times in a row until they picked up.  And the only things she really told me were nasty things he had said about me to her.  So her call was fuelled by jealousy which she tried to play off as concern.

Is this fairly standard for people with BPD, and ‚Äî my main question, am I going to be safe when I go back to the city I live in that I share with these two people?  This woman knows my name and knows what I look like and knows what I do.  I don‚Äôt know her name or what she looks like or anything about her.  All I know is that she is a lot older than me and apparently a lot bigger than me.  

The man did take her to court to get a restraining order in the past.  He dropped it because he decided to start seeing her again.  Has anyone experienced women with BPD becoming violent and obsessive in a situation like this?

I have a public job in the sense that I‚Äôm a performing artist and I have to play shows as part of earning a living, and it would be very easy for this woman to find out when and where I‚Äôm playing.  Keeping in mind I have no idea what she looks like.

It all feels very unfair and the abusive man was totally unsympathetic and cared more about protecting his rekindled relationship with the woman than he did about my privacy or safety.

She was never a good person.,"READING, Pa. ‚Äî The search to fill in a weirdly untold story about Taylor Swift has become a medium-speed car chase. I‚Äôm in my vehicle, following this guy Joe in a red Mazda through the hills surrounding Reading, Pa., looking for Ronnie Cremer at DC Computer Repairs.

Swift‚Äôs ‚ÄúShake It Off‚Äù is blaring, and the song‚Äôs energy adds tension to the drive. It is fair to say we‚Äôre zipping, scooting through a few yellow lights. This is Joe‚Äôs style, apparently. He makes a sharp left into a McDonald‚Äôs; I pull beside him in the parking lot and roll down the window.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back, I‚Äôm just going to pick up my friend,‚Äù Joe says in a Queens-bred, wiseguy patter.

The Swift tale has been told endlessly, but never fully. Anyone with basic knowledge of pop culture can recite the cast of friends, exes and characters in her official bio: John Mayer, Lena Dunham, Joe Jonas, Karlie Kloss, Harry Styles.

But there is also the guy we‚Äôre racing to find. Ronnie Cremer. The man behind the myth. Or the man the myth forgot. Haven‚Äôt heard of him? Neither had I, until a few hours ago, at least not by name. But now there is an identity. And an address. And a sense that the story behind an icon is minutes away.

Joe ‚Äî more on him later ‚Äî is leading me. He emerges from the McDonald‚Äôs with a guy who he was supposed to meet for coffee, before he got wrapped up in this pursuit. He gets back in his car, and takes me to the computer store.

Ronnie is not in his office. He is out on a service call. So Joe and his friend take me back to McDonald‚Äôs, and we have coffee for about an hour.

I eventually return to the place alone and ask the nice woman at the desk if Ronnie is back yet. A man ‚Äî shaved head, black shirt, average height, roundish ‚Äî is standing behind her; he smiles and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been dreading this moment.‚Äù

The previous evening: Gray, 46 degrees, and foggy at the former Swift home on Grandview Blvd. in Wyomissing, Pa. The street is dead. If you‚Äôre from a suburb situated this many hours from a major city, you have sat staring out a window like this one, thinking something like, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a little girl in this little town/With a little too much heart to go around.‚Äù

That‚Äôs from the first song that Swift wrote, ‚ÄúLucky You.‚Äù People aching to taste more of the world will turn inward in a place like this, and plot an exit.

Swift has many times told a story that goes like this (from a 2009 promotional DVD):

‚ÄúWhen I was about 12 this magical twist of fate (happened). I was doing my homework [when the tech fixing my computer] looked over and saw the guitar in the corner. And he said, ‚ÄòDo you play guitar?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòOh. No. I tried, but . . . .‚Äô He said ‚ÄòDo you want me to teach you a few chords?‚Äô and I said, ‚ÄòUh, yeah. YES!'‚Äù

Which brings us to Ronnie Cremer and the moment he‚Äôs been dreading.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to burn any bridges,‚Äù he says, as we settle into two stools at the front of his street-level computer store. ‚ÄúBut at the same time, at some point it‚Äôs gonna be time.‚Äù

A reporter is here. So it‚Äôs time. Around us: computer monitors, cords, an acoustic guitar. Above us on the wall: A Taylor Swift platinum album ‚Äî a gift from Scott Swift, the singer‚Äôs dad.

Ronnie fixes computers, yes, but is also a respected local musician. That official story about the computer tech? Ronnie has seen Taylor recount it on many TV shows, and has wished to hear what he says is the full version:

‚ÄúThe first time I heard of Taylor, my brother had a theater company. They would have parties after the show, and they would do karaoke. My mom would attend these.‚Äù

Ronnie continues: ‚ÄúI only met Taylor face-to-face in 2002. I had a shop up in Leesport. It was a computer shop, and that‚Äôs where I had my little studio. My brother brought Taylor and her mom and her brother over and introduced me, and said, ‚Äòwould you be interested in recording a demo?‚Äô

‚ÄúIt was a couple cover songs. I recorded the demo for her. It wasn‚Äôt a great demo, but it was a demo.

‚ÄúAfter I did the demo, I was approached again by my brother, and by Andrea Swift. ‚ÄòWould I be interested in giving guitar lessons for Taylor? We‚Äôre trying to teach her how to play country music.‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know if I can teach country music. I don‚Äôt know the first thing about country music. I know rock music.‚Äô

‚ÄúBut eventually we did get together. They came out to my place once, but from there on in we met at her house in Wyomissing.‚Äù

And from there, Ronnie says, they continued working, two evenings a week, $32 per hour.

So, he never went over to fix her computer?

‚ÄúHonestly, it was probably months before I even looked at a computer for them,‚Äù Ronnie says.

‚ÄúI did do computer work for them, but the computer work eventually came after I started doing guitar work. It went from teaching her guitar, to teaching her how to structure songs.‚Äù

This is a perfectly fine story, but how does Ronnie feel about Swift‚Äôs shortened version?

‚ÄúI never wanted to be the person who always begrudged someone‚Äôs success,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd for whatever reason, and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm even mad at the Swifts. It‚Äôs just that their publicity team, that doesn‚Äôt sell as good: A 36-year-old bald guy taught her. That ain‚Äôt gonna work. If you say, he worked with her six hours a week, it was basically Tuesdays and Thursday from 5 to 8. That ain‚Äôt gonna sell.‚Äù

‚ÄúGrowth is betrayal. There is no other route. There is no arriving somewhere without leaving somewhere.‚Äù

That‚Äôs John Updike in ‚ÄúRabbit Redux.‚Äù He was from Shillington, Pa., and in a confluence of American legends who couldn‚Äôt quite shake this place, Swift grew up in the heart of Rabbit Angstrom country, too: Reading, Pa., and its surrounding hills, where Ronnie sits in his shop, wrestling with complex memories.

‚ÄúIn all honesty, I thought she was a pretty good student,‚Äù Ronnie says, still sitting on that stool at the front of his computer store.

‚ÄúWe started with G, D, E, A,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhere she had problems were the more difficult chords, the F‚Äôs and the B‚Äôs. F is really hard on the fingers, so I would teach her things like, ‚ÄòOK, if you want to play a song in F, play it in D and put the capo on the third capo.‚Äô So you notice when she plays, she still moves that capo around a lot.‚Äù

At first, progress was slow. ‚ÄúThe first couple months, I thought it was a joke,‚Äù Ronnie says. ‚ÄúI thought, here‚Äôs a bunch of rich people ‚Ä¶‚Äô

But Taylor kept at it, and they began working with Ableton Live, a computer program useful for songwriting and recording.

‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs your chorus. Here‚Äôs your verse. Move these around, and look what you‚Äôve got. You can write one verse, one chorus, and then you‚Äôve got a song.‚Äô That just clicked to her, and made sense.‚Äù

During this time, Ronnie was also trying to help build a website for Taylor, but says that Andrea Swift made that job difficult.

‚ÄúThat was eventually what led me to part ways with Andrea, because she was just like a bull in a china shop,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt drop what you were doing to work on whatever Taylor wanted, she would lose her mind.‚Äù

There were other glimpses of the household that struck Ronnie as darker.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt have a good relationship, the mother and father,‚Äù Ronnie says. ‚Äú(Scott) used to tell me‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòI got a wife that doesn‚Äôt love me. I‚Äôm trying to help my daughter out, and do all the right things, and my wife could care less.‚Äô So it was a weird dynamic.‚Äù

And this:

‚ÄúHer brother Austin, who was a little chubby at the time ‚Äî he‚Äôs not that now ‚Äî he wanted Taco Bell,‚Äù Ronnie recalls. ‚ÄúTaylor said, ‚ÄòI want Taco Bell, too.‚Äô And her mother went out and got Taco Bell, but only gave it to Austin because she said, ‚Äònobody wants to see a fat pop star.‚Äô She said that to Taylor. So Taylor had to eat a salad.‚Äù

The Swifts, through their publicist, declined multiple requests for comment.

Before finding Ronnie, there were false leads, which is how I met Joe. On the eve of my trip, a friend of the Swifts provided a tip: It wasn‚Äôt a computer tech at all who taught her guitar, but a pizza guy. And the pizza guy had never gotten any credit.

But it turns out this wasn‚Äôt quite right. Joe Piecora ‚Äî the guy who drives that speedy red Mazda ‚Äî is 63, a New Yorker who loves to talk and a onetime pizza man who also gave Swift guitar lessons for a year. But only after Ronnie had worked with her on chords. Joe‚Äôs task was to teach fingerstyle guitar. and in his telling, the student struggled.

Actually, it is not difficult to get Joe going on what he sees as the many myths of Taylor Swift. He doesn‚Äôt like her music, he doesn‚Äôt like the marketing, he doesn‚Äôt like the image-making.

‚ÄúYou ever hear the famous phrase Coal Miner‚Äôs Daughter?‚Äù Joe says. ‚ÄúI mean, basically, they‚Äôre trying to put a West Virginia spin on the Taylor Swift legend. Nobody buys a Christmas tree there.‚Äù

He is alluding to the official story that Taylor grew up on a Christmas tree farm. Defining her childhood home turns out to be a whole other caper. There are two places. One is a farm in Shillington. The exact tale, per locals, is that the Swifts grew and sold Douglas firs on a property they owned about a mile away. They also grew, but did not sell, trees behind their home. Close enough.

There‚Äôs the other place on Grandview Blvd. in tonier Wyomissing, set deep in a suburban housing tract 7 miles from the farm. It is a 5,000 square foot classical revival that sold in 2013 for $700,000, according to records. Scott Swift, a wealth management adviser and senior VP at Merrill Lynch, rented it for a time, and the family lived there.

Confused? You‚Äôre not alone. Even neighbors have all kinds of trouble pinning down when the Swifts lived where, and for how long. Everyone knows that they hustled off to Nashville in 2004, and rarely looked back.

It was on Grandview Blvd., not the whatever farm, where Ronnie and Joe gave the guitar lessons.

‚ÄúTaylor was the product of ‚Äî it‚Äôs like the stage parent, beauty pageant documentaries that you see,‚Äù is Joe‚Äôs view.

But this is not a tale of mean spirit. Like her music or not, there is something about Taylor Swift that connects. Deeply.

‚ÄúIt is really intense,‚Äù says Rolling Stone‚Äôs Rob Sheffield, who gave Swift‚Äôs ‚Äú1989‚Äù a four-star review and named it the No. 2 album of 2014. ‚ÄúShe is an absolutely fantastic live performer. The songs are from the heart and that comes across in performance, and that‚Äôs something that her fans connect to.‚Äù

Sheffield goes on to offer two hefty compliments. ‚ÄúShe is very Springsteen-like as a songwriter and a performer,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd also, she‚Äôs a bit like Carole King in terms of her craftiness as a songwriter ‚Ä¶ There isn‚Äôt anybody, at any age, consistently making records like this.‚Äù

Rewind to the 2006 FallFest in nearby Lancaster. A 9-year-old local singer named Stephanie Grace won a ‚ÄúKids Country Idol‚Äù contest run by a local radio station; the prize was to perform one song before the opening act at this annual festival.

The opening act was Taylor Swift, 16, returning home to promote her eponymous first album. The confessional style, the ability to connect with the crowd, as if she were reading from her diary, was already there. Swift was up on stage, just dishing.

‚ÄúI wrote this about a boy named Drew,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, and Stephanie thought, she‚Äôs just so open, I want to write like that.

Backstage, Taylor threw an arm around Stephanie, a pipsqueak in a white cowboy hat, and invited her behind the Swift table in the autograph tent.

Then Taylor looked right at the little girl and presented a gift that would last for the rest of her striving childhood: She took her seriously.

‚ÄúDo you write?‚Äù Taylor asked.

About six months later, Taylor was back in Reading to play at the local performing arts center. By then, she was blowing up, and the autograph line after the show was 300 deep. When Stephanie and her mom were sixth from the front, her mom did an embarrassing thing and said, ‚ÄúDo you remember Stephanie?‚Äù

Stephanie was like, ‚ÄòMom!‚Äô but Taylor smiled big, and connected again. ‚ÄúOf course, I remember! She was such a great singer.‚Äù

Stephanie is 18 now, working at getting out, shuffling between Nashville and Pennsylvania with the pic of herself and Taylor always in her iPhone.

That is real.

Andrew Orth is standing in a barn next to the Swift farm in Shillington. He is talking because he misses Taylor, and wants to reconnect. He is hoping that she reads this, and sees that he holds no grudge.

The barn is Orth‚Äôs photography studio, and it is behind the house where his mother would baby-sit Taylor and her brother for many years. A table in the studio holds a selection of the thousands of photos he shot of Taylor. Slides from when she was four; promotional shots from her first days in Nashville.

Orth, now 56 with a stubble beard and black rectangle glasses, lived in Los Angeles for two decades, shot prominent actors and directors, has a frame of reference that extends well beyond these Shillington hills.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about taking direction,‚Äù Orth says of being photographed. ‚ÄúSome people listen, and some people don‚Äôt. (Taylor) was in the zone. There are people who have a natural charisma, and no doubt, she had it.‚Äù

Orth is standing over the table of Swift, which takes her from childhood to the verge of stardom. He believes that he made a meaningful contribution to her image, which began during annual visits from L.A.

‚ÄúI would come back, and Taylor would come running over here, wrap her arms around my legs and say, you‚Äôre my favorite photographer,'‚Äù Orth says. ‚ÄúI guess she got the Hollywood disease. I don‚Äôt know what it was, but she thought it was the be-all and end-all, where I came from.‚Äù

He is disappointed to have lost touch, and hopes to reconnect and shoot her again.

‚ÄúShe was this beautiful little girl,‚Äù Orth says. ‚ÄúIf you can look beyond the shot, and understand that a little 4-year-old doesn‚Äôt do this sort of thing unless they‚Äôre listening so intently. When it came to shooting, we just totally connected, and it continued through the years.‚Äù

The relationship continued into the Swifts‚Äô early years in the Nashville suburb of Hendersonville, Tenn., where Orth would stay at the family home during his periodic trips.

And then? Well . . .

‚ÄúAs she got bigger, I kind of vanished,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSo yeah, there‚Äôs that element of ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs going on here?'‚Äù

Reality struck Orth in a Denny‚Äôs outside of Tulsa in 2007, during a cross-country drive home from L.A. Swift had given a concert in the area, and all the waitresses and cooks were wearing the same T-shirt purchased at the show. On it: Surprise! A photograph he had taken.

‚ÄúI remember having to take my hamburger to go,‚Äù Orth says. ‚ÄúI texted Andrea ‚Äògreat going, good luck.‚Äô And that was it.‚Äù

In the winter of 1961, an unknown who until recently had been named Robert Zimmerman rode into New York, carrying all kinds of myths. He was an orphan. He‚Äôd traveled across the country in a freight train. Anything to escape Hibbing, Minn., and write his way out of the tangle of details that made reality.

He created a person called Bob Dylan, who went onto become a protest singer, rocker, country gentleman, evangelist, you name it.

Taylor Swift hit Nashville in 2004 with her own tidy stories in development. At only 25, she has spent time as a country star, a pop queen, and now New York City‚Äôs ambassador for tourism, of all things. Icons have creation myths, and forever play characters. The great ones make it work over and over and over.

People in Wyomissing, Shillington and Reading are savvy. They understand all this. But when asked about the Swifts ‚Äî well, you can see what the answers contain. A complex blend of pride, yearning and resentment.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have cared if I ever got a dime,‚Äù Ronnie Cremer says, conceding that he has received the platinum album and a $5,000 guitar from the Swifts, and was paid for all the work he did for the family.

‚ÄúIt just would have been nice ‚Äî it would have helped me out if I would have just gotten a little bit of, Ronnie Cremer taught her. That would have been nice. That would have been a nice gesture.‚Äù",21,1732067025.0,travisandtaylor,5,0.96,False

**Macro:**

* **Geopolitical tensions took a step up**¬†as Ukraine made making its first ATACMS strike inside Russia.¬†In response, Russia‚Äôs foreign minister threatened a nuclear response. Risk off was short-lived however as US said that it sees no reason to adjust its nuclear posture in response to Russia‚Äôs decision.
* **Canada‚Äôs October CPI was a notch higher than expectations**, with the headline coming in at 2.0% YoY from 1.6% YoY in September and the trimmed core measure at 2.6% YoY from 2.4% YoY previously and expected. Bets for a 50bps cut in December were trimmed marginally, but still about 33bps of easing is priced in for BOC‚Äôs last meeting of the year.
* **On tap today:**¬†UK CPI, German PPI,¬†**Nvidia earnings**¬†(here is a¬†[trader‚Äôs guide for Nvidia earnings](https://social.saxo/x1qt3k1?uuid=aj7gC27)). Speakers: ECB President Lagarde, de Guindos; BoE‚Äôs Ramsden; Fed's Barr, Cook, Bowman & Collins.

**Equities:**¬†

* **US ‚Äì**¬†S&P 500 closed 0.4% higher despite geopolitical escalations after Ukraine made its first ATACMS strike inside Russia. Nvidia gained 4.9% ahead of its earnings report tonight.
* **Super Micro Computer**¬†led the S&P 500, surging 31.2% after it appointed an auditor and submitting a compliance plan to Nasdaq.
* **Walmart**¬†reported revenue and earnings that beat expectations while raising its forecast for this year. The stock gained 3.0% in today‚Äôs session to new highs.
* **Hong Kong**¬†\- HSI rose 0.4% due to positive Wall Street sentiment and Chinese VP He Lifeng's comments on Hong Kong's economic growth. Gains were led by tech and consumer sectors but were limited by caution ahead of the PBoC's rate review, with uncertainty about potential RRR cuts.
* **Earnings**¬†‚Äì Nio, Target, Nvidia, Snowflake, Palo Alto, Zim, Jack

**FX:**

* The¬†**US dollar got a safe-haven bid**¬†into the European open on Tuesday as geopolitical tensions flared up with Ukraine‚Äôs attack and Russia‚Äôs use of the N-word. However, the greenback returned lower subsequently as risk-off moves eased.
* **CAD outperformed**¬†with Canada‚Äôs CPI coming in higher and fuelling a slight hawkish repricing of the Bank of Canada expectations. USDCAD returned back below 1.40 handle and the 21DMA at 1.3924 could be the next key test. Saxo‚Äôs¬†[Trade Signals tool signals a possible bearish move in EURCAD](https://social.saxo/tl8dqfw?uuid=aj7gC27)¬†towards 1.4712 support.
* **AUD and NZD also remained strong**, and China‚Äôs LPR decision is up today. RBA‚Äôs minutes yesterday continued to signal a hawkish stance, but risk on sentiment will be key for activity currencies to extend their gains. Geopolitical tensions and Nvidia earnings could be a key gauge of risk sentiment in the day ahead. AUDUSD traded above 0.6540 and NZDUSD rose to 0.5920.
* **EURUSD marched above 1.06+ and GBPUSD drifted closed to 1.27**¬†handle in early Asian hours as risk-on moves extended. UK CPI is key ahead as the BOE is not expected to cut rates in December.

**Commodities:**

* **Gold**¬†rose 0.8% to over $2,630 as tensions escalated in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, prompting investors to seek safety in bullion.
* **WTI crude oil**¬†futures stayed near $69, influenced by geopolitical tensions. The Ukraine-Russia conflict escalated with Ukraine's use of Western missiles and Russia's expanded nuclear doctrine, while concerns in the Middle East eased.¬†**Brent crude**¬†fluctuated around $73.
* **Arabica coffee**¬†futures eased to $2.81 per pound, near a 13-year high, due to supply concerns and EU regulation uncertainty. Brazil's drought reduced crop prospects, delaying Intercontinental Exchange contract changes to 2025

**Fixed income:**

* **Treasury yields fell, particularly at the long end**, although they pulled back from the day's highest levels. This decline was initially spurred by increased risk aversion after Ukraine's first use of US missiles against Russia, which affected European stocks and briefly impacted US equities.

Now I'm thinking: Should I just start milling my own rough lumber? (I don't have a jointer, so I would have to use my straight-cut jig on the table saw.)

But I'm running the numbers, and buying S3S seems nominally more expensive?

At my local yard, for example:

Hard Maple:

* 4/4 RGH, $7.10/bf
* 4/4 S3S 13/16‚Äù, $7.75/bf
* 8/4 RGH, $8.00/bf
* 8/4 S3S 1-3/4‚Äù, $8.65/bf

Black Walnut:

* 4/4 RGH, $12.75/bf
* 4/4 S3S 13/16‚Äù, $13.50/bf
* 8/4 RGH, $14.50/bf
* 8/4 S3S 1-3/4‚Äù, $15.55/bf

If I spec out, say, a black walnut coffee table, it's only $25 more expensive to buy S3S vs. rough.

Thoughts on the pros and cons of buying rough vs. S3S?

For context: I just went through $400 worth of S3S maple, walnut, and cherry, and had enough to make a bathroom vanity, two nightstands, six cutting boards, a trivet, and a plant stand. (Plus some plywood, of course.)

Day 5 10:30pm
	‚Ä¢	Woke up feeling okay! Felt good all day until about 7pm, where I became tired and foggy. Went to work for first time since starting pill. 
	‚Ä¢	Disrupted sleep but less than night before. Vivid dreams. 

Day 6 8:30pm

	‚Ä¢	Slept better, still experienced some dreams. 


Week 1 Recap
Low energy, hard time making decisions, ungrounded, no appetite, foggy. First few days were hard but eased up over the week. Little to no sex drive (but in luteal phase). No major changes in mood stabilizing. 


Day 8 9:45pm
	‚Ä¢	Very lethargic today. Colors more vivid on walk. Went to baby gender reveal and had a great time. 
	‚Ä¢	Slept well, but still waking up with very low energy. 

Day 9 6:15pm
	‚Ä¢	Low energy is becoming frustrating. Feeling irritable, but likely due to PMS. No food is appetizing. Overall, uncomfortable. Seems like I have better evenings than mornings? 
	‚Ä¢	Still sleeping a lot, and waking up tired
 
Day 10 7:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Low energy, especially first few hours in the morning. First day of therapy, went well. Feeling irritable. 
	‚Ä¢	Slept well, still tired when waking up

Day 11 6:30pm
	‚Ä¢	Slight depression with low energy and motivation. Irrationally irritable. Feeling out of it by end of night. Getting period, likely playing a role. 
	‚Ä¢	Slept well, still tired when waking up 

Day 12 7:30pm
	‚Ä¢	Woke up with mild depression and low energy. In a fog today. 
	‚Ä¢	Slept well, trouble falling asleep (but did have caffeine later in the day)

Day 13 7pm
	‚Ä¢	No energy. Started period. Laid in bed all day!
	‚Ä¢	Slept okay, but a lot (almost 12 hours). 

Day 14 7pm
	‚Ä¢	Woke up with anxiety. I am beginning to hate the mornings. Felt good by noon and had a good gym session. 
	‚Ä¢	Slept okay, but a lot again. 


Week 2 Recap
Low energy in the morning for the first few hours I am awake. Gets slightly better by mid afternoon. Sleep has improved (not many interruptions or vivid dreams) - rarely wake up in night. Still no major appetite but eating okay. May have experienced some minor depression and anxiety but nothing debilitating.


Day 15 5:30pm
	‚Ä¢	Therapy day 2. Brought up some anxiety. Felt okay energetically most of the day. Curious to start taking pill a little earlier in the day / how that will make me feel in the mornings. 
	‚Ä¢	Slept well

Day 16 4:15pm
	‚Ä¢	Woke up slightly less groggy? Had check in w/ Dr. He suggested trying new med due to exhaustion. I said I wanted to wait it out another week. 
	‚Ä¢	Slept well, trying to get back to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äùsleep schedule
 
Day 17 3:15pm
	‚Ä¢	Election results are in. Depressing. Road trip today and experienced pretty intense anxiety. It passed after about an hour, and I had a great day afterwards. 
	‚Ä¢	Slept okay, minor disruptions due to not being at my own house. 

Day 18 1:30pm
	‚Ä¢	Woke up less groggy today. I think switching the pills back to day time is the right move. A bit tired today, but not debilitated. Improvements?

Day 19 12:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Woke up tired, but my sleep schedule is still off. Low energy most of the day, which is disheartening because I thought I was on a track of improvement. 

Day 20 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Woke up groggy. Took a class today and at first had a hard time concentrating but was able to hone in eventually. 

Day 21 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Still having a hard time feeling ‚Äúalert‚Äù the first few hours in the morning. Pretty groggy today. Felt nauseous about 3 hours after pill.   Disassociating? Overall not a great feeling day. 


Week 3 Recap
Sleeping fine, but always waking up in the morning feeling like I could sleep 5 more hours. Saw a friend who said I looked very out of it. Overall I‚Äôm feeling stable in my mood, and my biggest complaint is low energy. I‚Äôve also noticed I‚Äôm very indecisive, almost paralyzed when it comes to choices. Hard time concentrating. 


Day 22 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Consistent low energy. Didn‚Äôt do anything all day. I am going to devote this week to resting.

Day 23 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Woke up feeling a little better today! Still tired, but not as groggy. Slept about 11 hours‚Ä¶
	‚Ä¢	Went for a long walk. Got a facial. Enjoyed myself. Feel like it‚Äôs turning for the better. 

Day 24 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Energy level slowly improving. Feel like I‚Äôm on autopilot today though. Therapy session today went well. 

Day 25 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Feel pretty good today! Had minor panic when out at the grocery store, but it passed quickly. Went lap swimming and was satisfied with my overall energy level!
	‚Ä¢	Disrupted sleep

Day 26 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Felt good today
	‚Ä¢	Disrupted sleep again, waking up around 5am. Wondering if this is linked and if I should take medication at a slightly different time?

Day 27 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Starting to feel excited to start new job!! Extra sweaty today (just armpits)?
	‚Ä¢	Woke up early, naturally!

Day 28 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Went to the beach today. Had a good day! Tired about an hour after taking med, but think that is also because I did an afternoon coffee (crash). 


Week 4 Recap
Overall I felt a slow shift in energy level. Sex drive is lower than normal, but no problems surrounding that. Sweating more than usual? Overall, best week yet. 


Day 29 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	First day new job! Went well! Went swimming afterwards. Good energy and concentration levels. 

Day 30 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Feeling even and stable. Not numb, but like I can handle my emotions rather than them handling me.

an important thing to add is that this friend and i used to be very very close. like seeing each other almost every day and hanging out very often. we drifted apart a bit this year just because our schedules (especially hers) are so busy. things have been a bit tense with us this year as well, because i haven‚Äôt felt like she is putting much effort in to keeping our friendship alive. in the beginning, i was definitely overreacting. i was very anxious at the beginning of this year because we weren‚Äôt hanging out much and she‚Äôd made all these new friends, and she kept cancelling on me and even forgot about our plans a few times. and every time we did hangout, she would cut it short after less than an hour most of the time, even if we hadn‚Äôt hung out for a couple weeks. but i put all of that behind me and decided i was being the dramatic one, not everyone is required to be the kind of friend i am. not everyone is going to have as much to give as i do. she is very very busy. 

anyway back to the main point. it‚Äôs the morning of my birthday and we met for coffee at 11, and like just over an hour in and she has to go home to get ready for her event at 3. so i just wonder am i over reacting?? like we hadn‚Äôt hung out in a bit and it was my birthday. couldn‚Äôt she have gotten ready for the event beforehand? i just feel like she doesn‚Äôt really like me anymore. i‚Äôm not even mad at her, i just want to know what ive done wrong, and why it seems like she just doesn‚Äôt want to be around me recently. we only hangout when I make the plans. oh and also, earlier this year, the guy she was talking to cut things off with her and she called someone else. she didn‚Äôt even call me about it, and i would‚Äôve definitely called her in that situation. i don‚Äôt know, i guess im just sad and mourning this friendship. 

am i way over reacting or do you guys thing she really is just super busy, and just doesn‚Äôt have social energy?",2,1732066459.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Another one of THESE posts about making friends in Rochester. 

I am 33M and my wife is 35F. Looking for friends. Either a couples thing or just a solid friend for me to game/watch sports/hang with. Disclaimer: absolutely NOT interested in swinging or anything sexual. Truly no judgement if that's your thing. It's personally not our thing.

**Both of us:** we have two wonderful dogs who are our kids. We do not have children, and are not planning on having them for a multitude of reasons, although we do love kids. We both lean pretty left and I'd say that we'd probably both be more compatible with similar minded people. We both dabble/experiment with drugs a little. She is a little more adventurous than me. Right now we're mainly on THC drinks, but we have also been known to take some mushroom chocolates and even tried microdosing on acid on a trip to Denver this year. 

We love being super aunts and uncles. Love our friends kids too - we definitely have more time then them these days, and are looking for some friends to spend it with. 

Me: I am big into sports. I play a lot of tennis and pickle, I box a bit (not seriously, more fitness/class format) and play golf, although I am not very good and that was more of a covid hobby. I'm a bit of a nerd, I think - and I think nerdy stuff is cool. I am a software analyst - I love video games and board games, food and my own weird data pet projects. I love sports - huge Broncos fan (Bills are great too, lol). Not a huge gambling guy but do like placing an occasional prop bet and playing fantasy football, collecting sports cards.  Really into video games on Xbox - Baldur's Gate, R6 Siege, Battlefield, Madden, other games. Baldur's Gate was an eye opener for me and I think D&D is pretty cool. I'm also a big coffee guy, although I think the hobby is sort of intimidating and hard to get really into.  Do like going to Blues Night at the Archive as well.

My wife is a former college lacrosse player, she loves her trashy reality TV - she's not a gamer/as nerdy as me but she is The Best‚Ñ¢, which is great! She loves her spin class, pilates and travel/eating locally and is a pretty damn good monopoly go player, although I am making up ground. I am trying to get her into tennis, which she has enjoyed so far.

She is a local, so she has her established group of friends. I am a transplant so I've become friends with some of her circle, but I have struggled to find my own friends.

Financially he is in good shape and if a new car can keep him driving (safety) for longer then money is not an issue.

1gvdu9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gvdu9a/aitah_for_telling_my_roommate_that_she_is_not_my/,AITAH for telling my roommate that she is not my responsibility and i don't owe her anything?,"I feel like I am going crazy, and thus, I need to come to Reddit.

I will preface this with I have a tough time saying no to people. I am a people pleaser and like doing things for people I care for. This makes for a deadly cocktail for getting screwed over, I've found. So, I became roommates in a 3X2 apartment with some previous friends. I will refer to them as Amelia(20F) and Isabella(21F). For the past three months, I have been screwed over multiple times: a 125-dollar Sam's Club visit that neither paid me back for, borrowing cash to go out and never being paid back for, breaking my makeup when borrowed, not returning clothes that they have borrowed. The one that irks me the most is the amount I drive them around. They don't have cars, and I've driven Amelia to class twice a week for a whole semester and driven them home for breaks, grocery store visits, home from night outs, and other people's houses. I drive them around constantly; they have never offered me gas money. Now I know I should ask for it, and that's on me. My therapist tells me all the time. Here's where the problem started, and I may be the asshole.

In my baby steps attempt to start setting boundaries and saying no, I stopped offering to drive them places or let them use my things when they would bait me to allow them to instead of asking. I bring another friend to the grocery store, and she asks and always buys me coffee as ""payment."" I recently started going with her and waiting for my roommates to ask me. Isabella has begun to ask when she needs to go, and I only offer to bring them to the grocery store that is a five-minute drive away. They don't give me gas money, so we aren't going far or to places where they need my membership card to check out. Thus, they want to do it together, and I end with the tab. Amelia isn't available when Isabella and I are available; for some reason, she won't allow us to find some compromise. This has happened twice now, and we went without her. Isabella offered to get the things Amelia needed, and I did not because Amelia was the one who had never even tried to pay me back. She has made a massive deal about how her other friend had to bring her. She then asked me if she could drive my car to the grocery store when she couldn't go with us, and I said hell fucking no, which upset her, and apologized for being crass, but she was out of line for even asking.

This has been boiling and is now bubbling over today. About a week ago, Amelia was baiting me to let her use my shampoo and conditioner. Going on and on about how expensive shampoo and conditioner are and how she's so broke. I didn't bite. She continued for the next couple of days, and I didn't say she could use mine, and I put them in my room. My shampoo is costly, and I use it sparingly because of that. I wash my hair once a week, and my roommate washes hers daily. I had a gut feeling that after she ""borrowed"" my lotion until it was gone,  she would do the same to my shampoo and conditioner. She finally outright asked me, and I said no. She got upset and didn't talk to me for a day or two. This is how she would guilt me into letting her use my stuff. She would always talk about how lucky I am to have the things I have. Most of my clothes, makeup, and shoes have been purchased by myself. She talks about her upbringing and how she could never afford the things that I have. A single mother raised me and was by no means rich and barely lower middle class. I got a job when I was 15 and devoted much more time than I should have as a young teen to work since then. I've had multiple jobs at once and insane hours because I like nice things. I paid for pretty much everything I have except for my car. I am very grateful for my car, and that's why I don't have a problem with taking time out of my day to drive people around. I know that it is a luxury. I drive coworkers home, my other friends to work, etc. Everyone besides my roommates either offers gas money or some sort of payment through food or drinks. I rarely take the gas money; their offering is enough for me. 

So here's where the confrontation started. I was doing my laundry, and she asked me why I was using her detergent purchased by ME when we went to Sam's Club. It set me over my limit, and I listed all the shared shit in our apartment that was purchased by me. They use it‚Äîincluding but not limited to toilet paper, paper towels, laundry and dish detergent, trash bags, candles and wax melters, the vacuum, and all the condiments in the apartment. She threw her other friend, having to drive her to the grocery store, the length of my showers, how loud I am going into my room after I'm off work and anything she could say to bitch and moan. That's when I told her she could go and buy her shit, and I wasn't going to share anything of mine with her. I told her how much money she owed me from ""borrowing it."" I told her she needed to give me the pillows I purchased when we went on that Sam's Club trip, and she needed to provide me with anything she had ever borrowed from me. Amelia said that because we are roommates, I'm supposed to do all this stuff. I told her that her going to the grocery store was not my fucking problem and I didn't owe her anything so she could stop using my shit. She said that I was a raging and arrogant bitch. Our other roommate is ""staying out of it,"" but I overheard them talking shit when they ""didn't realize I was home.‚Äù I've asked some of my friends, and they don't think I'm the asshole, but mutual friends said that I should be the one to drive her places, and sharing stuff is all a part of being roommates, and when I don't offer to bring them when I'm going with my other friend is rude.

So, AITA, is this something I should try to return from? We don't cross paths with busy class schedules and how much I work.

	‚Ä¢	Slept well, but still waking up with very low energy. 

Day 9 6:15pm

	‚Ä¢	Slept well, still tired when waking up

Day 11 6:30pm

	‚Ä¢	Slept okay, but a lot again. 


Week 2 Recap
Low energy in the morning for the first few hours I am awake. Gets slightly better by mid afternoon. Sleep has improved (not many interruptions or vivid dreams) - rarely wake up in night. Still no major appetite but eating okay. May have experienced some minor depression and anxiety but nothing debilitating.


Day 15 5:30pm
	‚Ä¢	Therapy day 2. Brought up some anxiety. Felt okay energetically most of the day. Curious to start taking pill a little earlier in the day / how that will make me feel in the mornings. 
	‚Ä¢	Slept well

Day 16 4:15pm
	‚Ä¢	Woke up slightly less groggy? Had check in w/ Dr. He suggested trying new med due to exhaustion. I said I wanted to wait it out another week. 
	‚Ä¢	Slept well, trying to get back to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äùsleep schedule
 
Day 17 3:15pm

	‚Ä¢	Slept okay, minor disruptions due to not being at my own house. 

Day 18 1:30pm
	‚Ä¢	Woke up less groggy today. I think switching the pills back to day time is the right move. A bit tired today, but not debilitated. Improvements?

Day 19 12:00pm

Week 3 Recap
Sleeping fine, but always waking up in the morning feeling like I could sleep 5 more hours. Saw a friend who said I looked very out of it. Overall I‚Äôm feeling stable in my mood, and my biggest complaint is low energy. I‚Äôve also noticed I‚Äôm very indecisive, almost paralyzed when it comes to choices. Hard time concentrating. 


Day 22 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Consistent low energy. Didn‚Äôt do anything all day. I am going to devote this week to resting.

Day 23 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Woke up feeling a little better today! Still tired, but not as groggy. Slept about 11 hours‚Ä¶

	‚Ä¢	Energy level slowly improving. Feel like I‚Äôm on autopilot today though. Therapy session today went well. 

Day 25 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Feel pretty good today! Had minor panic when out at the grocery store, but it passed quickly. Went lap swimming and was satisfied with my overall energy level!
	‚Ä¢	Disrupted sleep

Day 26 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Felt good today
	‚Ä¢	Disrupted sleep again, waking up around 5am. Wondering if this is linked and if I should take medication at a slightly different time?

Day 27 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Starting to feel excited to start new job!! Extra sweaty today (just armpits)?
	‚Ä¢	Woke up early, naturally!

Day 28 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Went to the beach today. Had a good day! Tired about an hour after taking med, but think that is also because I did an afternoon coffee (crash). 


Week 4 Recap
Overall I felt a slow shift in energy level. Sex drive is lower than normal, but no problems surrounding that. Sweating more than usual? Overall, best week yet. 


Day 29 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	First day new job! Went well! Went swimming afterwards. Good energy and concentration levels. 

Day 30 3:00pm
	‚Ä¢	Feeling even and stable. Not numb, but like I can handle my emotions rather than them handling me.

They say your soulmate is out there, somewhere, waiting for you. For years, I laughed it off, brushing aside the idea of destiny and soul connections as something you‚Äôd find in a cheesy romance novel. But deep down, a part of me craved that certainty‚Äîthe belief that someone, somewhere, was made just for me. And when I stumbled upon this online service, offering to sketch and describe my soulmate based on astrological insights, curiosity got the better of me.

At first, I was skeptical. I mean, how could someone I‚Äôd never met tap into my life and tell me who I was destined to be with? It seemed too good to be true. But the reviews were glowing, and for the price of a nice dinner, I figured, why not? If nothing else, it‚Äôd be a fun distraction.

The process was surprisingly easy. I entered some basic information‚Äîbirth date, time, place‚Äîand hit submit. Within 48 hours, I received an email that changed my perspective forever.

There it was: a hand-drawn sketch of a man who looked so real, so vivid, it was as if the artist had plucked him from my future and placed him on paper. But that wasn‚Äôt all. Attached to the image was a detailed narrative‚Äîa story of how we might meet, the energy we‚Äôd share, and even the challenges we might face. It wasn‚Äôt vague or generic like a fortune cookie. It felt intimate, as though this stranger on the other side of the screen had peered into my soul.

Here‚Äôs where it gets eerie. A few weeks later, I was at a local coffee shop, thumbing through a book I‚Äôd picked up on a whim. I glanced up‚Äîand there he was. The same eyes, the same jawline, even the same unruly hair. My heart stopped. Could it be? I couldn‚Äôt ignore the coincidence. We locked eyes, exchanged smiles, and before I knew it, we were deep in conversation.

His name was Alex, and he was visiting my city for a work project. As we talked, it felt like we‚Äôd known each other forever. Everything about him matched the description I‚Äôd received, down to the quirky sense of humor and his love for adventure. Over the next few weeks, we became inseparable, and every moment felt like the universe was nudging us closer together.

I won‚Äôt claim that this service was some kind of magical portal to my soulmate, but I will say this: it opened my mind. It made me believe, even just a little, that I was worthy of a deep, soulful connection. It reminded me to pay attention to the signs, to trust my instincts, and to embrace the serendipity of life.

Today, Alex and I are building a life together. I still have that sketch tucked away in a drawer, and every time I look at it, I‚Äôm reminded of the power of belief. Whether you call it fate, astrology, or just a lucky guess, there‚Äôs something profound about daring to dream and putting that energy into the universe.

This experience didn‚Äôt just bring me closer to love; it taught me to trust in possibilities I once dismissed. It‚Äôs funny how a small leap of faith can lead to the most extraordinary outcomes. For anyone who‚Äôs on the fence about trying something new or unconventional, let this be your sign: take the leap. You never know what might be waiting on the other side.

Now, you might be wondering: is there any science behind something like this? Can a service really use astrology, intuition, or artistic interpretation to connect you with someone who could be your soulmate? At first glance, it feels like a leap of faith, but when you dig deeper, there are some fascinating ideas that bridge the gap between the mystical and the scientific.

First, let‚Äôs talk about the concept of synchronicity‚Äîa term coined by psychologist Carl Jung. Synchronicity refers to meaningful coincidences that seem too perfect to be random. When you receive a detailed sketch and description of a potential soulmate, your brain naturally starts looking for connections. This isn‚Äôt just wishful thinking; it‚Äôs how the human mind works. Our brains are wired to find patterns, to make sense of the world around us. By introducing the idea of your soulmate, the service primes your subconscious to be more open to possibilities you might have otherwise ignored.

For example, let‚Äôs say the description mentions someone with a warm smile and an adventurous spirit. The next time you meet someone who fits that profile, your mind flags it as significant. That heightened awareness might lead you to strike up a conversation or notice details you‚Äôd typically overlook. In a way, the service acts as a catalyst, sparking your awareness and encouraging you to trust your instincts.

There‚Äôs also a growing body of research in psychology around the power of visualization and belief. Studies show that when people visualize a specific outcome‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs achieving a goal, finding love, or overcoming challenges‚Äîthey‚Äôre more likely to take actions that align with that vision. This doesn‚Äôt mean the universe magically rearranges itself to make your dreams come true, but it does mean that belief shapes behavior, and behavior shapes outcomes. By receiving a vivid sketch and story of your soulmate, you‚Äôre essentially creating a mental roadmap for love.

Then there‚Äôs the artistic element. The human face is incredibly powerful in evoking emotion and connection. Seeing a tangible image of someone who could be your soulmate taps into that innate longing for connection. Even if you don‚Äôt believe in astrology or psychic insights, there‚Äôs no denying the emotional impact of seeing a face that feels familiar and comforting. It‚Äôs like giving form to a dream you‚Äôve held in your heart for years.

Astrology, while often dismissed as pseudoscience, also has its roots in an ancient understanding of human behavior and cycles. Whether or not you believe the stars can influence your life, astrology operates as a tool for self-reflection. By analyzing your birth chart, the service can reveal patterns and tendencies that might help you better understand yourself and what you‚Äôre looking for in a partner. This isn‚Äôt so much about fate as it is about aligning with your own values and desires.

What‚Äôs fascinating is how this blend of psychology, art, and intuition creates an experience that feels deeply personal. It‚Äôs not just about finding someone who fits the description; it‚Äôs about opening yourself up to the idea of love, paying attention to the moments that matter, and trusting your gut when you feel a connection.

At the end of the day, the science of Soulmate Story isn‚Äôt about proving or disproving the existence of soulmates. It‚Äôs about harnessing the tools we have‚Äîvisualization, pattern recognition, self-reflection‚Äîto create a mindset that‚Äôs open to possibility. Whether you call it science, art, or magic, there‚Äôs no denying the transformative power of belief.

Looking back, I can‚Äôt say for sure that fate brought Alex into my life. But I can say this: the process made me more aware, more hopeful, and more ready to embrace love when it found me. And isn‚Äôt that the real magic? Sometimes, the science we‚Äôre looking for isn‚Äôt in the stars or the sketch‚Äîit‚Äôs in ourselves.

**1. How does the process work?**  
It‚Äôs straightforward and user-friendly. You provide your birth details‚Äîdate, time, and location‚Äîand answer a few simple questions. Based on this information, the service generates a personalized sketch of your soulmate along with a detailed narrative describing their personality, where you might meet, and what kind of connection you‚Äôll share.

**2. Is it accurate?**  
Accuracy depends on how you define it. While the sketch and description are based on astrological insights and artistic interpretation, their value lies in how they open your mind to possibilities. For me, the description was eerily close to reality, but it‚Äôs important to view this as a tool for inspiration and self-reflection rather than a guarantee.

**3. How long does it take?**  
The turnaround time is usually quick, often within 24‚Äì48 hours. You‚Äôll receive your sketch and narrative via email, making it a seamless process that doesn‚Äôt require any additional steps on your part.

**4. Is this based on astrology or something else?**  
The service combines elements of astrology, intuition, and artistic skill. Your astrological chart forms the foundation, providing insights into your personality and potential compatibility. This is then paired with an intuitive artistic process to create a detailed and personalized result.

**5. What if I don‚Äôt resonate with the sketch or description?**  
This is a common concern. If the sketch or description doesn‚Äôt immediately resonate, don‚Äôt be discouraged. Think of it as an exercise in broadening your perspective. Sometimes, the connections become clear over time, or they help you uncover qualities you‚Äôre truly seeking in a partner.

**6. Can I use this even if I‚Äôm skeptical?**  
Absolutely. Many people approach it with a healthy dose of skepticism, and that‚Äôs okay! You don‚Äôt have to believe in astrology or soulmates to benefit from the process. At the very least, it‚Äôs a fun and engaging way to reflect on what you want in a relationship and stay open to possibilities.

**7. Is it worth the money?**  
For me, it was worth every penny‚Äînot just because of the result but because of the journey it inspired. Whether you view it as entertainment, self-discovery, or a potential glimpse into your future, the cost is relatively low compared to the value it can bring.

**8. What makes this different from a regular psychic reading?**  
This service is unique because it combines multiple elements‚Äîastrology, art, and storytelling‚Äîto create something highly personalized. Instead of vague predictions, you get a tangible sketch and a specific narrative that feels tailored to you.

**9. Is this service for everyone?**  
If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs open-minded, curious, and eager to explore new ways of thinking about love, this is for you. If you prefer concrete guarantees or aren‚Äôt open to the idea of soulmates, it might not be the best fit.

**10. What if I‚Äôve already met my soulmate?**  
Even if you‚Äôre already in a relationship, the service can provide valuable insights into the qualities you value in a partner and deepen your understanding of your connection. Many users find it to be a fun and reaffirming experience, whether they‚Äôre single or not.

1gvdiio,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OvenGroundbreaking95/comments/1gvdiio/mlk_jr_letter_from_birmingham_jail/,MLK Jr. - Letter from Birmingham Jail ,"by Martin Luther King, Jr. From the Birmingham jail, where he was imprisoned as a participant in nonviolent demonstrations against segregation, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote in longhand the letter which follows. It was his response to a public statement of concern and caution issued by eight white religious leaders of the South. Dr. King, who was born in 1929, did his undergraduate work at Morehouse College; attended the integrated Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, one of six black pupils among a hundred students, and the president of his class; and won a fellowship to Boston University for his Ph.D. WHILE confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling our present activities ""unwise and untimely."" Seldom, if ever, do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all of the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would be engaged in little else in the course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I would like to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms. I think I should give the reason for my being in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the argument of ""outsiders coming in."" I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every Southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty-five affiliate organizations all across the South, one being the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Whenever necessary and possible, we share staff, educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago our local affiliate here in Birmingham invited us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct-action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promises. So I am here, along with several members of my staff, because we were invited here. I am here because I have basic organizational ties here. Beyond this, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the eighth-century prophets left their little villages and carried their ""thus saith the Lord"" far beyond the boundaries of their hometowns; and just as the Apostle Paul left his little village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to practically every hamlet and city of the Greco-Roman world, I too am compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my particular hometown. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid. Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial ""outside agitator"" idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider. You deplore the demonstrations that are presently taking place in Birmingham. But I am sorry that your statement did not express a similar concern for the conditions that brought the demonstrations into being. I am sure that each of you would want to go beyond the superficial social analyst who looks merely at effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. I would not hesitate to say that it is unfortunate that so-called demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham at this time, but I would say in more emphatic terms that it is even more unfortunate that the white power structure of this city left the Negro community with no other alternative. IN ANY nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices are alive, negotiation, self-purification, and direct action. We have gone through all of these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying of the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of police brutality is known in every section of this country. Its unjust treatment of Negroes in the courts is a notorious reality. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in this nation. These are the hard, brutal, and unbelievable facts. On the basis of them, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the political leaders consistently refused to engage in good-faith negotiation. Then came the opportunity last September to talk with some of the leaders of the economic community. In these negotiating sessions certain promises were made by the merchants, such as the promise to remove the humiliating racial signs from the stores. On the basis of these promises, Reverend Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to call a moratorium on any type of demonstration. As the weeks and months unfolded, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. The signs remained. As in so many experiences of the past, we were confronted with blasted hopes, and the dark shadow of a deep disappointment settled upon us. So we had no alternative except that of preparing for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and national community. We were not unmindful of the difficulties involved. So we decided to go through a process of self-purification. We Letter From Birmingham Jail 2 started having workshops on nonviolence and repeatedly asked ourselves the questions, ""Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?"" and ""Are you able to endure the ordeals of jail?"" We decided to set our direct-action program around the Easter season, realizing that, with exception of Christmas, this was the largest shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic withdrawal program would be the by-product of direct action, we felt that this was the best time to bring pressure on the merchants for the needed changes. Then it occurred to us that the March election was ahead, and so we speedily decided to postpone action until after election day. When we discovered that Mr. Conner was in the runoff, we decided again to postpone action so that the demonstration could not be used to cloud the issues. At this time we agreed to begin our nonviolent witness the day after the runoff. This reveals that we did not move irresponsibly into direct action. We, too, wanted to see Mr. Conner defeated, so we went through postponement after postponement to aid in this community need. After this we felt that direct action could be delayed no longer. You may well ask, ""Why direct action, why sit-ins, marches, and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are exactly right in your call for negotiation. Indeed, this is the purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and establish such creative tension that a community that has consistently refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. I just referred to the creation of tension as a part of the work of the nonviolent resister. This may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly worked and preached against violent tension, but there is a type of constructive nonviolent tension that is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must see the need of having nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men to rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. So, the purpose of direct action is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. We therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in the tragic attempt to live in monologue rather than dialogue. One of the basic points in your statement is that our acts are untimely. Some have asked, ""Why didn't you give the new administration time to act?"" The only answer that I can give to this inquiry is that the new administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one before it acts. We will be sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Mr. Boutwell will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is much more articulate and gentle than Mr. Conner, they are both segregationists, dedicated to the task of maintaining the status quo. The hope I see in Mr. Boutwell is that he will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from the devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. History is the long and tragic story of the fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups are more immoral than individuals. We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have never yet engaged in a direct-action movement that was ""well timed"" according to the timetable of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word ""wait."" It rings in the ear of every Negro with a piercing familiarity. This ""wait"" has almost always meant ""never."" It has been a tranquilizing thalidomide, relieving the emotional stress for a moment, only to give birth to an ill-formed infant of frustration. We must come to see with the distinguished jurist of yesterday that ""justice too long delayed is justice denied."" We have waited for more than three hundred and forty years for our God-given and constitutional rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward the goal of political independence, and we still creep at horse-and-buggy pace toward the gaining of a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. I guess it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say ""wait."" But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick, brutalize, and even kill your black brothers and sisters with impunity; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she cannot go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her little eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see the depressing clouds of inferiority begin to form in her little mental sky, and see her begin to distort her little personality by unconsciously developing a bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son asking in agonizing pathos, ""Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?""; when you take a cross-country drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading ""white"" and ""colored""; when your first name becomes ""nigger"" and your middle name becomes ""boy"" (however old you are) and your last name becomes ""John,"" and when your wife and mother are never given the respected title ""Mrs.""; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never knowing what to expect next, and plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of ""nobodyness"" -- then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over and men are no longer willing to be plunged into an abyss of injustice where they experience the bleakness of corroding despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience. Letter From Birmingham Jail 3 YOU express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, it is rather strange and paradoxical to find us consciously breaking laws. One may well ask, ""How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?"" The answer is found in the fact that there are two types of laws: there are just laws, and there are unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that ""An unjust law is no law at all."" Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine when a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law, or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas, an unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. To use the words of Martin Buber, the great Jewish philosopher, segregation substitutes an ""I - it"" relationship for the ""I - thou"" relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. So segregation is not only politically, economically, and sociologically unsound, but it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Isn't segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, an expression of his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? So I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court because it is morally right, and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances because they are morally wrong. Let us turn to a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a majority inflicts on a minority that is not binding on itself. This is difference made legal. On the other hand, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow, and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal. Let me give another explanation. An unjust law is a code inflicted upon a minority which that minority had no part in enacting or creating because it did not have the unhampered right to vote. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up the segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout the state of Alabama all types of conniving methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties without a single Negro registered to vote, despite the fact that the Negroes constitute a majority of the population. Can any law set up in such a state be considered democratically structured? These are just a few examples of unjust and just laws. There are some instances when a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I was arrested Friday on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong with an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade, but when the ordinance is used to preserve segregation and to deny citizens the First Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and peaceful protest, then it becomes unjust. Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was seen sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar because a higher moral law was involved. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks before submitting to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. We can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was ""legal"" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was ""illegal."" It was ""illegal"" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's Germany. But I am sure that if I had lived in Germany during that time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers even though it was illegal. If I lived in a Communist country today where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I believe I would openly advocate disobeying these anti-religious laws. I MUST make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection. In your statement you asserted that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But can this assertion be logically made? Isn't this like condemning the robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical delvings precipitated the misguided popular mind to make him drink the hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because His unique God-consciousness and never-ceasing devotion to His will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see, as federal courts have consistently affirmed, that it is immoral to urge an individual to withdraw his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest precipitates violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. Letter From Birmingham Jail 4 I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth of time. I received a letter this morning from a white brother in Texas which said, ""All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but is it possible that you are in too great of a religious hurry? It has taken Christianity almost 2000 years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth."" All that is said here grows out of a tragic misconception of time. It is the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time is neutral. It can be used either destructively or constructively. I am coming to feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the vitriolic words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. We must come to see that human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of men willing to be coworkers with God, and without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. YOU spoke of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I started thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of complacency made up of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, have been so completely drained of self-respect and a sense of ""somebodyness"" that they have adjusted to segregation, and, on the other hand, of a few Negroes in the middle class who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and because at points they profit by segregation, have unconsciously become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred and comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up over the nation, the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad's Muslim movement. This movement is nourished by the contemporary frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination. It is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incurable devil. I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need not follow the do-nothingism of the complacent or the hatred and despair of the black nationalist. There is a more excellent way, of love and nonviolent protest. I'm grateful to God that, through the Negro church, the dimension of nonviolence entered our struggle. If this philosophy had not emerged, I am convinced that by now many streets of the South would be flowing with floods of blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as ""rabble-rousers"" and ""outside agitators"" those of us who are working through the channels of nonviolent direct action and refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes, out of frustration and despair, will seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies, a development that will lead inevitably to a frightening racial nightmare. Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The urge for freedom will eventually come. This is what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom; something without has reminded him that he can gain it. Consciously and unconsciously, he has been swept in by what the Germans call the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America, and the Caribbean, he is moving with a sense of cosmic urgency toward the promised land of racial justice. Recognizing this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand public demonstrations. The Negro has many pent-up resentments and latent frustrations. He has to get them out. So let him march sometime; let him have his prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; understand why he must have sitins and freedom rides. If his repressed emotions do not come out in these nonviolent ways, they will come out in ominous expressions of violence. This is not a threat; it is a fact of history. So I have not said to my people, ""Get rid of your discontent."" But I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled through the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. Now this approach is being dismissed as extremist. I must admit that I was initially disappointed in being so categorized. But as I continued to think about the matter, I gradually gained a bit of satisfaction from being considered an extremist. Was not Jesus an extremist in love? -- ""Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you."" Was not Amos an extremist for justice? -- ""Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream."" Was not Paul an extremist for the gospel of Jesus Christ? -- ""I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."" Was not Martin Luther an extremist? -- ""Here I stand; I can do no other so help me God."" Was not John Bunyan an extremist? -- ""I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a mockery of my conscience."" Was not Abraham Lincoln an extremist? -- ""This nation cannot survive half slave and half free."" Was not Thomas Jefferson an extremist? -- ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."" So the question is not whether we will be extremist, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate, or will we be extremists for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice, or will we be extremists for the cause of justice? I had hoped that the white moderate would see this. Maybe I was too optimistic. Maybe I expected too much. I guess I should have realized that few members of a race that has oppressed another race can understand or appreciate the deep groans and passionate yearnings of those that have been oppressed, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent, and determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still all too small in quantity, but they are big in quality. Some, like Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, and James Dabbs, have written about our struggle in eloquent, prophetic, and understanding terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They sat in with us at lunch counters and rode in with us on the freedom rides. They have languished in filthy roach-infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of angry policemen who see them as ""dirty nigger lovers."" They, unlike many of their moderate brothers, have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful ""action"" antidotes to combat the disease of segregation. Letter From Birmingham Jail 5 LET me rush on to mention my other disappointment. I have been disappointed with the white church and its leadership. Of course, there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand this past Sunday in welcoming Negroes to your Baptist Church worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Springhill College several years ago. But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do not say that as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church. I say it as a minister of the gospel who loves the church, who was nurtured in its bosom, who has been sustained by its Spiritual blessings, and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall lengthen. I had the strange feeling when I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery several years ago that we would have the support of the white church. I felt that the white ministers, priests, and rabbis of the South would be some of our strongest allies. Instead, some few have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained-glass windows. In spite of my shattered dreams of the past, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and with deep moral concern serve as the channel through which our just grievances could get to the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand. But again I have been disappointed. I have heard numerous religious leaders of the South call upon their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white ministers say, follow this decree because integration is morally right and the Negro is your brother. In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churches stand on the sidelines and merely mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard so many ministers say, ""Those are social issues which the gospel has nothing to do with,"" and I have watched so many churches commit themselves to a completely otherworldly religion which made a strange distinction between bodies and souls, the sacred and the secular. There was a time when the church was very powerful. It was during that period that the early Christians rejoiced when they were deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was the thermostat that transformed the mores of society. Wherever the early Christians entered a town the power structure got disturbed and immediately sought to convict them for being ""disturbers of the peace"" and ""outside agitators."" But they went on with the conviction that they were ""a colony of heaven"" and had to obey God rather than man. They were small in number but big in commitment. They were too God-intoxicated to be ""astronomically intimidated."" They brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contest. Things are different now. The contemporary church is so often a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. It is so often the arch supporter of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the church's often vocal sanction of things as they are. But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If the church of today does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its authentic ring, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. I meet young people every day whose disappointment with the church has risen to outright disgust. I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are presently misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with the destiny of America. Before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson scratched across the pages of history the majestic word of the Declaration of Independence, we were here. For more than two centuries our foreparents labored here without wages; they made cotton king; and they built the homes of their masters in the midst of brutal injustice and shameful humiliation -- and yet out of a bottomless vitality our people continue to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands. I must close now. But before closing I am impelled to mention one other point in your statement that troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping ""order"" and ""preventing violence."" I don't believe you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its angry violent dogs literally biting six unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I don't believe you would so quickly commend the policemen if you would observe their ugly and inhuman treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you would watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you would see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys, if you would observe them, as they did on two occasions, refusing to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I'm sorry that I can't join you in your praise for the police department. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Letter From Birmingham Jail 6 It is true that they have been rather disciplined in their public handling of the demonstrators. In this sense they have been publicly ""nonviolent."" But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation. Over the last few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. So I have tried to make it clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or even more, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends. I wish you had commended the Negro demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer, and their amazing discipline in the midst of the most inhuman provocation. One day the South will recognize its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, courageously and with a majestic sense of purpose facing jeering and hostile mobs and the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a seventy-two-year-old woman of Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride the segregated buses, and responded to one who inquired about her tiredness with ungrammatical profundity, ""My feets is tired, but my soul is rested."" They will be young high school and college students, young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders courageously and nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience's sake. One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters they were in reality standing up for the best in the American dream and the most sacred values in our Judeo-Christian heritage. Never before have I written a letter this long -- or should I say a book? I'm afraid that it is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else is there to do when you are alone for days in the dull monotony of a narrow jail cell other than write long letters, think strange thoughts, and pray long prayers? If I have said anything in this letter that is an understatement of the truth and is indicative of an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything in this letter that is an overstatement of the truth and is indicative of my having a patience that makes me patient with anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me.

1gvdfuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gvdfuc/should_i_reach_out/,Should I reach out?,"Me (19M) and my ex (17F) broke up a little over two months ago after nearly 1 year relationship. The reason is still a bit unclear to me, but just to give it some context.

We both felt the passion hadn‚Äôt been the same the past weeks, although we still cared deeply for each other. I suggested we took a 2 week break, she agreed. The following day she breaks up with me. Reason: ‚ÄúTwo weeks is not going to change how I feel‚Äù and also that she could not stop having troubling thought about the fact that I kissed another 3 weeks into our relationship (very stupid mistake I know but FYI I was very supportive towards her afterwards and clear that if she wanted to communicate about it I was always there for her because I loved her more than anything else). She also said she didn‚Äôt recognize the person I was now compared to the person I was when we met and fell for each other hard. This was mainly due to some mental troubles I have been having but I have been working on it and can genuinely say I am better now than 2 months ago and steadily improving for now.

This however sent me into a spiral. I always thought that this was just us exiting the honeymoon phase and now the real stuff begins. Falling in love is easy and can happen anybody, staying in love is an effort (IMO).
The following days we met at a party and spoke. She started crying hysterically because she felt so bad about it but insisted it was the right decision. I tried to tell her my thoughts and that I would be willing to try to make us work, but in the end I just left when she told me that I was too nice in the relationship. I needed to show some self-respect at least. And mind you I was not a people-pleaser towards her who did anything and everything. Yes I was very generous with my time and money but there were times we disagreed and I stood my ground even though she hates my guts for it.

The following week she sleeps with another guy, and for context she made us both swear that we would not touch another partner in the following 4 weeks out of respect for each other. I held my part of the deal, she didn‚Äôt.

Sorry for that essay. Now the question is in the title: Should I reach out to her in the upcoming months? I have been close to doing it a couple times by writing her letters and stuff but I never sent anything because I reminded myself that she broke her own promise and she told me I was too nice. And as the stubborn person I am I kind of think that I should not let myself submit to her, due to those reasons. She doesn‚Äôt deserve it. On the other hand she was my best friend, and part of me just thinks she was a bit immature and I do miss her (more as a friend but maybe something more as well I don‚Äôt really know) and her family, and I know the family misses me cause they have reached out since wanting to grab coffee.


What do you guys think? Thank you in advance!

edit: Just to give more context. When we broke up she still wanted to hang out and go on walks and spend time together as friends but I said never in my life and I have been very stubborn with having NC with her, if that makes any difference.",1,1732064873.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1gvdfcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlanning/comments/1gvdfcc/1_day_parkhopper_trip_report_holiday_opening_day/,1 Day Park-Hopper Trip Report (Holiday Opening Day!),"Hello! We just got back from a trip to Disneyland and wanted to share a trip report because of how helpful this sub was with our planning process.

Some basic info about us -- we are two adults with no kids and only had one day to visit the parks. We purchased lightning lane multi-pass and considered purchasing the premiere pass but were glad we didn't because we didn't need it. We are not really ""Disney"" people -- the last time we both visited was when we were kids (one Disneyland and one Disney World) so it's been a while and we learned everything about planning for our trip through this sub and watching Fresh Baked and SoCal Disney Dad on YouTube. We were prioritizing rides, but there were some other activities (the drawing class, turtle talk, visiting Grand Californian), that we wanted to do but weren't able to get in. Next time!

I was nervous it'd be a busy day in the park since we went on Nov 15, the holiday opening and Tiana's palace opening. We **did not do a true rope drop** because my partner had to do some early morning work calls, but we arrived at the park around 8:45am so we did benefit from lower crowds then. If you did do a real rope drop you'd probably get more in!

I'll summarize our key learnings here and put the longer trip report at the bottom of this post. Obviously without kids we could take fewer breaks and do more, but I hope some of it is helpful!

1. **Make a plan!** I am a bit of an anxious planner, but this was helpful because we were able to overplan and hit so many things. First, I watched a bunch of videos from Fresh Baked and SoCal Disney Dad about how to use LL Multi-Pass and how have a successful rope drop / park close. I then put together a big excel spreadsheet of all of the rides in Disneyland and DCA and ranked the ones we were interested. I also marked which had Single Rider lanes and which had LLs. This was very helpful because we were able to use Single Rider to our advantage a lot during LL wait times. I also made a list of all the food items we were interested in trying and which quick service stations they'd be at. We were able to get 20 rides done in one day, and I felt like we could have packed more in if we didn't spend as much time eating / hanging out. The better you know the LL system and where all the rides / food are (see no 3), the better prepared you'll be to move things / adjust schedules on the fly day of.
2. **Prioritize.** With just one day and two parks we KNEW there would be things we wanted to do that we wouldn't get to. In the ranked list of to-dos, I also flagged everything we HAD to try vs. just wanted to try. This also changed the day of. Originally we really wanted to do Tiana's, but it was freezing that day (and was frankly hard to get a spot in the VQ) so we axed that.
3. **Know the map!** Have a rough idea of where everything is in the park so you can avoid walking too much. This is pretty simple, but I really tried to optimize putting things together so we didn't have to walk to much. We still walked over 35k steps in one day but at least we minimized where we could. we did park hop more than probably necessary because I was trying (key word) to avoid getting stuck in huge crowds for the parades / fireworks, but I didn't do this well.
4. **Maximize Time, not Lightning Lanes.** This might(?) be controversial but we took a bunch of 2-hour hits (that I always set a timer for!) on our LLs and planned around that rather than trying to use as many LLs as possible. What I mean by this is -- we prioritized getting LLs for rides that we knew would have long standby waits. The first LL we booked was for Indy when we got in the park at 8:45am and as I booked it, it changed from an 11am return to a 1pm return. We took it because I thought it would only get longer (and I tried modifying but it didn't really change much) and just took the 2 hour hit by doing standby and single rider and paid for a ROTR LL. I wasn't trying to prioritize doing shorter return time LLs because many of those had more reasonable standby wait times or single rider. In fact, we ended up not using our Space Mountain LL at all because we did single rider and used those LL ""spots"" to hold harder to get attractions like Indy or Guardians. Plus, we didn't want lightning lane to dictate where we had to go in the park since we knew it'd be a long day, but rather stayed in certain areas to try to consolidate some of the walking required. Also, after \~5pm or so, most DCA lightning lanes were pretty much immediate so we were able to take advantage of that and run through a ton of rides quickly.
5. **Go with the flow!** My original schedule was so jam-packed that it probably would have been an unpleasant Disney experience. When we wanted to slow down, we took long breaks at food stops or just sat on a bench. Honestly it was better this way to just take in a lot of the Disney vibe. We also ended up going on a few rides that we weren't even going to because they had short lines and we didn't want to wait -- this ended up being great! We also took a bunch of photos with different characters and at photopass stops between rides.
6. **Food was ... good?!** We only did quick service but the food we tried was actually pretty good and reasonably priced (for what we'd expect). We split a bunch of items and had Red Rose Tavern breakfast (basic and solid), the cocoa puff iced coffee (really good), Adorable Snowman raspberry and mango soft serve (amazing), Plaza Inn fried chicken (solid, but wouldn't get again), and Tiana's Palace mac & cheese and chicken & sausage gumbo (this was SO good that my cajun partner said: ""this is way better than it needs to be for Disney"")
