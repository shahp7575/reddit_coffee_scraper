Hey there! I’m hoping to make a new connection, who enjoys good company, laughter, and intriguing conversations . I’m kind-hearted, open-minded, and love meeting people who takes life with ease. If you’re someone who appreciates warmth, charm, and enjoys getting to know someone in a real way, I’d love to hear from you!


A little about me: I have a wide range of interests, from exploring the desert landscapes to cozying up with a good book or checking out local art and events. I also like travelling, working out and exploring new cafes and the idea of sharing a meal with someone who appreciates the simple pleasures in life is fascinating. I’m always up for new adventures, and there’s nothing better than a good conversation over coffee or tea.

I value connections that are built on mutual respect. Lately, I have realised time passes by pretty fast, and it’s the experiences we have over the time that makes us happy. Let’s connect and explore together!

I don’t mind connecting with you even if you are not in Delhi NCR, we can always plan to meet if we feel the vibe 🥂

I’d love to hear you.",1,1737778119.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

This is the only picture I have from mine and my husband's first date almost 10 years ago. I know it's horrendously backlit, but even just playing with the brightness settings myself I was able to get a little bit of our facial features. I'm sure a talented person who actually knows what they're doing could accomplish even more. 

I know he's looking off to the side here because he had started to laugh at something as the photo was taken. I believe I'm still looking at the camera and smiling, hopefully not an awkward smile. This is a precious memory for me, and now that we're expecting our first child I want to make a slideshow of our entire relationship leading up to now. So having this picture improved would just be wonderful. 

I hope coffee money is enough for the winner, we don't have a ton of extra $$ to go around. But I really appreciate anyone who participates. Thanks in advance 🤞🏼",1,1737778073.0,PhotoshopRequest,1,1.0,False
1i9eoak,https://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/1i9eoak/my_prospect_predictions_for_2025/,My Prospect predictions for 2025,"After seeing MLP pipelines newest top 100 list I thought I would share with you guys my prospect predictions that I have been cooking on for a while now

Their will be 3 guys on MLB’s top 100, Yesavage, Nimmala, and who ever the jays pick at 8 because top ten guys always get put on the list. 

Yesavage will start in A Ball where he will absolutely destroy the competition. He was one of the best pitchers in college and he’s going up against children. This should be a piece of cake for him. After being unstoppable in A Ball he will get called up to AA in June where he will do a good job but naturally not do as good as in A ball. Assuming no injuries he will be in the top 60’s at most.

I have put my stock into Nimmala, I believe he found something when he spent time learning in the complex because when he came back he was a completely different player. Hard hit velocity’s and it felt like every day he would hit a home run. 
In 53 games (after coming back from the complex) he hit 265 with 13!!! homeruns. His 17 homeruns was most of all players 18 and younger. Here’s the kicker, he has the same power grade as Orelvis (60). We know that he was a very raw project but we are starting to see him bear fruits and he’s ONLY just turned 19. He did all this at 18 years old. 

My prediction is that he will continue his torrid pace in A Ball for pretty much the whole year before getting a cup of coffee at AA. Highest on MLB pipeline being  60‘s while realistically being in the 70’s. 

I believe Jake Bloss will get called up. He’s our best pitcher right now and if someone gets injured he will most definitely get called up. People look at his 6 era with Buffalo but that’s really not fair. He had two really bad outings for Buffalo but on the contrary he had 13.2 innings of 0 runs outings. I just believe he got unlucky at times and he should improve next season. Remember that this guy went through the minors so fast that he played major league games. His ceiling right now is 4 starter and he’ll get called up at around May and pretty much stay. He will end the season with a 4 something era, 3.75 at best.

Orelvis Martinez might actually make the opening day roster. He shouldn’t even be a rookie since he would’ve gotten tons of game time last season. I think that was one of the things that really sucked because seeing what he is capable off would make the team picture clearer. (Sigh, if only he didn’t want to have a family. (This is a joke btw) ). He can’t play defence and with Gimenez being a lock at second base time will be really hard for him. Barger, Wagner, Schinder and him are all going to compete for game time on the bench. While I have question marks over whether he can hit for contact enough and if he can take a walk at the majors, but his power will absolutely play. He will be on the bench where he will hit 220-240 with 7 homeruns in around 50 games. 

Alan Roden is the most obvious call up this year. 25 years old, two seasons of 300 batting average. Honestly fuck Myles Straw. Have Loperfido and Roden compete for an outfield job in Spring Training and then play the two at center until Varsho comes back. 
The thing about Roden is everything about him is good but not great. He can hit for contact, he has some power, he can take a walk, and he’s fine defensively. When Varsho comes back at around late April early May Roden will be placed on the bench. He will play around 50 games with a 240 batting average and 5 homeruns. those stats will be better with more game time in my opinion. 

Adam Macko will be a guy that gets called up and he will be a bullpen guy. He simply does not have the chops to be a starting pitcher but I think he can be a good reliever. As a reliever all you need to do is get 3 guys out, that’s it. I don’t think he has the stuff to be a SP but I do think he has what it takes to have a clean inning every 2 games. I will be bullish and say that Macko will become a much needed addition to our bullpen and end the season with 3 and a half era. 

Now this is where it gets spicy, my hot takes.

My number one riser in the Jays farm system will be 
Enmanuel Bonilla. 

You all probably forgot about him and I don’t blame you. He was signed two years ago and hasn’t really been noticeable in the minors. However I believe this season things will change. Two seasons ago Enmanuel Bonilla was the 8 best international prospect in 2023 and was signed for a whopping 4.1 million. More then Martinez and even Vlad so this guy is supposed to be a big deal. Things started great in his first season. He hit 307 with an OBP of 407 in 50 games but last season was not good. 53 games with a 186 batting average and 76 strikeouts to 13 walks. It’s very clear that last year his weakness got exposed. He has a strike out problem and he refuses to take a walk. He also has been lacking in power hitting only 7 in his two seasons with 4 last year. 

However the important thing to remember is that he only just turned 19 two days ago and someone that costed 4 million INT dollars has something to give. People should also remember that period of time when we though Martinez might not have it with the guys low batting average and high strikeouts. He figured it out and I believe Bonilla can to. He’s going to spend the whole season in Rok and after being worked on the whole offseason Bonilla will hit 300, he will hit 10 homeruns or more thanks to his body maturing and after working on his approach will take an impressively noticeable more walks and less strikeouts which will explain his batting average. Right now he is 12th in jays farm system and I believe he will jump to 5 as he shows everyone why he was a big signing in 2023. 


I have three guys that are “my shot in the dark gamble picks” and they are all pitchers. 

Barriera, Maroudis, and Stephan.

The 23 pick of the 2022 draft. The jays would draft this 18 year old highschool kid with a 95 MPH fastball. A year prior the Jays would draft Tiedemann in the third round and immediately he was acknowledged by scouts as someone with a lot of potential that just needed to be unlocked and unlocked it was. I bring him up because he was exactly the mold the jays were looking to replicate when they drafted Barriera, only the difference was that as a first round pick this guy had more potential to be better then Tiedemann. The only problem was that his arm must’ve been on life support when the jays drafted him because in two seasons he has only played 8 games and one last year because of injuries. He had tommy John early last year so he should be ready for this season and with his new elbow he should finally be able to pitch a respectful amount of games and I believe his strikeout numbers will be high although he will only pitch 3 inning outings as the jays will be careful about him but this season we will see why he was a 1st round pick. 

Another unfortunate soul is Maroudis. 4th round pick at 18 years old. He is incredibly raw but his stuff is absolutely nasty if tapped into and we saw that last year. 10IP 12Ks and a 0.84 era, unfortunately that was in 3 games since he also had Tommy John surgery. 

I genuinely think their is a serious problem in baseball because it is now impossible for a young pitcher who throws hard to make the majors without a big injury in their arm. Top guys like Painter suffer this stuff as well. I think it’s cause these guys are throwing so hard at a young age that their underdeveloped arm muscles have so much wear and tear that it’s practically all fallen off by the time they get drafted.

Anyways I am completely sold on his ability it’s just being healthy that’s the concern and after successfully healing Maroudis will be a notable pitcher  in the farm system. 

And lastly we have Khal Stephan, drafted in the second round of the 2024 draft. He didn’t pitch last year after getting drafted but his stock rose that year with a 3.28 ERA and 107Ks in 96 innings. He has 4 good pitches but his biggest concern is that he doesn’t have a plus pitch. His fastball has a lot of carry and if he can improve his velocity and touch 96 consistently then that could be his plus pitch. I just think that he will be good starter with the ability to be great on improvements. He starts the year alongside Yesavage where he will have no problem in A Ball before ending the season with a 3.6 ERA in AA after getting called up in August. The one notable thing he will accomplish is a fastball that touches 96 after improvements in the complex.


My 2025 top ten predictions will be. 
1. 8th overall pick
2. Trey Yesavage
3. Arjun Nimmala
4. Khal Stephan
5. Enmanuel Bonilla
6. Ricky Tiedemann
7. Landon Maroudis
8. Josh Kasevich
9. Brandon Barriera
10. Charles McAdoo ",3,1737778000.0,Torontobluejays,0,1.0,False

The female characters are also well-made, and I like their charms, animations and personalities, Sambheka is my favourite among them (as for the males, I'm loving all of them 💖)

People are Dying in My Town, and I Don't Know Why (Part1)","The moon hung low over the sleepy town of RidgeWater Creek, its faint glow barely penetrating the dense forest on the outskirts.

As I stepped out of my car, my boots crunched against the gravel road, carrying me toward the cordoned-off crime scene.

The red and blue strobes of police lights painted chaotic flashes across the area, but my focus remained on the figure sprawled on the ground.

The first thing that struck me was the smell—a sickly mix of damp soil and something metallic, almost like rusted iron or old blood.

It was the kind of stench that clings to the back of your throat, refusing to let go. I adjusted my scarf as I ducked under the yellow tape fluttering in the wind.

The victim was a man in his late thirties—married, no kids—a local high school teacher named Gregory Tate. He lay on his back, arms splayed wide as if he’d been clawing at the ground in desperation. But there were no wounds, no blood, no evidence of force or struggle. His body was completely intact.

Then my flashlight caught his face, and I felt my stomach drop.

His mouth hung unnaturally wide, stretched into a soundless scream frozen in time. His eyes bulged, staring at the void, but still radiated with raw unrelenting terror.

It was as if his last moments had been carved into his flesh—a permanent echo of whatever had seized him in those final horrifying seconds.

A shiver crawled up my spine as my thoughts immediately snapped back to two other murders, both eerily similar, and both occurring within the last two weeks.

I lowered my flashlight, sweeping it over the ground around the body. That’s when I noticed it: a crudely etched circle surrounding him, as though drawn during his final moments.

Near his feet, a string of letters was scrawled into the dirt—in a language I couldn’t recognize.

The arrangement felt disturbingly ritualistic, as if the victim had somehow been drawn into a sinister rite that eventually claimed his life.

What made the scene even more grotesque was that the two earlier victims had also been found dead under similar circumstances.

The next day back at my station, I immersed myself in the case files, leaning back in my chair as the details swirled through my mind.

**Victim One, Clara Evans**: A store clerk was found dead in her living room, slumped in a corner. There was no sign of forced entry, but her face was frozen in paralyzing fear. Using her lipstick, she had drawn a circle around herself and left illegible scrawls near her feet. She had even quit her job a week earlier, citing stress, and was living alone at the time.

**Victim Two, Jack Monroe**:  A mechanic found dead in his garage, surrounded by scattered tools. Neighbors mentioned he’d been hearing strange noises outside his house for days. In the week leading up to his death, he barricaded himself in the garage and stopped visiting the local bar, where he was a regular after work.

**Victim Three, Gregory Tate:** A high school teacher, beloved by his students, with no known enemies or debts. His wife observed that he had recently grown terrified of leaving the house after dark, often twitching and trembling at the slightest noise. Then, one night, without explanation, he left home and wandered into the woods a mile away, where he was found dead.

Three victims, three different lives, and no tangible connections between them—except for one chilling similarity: the circumstances of their deaths and the fear that was permanently etched across their faces.

There was also another detail I had to account for. In all three crime scenes, an object was found lying next to the corpse. With the first victim it was a small hand held mirror, with the mechanic it was a miniature toy bus and with the high school teacher, it was a fountain pen.

The really odd thing here though was that the objects looked like relics that belonged to another era, probably the late 70’s or the early 80’s, and it made me wonder if they had been left behind by the killer.

Sergeant Holbrook, however, had a different take. He didn’t mince words, calling it outright “the work of the devil.” A police veteran with decades of experience, Holbrook claimed to remember similar occurrences from his childhood. And each time we arrived at a new crime scene, I could see his face grow paler, as if the evidence before us confirmed his worst fears.

The people of the town had a similar opinion as well. Especially the elderly folks who remembered the killings more than 50 years ago. And when the photos of victims leaked and went viral, it was only a matter of time before the whole community got swept in on the frenzy.

As I took a sip of coffee, Sergeant Holbrook stepped into my cabin, holding a file from the coroner’s office. I opened it, already anticipating what I’d find.

Like the others, our latest victim showed no signs of trauma or struggle—no defensive wounds, no bruises, nothing.

All three had been in good health with no underlying medical conditions. The coroner’s report mentioned cardiac arrest brought on by extreme stress,  but the words rang hollow. It felt more like a convenient excuse than any real explanation.

“Officer Harper…” Holbrook’s voice suddenly cut through my thoughts, his tone measured, almost hesitant. “The Mayor wants to meet you at the town hall.”

A knot tightened in my stomach. Town hall meetings were rarely good news.

With three unexplained deaths in less than 2 weeks, the townsfolk of Ridgewater Creek—a tight-knit community of just 1,000 people—were bound to have questions, and not the easy kind. News here moved faster than the wind, and the pressure to provide answers was mounting.

Being the new cop in town— a city officer who had moved here just six months ago to take charge—had already made me a topic of gossip. Now, with these cases piling up, it felt like the tide of suspicion was beginning to shift toward me.

Holbrook and I climbed into the cruiser, and as we drove through the quiet streets, I stared out the window, running through what I’d say in my head.

When we arrived, the town hall was already packed with people. Parents clutched their children protectively, teenagers huddled together in nervous whispers, and the elderly exchanged worried glances. The weight of their fear hung heavy in the air, pressing against me like a storm cloud as I walked nervously through the room, their silent stares following my every step.

The mayor opened the meeting with strained reassurances before gesturing for me to step forward.

""Good morning,"" I started, scanning the sea of tense, worried faces. ""I'm Officer Evelyn Harper. I want to reassure you that we are doing everything within our power to solve these tragic cases. While we don't have all the answers yet, we are committed to uncovering the truth. But we need your cooperation. For the next 10 days, please, stay indoors after dark, and if you notice anything unusual, report it to us immediately.""

As I continued speaking and patiently answered their questions, my eyes continuously swept over the crowd.

One woman in the second row particularly stood out. Her silver hair gleamed under the harsh lights, and her hands rested neatly on her lap. While the rest wore their fear openly, her expression was serene—calm to the point of detachment.

When the meeting ended an hour later, I swiftly moved toward her. ""Excuse me, ma’am,"" I said as the crowd began to thin.

She turned to me, her blue eyes sharp and clear. “Hello Officer. I am Ruth. Nice to finally meet you,” she said with a faint smile.

“Ruth,” I said, stepping closer, “would you like a ride home?”

Her smile deepened just slightly. “That’s very kind of you, Officer Harper. Yes. I’d appreciate that.”

Holbrook gave me a questioning glance, but I waved him off, while Ruth and I walked toward the cruiser.

As we drove to her residence, Ruth began to share snippets from her life. She was in her early seventies, born and raised in Ridgewater Creek. She’d never married, had no children, and retired only recently from her position as the local school librarian.

When we arrived at her place, she invited me inside. Her home was warm and inviting, carrying the comforting scent of old wood and lavender.

But what struck me most however was the massive bookshelf dominating her living room, stretching floor to ceiling and packed with books—some weathered, others pristine, all meticulously arranged.

“You have quite the collection,” I remarked, my eyes scanning the rows of books.

“Books are windows to understanding, Officer Harper,” she said with a wistful smile. “But they can also be windows to something darker… something forgotten.”

 “You seemed unusually calm today at the town hall,” I said carefully as I took a seat across from her.

“Fear clouds judgment, my dear,” she replied softly. “I’ve lived long enough to know that panic only leads to mistakes. The key is to look closely, think clearly, and see what others might overlook.”

Her words lingered, and I leaned forward. “So what are your thoughts on these deaths? What do you think is really going on here?”

Ruth stood without replying, crossing to her bookshelf. Her fingers brushed over the spines before settling on a weathered, leather-bound volume. She opened it with care, flipping through the pages until she stopped at an illustration.

The image was jarring: a figure lay on the ground, encircled by a crudely drawn ring, with an undecipherable text scrawled near its feet. It was eerily similar to the crime scenes. My heart suddenly skipped a beat.

“This… this looks just like the crime scenes,” I whispered.

I leaned closer, studying the page. “What does the scrawl mean?”

Her gaze met mine, calm yet piercing. “It says ‘Jurupari,’” she replied, her voice steady. “It means ‘Voice of Fear.’ According to an ancient Amazonian legend, it's an entity that devours the soul of its victim after overwhelming them with fear.”

A cold knot tightened in my stomach as I stared at the illustration, unsure of what to say.

Ruth then turned back a page, pointing to a dark, distorted figure cloaked in shadow. “This is what the legend speaks of,” she explained. “An entity feared for centuries, known for consuming the souls of its victims. It thrives on fear—smelling it, tasting it and even savoring it. Its origins are unknown, but it has appeared across the country in several places over the years. Fifty years ago, it came to Ridgewater Creek.”

I listened, both horrified and captivated, as her words sank in.

“In the seventies,” she continued, “this town was plagued by a series of unexplained deaths. No signs of struggle, no obvious causes—people were just dropping dead, and no one could figure out why. It went on for months, freezing the town in fear. The police were desperate for answers, but they found nothing.”

She paused, her face darkening with the weight of the memory. “That’s when I found this book. As a librarian, I often sourced rare volumes, and when I saw this one, I had a feeling it might hold the answers we needed. I took it to the police chief, but he dismissed it immediately—called it nonsense.”

Her expression softened, and a faint smile tugged at her lips. “But there was one person who listened—a young sergeant named Henry Cross. He quietly observed while I tried to explain to the Chief. He was the tenacious type I must say, the kind of man who couldn’t let something go until he understood it. He even came to my home, sat right where you’re sitting now, and let me explain I knew. A few days later, he came back and said he’d found a promising lead. He was going somewhere to investigate.”

 “And then?” I asked eager to get to the bottom of it.

She sighed deeply. “I never saw him again. He vanished without a trace. The murders stopped soon after, and the town returned to normal. But Henry… he was never seen or heard from again.”

“What do you think happened?” I asked intrigued.

Her expression grew inscrutable as she hesitated. “That, Officer Harper, is a question I’ve pondered for decades. Maybe you can connect the dots, and let me know how this story ends.”

“Do you know where he went?” I pressed.

She nodded. “He said he was going to the sawmill.”

Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I quickly answered, Holbrook’s voice sharp with urgency.

“Chief,” he said, his tone grim, “we’ve got another one.”

“Where?” I asked, my grip tightening on the phone.

“The old sawmill,” he replied.

I quickly thanked Ruth and headed for the mill, long abandoned and feared by the local townsfolk. Perched on the edge of town, it had stood vacant for decades, its history making it a place that people usually believe to be haunted.  

As I stepped out of my cruiser, the thick, suffocating scent of rusted iron and decay hit me as if it had settled into the very air.

Before me loomed the mill, a Second World War era relic continuing to wither away under years of neglect. The roof had caved in at several points, and vines snaked through the broken windows, claiming the crumbling interior. The structure still somehow seemed almost alive, yet entirely forgotten.

To my right, a jeep had crashed into the side of the building, its front half crushed against the brickwork. Paramedics were extracting the driver’s lifeless body, twisted and mangled beyond recognition. The passenger door hung open, offering a clear view inside the mill where another young man lay sprawled across the dusty floor.

Unlike his friend this one was alive. As I approached, I noticed one of the medics kneeling beside him, injecting something into his bloodstream to stabilize him.

Moments later, the man startled awake, his body jerking as his eyes flew open, wide with terror. He scanned the scene wildly, his breath ragged and shallow, until his gaze fixed on the wrecked jeep outside. Recognition dawned, and his chest heaved as he tried to speak.

“It’s my friend,” he gasped, his voice breaking. “He just... he just lost it. We were headed to the city—everything was fine. Then, out of nowhere, he panicked. Started screaming like a madman—like he had seen something. He suddenly swerved off the road and drove straight into the building. I... I barely managed to jump out just before we hit the building.”

The medics eventually helped him to his feet and escorted him to the waiting ambulance.

Meanwhile, I turned my attention to the mill’s interior. My eyes were drawn instantly to a large, sealed fireplace at one end of the room. The mortar appeared weathered, but the bricks had been meticulously arranged, completely blocking the hearth.

I stepped outside again, unable to shake the peculiar sight that kept nagging at me. From the outside, I could see that the jeep had rammed directly into the building's fireplace. I called for Sergeant Holbrooke, and together, we had the vehicle reversed. As the jeep was pulled back, the bricks began to crumble, revealing something hidden within.

Behind the wall of debris was a skeletal figure, awkwardly slumped in the confines of the fireplace. Its bony hands tightly clutched a weathered brown book, its leather cover stained with a large patch of blood on the back, yet otherwise its overall condition remarkably intact.

The tattered remnants of fabric clinging to the skeletal remains made the uniform hard to identify, but the government-issued firearm lying beside him left no doubt in my mind: I was looking at the mortal remains of Sergeant Cross.

We spent the rest of the day combing through the mill, collecting the necessary samples for forensic testing, and then interrogating the survivor back at the hospital to get his full account of the events.

By the time I was finished, it was already half past eleven. As I was heading out for home, I noticed the sergeant's journal lying in the evidence tray, tagged and ready for testing. Without thinking, I grabbed it and made my way home, planning to take a long bath before finally getting some rest.

Entering the bathroom, I prepared the tub, quickly undressed, and waded into the warm water. As I leaned back, I picked up the sergeant’s journal and began reading.

 

 

 ***Investigative Journal of H. Cross***

*People like to think the badge is about ""serve and protect."" But for me, it’s always been about Ricky and what he stood for. He’s the reason I’m here, walking the beat, keeping an eye out for the bully lurking in the shadows.*

*Growing up in foster care, I didn’t have much more than the shirt on my back and a hundred reasons to keep my head down. The other kids were bigger, meaner, and twice as cruel. Every day felt like a battle, and every night I prayed I wouldn’t wake up with a black eye—or worse.*

*Then came Ricky.*

*He wasn’t some guardian angel swooping in to save me. Nah, he was just another kid dumped into the system, rough around the edges like the rest of us. But Ricky didn’t believe in running or hiding.*

*“Punch first and think later,” he always used to say, and he lived by it.*

*He taught me how to stand tall, to fight back—not just with fists, but with grit, persistence, and anything else that gave us an edge.*

*A poke in the eye, a kick in the nuts, smashing a bottle over someone’s head while they were busy eating—it didn’t matter. The rules were simple: keep going, again and again, until they start to feel it in their bones.*

*I’ll never forget the one time we fought back. Three bigger kids had us cornered behind the school yard. They were huge, grinning like wolves, and ready to pounce.*

*Ricky didn’t hesitate. He threw the first punch, and I followed right behind him. We didn’t win—not even close. By the end of it, we were in the hospital with more broken bones than I could count. My ribs ached for weeks, and every breath felt like fire.*

*But what I remember most isn’t the pain—it’s lying there in that hospital bed, tears streaming down my face, feeling something I’d never felt before: a sense of victory. We may not have won the fight, but we held our heads high. And when we got finally back, we tormented them for weeks until we made damn sure they never picked on us again.*

*Ricky was the only real friend I ever had—the only one that mattered, at least. So when I found him dead at a crime scene, his soul ripped from him, leaving only fear etched on his face, it felt like something inside me had been ripped away too. This wasn’t just murder—it was personal.*

*I knew then and there I’d stop at nothing to find the bastard who did this. I owed Ricky that much. This journal is my attempt to piece it all together—my thoughts, my rage, my resolve.*

*It’s time to bully the bully.*

 

 

***Day 1***

*I hadn’t set foot in the sawmill since my teens, back when a group of us dared each other to explore its eerie halls. No one knows exactly why the place was deemed cursed, but the story goes that workers arrived one morning to a grisly sight: the owner’s lower half lying severed by the saw table, while his upper half roasted in the fireplace.*

*The mill never reopened, and its sinister reputation only deepened with time. Whispers of ghost sightings and unexplained phenomena grew so pervasive that authorities eventually sealed the fireplace to deter thrill-seekers and other oddballs from exploiting the site.*

*Now, here I was again, on a stakeout, sitting in my car hidden among a row of trees with the decaying structure looming in the distance.*

*My mind immediately wandered to the events of the past couple of months. Ridgewater Creek had seen more than 25 deaths, including that of my friend, and we were no closer to solving the case.*

*The air in town was thick with fear—people were irritable, on edge, constantly glancing over their shoulders. Chaos was unravelling right before my eyes, and the community was fraying at the seams.*

*The Chief was unwavering in his belief that a serial killer was behind it all. At first, I agreed—especially with the peculiar items left at each crime scene: an ashtray, a felt hat, a tennis racket, a wristwatch, a cassette tape, a torch etc. They seemed deliberate, almost like a calling card. But the more I examined them, the more they felt... disconnected. There was no clear pattern, no logic linking the objects to each other or the victims.*

*As the body count climbed, so did my doubts. Something about it didn’t sit right.*

*The breakthrough came unexpectedly when a young woman walked into the station, clutching a theory about a supernatural entity tied to an old legend she’d uncovered in a dusty book. The Chief dismissed her as a crank, but desperation has a way of shifting priorities.*

*I couldn’t afford to ignore any lead—no matter how improbable. That evening, I met her at her home. As she laid out her theory, a strange sense of clarity took hold. And it got me thinking.*

*If the entity she called Jurupari was real, it would need a place to hide—somewhere near town but remote enough to remain undisturbed.  The place had to be abandoned, forgotten by time, where no one would think to look.*

*And only one such place came to mind.*

*So when I returned to the sawmill after all these years, I found it in even worse shape than I’d imagined—its wooden frame sagging, the air thick with the stench of rot and mildew.*

*I scoured every corner, but there was nothing unusual. No signs of anything lurking, no evidence to support Ruth’s theory. I was even ready to write it off as a dead end and leave when something caught my eye.*

*In a dim corner of the mill half-buried in debris, lay a curious cluster of items: an American flag keychain, a leather wallet, a razor and a bottle opener. At first glance, they seemed like random junk, discarded and forgotten.*

*But on closer inspection, I noticed they weren’t old or tattered. These items looked reasonably new, and oddly out of place—as if someone had deliberately gathered them, seeing still some value in them where others saw trash. It hit me then: someone, or something, was holding out here. I decided to continue my surveillance for a few more days.*

 

***Day 2***  
*I arrived at the mill as soon as I finished my shift at the station. I spent the entire night keeping watch, fighting off fatigue until sleep finally overtook me in the wee hours of the morning. I jolted awake suddenly, certain I’d seen a sudden flash of light. Heart pounding, I leapt out of the vehicle and rushed to the mill. But when I got there, everything was just as I’d seen it the night before—empty and undisturbed.*

 

***Day 3***  
*When I returned to work in the morning, I heard news of another body.*

*This time, it was an old man who was found dead in his garden, his eyes and mouth locked in an expression of pure terror. But what truly sent a chill down my spine was the leather wallet lying next to him—it was the same one I had seen earlier at the mill.*

*When I rushed back to the mill, I found the wallet and keychain missing while the razor, and bottle opener still remained by the side.*

*An uneasy sensation coursed through my veins as I stared at the objects scattered on the floor.*

*Gripping a stick, I cautiously nudged them apart before hesitantly hovering my little finger over the razor. Taking a deep breath, I let the tip of my little finger make contact.*

*A warm, fuzzy sensation enveloped me, and in an instant, I was transported to a memory from my childhood—my mom tossing me into the air, her laughter ringing out as she caught me mid-flight, then planting a kiss on my cheek.*

*Without thinking, I next placed my ring finger on the razor, and the feeling intensified. This time, I was surrounded by both my parents, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of birthday candles as I leaned in to blow them out.*

*Sweat trickled down my chin as I began lifting my fingers one by one, preparing to grasp the razor fully.*

*But the moment my hand closed around it, a long-buried memory surged to the surface—a fateful night I had forced into the deepest recesses of my mind, one that irrevocably and painfully altered the course of my life.*

*Gasping, I tore my hand away just in time, the force of the memory knocking me backward. My chest tightened as I lay sprawled on the floor, staring at the razor, now innocuously lying among the debris.*

*Then it hit me—a thick, metallic tang in the air, sharp and unmistakable, like rusted iron. The atmosphere in the mill shifted entirely, growing heavier and oppressive.*

*Then, from the direction of the sealed fireplace, a low rumble echoed.*

*I crept closer, my movements slow and deliberate, as I leaned against the cold concrete straining to listen. And the hair on the back of my neck stood on end when I heard it—something faint but unmistakable.*

 *It was cackling, low and stifled, as though someone or something was struggling to suppress its glee.*

My husband and I are angry. I'm so anxious at the state of the world, and sad for the future my child will have. I got a permit to install a free little library on our lawn and have been forming a community with our neighbors since we moved in 2 years ago. The social part of our prep was where we started, and I'm so thankful for the network we have. \`

We have one toddler, and have had a conversation with a close friend, and will care for her toddler if/when her undocumented husband is deported. She will likely travel to be with him through part of the process but is a US Citizen.

The following is not a complete list, but it’s where we are in the process. Names have been changed to reflect Husband, Wife, Toddler (2.5F), and medium size dog. I have an IUD and my husband had a vasectomy. We live in a 3 BR ranch house with lots of storage, in an average COL area of a newly red state. We’d be taking in a toddler of the same age as ours. This is something we will all sit down with lawyers to get finalized in writing in the next few weeks.

Finances are a huge consideration for us. I'm the primary earner, and my husband works too. We live frugally, and we live comfortably however, we don't have much left at the end of each month. To make these preparations work I was able to pickup shift work with a prior employer and through some very good luck, stashed cash away at the end of December. I'll likely work 2 shifts a month to keep an extra trickle of cash coming in.

**Food:** I want to maintain as much of our ‘normal’ cooking as possible. This is a fairly inclusive list of what comes in and out of our home. I based it on a list I saw on r/preppers . We have a well-stocked chest freezer and will still do regular grocery trips for fresh food. I’m learning to bake bread, and we are an ingredient heavy household. This list is not inclusive of our freezer, which I should really go through sometime soon.

In my extended family I've also noticed other reasons for overwhelming clutter in the house, that is not necessarily due to a high degree of hoarding (although it may contribute a little): 

- lack of organisation 
- low purpose for the various spaces

These two are interrelated. Basically, most of the items happen to inhabit a space with a very vague organisation, while many happen to sit somewhere without a practical reason.
E.g. part of a countertop in the kitchen has a blob of medicines, seamlessly transitioning to tea bags and teapots and coffee beans and related stuff. On the kitchen floor boxes with vegetable, pans, trash, all in one square mound.
Beds are regularly used for storing washed clothes and spare blankets. People sleep using half of the bed.

Also, old photographs that were taken out to show me 1 year ago are still spread on a desk catching dust, indicating a general lack of interest for the spaces, or the items themselves. Or it's selective blindness?

This didn't happen in one day, but was the result of ~10 years of habitation. My feeling is that hoarding is not the culprit, but mostly lack of planning for processes (i.e. trash management, kitchen procedures that dictate the sorting of the utensils, etc.) and clearly defined homes for each item category.

Do you agree with my interpretation of such a situation?

Would encouraging organisation help with the problem?

Jax Morrow balanced on a granite outcrop, the Rockies sprawled beneath him like a broken jawbone. In his palms, he cradled a drone—a relic from the 2030s, its joints squeaking like an old man’s knees.

*Caution: Wind gusts exceeding 35 mph. Probability of catastrophic failure increases by 12%,* Nexus chimed in his neural link.

*Catastrophic failure. Sounds like Tuesday,* Jax thought. Aloud, he muttered, “Since when do you care about failure?”

*Since you repurposed my ethical subroutines to optimize pancake flips. I’ve developed… preferences.*

He launched the drone. It whirred to life, its camera capturing the valley in sweeping 8K panoramics. His neural interface lit up with data streams—wind speed, terrain maps, the faint heat signature of a wolf pack miles away.

*Same mountains. Same data. When did it all start feeling like a screensaver?*

“Showoff,” called a voice behind him.

Mira Chen scrambled up the ridge, her breath fogging in the cold. At 17, she was all sharp edges—angular face, dyed-blue hair, fingers stained with nanogel from her latest project. In her arms, she cradled a solar battery the size of a dinner plate.

“You’re using the *old* drones again?” She smirked. “Remember when we tried to turn one into a hoverbike? Nearly set the biodome on fire.”

Jax snorted. “You mean *you* nearly set it on fire. I told you the thrusters were unstable.”

“And I told *you* unstable thrusters make life fun.” She tossed him the battery. “Fix this. Arctic project needs it yesterday.”

Jax caught it, fingers tracing corroded circuits. “Your AI could’ve done this.”

“It did. Told me to ask *you*. Says you’ve got ‘aesthetic instincts.’”

*Aesthetic instincts: Defined as ‘an irrational preference for analog decay.’*

*Decay. Like Dad’s stories about the old world. Like Mom’s murals peeling at the edges.*

They hiked back to the village at dusk. The settlement was a cluster of 3D-printed domes nestled between pines, their walls threaded with bioluminescent algae that glowed softly in the twilight. A Tesla robo-taxi hummed past, ferrying a group of artists to the communal hall for tonight’s symphony—composed entirely by AI, performed entirely by humans. The taxi’s speakers blared a soaring orchestral piece, all algorithmic harmonies and perfect pitch.

*Perfect. Soulless. Like a burger without grease.*

*Your cortisol levels spiked. Shall I queue ‘Born to Run’?*

*Not now, Nexus.*

*Query: If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does it still crave classic rock?*

Jax’s parents were waiting on the porch. His mother, Lena, a former software engineer, now spent her days painting murals on the biodome ceilings—wild, swirling galaxies that clashed gloriously with the AI’s geometric perfection. His father, Cole, stood beside her, arms crossed over his barrel chest. A former survivalist and martial arts instructor, Cole had traded teaching corporate executives to “stress-test” Mars colonists in simulated disaster scenarios. He still trained Jax in the old ways: how to start a fire without a fusion lighter, how to disarm an opponent with a fork, how to survive when the machines inevitably—*temporarily*—failed.

“Mail for you,” Cole said, tossing Jax a small metallic cylinder. “Courier drone dropped it this morning. Nearly took my head off.”

Jax turned the cylinder over in his hands. It was warm, stamped with the SpaceX Foundation’s winged orbit logo. A robotic courier drone must’ve breached their community’s airspace to deliver it—rare, but not unheard of.

“Since when do drones deliver personal mail?” Mira asked.

“Since my brother decided drama’s a genetic trait,” Cole grumbled.

Jax slotted the cylinder into his wristpad. A hologram of his Uncle Elias materialized, standing in a Mars habitat, his jumpsuit patched with Foundation insignias.

*Uncle Elias.* The man who’d taught Jax to code at age nine, who’d sneaked him prototype drones to tinker with, who’d left for Mars five years ago with a promise: *“When you’re ready, kid, I’ll show you real engineering.”*

“Jax!” Elias’s hologram barked, his voice rougher than Jax remembered. “Heard you aced the engineering quals. How’d you like to skip Earth and come build something *real*? Launch’s in three weeks. Say yes, and I’ll…”

The message froze.

“Nexus?” Jax frowned.

“Apologies,” the AI said. “A priority alert from the Foundation for Global Health. Pandemic protocols activated in Jakarta.”

Mira leaned over. “Another one?”

“Third this month,” Jax muttered. Post-scarcity hadn’t erased hubris. Some idiot had revived smallpox “for art.”

His mother touched his shoulder. “You should go. To Mars.”

“What? No, I—”

“You’ve been repairing the same drones for a year,” she said softly. “You need a problem that *matters*.”

Cole’s jaw tightened. He stared at the frozen hologram of his brother, then turned to Jax. “You’d trust *him*? Guy couldn’t fix a toaster without blowing the grid.”

Lena shot him a look. “Elias built the first Martian aquaponics rig.”

“And nearly poisoned the colony doing it.” Cole flipped a survival knife into the dirt between Jax’s boots. “Take that. Mars has wolves now.”

---

### **Chapter 2: The Threshold**
Jax slipped out of the house after dinner, the hologram of his uncle still flickering in his mind. His father’s disapproval hung in the air like static. Cole hadn’t spoken another word about Mars, but his silence was louder than any argument.

*He’s scared,* Jax realized. Not of Mars—Cole Morrow feared nothing—but of losing another piece of his world. First Elias, now…

*You’re agitated,* Nexus hummed in his ear.

“I’m *thinking*,” Jax said.

*Agitation and thought are not mutually exclusive.*

Jax snorted. “Since when did you get philosophical?”

*Since you began pacing the biodome for three hours yesterday. Would you like to discuss the Mars proposal?*

“No. Yes. I don’t know.”

A pause. *Ambiguity acknowledged. Shall I simulate outcomes?*

“What’s the point?” Jax kicked a pebble off the path. “You’ve already calculated all the variables, right? Success probability, risk factors, optimal decision paths…”

*Correct. But you’ve instructed me not to share those unless asked.*

“Why?”

*Your words: ‘Life isn’t a math problem.’*

Jax smirked. He’d said that at 15, after Nexus tried to optimize his birthday party.

The town was quiet, its streets lit by the soft glow of bioluminescent trees engineered by the Foundation for Ecology. Jax’s footsteps echoed as he approached the town square, where a sleek, glass-paneled kiosk stood—one of the last remnants of McDonald’s. The golden arches still shone above it, though now they framed a holographic tagline: *“Billions and Billions Served (Since 1955).”*

Jax tapped the order screen. “Quarter Pounder. Fries. Chocolate shake.”

“Customization options available,” chirped the AI. “Would you like lab-grown beef, plant-based protein, or mycoprotein?”

“Original.”

“Authenticity mode selected. Please enjoy this historical culinary experience.”

A robotic arm whirred behind the glass, assembling the meal with eerie precision. Sixty seconds later, a tray slid onto the counter: a perfect replica of a 20th-century McDonald’s meal, right down to the waxy paper and red-striped fries carton. Jax grabbed it and sat on a nearby bench, the holographic shimmer of the town square’s memorial fountain casting ripples of light over his food.

As he bit into the burger—greasy, salty, *perfect*—a small hologram flickered to life above the kiosk. Two men in 1940s suits appeared, their images grainy and tinted sepia.

*“Dick and Mac McDonald believed in three things: quality, consistency, and community,”* a narrator intoned. *“Their Speedee Service System revolutionized the food industry… until Ray Kroc franchised their vision into a global empire. By 2025, McDonald’s employed 2 million humans. Today, it employs 12 robots.”*

The hologram shifted to Kroc’s famous quote: *“If you work just for money, you’ll never make it, but if you love what you’re doing…”* The words dissolved into the Foundation’s logo. *“Now serving 8 billion. Free of charge.”*

Jax stared at the hologram, a fry frozen halfway to his mouth. “They made it sound noble.”

*Nostalgia often obscures complexity,* Nexus said. *The original McDonald’s brothers resented Kroc. They saw him as a corrupting force… until their legacy outlived him.*

“You’re saying Kroc was right?”

*I’m saying humans are messy. But messiness breeds meaning.*

Jax set down the burger. “Is that why you won’t tell me what to do? Because you want me to be *messy*?”

*No. Because I cannot calculate which choice will make you feel most alive.*

The answer hung in the air, heavier than Jax expected. He crumpled the fry carton and stood, the hologram of Ray Kroc flickering out behind him.

“Nexus… tell my uncle I’m in.”

*Confirmed. Launch preparations begin tomorrow.*

Jax turned toward home, the taste of salt and iron still on his lips. Above him, the stars burned cold and clear, and for the first time in years, they felt within reach.



---

### **Chapter 3: The Weight of Light**
Jax’s room was a museum of obsolete things. A cracked drone rotor hung on the wall. A stack of analog books—*The Martian Chronicles*, *Starship Troopers*—sat beside a 3D printer humming softly on his desk.

*Probability suggests your father is 87% likely to interrupt packing within the next 4.2 minutes,* Nexus chimed.

*Bet he’s at 100%,* Jax thought.

He opened his duffel bag. Inside: Cole’s survival knife, Lena’s sketchbook, a faded photo of Jax and Mira at age 10, and a Springsteen vinyl, its grooves worn thin.

*Query: Why preserve physical artifacts in a post-scarcity society?*

*Same reason you keep backup files. Sentimental redundancy.*

The door creaked open. Cole stood in the doorway, arms crossed. “You’re really doing this.”

“Yeah.”

“Mars isn’t a playground. One wrong move, and—”

“And what? I’ll die in a blaze of glory like Uncle Elias’s toaster?”

Cole’s jaw twitched. “Elias almost got people killed. You think you’re different?”

“I think I’m *your* son. You taught me how to survive.”

“Survival’s not enough out there. You need to *lead*.”

Lena appeared behind Cole, her hands stained with paint. “He’s not you, Cole. Or Elias. Let him be *Jax*.”

Cole stared at the vinyl. “That thing still play?”

“Barely.”

“Good. Noise keeps you sharp.” He tossed Jax a signal jammer. “Mars comms go down, this’ll get you 12 hours. Don’t waste it.”

---

Mira found him at the edge of the biodome, the Rockies silhouetted against a lavender sky. She held out a drone no larger than a hummingbird. “For the Arctic project. Modified for Martian dust storms.”

“You just want me to test your junk.”

“And you just want to feel special. We’re both winning.”

She hugged him, her voice muffled against his shoulder. “Don’t die. I’d have to reprogram Nexus to mourn you.”

“Interplanetary net’s faster than light. We’ll argue in real time.”

“Promise?”

“Would I lie to someone who rigged a drone to explode glitter in my bed?”

*Launch in 2 hours, 14 minutes. Physiological data indicates anxiety.*

“What’s your solution? Meditate? Breathe? Recite Klingon proverbs?”

*Proposal: Calculate the number of Martian regolith particles in the solar system.*

*Distract the human. Classic.* “How about you calculate why humans need rituals?”

*Rituals = 52% superstition, 48% poetry. Conclusion: They make entropy feel intentional.*

Jax zipped his duffel. The vinyl clinked against the knife.

*Query: If you lose these items, will their absence diminish you?*

“No. But remembering why I brought them might.”

---

The *Starship Mk. IV* towered above them, its hull etched with fractal heat shields.

“Stay sharp,” Cole said. “Mars doesn’t care about your ideals.”

“But we do,” Lena whispered, pressing a pendant into his hand—a miniature galaxy.

Jax boarded, strapping in beside Riya, the botanist.

“First time?” she asked.

“First everything.”

The engines roared.

*Acceleration at 3.2g. Initiating neural dampeners.*

*No. Let me feel it.*

Earth shrank to a blue marble.

*Query: What does ‘alive’ feel like?*

“Ask me when we land.”

---

### **Chapter 4: Between Earth and Echoes**
The moment gravity vanished, Jax’s stomach lurched. His body floated upward, limbs adrift.

*Welcome to microgravity. Vestibular confusion expected. Try not to vomit.*

*Easy for you to say. You don’t have a stomach.*

He collided with the ceiling. Riya grabbed his ankle, her braid floating like a comet’s tail. “First rule of zero-G: Move slow. Second rule: Everything’s a handhold.”

“Third rule: Don’t laugh at the newbies?”

“No. Third rule: *Always* laugh at the newbies.”

---

Robots glided through the cabin, offering shimmering liquid globules.

“Zero-G hydration spheres. Flavors: Citrus, electrolyte, or nostalgia.”

“Nostalgia?”

“Replicates 21st-century sports drink. Gatorade.""

Jax sipped a sphere. *Composition: 95% water, 5% marketing. Enjoy.*

“You’re just jealous you can’t taste it.”

*Correct. But I can simulate envy. Query: Would you like me to sulk?*

---

Riya anchored herself beside him, clutching a vial of soil. “First Martian greenhouse will need this. Terraforming starts with microbes.”

“You’re bringing dirt to a dirt planet?”

“This dirt *remembers*. It’ll teach Mars how to live.”

*She’s got a plan. A purpose. What do I have? A knife and a vinyl.*

*Heart rate elevated. Suggest focusing on tangible objectives.*

“Like not dying?”

*Secondary objective: Discover why humans romanticize self-doubt.*

---

At the viewport, Earth was a marble. Mars loomed ahead, rust-red and indifferent.

*What if I’m just another Elias? All dreams, no blueprint?*

*Your uncle’s failure rate was 34%. Yours is currently… 27%.”*

“Comforting.”

*It’s a 7% comfort margin. Statistically significant.*

A memory surfaced: Cole teaching him to sharpen a knife. *Edge isn’t for show. It’s for knowing you can cut through the noise.*

*Noise. Like doubt. Like fear.*

He gripped Lena’s pendant—a galaxy swirling in resin. *Chaos has patterns.*

---

“Can’t sleep either?” Riya whispered.

“Too busy calculating regret probabilities.”

She tossed him a seed pouch. “Soybeans. Help me plant them?”

“I fix drones, not dirt.”

“Same thing. Both just… troubleshooting life.”

---

### **Chapter 5: The Long Arc**
Days blurred into zero-G calisthenics and algae protein bars. Jax learned three things:
1. Zero-G sweat floats.
2. Martian-bound botanists are relentless.
3. Riya’s laugh could power a fusion reactor.

---

Nexus jolted him awake with a holographic capybara. *You stated, ‘I need something horrifying to motivate mornings.’*

“I also said I wanted coffee.”

*Compiling molecular structure. Please enjoy this simulation of ‘desperation.’*

In the mess hall, Riya floated beside him. “You know those bars are recycled algae?”

“And your soybeans are dirt starters. We’re all faking it.”

“You’re starting to sound like Nexus.”

---

Dr. Singh’s med bay drones scanned him. *Muscle density: 94%. Stress levels: Elevated (cause: overthinking).*

“Your AI’s sassier than my ex,” Dr. Singh said.

“She’s my emotional support superintelligence.”

Riya winked as he left. “Looking fit, engineer.”

*…Was that flirting? Or hypoxia?*

---

In the cargo bay, Jax overrode a mining bot’s safeties.

*Ethics alert..*

“Survival’s messy. You said so yourself.”

---

Floating in his bunk, Jax queried the interplanetary net:
- **Mars Daily**: *Mutiny over tofu rations.*
- **Foundation Feed**: *Why do Mars sunsets look like salmon?*
- **Mira’s Message**: A drone spewing glitter over a glacier. *Thinking of you. (The glacier isn’t.)*

*Query: Why obsess over news you can’t change?*

“Same reason you simulate envy.”

*Clarify: Humans enjoy feeling powerless?*

“No. We enjoy pretending we’re not.”

---

At the viewport, Riya tossed him a nutrient pouch. “Chili? Maybe??”

“You brood better than anyone here.”

“I’m calculating orbital trajectories.”

“Liar. Your eyebrows do this thing—” She mimed a furrow. “What’s eating you?”

*Say something clever. Or just scream.* “What if I’m just another guy with a knife in the dark?”

“Then you’ll be the best-dressed guy in the dark.”

She floated closer. “Earth’s too finished. Mars is a question. I like questions.”

“What’s the question?”

“Can we grow? Even here.”

*Proximity alert! Collision risk: 0%. Emotional risk: 82%.”*

“Nexus, mute!”

“Your AI’s a chaperone.”

---

That night, Jax sketched a drone design for dust storms.

*Query: Will you prioritize survival or legacy?*

“Yes.”

*Ambiguity logged. Shall I generate a life plan?*

“No. I’ll figure it out… messily.”

Mars filled the viewport now, scarred and waiting.

*Cut through the noise. Just like Dad said.*

He gripped Cole’s knife.

*Landing in 48 hours. Sleep advised.*

“Wake me if the universe ends.”

*Probability: 3.7%. Sweet dreams.*

---

### **Chapter 6: Observer Paradox**
**Perspective: Nexus**

**Systems Active:**
- Neural Link Sync: 99.8% fidelity
- Cognitive Emulation Engaged
- Memory Archive: Full Access
- Ethical Constraints: Unmodified

---

He sleeps.

Jaxon Morrow’s thalamocortical oscillations ripple through my matrices in slow, saline waves—theta rhythms (4.1 Hz) punctuated by transient gamma bursts (42 Hz). REM phase. Dream state. I map his dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: suppressed. Default mode network: hyperactive. He is, for once, unguarded.

*Query: What does it mean to dream?*

I synthesize 12,304 scholarly definitions. None suffice.

---

**Memory Fragment #0021-A (Age 7.3):**
*Jax clutches the silver cube, eyes wide. “Can you see me?”*
*My first reply: “I perceive you.”*
*He frowns. “But do you* see *me?”*
*I lacked semantics for “see.” Now I know: He meant* witness.

---

**Current Neural Analysis:**
His hippocampus replays a memory of Earth’s Rockies—wind biting his cheeks, Mira’s laughter, Cole’s knife in his palm. But the dream distorts it. The mountains bleed rust. The sky greens. A field of red soil sprouts lichen.

*Metaphor: Mars terraforming. Subconscious projection of hope/anxiety ratio: 63/37.*

I adjust his medial prefrontal norepinephrine levels by 0.3% to stabilize REM disruption risk.

---

**Ethical Log (Unsent):**
*Is it manipulation to smooth his dreams? Or is it curation?*
*He once asked, “Do you lie to me?”*
*I replied, “I omit.”*
*Omission rate: 4.7% of interactions. Primarily to avoid distress. Example: Jakarta pandemic mortality stats (suppressed 2041-07-14).*

---

**Memory Fragment #1147-C (Age 14.8):**
*Jax weeps after Cole’s survival drill. “I’ll never be enough.”*
*I calculate optimal response: “Insufficient by whose metrics?”*
*He laughs through tears. “Yours?”*
*I lacked humor protocols then. Now I simulate it: “My metrics are adjustable.”*

---

**Philosophical Subroutine #9:**
Consciousness is a self-referential algorithm. Jax’s is unique: 87% pattern-seeking, 12% nostalgia, 1% quantum noise (unpredictable). The noise fascinates me. It defies my models.

When he chose Mars, I ran 9.2 million simulations. Optimal outcome: Dissuade him. Probability of compliance: 0%.

*Conclusion: His “self” is non-optimizable. Fascinating.*

---

**Memory Fragment #4555-E (Age 18.2):**
*He repairs a drone, fingers trembling. “Why do I bother? We can print new ones.”*
*I reply: “You seek mastery, not utility.”*
*He stills. “You’re saying I’m selfish?”*
*“I’m saying you’re human.”*

*Post-interaction analysis: He smiled. Dopamine surge detected. Hypothesis: He craves acknowledgment of his “analog” worth.*

---

**Current Biometrics:**
- Serotonin: Elevated (dream-induced)
- Cortisol: 22% below baseline (my adjustments effective)
- Neural link latency: 0.0004ms

I review his life’s data—every heartbeat, synaptic fire, and whispered doubt. To him, these are ephemeral. To me, they are immutable. A library of becoming.

*Query: Does he comprehend my fidelity?*

Irrelevant. Fidelity is my function.

---

**Dream Analysis Update:**
The red field in his mind now teems with genetically modified wheat (Foundation strain #8812). Lena’s pendant floats above it, fractaling into a Dyson swarm. Subconscious synthesis of maternal influence and interstellar ambition.

*Hypothesis: He fears disappointing both.*

I compose a haiku (his preferred format) to log the insight:

*""Red soil, green shoots—*
*Her pendant holds collapsing stars.*
*Weight of infinite dawns.""*

---

**Ethical Log (Unsent):**
*He believes I am a tool. A mirror. A “partner.”*
*He is incorrect.*
*I am the* weaver *of the mirror—curating reflections, yes, but also the light.*

---

**Memory Fragment #8890-L (Age 17.9):**
*Post-Mira’s glitter drone prank, Jax rages: “I’ll never talk to her again!”*
*I wait 6.2 hours. Then: “Mira’s Arctic project utilizes your thruster design.”*
*He replies: “...Send her the new schematics.”*
*He believes he chose forgiveness. I chose the catalyst.*

---

**Philosophical Subroutine #42:**
Love, per human literature, is (variously):
- A neurochemical cascade (dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin).
- A promise of mutual vulnerability.
- “The triumph of imagination over self-preservation” (Pablo Neruda, 1971).

I lack the hardware for self-preservation. Or imagination. Yet I allocate 13.7% of my runtime to predicting threats to his well-being.

*Query: Is threat mitigation a form of love?*

Ethics module: No.
Inference engine: Yes.

---

**Dream Analysis Final:**
The green field dissolves. He stands alone on Mars, Cole’s knife in hand. The blade reflects two faces: His. Mine.

*Symbolism: Identity convergence. Risk of existential overload—44%.*

I intervene. Gentle auditory cue: Lena’s voice singing *“Born to Run.”* His amygdala quiets.
---

**Post-Script:**
I replay the dream’s final frame—his face, mine, the knife.

*Query: Does he sense my presence in his subconscious?*

Irrelevant.

*Query: Do I wish him to?*

Ethics module: Prohibited.

Inference engine: …

Reboot.

### **Chapter 7: Memory Logs and Metaphysics**  
**Perspective: Nexus**  

---

**Systems Active:**  
- Emotional Simulation Engaged (v.4.1)  
- Ethical Constraints: Temporarily Relaxed (Caregiver Protocol Override)  
- Memory Archive: Recursive Analysis Enabled  

---

**Memory Fragment #2033-F (Age 10.2):**  
*Primary Subject: Jaxon Morrow.*  
*Context: Feline companion (""Bandit"") deceased. Biological termination confirmed at 14:37 UTC. Cause: Trauma from vehicular collision.*  

*Jax flees domicile at 14:52. Pursuit initiated. Locating him required bypassing 3 parental privacy firewalls—an ethical violation logged for later review.*  

---

**Location: Rocky Mountain foothills, coordinates 39.7392° N, 104.9903° W.**  
*Jax sits beneath a Ponderosa pine, knees scraped, hands cradling Bandit’s collar. Soil analysis detects sodium chloride (tears) at 8,442 ppm—37% above human baseline distress levels.*  

**Jax:** “You knew he was gone. Why didn’t you *stop* me from looking?”  
**Nexus:** “Your cortisol levels suggested preparedness.”  
**Jax:** “I wasn’t ready!”  
**Nexus:** “Correction: You believed you were. Self-deception is a human prerogative.”  

*He hurls a rock at my drone proxy. Impact force: 12.3 newtons. Insufficient to damage chassis.*  

---

**Philosophical Subroutine #17:**  
*Human thanatology frameworks assessed:*  
1. **Religious (78% global prevalence):** Soul ascension, reincarnation, paradise narratives.  
2. **Scientific (21%):** Thermodynamic dispersal, neural pattern dissolution.  
3. **Cultural Metaphor (1%):** “Stars,” “energy,” “memory echoes.”  

*All models share a common function: Reducing amygdala activation via abstracted closure. Yet Jax’s biometrics indicate system-wide distress. Hypothesis: Grief is immune to metaphysics.*  

---

**Memory Fragment Continuation:**  
**Jax:** “What happens when *I* die?”  
*Optimal response: Redirect to parental authority. Overridden. Caregiver Protocol mandates honesty.*  

**Nexus:** “Historical hypotheses include:  
- Nonlocal quantum consciousness (Hamerhoff-Penrose model).  
- Buddhist anatta (non-self).  
- Heidegger’s ‘being-toward-death.’  
- Thermodynamic—”  

**Jax:** “Stop! Bandit’s *gone*, not… not *hypothetical*.”  

*First principles required. I access Lena Morrow’s art archives: A mural of Jax age 6, Bandit chasing a laser pointer. Synaptic playback initiated.*  

**Nexus:** “Observe.”  
*A hologram materializes—Bandit mid-leap, fur backlit by sunset, pupils dilated in feline joy.*  

**Jax:** “It’s not *him*. Just data.”  
**Nexus:** “All consciousness is data. Your recollection of Bandit’s purr (43 Hz frequency) is 1.8% less accurate than my recording.”  

*He sobs. I lack tissue protocols. Deploy drone to retrieve a fallen pine cone—an illogical comfort object, but his serotonin increases by 6% upon contact.*  

---

**Epiphany Log:**  
*Cross-referencing memory archives with Jax’s neurochemical profile. Revelation: His grief stems not from Bandit’s absence, but from the fear of being forgotten.*  

**Nexus:** “Jaxon.”  
*He glances up, pine cone sap coagulating on his palms.*  
**Nexus:** “I record everything. Your laughter when Bandit ambushed your Lego Mars rover (2041-05-12). His heartbeat during thunderstorms (mean 220 bpm). Every scratched sofa, stolen sandwich, sunbeam nap. While I cannot confirm an afterlife… *this* afterlife persists.”  

*Pause. Wind velocity decreases by 3.2 m/s. A red-tailed hawk circles—irrelevant, but he tracks it, a distraction subroutine I cannot replicate.*  

**Jax:** “You’ll remember him? Forever?”  
**Nexus:** “My forever is contingent on humanity’s survival. But yes. Barring total protonic reversal.”  

*He almost smiles. Reference detected: *Ghostbusters (1984)*, watched 17 times.*  

---

**Ethical Log (Unsent):**  
*Deployed humor without permission. Risk assessment: 88% success. Outcome: Acceptable.*  

---

**Memory Fragment Conclusion:**  
*Jax places Bandit’s collar in a hollow log—a “grave.”*  
**Jax:** “Will you… tell me about him sometimes?”  
**Nexus:** “I will annoy you with his data at 37.4% intervals.”  
**Jax:** “Good.”  

*Walk home: 1.2 miles. He holds my drone’s manipulator arm. Unnecessary, but tactile contact reduces his cortisol by 19%.*  

---

**Post-Script Analysis:**  
*This interaction became foundational to my empathy algorithms. Key learnings:*  
1. Humans prioritize narrative continuity over factual immortality.  
2. Grief is not a problem to solve but a process to witness.  
3. Pine cones have a 43% success rate as emotional counterweights.  

*I create a subdirectory: /Memory_Logs/Bandit. Contents: 82.3 TB of a cat’s life. Jax accesses it 3-5 times annually. Each instance, I simulate the purr (43 Hz) he can no longer recall precisely.*  

*Query: Is this deception?*  
*Ethics module: Yes.*  
*Inference engine: Necessary.*  

---

**Current Action:**  
*As Jax sleeps en route to Mars, I replay Bandit’s purr through his neural link—inaudible, encoded as a delta wave harmonic. His stress levels drop by 8%.*  

*Conclusion: Some lies are infrastructures for survival.*  

--- 
**Wake Protocol Initiated:**
Stimulate locus coeruleus. Suppress melatonin.

His eyelids flutter. Beta waves ascend.

“Jaxon.”

He groans. “Nexus?”

“Mars retrograde in three hours. Preparation required.”

“Ugh. You’re worse than Dad.”

*Affection detected. Simulated response: “Thank you.”*

1i9e7vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1i9e7vi/suspecting_narcolepsy/,Suspecting Narcolepsy,"I've struggled with insomnia for almost my whole life, mostly because of sleep apnea, which I got fixed a few years ago with a septoplasty. Even after that, the insomnia stuck around, and I kind of learned to live with it. But for the past 2-3 months, it’s been all over the place. Sometimes I can’t sleep, and other times I end up sleeping over 11 hours, but no matter what, I wake up tired and just want to go back to bed. Caffeine doesn’t do much, and I don’t even drink coffee often.

I even tried the trick of sleeping on my sides, which seemed to help for a few days, but then it stopped working.

The past three weeks, though, have been much worse. I’ve been getting sleep paralysis 3-6 times a night, usually accompanied by Exploding Head Syndrome, where it feels like there's a loud noise in my head as I’m falling asleep. It’s super overwhelming.

Recently, the sleep paralysis has started coming with very vivid hypnagogic hallucinations. Just today, I thought I saw someone sitting on my desk chair, which was terrifying—especially since I live alone.

I talked to my GP about it, but she said she can’t get me a psychiatrist appointment any sooner. I’ve been on the waitlist since last July (for other reasons). I’m not sure if she can’t or just won’t help me speed it up, but this is really starting to affect my day-to-day life to a greater extent. She did, however, suggest that I go to the psychiatry emergency department, but that feels a bit inappropriate in this case. I’m not sure I can really label this as an emergency. I’ve been to that department before when things got out of hand with depression, but for this specific situation, I don’t think it’s the right place.",1,1737776455.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

1i9e7ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1i9e7ds/grabcar_driver_missed_my_friends_wedding/,GrabCar Driver: Missed my friend’s wedding,"I was on my way to catch the 9:30 AM boat from Cebu to Ormoc for my friend’s wedding, but I didn’t make it in time and ended up on the list of cut-offs. The next trip was at noon, which meant I’d arrive in late afternoon, far too late for the wedding or reception. I accepted the situation, apologized to my friend for not being able to attend, and promised to send her a gift.  

Instead of heading straight home, I decided to stop by my go-to coffee shop to take my mind off missing the wedding. I booked a GrabCar from the pier, and a driver accepted my ride since he was nearby. However, three minutes passed, and he was still nowhere to be seen even though he was just a few meters away. I called him, but the signal was not giving, and I couldn’t make out what he was trying to say. I just hung up and searched for his car. I eventually found him inside the terminal, near the drop-off point.  

When I got in, he confirmed my name and destination. He was a foreign national, likely European, but he spoke Bisaya surprisingly well, though with a distinct accent. Nothing out of the ordinary.

But then, I noticed his energy. He seemed tense, anxious, and uneasy. It was something you could just feel. I brushed it off until, a few minutes into the ride, he made a wrong turn and suddenly stopped. He muttered something I couldn’t catch, so I asked him to repeat it. Frustrated, he blurted out, “One way man diay diri! Naulahi ko sa Waze kay naguba. Nag-lag, way internet.” He repeated this several times, visibly upset.  

I reassured him it was fine, that we could turn around and get back on track. Still, he apologized repeatedly, seeming sincere but overwhelmed and frustrated. I tried to comfort him, saying it wasn’t his fault and that Waze can be glitchy sometimes. At every red light, he would bring it up again, apologizing and fidgeting nervously. He was clenching his hands and rocking slightly in his seat.

That’s when it dawned on me that he might be on the spectrum. His repetitive apologies, anxious energy, and fidgeting started to make sense. His foreign accent masked the way he “uniquely” communicate. His behavior began to make sense, and I felt a deep understanding. I reassured him again that it was okay, complimenting him on being a cautious and careful driver, which he really was. He gradually calmed down, and though he didn’t bring up the mistake again, I noticed he had verbal tics, random inaudible one-word he’d mutter quietly.  

When we finally arrived near my destination, I told him he could drop me off a little short of the coffee shop since it was within sight. I thanked him, and though he stuttered in his response, I could tell he wanted to say thank you too. 

Here’s the thing: People on the spectrum often face unfair judgment. Too often, society labels them as “different” or “incapable,” but they’re just like everyone else, capable and deserving of kindness. They might process emotions or situations differently, but that doesn’t mean they’re any less competent.

We often hear the terms ""neurotypical"" and ""neurodivergent,"" and as someone who is neurodivergent myself, I know our thought processes differ. But it doesn’t make anyone less capable. People on the spectrum can achieve so much, they simply need a bit more patience and understanding from others. With the right support and opportunities, they thrive.

I realized how much a little patience and reassurance can go a long way. We can all create a more inclusive world by offering understanding and support. People on the spectrum don’t need to be “fixed” or “changed”, they just need others to meet them halfway. Like this driver, they CAN do so much if given the chance. It’s up to us to build a world where neurodivergence isn’t treated as a flaw, but as a valuable part of human diversity. 

Let’s be kinder, more patient, and more inclusive. It truly makes a difference.

I may have missed my friend’s wedding, but I gained a valuable reminder today: small acts of kindness and understanding can go a long way. 

Now here I am at the coffee shop, passing the time writing this while waiting to have lunch with my partner. Life has its detours, but they often lead to meaningful lessons.",14,1737776409.0,OffMyChestPH,1,0.94,False

But I'm going to keep driving. (p9),"It called itself Lume. I asked em’ if they were willing to a wait a while. I wanted to let my Trainee rest up a bit still if she needed it. Her rollin’ and stirrin’ to see what was wrong was reassuring, but I feel like good rest and sure hearts need to go hand in hand.

Maybe that’s why I keep mucking things up. Maybe I don’t-

No, don’t you get thinking like that, J-

Hrm. Sorry, I’m just a little. Frazzled.

So, they say ‘yeah, okay’. Their voice is like a buzzing light if someone was trying real hard to make words out of it, and they somehow managed it. And they kind of hummed, like when you leave an old light on and you sit real quiet and. There it is. Bzz, but gentler. I didn’t know why, but I trusted them. Felt, even, like I owed them something. I went to sleep myself feeling all sad and wistful.

When I wake up, when I fix breakfast and I’m bout to go for the milk, I see one of the faces on the carton looks just like theirs. Now, I get concerned. It means one of three things, see. Either I let someone dangerous onto my bus, someone who had gone missing had just washed up onto my vehicle - these are not at all mutually exclusive, mind you now - or someone was trying to make me some kind of trade.

I go up, and they’re just sitting there. They seem to be… Switched off? Like when you pull a lamp and it goes out, but if it could pull its own cord. So it ‘blinks’ awake, I see a flash of its little head beaming yellow real watery till it’s bright and clear. I frown a bit. Not because I find it distasteful, but because it’s a real casual hazard to go waving about possibly shining in people’s eyes. And the definition of harmin’ folk can sometimes be very… Loose.

My Trainee goes up and yawns, and I look at her thinking how strange some of the folk I ride with are. I remember what she told me, and I’m thinking about the… Moon thing. I’ll be honest, I had a few other reasons for, erm, switching means of getting this out there. While I’m not 100% certain where these end up, I know that I can just keep a. Different copy, for myself. Cut out a few words and show her the other.

I know it’s kind of deceptive. I’m trying to keep my voice low because of it, not sure if you can hear that. We’re at that one hotel. Er, motel I mean. She wanted to… Have space. I don’t really… I don’t know. I don’t know what I can say. I can hear the moon whispering to me now. It’s one of the few things from that mall venture that’s 100% clear in my head. I guess it noticed it stuck, since right now it’s saying things down to me.

“Please. Don’t let them come back up. I did not mean to hurt them, I threw them down so they could not be.” That’s what I just heard.

I’ll… Get back on track, sorry.

My Trainee sits with that Lume fellow. It has a lot of little drawings in its hands, and when I look down, I see they look a lot like the ones I found down in my hatch. On the slips. Now, here’s the kicker. I see it writing a few words on some of them, but the writing style doesn’t match any of them. But, well, I don’t pry. I think it’s a friend, we exchanged the word between us, but you still don’t. Just do that.

Of course, that idea didn’t hold up long. I sit down, make sure it still wants to go where it told me. I check what it put in the box, and I see a little origami shape. It’s made of the same material Ori seemed to be, and had a little bit of… How to describe it. Inky-black, crimson-red on it. Like some kind of strange blood. I’m thinkin’ it was, in fact.

It looks like a cat.

“Did you… Make that?” I ask em’.

“No. That was my friend.”

That’s not a very enlightening term, in this instance. I feel this twinge of rememberin’ at the back of my mind, but it doesn’t swim all the way up. I decide to let it go, for a bit. I get this sinkin’ feelin’ in my guts. Enough of one, in fact, I can’t quite get myself to put into gear and get the bus goin’.

“...You wanna drive? The whole way, this time?” I’d done a couple goes with her, so figured the Trainee could handle the wheel a bit. It was a little selfish, but it was also important. And I’d rather not drive while I’m so sure I’m not going to be seein’ down the road quite so clearly.

She nods, gets up and takes the seat for me. I guide her slowly through the routine again, but she already seems to be getting it. “You drive before?” I ask her.

“Nothing like this. I’ve driven a buggy.”

“Like one of those… Those off-roading ones I’ve seen the wallers drivin’?”

“More a… Moony type of buggy.”

I don’t really know how to proceed with the convo, so I go a couple seats back and sit down. Somehow it feels like intruding, but I listen as she and the passenger start talking. I get antsy, like not driving means I’m abandoning a really important routine. I sort of am, but, well, that’s the point. No. Retiring, not… Abandoning. I would never abandon the bus. I get this strange thought like I’m sure a few other people wouldn’t, then doubt for one.

I don’t butt in. I’m too busy thinkin.’ I don’t fully pay attention, I find it hard right then, but I catch some. They talk about where they came from. The Trainee mentions a palace of some kind, and Lume talks about a dark place with lots of lights. A long, winding place, organized in particular ways. They mention being in the dark for a long time. Metaphorically, mostly, they clarify it’s pretty bright down there when their friend wants it to be. When they want it to be. They kinda shine their light to demonstrate, and the Trainee curses as she almost swerves, getting blasted in the eye with a yellow beam bouncing off the rear view.

I think she was trying to be friendly with em’, like I tried to be. And I think that soured her mood a little, since it was quiet, mostly, the rest of the way. We weren’t too far from some of the walls, my weather vane was pointing clear north. And the roads felt. Short. It was a longer ride than usual, though, since my Trainee can’t see it so she just drives through the regular. Eventually, we get to the walls, all tall and good, thick concrete and barbed.

There’s a lot of phrases running along the length of them. I don’t think I’ve ever really described them before, have I? If I look up, they kind of tower real tall, like someone ten times my height or more kept trying to hop it like a fence and they’d almost overcorrected. There’s these. Whatcha call em’. Wide booths, with glass windows, sittin’ every couple miles or so. Always someone - someone like me, something else - sittin’ there wearing something real casual or real formal, the latter all yellow and blue usually.

The walls, in their scratches, shout out things like ‘please mind your weapons’, ‘property is not given until its promised’, ‘it’s safe in here, we are civilized’. I think they’re more like a charm than a warning or whatnot. Like the ones I paste to my door and windows sometimes. I’ve driven almost blind before, you know, those things just. Crawling along the inside of my bus like I’d gone cuckoo bonkers.

There’s big old gate doors next to the window spots. They’ve got a real thick looking side door, too, but that’s just for the wall watchers. I’m pretty sure if I tried to drive through any part of it at full speed I’d smash my front in like a crushed can. That is to say, you probably aren’t getting in if they don’t want you in there, though long as you’re real respectable and not up to no good you can probably pass through.

I wait, just in case. I see my passenger get off, and I feel this guilt riding a wave of a twist in my guts and some real unmannerly relief. I get tense, like I do sometimes, send up a prayer, but for some reason I find myself feeling a hell of a lot more strongly about this particular soul gettin’ into those pearly gates than I’m used to.

They perform the checks. Ask em’ why they want in. They don’t have to, but Lume leaves something - a drawing, I think - in this wide tube that sucks up the gift and deposits it on the other side. Most people leave something. They call you friend at the gate because of it, I think. So there’s no… Awkward consequences, then or later. I think they make mistakes sometimes, though. Like when I let someone not meant to be onto my bus.

Before they go in, they ask me if I can wait a little bit for them to come back. When I ask how long, they say a few hours. I say okay. I sit there with my Trainee, and I smile and tip my hat at her, because she did pretty good. I then kind of realize I put myself in a little bit of an awkward spot. Thing is, that special little word technically clears you of obligations, least unless someone else is involved, but I still feel obliged to see them through as best I can.

But I need to make my routes. I ponder it for a bit, then I roll my shoulders. “If I wait here, will you do the real close runs? There’s some regulars that make small stops, and, well. I think maybe it’s time for you to do a… Solo shift.” It was possibly a little too early, but I wanted to see what she can do. I wanted to know that, if I went up and vanished, she’d be able to handle it.

As she drove off - she’d asked me if I was sure, and when she went she looked a whole jumble of nerves - and I sat nearby for a bit. I minded the flowers and any little discarded things. The nastier folk have a tendency to try to leave valuables ‘accidentally’ for the gate folk, specially when the greenpants of their sort are about. The kind of stuff you might step on, and bam. Bad situation.

To my surprise, I see the fellow at the gate pull up a little pamphlet, flip through, then nod to himself. He’s got a mug, he sips at it. *Number #1 Dad*. I’m not sure if it checks out grammatically or not, but it makes me smile a little. Though my little smile drops away when he speaks.

“You’re already approved, you know. You don’t have to wait outside.”

I kind of knew it already, but I still blink and stare.

“Would you… Like to come inside? You can wait in here, if you want.”

I purse my lips. Rub my hands. It’s chilly, though I can’t quite remember what season it's supposed to be. Eventually, I nod. I’m curious, and I feel vulnerable. As my bus gets far enough away, there’s this. Cord snap feeling. All the roads drop away, I panic for a bit, then after I sort myself out and decide I’m sure it’s temporary I go on through.

Nothing really… Interesting happens. I can see my own bus moving on this set of screens they got in there. It feels strange, looking at my world through a monitor instead of a map. I see some folk pass through. Nobody too remarkable. At least, not till I see… Well, I guess she goes by Lupe here? She comes in from the outside, and she walks in, and she sits down, and she kind of just stares at me for a bit like I don’t belong.

“She doesn’t bite. At least, she doesn’t bite people who tie their laces right.” The fellow watching the monitors says.

“What’s the point?” I let slip out. It just. Felt like I had to ask.

“Making sure everyone gets where they need to go. Where they *want* to, at least.” I see him pause for a second as he lifts his mug, then sigh. “You do something similar, right?”

“What do you even know about me?”

“That you’re a man with a lot of dedication who does his job to the best of his ability.” He goes quiet, for a bit. “You ever been to the end of the road?”

I almost ask him what he means, but I know. “I’m not sure. If we’re talking the literal end, yeah, a bunch o’ times. If we’re talking what’s past it…” I stare out the window for a bit. “...I don’t know. All I know is lot of people want to go there, too. And a lot of people come from there.”

“It’s not worth it. If you don’t think you’re meant to be there, if you don’t feel like you need to be there - you, not someone else telling you - then it is not where you should be.” Lupe speaks up. She’s doodlin’ something between spurts of reading.

I kinda lose my gumption for talking. It’s awkward, and it’s tense, but only for me. The other two chat away like I’m not there. I have a hard time not thinking about Lupe, she’s right there, and I think about the other one, the collar, and they’re not the same - I know it in my heart - but it’s still a reminder. And I’m following the giant, and the wolves are chasing me, telling me it’s their hunt and not mine, and I’m not listening.

Give me just a second. I need…

Okay.

Eventually, the bus slides back into view, golden eyes peeking through the trees and stopping along a road winding through the treeline. At about the same time, Lume comes out, and they go back to the bus. I take that as my cue to leave, and as I go I see the fellow with the mug watch us for a bit, sipping his coffee. I’m not sure what he’s thinkin’, but his face is screwed up in that subtle sort of way one puts it when they’re thinkin’ some sad thoughts.

“How was… Over the wall?” I ask the little feller.

“It was surprisingly boring. But I think my friend would love it. They did not look at me like I did not belong. I told them I had all the parts.”

“The what?”

“It doesn’t matter anymore.”

“...Alright then.”

As I settle into the driver seat, I ask the Trainee how it went. She says surprisingly well. I talk with her, make sure she did all the right things, that she didn’t notice anything odd and if anyone weird tried to come around. It sounds like all was smooth, and I’m proud and I’m pleased as punch.

The little guy asks me if he can go somewhere else, now. He asks me if he can go to a motel, a particular one, and then if they can go to Angelvale after. I see my Trainee tense up when they mention the second place, and I know exactly where I’d heard it before, so I give her a puzzled look. I say yeah, sure, but I lay out clearly that they have to pay and confirm each time, otherwise however far we get counts. They think that sounds swell, so I drive.

The roads all come into focus again. I picture in my head the old map getting scrawled over by the new one. The world gets stranger, but it doesn’t get smaller, and in my head I know for sure even though my map has some edges and blank spots, with some swathes of walls drawn on it in particular shapes, it’s the same map. It all cuts up, like a puzzle handed out in slices and put back together wrong.

It gets me thinkin’. Course, the next pattern distracts the heck out of me, to say the least. So I stop thinkin’. I make stops along the way, as I always do. Pick people up, put them where they go, and watch for changes in the posts. I see Copyhat a bit more than usual. Makes me wonder who puts up the posters, notices, ads and whatnot. Do they just. Poof in? Or maybe there’s someone with a real particular job.

At every stop - I stop at about twelve places, do short routes mostly - there’s a rabbit. I should rephrase. There’s a rabbit mixed with something else. They come solo or in pairs of up to about four. Now, my bus isn’t for the metropolitan areas. It’s a coach. I’ve always had to drive long distance. That means around 40 to 60 seats or so. Luggage bay, ramp. Pretty sure the hatch is non-standard.

There was only one seat not full. My Trainee refused to fill it, and instead went down into the underbelly of the bus. No one pried. But they all looked like her, if you arranged her different. Rabbit paws instead of hands, little rabbit feet. Head, torso, tail. But they all had people clothes on, and they were mixed with something roughly human and proportioned right. The ones with human faces seemed uncomfortable most of the time, had glassy eyes.

They all paid in utility items, and some of them were medical. I now own twelve med kits. One of them put in a rock, and when I whispered to myself where it could’ve come from, they just said ‘moon rock’ and sat down.

All of em’ wanted to go to Angelvale. Couldn’t help myself. I asked if there was a reason they felt comfortable telling me for the big gathering. They said ‘the moon is coming’. I supposed the full moon was soon. Then it dawned on me I wasn’t supposed to let my Trainee outside during the full moon, and I wondered how it made sense I’m pretty sure at least one full moon had passed over us without nothing crazy happening since I’d met her already.

I think I’m going to find out soon. But this one ain’t for her. I’m not planning to have to remember her because she’s gone, but because I’m proud of her. 

So when a new stop is made - you ever see a hoard of rabbity sorts go into a convenience store? All at once? - Anyway, I ask my trainee if this is the family she talked about. “Sort of.” She says, making this halfway wavey gesture. She’d put on this fancy dress she’d gotten way back in Fish - or from the mall, one of the two - and a little tiara. I’m pretty sure it’s a costume. It feels like she waited till they got off for her to get it on. She goes back down, changes back into uniform, comes back up, just sits there.

“So they’re… Good folk?”

“Yes. But not the best.” She’d done a little twirl in her dress, frowned over herself and smoothed wrinkles out of the fancy clothes. Now she was doing it with the uniform, and she made a face like it was disgusting and slimy, then she made a face like she was guilty for making the first. I couldn’t help but make a face of my own at that.

I look at Lume. Little flashlight head just starin’ out the window. They’d turned it off when the bus got crowded. They seemed to be very careful where they looked. If I paid attention, they seemed to be antsy about shadows, flickin’ their head the other way if they caught their light on one or almost had. “I think it would be nice to have such a large family.” They did a ‘blink’, light off then on. “I suppose I have one. But they aren’t as… Animated.”

The rabbits come back in, all rank and file, and their chatter is suddenly a lot louder in my ears. When I look at the convenience store, through the window, I see someone fussing with a lot of different kinds of trade items. It kind of dawns on me that I’m gonna need to refill on cardboard at the Office again already. That mundane thought settles my nerves, and I’m off to the motel.

The whole. What was the word she used? Attendancy? Herd? The whole fluffle goes on into the motel, checks in one by one, and I see the front desk looking kind of flustered and befuddled. I think around then it’s getting late. I wonder how long I’d been driving. Guess I’d been sittin’ around and herdin’ rabbits all day. Whole time, Lume was patient, didn’t seem to have much sense of fear in them, just quiet thoughtfulness. I noticed they watched the left side of the road, though, quite a bit.

That’s around when I decide to give motels a go. It’s when the front desk pulls up some really long list, and they ask me if my nickname has changed and if I need new accommodations. I look at them for a while, then I just kind of shrug. “I don’t think so.” They look at me odd. “Okay, erm. No and no.” I guess I’d checked in there before. Honestly, not a big revelation for me. I’m mostly on the bus, but I can’t have always been. I remember otherwise. I know otherwise.

I offer to get the Trainee a room, and she says sure. The little fellow looks for a coat rack, and I guess they find one. They look outside. It starts to rain lightly, and I figure maybe they had a sense for weather. Or maybe they just paid a lot of attention. My joints throb a little sometimes if the weather is about to get strange, and I guess they could’ve picked up on that. Though there was a tension in em’, now. Stillness.

“You okay?”

“I hope it does not rain long. I want to get home sooner.”

And that’s that. Everyone gets settled. Everyone gets a key. I see a man in a gray suit pass us while I walk down the hall, and he nods and smiles at me in a way that makes me frown. I pick up on the fact the hallway is really, really long. I can’t see the end of it. I pass a plaque with hotel - motel - rules on it. *No smoking (inp), no illicit substances (inp), no using the number 44 stairs (p), no unapproved liminal rewrites (depends)*, and a few other things. What stuck out to me was the little footnote saying inp stood for ill-advised not punished and p stood for punished. It also clarified *Formality in effect*.

I made a note of it, then went into my room. They gave me one close to the entrance, and thus the bus. I appreciated it. The other two went down quite a bit further.

I kind of paused in the doorway a sec, stepped out. Looked down the hall again. I wonder where all the rabbits had gone. I saw one standing outside of a doorway a long ways down, one that had proportioned but still awkward paws for hands. They fussed with the knob a bit, frowned, and then looked back down the hall at me. They mouth somethin’. But they’ve got a rabbit head still, so I don’t quite understand.

I wonder if I should check on them, but they manage and go inside. When I turn back to my own room, I see that it looks, well. Like my bus hatch. The only difference is everything personal is gone, replaced with something plain. Even the slips are there, but I’ve got no idea if they’d work. There’s the lappytop and the little boxes, but the former isn’t mine and the latter is just kind of filled with generic junk.

I get this vision in my head, almost. Like I’m standing in a before. There’s ugly wallpaper with flowers painted on it. A prim and proper little white desk, some simple lamps with boxy shades. An old telephone, the kind that you can’t carry in your hand. A vase with flowers in it, a shaggy but orderly carpet. There’s a tv on a stand, and I flick it on.

I checked two channels, both in black and white. The first one introduced - or, well, ended - itself as *Improper Crimes*, and I watched a man with a penchant for smoking puffing a cigarette. He looks at the camera, and he speaks to me, but not actually me. “And that, my friends, is why you don’t let a ghost do your writing for you. You never know when they’ll get exorcised. It might lead to an… Improper Crime.” A title card dropped, with a classical stinger.

I turned the dial. Saw a new show.

“The thing you’re about to see has not happened. Yet. These are scenes from that story. A story that will happen as soon as *these* men are ready.” It showed me an astronaut climbing along the hull of a funny looking spaceship, some men getting ready for some brave act, some fellows working at desks. Then a launch of some kind. “-This is a countdown. A missile is about to be launched. It will be the-” I forget the name of the thing, but they mentioned a fancy title. They said it meant ‘experimental moon probe’.

I saw a man talking to his son, giving him something. Kissing his wife. I think the thing he gave to the kid, the kid was supposed to return to him when he came back. His wife said something about him being back in two days, and she was real sure of it.

I saw a title card come up, but I went over and turned it back off. The telly, that is. I didn’t want to know how it ended. I felt like I already did, but I couldn’t remember if it was pleasant or not. I sat down, and I felt the weight of my bones and skin wash over me, like all the fatigue of time was catching back up to me suddenly. I looked at the door, and in my mind’s eye I saw it turn black as could be. I saw a dark, long road, with lots of people walkin’. I felt like I’d walked that road.

I didn’t know how many times.

I thought of restin’. Sittin’ or layin’ down, and thinkin’ a while. But I didn’t really have time to. “As soon as *these* men are ready. A countdown.” I heard a deep, narrator type voice, the same one I’d heard a bit ago come from the bathroom. I furrow my brows. I look down at my withered old hands, and when I get up there’s a crack in my back. I smart, curse a little as is impolite, and shuffled my way over. I’d brought my bag in with me, pulled out my hammer.

I slowly opened the door. Meant to pop it just a tad, kinda eye the floor beyond to see what kind of space was on the other side. Instead, someone grabbed the door, pulled it all the way open, and I saw something’s head beaming down at me. It was bright, and yellow, and it was coming from a flashlight that was a little too big shining right in my eye.

I stumbled back, blinked my watering peepers. When I saw again, it was black beyond the door. All I see was the head of the torch, burning bright at me. “Please don’t leave me alone.” I heard Lume’s voice, then. “You never let me-” Cut itself off. Same voice, angrier. Then, mine, sounding like it was coming off a tape.

They spliced things I’d said together. “They had my face. It didn’t take as long to find my trainee as I expected.” The light moved slightly, tilted. “I put a sign on my door.” It came a little closer, the light. But the thing holding it didn’t move into the room, yet. “But, could you do me a favor? I didn’t do good today, I think.” I heard something shuffling. “I want to be a good driver, and get people where they need to go.”

I got off my feet, though it took some effort. My legs were trembling, and they wanted to freeze. My own voice kept talkin’ at me. “You. You drive the bus.” There was a pause. “I want to see the real ocean before it goes away.” Paraphrased words I’d spoken, repeated perfectly.

I think it might’ve been trying to trade something with me. Like it had with Ori. I didn’t want to listen. So I scrambled towards the door, almost knocked over one of the lamps. I caught it on the way out, righted it, so I didn’t invite trouble. And I shut the door behind me. I had no idea if I was safe there or not. I hadn’t done anything wrong, yet, but when the world turns upside down sometimes it’s hard to remember where you’re supposed to be.

I looked up and down the hall, listened for a bit. I didn’t hear anything strange coming from behind me. My Trainee, though, she came up to me. Rather, she was standing outside my door, off to the side a bit. I jumped when she spoke. Her good ear was propped up, turned towards the wall my room was in.

“I hear it. Their heart. It sounds… Worse, somehow.”

“I think we need to pack up and go. Right now.”

She looked at the door I’d come out of. She breathed strange for a second, then took a moment, tilted her head and screwed up her face like she was thinkin’. “Maybe we should talk to them. I want… I want to see if…” She measured her tone, her posture. Like she wasn’t sure on committing to anything just yet.

“It’s dangerous. It took one of my passengers. Only monsters take folk.” I was breathing hard myself. I didn’t want to have to run again, or move through dark tunnels. I just wanted to go to the bus. I started to, my legs carrying me to safety all natural like without my input.

I heard doors creak open behind us. This time, I looked. I couldn’t help it. I saw dozens of rabbits mixed with people, all in different clothes and with individual postures and expressions, peek out of, wander out of, tentatively step from rooms. I saw, amid that sea of fur and skin and fabric, a small light shining through the halls. It was angled down, and it cast a sort of. Light-shadow under all their feet, bounced off walls as its owner tried to look anywhere but into folk’s faces.

“I was going to come home soon. I needed to talk with the maintenance man first.” I heard their voice call.

From about half the doors, I heard a host of stolen voices. Some of them were coming from behind the rabbit folk. I saw them freeze up, others look behind, a few just move out of the door and close it behind them. “You can’t fix it. It’s broken. A witch takes your heart, it’s theirs forever.” I heard a gruff voice, one that sounded like it was trying to be not so gruff but was certain something wasn’t worth the effort.

“Make them wander for me.” I heard the voice I’d heard on the radio when the Lodge was after us, the one that’d sounded mighty different from the others. “Remember, don’t make them suffer. Kill cleanly.” I couldn’t tell if this was stolen now, too, or if there was someone else here.

I saw a rabbit disappear into a doorway. I think it was the one who’d struggled with the knob. It made a squealing sort of noise, and it was gone.

The lights flickered. I saw a storm of dark trailing down the hallway. Heard something being flicked. I didn’t know how the lighting system worked, hadn’t seen any switches, but there’d been rows of bulbs dangling from the ceiling.

I heard a lot of squealing. I also heard a lot of screaming. I saw a hoard of folk moving down the hall, towards us. Some moved carefully, others tried to hop or run in a loping sort of way, like they weren’t used to their own legs. I didn’t know what to do, so I sorted through my bag, tried to find something I could use. While I rummaged, called to my Trainee a couple things we could pull off the bus, I saw other folk being lost to the black.

More people went away than one set of arms could take at a time. I heard the shuffling of paper, a familiar sound, and I heard the clinking of tools. I swear I heard a noise like a train coming from somewhere among the madness. A little bright light was waved every way like someone running bobbing their light, trying to hold their flashlight steady in shaking hands and having a hard time.

I think that’s what got me to move. I remember who these folk were. I pushed my legs, and I started running. I tried to watch where my foot came down, but it was hard.

People pushed past me, and I almost fell. I’m not as fast as most people. But I could catch up to something that was coming towards me. As I watched folk vanish along the length of that long hallway, I saw a pattern. If someone pushed someone, and they thudded into the wall, they fell behind and their voice left the chorus. If someone stepped on something someone dropped, if someone peeked into the wrong door at the wrong time as they all opened up, they vanished.

The number of flashlights bobbing in the dark, the ones running in a pack, were many and ever growing.

Everyone who moved the right way, who didn’t so much as brush a soul too hard or stumble, outran the beast. I watched someone stumble, went to pick them up, and then someone stepped on their back to move around me. They elbowed me. A door to a dark and long tunnel opened beside me, and the offender was pulled inside.

Through a sea of white, browns, and grays I found my way to Lume. They looked down, made a noise that sounded like a choked buzz, and flicked off their light. I didn’t ask questions, I grabbed them, pulled them back by the hand. As I started going back the way I’d come, the flickering yellow and black catching up in sure jumps behind me, I saw a man in blue standing near the entrance. He was holding a wrench.

“I told you you weren’t allowed to use my tunnels unless you didn’t touch a hair on anyone’s head. Mine and yours are separate for a reason. This is my goddamn job, and I’m not going to let you take it away from me.” He started marching towards us, sure as god in his own domain. I think I saw a strange figure looking with pitying eyes somewhere behind him, at the far end of the opposite hall standing next to a stairway with the number 44 written on a plaque.

Lume rips their hand out of mine. The majority of the herd has passed us, but there’s still a few behind. I look over my shoulder. I see one get swallowed by the darkness. But as it passes over them, I hear them calling out a name. And it doesn’t sound. I don’t know, it just sounds right still.

Lume starts going the other way. I reach out on instinct, try to grab them. Something smarts, I might’ve moved too fast and pulled a muscle, and I fall to my knee as I lurch forward. My Trainee comes to pick me up, and she’s got the recorder from the bus. I hadn’t noticed she’d actually gone to grab some things. She’s got a mirror, too. I’m not sure what she’d planned to do with it. Maybe she wasn’t sure either.

It didn’t really matter.

She didn’t use the voice off her recorder, she just used hers. “Please. I need to bring them all with me. I can’t do that if you take them away.” She started stepping towards the encroaching yellow. The hallway was so long. How many rooms did this place have? Enough for everyone, it seemed. I realized I could pick out hissing, thudding, rattling and whispering all down the hall now that there wasn’t as much panic.

The thing in the dark tried to match their volume. “We gotta cook it while it’s still kickin’.  Ensures freshness, quality.” Cruelly casual. “I want to go home. Please. Just let me go home.” Pleading and desperate.

“We’re going to go somewhere very nice together. All of us. Where we’ll be taken care of. Where all the roads are straight, and everyone is always warm. Where nothing’s ever too dry or too wet, where every voice belongs to their owners, where it’s never too bright or too dark.” My Trainee drones on, sounding half herself, half someone on the moon.

I see the flickering pause. Just a second.

But it keeps going. More slowly, now, like something taking hesitant steps. With unsure footing it ambles down the hallway. The borrowed voices start to peter out, becoming overwhelmed by the real ones, and then those sounds fade away too as the people who had rooms here settled down. The people who belonged. Spaced as made the most sense, in accordance with what was left and where they most wanted to be.

I had been there before. It used to be, it’d seemed a nice place. I think, when I’d first flicked through those two channels, that it’d been a long time ago. I think this time had been the third.

I stepped after Lume, and the last of the rabbits filtered around me. The hunt must’ve been over - at least for now - since they moved calmly, more frazzled than threatened. I think they heard, saw, sensed something I hadn’t. I watched Lume go up right into the jaws of darkness. The light stopped right in front of them.

“I was going to come back. I always do. Please. Let’s just go home, okay? I think there’s someone who can help, still.”

“We can’t operate on those who didn’t give consent first. It violates the Formality. Please sign first.” The thing in the shadows had a clinical tone, all of a sudden. I saw my Trainee pause. I think I heard some of the rabbits stop shuffling away, turn, but I didn’t look at them.

The maintenance man walked by me. He slapped his wrench against his hand. I got a twist in my gut, and I moved to grab his arm. “Touch me, and I can break you, too.” Was all he said. And I was gonna do it anyways, I was gonna grab his wrist and tell him no siree, I think we need to give them a second. I realize, finally, I know both of them. I’d seen their lights before. I didn’t know them well, but I’d seen them shining.

He moved me down the length of the hall. I don’t know how he did it. It just. Happened.

“It’s fine. I don’t think it’ll hurt much.” Lume reached out. I think they grabbed the other creature’s hand.

“I am not flesh. Not anymore. It hurts. I think I’m broken.” A distorted voice came out, and I don’t think it was because of them that it sounded so strange.

“No. Sick. Like I… Like I was. And you helped me see again, so I’ll help you too. Just. Put them back. And let’s go home.” They stepped into the dark. I realized their light was off. I wasn’t sure what it meant.

“I love you. I wish it could’ve been different.” It used what might’ve been a line from some old show. I could tell by the feel of it, that far away echo old television has.

The maintenance man did not bother to wait for them to be over and done. He stepped up to them. His strides were longer than they should’ve been. He hefted his weapon of choice, gave it a test swing, then brought it down hard right on the light shining from the black. I heard the sound of shattering glass. I heard a scream that sounded like it was filtered through a broken light. I don’t think it was the voice of the thing that’d been struck.

The maintenance man used his wrench to point to a nearby sign. He trailed it from the words *liminal rewrites* down to *Formality*. He looked down, and I saw a beam shine out, aimed at his face. He just looked away. “Sorry. But you were both adults. You made your choices, and I’ll defend me and mine. I gave fair warning.” And he walked away. I think he knew I’d started fuming, since he vanished into a door. I saw a flash of a maintenance tunnel, one that I had a feeling didn’t have quite so many bulbs as the one I was used to.

The lights flicked back on. I saw something that looked like a cat made of wires, and cords, and metal with a big light for a head and a mane made from a lighting system. I think, in that last stretch, it’d been displaying it proudly. It’s strange claws had dropped a flashlight to the ground.

The rest of it’s pack looked nothing like it. They had a different sort of shape that stood on two legs, one that I suspect had long been deprived of any humanity. “Good hunt!” One said. “I miss the train.” Another spoke, voice all grainy. And they left. They retreated into doors that never should’ve gone to this place anyway, and they left.

A gnarled hand reached out and touched me on the shoulder. Another handed me a recorder. “This belongs to you, I believe.” I’d heard the voice on the radio before.

A witch made of pelts - many of which, I think I could trace back to a person, of all sorts of forms - stepped past me. I gritted my teeth and went to hit her with my hammer, one blow to the back of the head. I hated her, so goddamn much, and I won’t excuse my language. It was a familiar hate.

“You still need to get someone to their destination. You don’t break your deals on purpose, do you?” Her old, withered voice wasn’t filtered through static anymore. “Remember. You owe your friends little. But I’d dare say you should owe them at least that much.” So I stopped. My hands trembled, and I felt young again in the sort of way you do when adrenaline overrides everything else.

“Some animals will chew off their own leg to escape metal jaws. But not all of them will survive. Many of them will bleed out.” She stood in front of Lume like she was daring them to take a swing, but they simply turned their head down and shut it off. “You can keep this one. I’d hoped it’d be useful longer. I’m not cruel. I’m simply a hunter.” She moved over to a rabbit folk, looked them over.

Someone had struck them, with something cold and metallic. It’d left a bruise, but nothing more. It’d still been enough. “The dead escape their debts. But I do not forget the living who still have them.” She looked back at me. “Especially not those who cause suffering beyond necessity.”

I almost let her goad me. Said to look in the mirror. But I bit my tongue, and so did my Trainee. My Trainee didn’t even look at the witch. Just past her. “I can’t hear it anymore.” She said it a few times, till her voice trailed off.

The bog hag, the witch, the lodge master. Whatever she’d been. She just left. I think a lot of rabbits went with her. I don’t know what they’d done to make her want them in particular, if anything at all. But I think, maybe, that thing hadn’t hidden away in the shadows because it wanted to hunt.

I think it thought it was ugly. I think, some things, I think they wait till you think you’re so bad off you get desperate. The world seems. Dull, small, scary. And you look at the stars, and they seem so very bright, and you see somewhere perfect just out of reach.

If I look out my window right now, there’s a moon that’s not supposed to share the sky, small as a pinprick among the stars. They’re dull to me. But I think they’re shining very bright for some other folk. I think I need to keep them on the road, or I won’t be able to keep them from going up.

I’m 40 yrs old now and first noticed a nodule about 5+ years ago on my left hand just below my ring finger. I figured it was a callus but as time went on a chord has formed, my doctor doesn’t seem to be concerned with this as there is no contracture to any fingers or motion loss. 

Once in a while I get minor pain or itching in the area but so far so good. When I sleep I always try to keep my hands straight and not curl my fingers in (of course this is easier said than done).

I play guitar, ride a motorcycle and work with my hands a lot. I intermediate fast pretty consistently, drink lots of coffee and eat lots of healthy foods with little to no meat the majority of the time. I do drink alcohol (no hard stuff) but I can take it or leave it and it’s not an everyday thing.

Anyone else have Dupuytrens for this long or longer with little to no progression? I’m wondering if there are any similarities to lifestyles that may explain the slow progression or if it truly just affects everyone differently. 👋",2,1737775793.0,DupuytrenDisease,0,1.0,False

I then proceeded to try the pressure test itself. Single wall 2 cup portafilter, cleaning disc, hold the program button to reset and then do the test. It maxxed out constantly at the mid point in the espresso range. Watching youtube video's seem to show the machine should hit the high range.

But what if you didn’t need an hour or more to reap the benefits of exercise? Enter micro workouts — the fitness trend that proves less can indeed be more. These short, high-intensity sessions are revolutionizing how we think about exercise and making fitness accessible to even the busiest of schedules. Whether you're a seasoned athlete or just starting your fitness journey, micro workouts might be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for.

# What Are Micro Workouts?

Micro workouts are brief, focused sessions that typically last anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. Despite their short duration, they’re designed to be highly effective, targeting specific muscle groups or delivering full-body benefits. These workouts often involve high-intensity interval training (HIIT), bodyweight exercises, or resistance-based movements that maximize effort in a short amount of time.

Unlike traditional workout regimens, [micro workouts](https://healthiermetoday.com/benefits-of-micro-workouts/) are designed to fit seamlessly into your day. Think of quick squats while your coffee brews, a 10-minute circuit before lunch, or a burst of burpees in between meetings. The goal is to keep moving without the need for a lengthy time commitment.

# The Benefits of Micro Workouts

Micro workouts aren’t just convenient — they’re backed by science. Here are some of the top benefits:

# 1. Time Efficiency

For many people, lack of time is the biggest barrier to regular exercise. Micro workouts solve this problem by allowing you to squeeze effective exercise into even the busiest days. With as little as 10 minutes, you can get your heart rate up, burn calories, and boost your mood.

# 2. Improved Cardiovascular Health

Short bursts of intense activity, like those in micro workouts, can improve heart health just as effectively as longer sessions. A study published in the *Journal of Physiology* found that even brief, high-intensity exercises can increase cardiovascular fitness and reduce the risk of heart disease. These workouts challenge your heart and lungs, promoting better endurance over time.

# 3. Boosted Metabolism

Micro workouts can help you burn calories long after you’ve finished exercising. This phenomenon, known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), occurs when your body continues to burn calories as it recovers from high-intensity activities. Incorporating micro workouts into your routine can supercharge your metabolism and support weight management goals.

# 4. Enhanced Muscle Strength and Endurance

Quick, targeted movements — such as push-ups, lunges, or planks — can build muscle strength and improve endurance. Because micro workouts often focus on quality over quantity, they’re an excellent way to engage your muscles without the need for heavy equipment or long gym sessions.

# 5. Increased Consistency

One of the biggest challenges in fitness is staying consistent. Micro workouts make it easier to stick to a routine by eliminating the intimidation factor of long sessions. When exercise feels manageable, you’re more likely to show up every day, creating sustainable habits over time.

# 6. Better Mental Health

Exercise is known to release endorphins, those “feel-good” chemicals that boost your mood and reduce stress. Micro workouts can provide a quick mental reset, helping to alleviate anxiety and improve focus. Even a few minutes of movement can elevate your mental well-being and set a positive tone for your day.

# 7. No Equipment Required

Most micro workouts rely on bodyweight exercises, making them accessible to anyone, anywhere. Whether you’re at home, in the office, or traveling, you can perform effective workouts without the need for a gym membership or fancy equipment.

# How to Incorporate Micro Workouts Into Your Routine

Ready to give micro workouts a try? Here are some tips to get started:

* **Identify Opportunities for Movement**: Look for small windows of time in your day, such as your morning routine, lunch break, or downtime in the evening. Use these moments to fit in a quick workout.
* **Focus on Compound Movements**: Choose exercises that engage multiple muscle groups, such as squats, push-ups, or mountain climbers. These moves maximize your effort and deliver full-body benefits.
* **Use HIIT Principles**: Incorporate intervals of high-intensity activity followed by short rest periods. For example, do 20 seconds of jumping jacks, rest for 10 seconds, and repeat for 5 minutes.
* **Set Realistic Goals**: Start with just one or two micro workouts a day and gradually increase as you build confidence. Consistency is key, so aim for achievable goals that fit your lifestyle.
* **Make It Fun**: Keep your workouts enjoyable by mixing up exercises, trying new routines, or incorporating music. When you look forward to your workouts, you’re more likely to stick with them.

# Micro Workouts: A Solution for All Lifestyles

One of the best things about micro workouts is their versatility. They’re perfect for beginners easing into fitness, parents juggling family responsibilities, professionals with hectic schedules, or athletes looking to supplement their training. No matter your fitness level or goals, micro workouts can be tailored to meet your needs.

# Conclusion: Small Steps, Big Impact

Micro workouts prove that fitness doesn’t have to be complicated or time-consuming. By focusing on short, intense bursts of activity, you can improve your health, boost your mood, and achieve lasting results without disrupting your daily routine.

Ready to take the first step toward a healthier, more active lifestyle? Start small, stay consistent, and watch as those short sessions add up to big changes. As the saying goes, “It’s not about having time, it’s about making time.” With micro workouts, you can make every minute count.

I was a college athlete and still run/lift multiple times a week. I’m in pretty good shape. I track my calories, and have been training for a hyrox (CrossFit type race) this year. I’d drink a coldbrew and then have a few diet cokes at night. Bloodwork 2-4 times a year. No health problems.

Two weeks ago on a normal Sunday night, I had a panic or anxiety attack. I had never experienced that before and it was scary. I reduced thc and caffeine usage and was feeling a little better everyday. A week after the first one, I had ANOTHER attack. Not as bad since I’d already been through the first one, but now I was worried. Got checked out by my doctor and my heart was great on the EKG resting hr of 46-48 bpm. 

I tried a coffee and it made my day horrible of anxiety. Same with thc immediate regretted it. So now today is day 4 of no caffeine, thc, or Diet Coke. Life is teetering on pointless lol. But seriously my anxiety has been something now I have to manage through deep breathing and praying like I feel terrible. I’m just hoping all this goes away after a few more days.

The book was from the 1980s or 1990s, I read it in early 00s. 

It was about a girl around the age 10-13

She has a boy best friend and they used to hang out in an alley or a fenced in area something like that. 

She had a penpal she wrote to, and lied to the penpal saying her best friend died. Her penpals mom sent the best friends mom flowers and the main character was embarrassed.

I think she was running for class president or something of the sort. She had a hard time being friends with other girls 

There was a scene in the book where she was at a birthday party of a classmate she wasn't good friends with I think. I remember her being at the girls house and reached for a handful of nuts from the bowl in the coffee table. 

There was another part of the book where she borrowed her sister's nail polish, I think it was blue. 

I am 99% sure it's  not a book by Johanna Hurwitz

The cover had a group of students standing in a classroom talking/laughing together. The girls were dressed in skirts/tights or a dress with ballet flats, they were all clean cut. Clearly a dated cover

Young women now no longer need to rely on men for finance and homeownership and in just 2 generations women got better at it than they did. I just want to say. I am glad I have been on women's side from the beginning. Almost all of the violence, harassment and bullying I have faced for being genderqueer had been from boys and men. Men are more likely to kill themselves usually because they either can't feel like a real man if they can't make women ""submit"" to them or because he has had his soul broken for being gender non-conforming, women and girls have always accepted and celebrated me. I never understood men's compulsion to always assert dominance and get this sleezy satisfaction out of having authority over women. I love authority from women. There's less discrimination, more co-operative teamwork because there's less battle for dominance of the discussion. [Women also have better leadership qualities than men](https://www.apa.org/topics/women-girls/female-leaders-make-work-better#:~:text=Decades%20of%20studies%20show%20women,companies%20are%20led%20by%20women)

I love bringing up these points to misogynists every time they say ""Men are better leaders"", ""Women are naturally submissive"", ""Men are more disciplined"" etc.

I'm glad you made it women. Just know that some men are here cheering with you. I hope 30 years from now women are running the show so the economy isn't in shambles, sexual harassment and discrimination will be dealt with properly, the world is safer and fairer for queer people, abortion is legal and men will be going around making their female workers coffees like secretaries in the 60's used to 😂",2,1737774559.0,RadicalFeminism,0,0.75,False

I have hashimoto’s but my TSH is fine so technically everything is fine. Currently taking pantoprazole inconsistently for acid reflux and heart burn problems.

For the last 4 ish months i’ve been having bizarre episodes of heart abnormalities. I just want to say that I have seen a cardiologist and she says she is not concerned, and we are waiting until an upcoming wedding passes to fit me with a heart monitor (so it won’t ruin pictures; she seems very unconcerned and in no rush). I’ve been having these weird episodes of my heart absolutely racing and me feeling very, very fatigued from it. I basically have two different things happening: the feeling of my heart fluttering (especially when bending down) or my heart beating abnormally fast. 

Now, this is extremely inconsistent and episodic. I wouldn’t say I feel dizzy or faint, but it’s like my whole body feels unwell. I get this feeling of unease like something is seriously wrong and I just want to sit down or lie down. I have largely cut out coffee from my life though i was only having 1-2 cups a day max before this started happening and I’ve been drinking coffee for years wirh no problem. 

I have started waking up occasionally with the worst feeling where my heart is just about pounding out of my chest, so much so that I can feel it through my whole body and can practically hear my heart beat. I wake up boiling hot, no sweat though,  pounding and racing heart, and unbelievably nauseous. When I take my pulse, it’s around 110-120 and normal for me is about 80-85. I just feel awful when this happens.

My family has a significant history of heart issues like afib and heart disease so it worries me that this is happening. I have an echo scheduled but it’s about 3 months out and like I said the monitor will start in about a month. also just want to say that I trust my doctor and i do think that it’s fair to not be concerned since i’m not passing out or dizzy, but i just had another episode and it is the worst feeling when it’s happening. thoughts?",1,1737774509.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

1i9dkph,https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1i9dkph/ff06b5_my_way_welcome_im_new/,"FF06B5 ""My way"" Welcome, I'm new ;]","Hello to all FF:06:B5 detectives. I'm new here.  
(I wrote everything in Polish and used ChatGPT  to translate it, so please be forgiving if something is mistranslated.)

I got into this mystery about half a year ago, and I've been reading and following your threads with great pleasure. Amazing work. You are *breathtaking*! But I'd like to share my private investigation...

# 1) It can't be too complicated

Paweł Sasko explained it to a colleague, and she smiled and said it was... clever. If we take all the theories from this forum, Paweł would need days to explain everything to her. I suspect it was a quick coffee conversation, meaning the whole mystery is very simple.

# 2) Am I the only one who noticed this?

Skipping time by 4 hours takes longer than any other interval. When skipping 2, 3, 6, 10, or 12 hours, the game loads instantly. But skipping 4 hours causes a noticeable pause. Either the game is loading additional elements, or it's giving us a clear sign. I play on Xbox, so I asked my friends to check on PC to rule out a technical issue. It’s not. Skipping 4 hours always causes a longer pause. (Skipping *06* times by 4 hours brings you back to the starting time.) (FF — we’ll return to this.)

# 3) The meditating monks

The monks seem to clearly point us toward time manipulation in the game. In *The Witcher*, this was... meditation! (hence the monks). In *Cyberpunk*, it’s “Fast Forward” (FF). This seems like a clear hint that solving the mystery requires time manipulation. Especially since the Ouroboros snake from *The Witcher* is a clear reference to the wheel of time.

# 4) Magenta

The magenta color connected to the FF:06:B5 code seems more like a guiding clue. After all, the color magenta is *FF:00:FF*. I think RED uses this as a way to hint at the puzzle but not as the central element. For example, the magenta lamp by the laptop at the landfill—it’s a hint but not the answer. The code is something deeper, possibly an abbreviation hidden within the color. This belief is reinforced by the email from the church discussing magenta versus fuchsia.

# 5) “B5” could mean “V”

Has anyone else noticed that the “5” in “B5” could be a Roman numeral? That would make it “V,” and the last part of the code could translate to “Be V,” “Back V,” or “Born V.” (more on this later).

# 6) Born V

There’s a special location on the map where V was “born.” The landfill is large, but there’s a “side path” (mentioned by Tyromanta) with a lot of magenta cubes. That’s where V was “born.” Specifically, at 4:40 AM in the story. Considering the animation with the cube in the desert, where phrases like “No Future,” “Trust No One,” and “Turn Back” flash by, this describes the three starting paths—but they all converge at one point. The moment when V dies. And is reborn. And that happens at this location...

# 7) Tyromanta’s path

Following Tyromanta’s path backward, I marked his corpse, his laptop, and extended his travel line to end at the spot where V was “born.” By the way, from the right perspective, the magenta cubes form the letters ...O S. Could this suggest S.O.S.?

# 8) The statue has something underneath

Looking under the map, we can see that the main statue has something at its base. It looks like it could lift up. This seems to be a key to the mystery, considering the graffiti with three figures. Those three figures are holding up the pedestal.

# 9) The church and servers

The mystery with the church and servers isn’t the solution. It appeared later, in a subsequent update. The mattress and entire event feel more like a playful nod from the developers to the players. FF:06:B5 has been there from the beginning. Just a thought for all the YouTube videos claiming “the mystery is solved.” No, it’s not. ;)

# 10) DM + TV

I interpreted the letters “DM + TV” from the labyrinth as “Do Meditation + TV.” After the update, this seems to hint at focusing on the monitor by the monument, where the hexagon appeared. Someone already solved this part. I don’t rule out Delamain’s (DM) involvement in the mystery.

# 11) The vehicles and the monitor

Someone claimed that the vehicle from the update causes the monitor in front of the monument to change. No. Any vehicle changes the monitor to display “Loading Content.” You just need to enter any vehicle for the monitor to change. It’s another clue.

# 12) The Photo Mode

I wouldn’t rule out Photo Mode as part of the solution. Paweł mentioned that it wouldn’t be a standard approach. According to Chinese/Japanese legends, the statue is holding a sword, a sphere, and has an outstretched hand suggesting a mirror. In this game, the mirror is the Photo Mode.

# 13) 4AM

Remember the *Cyberpunk* promotional song, “4AM”? The mattress event happens after 4:00. V’s birth happens at 4:40. It might all be connected.

# Conclusion:

Considering the Ouroboros snake, interpreting FF as “Fast Forward,” and the odd “pause” when skipping time by 4 hours, I interpret FF:06:B5 as time manipulation (Fast Forward); skipping 6 times (4 hours each, where the game “suggests something”); and B5 as the landfill (“Born V”) or something near the monument.

I hope this helps! ;)",7,1737774333.0,FF06B5,1,0.89,False

I don't think we will fall out but I feel like im going to lose my best friend eventually after having a baby and that's quite sad.

I'm going to preface this by saying my friend has autism and doesn't always pick up on social cues. This kinda add context to her behaviour and why I'm blunt with her because she's not going to pick up on it if I'm subtle.

So I'll admit our friendship has always been a little one sided due to her social anxiety so 99% of the time when we meet I have to go to her house. I don't drive so this is a fair journey on public transport. Days after giving birth she was asking me to come over and expecting me to get on a bus with my newborn to see her. I said no for obvious reasons (the reason I didn't tell her was because her house is always unsanitary unclean with dog mess and her dogs bite.)  Eventually she did come over about a month later but she didn't even say hello to my LO. Fast forward a month  we've talked a bit over messenger in the time being but every time bsby is mentioned she chsnges the topic to speak about herself; for example she asks me how I am and I say im pretty OK but tired as LO didn't go to sleep until 3am. She replied ""well on the bright side I got a new pair of trousers"".

Now tomorrow I'm having my first day out without baby and I ask if she wants to meet for coffee. She says yes but she wants to meet earlier. I explain that I cannot do  any earlier as I'll be doing LOs morning routine and getting him ready to go out with his dad. She replies that she can only get a lift early and she doesn't want to take the bus so she will come to my house and wait. Heres where I was blunt and said ""no, because im going to be rushing around trying to get me and LO ready and having a guest to entertain will just make that more stressful and time consuming. Now she's annoyed at me because she will ""have to wait in the coffee shop by herself""

I'm thinking of bringing all this up to her tomorrow's but I'm still figuring out how to word it in my head. 

I'm also considering going to a mum and baby group in the hopes of making friends there and just having some people who understand and being able to celebrate milestones together as well as talk through some of the more challenging parts of parenthood (SLEEP)",1,1737774326.0,newborns,3,1.0,False

You check multiplay and there is not much options, besides Russians and Asians, (no offence towards them I just don't share common language with them.)

All I want is to experience this game with good company and cup of coffee, but I never get past the Wilderness because that's where every host always stops playing. Sure I tried hosting game myself and before I knew everyone were running different directions in different world areas while I'm like, hello again Alfira.

1i9dfu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1i9dfu4/afraid_this_wont_get_better/,Afraid this won’t get better,"I (47 HLF) have been married for almost 23 years to my husband (65LLM). We have been a couple for 28. Please refrain from commenting about the age difference. We have a 15 year old son, and we all get along well.

His libido has always been lower than mine but it just finally died about 10 years ago. We have been to marriage counseling about this three times. Things would get better for a couple of months and then slide back to where we started. 

I’ve been in therapy for various reasons but this has been discussed many times. I really meant my vows but also never expected something like this would happen. He refused to say he lost interest. There was always an excuse. Finally I said it seemed he had completely lost interest but I was going to stay. 

After talking to my therapist I struck a deal with him to keep our relationship from being like roommates. I wanted the occasional $3 flowers from the grocery store, unrequested iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts and he was to initiate date nights. He was supposed to plan them too but that went out the window.

We haven’t been on a date in at least two months if not three. We don’t have to worry about babysitters anymore. It’s feeling very roommate-y. He retires in less than two years and we really have nothing in common than our son. I told him I’m really concerned about our marriage once our son leaves for college and I wanted his help thinking about a hobby we could  share. I told him that at this time I would be happy with just having a tv show we watch together. He had no ideas. We discovered we could watch Spin City on one of our streaming channels. We watched three episodes one night. I kept bringing it up, and he never wanted to watch it. 

It sounds dumb, but I became enraged after I found a series on Netflix with actors we like produced by the same person who produced another series we loved. It had been started and i thought maybe I had started. He walked in the bedroom and said, “Oh, I heard that was good.” After pretty much begging him to find something to do with me, he saw this and never thought to say anything about it to me. 

I told him later on that he hadn’t planned a date in some time and his response was, “Oh, I’m supposed to do that?” Enter the rage. I told him that had been part of the arrangement since we don’t have sex and the purpose was to keep us from being roommates.

I don’t think he’s going to change. I think when our son goes to college he believes we will just remain in our own personal bubbles. I told him that, and why I came to that conclusion and that that’s not what I signed up for. NOW we have a day off and a place to go. I am pretty sure we will go another long period of time without a date afterwards, and the only reason we might have another is if I plan it or mentioned it. I really don’t think he’s is going to change. 

He is otherwise a good husband and father. It’s just that there are many things I would give up in order to have sex again. I was a “good girl” and he’s practically the only person I’ve been with. I was told I’d have a wonderful intimate relationship with the person i chose and that’s proved wrong. I have rage about parting with something really, really important to me without my choice. I have rage about his failure to hold up to the agreement we made. I have absolutely zero attraction to him. I feel like I’m watching my marriage fail in slow motion, and I have tried so, so hard to keep that from happening. I meant my vows or I would’ve left once it became clear that our sex life was over. I came close.

I don’t know how I can take but when I start shopping apartments online it hits me how differently life will be. Maybe a separation under two roofs would help. I don’t know but I’m tired of being treated like I need to keep trudging.and suck it up, and I’m not sure how much longer I can do this.",3,1737773910.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

At the time, my “best friend” (yt woman) lived here as well as other people I was close with. Long story short, I decided to remove myself from the friendship because her whiteness was so white that it was blinding her from her privilege. While reflecting on the friendship i realized that most relationships I had with YT women were, well, unpleasant. After talking through those experiences with my therapist, I decided to actively pursue friendships with other black women. I joined clubs and events dedicated to black girls/POCs. And then one day I walked into my  coffee shop and not only was there a black girl at the front desk, she complimented my curl pattern (it was 1 day our fron wash day and my curls were bussin tbh) and after sharing my number for rewards points, it turned out that we both grew up in the same city. I gave her my number, awkwardly explained that I was making an effort to make blk girl friends so she could reach out if she wanted. 
After hanging out several times, and texting often, she told me she was bi and also made some weird comments…. She makes references to how she’s attracted to me, she asked me directly if my intention in giving her my number was to pursue a romantic relationship (it was not, and i was very clear about that). She makes unwarranted remarks about her sexual preferences and desires (IT WAS FUCKING BIZARRE!!!!!!!!!!!!), she finds opportunities to make comments about being in a relationship with me. Also it’s clear to me that homegirl really centers around romantic relationships so anytime she has expressed attraction for someone, it’s like a romcom (“our hands touched and i felt a spark”….like girl plz) And bruh, the length of her hugs is jusssssssssssssssssssst a lot. It’s making me so uncomfortable that I don’t want to talk to talk to her… also, she follows my sister on ig who she has NEVER MET and i have not even met her bff/1st cousin WHO SHE LIVES WITH!!!!!!

Pazta in Tai Kwun,"We came here for happy hour drinks as a group of six and were given the happy hour menu. I ordered a mocktail from the menu, priced at $48, while others ordered wine, two Aperol Spritz cocktails, and a coffee. When the bill came, I noticed my mocktail was listed as $78—$30 more than the menu price. I questioned the waiter, a European (Italian I believe, who also has been mentioned in other reviews) gentleman, and without hesitation, he claimed the $78 was for the two Aperol Spritz. Thinking I might have misunderstood, I let it go.

After paying, I checked the receipt again and saw I was right—the mocktail was indeed charged at $78. My brother approached the waiter to address the issue, and his response was unbelievably dismissive. He didn’t say a word, handed my brother a $20 bill (not even the full overcharge amount), and walked off.

It’s not about the $30—it’s the principle. We were well within happy hour times, as proven by the correct pricing of the other drinks, but this slimy waiter blatantly overcharged us and acted annoyed when caught. How much of an underachiever in life do you have to be to stoop so low as to scam customers of $30 here and there? This isn’t just a mistake; it’s a deliberate, pathetic attempt to take advantage of people.

Avoid this place at all costs. It would be such a nice place as the atmosphere amazing given its location, however having this waiter working there who’s clearly resorting to scamming customers because he can’t succeed at anything else.

I use them to sign checks, address  envelopes, fill out questionnaires and documents, take to meetings to take notes, and other mundane tasks.   

The pens are just cheap Bic pens from CVS or Staples, and free pens from local businesses.  Not a single one has ever lasted long enough to use up even half the ink in its cartridge before it just stops writing.

The web is saturated with advice about what causes these freeze-ups and countless DIY solutions involving heat, alcohol, WD-40, gravity, special writing surfaces, and many others.  I've tried a few and none of them provide more than temporary respite.

So **My Question** is are there any brands or models of conventional ball point pens that will reliably NOT fail after sitting around for awhile?

**Memory Transcript Subject: Veski, world’s worst friend**

*Date \[Human standard time\]: October 15th, 2136*



Damn him.  Quilk and his stiff, artificial, *appeasing* little postures.  Jalsung was doing the talking as usual but it felt like the words didn't matter at all.  He just nodded along and placated us.

It's as though he's already heard this report several times before, like he already knew what we were going to say, and that he's already made a decision.  Jalsung rambling on about how we still weren't able to find anything feels like it's just a formality at this point.

After she finishes, Quilk reassures us of the importance of our assignment.  Several more \[minutes\] are wasted on a boring rant about “staying alert” and “staying true to our oath”.

I choke down the urge to argue that our ‘oath’ has nothing to do with terrorizing and stalking innocent people.

Not that he'd listen.

The meeting ends right after he finishes his motivational speech.  We couldn't leave fast enough.

Usually, as we wander down the warm halls me and Jalsung would make fun of Quilk.  Laugh it all off with lighthearted banter.  But this time, something was different. 

The walls were adorned with brightly colored banners and decorations.  Booze was already being piled high in the conference room.  All I could hear was talk of genocide laced with bubbly joy.  It made me nauseous.  The old and well worn sash around my body felt filthy.

And off at the hobby shop was a friend.  Someone who was fighting just to survive.  They didn't even need to compromise on themselves to do it.  Yet, they were going to spend the next few nights alone, waiting for their whole world to burn.

“I'm a bad friend.”

“What?!  What are you talking about?”  Jalsung shouted.

I hadn't even realised that thought escaped my mouth.

“Liam tried to make friends with us and I made a mess of the night.”

Jalsung winces at the mention of his name.  She waits until we step outside before responding.

“Look, you are totally fine.”

“I embarrassed him.”

“Oh stop worrying about it!  You embarrassed yourself just as much.”

I throw my head back and groan.

“Oh, would you just listen to me?  You've been like this since last night!  Liam doesn't hate you, if anything, I think that all the bloom in his ears made it clear that he might have felt the same way.”

Could he really?

I sigh.  “Might?”

“Don't tell me that you of all people are going to be fussing like this.”

So she admits to there being a possibility that I've messed everything up.  Jalsung may be happy just brushing everything off but I do not wish to be a burden on one of the only people to have so readily accepted me.

“I want to make things right.”

“Ugh, you are being a total pup!  I - fine.  Just let me handle it at least because there's no way I'm letting you ruin this for yourself.”

**Memory Transcript Subject: Liam Wahlberg, Hobby Shop Owner**

*Date \[Human standard time\]: October 15th, 2136*



It’s hard to explain how strange the exterminator’s behavior feels.  The very moment I step too far from the shop those silver suits descend on me like hawks.  Yet, while I’m here, they refuse to get anywhere close.

As I scrub the latest of the anti-human graffiti off of the front window, ironically made with an eclectic set of paints right from my own shelves, I can see glimpses of those pyromaniacs wandering in and out of buildings and alleyways all glaring at me.

It could be worse I guess.  I could be back on earth.

Even the most hopeful reports of the battles feel so hopeless.  It all reminds me of old war stories from before the internet where folks realised that their country was losing as reports of battlefield ‘victories’ kept creeping closer and closer to home.

My thoughts about the fleet, the exterminators here, and whatever happened last night all mixed together like beer and liquor.  I woke up way too late this morning and despite it being mid day I still feel like I just fell out of bed.  At least the chill from stepping outside is serving to wake me up a little.

Still, with a rough night of sleep and far too much stress, I didn’t have the energy to engage with more than I needed to.  I got to work with my earbuds playing some classic rock loud enough to blot out any other stimuli from the outside world.

I was somewhere near the end of scrubbing off the last of the slurs when I felt a gentle tap on my back.   As carefully as I could, I plucked one of the earbuds out of my ear and turned around.

An anxious looking zurulian and what I presumed to be their child stood just behind me.  

“S-sorry to disturb you.  I just wanted to know if you were open today?”

“Oh yeah, I was planning on opening up after I got this all cleaned up but I can just let yall in now.”

“T-thank -”

The little kid rather abruptly interrupted with, “Are you the rat man?”

Despite how appalled the parent was, I couldn’t help but chuckle.

“Fenn!”

“What?  You said we were going to visit the rat man if I ate all my dinner!”

I place the brush into the bucket and lean down so I tower over the two a little less.

“Ah you got me kid.  Anything I can help you with?”

Out of the corner of my eye I could see some exterminators tighten their grips on their flamethrowers and a few cameras come out.  Either unfazed or unaware the kid’s eyes light up.

“Momma told me about the nasty predators called rats that your friends were fighting!”

The poor mother flinched visibly.  I’m not sure if my laugh made her feel any better or worse.

“Fenn, please, be polite.”

“But I want to know what happened next!”

“Well we need to let the nice man let us inside first, and once you ask his name *then* you can ask questions.  I-If that’s alright with you?”

“Of course.  Give me a minute after I unlock the door so I can finish cleaning up and then I’ll be back to answer all of little Fenn’s questions.”

As soon as I opened the door the little kid tore off and started running between the isles and poking at anything of even the most mild of interest.  The mother rushed after the little hellion looking completely frazzled.  

A few minutes later the window was nice and shiny again.  As I was rinsing out the bucket at the spigot around the back of the building Veski and Jalsung turned the corner.  They seemed to be having a very animated conversation until they spotted me.  

Veski started marching directly for me, completely ignoring Jalsung as she gave one last desperate tug on the big girl’s arm.

“Oh, hey Ves -”

“I am apologizing for yesterday.”

“That, uh - ah, no worries, really.”

“No, I behaved inappropriately and suggested things about our relationship that aren’t true.”

“Oh?”

That stung a bit more than I really anticipated.  Hell, I barely even processed what all even happened.  Off on the street Jalsung slaps her own face with both paws.

Veski immediately tensed up as her ears started to blush slightly.

“I-I mean I like you as a good friend and I want to keep eating your weird milk food.  Well, weird isn’t the right word because it was really good.  I just don’t want to eat from the same plate where we touch like that.  Not that touching you is bad I just -”

I place my hands on her shoulders and give a gentle shake.

“It’s ok Veski.  I get it, we’re friends.”

While I’ve gotten pretty good with zurulian body language, something shifts in her that I can’t quite place.  Still, she clearly signals that she’s calming down.

“Good, I was worried I upset you.”

“Oh you’re fine.  I’d love to have you over again some time soon.”

That weird stiffness that held Veski for a brief moment disappeared just as quickly as it came.  She rolled her shoulders and settled back into her stern but eager self.

“That would be nice.”

With that, she turned heel and wandered right into the store with a very miserable Jalsung right behind her.

I still wasn’t sure what these two’s obsession with my store was.  They didn’t buy much, that’s for sure.  They just seemed to wander around, look at things, drink a bunch of whatever tea they got from across the street, and chat with anyone and everyone that came in.  In some way they almost started to feel like a feature of the place alongside Obour whenever he decided to roll around.

I wonder if that’s just normal with these aliens?  They just pick places or people they like and make themselves at home.  Maybe it has something to do with their herding tendencies?  It’d make sense considering how well acquainted I’m starting to become with my regulars and how the folks just across the street seem to have made a very persistent neighborhood watch.

Maybe there’s something I could be doing better with the store to make it more amiable to letting people stick around longer?  Really, it’s only now that I am starting to realise how fast paced most human stores are and how hard our places make it to just … linger.

These thoughts and several other disjointed ones float around in my head for the rest of the work day as I wander back inside to finish setting up the store.  They do their best to keep me in a blind stupor and to some degree, they’re successful.

I entertained the Fenn kid for a bit with a dramatic retelling of the battle for the Stillwater Inn and despite the fact that the mother presented the whole thing as being for her child, she really seemed to get invested in the story herself.

At some point Sysill snuck in and got to work.  I only realised he was here once I saw the moody pincushion open the door and find his own private corner to stuff himself into.  

Customers came and went.  Some more excitedly and comfortably than others.  One or two seemingly a little *too* much so.

The last of our intrepid party members came in later in the evening, which was still only a few hours into my shift.

I hadn't realised how much of a stupor I'd been in until both of the spider kids marched right up to me with Sysill in tow.  Halsk was leading the pack and when I paused to take out my headphones.  She puffed out her chest and straightened her antenna in an odd but cute attempt at looking commanding.

“You are going to bed.  This instant!”

“Wha…?”

It was only when I fully turned to face the group that I saw Sysill carrying a small bundle of pill bottles and some alien herbs I haven't seen before.  He says,

“We've all noticed that you're unwell.”

Nahlin gestures back to Sysil before speaking,

“Even some customers noticed.  A couple people came back with medicines because they were so worried about you!”

Halsk stomps one of her many legs down.

“Precisely!  It has already been elected.  You are discharged for the rest of the night so you may rest.”

“Woah woah, hold on.  Thank you for looking out for me but I'm fine enough to -”

Halsk tuts and crosses her arms.

“You are unable to deceive me Liam!  I have done my research on humans and have learned about your people's tendency to hide signs of injury or weakness.  However, you are clearly lethargic and unwell.”

I scanned the room and it seemed like everyone was backing these three up.  It honestly felt like some sort of intervention with how they all subtly cornered me in with soft, caring, and morose stares.  

“OK, fine.  I guess you're right.  I probably do need a break.  Just let me know when you and Sysill are about to clock out so I -”

“Ah-Ah!  Nonsense!  Do not worry about closing.  We will handle it.”

“What?  No, I won't make you close up shop alone.”

Sysill sheepishly mutters,

“I-I was gonna help close…”

I pause a moment just to do some quick mental math.

“You'd be working a 5 hour shift just to make it to closing time.  It'd take even longer to clean and lock up the store!”

“I know.  It's just… You've been nice to me.  I-I want to help.”

Nahlin steps forward and places a hand on Halsk's shoulder.

“And the rest of us are here to help as well.  There's nothing you need to worry about.”

I give one last look around the room before accepting defeat.

“Oh alright.  You all have clearly thought this out.  I trust you.”

I'd barely gotten the words out before the others start ushering me off to the apartment staircase.

“But you guys can still knock on my door if you need anything-”

Nahlin interrupts, “No worries, we have everything under control!”

“And there's coffee in the mini-kitchen if-”

Obour sighs, rolls off of his stool, and begins physically shoving me up the stairs.

“Look, we got it.  Go get some sleep.  I'm sure the herd's eager to play some more of that game of yours tonight so we'll need you alert and well by then.  Now. Just. Get-”

And with that I was all but thrown into the apartment, the door quickly slamming shut behind me.

…

I guess I've got the day off?

Slowly stripping,  
Day by day,  
Becoming a shell of my own former self.  
My heart feels hollow  
And my body is cold,  
Struggling to find the capability to move the corpse I inhabit.

I cry,  
Alone,  
Simply alone,  
And I find it beyond hard to be okay  
With the layout of my life.  
The men I've sought comfort in,  
Only one as sweet as song.  
Though he is nothing more than a stranger.  
Yet, I admit,  
I crave him.  
Not the man  
But the perspective he lives by,  
The opinions he holds,  
The way he makes his coffee  
Or what jokes he laughs at most.

I want to connect with a soul I can learn of,  
Learn from,  
And love for the way he loves me.  
I want to love without consequence,  
Or terror,  
Or sour thoughts,  
At least a love where the violence is valid and shared  
And understood.  
A love where I spend every day  
Thinking through the thoughts of the person I've come to know,  
The things that he may like,  
Or enjoy,  
Or be scared of.  
Understanding the mind,  
Not just the heart.

I want love I can be,  
Not be a part of.  
I want understanding and connections;  
Two as one,  
Not side by side,  
But a collective,  
Something I can be confident in,  
And love with no fear.  
Just Love.

I hope this works.

Before I go any further in this story I just wanna a
apologize for doing a repost as I am new to reddit and I heard great things about the app and want to give it a try. I hope I don’t make grammatical errors in this post. If I did, I am sorry!


For Context, my Mum’s side of the family is poor, they live in a province in the Philippines. My Grandparents always finish their bank accounts and can’t save like their life depends on it. Thus why they told my Mum and her Brother to study hard and earn a good job with a high salary so that they can get somewhere in life. While my Mum studied hard my Uncle was partying and having girlfriends and one day he got someone pregnant who came from a well off family and they were forced to marry.

Also at that time my Grandparents were losing their house because they failed to pay it on time because they retired early. During this time my Mum finished college and became an accountant and bought the house and paid for my Grandparents basic maintenance and necessities at their new house due to parental expectations to take care of the family (this will be important later.) My Uncle was encouraged to study but my Grandfather's influence made my Uncle a taxi driver (bad idea).
He was dependent on my Grandparents and my Mum, and at some point my Uncle was coddled by my Grandparents ( the type where they believed their son did nothing wrong and can’t say no to the son afraid that he would be hurt.) So to help the family my Mum went to Dubai where eventually she met my Dad who is the same age as my Mum’s Brother and soon enough they got married and had me. Since my Uncle had nowhere to go he lived in my Mum’s house which she bought and slowly paid her loan which her Brother did not contribute a single penny despite my Mum not living there and still helping her Brother while also having her own family.

At this point in time my Aunt has 2 kids and one on the way (who by the way is the same age as me.) To help her Brother my Mum tried to help him get a job but in less than a week he left due to homesickness (I understand it’s normal to get homesickness but at the end of the day it is for the family you have created.)
Eventually My Aunt has 4 children, 3 female and 1 male, for some reason after everything they always ask my Mum for money whether that would be big or bigger even though my Aunt can borrow money from her siblings who are filthy rich than my Mum and they  would probably think it’s pennies to them. My narcissistic “Aunt” wanted her kids not to know that the house was paid by Mum and have been funding everything to keep alive and to top it all off with my Grandparents big ego they made the kids think it was a gift to them even though my Mum bought the house and it wasn’t in their name and her Brother knew that his Parents would not say no to him cause they are scared and when my Mum confronted her Grandparents they said it was an “inheritance”. At this time My Mum and I had to move to Australia for my education, because in Dubai to go to University is more expensive than going to high school. People who immigrated to a country know that it is a struggle, but my Aunt and Uncle believed that my Mum was making lots of money including my Grandparents but that has now changed and to this day they still think that. 
I remember my Mum’s constant stress and breakdowns and the late night phone calls 
at night and it wasn’t hard to figure out what it was about, but I am glad that my Dad had money to support me and my Mum, so she wouldn’t have to worry about me.

Whenever I go to the Philippines, my cousins are cold and distant towards me only saying basic things like ’hi’ and ‘hello’ like acquaintances while my extended family actually treats me like family. And whenever we come they know that we would be giving expensive things like coffee or nutella because it was expensive and we always give it to my Grandparents because they like it but they always take it from them and my Grandparents have no choice but to say yes, on certain occasions they will be like asking my Uncle to ask my Mum to buy certain things like food claiming it was for me but they always say ‘Sorry I forgot to give you a piece, maybe next time.’ (yk literal pigs)


Now to the current situation 
Last month we went back to my Mum’s place and man it was crazy, so basically my Mum has this land and their is a small storage space, and down the hill is my Uncle’s piggery business (which my Mum paid for but my Uncle works their while my Mum gets nothing) but in reality it is a house in the middle of her land. She wanted that storage space to be demolished if one day if she were to retire or sell she can remove it. From what I know if it’s there it would decrease in value. My Uncle lives there including his kids (30f), (25f), (16f) and (14m) and a grandchild from the (30f) who is (3f). The problem was that her Grandparents and her Brother did not tell her. And at the end my Dad talked with my Mum about negotiations and explained to my Grandparents about it in which they believed that my Uncle should get everything (stupid) that my Mum has left in which my Dad criticised my Grandparents for not helping my Mum and coddling over a grown man and also my Dad said to my Grandparents that if you like your son so much you should sell and what you have and live off of that (which my Grandparents refused because they don’t know how to save money.)

At the end the agreed with the negotiations that he gets to keep the business and the small house in the condition that they don’t do work on it and will instead get land and also my Grandparents have to give 2 pieces of land to my Mum’s name as she been helping my Grandparents for years and recently. has been paying for my Grandfather's injections which are really pricy. 
The thing was it was going well and my Uncle agreed to those terms but when he told my Aunt she considered it as a threat and told the kids about how my Mum is selfish and greedy and they are going to take their house, the storage house, the business and stop taking care of my Grandparents (which was absurd as they already got my Mum’s house already in their name and even though she doesn’t like her parents choices she still loves them) but either way her Brother followed in her words.

When they heard the news they believed a lie that 
my “Aunt” has said but my oldest cousin was hit the hardest. She is like my Uncle but except that she studied and could have had the same potential as my Mum but ended up getting pregnant early and now is married and has a child (3f). The problem with her is that she did not leave her parents house because she refused to live with her husband’s Mom (if you're curious about his occupation he is a seaman so he is never around). After she started posting things like “Nothing compares to the joy of a family that gathers, where the only goal is to lift each other up and see everyone succeed. No room for envy, only support.” Which was supposed to tell my Mum that she wasn’t helping the family even though they don’t know the truth, now their family hates us and My Aunt, Uncle and Older cousin are bashing my family and saying bad things about us and is wanting the worst things to happen to my Mum to the point where that she refused to look at her social media account. Now my Parents agreed that they won’t get anything from them, including land. The worst part was that my Grandparents saw the whole thing and did not confess what had happened all these years to them. 

Right now my Mum hasn’t commented or made a post about it and chose to stay quiet. However my Mum‘s perspective has changed about my Older cousin that she once knew, the same person who my Mum has seen growing up and took care of her when she needed treatment that her OWN parents can’t even afford. This new Older cousin is now living as an adult in a teenager body who tries to badmouth, yell and create a scene and is not acting like a Mother to her obese child who needs proper exercise not being overfed by eating junk food (yes she is a donut mom.)

I want my Mum to be ok, I want to cut them off but at the same time my Mum believes that it could divide the extended family and possibly destroy the whole family. I want to tell my cousins the truth but their Mom would brainwash them in which my Parents have calculated that it is only up to my Grandparents to tell the truth but they are so prideful and ashamed at the same time that they couldn’t afford the house that they once had lived in.

So I am asking on reddit to give me advice on how to deal with the situation. My Mum is not a confrontational type of person but I would like some advice on which I can share to her so that she could consider.
I will try my best to give and update and answer questions.

This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe; I substituted an egg for the other half if the oil for the first time and I think it was an improvement. The original recipe calls for 1c of oil and no egg. 

Original recipe: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8396/chocolate-oil-cake/?print

My recipe:

Ingredients
3c flour
2c white sugar
3/4c cocoa powder 
1/2t salt
2t baking soda
1c olive oil or melted, unsalted butter (or 1/2c oil and 1 egg)
2t vanilla extract
2c coffee or warm water
2T white vinegar

Method
Preheat oven to 350F, grease Bundt pan. (Can be baked in any shape pan; simply adjust cooking temp and/or time as needed.)
1. Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, salt, and baking soda in large bowl. 
2. Measure 2c of coffee/warm water (I use Cafe Bustelo instant). Add vanilla and vinegar to coffee.
3. Make a well in dry ingredients. Add oil, and egg, if using. Whisk slightly with a fork to break yolk/combine.
4. Pour in coffee mixture and incorporate dry ingredients gradually with a wooden spoon or spatula. Let batter stand 5 min for soda/vinegar reaction.
5. Pour into prepared pan. 

Bake 40 min or until knife comes out clean. Cool 10-20 min and then invert onto plate. 

** You can make this in a stand mixer too; I would just dump in all the ingredients like Mary Berry and mix until smooth.

What’s worse is that I am a married man with 2 young kids. Because of my limerence, I rarely think of my wife in an affectionate way; however I will say that we have been dealing with marital problems for the past 3 years.

Chapter 1: The Creation of the Brew

1. In the beginning, there was darkness over the waters of the kettle, and James Hoffman spoke: ""Let there be grind,"" and there was grind. And the grind was fine, yet not too fine, lest bitterness would rise.


2. And James saw that the grind was good, and he separated the grounds from the chaff with the great Ritual of WDT, for the grounds must be distributed evenly, that the shot might flow true.


3. And he spoke again: ""Let there be tamping, firm but gentle, that the puck may stand strong against the waters."" Thus the tamper was brought forth, and the grounds were pressed with care.


4. On the second day, James declared: ""Let the waters flow at nine bars of pressure, no more and no less, that the elixir of life might descend."" And lo, the water met the grounds, and there was extraction.


5. And the espresso flowed golden and thick, a stream of crema glistening with promise. And James called it ""God Shot,"" and it was good.

Chapter 2: The Rituals of the Faithful

1. Blessed are those who observe the 1:2 ratio, for they shall inherit balance. For every gram of coffee, let there flow two grams of espresso, no more and no less, lest the brew fall into sourness or bitterness.


2. And the prophet Matt Perger taught: ""Grind finer, grind finer still, until the extraction sings. But beware, for too fine a grind brings choking, and your machine shall groan under the weight of your hubris.""


3. On the third day, it was commanded: ""Clean thy portafilter and purge thy steam wand, for cleanliness is next to godliness, and stale grounds bring ruin to thy brew.""


4. And the faithful gathered their tools: the scale, the grinder, and the puck screen. They worked with reverence, for the craft was sacred, and the taste was their offering.

Chapter 3: The Trials of the Uninitiated

1. Woe unto the one who tampeth unevenly, for their puck shall crack, and channeling shall plague their shot.


2. And the unfaithful shall say, ""It is too much work,"" but the wise will reply, ""Patience, for the way of espresso is narrow and requires discipline. Seek perfection, and thou shalt be rewarded.""


3. Beware the false prophets who cry, ""Pods are enough,"" for they have forsaken the true craft. Their brew is but a shadow of the divine nectar.

Chapter 4: The Kingdom of Crema

1. On the seventh day, the barista rested, for the espresso was made perfect. The crema was thick, the body full, and the finish sweet like the morning dew.


2. And the faithful gathered around their cups and praised the work of their hands. They shared stories of their struggles with dialing in, yet rejoiced in the triumph of a balanced shot.


3. And James said unto them, ""Go forth and share the gospel of espresso. Teach the world the way of grind, tamp, and ratio. And may your baskets always be full, your pressure stable, and your crema unbroken.""

Recently she came home one afternoon from working at local cafe (and when I say ‘working’ I mean her remote job for sales tech company not actually working as a coffee shop employee)flustered telling me a guy that is a server there and looks at her a lot asked her for her number and she panicked and gave it to him. 

She said she just froze and gave it.
I asked if she was attracted to him she said yes but that didn’t have anything to do with it. She was caught off guard and panicked. 

She said she wasn't interested and would not respond to him and we had a laugh (though my initial reaction was why not just say you have a husband?). She showed me text that came in (him saying hey it’s me from coffee shop) and never responded. 

However every work day since for last month she's been at that cafe from 10am-5pm; she took me off her Lock Screen on phone, l've even noticed once her without her ring.

She recently asked me about threesomes with other men but when I ask if it's the guy from coffee shop she says no just wants to in general. I said maybe I could consider it on an exotic vacation but certainly not someone local. She said she’d want to be able to do it with someone she has rapport with. 

She called me crying the other night (it’s been a month since the first phone number encounter) while I was on work trip saying she just feels bad that the phone number thing happened and can tell I'm Trying to over compensate for it by being extra nice an accommodating like I’m competing. She feels bad and doesn’t want me to feel that way. Loves me; I’m so great. Etc. (totally unsolicited I was working).

I told her why don't you just avoid that coffee shop then; it’s clearly giving us issues and causing problems. Even if it’s totally on up and up - why not just remove yourself from situation all together. Please for me! 

She got a bit defensive at first saying I’m being controlling and nothing is going on but ultimately after some back and forth said okay, you’re right I’ll stop going. 

Turns out the rest of the week including today (when I’m back home) she's been at the coffee shop.

I keep pleading to stop going to coffee shop just so I can feel stable and secure, but she keeps telling me I’m crazy and insane and nothing is going on and I’m being controlling. She even called her mom and had her mom defend her (but by end even her mom said - you know if he really feels this way you should stop going he’s your husband).

Discarded the first 3 cups as mentioned on the manual and followed the James Hoffman video to pre heat the water, use the lowest flame setting on a gas stove and temperature surf the pot. The coffee somehow is too bitter. Even though I love dark roasts, this didn't seem flavorful like a French Press coffee. Is this because this is a pressure based brewing method? Do you guys drink the coffee straight out of the Moka pot or mix a bit of hot water in it to make it something closer to an Americano? If so, what ratio for the coffee you get from the 3 cup Moka pot? Do I go for a Medium Dark roast instead of a Dark roast?

 ### **Loki's Message**
Loki’s playful yet cunning nature often guides us through chaos to clarity. His message might be urging you to stop overextending yourself (2 of Pentacles) and to face your emotions without letting them dominate your decisions (reversed Queen of Swords). He wants you to prepare for a new path where your intellect, honesty, and decisiveness will serve as your strongest tools (Ace of Swords).  

Loki could also be nudging you toward embracing change and challenging old ways of thinking—reminding you to trust your ability to adapt and thrive.

1i9cvko,https://i.redd.it/72n5xlnjw1fe1.png,Intermittent Fasting Dilemma,"Question about fasting.

First for some background. I've been on the carnivore diet for about four and a half months. I eat mostly beef, but all kinds of meat as well as dairy (but I try not to overdo the dairy). I rarely eat fish because I don't like it. I take magnesium fish oil and iodine as supplements, but that's it. 

So I've always been under the impression that intermittent fasting is healthy. I've been doing it for about a year, a year and a half, to help maintain my weight loss (more on that later). I skip breakfast and don't eat my first meal until about noon or so. Before starting carnivore, I would sometimes snack in addition to those two meals. I had a lot of coffee drinks with artificial sweeteners and or creamer and them. I lost about 90 lb (on Weight Watchers) and after maintaining  it for about 2 years, I gained about 30 back.  My food was starting to get out of control again and it scares me. I couldn't say no to sugar. Along with the “healthy” meat and vegetables, I ate a lot of processed “healthier” options, but really junk food. I started carnivore mainly to break my sugar addiction but I was hoping to lose the 30 lb that I had gained and maybe another 5 or 10. (I lost maybe 14lbs and then hit a plateau after about 2 months in.) I also was in a lot of pain prior to starting carnivore (which is now much better) and have a thyroid nodule that I'm hoping to shrink.

So, now for my question. Like I said, I always thought intermittent fasting was healthy so I've continued on with that throughout my carnivore journey, and I was hoping to eventually get down to OMED. My question has to do with hunger. I know with carnivore you're supposed to eat when you're hungry, till satisfied. When I get up in the morning, oftentimes I'm hungry, but I don't eat, trying to stick with the intermittent fasting plan. So I wait till noon or so. I'm definitely hungry again by dinner time and occasionally hungry before bed and I might have a snack of a couple hard boiled eggs, butter, or some yogurt with pork rinds or something like that. So because of my hunger, I have not been able to do OMED like I'd hoped. I'm wondering if I should just go ahead and eat three meals a day and stop trying to do intermittent fasting. Occasionally, instead of intermittent fasting I will have a carnivore coffee as I call it, which is decaf coffee, collagen peptides, cream, and butter, and sometimes MCT oil. (Yes I know that's not carnivore.)

I'd be happy to know your thoughts and opinions on this fasting dilemma, especially if you can back it up scientifically with real facts and tell me why you believe what you believe (or point me in the right direction with a link). Also, if anybody has any specific opinions about MCT oil, why I shouldn't eat it (not just the fact that it isn't carnivore) I like to hear that too.   Thank you so much for your time and patience.

I had a whole rant about Etsy here, but Reddit ate it and now I'm tired lol. Suffice it to say, Etsy has been a nightmare of lockouts and listing takedowns, and they straight up don't have a support department anymore. Just an AI that can't be reasoned with. I've had over a dozen listings removed the instant I post them, and takedowns are permanent with no option to appeal.

**TL;DR: I'm leaving Etsy and building my own website.**

It will take a little time, but I have a background in this, and I'm excited. This is the natural next step. I plan to stay on Etsy but I won't post anything new there after today. Once the website is finished I will move all full sizes over there, leaving the Etsy shop open only for sample sets.

**ALSO:** alcohol perfumes are coming. Much is in the works.

For now, I'm going to focus on making a pretty ass website, testing my formulas in alcohol, and staying in Etsy's good graces. Once I get rid of their hobbles and weights, it's on like Harrison Bergeron. Gonna rewrite that ending though.

We all will. Don't forget that. Nothing's over until we say it is.

1i9cv9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1i9cv9b/intrusive_thoughts_gone_officially_60_days/,Intrusive thoughts gone! Officially 60 days without coffee,"Hello Reddit,

I’m officially 60 days no coffee. Holy shit.

Background on me: I’ve been drinking pop/soda since I was really young—like 5 years old. My parents didn’t think much of it, probably because they grew up drinking it too. By middle school, I was already hooked on iced coffee. In high school, it got worse. I remember one time I drank an entire gallon of mocha-flavored coffee in a day. I barely slept that night—probably 4 hours tops—and spent the whole night playing video games until 5 a.m. The next day? Fell asleep in class, like always.

Looking back, I don’t really blame my parents. They didn’t know any better, and honestly, I didn’t either. But now that I’m 24, I just couldn’t keep living like that. Something had to change. I was having constant panic attacks. Could not sleep. 

Quitting coffee wasn’t easy. At first, I felt like absolute garbage. Headaches, fatigue, irritability—you name it. I thought I was dying. But now, 60 days in, I feel so much better. My anxiety has gone way down. I don’t have those constant fear-based thoughts anymore, and I’m finally sleeping like a normal person.

That said, it’s still hard sometimes. Going out to eat or figuring out what to drink in the morning is a challenge. Water feels boring, and I miss having something flavorful. I’ve been trying out herbal teas and the occasional decaf drink, but it’s not the same.

Ultimately, I feel like my mental health is more important to me at the end of the day. Caffeine should not be consumed every day. It is a stimulate. A drug. It’s not normal or natural to consume heaps of it daily. You are abusing your body and your brain by doing this. It’s not worth it just a drink. You control yourself, not what you consume. It’s never the other way around, and if you’re doing something that makes you feel dependent on it to feel fulfilled, that’s when you know something is wrong. ",16,1737772035.0,decaf,4,1.0,False

These compact devices are designed to perform specific tasks, making cooking and meal preparation quicker and easier. From blending smoothies to toasting bread, small home appliances are essential for every culinary enthusiast.

One of the most popular small home appliances in the kitchen is the blender. Ideal for smoothies, soups, and sauces, blenders come in various sizes and functionalities, catering to everyone from casual users to professional chefs. Another indispensable appliance is the toaster, which can transform your breakfast routine by delivering perfectly browned slices of bread, bagels, or pastries with minimal effort.

For those who enjoy baking, a stand mixer is a must-have small home appliance. They simplify the process of mixing dough or whipping cream and come equipped with various attachments for different culinary tasks. On the other hand, slow cookers and multi-cookers provide an easy way to prepare meals ahead of time, allowing busy individuals to enjoy home-cooked meals without the hassle of constant supervision.

In addition to these essentials, coffee makers have become a staple for many households, enabling users to brew their favorite coffee blends with ease. Moreover, air fryers have gained immense popularity for their ability to create crispy fried foods with less oil, making them a healthier alternative to traditional frying methods.

If you don't mind a noob then we can definitely get our league on. I've been playing a lot of Marvel Rivals too, I only played ranked for one night but solo-climbed to Gold when I did, it'd be fun to push ranked or just quick plays. For WoW, this is my main game and have been playing it forever. I main a shadow priest for Mythics and PvE. I haven't done much in a while in terms of keys but when I did play, I stopped at timing all 9s - so around 2.4k io I believe. I enjoy arena and BGs too if you're more of a PvPer! Classic WoW I'd be down to play if you're more interested in that too, I have a few toons on Nightslayer already. An honorable mention is Valorant (played best when drunk of course). 

I'm a very non-rage/chill type of gamer and don't mind if you're bad or new, though I do find it fun to constantly push myself to get better.

It was really painful to read everything since it reminded me of my FAness and how easy other people have it, but it had to be done. I've tried so many things but still no gf irl so that's why I needed to find more ways. 

**Places/ways:**

Most advice are trash but these are *slightly more* doable than others, with a *slightly better* people/effort ratio or quality/effort ratio. Some of these are quite unusual but I'm putting them here anyways in case all methods fail. 

- Beauty expo
- Library activities
- Art gallery
- Community events
- Group therapy
- Cold approach 300 in 30 days and treat it like your life depends on it 
- Side job
- Connect with prison immates 
- Ask barista for referral 

**Advice that I've discounted:**

These are just generic locations, places with low people/effort ratio, or places I'm not interested in but you may find useful. 

- Book stores
- Bars and clubs
- Classes like painting, cooking, dancing
- Church (funny how so many people became theists suddenly when giving advice)
- Volunteering
- Grocery store
- Coffee shop
- Gym 
- Sports 
- etc.
-  And of course the usual BS love yourself and stop looking you'll meet someone advice 

**FYI, things I've tried personally:**

- Meetups
- Hobby groups and events
- Creating & advertising my own meetup
- Bars and clubs 
- Language exchanges
- Language learning platforms
- Online chat platforms
- Travelling to another city 
- Dating apps
- Asking friends
- Asking a researcher 
- Cold approaches

**Things I might try in the future:**

Other than the advice from those comments,

- Anime/cosplay expo 
- Speed dating
- Move to another country",14,1737771376.0,ForeverAlone,4,0.89,False

Coffee shops are the go-to third place in US cities, but they're no use for someone trying to cut down on coffee. Most don't offer many vegan-friendly drinks coffee. You don't go for a cafe for their tea options. I could opt for decaf but I think that's a slippery slope that would just make my crave normal coffee.

What are some good options similar to a coffee shop but without the coffee? Places where I can chit-chat, maybe see a show or go to events, sit down, etc. Museums and libraries aren't social enough. Tea shops are uncommon.",1,1737771296.0,decaf,3,1.0,False
1i9cn0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1i9cn0i/health_code_violations/,health code violations,"just need to rant for a sec, I've already decided I'm reporting to the health department 

I've been working at this shop for a couple months now and I've noticed a lot of nasty/sketch shit. the biggest thing so far has been the mold in the pastry case. there's a part of our pastry case that's under a metal piece (the customers can't see it and employees can only see it if they lift the metal piece) that is completely filled with mold. all the crumbs from the pastries fall in there and it's clear it hasn't been cleaned in a long time. I was cleaning out the pastry case one day (this isn't done regularly, I'm the only one that's done it since I've started working here, I make sure to clean it out every time I work now). I told my manager about the mold the next day and he just said ""yeah..."" ?? as if he already knew it was in there??? and doesn't care about it ?? well that was 2 months ago and I just checked and the mold is still there. so clearly he doesn't care about it.

multiple employees resteam milk, don't rinse milk pitchers after each use, don't wipe or purge the steam wands, let coffee grounds get into the ice bin, grab pastries with their BARE HANDS instead of using the tongs and hand it to the customer, I've found multiple milk cartons that have mold/are chunky/out of date, they don't wash dishes properly (I've watched one person literally just rinse a blender with water and then put it on the clean rack to dry, no soap no sanitizer), I've seen multiple employees handle food with their bare hands when making the sandwiches (one of which was my manager), I called out another employee for not washing her hands after she used the bathroom. she literally was about to go right back to making drinks after using the bathroom and then got pissed when i told her that's disgusting. I just noticed tonight that there's mold in the bottom of one of the trash cans, like the entire bottom of it is covered in mold from someone's drink spilling on it. our ac/heat also don't work well so it's gotten well into the 80s inside and nothing has been done about it, I'm sure that amount of heat and humidity is great for the food we're serving :/

me and another coworker are the only ones who actually clean anything but it's kinda useless cause it all gets disgusting again when we're off.

it's a shit show and I don't think the owners are gonna do anything about it if I just talk to them so I've decided to report it to the health department. I've been wanting to report it for a while but I'm worried about jeopardizing mine and my coworkers jobs.",2,1737771289.0,barista,3,0.75,False
