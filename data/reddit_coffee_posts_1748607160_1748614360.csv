1kz529g,https://i.redd.it/8sw9us8rex3f1.jpeg,Eastern phoebes warning each other?,"I have a nest of recently-hatched eastern phoebes out my living room window up in the eaves. I first became aware of it because I noticed an eastern phoebe regularly perched on a branch or the side steps rail right outside the window, almost like it was keeping watch, and not long after I saw the mama on the nest. A couple of days later the babies hatched and the parents have been busy flying in and out with food. I've done my best to keep a respectful distance including not using that side door and mostly everyone seems content.

Yesterday I was out on the deck, which is not far from the nest, just around the corner. I hadn't been out there much because we've had a major caterpillar event, so it was kind of gross (lots of food for the hatchlings!). But the caterpillars are ebbing, and so I was cleaning it up. I was making kind of a racket moving things around and I noticed the phoebes started making a ton of noise. I finished up and went inside and let them relax.

Then this morning I came out to sit on my newly de-caterpillared deck and was out here drinking a cup of coffee when I noticed an eastern phoebe on a branch nearby making that same steady chirp it was making yesterday. I got this feeling it was one of the parents keeping an eye on me and warning the other that I was around. Does this sound right or am I inventing a narrative?

I definitely don't want to disturb the family and am trying to give them space, but I also do want to sit on the deck when it's nice out like it is now. Do you think the phoebes will get used to my presence? I'm not in view of the nest and am otherwise mostly avoiding the area where their nest is. I'm attaching a picture from where I'm sitting in an Adirondack partway down the deck. The nest is around the corner and down about 4-5 feet.

In May 28, 2025,  a mysterious kidnapping of a Russian couple in Palermo, Buenos Aires. The couple, who operated a cryptocurrency business, were abducted after meeting two Chechen nationals for coffee. They were assaulted, bound, and held captive until a ransom of $100,000 in USDT (a stablecoin) was paid via a QR code. The ransom negotiations were conducted by friends of the victims, who received photos of the couple tied up and beaten.

The suspects fled Argentina shortly after the incident, boarding a flight from Ezeiza International Airport to the United Arab Emirates. They are currently wanted by Interpol. The case is under investigation by the Argentine Federal Police's Anti-Kidnapping Division, with Judge María Romilda Servini 

This incident follows another case involving a Russian national, Ivan Materov, who was arrested earlier in May for allegedly orchestrating a $300 million cyber fraud using the Mekotio trojan virus. Materov's operation involved laundering funds through cryptocurrencies and was connected to a Telegram channel frequented by other Russians.

1kz4yiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1kz4yiy/aita_for_getting_my_husband_fired_after_he/,"AITA for getting my husband fired after he ""harassed"" me for cheating with his boss?","Edit: [with ALL UPDATES<------](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tox81FVVHUU&t=253s)

My marriage just went up in flames and half our town thinks I'm the devil. The other half won't even look at me. I'm sitting in my car outside a gas station at 2 AM writing this because I can't go home yet.

My husband worked at this mid-sized construction company for eight years. Started as crew, worked his way up to project manager. His boss was this guy who everyone said was going places, real smooth talker, always wore expensive suits even on job sites. Let's call him Mr. Suit.

Here's where it gets messy. My husband's been working 60-hour weeks for months. Coming home exhausted, barely talking, falling asleep on the couch most nights. I felt invisible. When Mr. Suit started paying attention to me at the company barbecue last summer, asking about my work, remembering little details, it felt good. Really good.

It started innocent, coffee meetings to ""discuss my husband's career development."" Then lunch. Then his hotel room downtown. Yeah, I know how it sounds. I know what I was doing. But for the first time in years, someone was actually seeing me, not just the wife who did laundry and made dinner.

Three months later, my husband came home early from a job site. Found Mr. Suit's car in our driveway. Found us in our bedroom. The look on his face, I'll never forget it. Not anger at first, just this broken confusion, like he couldn't process what he was seeing.

Mr. Suit grabbed his clothes and bolted. My husband just stood there for maybe ten minutes, not saying anything. Then he went to the garage and I heard him throwing things around, yelling.

The next day, he confronted Mr. Suit at work. In front of the whole crew. Started yelling about betrayal and how he trusted him. Mr. Suit tried to calm him down but my husband was beyond listening. Security had to escort him out.

That's when I made the call that changed everything.

I went to HR and filed a harassment complaint against my husband. Told them he was creating a hostile work environment, making threats, that I feared for my safety. I said he was unstable and might become violent at work. I even cried during the meeting.

They fired him the next day. Eight years, pension contributions, health insurance, gone. The official reason was ""violation of workplace conduct policies and threatening behavior toward management.""

But here's what I didn't expect. Word spreads fast in small towns.

Mr. Suit, trying to save his own reputation, started telling people that my husband had been ""acting erratic for months"" and that I had come to him ""concerned about domestic issues."" He painted himself as the concerned boss trying to help a troubled employee's wife. Made it sound like my husband was the problem all along.

My husband's crew found out the real story pretty quick. These guys had worked with him for years, knew he wasn't violent, knew something wasn't right. They started digging, asking questions. Someone saw Mr. Suit's car at our house multiple times. Someone else remembered seeing us at that downtown hotel restaurant.

Within a week, everyone knew. The grocery store clerk won't make eye contact. My book club disbanded. My sister won't return my calls. My husband's best friend's wife actually spit on my car windshield at the parking lot outside the school.

My husband moved in with his brother. He's not fighting the divorce, not asking for alimony, nothing. He just wants out. But he also can't find work anywhere in town. Eight years of experience and stellar references mean nothing when half the construction companies think you're unstable and the other half know you got played.

Mr. Suit? He got transferred to the company's office two towns over. Promoted, actually. Clean slate.

I keep telling people they don't understand the whole situation. That my marriage was already broken. That my husband had emotionally abandoned me long before I met Mr. Suit. That I was just trying to protect myself when I filed that report because I genuinely didn't know how he'd react.

But nobody wants to hear explanations. They see a woman who cheated with her husband's boss, then got him fired when he confronted the situation. They see someone who destroyed a good man's career to cover her own tracks.

My mom called yesterday and said maybe I should move away, start fresh somewhere else. Said staying here is just making it worse for everyone, including me.

The thing is, I really was scared that day. When my husband was throwing things in the garage, when he was so angry at work. I've seen what men can do when they feel humiliated. I've watched the news. I made that call to HR because I was legitimately worried about what might happen.

But now I'm wondering if I destroyed an innocent man's life just to avoid facing the consequences of my own choices.

So AITA? Was I protecting myself from a potentially dangerous situation, or did I ruin my husband's career because I got caught cheating and panicked?",1,1748613616.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

This is my first pond and has been set up for 2 months. The water tests fine every other day, snails are still cleaning away, no dead fish, so I'm guessing the water is OK. 

I did a 25% water change, vacummed the botton, added more plants and will be adding more, added 10lbs of lava rock in the pond (filter already has media in it for bacteria) and used an algaecide.

I am also training for hiking 14ers currently and would love to do it with someone if they are down for it. I don’t play games lot but do find some time to play rpg like Ghost of Tsushima. I am also a huge coffee addict, have my own espresso machine and have a home cafe setup and would love to also chat about coffee if you are interested. 

I am a huge movie and series buff and love discussing plots and what ifs. I am down to chat about anything interesting from politics to nature.

1kz4mx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1kz4mx5/should_i_keep_taking_it/,Should I keep taking it?,"I (22f) have been having seizures since I was 18. Over the past 3 ish years it's been kinda a seizure every 3-5 months. My last two were on Easter and then last Wednesday which was only like 5 weeks apart...

They think my seizures are probably from stress and for some reason I have been feeling super stressed out. I'm not exactly sure why but I cant seem to chill.

You can skip this if you want but...Since the beginning of May there has been a lot happening:

I sort of graduated college (I have an internship this summer and an online class in the fall and then I get my degree). 
I had to pack up my dorm room (I hate packing since it makes me sad) and move to another dorm room since I'm staying on campus this summer. 
I have to work cleaning the public bathrooms at my college to help pay for my rent and sometimes I wonder if the chemicals are affecting me. 
My fiancé and I are now long distance for 3 months or so after being basically together all the time for 2 years. He's living and working at home while looking for a ""real"" job since he can't work outside of his degree in this country. I dont think I'll be able to see him at all until he has a job, my internship is over, and we can get married. 
My internship is another stressor. With my degree I was supposed to be able to go overseas and live and work in a different culture. Because of my epilepsy I wasnt allowed. An acquaintance of my parents started a cafe with food from her home country and she said I could work there. Because it's an internship they decided to pay me for one of the three days I work. I've worked in coffee shops and things before so this doesn't stress me much but I havenr worked off campus in about 2 years which might be affecting me? 
I also can't drive and haven't for almost 3 years. This makes getting to work hard. Right now I've been getting a ride with my boss in the morning but she never has a specific schedule... it's 6:30-7:35... the other day I got a ride with her mom who speaks very little English and I felt bad because I couldnt really talk to her. Idk I just feel guilty always getting a ride from one of them. The bus system in my town sucks but I need To try it out sometime but I'm nervous to go alone. I'd also still have to walk like 20 minutes to the bus stop?? My bike tires are messed up, my town is suuuper hilly, and I'm out of shape. According to google it would only take me like 16 minutes to bike There but since I'm out of shape it would probably take me a lot longer and biking at 6:30 in the morning would not be my preference...
I've also kinda been thinking about my wedding and not really stressing about it but it's probably sitting in my mind too much. 
I also have an EMU Appointment coming up in 2 weeks and they haven't given me much information about it... and my neurologist isn't messaging me back... and my period is supposed to start in like 5 days. 
That's another thing, I'm wondering if my seizures could also be hormonal. My last one was during ovulation and I've just been feeling gross since then. Every time I'm on my period I feel like I'm gonna have a seizure. 

Anyway, you can probably tell I'm an overthinker. 

Last year someone I know gave me some 5mg edibles and I would take like half of one and I'd kinda just chill out and feel less stressed. I ran out and hadn't had any for awhile (like 5 months?). I saw them again and they gave me some more last week. These were 100mg ones though. I cut them into like 8 pieces and ate one and felt fine and kinda just went to bed. I usually use melatonin but that time I just fell right asleep. The last few days though I've felt awful. I dont think it's the gummies but because I overthink I've been overthinking that they are the problem. The past few days I feel Like I might have been having focal seizures. 

Out of no where my mom actually texted me and told me that maybe I should go get some edibles to help me lol. I told her I had some but I wasnt taking them and she said why not bc the emergency meds I have are probably worse on me than thc. So I took another the other afternoon and I felt fine besides a slight twinge of seizure feeling. Yesterday at work I kept feeling kinda seizurey so I took one around 4:30 (keep in mind this is probably only like 12mg bc I'm taking peices of it) and my friend and I went over to someone's house to watch a movie. It was like 5 something and I was already feeling tired that day but I fell asleep so fast in the middle of that movie. Drooled everywhere. After I woke up I felt less tired and my heart was kinda beating fast. Which that seems to happen when I wake up unexpectedly or even expectedly. 

So anyway... I feel like these edibles kinda just make me tired lol

I need some more info on if I should Keep taking them? Tbh I would probably rather take them than the emergency drugs...

My normal medicine is 100mg of briviact and I have 0.5mg of clonazePAM for ""emergencies"" and I usually only take half of one since they're chewable. 

I dont really have anyone to talk to about this bc I do go to a Christian college and my friends would not take any and also don't know enough lol. My mom doesn't know much either. The friend I got them from takes it recreationally too so idk if I can talk to her. My aunt has seizures but doesn't use cannabis anymore bc she has small children...

Anyway, help??

TL;DR:
I’m 22F with epilepsy (diagnosed at 18), currently on Briviact + emergency clonazepam. My seizures are infrequent (every few months), likely stress-related, but maybe hormone related. Life has been very stressful (college, moving, long-distance fiancé, internship, transportation issues, etc.). I’ve used low-dose THC edibles in the past to help with stress and just started again. Not sure if they’re helping or making things worse since they're a different kind. Looking for advice on whether it’s okay to keep using them occasionally, especially as an alternative to emergency meds.

Also when should I stop taking them before my EMU? Weed is not legal where I am...",1,1748612787.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False

looking for some insight ! for context -

i went to a bar on saturday night and had some chicken wings and nachos , immediately after i had sharp stomach pains and chest pains.

no bowel movement that night or sunday. monday was pebbles once and tuesday i decided to use a suppository and nothing came from that just liquid.

i decided to try restrolax for the first time yesterday ( wednesday ) morning mixed into my coffee and that helped me have a somewhat solid bowel movement.

thursday i tried it again but just mixed in water, no bowel movements and noticed my pee was difficult to start. didn’t think too much of it till later in the night i was bloated so bad i look pregnant.

that’s when i decided to use the suppository again , left it for 20 mins and went to use the bathroom, again it was very underwhelming.

1 hour later and it was awful , yes lots was coming out ( an orange color , which i found alarming but maybe it’s ok ? ) but it was hurting so badly i’ve never felt stomach pain like that in my life; i was sweating felt faint and now ive ran to the bathroom almost 3-4 times since taking it!


its the next morning and my stomach is still cramping

I am so bloody confused...no pun intended 😜

I’m 33 (turning 34), had my second baby in Feb 2024, and my period returned around June. My cycles were fairly regular at 31–33 days. But the last two cycles have stretched out — one was 39 days, and I’m currently on day 44 with no period in sight. My last period started on April 17. 

Side note: I have done approx. 7 pregnancy tests over the last 2 weeks (first morning wee) and they've all been negative despite all the symptoms listed below 🤷🏼‍♀️ I am not using hormonal birth control. 

I know postpartum hormones can take at least 2 years to level out, but this feels a bit different — like I’m stuck in constant PMS mode without my period arriving, I haven't felt like this with any other cycles (apart from the previous cycle (39 days). I’ve attached a screenshot from my Clue app and another cycle tracker for reference — I track most symptoms most days.

Lately I’ve been experiencing:

- Ongoing dull cramping in my lower abdomen/ovary area- like a period is coming
- That “need to pee” feeling, even right after going (I do drink lots of water and coffee though) and a near/constant increased libido which is driving me insane 🫣 🤯
- I had Slippery/egg white discharge from around day 23 to 35 which would've been when I ovulated most likely but I still get a slippery discharge when I wipe every now and then. 
- I had light spotting on days 24–26 (which is super rare for me)
Side Note: my husband and I did have unprotected sex a couple of days before that, using the withdrawal method — but we were very careful (or so we think 😳😅)
- Constant breakouts on my chin — they clear and come back again quickly
- Occasional breast “tingles” or a letdown-type sensation - not painful just noticeable. 
- PMDD symptoms (low mood, anxiety, intrusive thoughts) have been way milder or even absent — which is honestly amazing, but also strange for me too. 

Has anyone experienced something similar, especially 15+ months postpartum and around my age?
I’m so confused about what’s going on.
I can't get into my GP for another week to sort out blood tests etc. 

I’d really appreciate hearing your experience and anything that helped regulate your cycle (foods, supplements, lifestyle, etc.), or even relieved these symptoms.

Red splotches and bumps and small red spidering lines. I was horrified and depressed. My skin burned and tingled tremendously. I thought I had skin cancer. I am 40 and very fit and active.

I finally went to the dermatologist and he immediately said it was  Rosacea. He told me to cut out all coffee, chocolate, hot showers, spices and acidic food. He said to use mild soaps. I did what he said cold turkey, and the burning died down 80% the first week, but the general redness and splotches persisted and grew. I bought a Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar and I stopped using regular soap. The dermatologist gave me Pimecrolimus cream to apply twice per day  and told me to watch for trigger foods.

After researching Rosacea, I determined that I would attack the following things in my life: 1. lose weight, 2. eliminate all sugars, diary, spices, coffee. I read that you have to establish a baseline for foods that do not flare Rosacea, and then add foods back in to see how your skins reacts. So I began eating the following every day:  
Breakfast: Either Steel cut plain oatmeal, or 2 hard boiled eggs and 1 slice of Dave's Killer whole grain bread, both with nothing added. No butter, jam, pepper, etc.

Lunch : A big portion of Quinoa and either a quarter pound of 100% turkey breast or Chicken breast. No seasoning or oils added to any of it

Dinner: A piece of Wegmans wild caught frozen, air fried haddock or cod, asparagus, Quinoa, air fried small round potatoes (5). No seasoning added or oils added.

To take the hunger pains away, I snack on small portions of air popped popcorn and pumpkin seeds with no oil, or seasonings. 

NOTE: I originally was including nuts, spinach, lettuce, cucumbers, and celery, but was able to determine that they seemed to cause a rosacea reaction, so I eliminated them and the symptoms reduced. In general I suspect any food with acidity, cinnamaldehyde or high histamine content is a trigger.

I purposely went to bed hungry and intentionally started to lose weight. I heard that even a slightly high BMI can be a common underlying factor in part.

By the end of week 2, I saw my very first reduction in redness and spidering. After years of seeing a gradual increase of Rosacea, I now see my first gradual reduction in Rosacea!!!!

The obvious question is if it is the Pimecrolimus  cream and/or the diet changes? Could be either one or both working together. I will keep both the cream and diet pattern until my face is back completely, then I will stop one and wait to see what happens.

Sensei strode into the makeshift class while sipping a cup of coffee from a NWO mug he got at a gift shop down in Bunker 11 while on vacation with Marie. Ah, yes. It was another one of those beautiful memories that was difficult to wrest from his restless mind. The fact that he always thought about his star-crossed lover at the worst time. Even now, he found himself idling across from his three eager beaver students doing it again. Ah, love. It was an *unshakable* addiction, and like any good addict, he had been chasing after that nascent high ever since their first kiss on that cool summer evening in their English Garden. Back then it was just the two of them against the world. The highs were long-lasting, and the lows were short-lived. He wanted his old life back as desperately as he wanted to see her again so he could hold her in his arms and say—    

“Ahem! Hello, Sensei,” Wicked Stepmother said.

Her voice yanked him away from his holiday at Bunker 11, which was how he got this “trashy” mug in the first place. A gift for his beloved that she did not love at all and promptly gave back to Eliza, so she could give back to him, along with a sharp note on his poor taste in gifts. Man... those were the days, he thought while chasing after her imaginary arms and the fevered memory of them spending all day together in bed. How they locked themselves in their room on the last day of their trip. It was a day spent ordering ridiculous amounts of room service that they could never hope to eat, kissing their problems goodbye with a devil-may-care attitude, and shooing away concerned escorts and attendants whenever they had the audacity to knock.

What it was was one of those vampire customs, um, I’m sure it’s in that dusty old handbook for benevolent rulers, you know, the one we can never seem to find when we need it. Surely it’s around here somewhere and surely there’s an article or section somewhere in there about freeing underlings from service on the last day of vacation...” or at least that’s how he explained away their youthful indiscretion.

As you can probably imagine, he wasn’t too happy with his excuse. Devil or not, that was still his daughter, and they had just started their blood rituals. He was going to teach this upstart a lesson, and oh boy did he, with twice the administrative workload and twice the number of guild missions. It was worth it. She was the only reason he had returned from a place of *darkness* when he died and saw the *lady...* Ah, yes, with a sad smile, he said farewell to his dreams and replied to Wicked Stepmother’s abrupt greeting with a deliberate, “Hello.”

Wicked Stepmother didn’t care about dreams. She was a woman, uhm, a girl who was firmly grounded in empirical evidence. She had been tempered by rationality’s blade; a determined scientist, who simply smiled when smiled at or returned a greeting because, well, that’s the thing you were supposed to do when an esteemed colleague said something. She was sitting behind the bar on a stool in what had become her improvised workspace, inputting data and notes into her laptop while simultaneously swiping away graphs and charts on her tablet.

Sensei looked over at you and said “hello.” You were standing in your usual spot in the parlor, next to the entrance, right behind the recess with the shelves that were filled with rare blood wines, cool collectables, and vampire trinkets from Marie’s formative years. Nano was in the desk directly across from you. Nero was on the opposite side, and Lenda’s desk was in the middle. She came bolting through the door, right when the alarm on Sensei’s phone began to chime, made a jump for it like an Asian carp, and landed on the floor, right next to her seat.

*“I’m not late! My hand’s touching the chair!”*

Sensei just shook his head. “Sure. Why not.”

She flipped to her feet and cheered. *“Yes!* I can’t believe I made it! I knew it! See! If you put your mind to it you can do it! Ha! I wish my dad was here to—""

Her happiness melted in her mouth like a grilled cheese sandwich fresh off the griddle when she looked around and saw all the sizzling stares that were as sharp as cheddar. The embarrassment was enough to make her hush up, hunch her back, and creep into her seat. She did manage to say “Sorry” on her way down from cloud nine, which was very polite.

Sensei looked over at you and shook his head in shame. Too bad he found out about her secret Reddit poll when it was already too late. Because if he had a vote, hah, let’s just say he would have voted for the couch. Why? Well, while thinking about the big question, he took a sip of coffee, and then told the class clown, “I think you have something that belongs to me.”

“Huh? I didn’t steal anything, I swear!” she protested.

“The Skittles I left on the counter in the entertainment room.”

“Wait? You eat those things too? Oh, wow! I have something in common with a legendary ninja! Hmm. I wonder what else do we have in common? What’s your favorite color? Who’s your favorite streamer? Do you have a favorite fallen angel—mine is Sarahiel.”  

“We don’t have anything in common,” he told her.

“W-what do you mean?” she asked hesitantly.

“I don’t eat candy. I hate streams. Hmm... black would be my choice in color. And my preferred archdemon is Ark Haven,” he said very coldly.

“Sorry,” Lenda mumbled with a deflated expression. “I don’t like streamers—is how you would say it but whatever. My life has returned to being sucky.”

“I left the Skittles as a test to see if you could resist the urge to take something that didn’t belong to you. It should have been obvious by the fact that they were not there when you cased the place the night before the story started. I shouldn’t have to say it, but the fact that I’m asking for them back is a clear indication that you failed,” he said before examining his other two pupils and throwing in, “Stay sharp. Because I’ll be doing this to both of you, from time to time. Testing your wits when you least expect it in a way you’d least expect it.”

Nero shrugged whatever and Nano didn’t even blink. After taking note of their responses, he returned his attention to Lenda and said, “Let me guess, you ate them?”

She nodded “yes” like a convicted vampire-juvie.

“In that case, you get the pleasure of going first,” Sensei said before gesturing for her to stand and “Please, tell us all about your homework assignment. How would you destroy the world?”

“Fine...” she murmured before standing and opening the note app on her phone.

But before she could even clear her throat, Wicked Stepmother tore her eyes away from her laptop and said, “Your plan better not be the one your father gave us.”

Lenda threw up her hands. “Jeez, I can’t catch a break around here.”

“I knew it! She stole her father’s destruction plan,” Wicked told Sensei.

“Operation Red Dove? The one where we release a mutated rabies virus?”

“That’s the one,” Wicked Stepmother nodded.

“Huh. Interesting. But not surprising,” he said while giving the idea some thought. “Is that still the plan? It’s a rather good one.”

“Nope. We scrapped it,” she told him.

“Huh? What about all the groundbreaking research we gained during the pandemic into human psychology? How isolation alters the brain.”

“Wasted like always,” she replied.

“That’s very unfortunate.”

Wicked Stepmother threw up her hands and told him, “Humph. Don’t look at me. You can blame the Walking Dead for that one.”

“Hah! The media strikes again,” Sensei said before pointing at Nero and saying, “Your turn.”

“I say we drop a ton of nukes,” he said from his seat.

“And what would be the pretense?” Sensei asked.

“What does ‘pretense’ mean?” he asked.

“Atrocities are usually accompanied by excuses.”

“Really? Why would I need that?” he asked.

“Because we can’t just go around launching nukes.”

“I thought all you had to do was hit the red button.”

“It’s a phone not a button in the dummy president’s ‘nuclear’ briefcase. He is given a careful list of instructions on who to call in the event of an unscripted emergency. So... even if he wants to launch a nuclear missile, he can’t. He doesn’t have the power. It has to be authorized by the Chairman of the United States, i.e., the person Lenda often refers to as the ‘shadow president.’”

Nero looked at her and asked, “Your dad, right?”

“No. He’s the vice shadow president, silly.”

“You mean vice chairman,” Sensei corrected her.

“Whatever. Can we not talk about him, please?” Lenda asked with a bit of an attitude. And besides, laughing at Nero’s ignorance was way more entertaining. I mean, what the hell was he thinking? What, that they could just *bash* their way into the heavens without anything that resembled a plan. This funny thought was enough to raise her angry puffy cheeks back into a sneaky squirrely smile.

Sensei ignored her antics and continued to teach his unlearned pupil the ways of the Illuminati: “For stability reasons her father, the vice chair, will become chairman after four years—around the same time we pick the next dummy president. Also, the chairman picks his or her vice chair, unlike in the dummy government, where the vice president acts solely as an inferior backup. We keep things this way to maintain order in the shadow government, and disorder in the *indivisible* government, heh. Anything less and the audience might get the urge to look behind the curtains instead of keeping their eyes focused on the shiny object in front of them.”

Sensei mentioned the last part while having a glance your way. You had no idea why he did that. Well, he was that type of vampire. Impossible to befriend and even more impossible to decipher. A black void that was as deep as an ocean. Lenda followed his dark eyes. I would say she rescued you from his ominous radius but does mockery count? She playfully asked, “if you even knew what the illuminati was all about?” While chortling she asked Nero the same thing.

He was far too prideful to admit that he had no clue. Instead, he made a fool out of himself with his blasphemous words: “Yeah. I know who they are. They’re the bullies who want to knock over God’s sandcastle. Hah! And with my help, we’ll make him, and his arrogant crew of angels, go wah, wah, wah in no time. Trust me, it’ll be as easy as taking candy from a baby.”

Lenda covered her mouth and fought back a tide of inappropriate laughter, Wicked Stepmother stared at him like he was a dope, and Nano did nothing. Sensei smirked a bit but decided to humor his clueless pupil. He knew that most of Nero’s life had been spent in the Holy Order. A clandestine organization like the Illuminati was probably a topic that rarely crossed their minds. Which was a good thing, of course. It allowed them to grow like tentacles within the vacuum of space. A startling realization that was made even more disturbing by his words:

“The idea is to remain hidden in plain view through spell and ritual. Our magic will not work if you notice it. And the less you see the easier you are to control. We call them sheep because we hid in plain sight like wolves in sheep’s clothing. The goal of our organization is to be the friend that’s far worse than the enemy. Our aim is to slowly shear the sheeple, *just enough,* so that they never *see* how razor thin they came to being skinned alive. And to their politicians and evangelist we say, ‘Let the fools have their gold and we will have our wool.’”

“I don’t get it,” Nero said in response.

“You failed,” he told him.

“Great,” he said before exhaling in frustration. A very upsetting thought occurred to him. *This is going to be a lot harder than I thought. Maybe I can’t just* ***bash*** *my way into the heavens.* Alas, his only solace came in the form of a humiliating pat on the back from Lenda. You know, the person who had just finished laughing at him for the umpteenth time. Yeah, she was the one currently assuaging his shattered ego.

“Nano,” Sensei said.

“I am listening.”

“I’m already aware that you would regurgitate several excellent plans. And I’m sure you and your fellow SAIs have already simulated the doomsday scenario to perfection. But what I’m interested in is a little different. Tell me, out of all the ways we can bring the world to its knees, which way is the least rational but most likely to succeed if implemented flawlessly.”

Nano blinked in confusion. “Your question is illogical.”

“Nothing in life is ever that logical. If it were, scientists would rule the world, not us.”

“I require more time to process this new deviation.”

“You can’t conquer them if they don’t understand them.”

“This is a very reasonable assessment,” he confirmed.

“It should be orthodoxy by now,” he told him before turning to Wicked Stepmother and telling her that the floor was hers. “Please share with my students a plan worthy of praise.”

“Project Blue Beam,” she announced quickly.

“Hey! That’s my plan,” Lenda objected.

“It’s not! Your dad’s plan emphasizes the use of a mutant RABV to control the population. Our old plan did not! That’s right, ‘old.’ It had to be scrapped because of some stupid book, by some stupid conspiracy theorist. That’s okay we got him back in spades. We took care of the problem so there’s really no reason we can’t move forward with the project, *but* you know how the leading members of the Illuminati are. Everything has to be done in secret, or they turn skittish and run back to the shadows like a herd of chattering cats!” Wicked Stepmother bemoaned.

Sensei smirked at her childish rant. It made him wonder what the late Doctor Jane thought about her petulant child clone, “Kid Susan,” who had become something of an unintended research project into identity and interactionism herself. He made note of the thought, which for some reason, reminded him to ask if he could speak with the AI Matrix, who they referred to as “Mother,” before turning his attention to something a tad more pressing: “Okay. There is one more matter we must discuss before we can begin our mission. The poll on Reddit.”

“Huh? You know about that?” Lenda asked in surprise.

“Of course I do. I even know the results,” he told her.

“Unholy moly! Drum roll please!” she said with glee.

Sensei paused. Hopefully the biting atmosphere would sink into her arm like shark teeth. I mean, she had basically become a kiss up artist, doing the most, in her campaign to win you over. And with that, he said, “Our wonderful friend, the Reader, did not vote.”

“Yes! I knew it! If you’re happy and you—wait what?!” she asked mid cheer.

“The Reader abstained from the poll,” Sensei repeated coldly.

“They did not? Seriously?” Lenda uttered while picking up her phone and scrolling to the poll in question. “Oh devil. They didn’t! M-maybe it was broken?”

“It’s not. You just suck,” Nero said.

“Well, if I suck you suck too!”

“What?” he asked with a smirk.

*“Yeah.* That didn’t come out right.”

“That’s what she said,” Nero sneered.

Lenda just stared at him for a moment with her mouth open in shock. You know what? She wasn’t even going to entertain his rude-crude neanderthal-like remark. Nope. Not this time, buddy. This time she was going to be the bigger vampire. *Hah! Maybe that’ll help the Reader vote for me the next time we have a popularity poll.* Or at least, that’s what she told herself. It was an unholy mantra that had her stuck in some pretty deep thought-sand. “Hmm. I can’t believe this—why didn’t they vote? Oh, I know!” She looked over at you and probably shouldn’t have said what she was thinking aloud. “I got it! It’s because you couldn’t figure out which one of us was your favorite—that’s why. Aah! I knew it. You love us all way too much to just pick only one. Aww! That’s very noble of you not to vote like that just to make me feel happy,” she said with batting eyes.

“Heh. Are you telling the Reader that, or are you telling yourself that so you can sleep better at night? We all know you were dying to be voted prom queen,” Nero snickered.

*“Err! I HaTe you!!”* she exclaimed.

At first, it was simple—chats at lunch, small talk over coffee. But three months in, something deeper grew between us, and we made it official.

Our 6 months relationship wasn’t perfect, but it was real. We had small fights, like any couple, but we always made it a point to reconcile before we went to sleep. I thought that meant something.

One night stands out vividly in my memory—a friend’s birthday dinner. He was so sweet, so caring, that I didn’t want the night to end. For a moment, it felt like forever was possible.

But then... something changed.

The next day, his replies became cold. Then came the silence. At work, he avoided me. A week later, over a message, he said we should “take a break.” That he wasn’t ready. That we weren’t on the same page.

He broke up with me—not in person, not even with a call—but with a message.

I was shattered. I couldn’t understand how someone who was so loving could just disappear emotionally overnight. I didn’t agree to a “pause”—I let him go completely. Because I couldn’t live in limbo.

Months passed, painfully. I tried everything to heal. I distracted myself, I entertained new people, but I couldn't truly let go. Every time I saw him at work, I felt like I was bleeding from a wound no one could see.

I stalked him online. I asked friends about him. And eventually, I saw there was someone else. It hurt even more, but I kept looking anyway, like reopening a wound that had just started to scab over.

It’s embarrassing to admit—but I couldn't stop loving him. No matter how hard I tried, that love never left.

And then, eleven months later... he messaged me.

“I’m sorry.”

He said it again. And again. For two weeks straight. He told me he made a mistake. That he was scared. That he wasn’t ready then, but he is now. He said he wants me back.

He apologized for breaking my heart.

And now here I am—months after I let go, barely healed, suddenly facing the very thing I prayed for… but not knowing if I should take it.

It's my first time experiencing an ex who wants me back after we broke up 11 months ago. His words melt my heart again, but I know that's not enough to trust him. He said he's open to talking about everything that happened and answering any questions I have.

Back in the ‘90s, some Swedish chemist wasn’t into soy milk and figured out how to turn oats into a drink using enzymes. Boom — oat milk. Tastes decent, shelf-stable enough, great for people who can’t do dairy.

Then a guy from the nightlife scene takes over the company (seriously), and it turns into... something else entirely. OATLY! Suddenly Oatly is this hyper-branded lifestyle thing. Cartons with slogans like *“It’s like milk, but made for humans.”* They get sued by the dairy industry and turn the lawsuit into marketing. Like, they print it on stuff.

Then they go full chaos mode and launch a campaign telling people to flush cow’s milk down the toilet. Not kidding.

It actually works. They blow up in coffee shops. Hipster cafés switch to Oatly as the default. Celebs invest. They IPO at $10 billion. For oat milk. You can’t make this up.

But under the hood? Total mess.

Massive production issues. Factories can’t scale. Supply chain’s a disaster. Gross margins are trash (20%, when food companies usually aim for 35–40%). They burned through $417M in 2023 alone.

Turns out turning a niche enzyme-based product into a global CPG brand isn’t super simple. Who knew.

Anyway, I wrote up a full breakdown of the whole thing — from the original oat chemistry to the brand explosion to the financial cliff dive.

She looks around thinking its her husband when she sees something hiding. She demands for it to come out but a woman that looks exactly like her comes out and attacks her. 

She demands to know what she wants and she responds that she is going to replace her and destroy her life and her husband will never know the difference since she is her exact clone with her memories and fighting capabilities. 

She gets angry and protective and they fight but a few minutes later her husband comes home from a long day of work. He opens the door and sees his spy wife fighting a clone of herself. 

They notice him and plead with him to listen to them and they try to convince who is the clone and who is the original.

 He panics and one begins to explain that she came home from the agency and she was about to make dinner when this clone appeared and attacked her but the other dismisses her claims that she attacked her without warning and was making an amazing dinner for him. 

She tells him that the clone has all her memories which will make it difficult to tell which is the clone and the original. 

He decides to ask them questions to see if they will get it right and they say ok. He asks them where did they first meet and they respond the coffee shop while she was on a assignment. Then he asks what was her cover story when they met and they respond with a secretary which is correct. Then he asks how did he find out she was a spy and they respond with that he followed her because he thought she was cheating on him.

 After the questions it was really hard for him to tell which is the fake and the original but one of them says that she loves him with all her heart and she is glad to know and love him but the other criticizes her for using his love to get rid of one.

 He then gets an idea and they ask what it is. He says if the clone acts like the original then he pulls out a flute and plays a song which makes one cry and the other confuse. The one says thats the song her mother used to play for her when she was little before she was forced into the agency. 

The other is confused when he pulls out a tazer from a drawer and tosses it to his wife. The clone realizes she was caught and begs but the spy wife tazes her and she vanishes. Her husband collapses from everything and she runs up to him and hugs and kisses him. 

She thanks him for saving her life and she brings him to the couch and she sits next to him. She showers him with kisses, flirting and praising. 

She tells him that everyday her love for him grows stronger even though he’s a civilian. She tells him that some of her coworkers are jealous of their relationship. 

She tells him that before she met him she used to cold, heatless and not a care in the world but after she met him she had a feeling she hasnt felt since she was young. 

She tells him even though he's a civilian with no martial arts or spy training she loves him with all her heart.

 She tells him that she may have lied about her profession but she didnt lie about her feelings. She tells him that they still havent had dinner so why don’t they go get takeout and he agrees but they need to take care of the mess and they share a laugh.

The Summer Infant 17013 3Dlite Convenience Stroller offers an impressive lightweight design, weighing just over 14 pounds. Its aluminum frame keeps it durable, while the 100% recycled fabric upholstery aligns beautifully with sustainable choices. I’ve found it incredibly easy to fold and unfold on the go, even one-handed, as I juggled my toddler’s bag and a cup of coffee. The compact folded size is a lifesaver when squeezing it into the back of my car alongside groceries. Though it feels light to carry, the sturdiness was undeniable, even on uneven pavements.

**Comfort and Security for Your Little One**

A padded seat and five-point safety harness make for a secure and cozy ride for my six-month-old niece. The adjustable straps grow with the child, which simplifies things over time, and the multi-position recline feature was particularly great during her naps. I adjusted the backrest to a near-flat position while strolling through the park so she could sleep peacefully. The extended pop-out sun visor with UPF 50+ provides a reassuring level of sun protection, something especially handy during sunny summer strolls. While I appreciated all these features, I noticed the seat could feel slightly narrow for larger toddlers, whose legs started to look a bit cramped.

**[Check Summer Infant 17013 price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0d5bgknbx/)**

**Smooth Riding Experience**

The anti-shock front wheels offer a noticeably smooth ride, even on cobblestone streets and gravel trails. Strolling with it around the park felt comfortable, as the cushioned handles eased strain on my hands. Rear lockable wheels ensure stability when I needed to park it momentarily, such as during a coffee stop. However, one thing that did catch my attention was that the anti-shock system, while effective, didn’t always absorb the bigger bumps entirely, making it feel slightly jolty compared to more premium travel strollers.

**Favorable Aspects**

- Incredibly lightweight yet sturdy.
- Easy one-hand fold and compact storage.
- Multi-position recline supports nap times.
- UPF 50+ sun visor ensures protection.
- Anti-shock wheels enhance maneuverability.  

**Storage and Parent-Friendly Features**

Storage options on this stroller are top-notch. The large undercarriage basket has been a lifesaver for storing diaper bags, snacks, and shopping items. Despite loading it heavily once, the stroller didn’t feel unbalanced. Additional perks include the handy parent cup holder and a rear pocket perfect for small essentials like keys or a phone. However, if you overpack the basket, accessing items beneath a reclined seat can be tricky.

**Limitations**

- Seat might feel narrow for larger toddlers.
- Anti-shock system doesn't handle deep uneven terrain flawlessly.
- Overfilled storage basket can be hard to reach with the recline.

**Ideal for Urban Strollers**

The product feels geared toward urban environments and light travel rather than rugged outdoor activities. If you’re navigating city sidewalks, using public transportation, or hunting for something functional yet lightweight, it’s a natural fit. However, for mountain hikes or rocky paths, something with larger wheels could be a better match. 

**Competing Products**

Two competitors immediately came to mind during my testing: the Babyzen YOYO² and the Kolcraft Cloud Plus. The YOYO² also folds compactly and comes with a sleek, modern design but sits at a steeper price point and doesn't include a snack tray or as much storage space. The Kolcraft Cloud Plus is in the same price range as this stroller, offering a lightweight frame and significant storage but misses out on features like adjustable recline and anti-shock wheels. This stroller strikes a fine balance, and it outshines its competitors in day-to-day practicality—particularly with easy folding, sun protection, and its premium feel despite the affordable category.

**Budget-Friendly Pick**

Looking at its versatile features and everyday usability, this stroller offers an excellent bang for the buck. While there are strollers that cost less, they often sacrifice reliability or convenience. With superior safety mechanisms, smooth handling, and thoughtful add-ons like multiple storage options, every feature aligns with what you’d expect for its price without feeling overpriced. Whether you’re a parent on a tight budget or someone who values cost-effectiveness, it’s hard not to appreciate the value it delivers.

Colton Cruz...When my name rolls of your lips, it should be fear that consumes you. I did not become the best in the business by playing it straight. You will find me on the wrong side of the law and your go-to-man for almost anything. But what I do best is protect the Stone Crime Boss and his family. My next assignment, Trinity Stone, spoiled brat, and daughter to Vic and Alexa Stone.

This is not what I do, I do not babysit, but little Miss 'I can do what I want has every single one of my men refusing to shadow her. She is a nightmare, and I am the one that has to put up with her.

The last time I saw Trinity was over a year ago; I work for Vic and only Vic. You can imagine my frustration when the final one of my men came into my office a little less than a week ago to throw the towel in. She gave him the slip, and he had the full wrath of Vic come down on him. This is where I come in; if I cannot keep Trinity under control, I lose the contract. And then I might as well close my doors.

So I find myself driving through the early morning traffic on a somewhat miserable and rainy day for my first day of babysitting duty. Jax has come along as he shall be looking after Alexa today. Ever since the recent turf war, Vic and his family have required constant protection.

For so many times this morning, I grunt and moan for I would not even want to be seen dead with little Miss Princess in private.

""The last time I saw this girl, she had braces and wore glasses bigger than my ass.""

""I have never seen her before, but coming from the boys, she is a classic brat.""

""I promise you if this woman gives me the slip, then I am tying her to a tree.""

""Hey, maybe you can have a little thing on the side since Amber so gracefully left you.""

""Gracefully? She left in the night while I was sleeping. She was too shit scared to look me in the eye and tell me she was banging the neighbor.""

""Still, classic man. And now you have Misses Muffet to keep you company.""

Just thinking of her sends shivers up my spine and belief me that they are not the good shivering kind. I love a beautiful woman both in my bed and to look at. To be surrounded by ugly for almost a full day is seriously going to put a damper on my ego.

But time to push that thought to the side, for our location has just come up on the right. We slowly cruise up the driveway and park at the back of this very old-style white mansion. We are soon met by one of my men that stays on the property at the back.

""Morning, boss, just thought I would come to give you the heads up. Little Princess is throwing a tantrum this morning.""

""What is new? The damn woman is a nightmare.""

""She does not want a tail, least of all you. She said you are an arrogant asshole.""

""Hahaha. That makes her...""

Just then, we see Alexa appear in the doorway, waving us on to come inside. Here goes another damn session with tea and cake, and when I say cake, I mean the real doughy shit.

So we casually make our way in, but as we step through the doorway, we can hear a woman scream at the top of her voice. It is more like the whining of an annoying bug. And listening to the pleas of the other man, we can safely establish that it is Vic. Alexa only but smiles as I walk past her.

""Just excuse Trinity; she is not always like this.""

I nearly choke on my own breath...she is not always like this? It is like all the damn time. I have heard this girl have a hissy fit when I am in Vic's office on the other side of the house.

We are slowly coming up to the kitchen; I start to brace myself for the horror is about to happen.

And then, as we turn the corner...

…TRINITY POV…

It is a cold and miserable day; the rain has been coming down in a drizzle since six this morning. Today I am going to the salon, and for some stupid reason, I need a bodyguard. This is not my turf war; I do not want to have some big and buff brainless man following me around. I have given all the others the slip; this one will be just as easy.

I go for what is the fifth dress now and pull it up from over my thighs. I wiggle my ass as Islip them over and tuck in my breasts. I give one last spin as I look into the tall mirror on the far side wall of my walk-in closet. I am pleased with what I see; let's see how Mr. Bodyguard can catch this from slipping away from him.

But first, it is my father and me; I do not even see any of my friends because of these damn men following me around. And let us not even go to having a boyfriend; I cannot even remember when last I was with a man.

So I make my way downstairs to where daddy dearest is having his coffee in the kitchen.

""Daddy, please, can you just let me go out by myself.""

""No, Trinity, you shall go out with Colton.""

""Colton? What happened to the other guy?""

""Please do not act stupid. You are running out of bodyguards. Can you stop trying to get away, these men are getting tired of your tantrums.""

""What tantrums? I don't have tantrums. I want to do what I want to do; I do not need a babysitter.""

""Trinity, you are getting one. End of story!""

""Can I at least pick them? This one is probably an arrogant asshole.""

""No! You are getting Colton. If you don't like him, then you can stay at home.""

This Colton better be something special. And from what mom said, he is the very last of them. But not only that, apparently he is the best.

Then all of a sudden, there are three men coming around the corner...

…COLTON POV…

Just as we turn the corner, there is a tall brunette in what could possibly be the tightest dress I have ever seen. But what strikes me the most is her long slender legs that are held up by deep blood red stilettos. Her long locks of hair fall like waterfalls over her shoulders. Just looking at those plump lips is enough to send me raging. I don't know who she is, but she is hot.

Needless to say, I chuck my hands into my pockets, for I do require a bit of adjusting after seeing that. And to make things worse, I become a stuttering idiot.

""Mor...Morning Mr. Stone.""

""Morning, Colton.""

Out of the corner of my eye, I can see her smiling. There is a warmth that shoots straight to my core. My knees give in, and every bone in my body becomes like jelly.

""Colton, you remember Trinity.""

I spin on my heels and face this towering beauty. This is Trinity? What happened to the ugly girl with braces and glasses? This woman is gorgeous; she is definitely close to perfect.

""Not quite like this, Mr. Stone.""

""Oh yes, you have not seen her for a while. Well, my little princess has grown a bit.""

""I...I can see that.""

""Now, Trinity, you do not give this man a hard time.""

With that, she leaves the kitchen to go get her purse; as she swifts past me, I can smell the sweet scents of jasmine and vanilla. I cannot but help to stare at that goddamn ass fora fraction too long.

While Vic excuses himself to get something from the office, I stand closer to Jax and try to talk as soft as possible.

""I would love to tie that to a bed, not a tree. When did she get so damn hot?""

""Guess all the trips to the salon has paid off.""

""The guys said that she is a brat. They never told me how hot she is.""

""Wait until she throws a tantrum.""

""If she throws a tantrum, then I am pinning her to a wall.""

""Hahaha. I think Vic will pin something else for you.""

""This poses as a problem. She is making me hard just looking at her.""

Then all of a sudden, I hear the click-clack of her heels behind me. I truly hope that she has not listened to a single word that I have been saying.

""Do you always creep up on people?""

""Only when they are talking about me.""

""I was not talking about you, Miss Stone.""

""Please call me Trinity, and I know my ass just got you slightly uncomfortable.""

My face flushes a red, one shade darker than her deep cherry lipstick. But she does seem to be very pleased with herself as the most seductive smile starts to form in the corners of her lips. Those velvety lips that I would like to devour very slowly and softly as I melt into her skin.

Much to my frustration, as we walk to the car, she walks ahead in front of me. She is swaying those hips, and god knows she is doing it on purpose. She has seen what effect she has on me, and this little vixen is getting pleasure from torturing me.

And being the gentleman that I am, I politely open the car door for her. I watch as she lifts those gorgeous legs one by one into the car. But as she flips them, yes, does she flip those legs. She sees that I have noticed exactly what she intended. She smiles at me from underneath her fluttering eyelashes.

I close the door and grind hard on my teeth, barely able to hide my very obvious frustration. As I slide into the driver's seat, I look at her and softly whisper to myself.

""She is going to be a problem…""Chapter 2 Given The Slip

Mmm.....Trinity Stone.....

My worst nightmare has now just become the reason why I am sitting with a somewhat uncontrollable itch. It has taken me a few adjustments, but I think I have it under control. But then I go and think of her and the lack of basic necessities, and then it is a raging war in my pants all over again.

But then I take her. I place my hand rather roughly and hard down onto her knee. I want her to feel me, and I want her to feel it hard. I want her to whimper every time she thinks of me touching her. And as I slowly slide my hand up her long slender leg, it is the softness of her skin, the tenderness, and her smell that sends me even closer to the edge. With every glorious inch, my hands creep up her thighs until I have my fingers tangled in the fabric of her dress. Then I slip my hand.....

Just then, I am so rudely ripped from my steamy fantasy that I am playing over and over in slow motion in my head. She has just caught me staring at her for a fraction of a few minutes too long.

""Do you like what you see, Colton?""

""See what, Miss Stone?""

""It is Trinity, and you have not had your eyes on the road for the past couple of minutes.""

""I am just wondering how you have managed to give my boys the slip in those.""

""Oh, I can be quite slippery when I want to be.""

""Mmm, I bet that you can.""

With that, my head falls straight into my fantasy of having those legs wrapped around my waist. There is one thing I know for sure, and that is before my babysitting duties are over, I am going to have me a piece of Trinity Stone. But in saying that, if I touch Vic's little princess, I might as well be as good as dead. I value my kneecaps and the part of me that I would like to stick in her mouth. I better get my mind out of the gutter and focus on the job.

""Where am I taking you today, princess?""

""Oh god, please don't call me that; I hate it when father refers to me as his little princess.""

""I said princess, not little princess, and that is exactly what I am going to call you then.""

""Oh, you are one of those that likes grinding ass.""

""Princess, you will know when I am grinding your ass and this, this is not it.""

I get seven sensations of pleasure as I hear her huff, and I know that she is on the brink of throwing a little tantrum. What Trinity Stone does not know is that I am a man of my word. If she as much as winks at a tantrum, I am pinning that ass to a wall.

""Where to, princess?""

""I want to go look for new lingerie.""

...TRINITY POV…

Oh.....Colton Cruz.....

It is easy on the tongue, and I bet you he is just as easy to play with. He is cocky and full of himself, exactly all the ways I do not like my men. And now he has found this new need to call me princess. Well, I know that I am about every fantasy that he has in his head.

Why not play a little game...

""You cannot be serious, princess; your mom said that you had a salon appointment.""

""Oh, I just changed my mind. Don't tell me you have never seen a woman in lingerie before?""

""I am waiting outside; I am not coming in with you.""

""I need someone to tell me if it looks good.""

""Ask the shop assistant; the only thing I know of lingerie is how to take it off.""

""Then maybe...""

""Do not even try to finish that sentence, princess.""

He does not know that I always get my way, and if I need to throw a tantrum, then that is what I shall do. Daddy made him out to be so tough; he is just another boy with a gun and a raging beast. I do not see him last longer than at most three days, and believe me that I will make these three days hell.

""The shop is up on the side here. And you will come in with me.""

""And I said no, did you fail to see the words forming on my lips?""

""No, I was too busy to imagine kissing them.""

""Fuck.""

Ha! He did not see that one coming now, did he? Even though they are tempting, I can only imagine how rough a man like him would kiss. Definitely not the way that I would like to be kissed at all.

""I will come in with you; just do not bring your lips close to me.""

""What is wrong with my lips?""

""Princess, your lips won't know what to do with mine.""

""What is that supposed to mean?""

""I am not your type.""

""And I am not yours either.""

""Keep on telling yourself that.""

(Ugh)

What is wrong with this man? The minute I think I have the upper hand, he comes and says shit like that. Keep telling myself what? What does that even mean?

Let us go for round two then...

""You know that the chairs are in the dressing room?""

""Oh no, you don't, princess. Your father will kill me.""

""Imagine it is a swimsuit.""

""No, not happening. So not happening. Scrap that idea out of your pretty head.""

""Oh, so you think I am pretty?""

""What I think does not matter; I am not watching you getting undressed.""

""But. I. Want. You. To. Come. Inside. With. Me.""

""Oh my god, are you going to throw a tantrum?""

(Oh shit!)

I can remember what he said he is going to do if I throw a tantrum. I am sure that he only joked about it. He is definitely the last man I want to touch me. Who knows his hands, let alone other parts of him was last night.

""No, I am not throwing a tantrum. Can you please come inside with me?""

""Since you are asking so politely, then I will, and it is my job, so I truly do not have a choice.""

…COLTON POV…

Ya...that last bit was perhaps a load of bullshit...

The real reason is that I feel like torturing myself and see that. Oh yes, it will get me into a world of trouble, but I would not be Colton Cruz if trouble were not part of the game.

But let us do get to the part that she is really a spoiled brat. Can something as hot as that really not have a personality? She is as uninteresting as a damn rock. Hey, I guess some people just can't have both.

So yes, now I find myself walking behind little princess and did I forget how damn tight that ass is? Just imagine having that thrown over your lap and spanking that.

""That thing should be spanked.""

She spins around on her heels and faces me.

""What did you say?""

""Nothing. I said, nice shop.""

""Somehow, I don't think so.""

""Hahaha. Princess, I have seen better asses than yours.""

I listen as she grunts and carry walking upstairs into the dressing rooms. The thing though, is that ass is one of the finest I have ever seen.

Then the real fun starts...

I take a seat in the chair that is the furthest away from her, but obviously not far enough. My eyes nearly ball out of my head as she bends forward to takes those red stilettos off. I have all inches of that tightness on display.

""Holy fuck.""

""Did you say something?""

""I said it is hot in here.""

""I will ask them to turn down the heat.""

""Thanks.""

But just keep on bending like that...

I don't quite frankly care if that was on purpose; I enjoyed every part of it. And so does this throbbing, thanks for these little pillows, or I would look like a complete idiot.

Then she disappears into the back and comes out there as if she is floating on air, or maybe that is just my head. There is only one word to describe this, and I am afraid that word does not even exist.

She has pink... I don't know why...but a pink corset on.

Wait...

""Colton, what do you think?""

""You need to be more specific.""

""The color? Do you like it?""

""Please try to be a little more specific.""

""But look, they even have these little strings, if you pull them.....""

""Please don't pull them.""

Oh...if she pulls that, then I am so all over her. A very thankful me sighs relief as she turns around and heads back inside. I think she is doing this on purpose.

Then she comes out with the matching hotpants...well, I thought you do that all at once. But let us not worry about that now, what is the problem is that...that...I don't even know what to call it. They were damn right; all those trips to the salon did her real good.

I need to go to the gents...

""I will be back now.""

I find myself standing in the bathroom, splashing cold water against my burning skin. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life; I don't know why the boys do not want to shadow her. She is a damn pleasure to watch unless if she is about to throw a tantrum.

After several minutes have passed, I make my way back into the dressing room...but wait...it is completely empty.

""Fuck, she gave me the slip. Clever minx.""

I grab my phone from my pocket and check where she is headed. Did she for one second think that she was going to slip away from me? Well, little princess, I was one more clever than you and put a little something into your purse.

She has not gotten far yet; she seems to be just around the corner of the building. I rush on outside and watch as she disappears into the crowd. I let her think that she has gotten away and follow her as she gets lost between the buildings. She is swaying that damn ass so elegantly as she believes that she has successfully given me the slip. Then I pick up my pace, and in seconds I am right behind her.

I reach forward and gently tap her on the shoulder; every bone in my body is getting so much damn pleasure right now.

""Where do you think you are going?""

She spins around, and ya...she has just been caught with her little fingers in the cookie jar.

""Colton!""

""Ya, that is me.""

I step one step closer to her and slowly drive her body back into the wall that has so conveniently presented itself. I hear her gasp...

I press my chest into her...

""What are you doing?""

""I said I am going to pin you to a wall if you throw a tantrum.""

""This is not a tantrum.""

""Oh, to me, it is princess.""

""It is not.""

""Then maybe I am looking for an excuse to do this...""",1,1748611219.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Sheetal Morris,

The story's female lead, She is 22 years old and an exceptional doctor. She has an unknown ability to cure people. She put herself in a lot of danger for her nearly-patient. She is a nice lady with a decent heart. She married her childhood sweetheart. They had been dating for three years and had been married for one year. Her husband is two years her senior. Everyone was impressed with them at college, and some of them were jealous of them as well. But in the end, Sheetal and Daniel were married.

Daniel Morris,

He is twenty-four years old. His height is 6'2"". He is Sheetal's handsome husband. His beautiful eyes, thick black hair, and wide physique are enough to captivate any lady's heart. He had a lot of admirers in college. He just liked Sheetal, although rumors stated that he was a college playboy. He did not pursue a career as a doctor after graduating. He is now a prosperous businessman.

Fareed Shaik,

He is 25 years old. He is 6'4"" tall. He owns his own company and a large worldwide business empire. He is also the son of the Italian mafia, which is a top secret. His blue eyes, slanted nose, black hair, and broad physique are all heart-stopping.

The story begins.

The phone rang.

Sheetal's mother, Ms. Amily, said, ""Sheetal, someone is calling you."" Sheetal answered, ""Yes, mom, I'm coming."" The phone was received by an 18-year-old girl who walked down from her room and said, ""Yes.""

Sheetal's best friend, Henna, said, ""Sheetal, it's me, Henna."" She said over the phone, ""Are you coming tonight?"" ""Noo, you know me right. This is the kind of gathering I hate. I'm sure I'll be bored there, ""I stated. ""Please, Sheetal. Farru is hosting this party in his honor, you know, ""she stated. ""Farru, who is he?"" I asked. Farru is a handsome, arrogant boy, and you don't have to know him, just come with me,"" Henna remarked. ""Henna, but I've never met him. How can I go there? ""I asked. ""You know, Sheetal, you'll never know him. I'm glad you didn't get to meet him. If you did, I'm sure you'd dump Daniel. ""Henna expressed her feelings. I chuckled and replied, ""Thank you, God. I don't know him."" "" Ahh, idiot, listen to me. You are coming okay. And guess what? Daniel will come to pick you up, ""Henna said.

""Did you tell him too, Henna?"" I asked. ""Obviously, I did. Sheetal, you don't know where he belongs. It's a palace in every sense of the word, ""Henna said. She was brimming with enthusiasm, and I could sense it. ""So you're going to see his palace?"" I asked, giggling. ""Bitch, just shut up. I'm obviously going to see him. But I'm not sure if I'll be able to see him or not, ""she stated. ""So, why is he hosting this party?"" I said, rolling my eyes. Henna sighed, ""Sheetal, I simply can't believe you don't know why."" ""This is his last year. That's why he's hosting this party, ""Henna added. ""Is the only reason? Isn't it a little excessive? ""I asked. ""It's his money, and it's his life. Let us enjoy ourselves as well, ""Henna stated her thoughts. She began nagging, ""Now please come,"" she said. ""OK, okay, I'll. Stop it now, ""I said. Henna hung up the phone.

Sheetal's soliloquy.

I honestly don't understand her. She's only going to see him for a few minutes. Who is he, exactly? I don't remember ever seeing him in college.

Sheetal sighed and murmured, ""I still have a lot of reading to do."" I got out of bed and walked straight to the kitchen. While I was preparing coffee, I added, ""Mom, I have a party to attend tonight. Henna invites me. ""

Mom asked, ""Is that her birthday?"" ""No, mom,"" I stated emphatically. What should I say to her right now? ""It's her friend's birthday, Mom. So that's where we'll go. Daniel is also coming to pick me up, ""I said. Mom said, ""So, are you coming home tonight?"" ""Of course, Mom,"" I answered, ""I'll come."" Then Mom responded, ""Okay, then you take the home keys."" I'm thinking about staying at your aunt's place tonight."" I asked, ""Aunt?"" ""Yes, your aunt is a touch under the weather."" ""I'll try to come,"" Mom responded, ""but I'm not sure."" ""It's all right, mama."" You are free to spend the night with her. ""I'll meet her tomorrow if I have the time,"" I said. ""All right,"" she said as she headed to her room.

On the other hand,

Daniel was on the phone with someone. Molly said, ""Daniel, are you coming right?"" He said, ""Yes, I will."" ""I'll wait for you, Daniel."" Molly asked, ""And one thing, are you coming alone?"" ""Obviously not,"" Daniel responded as he switched off the television. ""My babe will accompany me."" ""Daniel, why?"" Molly said. Daniel scowled and asked, ""What exactly do you mean by why?"" ""You know, Sheetal feels uncomfortable at parties like this, so why are you bringing her?"" she asked. ""Do you know what you're saying, Molly? Has she ever said that she dislikes this sort of gathering? Listen, she's my girl. So she needs to accompany me wherever I go, ""Daniel said.

Molly asked, ""Oh really, you didn't bring her when we met up?"" ""Molly, you're becoming quite annoying. I love her, and you are one of my closest friends, ""he explained. So Molly said, ""so whatever we did there wasn't a part of love, Daniel?"" Daniel sighed and expressed his annoyance by saying, ""No, that is not true. Okay, so I didn't force you to do anything. You wanted it as well. ""

""As well as Molly It's only a friend with advantages. As you know, Daniel stated, ""I have a lot of friends like you. Molly said, ""Daniel, I just can't believe you."" ""I know Sheetal is deserving of better. Why don't you abandon her? ""Molly asked fiercely. ""Molly, you know how much I love her. Whatever I do, I'll eventually return to her. She is the love of my life. Please don't try to cause any misunderstandings between us. We have a blind affection for one another, ""Daniel said.

Molly responded, ""Daniel, you are simply unbearable."" ""Molly, you've got to be kidding me. That was a kiss. We merely exchanged kisses. And now you're thinking to yourself, ""I adore you."" It isn't possible. ""I kissed a lot of girls, but it doesn't mean I love all of them,"" he stated.

# Chapter 2

""I kissed a lot of girls, but it doesn't mean I love all of them,"" Daniel stated.

""You know what, everyone was right about you. You're such a jerk. You do not deserve Sheetal, ""Molly said.

""Moll, are you insane?"" I said. ""Everyone knows how much I love Sheetal and how much she means to me. But keep in mind that it was you who requested that I drive you home. I didn't make you do anything, ""I stated. ""Daniel Morris, I hate you. I pray Sheetal ends her relationship with you soon and finds a good man. a liar! ""Molly ended the phone call as she screamed.

I narrowed my eyes and stared at the screen.

Daniel's Aside.

She has no right to curse me.

I screamed and threw my phone on the table. This girl has really ruined my mood. Sheetal is everything to me. I'm sure that she loves me and would never abandon me. When I need anything, Sheetal just knows what to do. She comes to me with it before I even ask for it. I nodded and took my phone, which I unlocked. I smiled as I pressed my fingers across the phone's screen. ""My Sheetal,"" I said quietly.

""I know what color dress you're going to wear today,"" I said as I pulled my black shirt from my cupboard.

The opposing viewpoint.

""Mom,"" I said. I just can't decide which outfit to wear. I sighed and explored my wardrobe. Mom appeared out of nowhere and said, ""What's wrong, honey?""

""I'm sorry, mom, but I'm unable to choose my outfit. Help me to choose, ""I stated. ""You simply pull out your entire outfit, honey,"" mom said as she shifted my clothes to the side.""Yeah, I simply can't decide,"" I said. I sat down on the bed and gazed at her. She began looking for clothes, and after a few moments, she said, ""It's perfect."" I opened my eyes. ""Look at this, honey,"" Mom said.

Mom had just taken out a red frock. I don't wear red very often. ""Mom, I don't like red, you know,"" I said. ""I know,"" Mom remarked, rolling her eyes. ""But that doesn't mean you hate it,"" she added. ""Mom, I stated I didn't like it, so doesn't that mean I hate it,"" I raised my brows and repeated. ""Why is this here if you truly hate it? So that means you don't hate this color too much, ""Mom said. I let out a sigh. Maybe Mom is right; I don't mind this color all that much. Mom immediately caressed my cheek and said, ""Do you know you look like an angel when you wear red?"" I sighed and grabbed the dress from her grip. ""OK, I see what you're saying. ""You don't have to convince me about this right now,"" I remarked as I went to change.

I changed my clothes and checked myself in the mirror. I murmured, ""Yes, it's not awful.""

I emerged from the restroom. ""Look at you, girl,"" mom said, widening her eyes.Tonight, I'm sure no one will be able to take their gaze away from you.""

""Mom,"" I let out and began combing my hair.

Daniel will appear at any time. My phone abruptly began to ring.

""Mom, I think it's Daniel,"" I remarked as I looked at my phone. Daniel was calling me, and I was right. ""Daniel has come, mom. I'm leaving. I love you, I replied, as I kissed her on the cheek and dashed downstairs.

When I came out, I noticed Daniel tapping his phone while leaning against his car. ""Daniel,"" I said, a smile on my face. He smiled at me as soon as he heard me. ""Baby,"" he whispered as he wrapped me in his arms. As he responded, ""I miss you Sheetal,"" he grabbed me up and began spinning me. ""Stop it, Daniel. Mom is keeping an eye on us, ""I burst out laughing. He put me down and gazed out the window. ""Hello, Mrs. Amily,"" he said, waving his hand at my mom.

Mom waved her hand and smiled. ""Let's go, Daniel,"" I said. We got in the car after saying our goodbyes to Mom. I was about to buckle my seatbelt when Daniel grabbed my head and kissed me.

""Mmm,"" I responded, my eyes widening. The kiss was abruptly broken, and he said, ""I missed you. Can't you give me a kiss? "".. I grinned and my eyes narrowed. ""Then why didn't you show up earlier?"" I asked. ""I know how busy you are with your studies. That is why I did not bother you, ""he stated. I grinned and pinched his nose.

Sheetal's Aside.

My boyfriend is rather impressive. I'm really lucky to have him. I took his hand in mine and rested my head on his shoulder. ""Daniel, I'm sorry, but I can't spend so much time with you. I know you want to go out with me, but you're aware of my pressure, ""I said. Daniel kissed my palm and murmured, ""I'm aware, and I'll take you seriously. I'm not in a rush, ""he stated. We exchanged smiles. Daniel instantly frowned and said, ""But wait a moment. What did you choose to wear? ""

I took a close look at his outfit. He was dressed in black, whereas I was dressed in red. I strained my eyes. I said, ""Daniel."" Daniel stated, ""This is our first time."" ""Daniel, I apologize. Mom actually picked my outfit today, ""I said.

Yes, this was the first time we didn't match our outfits. Daniel and I never wore colors that were dissimilar. We wore the same color all the time. How can we possibly make a mistake tonight? It's a type of bond between us. We've never discussed what color we'll wear the next day. However, when we met in college, our outfit colors coincidentally matched. It occurs every time, but today it is different.

Why, God? I bit my lower lip. My eyes are welling up with tears. ""Sheetal, what's the matter?"" Daniel asked. ""I'm sorry, Daniel. I didn't mean to do it. It's entirely my fault, ""I stated.

Daniel put his hand on my cheek and murmured, ""Hey, don't cry. You are not to blame. "" ""No, it's not yours. You expected me to dress in black as well, didn't you? ""I said. ""Sheetal,"" Daniel said as he hugged me.

""It's not your fault, so don't take it to heart. This dress was chosen by your mom, not you. I'm sure you'll pick the black one if you have a choice, ""he stated. ""Are you angry at me?"" I asked, wiping away my tears. He kissed my forehead and said, ""Obviously, I'm not."" ""Don't cry now. We've been here for quite some time. I don't know, maybe my mother-in-law is thinking something romantic about us, ""Daniel said. ""Shut up,"" I smiled as I wiped away my tears."" Daniel began driving with a chuckle. I sat back in my seat and gazed out the window.

That’s when I decided to break up with him. 

We did speak for another 2 weeks where I wanted to give him another chance, however he ended things after that because he said he was never in love and just wanted to give this relationship a shot rationally (idk what that means lol). He said that he doesn’t want to get rid of me and that he does like me a lot as a person but that he needs a cooling off period, we already made a coffee appointment for mid June.

Anyway - this has all now been 3 weeks ago and we had been planning to go to Paris together this weekend, as he spent two years of his life here.

It's like being back in high school, sweating over whether I'll be 'cool' enough. 

The other day, I was getting coffee (my usual caramel macchiato), and I noticed this woman who seemed to be in a similar phase of life as me. We were both engrossed in the same book series, but I hesitated to strike up a conversation. The thought of her brushing me off made my heart race. Eventually, I decided to go for it—if anything, I'd at least gain a funny story worth sharing here, right? 🤷‍♀️

Surprisingly, it turned out really well! We chatted for a while and even exchanged numbers with the possibility of grabbing lunch soon. I'm still not sure if it'll lead to a new friendship, but the experience taught me that confronting the fear of rejection is definitely worth it.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I'm going to stick these identifiers here so that when you see stuff like (mob) and (wh) you'll have some idea of what they are talking about.  I'm not positive about all of these but they're probably pretty close.  If you see anything I've missed or I guessed wrong please let me know.


bb - bed and breakfast?

e - fee exempt

1kz3lt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kz3lt2/14_days_aka_2_weeks_aka_a_fortnight/,14 Days aka 2 Weeks aka a Fortnight,"  Hello decaf community. I am 39 and I have been consuming sodas and chocolate since before i can remember. I started drinking coffee early on, 7th or 8th grade, also Jolt colas (anyone? Jolt cola?) Then the energy drinks came in just in time for college. 

  Well, this caffeine intake became normal for me, coffee in the mornings, more than 8 cups of dark roast. I would follow that up with a few Monster energy tall boys, and then some sodas to taper off until bedtime. Making my daily habit and addiction very tough to give up.

  I started with stopping energy drinks, but this was a financial decision, and i started that as a new years resolution. After getting over working a shift without my precious Monsters I stopped buying sodas too, but this was a diet concern at first. So i was tapering off caffeine a bit even if it wasnt on purpose.

 Flash forward to a couple weeks ago. I sweat a lot, on my head and face always have. Didn't take much to get my sweat on either. I knew i was in for a hot summer this year, and i was particularly tired of sweating so much, especially at work. I last a ton of weight and  thought drinking water in lieu of sodas and Monsters would help my hyperhidrosis, but here comes the heat this year and again sweating too easily. 

  I decided to seek medical advice from a learned doctor and after chatting for a bit, she asked *do you drink coffee in the mornings, if so how much?* 

  With this realization that coffee might be causing me to sweat so much, i decided to crush the last method of caffeine intake i had left, and i quit cold turkey. I bought some maca and ashwagandha chewables, as they are superfoods that help boost natural energy, and i began the struggle of quitting. 

  First two days were a challenge, lethargically dealing with a massive headache between the eyes and foggy minded, i found it to be astonishingly difficult compared to quitting other habits... i just had drank coffee for so long in such a routine way. Then day 3 came and i woke up with a bit more energy than before, and that snowballed daily until I am at a point where i feel as energized after i wake up as i did before after a few cups of coffee. My chronic hyperhidrosis sweating problem, merely a side effect of my coffee habit. 

  I despair at the thought of being addicted to anything. The ball and chains around our ankles, the fear of not being able to satisfy our addictions and breaking a habit. I am very proud of myself for taking back control. These companies that peddle caffeine take advantage of us and they are so widely accepted that no one debates the morality of them. Water for Free.

1kz3lan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1kz3lan/seriously_how_do_you_guys_get_dates_been_to/,"Seriously, how do you guys get dates? Been to therapy, hit the gym, got my life together — dating still feels out of reach.","**A little backstory:**

I dropped out of high school at 15 after falling into depression. I had a girlfriend in my final year — we were together for about a year and sexually active — but I haven’t had any romantic or intimate experiences since. Not even a date.

After a failed apprenticeship, I spent five years as a NEET — smoking weed, gaming, isolating myself in my room, and doing very little else.

Eventually, I pulled myself out. I enrolled in college and completed one year of mandatory military service (I’m from Europe). Now I’m almost 28 and in my 4th semester studying mathematics at university.

**Things are going pretty well overall:**

* I’ve kept a close friendship with someone I’ve known since high school — we meet weekly.
* I’m close with my sister, and we see each other regularly.
* I have one uni friend I eat lunch with occasionally.
* I’ve been going to the gym 2–4 times a week for the past four years — I’m in great shape.
* I’m 1.81m (5'11”), average-looking, dress well enough, and take care of my grooming.
* I meditate regularly (thanks, Dr. K).
* I started salsa dancing a year ago and genuinely enjoy it.
* I’ve worked hard on my social skills and made huge progress.
* Therapy helped me process my NEET years, and six months ago I was diagnosed with autism — which explained a lot about my past.

**Now to the point:**

**How and where do you guys meet single women to go on dates?**  
I feel like I’ve tried everything and I’m getting nowhere.

**Here’s what I’ve tried in the past year:**

**Dating Apps:**  
I used them for 6 months but got few matches. Most ghosted or unmatched me after just a few messages. One woman agreed to a date, but canceled two days before and ghosted me.  
I could’ve probably put more effort into taking better photos — mine weren’t just mirror selfies and I genuinely thought they looked fine, but maybe they didn’t stand out enough.  
Eventually, I deleted Tinder — it just crushed my self-esteem.

**Hobbies (Salsa):**  
I met a woman I really liked through salsa. After salsa class, we talked a bit, and I asked her out for coffee. She said that if it was meant to be a date, she wasn’t interested — she’s looking for someone who shares her religious beliefs.  
I also met another woman at salsa I liked, but she was already in a relationship.

**Events:**  
I went to two university-organized speed-dating events.

* At the first, I matched with someone and we agreed to go on a date — she canceled the day before and ghosted.
* At the second, I didn’t match with anyone, even though I had some good conversations.

**In Person:**  
I’ve only approached someone once — a woman smiled at me in an ice cream shop, I struck up a short conversation and asked for her number. She was friendly but said she was already seeing someone.

**Despite everything I’ve worked on, I still can’t seem to get a single date — and I honestly don’t understand why.**

I don’t think I come off as creepy or too strong — if anything, it's probably the opposite. I’m introverted (and autistic, lol), so social interaction doesn’t come naturally, but I’ve improved immensely.  
I’ve worked so hard to turn my life around. But when it comes to dating — actually meeting women who are single *and* interested — it still feels just as out of reach as during my NEET years.

I know I have good qualities — I’m fit, intelligent, kind, truthful, helpful, and loyal. At the same time, I realize autism might cause me to come across as emotionally flat, distant, or disinterested — even when I’m fully present and genuinely invested. I often wonder how much that affects first impressions, especially in social settings like salsa or speed dating.

I struggle most with picking up subtle cues or knowing when it’s okay to escalate — like turning a friendly conversation into flirtation (if I even knew how that worked). I also worry that I come across as too reserved to make my romantic intentions clear.

I’m not looking for casual hookups. I want something meaningful — ideally a long-term relationship.

**What am I not seeing?**

**What else can I improve?**

I’m open to any kind of advice — whether it’s practical tips, mindset shifts, or things I might be missing about how I come across.

but if he had to have a favorite food (or drink) that he gravitated towards, what do you think it'd be? 

for me personally, i think he'd be very selective with things like wine, coffee, or tea, but one of his guilty pleasures is like a nice crepe or something sweet from a local cafe haha. i think he'd like to dine at more highly rated and upscale restaurants for dinner, but he also occassionally loves the quiet comfort/finds peace in the simplicity of a cozy cafe that's just down the street",56,1748609909.0,MonsterAnime,27,1.0,False
1kz3imb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_raijnesart/comments/1kz3imb/last_year_i_launched_a_diy_media_cult_this_year/,"Last year I launched a DIY media cult. This year it continues, join us, help us make cool stuff...","In 2024, I kicked off \*Greenscreen Commune\* — a handmade creative ecosystem built around weird fiction, CC-BY art, FMV games, grimy zines, and lo-fi machinima. It started with a Discord, a Patreon, and a weird little world stitched from VHS static, psychodrama, and punk ethics.

T​his year, I’m growing it while launching the next layer: \*\*Synaptext\*\* — a micro-studio for awkward tools, poetic prototypes, and interface experiments.
Our first two products are:
🛠 \*\*Mecha Muse\*\* – A mech-hand dev toy where you mine and sort beads using robotic tweezers. There’s no audio. No instructions. It’s deliberately janky. Built to teach patience, chaos, and precision. Think tactile meditation meets failed cybernetic dream.
💾 \*\*Holotank\*\* – A tactile prototype inspired by hologram chess (like Dejarik in \*A New Hope\*) but reimagined as a coffee table arcade console. Cocktail cabinet meets failed future.
Each comes with its own behind-the-scenes zine—documenting the build, the bugs, the philosophy, and our love for interfaces that break more than they work.


Meanwhile, under my pen name \*\*Polydina Flynt\*\*, I’m finishing:


\* A novel about time theft, interdimensional dragons, and the military-industrial horror of memory itself. \* A trilogy of zines about nerd culture, cult cinema, punk publishing, and script-style fiction with chiller vibes. \* A body horror screenplay being adapted as an FMV game for Steam. \* Two graphic novel series + a lore drop for the world that connects them. \* An animated series made in Moho, titled \*This Is Not Pornography\*. \* A lo-fi mod of Marvel’s \*Overpower\* CCG with homebrew rules + Instagram play. \* Five theatre scripts. \* A series of short stories (body horror/grimdark). \* An open-source horror-comedy anthology film. \* A micro-budget theatrical drama feature film.
\* Free prop cartoon drops based on unadapted novels. \* A one-shot TTRPG release with rules, world, and origin story included.
Most of this is CC-BY or open-source via the Greenscreen Commune Patreon. Some of it is meant to glitch. Some of it just does.


If you’re into:
\* Unpolished but passionate tools \* Storytelling through UI \* Zines that feel like error logs \* Games that confuse more than they reward \* Or weird creative ecosystems that won’t try to sell you NFTs...
Then you’re invited.

\*\*About Me (if you’re curious):\*\*
I’m Polydina Flynt — writer, zine-maker, world-builder, glitch romantic. I’ve been taking creative losses for three decades — burnout, breakdowns, reboots. I dropped out of high school in ’98, worked loading trucks, got bored enough to go to a careers expo, and discovered TV, theatre, and radio. That led me to Aoraki Polytechnic. Then eight years of drifting. Then I got serious again. I earned two degrees and never stopped building stories.


I write novels. I make games. I sketch punk theatre. My TV pilot got a callback from TVNZ. My stage-play \*Speaker for Hal\* earned a mentorship with author Barbara Else.
I grew up on the PlayStation 1. That was my cathedral. My sacred junkyard. \*Skullmonkeys, Kula World, Syphon Filter, Discworld 2, Twisted Metal, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, Tenchu, Carmageddon, Loaded, No fear Downhill, Alien Trilogy, MK Trilogy, MGS\*… They didn’t just entertain — they shaped how I tell stories.
Add in the Mega Drive, the C64, the Amiga 500, the Master System, and (yes) the Atari Jaguar — and you start to understand why my work leans into weirdness, brutality, play, and memory.


Now based in Wellington, I’m running Greenscreen Commune and Synaptext as dual arms of a single vision: storytelling as ecosystem, design as poetry, failure as philosophy.
Mecha Muse launches in September, alongside a new zine and at least one novel.
Thanks for reading. If any of this speaks to you — join us.

Hindi ko alam kung mababasa mo ‘to, at baka hindi mo rin alam kung gaano ka kahalaga sa buhay ko. Pero gusto kong subukang ilabas ang matagal ko nang hindi masabi—salamat.

Salamat sa mga kwentuhang nagsimula lang sa simpleng pagkapagod, pero nauwi sa malalim na pagninilay sa buhay. Salamat sa pagtanggap mo sa mga kwento ko, kahit magulo, kahit paulit-ulit, kahit minsan hindi ko rin maintindihan ang sarili ko. Hindi mo ako pinilit umayos, hindi mo ako ginamot—pinakinggan mo lang ako nang buong-buo.

Naalala mo ba nung nagpunta tayo sa kapehan sa Antipolo? Sobrang trapik pa nun dahil sa aksidente sa daan, pero kahit delayed ang lahat, parang sakto pa rin ang timing ng lahat ng napag-usapan natin. Isa ‘to sa mga gabing tahimik ang paligid pero malalim ang ingay sa loob ko—at dahil nando’n ka, hindi ako natakot pakinggan ‘yung ingay na ‘yon.

Tumatak sa akin yung mga kwento mo—yung gap sa lipunan na nararamdaman mo kahit sa mga lugar kung saan dapat lahat ay pantay; yung panalangin na kahit hindi perpekto, basta totoo ay sapat na sa Diyos; at yung desisyong gawing simple ang buhay kahit may option kang maging maluho. Parang sa bawat salita mo, napapaisip ako: ""Puwede palang mabuhay nang ganito ka-kalma pero ganito ka-totoo.""

At nung ako na ‘yung nagsalita, hindi mo ako kinwestyon. Hindi mo ako kinonsol. Tinanggap mo lang. At sa mundong puro panghuhusga, ‘yon ang pinakamalaking regalo—yung kaibigan na hindi kailangang magtanong kung bakit ganito ako, kasi niyakap na niya kung sino ako.

Hindi mo man mabasa ‘to, sana maramdaman mo kung gaano ako nagpapasalamat. Hindi sa mga payo mo, kundi sa presensya mong hindi kailangang magpanggap, hindi kailangang laging may sagot. Sa’yo ko natutunan na may mga kaibigang hindi lang dumadaan sa buhay mo para dumaan—may mga dumarating para patibayin ka.

Salamat sa’yo. Sa pagiging safe space. Sa pagiging totoo.

There were 3 panel members, judge, a doctor and a health professional. No one from DWP turned up. 

It was a long hearing, they started with questions around daily living aspects. I found the questions really triggering, I'm not going to lie, it was not a gentle hearing. I could feel myself getting mentally tired and I didn't have an answer to some of the more nuanced/complex questions. The panel took a break, I went to use the loo and then had a massive panic attack. I did manage to go back in but I said please, will this take much longer as I can't handle the questions etc. I was in tears and i felt ashamed. They asked me a few more things then said they would award me the daily living part, they wanted to discuss the mobility part in private and said I could wait for the outcome outside or wait for letter. At this point I was dissociating so I said I'd just like to go home, thanked them for their time and left. My partner met me afterwards and we went for a debrief coffee. The clerk saw me sitting on the steps and came out and said they also awarded me the mobility part too.

This has been SUCH a long and drawn out process as I applied last April.

I want to do a longer post with explanations and examples of the questions etc but for now I'm resting. I thought I'd feel relief, but I honestly don't know how to feel. I'm so glad I didn't give up.

One night, after spending what felt like hours scrolling, I decided enough was enough. It was affecting my sleep and my morning vibe. The endless cycle of negativity was defo not the way I wanted to start or end my day.

So, I tried leaving my phone across the room at night and swapped the morning scroll session with some light stretching and a cup of coffee on the balcony, just letting my mind wake up naturally. It's amazing how much calmer and more focused I am now. I don't immediately go into panic mode with world news or unrealistic Insta feeds.

**December 28**

Connie walks in and her soft wind chimes sound. It ends with a flourish, and the flourish sounds like my theme. A few people besides us notice. She comes up for her Tea and sits with Heca, Beth, and Todd.  They start chatting and I continue my work with the line. It is a busy day, so it takes me close to a half-hour to get time to go talk to her.

“Hey Connie, do you have time to talk about something that I promise isn’t bad after my shift?”

She nods and smiles. “For you, my lady, of course.”

I roll my eyes and wink at her before I go. I can hear Todd say to her “Like you would be able to refuse a summons from her…”

She shushes him.

 

**Later that night**

It is 6 pm. I am dead tired. Doesn’t matter.  I have time before the bus.  Even if I didn’t, I need to do this.  I take a breath and go talk to Connie. She is by her tree playing a flute. She has a hat out along with a notice that the owner of the business she is at allows her to perform here.  She doesn’t need a permit or permission technically, but it has lowered the number of issues with some overly aggressive police and I was more than happy to provide it for her months ago.  There’s quite a bit of cash there.  She is leaning against the new section of fence I had put in to replace the damaged section.  One of my worst moments was here. 

As a reminder of something terrible, it had to go.  I walk up and she looks down.  Her eyes look at the spot where she had held Jackie’s wound closed.  I see so much pain.

“I didn’t actually check on you properly after the whole car ordeal. That is something I should have done. I am so sorry.  You look like you are still hurting and have some trauma from this. Believe me, I know you can’t just bottle it up and never show it.”

She nods. Tears are falling from her cheeks silently. “Jackie literally died to save me and my tree. I was covered in her blood. My tree’s roots drank deeply of that same blood. She gave this tree even more life than just saving us.  How can I face her?”

“Is that why you vanish when she shows up?  You need to stop it. She didn’t save a friend to lose them to guilt. She did it because she couldn’t stand the thought of losing you.  Do we need to see about getting you a therapist?  Can you afford one?”

She nods. “I am starting to work with one of the other Fae that has training with this sort of thing. Dryads face our mortality more than the eternal ones, so we need tools to handle it and there are those who help.  I do want to thank you for caring about me, my lady.”  Her shoulders straighten. She seems to be less worried.  “Is this what you wanted to speak to me about, my lady?”

“No. It is the chime and the whole my lady thing. What is going on there?”

Her shrug is frustrating. “I don’t know about the chime. I heard Jackie had your chime for a few days and now it is a new one for her that also has some of your theme in it. Perhaps mine will follow suit as we are both yours?”

“You are not mine.” 

She shakes her head vigorously and almost pleads with me. “Please don’t say such things. In this place, with your power, it could kill me.”

My look of shock must be evident. “I take it back.”

She nods and continues.  Her smile is a way of thanking me.

“You own this land, the CaFae is your domain. I am bound to it. I am bound more than once. You own the tree, and by Fae tradition, me, technically. You saved my tree and thus, my life.  Then Jackie saved my life.  I owed her my life and I was attempting to save her life to return the favor but could not.” Her eyes looks so much in pain.

“You, my mistress and friend, stepped in and saved her when I could not. YOU repaid MY debt. I owe you that life.  I am thrice bound to you. As such, I am now yours, forever.”

I look at her and something clicks.  “Is that why you showed Ricardo your true form?”

“Absolutely.  That incident was before the collision.  Even then, I considered you my lady.  Then, as now, if you ask me for anything, I will perform it to the best of my abilities.  As he is your current paramour, I didn’t think he would take advantage of the situation as you do not suffer those that would such acts.  I knew he was curious and that he didn’t grasp the full implications.  So innocent…  He has apologized. I can’t believe he got me a card that said he was ‘Sorry for being an idiot and asking for a lewd moment.’ Who makes those cards?!”

I laugh. Of course he found one like that.  Such a great guy.

She gets a hug. I have no choice. She needs one and I need one as well.

“Do you also wish to see my true form?  It won’t be the first time, but I have seen yours and it is truly worthy of the term majestic.”

Huh?  “My true form?”

The look of shock on her face tells me she just told me something important by mistake.

She remains silent and starts looking away.

I grab her chin and pull it back to have her face me.  “Please do explain, Connie.”

She bows her head in defeat. “Yes, my lady. When you were blessed by the third of the three queens you came into your full power and your core became manifest. We call that a true form.”

“Hold up. I thought THIS is my true form.” I am pointing at me.

She places a hand on my chest. “This is a vessel for all mortal’s true forms. Their cores. Within every human is one. It is their true being.”  Her hand lightly traces two fingers up my neck and then she places a tender hand on my cheek.  “The angels and devils call them souls.  We can see their core at all times when we look at mortals. The shell around it can be beautiful, but if the core is rotten, we are not attracted to them.”

She pauses to make sure I understand the gravity of her next sentence.  “We all find you beautiful.  Flawed, damaged, and yet shining bright in spite of the pain we see etched upon you.”  She gives me a sad smile. I don’t know how to deal with this.  I wait and she continues to explain it to me.

“Your core responded to the pact you made with us and the blessings you have been given as a result, my lady.” *And you are so very gorgeous, cracks and all.*

Something that has been bugging me for a bit shows up. “Connie, I can hear what you all refer to as broadcasts.”

She blushes and looks down at her feet.  “You heard that?”

“Yes.”  I nod. “But the thing is, I can’t tell who is doing it. In a room with 3 people and me, I can hear them clear as day but they all come to me in my own voice. I never know who is doing it. How can all of you tell them apart?”

Her shocked look speaks volumes. “I assume the other Fae hear them as I do. In the voice of the person speaking. That is an interesting quirk. I don’t think it is an external one. I am not an expert in such things.  But I believe you will get the voices correctly once you have accepted yourself for who you are.  You must accept all of yourself if I am right, my lady.”

“So why do you keep calling me your lady, really?”  This is all too much. I don’t know if I can handle it.

She smiles and takes my hand. “Here, in this place, you hold power rivaling the queens of a court. Here you are an ArchFae that is also a mortal. More importantly, you are a lady. You care for all of us.  And I, being tied to you both in a life bond, the bond of debt for a life bond, and for living within your domain, am yours.  Mind, soul, and body.” 

With that she drops her glamour and I see her again in her full glory. Though she has changed some. Her branches have the same pine needles she sported before.  Now the bark is denser, and her face more beautiful than before. Her proportions are very much that of a nymph and her beauty is enough to break a mortal man.  And beyond all that beauty, her eyes are lit up by green fire.

*Well holy fuck! She is gorgeous.  Absofuckinglutely gorgeous.*

*And I’m like 68… okay 67% straight now…?*

She smiles at me. “If the lady so wished it, I would gladly help you make that only 50% straight.”

*Fuck…*

*66.6%*

 

 

**December 28**

Tailor walks out of Jackie’s room as I am getting ready for work. He is wearing just boxers. He waves at me. He is looking around for something.  I stare. What the fuck?

Cindy walks out of the room in a button-down flannel shirt that is obviously not hers.

“Oh, there it is!”  He starts pulling the shirt off her and I am left with a nice sight. Also, it is cold. And Cindy is feeling it.  The piercings don’t show different, but the goosebumps don’t lie.

Jackie seems annoyed. I know I am.  “Be a fucking gentleman and give her the shirt back, Tailor. Jesus. Treat a woman right!” Jackie’s anger gets his attention.  And yet…

“I thought I did last night.”  He laughs and puts the shirt back on Cindy. She is thankful for the extra warmth.

I stare at him. “Never be selfish to people that put part of your anatomy inside their own. Best case scenario you don’t get to use that part with them again…”

He shrugs. 

“Worst case scenario it gets bitten off.”  I make a loud bite noise.  Cindy shows him all her teeth and does so as well.  He flinches.

I finish my coffee and smile while Jackie gives me a wink.

Tailor has been here twice now. Always with Cindy. I think both she and Jackie are worried he might disrupt their thing. I also think he isn’t good enough for my girls.  He does seem a little selfish to be good at this with them. Oh well, not my circus, not my monkeys.

 

**December 31**

Cindy has been walking around the house in nearly gossamer thin t-shirts and equally risqué panties since Jackie’s parents left.  I think she is trying to tempt me.  I know Ricardo has been admiring her pretty openly of late. Can’t blame him. Woman is almost as stunning as Jackie. She also mentioned a threesome again. Ugh. *She is super cute, but I am dating Ricardo and I am not going to risk hurting him to get in on that.*

Wait, why did I just think about it like that?  Fucking Jackie messes with me so much I am starting to be open to the possibility. 

Down to maybe 65% straight now if my fantasies are an indicator.

Why am I fantasizing about her or Cindy almost as much as Ricardo when he is not around?

The Fae damsels hitting on me have also not helped.  Connie has outright asked for a ‘session of sheer bliss’ in my office after our “you own me” discussion.  Naughty wood nymph. 

*Mainly it is Jackie tho. I have been fantasizing about her when she wears those outfits a bit too much lately. Damn woman is slowly turning me bi.* *Sometimes I wanna call her bluff, throw her on my bed, and spend hours licking her from ears to toes.*

I bet she would be doing a villainous laugh and saying “just as planned!” right now if she knew…

Speaking of Jackie, the klutz drops her glass of water.  I wonder if we should get her some screening to see if this was caused by the accident? She has been dropping things a lot lately.

Cindy sees me heading to the shower and waves.  I wave back and say, “Hey sweetie. Staying tonight?”

“Not sure yet. Hoping.”  I am always happy to see her, so I smile and give her a wink.

A quick shower later and I am heading for my room in a towel when I hear the little snake I call a roommate run up behind me and grab my towel. She yanks it off in a swift motion and runs passed me into the living room before I can grab her. “Naked Amazon on display!!!”  Her mirth is almost infectious.  Still.

“Jackie, give me back my tow..el…er... oh hi Ricardo…  I take it you came in when I was showering?”

He is just looking at me from the couch and smiling. He is obviously happy to see me. More to the point, his body is definitely happy as I can see the reaction from here. As can Jackie. 

Cindy most definitely can since she is sitting next to him and staring at his crotch.

“Cindy, stop staring at his baseball bat!”  I am laughing while also wondering how to get my towel back gracefully.  It is getting cold and I am a bit nipply.

She nods and looks at me.  She makes a motion with her hands. I laugh. I make it the correct size which is bigger. She laughs. “You could club baby seals with that thing…” Jackie and I just snicker at that comment.  Cindy stops staring at him and now my cheeks get flushed as she finally notices I am naked and is now leering at me.  Her eyes refuse to stay put on any one part and while it is complimentary, I feel like this is full on lust.

Ricardo finally comes out of what can only be called a naked Amazon induced fugue state and realizes what we are saying. The cute and far too slow man covers his crotch with a pillow.  Jackie walks up behind him on the couch, throws my towel on his face and says “man’s basically been living with two horny exhibitionists and a goddess he fucks on the regular for months now and he didn’t realize we all have seen every erection?  And buddy, there have been a lot.”  She giggles at his blushing reaction.

“Cindy’s lacy thongs have been a very good producer of them.”  Jackie kisses him on the cheek, winks and laughs as he attempts to hit her with my towel.  I walk up and grab it.

“May I please continue to dry off?  You know what, fuck it.  Ricardo, wanna help me?”  I drop the towel and wink while walking into my room without looking back. I try that sashay Jackie is so fond of doing. I hear someone choking on their drink. I can also hear him leap over the couch to chase me. 

It is going to be a great New Years. I may even be in the living room for it.

Probably not…

**(Morgan Freeman voice: She was not.)**

 

**Jan 4th**

“I just don’t like it!”  Ricardo raises his voice to me for the first time ever.

“No, I… okay. Let’s talk here. You are upset, and it isn’t about the how I do my laundry.”  I look at Ricardo and I am wondering what is going on.  This is very out of character for him. He isn’t really like this often if ever.

“You have Jackie’s clothes in your pile again.  I know she and Cindy have an open thing…” he looks… jealous?  Does he think I am cheating on him with Jackie?  I can’t even begin to describe how much trouble that would cause. Cindy is also the one that is harassing me the most, if I am being honest.

That slob is making him hurt. Bad Jackie. “Yes, I do have her clothes in my basket. She is a slob. You have seen her have clothes trail her like a contrail following a jetliner. I pick up, unlike her. Sometimes I have her clothes.” 

“You do leave my place cleaner than when you got there, like some cleaning fairy.”  He seems less annoyed. He is working it out. Such a great guy. He is going to make some woman happy someday.

*Why did I think of it in those terms?*

I move and kiss him, gently.  “Darling, she has Cindy, and I have you.  I am happy with this.” 

*Quit lying.*    Who said that?

He laughs a little at that. “Are you sure? She really makes you happy. More than I ca…” My mouth stops his dumb statement.

“Yes.  I am sure. The redhead may be my best friend, but she isn’t my boyfriend.” Something is bothering him. He will tell me when he is able. My dad taught me to be patient with people working things out. I can tell he is trying to do so.  I have a feeling this isn’t about Jackie though.

We head upstairs and go into the apartment.  We meet with a path of clothes that has two bras leading to Jackie’s bedroom. “Cindy must be here…”.

He laughs.  “Yea, I am an idiot. I am not sure why I didn’t think about the clothes thing from events like this…”

We both laugh. I grab all the clothes on the floor and pile them by her door. I also put her newly cleaned clothing in a separate pile and then go to sit next to Ricardo.

He looks at me and obviously works up some courage.  “I haven’t ever asked.  Where are you from?” HERE IT IS!  He is looking at me like he is hoping for a bunch of info. I know so much about him. I have met some of his family, I know he is from Aquadilla in Puerto Rico. He has dozens of cousins, a mom, 3 sisters and his brother. Most of his extended family is still there. He lost some when Maria hit. He left the island then as he needed to make more money to send home. He moved his mom to Connecticut a couple of years ago. I know he is in IT and makes good money. Something to do with networks and security.  I don’t get it when he gets technical.  He is sweet and just gives me the layman’s version. Meanwhile, he knows my name and things from the last 5 years or so. Nothing else.

“Augusta, Georgia.  I lost most of the accent over the first 2 years here. I have always been good at picking up accents.”

He nods.  “You started talking with a Spanish accent when you met my cousins.”

“Not my intention. Happens. So, I lived in Georgia until I was 20.  Want the good stuff?  I wink at him. He nods.

I like him. He is kind and sweet and should know this. He’s told me a bunch. “I was a tall and lanky tomboy. I am still murderous in volleyball and basketball. I also lost my virginity at 17 on May 29^(th) to my high school sweetheart exactly 1 month after my father died.”  I see him figure out what day my dad died.  He starts holding back tears.  Ugh. Don’t need your pity, sweet man.

“His parents and my mother forced us to get married when they found out.”  *I was pregnant.  Don’t mention that, he doesn’t need to know about Riley.*  “I got divorced at 20.  Moved here the same day it got finalized. Been here 1/5^(th) my life now. Wouldn’t trade it for anything.  Even the roaches.”  He doesn’t need to know I am damaged goods. Doesn’t need to know my greatest failures, my fears.  Arms length. Like everyone else… *everyone but her.*

I almost pass out from the hold he has on me.  I left a lot out, but we can go over that in time. Better to not deal with it right now. *If ever.*

He traces a finger along my scar.  “And this?”

“Story for another time.  I am enjoying the hugs and that will kill the mood.”

Cindy comes out in what looks like just a night shirt, sees us and damn near cheers. She comes over and hugs us both.  I note she has some sheer panties on that were not covered by the shirt and damn if it isn’t all on display.  The shirt is just there to tease, really. We are both getting a hell of a show. I am not sure which of us is enjoying it more.  Dammit. 

I blame Jackie…

She then goes to the kitchen and starts making snacks.  This entails a lot of bending over.  She talks to us.  “Staying tonight?”  The question was not directed at me.

He nods. “Yep.”  Both seem really happy the other is here.

These two get along. Makes me happy. I use ASL with him.  “You going to tell her she is showing off her landing strip and even more when bending over?”   He laughs and signs back, “I want to live.  She would kill me.”

“So, you are just going to enjoy the show every time she bends over?”  I think Cindy caught on we are having a convo in ASL.  He laughs again. Cindy is eyeing us.

“In my defense, I mean, yea.  It is a really good show,” he signs back.

I make a mock shocked face and Cindy then signs to both of us “Damn right it is.”

We both stare in horror as she walks back to Jackie’s room and Jackie is too busy laughing to say anything to us. I then remember her signing with Fiadh at the shop months ago. Fuck.

 

**Jan 5.** 

I pick up the phone, “Hey Mary, did the presents arrive okay?”

Mary is smiling, I can hear it. “Hey Guardian Momma. Yea. The presents got here in time for Christmas. And we just opened her birthday present. There is a party. It is a princess theme.  Before you ask, we got video if you want it. Will attach it to the e-mail along with some pics I am sending right…now.”

She continues and I see an alert for my mailbox.  “I know you said you can’t stand to see videos and pictures are all you can manage, but I am hoping this one will be okay.”

“I… will think about it. God Mary, I am such a coward. I know she is happy there. I just don’t want to hear her voice because that makes it too real. You still calling me guardian momma to her?”

Mary doesn’t hesitate. “You protected her from abuse. You saved her life at the cost of your own pain.”

I choke down a gasp.  How does she know? 

“Don’t think I don’t know. Matt is a hell of a sleuth. He talked to David at the ‘David’s Diner’ years ago. We know.”  Oh, David snitched.  Well, he did save my life in more ways than one.  I can forgive him.

“Mary, never tell her about that, please.”

I know this woman, I know it is futile. I still hope to spare Riley that info about her sperm donor.

“Too late. She knows about her guardian momma and how…”  Mary pauses.  I can hear her choking up.  Dammit Mary, I already love you, don’t cry for me. 

“Pat. She loves you. Us too.  You can always visit.”

I mute the phone. I can’t have this woman hearing me falling apart. I can’t have her hear my anguish.

I gave birth to that little angel while I had three cracked ribs. The ribs were the price I paid to keep him from kicking my stomach. My little girl.  I didn’t want to lose my little girl. She came early thanks to that bastard doing that. 

I also didn’t want to give her up. I held her in my arms. I gave her milk. I did so knowing these wonderful people would take her from me a few days later. I kept my husband away from her. All for her.  I couldn’t let her be hurt.

I have the drawing they sent when she was 4. Her family. A tall woman with dark hair in the background that looks like an angel with the words garden momma above me. Guardian is a tough word.  Such a great girl.  I can’t hurt her by showing up. I am a phantom. Better that way.

“Thank you.”  That’s all I can manage to say between the sobs.  She can hear them, I am sure.

I hate this. I hate my stupidity, my weakness. I gave my baby up, and it was the best fucking thing I ever did in my pathetic life…

“Please watch the video, Patricia. And don’t worry. We will protect your little angel.”

I shake my head. “No, she is your angel. She has a great mom. I am so glad I chose you both and that you chose her. She is in a loving home. Her home.  Your home.”

I fight back a sob and compose myself a little.  She needs to know I mean this.  “Love you, super momma, thank you again for saving your daughter, my baby.”

She’s crying.  “Thank you for giving us our daughter.  Our wonderful Riley.”   

I lose it.

“I need to go, I am not…  I am sorry.”

She rushes before I can hit the end call button.  “Don’t be a stranger.” 

“Ok.”  I hang up. 

I look at my e-mail.  There it is.

I stare at the video’s icon.  For minutes I debate deleting the e-mail.  Not seeing it.  Not making her any more real.  Not making the pain worse. 

No.

Fuck I am weak. I have to hear her, just once.

I start the video. A bunch of girls wearing princess outfits are singing happy birthday. Riley is gorgeous. She is laughing and blows out the candles.

There is a cut. She is opening my present. I was told she was big into princesses. I sent her a She-Ra sword. Hehehehe. She squeals with happiness.

Mary laughs and Mike says “We should have guessed.”  Some girl asks who it is from and she says “my guardian mom.  She protected me before I was born and even gave me to mom and dad.”  A couple girls look like they just figured it out. The rest just nod.

Riley looks at the camera. “Thank you for being my guardian. I know you will never stop. I will learn to protect myself so you can have breaks.  Love you garden momma.” 

*She’s fucking perfect.  I made her. My angel.*

*I made her and I fucking let her go and it was the right thing to do and I still hate myself.*

I am sobbing into my pillow when a light knock on my door gets my attention.  I close the laptop immediately.

I get quiet. Maybe she won’t press it?

The door opens. “Pat?” Jackie is wearing something decent and has a pillow with her.

I look up.  She sees me looking like a wreck, makes a noise and comes over.

Without any hesitation my best friend is holding me and making comforting noises. Rocking me.  Telling me I will be okay.

I won’t be.  But I let her convince me a little bit.

I cry myself to sleep in her arms.

1kz36ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1kz36ew/aomori_2_days_trip_report/,Aomori 2 Days Trip Report,"Summary
Spent 2 nights 3 days in Aomori
Flew in from JFK to Haneda
Took train to Aomori 
Stayed at Relabo

Day 1 Airport to Aomori (~4.5 - 5hrs)

Flight from JFK to Haneda (NH159) arrived around 5:15 am

Part 1: Airport to Tokyo station (~30-40in)
Leg 1
Line: Tokyo Monorail
From Haneda Airport Terminal to Monorail Hamamatsu-cho (last stop)

Leg 2
Hamamatsu-Cho to Tokyo station 
Line: JR Yamanote 
From Hamamatsu-Cho to Tokyo station

Notes: Was a quick and easy ride with our two suitcases.  Yamanote line was not crowded since it was before rush hour.  

Part 2: Tokyo Station to Aomori station (~3hr 45min)
Leg 1
Line: JR Tohoku Shinkansen
From Tokyo Station to Shin Aomori station 

Leg 2
Line: JR Ou Line
From Shin Aomori station to Aomori station

Notes:  We arrived to Tokyo station before 7am.  Bought our tickets at the midori no mado guchi.
I would recommend double checking if you need a limited express train ticket to board the Shin Aomori to Aomori leg.  
There aren’t much stores open before 7am, but the eki ben spots are open! We got our bentos to eat on the Shinkansen.

Part 3: Aomori Station area

We arrived at 11:30 am ish.
We  were staying at the Relabo hotel.  It’s right at the train station so quite convenient.  It’s a newer hotel and they do have a few English speaking staff to help navigate things. We dropped off our luggage at the hotel to explore.  
Check in was at 3pm but they were kind enough to arrange an earlier check in (2pm).

We wanted to go to the Aomori Gyosai Center but it was closed on Tuesdays!!! So we decided to explore instead. 

Recommended spots:

Nebuta museum
Pretty cool cultural venue!

MIA coffee roasters
Try their homemade custard pudding

Chokotto (dinner)
Sake and sashimi spot
It’s a cute 6 person ish counter spot with the chef making food
You do get charged tourist price but the sashimi is great and the sake is amazing.
Ask for the dashi maki tamago if available. The eggs are legit orange!

Relabo hotel
Super clean and modern
Try their private onsen gig
You can choose either 50 min (was like 8,800yen) or 90min

Day 2: Aomori Gyosai Center, Hirosaki Castle, Shin Aomori 

Breakfast at Aomori Gyosai Center (7:30)

Short walk (less than 10min) from the hotel.
We tried the nokkedon by purchasing tickets (cash only).  We got the 12 tickets each for 2,200yen per person.  You basically walk around the stalls and exchange toppings for the tickets you purchased.   It was good fun! Don’t forget to get the miso soup and grilled scallops!

Apart from the seafood, the apple juice vendor is next level.  He was generous with samples and we tried a few.  We ended up buying two the first day, and came back for six the next day!

Definitely recommend the experience!  They’re open from 7am til 4pm.  Closed on Tuesdays.

Hirosaki Castle (noonish)

Line: JR Ou Line
From Aomori station to Hirosaki station 
(~35min)

We walked from Hirosaki station to the castle.
(40 min)
Out journey took too long.  I’ll spare you the details. 

Shin Aomori
Line: JR Ou line
From Hirosaki station to Shin Aomori station
(~30min)


San nai Maruyama Iseki
Cabbed it from the station (~15min)
This was a super cool archeological site!  It’s a museum as well and tells the history of the region.  Definitely would recommend it!

Aomori Art Museum
Walked from San nai to the art museum.
It took about 20min and we got a bit lost.
The museum was really good.  The Aomori Ken was interesting…. The exhibition showcased the various artists from the region.  The war photography still leaves a somber imprint.

We left around 5pm when the museum closed, only to find there were no cabs.  So it took a while to find one but if you have the GoCab app, that might help!

Be Easy Brewpub
We cabbed it back to Aomori and stopped by this brewery.  Their Hazy IPA was good! Thanks Ben for the hospitality! Looking forward to your Cajun spin on things!

Dinner - some Izakaya
Had way too much to drink and don’t remember much….

Day 3: Off to Sendai 

But breakfast at Aomori Gyosai Center first.

We took the 9:35 train to Shin Aomori, to head to Sendai.  Honestly, a bit hungover on the Shinkansen right now.  Ciao!

1kz35df,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kz35df,"23M – Recently quit smoking, started gym – Can someone review my health check results and suggest improvements","Hi everyone,
I’m a 23-year-old male working as a software engineer. I recently quit smoking (used to smoke 1–2 cigarettes daily for 6 months), and I’ve started going to the gym 3 weeks ago. I just got a basic health checkup done and would appreciate some input on my results and what I should focus on improving.

Here are my stats and results:

Age: 23

Height: 175 cm

Weight: 80 kg

BP: 141/66 mmHg

Heart Rate: 80 bpm and with ECG it shown 67

GRBS : 124 mg/dL

ECG: [Attached image – doctor said it's okay but I’d like a second opinion]

Lifestyle: No alcohol, no tea/coffee, quit smoking 2–3 weeks ago

Gym: Recently started 


Questions:

1. Is the BP of 141/66 concerning? Could this be due to gym/exercise?


2. Is GRBS of 124 mg/dL okay for a non-diabetic?


3. How’s my overall health based on this?

As I was telling about a food i got from a street food stall, I point out that I remember they don’t store their food right and I still ate it (lol im stupid ik) she starts to lecture me about how *I* store food in the house and accuse me of food spoilage in our house. 

I then tell her how i’ve been having this pain for days now then she somehow blames my coffee intake??? Telling me its triggering the stomach ache. 

I tell recall with her about my symptoms, how long ive been in pain, the variables, where ive been eating. She then goes : “You don’t listen to me anyway, I’m just a no-salary mother that doesn’t has a voice in this house” 

…did I cause this? Am i the problem? Am i really a shit daughter?!

1kz33ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kz33ti/psa_anyone_struggling_with_early_waking_insomnia/,PSA: Anyone struggling with early waking insomnia,"Have you quit coffee only to find yourself waking up after 4-6 hours each night, unable to get back to sleep? Tried everything? 

I learned this technique from the Sleep Coach School YouTube channel. Lots of great resources but it can be info overload sometimes, so I've summarised one of the core techniques they teach that helped me fix my early waking insomnia. It should work for other types of insomnia too.

First, some facts:

While you may get to sleep easily, your sleep drive is simply not strong enough to see you through the night. You therefore wake up too early, and even after every sleep cycle. That's all this problem is and nothing more. 

Your sleep isn't broken, your sleep cycle has just been displaced due to removal of stimulants and needs readjustment. 


What to do:

1) Set a morning alarm. I prefer to set it for the latest time I have to get up for work (8am) so I have no choice but to get out of bed. 

2) Set an evening alarm. After this alarm, you try and stop looking at the clock (or at least stop caring about the time) - 11pm works for me. 

3) Each night, only go to sleep when you cannot keep your eyes open any longer. Any activity up until this point is allowed (yes, even screens) as long as your intent isn't to MAKE sleep happen. Instead, just LET it happen. 
 

What to expect:

A) You will go to sleep 'late' according to society's standards (whether it's 1am or 4am, it's okay).

B) You will be tired at first. 

C) Regardless, your fear and anxiety will start to decrease as you take back control. Ups and downs are normal. 

D) Your natural sleep drive will build up due to the late bedtimes and reduced anxiety. 

E) Your sleep will start to normalise - it may take a few months to fully recover but you should experience incremental improvements over that time, with inevitable speed bumps. 

This worked for me, I hope it works for you!

We have a six month old son. Lauren is stay-at-home. 

About 3-ish months into us dating, I was in a very bad car accident. It is a miracle that I am alive. I was in the ICU for 3 weeks and things were very touch and go if I was going to make it. But, after a couple of weeks, I started improving, eventually got released from the hospital, went through about 9 months of intense physical therapy, and am in better shape and health today than I was the day before the accident. 

We have a pretty relaxed and good life. Lauren has a an ex-boyfriend, ""Henry"" who she dated throughout high school and college. I have a good childhood friend (""Luke"") who recently moved back to town. Last weekend, his folks threw a party to welcome him back. Luke's little sister, ""Meghan,"" brought the guy she had been seeing for awhile. It was Henry. Lauren and Henry exchanged an awkward greeting and hug, but I thought nothing of it. We certainly were not expecting to see him there. 

Well, Meghan found it suspicious, interrogated Henry, where he admitted that while I was in the ICU early on, Lauren and him met up for coffee, went back to his place, got hot and heavy and were about to have sex, then he stopped them, Lauren got mad at him about it, and she left. That was the last time they had seen each other.

Meghan called me on Monday and relayed this information. On Tuesday, after I put my son to sleep, asked Lauren, ""Is there something that you need to tell me about you and Henry?"" She said, ""No."" I then asked, ""You did not meet up with him at [name of local coffee shop Meghan gave me] and go back to his place when I was in the hospital?"" She began to cry and simultaneously kept repeating ""I'm sorry"" over and over again. I asked her to sit down and tell me exactly what happened. She then told me and it matched what Meghan said Henry told her.

We had a long discussion. She offered what she called an ""explanation, not an excuse"" about how we were so early, she did not take the relationship seriously at the time and she did not know if I would make it. Henry was something comfortable and familiar when everything else seemed so chaotic. She denies ever cheating since. She asked me to not breakup and she would do whatever I need for her to regain trust. I said, ""I need a paternity test."" She absolutely agreed. So, we are going to get that done. She is sleeping in the guest room for now.

My plan right now is to get the paternity test. If it comes back negative, it is an absolute breakup. If it comes back positive, it will greatly affect my son if we breakup, even if that is what I want.

I've been at my company in LA working in tech for some time. We usually don't get many new employees but one of our younger staff members who I liked a lot quit and they hired a new help desk employee who for the sake of this post I will call Kelly. She was settling in the first couple days and I only saw her walk by but she seemed very upbeat and excited to start working and very invested in the business. She is a 5'10""ish blonde woman in her 20s. 

I had my first interaction with her yesterday as we transited opposite sides of the hallway. I said good morning, she glanced at me for a moment, with a sulky look on her face and kept walking. Little did she know, her department needs to produce a report daily that they hand into me, they also brief me on the report as the help desk is one of the 7 departments that I manage. 

Well, when she was informed of who I was and that her department does answer to me, apparently she burst out laughing in the break room, and said that she's shocked I have any sort of authority. She was also said that I am incapable of managing such duties, and went as far as saying she is already more qualified.... Then the best part. You guessed. ""He's so short whose going to listen to him?"" One of my colleagues at work who was in the break room heard the convo as he was getting coffee and later told me. Normally he isn't one to spread drama or anything , but we are both Indian and are from the same region, so we have always been close. 

She also brought up a tik Tok meme apparently ripping on short guys, I don't know which one but those types of videos are posted in her regularly so.

Just made me feel like shit. I get enough outside of work but at least working in this business, IT types are very much about their own niche hobbies and couldn't care less about societal standards.. than this one Gen Z walks in and starts spreading stupid shit like this. Even the people in the break room I guess were taken aback by it. It just doesn't happen in our company. My company has always been a sanctuary for me but with her here I think it's just going to make me quit. I've been figuring to move for awhile anyway.

Well if we ALWAYS get the mini donuts then they’re not a treat anymore. Then they start to become a habit and part of our diet. On those grounds, having mini donuts every day does not balance. The NORM needs to be no donuts. But it could easily slip into every day donuts. I do not get tired of donuts. 

So today I said NO MINI DONUTS even though i definitely COULD HAVE GONE FOR SOME MINI DONUTS, and in the end I victoriously didn’t have any mini donuts. 

So when we are a grown up, NOT getting the mini donuts is a win if we are working on balance. 

If I had gotten the donuts, I wouldn’t have this win to report!  I like to think neuroscience would be proud of me, so on their behalf I’m giving myself 8 stars!!!!  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

# A No-Filter Reality Check & Complete 7-Phase Transformation Blueprint 

You’re the **owner & driver** of your life’s high-performance machine—your **mind-body-spirit**. Right now, Big Tobacco and a profit-driven system have you trapped in **slave mode**, slowly corroding your engine. This guide is your **weapon** to:

1. **Crush** the old “smoker slave” programming
2. **Upgrade** every mental, emotional, physical, energetic & spiritual component
3. **Launch** yourself as a **master driver** in a Ferrari-level supercar of human potential

Once you complete these 7 phases, the “addicted you” is **deleted**, and the authoritative, unstoppable “Master You” emerges.

# 🔥 WHY YOU’RE STILL A SLAVE (AND WHO’S PROFITING)

* Big Tobacco and **government** tax revenue rely on your habit. They push “smoke breaks,” medical fees, sickness, and second-hand liability, keeping you **sick, broke, and dependent**.
* **They profit** while you cough, waste money, lose time, and shorten your lifespan.
* You’ve been **programmed** by ads, peer pressure, stress myths, and nicotine’s chemical leash.

**Hard Truth**: If you don’t break this programming, you remain a **puppet**, fueling an industry that doesn’t care when you die, as long as you keep buying.

# 🛠 SYSTEM OVERVIEW: 7 PHASES TO TOTAL FREEDOM

1. **MENTAL REPROGRAMMING** – Delete the “smoker.exe” slave code; install “MasterDriver” OS.
2. **EMOTIONAL SHOCK & POWER SHIFT** – Make addiction feel like a prison; quitting feel like peak thrill.
3. **PHYSICAL DETOX & PERFORMANCE UPGRADE** – Flush nicotine sludge; rebuild your body as a supercar.

High risk high reward. And I feel like taking that gamble again.  
But, in the interests of improving my odds, I would like a little bit of help...so I'm soliciting your reviews!

For context, I like masculine scents (but I'm open to anything!), and based on the Alkemia scents that have agreed with me, I'm interested in trying the following scent profiles/notes from them: coffee, leather, unique incenses, Alkemia's most niche/weird scents, dark gourmands & ambers. Also possibly tea, rain and some aquatics though I don't have the highest hopes for these latter.  
I'm wanting to avoid: unlisted white amber notes!!!, smoke and dirt notes, light/fresh florals, and the Alkemia soapy curse, which seem to be the factors responsible for most of my unsuccessful samplings from them.

1kz2nxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BumpersWhoBolus/comments/1kz2nxy/is_my_high_risk_diabetes_in_pregnancy_doctor_a/,Is my high risk diabetes in pregnancy doctor a complete quack?,"This is gonna be a bit long so please stick around, I desperately need other opinions. I (25F) have had type 1 diabetes since I was barely 9 years old and have been managing by myself since I was about 14 after my mom passed away. I have never had good experiences with endocrinologists, but I am now 25 weeks pregnant with my first baby and am seeing a “high risk” doctors office.

Now, despite my past of not being a perfect diabetic, I consider myself pretty damn knowledgeable about the disease as it’s been at the front of my mind for the past 16 years. Since being pregnant, my glucose levels look better than they ever have in my life due to myself being extremely vigilant, counting every carbohydrate, checking glucose 10+ times a day etc. My levels are in range 75% of the time.

I had an appointment with this doctor yesterday, we’ll call him Dr S, and despite my glucose levels being good for the most part, he changed ALL OF MY MEDICATIONS. And not just a little, but a lot.

I drink coffee every morning (with OB approval.) as I’m sure some of you know, coffee spikes sugar very fast. I have been pre-bolusing 20 mins in advance for my coffee and am still seeing spikes. This is the ONLY thing consistently wrong with my levels that needed fixed, which could have been solved by bolusing sooner and perhaps a slightly higher dose. Nothing else in my day to day needed changing, and my blood sugar log showed him that very clearly. Regardless of this, he decided to up my Lantus by 5 units (I take it in the morning.) from 31 units to 36 for no reason?? He also changed my insulin to carb ratio from 1:8 to 1:6 for the whole day. I also take an NPH insulin at night to help with my fasting glucose levels in the morning. The highest number I had for fasting was 184 and that was one day out of a week. Because of this one outlier, he changed my dosage from 8 units to 14 of the NPH. The first night of me taking this I was sent low twice in an 8 hour period.

Another issue - in a weeks worth of logged glucose levels, I have ONE low sugar of 64. Dr S points to this number and tells me he wants me to stop pre-bolusing for my food and start taking my insulin during my last bite so I have a more precise calculation of carbs…..huh????? This goes against everything I’ve ever been taught in my life, and to change something like this because of one low level, just doesn’t sound like a good idea.

I came to Reddit because I’m concerned. I don’t want to follow a single one of these medication changes. It all seems too drastic and somewhat unnecessary. I also try to keep the opinion that I am not a doctor. But my gut is screaming at me not to jump straight into these new dosages. I am scared of dangerous lows, which can also become very expensive and problematic when I don’t have a pantry fully stocked with juices and puddings and snacks while at work 8 hours of the day.

I want to do what’s right for my baby, and that usually means following doctor’s orders. But what do you do when doctor’s orders scare and concern you as much as these concern me?

Any thoughts from medical professionals and T1D warriors alike are welcome! Thanks!",2,1748607202.0,BumpersWhoBolus,8,1.0,False
