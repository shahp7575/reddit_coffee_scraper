[Breville Bambino],"Recently decided to get into espresso-making after years of owning a Nespresso. I'm using a Breville Bambino with a Kingrinder K6 (20 clicks). My coffee beans were recently delivered by Atlas Coffee Club (dark roast).

Here is my workflow:

1. Weigh/grind 18 grams of coffee beans
2. WDT tool to break up clumps
3. Bang the portafilter on the counter to even out the coffee
4. Use a coffee distributer/leveler to even everything out
5. Tamp

I see massive improvement compared to when I first started, but here are a few observations:

1. I see multiple streams at first, is it okay that  it starts this way before they converge into one?
2. Trying to adjust the volume for my shots is finicky. I manually set the volume to target about 36g, but   I get a lot more volume. In this particular video I got about 55g in 42seconds. Is it possible that I set this volume when I was grinding too fine, so there is more volume now?

Should the programmed volume be re-adjusted once everything has been dialed in?

Looking forward to feedback/criticism!

[EN]

Former owners of a coffee plantation, the Bielle family was at the head of a prosperous coffee company which employed 32 farmers in 1967. Jean Pierre Bielle, health officer at the time, with Valentine Lacave, his wife, and their 4 children . One of the sons, Nicolas Bielle, created a sugar factory with his brother Maximilien after the death of their father. Following the death of Nicolas Bielle, the family was forced to transfer the property to Messrs Espanet et Cie in 1857. The company was dissolved in 1868 and the Espanet heirs inherited a 52 hectare property made up of a main house, a windmill, a sugar factory, 17 farmers' huts and a 14 hectare sugar cane plantation. Fernand Espanet will get into debt until he can no longer get out of it and will in turn transfer the property to Ernest Bourjac in 1882, to neutralize his debts.



The¬†Bielle distillery was founded towards the end of the 19th century and it was only in 1910 that the Bielle distillery began to produce rum in the heart of a territory where sugar cane cultivation predominated. The perpetual evolution of the estate through changes of owners led to the founding of the Bielle distillery and allowed the distillery to acquire a solid reputation in the market for quality agricultural rum. Working with high-quality sugar cane with the true tradition of producing agricultural rum allows the Bielle rum brand to preserve the quality of its products. It was therefore in Marie Galante, also called the island of 100 mills or the island of Canne, that the Bielle distillery was created in the 1910s and the tradition of manufacturing agricultural rum from this era continues to this day.


In 2016, the Bielle distillery innovated in a new process which consit in¬†aging rum on a moving sailboat¬†in a saline environment, tossed by the swell without rest for a vintage of undeniable singularity. The first barrels of rum therefore crossed the sea on the¬†Tres Hombres¬†in order to make dynamik rum. This adventure was born from the authenticity of the Tres Hombres idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreactivating the maritime transport of goods by sail for ecological transport. This is how this brick-schooner crosses the oceans with quality products on board such as coffee from Colombia, cocoa from the Dominican Republic or Rum Bielle from Marie-Galante.


„ÄäOn June 19, 2020, the Schooner Bielle Marie-Galante left its home port with 1,590 liters of rum in its belly (62 barrels) to reach Marseille with the plan to follow in the wake of Ulysses and wear the colors of his rum and Marie-Galante. The crew had set off joyfully for this distant race, but on this moonless night, harsh and sad, the beautiful bird was shattered in mid-flight. Fortunately, the crew members were able to safely get on the reef while the sea regurgitated the barrels and scattered the wreckage of the ship into the waves. The fate of our beautiful schooner joining this magnificent odyssey came to an abrupt end. I had traced my will along the path of stars to join this magnificent odyssey but the sea in its sorrowful jealousy took revenge on the love I had for this project.„Äã

Ancienne propri√©taire de plantation de caf√©, la famille Bielle √©tait √† la t√™te d‚Äôune prosp√®re cafeti√®re qui faisait travailler 32 cultivateurs en 1967. Jean Pierre Bielle, officier de sant√© √† l‚Äô√©poque, avec Valentine Lacave, son √©pouse, et leurs 4 enfants. Un des fils, Nicolas Bielle, cr√©e une sucrerie avec son fr√®re Maximilien apr√®s le d√©c√®s de leur p√®re. Suite au d√©c√®s de Nicolas Bielle, le famille est contrainte de c√©der √† Messieurs Espanet et Cie la propri√©t√© en 1857. La soci√©t√© sera dissoute en 1868 et les h√©ritiers Espanet h√©ritent d‚Äôune propri√©t√© de 52 hectares compos√©e d‚Äôune maison principale, d‚Äôun moulin √† vent, d‚Äôune sucrerie, de 17 cases de cultivateurs et d‚Äôune plantation de canne √† sucre de 14 hectares. Fernand Espanet va s‚Äôendetter jusqu‚Äô√† ne plus s‚Äôen sortir et va c√©der √† son tour la propri√©t√© √† Ernest Bourjac en 1882, pour neutraliser ses dettes.


La¬†distillerie Bielle¬†a √©t√© fond√©e vers la fin du XIX√® si√®cle et c‚Äôest seulement en 1910 que la distillerie Bielle va commencer √† produire du rhum au c≈ìur d‚Äôun territoire o√π pr√©domine la culture de la canne √† sucre. L‚Äô√©volution perp√©tuelle du domaine au fil des changements de propri√©taires a men√© √† la fondation de la distillerie Bielle et a permis √† la distillerie d'acqu√©rir une r√©putation solide dans le march√© des rhum agricole de qualit√©. Le travail de la canne √† sucre de haute qualit√© avec la v√©ritable tradition d'√©laboration de rhum agricole permet √† la marque¬†rhum Bielle¬†de pr√©server la qualit√© de ses produits. C‚Äôest donc √† Marie Galante, appel√© √©galement l‚Äô√Æle des 100 moulins ou encore l‚Äô√Æle de la Canne que la distillerie Bielle a vu le jour dans les ann√©es 1910 et la tradition de fabrication du rhum agricole de cette √©poque perdure jusqu‚Äô√† ce jour.

En 2016, la distillerie Bielle innove dans un nouveau proc√©d√© qui est celui du¬†vieillissement du rhum sur un voilier en mouvement¬†dans un environnement salin, ballot√© par la houle sans repos pour une cuv√©e √† la singularit√© ind√©niable. Les premiers f√ªts de rhum ont donc fait leur travers√©e sur le¬†Tres Hombres¬†afin de faire du rhum dynamik

Cette aventure est n√©e de l‚Äôauthenticit√© de l‚Äôid√©e du Tr√®s Hombres de r√©activer le transport maritime de marchandises √† la voile pour un transport √©cologique. C‚Äôest ainsi que ce brick-go√©lette traverse les oc√©ans avec √† son bord des produits de qualit√© tels le caf√© de Colombie, le cacao de la R√©publique Dominicaine ou le Rhum Bielle de Marie-Galante.

Le 19 juin 2020, la Go√©lette Bielle Marie-Galante quittait son port d‚Äôattache avec 1590 litres de rhum dans le ventre (62 tonnelets) pour rejoindre Marseille avec le projet d‚Äôaller dans le sillage d‚ÄôUlysse porter les couleurs de son rhum et de Marie-Galante.
L‚Äô√©quipage √©tait parti joyeux pour cette course lointaine, mais par cette nuit sans lune, dure et triste fortune, le bel oiseau s‚Äôest fracass√© en plein vol.
Fort heureusement, l‚Äô√©cueil hospitalier a r√©cup√©r√© l‚Äô√©quipage sain et sauf pendant que la mer r√©gurgitait les tonnelets et dispersait dans les flots les d√©bris du navire. Le destin de notre belle go√©lette rejoignant cette magnifique odyss√©e s‚Äôest arr√™t√© tout net.
J‚Äôavais trac√© ma volont√© en chemin d‚Äô√©toiles pour rejoindre cette magnifique odyss√©e mais la mer dans sa jalousie chagrine s‚Äôest veng√©e de l‚Äôamour que j‚Äôavais pour ce projet.„Äã

1holwgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1holwgf/did_anybody_else_kinda_semiforget_that_mormons/,Did anybody else kinda semi-forget that Mormons are Christians while growing up?,"To add a little context to this, I am a 40 year old man who was born and raised as a TBM in southern Utah.  This is what I remember of my church education as a kid:  

Lots of trivial nonsense about Joseph Smith.  Did you know Joseph Smith was a stick pull champion?  Joseph Smith was 6 ft tall, 200 pounds and very athletic and strong!  One time as a child, Joseph Smith had to have his leg operated on and he was offered some whiskey as an anesthetic which he refused because gosh darnit, Joseph was just so humble and pure even though the word of wisdom, nor any other part of the restored gospel had been revealed at this time.  

  
Aside from Joseph we also were taught plenty about our pioneer ancestors.  Numerous random faith-promoting stories about the pioneers crossing the plains and their trying early days once they had arrived in Zion.  Oh, and you better believe we heard a lot about how the saints were So PeRsEcUtEd during their early days in the Midwest and were constantly being ran out of town because they had the truth and Satan had control over their enemies.

  
There was also ample discussion about rules.  Rules, rules, rules.  Oh...and did I mention rules?  No sleeveless shirts, no short shorts, no showing legs, midriffs or shoulders.  Don't date until 16 and even then you should only go on group dates.  No rated R movies and sometimes even PG-13 movies were discouraged.  No cussing or inappropriate jokes.  No porn.  Don't hang out with the bad kids.  Absolutely 100 percent do not do anything even remotely fun or enjoyable on Sunday.  Girl's swimsuits should always be one piece.  Stay away from parties where Gospel standards are not being met.  Avoid even the very appearance of evil! Only one set of ear piercings for girls, no piercings at all for boys, no tattoos, only conservative clothing and hairstyles.  No coffee, tobacco, tea, alcohol, or drugs.  Caffeinated sodas were still kind of a grey area.  No necking or petting (terms that were so outdated I had no idea what the fuck they were), no masturbation or porn.  Sexual sins are next to murder in seriousness.  ALL sexual sins must be confessed to the Bishop.  If boys don't want to go on a mission, tough shit you are going on a mission.  Girls, you are excused.  Just hurry up and get married and start making babies.  Read your scriptures daily.  Never get into any of that ""anti-mormon"" material.  It will allow Satan to take hold of you and deceive you.  Seek out information from approved sources only.  Never disobey or question church doctrines or your church leaders.

  
There were a ton of quotes from the prophets and apostles.  Mostly the ones from the 1950s up to the current crop.  Ol' Gordon B. Stinky was the head honcho through most of my youth so he got a lot of air time.  Seems like we heard mostly from the one's from the 1950s up to the current crop of prophets and apostles at that time, and even some up to our current time.  Some of the old gasbags that really stand out in my memory as being quoted a lot are Boyd K. Packer \*wretching sounds\*, Spencer W. Kimball, David O. McKay, Bruce R. McConkie, Tommy Monson, Eyring, Ballard, L. Tom Petty, and Extra Daft Benson.

All in all the focus was very much on a white washed version of the early history of the saints, a laundry list of Mormon specific rules,  the philosophies of (the aforementioned) men, mingled with scripture.  A lot of focus on just an unwritten Mormon culture that would pervade your upbringing if you grew up Mormon around that time.  When I entered the MTC prior to serving my mission in Iowa in 2004 I had a bit of a mindfuck.  We were going over the lessons that we would teach the investigators and it was all, ""Jesus Christ this, Savior that, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.""  I remember having this thought pass through my mind that was more or less like, ""oh yeah, we are a Christian church that claims to follow the restored church of Jesus.""   Don't get me wrong, I know that a restoration of Christ's church, and a purported directive to follow Christ have always been taught in the Mormon church.  It didn't seem like a huge central focus to me though.  At least not to the youth.  I felt like we were taught to follow men, more than Jesus.  It just seemed so much to me like our focus was on pioneers, Mormon culture, Mormon prophets, Mormon rules.  Mormon shit, not Jesus shit.

I had none, my ex wife had a good chunk. We did our own separation agreement, later filed by her. I tried to be the good guy, and in the agreement, it was stated that her RRSP's was hers and I would not file a claim and I didn't want any of it.. However, if she ever came after me for additional money for any reason, I would go after her RRSP's. This was 2007. I was to pay $350 a month in child support, based on my income at the time. I was laid off 2 years later and for a very long time, could not find a job to resume my career. We had an agreement to drop the support to $200 until my income recovered, as I was only receiving EI. Fall 2010, my career resumed and I resumed the $350. A few months later, I get a hostile letter from the Family Responsibility Office, with threats of garnishing my pay, seizing my accounts and passport, etc. What the fuck? That's how they tell you a case has been filed. Eventually, they told me she not only wanted the back support payments, but padded additional bogus expenses (all denied). I faxed 65 pages of receipts and the $200 agreement. They said they didn't care, and ordered me to pay about $2000. No big deal. My case worker at the FRO was on my side, as she saw these bullshit claims all the time. She said I could pay it back over 18 months if I wanted to. I agreed. Made my ex furious, as she simply wanted quick cash to go to Cuba. (Overheard by my son and relayed to me).

I let it go again. Now, 14 years later, she has been remarried 6 years, me remarried 2 years. I was thinking of our agreement. She broke it filing that bogus claim. She had also lied to her employer the year before in 2008 and got herself fired from a prestigious and well paying job at a very well known university. I took her to a $500/hr  lawyer who got her a decent settlement for wrongful termination. I didn't get a cup of coffee as thanks.

So, is there a time limit on going after what is my rightful share of her RRSP's? She broke the separation agreement. I have all the paperwork.",2,1735439144.0,legaladvicecanada,1,1.0,False

Tone is what a phrase or statement means or comes across as despite what it's actually saying. examples of tone could be serious, joking, lighthearted, etc. 

  
*What are tone tags/indicators?*   
Tone tags/indicators are things you can include with text to indicate what the tone of it is. 

*Why are they used?*   
Some people have difficulty picking up on tone. communicating through text only makes this harder due to lack of audio and physical clues (voice inflection, body language, facial expressions, etc.) tagging what tone you are using can be very helpful for others understanding of what you're saying, clarification, avoiding miscommunications, etc.

I‚Äôm a (F,29) and my best friend (F,30) have been friends for about 4 years since Covid lockdown. We met through mutual friends. For 4 years we did everything together and spoke every day. Recently a few things have happened in our friendship group causing some people to fall out. 

My best friend has a habit of lying and making stories up, I‚Äôm a typical people pleaser so I go along with most things as I don‚Äôt want to upset people.
She‚Äôs been caught on in a few lies, which has caused upset.

My other friends started to notice when we went away for a holiday that she can be really horrible to me. She makes mean jokes, embarrasses me in front of others, can be quite cruel in general. Some of my other friends said she was a bit of a bully.
Now I didn‚Äôt really pay attention to this un till she started to judge my relationship and what me and my husband like to do together. Constantly saying we need to go out on more dates together etc, when in reality we do have dates just they include take away and board games together or movies nights in (Which I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain to someone).  

Anyway long story short I‚Äôve kinda taken a step back and withdrew from her. She‚Äôs asked me several times if she‚Äôs done anything wrong and me being a people pleaser has said no because I don‚Äôt want to upset her. 

My plan was to see her little and often for coffee catch ups and hope it fizzles out etc.

Truly couldn't ask for a better partner and I try to let her know every day. Today we got pretty upset with each other though. 

She wanted to spend some family time so she took the twins to her parents house for the day. First time in months that I've had any time to myself, and holy shit the stars aligned that it was 4 straight hours. Hallelujah! 

So I split it. I took care of chores and errands for 2 hours and did my own thing for the other 2. She's always telling me to take care of myself and I did! It felt great for once.

Then she comes home. Uh oh. Why wasn't the bathroom fully cleaned? Why didn't I wipe down the counters? Why didn't I get the coffee table just a little bit more organized? These are all just five minute jobs, what did I even do with my afternoon? 

Well... I did the dishes, which she's stopped seeing because I'm so on top of it that the default state of the sink is ""clean"". I did two loads of laundry that went from hamper to washer to dryer to folded in the dresser before she even noticed it needed doing. I did a quick wipe down of the bathroom but not a deep clean. I went to the pharmacy for medicine. I did quite a bit actually.

Feeling a bit defeated at the moment. She's always trying to support me and tell me that I need to carve out time to take care of my self.

As a functioning coffee addict IRL, I stocked up my base with coffee in every cupboard. Because when the Reavers come knocking, I'm going to want a decent mocha while I watch the point defences shred them. But even when I've taken damage by opening doors into decompressed areas with my face, right-click will not the coffee.

I have tried having a single item in the stack, having major health damage, drinking in a pressurised environment. Nothing works. I sat there with my RL coffee this morning for far too many seconds contemplating this, and could not come up with a solution.

Any guidance would be awesome. Am sure I'm missing something obvious, and happy to be the Point-And-Laugh of the Day.

The crisp morning air carried the scent of damp earth and diesel, mingling with the faint aroma of coffee brewing in tin mugs.



Soldiers moved about the camp, each immersed in their routines. On one side of the clearing, a group of men and women jogged in formation, their boots pounding against the gravel in rhythm. Closer to the main gates, a pair of sentries stood stoically, rifles slung over their shoulders, their eyes scanning the landscape for any sign of movement beyond the wire fence.



Inside the barracks, I sat on a wooden crate near the edge of the training grounds, carefully disassembling my rifle. The familiar motions were soothing, but my mind raced. Rumors had been circulating since dawn‚Äîwhispers of a surprise assault on a hidden enemy headquarters nestled deep between the trees of a nearby city. The mission, they said, was imminent.



I wiped the bolt clean with an oily rag, my fingers moving automatically as my thoughts spiraled. If the rumors were true, it wouldn‚Äôt be long before we were called to action. Across the clearing, I could see others preparing in their own ways‚Äîtightening straps, checking ammunition, and exchanging quiet words. The air felt heavy with anticipation.



The sharp, shrill tone of the alarm cut through the camp, silencing the hum of conversation. Within moments, our team was assembled: eleven heavily armed soldiers standing shoulder to shoulder in a tight line near the main staging area.



Our team leader, Captain Anatoly, stood in front of us, barking orders. ‚ÄúThis is it, men. HQ confirmed the intel. Enemy HQ between the trees, just outside the city. We move in, neutralize the threat, and secure the area before reinforcements arrive. Routine mission. Fast and clean. Air support is on standby.‚Äù



Fast and clean, I thought, exchanging a glance with Ivan, my closest friend and squadmate. His lips were pressed into a thin line, his fingers twitching slightly as they gripped his rifle. Like me, he didn‚Äôt buy the captain‚Äôs assurances. We knew better. The enemy wasn‚Äôt stupid. If they‚Äôd set up a headquarters there, it was fortified. Maybe booby traps. Maybe an ambush. Maybe worse.



The others seemed unfazed. The medics checked their packs, the engineers adjusted their demolition charges, and the heavy AT specialists stood like statues, their launchers slung over their shoulders. They trusted the plan, trusted Anatoly. I envied their confidence.



‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just about us,‚Äù Anatoly continued. ‚ÄúThis is about pushing the line. The intel is solid. Stick to the plan, watch each other‚Äôs backs, and we‚Äôll be back here before dinner.‚Äù



Ivan leaned close, muttering under his breath. ‚ÄúLight resistance, he says. Next thing you know, we‚Äôll be walking into a hornet‚Äôs nest.‚Äù



I nodded, slinging my rifle over my shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just clearing a building. We‚Äôre walking into their backyard.‚Äù



As the team filed toward the waiting transport vehicles, the weight of the mission settled in my chest. Routine mission. That‚Äôs what Anatoly called it. Just some shooting, some air support, and we‚Äôd clean up the rest.



But Ivan and I knew better. There was no such thing as routine. Not here. Not today.

He doesn‚Äôt buy me anniversary gifts, bday , Mother‚Äôs Day gifts etc.  I just buy my own.  We have a 3 year old child together. I take care of 99.9 % of the time. She‚Äôs in daycare but on weekends we are always out at a festival or something. He never wants to do anything with her unless I go as well so never really get a break. He likes to be a kill joy so I try not to invite him out with us. He complains, or he will make us late, or wants to start an argument.  He‚Äôs spends hours on the toilet every day. At least 3 hours.  Smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee, then toilet.  Financially he‚Äôs a good provider but that‚Äôs it.  I also work.  This week I took my daughter to a resort for Christmas. We arrived the day of late.  Every day we were there he tried to argue. One day he said he didn‚Äôt care about me or didn‚Äôt like me. I told him what he thinks of me is not my concern.  The next day as I was fixing my daughter hair. I mentioned her favorite color is pink so he said I can‚Äôt force this on het suppose she likes steel gray or white or magenta.  He went on and on. I ignored him.  I finally said if he spent more than 5 minutes with her he would know she‚Äôs seen several colors and chose pink. The next day I told him to take her to the pool. He didn‚Äôt want to get in either her so of course I did. She did so many activities the day before we were to leave that she ended up sleeping at 12am. All the activities with me. So at 728 am while I‚Äôm half sleep and my baby is asleep he asks for the tv remote. I said no it‚Äôs 2 early so he stated tickling or poking me to give him the remote. I said no please leave me alone and she‚Äôs asleep. He kept bothering me so I swung my fist around and said leave me the F alone.  I guess it connected to his head cause he got mad and got up to get the remote and threw my stuff on the floor.  That was the last day at the resort. As we drive home we stopped at the museum for her to visit and play. As we are leaving it‚Äôs her lunch time he said I‚Äôm doing my own thing you two have to get food. I‚Äôm like no problem. So I get our food. I‚Äôm not really speaking to him and he‚Äôs not really speaking unless it‚Äôs necessary.  Yesterday I took my shoes off and left the under the kitchen table.  I got busy doing something with kid or cleaning.  He went to sit in the chair where my shoes were. Something made me look up and he‚Äôs kicking my shoes with this disgusted look on his face. I said why are you kicking my shoes. That‚Äôs weird. He said the shouldn‚Äôt be in the way. I laughed and said you‚Äôre upset cause you were bothering me when I asked you to leave me alone. I just shook my head and said evil.  I‚Äôm sleeping in the guest room with my daughter. He always sets out to ruin the mood. Thanksgiving I took my nephew to dinner I told him he didn‚Äôt have to go.  He went anyway to complain about prices and sit there and not order food.  I said why are you here complaining you could have stayed home.  Sometimes he likes to annoy our baby.  I bought her a bluey pillow. She told him not to touch it. Everyday he does it to annoy her.  Some times she will say stop dad don‚Äôt touch me then he will say fine don‚Äôt talk to me. To a kid!!! I‚Äôm over this marriage and I just don‚Äôt like him. ",7,1735438250.0,Marriage,18,0.77,False

During my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly‚Äînow stuck w/ a 67‚Äù gut, looking overdue with quadruplets. Doctors say it‚Äôs the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. ","Over the past 9+ months, I‚Äôve experienced a truly surreal transformation due to an extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy.‚Äù I (M31) have gained 130 pounds‚Äîall in my belly‚Äîduring my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, leaving me with a 67-inch waistline and a silhouette that looks more overdue with quadruplets than any standard body type. While I‚Äôve come to terms with the medical side of this condition, one of the most frustrating aspects of my transformation has been figuring out how to dress myself with any sense of style, comfort, or dignity.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

My body has outgrown nearly every piece of clothing I own, and I‚Äôm at a loss for what to wear. Button-up shirts pull so tight that they gape open, and even the largest sizes I‚Äôve tried seem to ride up over my belly whenever I move. Pants are just as difficult‚Äîthey constantly dig into the underside of my belly or refuse to stay up without a belt, which only emphasizes how far my stomach pushes out. Most of the time, I feel like I‚Äôm one wardrobe malfunction away from total embarrassment, and it‚Äôs only added to the already overwhelming stares and comments I get in public.

I‚Äôm hoping this community can offer some guidance on how to dress for my unique proportions. Are there certain brands or cuts that might better accommodate a large, round belly? Should I prioritize oversized fits, stretchy materials, or specific types of tailoring? I‚Äôd also love tips on colors or layering techniques to downplay the size of my belly and create a more balanced look. Any advice on how to make my wardrobe functional, flattering, and comfortable would be incredibly appreciated.

For context, I‚Äôll include the details of my transformation and condition below. Feel free to AMA if you‚Äôre curious‚Äîthanks so much for your help:

I never thought I‚Äôd be writing this, but after what‚Äôs happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I‚Äôm living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children‚Äîtwins!‚Äîand her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what‚Äôs called Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy,‚Äù where men mimic some of their partner‚Äôs pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny‚Äîme complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

Within 9+ months, I‚Äôve gained over 130 pounds, and it‚Äôs all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition‚ÄîCushing‚Äôs syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife‚Äôs pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here‚Äôs the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It‚Äôs perfectly round, heavy, and tight‚Äîso much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I‚Äôve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public‚Äôs stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, ‚ÄúWhen are you due?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you having twins‚Äîor is it triplets?‚Äù Sometimes, people assume I‚Äôm joking when I say I‚Äôm not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling ‚ÄúHey, heifer! How‚Äôd you get so huge, fatass!‚Äù and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, ‚ÄúWhen are the babies due?‚Äù and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, ‚ÄúAre you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you‚Äôre about to pop!‚Äù His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn‚Äôt pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like ‚ÄúDamn, bro, that‚Äôs the most impressive belly I‚Äôve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called ‚Äúthe most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.‚Äù The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife‚Äôs parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn‚Äôt believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it‚Äôs become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife‚Äôs.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife‚Äôs pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She‚Äôs been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I‚Äôm taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can‚Äôt help feeling guilty‚Äîthis was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I‚Äôm the one everyone‚Äôs talking about.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don‚Äôt fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I‚Äôve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don‚Äôt last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren‚Äôt any better‚Äîthey‚Äôre so tight under the curve of my gut that I‚Äôve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I‚Äôm required to wear a uniform‚Äîa button-up shirt, no less‚Äîand squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pop, and they often do‚Äîsometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I‚Äôve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I‚Äôm outgrowing something else, to the point where I‚Äôm running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it‚Äôs going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I‚Äôve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôm wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I‚Äôve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They‚Äôve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they‚Äôve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like a sideshow. I‚Äôve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I‚Äôve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there‚Äôs a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I‚Äôd wake up nauseous when she did, I‚Äôd have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I‚Äôd have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn‚Äôt just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body‚Äôs hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I‚Äôve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn‚Äôt helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I‚Äôm not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I‚Äôve been experiencing‚Äîlike elevated prolactin and cortisol levels‚Äîhave completely derailed any sense of self-control. It‚Äôs as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I‚Äôve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn‚Äôt anymore‚Ä¶ Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of ‚Äúhyper-storage mode,‚Äù where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it‚Äôs mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it‚Äôs created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It‚Äôs crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult‚Äîand frankly embarrassing‚Äîsymptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it‚Äôs such a large part of the psychological side effects I‚Äôve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I‚Äôm meant to desire or enjoy. It‚Äôs almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They‚Äôve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop‚Äîmy body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I‚Äôve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices‚Äîlike overeating or not avoiding tight clothes‚Äîthat exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It‚Äôs created a cycle where I feel like I‚Äôm feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body‚Äôs way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don‚Äôt want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I‚Äôve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It‚Äôs such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it‚Äôs my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it‚Äôs hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I‚Äôm doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I‚Äôve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth‚Äîor if this is something I‚Äôll be living with for the rest of my life.",0,1735438240.0,AskMenAdvice,7,0.33,False

I used to be able to sleep for 10 hours and on rare occasions more. I only ever feel fully rested with 10 hours, and have the ability to function at 8 hours. Anything less, I am a zombie and cannot focus on anything. I also used to be a very deep sleeper. Over the years those things have changed. I am now the lightest sleeper I know, I had a years long phase where I would not be able to fall asleep for a long time no matter how tired I was and when I did, I would have interrupted sleep. Now, it has changed to taking a long time to sleep but being able to sleep throughout the night, however only for around 6 hours and when I do wake up, I am unable to go back to sleep no matter how tired I am, so I have to start my day like the zombie I was talking about.

In the past, I have tried melatonin, it does not work well for me. I still have a hard time sleeping, I get interrupted sleeping and when I do wake up, I am extra groggy and my brain is foggy. I am a zombie on steroids. I also get VERY sadistic dreams.

Over the last 2 years, I have experienced a decline in my cognitive abilities, loss of concentration, and poor memory. I used to have AMAZING memory.

2 years ago, I did a blood test and I was low on some vitamins so for about a year or so I continued to take the supplements. I recently did another blood test and thankfully I am ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in all areas. I no longer have vitamin deficiencies

Now to try and cure this issue.

I have a caffeine addiction, I drink a latte daily that contains 3 espresso shots and syrup. I know that does not seem like a lot for most people but I am a light weight and short, so unlike most people, small doses affect me greatly. nonetheless I do believe, that much sugar and caffeine on a daily basis for over 10 years now is excessive for the average person and can start having negative health reactions on the body.

I plan on doing 3 things, I have already started 2.

I have been writing down the weekly meals I want to have (healthy only) and buying all those healthy groceries and cooking them myself. I have not been eating out.

I have started working out recently.

Now the most difficult one, I plan on quitting caffeine from coffee. I have recently started drinking tea sweetening it with honey, however in combination with my lattes. I will now completely cut out any coffee based caffeine, and alternate between true tea and herbal tea, as I still do not want to be dependent on any form of caffeine in my life. This will prevent both the caffeine and sugar crash from the syrups.

I plan on trying this for a full 6 months before going to see a Dr. about my issues. I am committed to 6 months as I have a habit of quitting things if I do not see almost immediate results. I also think it will take time for my body to get used to this ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù before I see the results. I am holding myself accountable in being patient.

Hopefully this will not only save my wallet but also my health.

I just wanted to share this, so that way in 6 months I can come back and give an update and if it does work it can give someone else hope too, or a very basic cure that most of us don‚Äôt consider trying, which is to make a choice to live a healthy lifestyle.

Please pray for me, I want myself back.",2,1735437858.0,insomnia,2,1.0,False

(Possibly relevant - she isn't afraid of flying, she's done so many times before. She just always has been one to penny pinch & over think things. She also doesn't like going on trips alone.)

On the first week of November, I had asked my mom if she planned to travel and see our extended relatives (who live 10 hours away from us) over the holidays. She said she wasn't sure at that time. Then, it wasn't until a few days before Thanksgiving that she said ""take off work, we are going to your uncle's wedding on New Year's Day."" I told her I would see what I could do. That was already a challenge since all my colleagues at work more than likely requested their time off. Plus, I am also fairly new to the company where I work, so I had the expectation that I probably won't get all the days off I requested. I ended up being approved for only the day before New Year's (and New Year's itself, of course).

I initially thought I could make it work because I do work remotely. Then, I thought it through and told her multiple times that it wouldn't make sense for me to go given my work situation. I reminded her again on Christmas day because she still spoke like we were both going. These are the other reasons why I'm deciding not to go:

* I'm not super close with this uncle, nor has she ever been fond of him. She basically said that we were going to his wedding so we don't ""look bad.""
* I've brought up paying for a flight multiple times. She scoffed at that idea. She remains insistent on driving instead because she is worried about delays, airport business, etc.
* During every long trip that we took, she says she will help me drive but that rarely seems to happen. She drives MUCH slower than the speed limits when she does drive.
* We would be driving overnight because she gets off work at 3-4 PM on New Year's Eve, which I didn't know until 2 weeks ago. Accounting for time to fill up gas, restroom breaks, etc, we would realistically make it there around 3 AM at the EARLIEST. The wedding is at 2 PM on New Year's Day.
* The wedding itself is an all day affair with a tea ceremony, Catholic mass, and reception.
* There isn't an ideal place for me to work remotely. All of my relatives have something going on and  I'm sure there will be a lot of distractions.

Working at a coffee shop or library could get me fired if my IP tracks to a public location).
* My mom sprung it on me on Christmas day that we will have to attend a distant aunt's funeral next week that is 8 hours away from home.
* She insists that I take sick days for the remainder of next week. I've already taken a few sick days in October for actually being sick. That's not a card I want to play if I don't need to, especially if I already wasn't approved for those days off initially.

Today, I told her that I'm definitely not going. She unsurprisingly wasn't thrilled. My brother (who is also unable to get off work) and I kept urging her that it'll be much safer and reasonable to fly & even offered to purchase a ticket for her. She still refuses and is guilt tripping me for making her drive 10 hours overnight. AITAH?",3,1735437855.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

i don't know what to do with my life. isolated, been in my room for months - left the house once in ~6? months, last time talked with a (?friend? ex friend? someone who is not my mother?) 4 months ago, it sucked. the dryest conversation possible (because of me)... 

i don't talk at all. sometimes i whisper lines from musical songs to myself. don't talk with anyone on the internet. feel completely invisible and unneeded. well, the world doesn't need me, that's a fact. it's not even sad.

all i do is scroll reddit and yt... i don't enjoy it, but don't know what else to do. most of the time i don't enjoy anything. i don't see a future for myself. don't want to go to uni (didn't do shit for winter exams lol), don't want to work, i am not happy that i have to live. not this life in particular, just don't like that the life exists, that my consciousness exists.

the only thing that i truly like is eating food and drinking energy drinks/coffee. sometimes drawing. my most favourite thing is daydreaming. that's it. pathetic huh.

I apply the same logic to my spending as best as I can. I had a longer post written out before it got accidentally deleted, but the process is really simple.

* Only Buy when you are replacing an item with a **better** one or it's broken.
* Sell or Donate the old item that was ""Best-in-Slot""

My focus is primarily on the mindfulness aspect of spending rather than the restriction, when I tried restricting myself, I kept making strange justifications and binge buying because it would be ""just this once.""

Example: I purchased a camera to get into a photography hobby with friends. As I was learning my hobby, I discovered that my camera did not have features I needed to do the type of photography I wanted. **I sold my old camera to buy a new one.**

*I am not going to buy another camera until there is a justification to have a second one, or I am replacing the one I have.*

**""What would be a Justification?""**

Typically when having multiple of something improves the quality of life. I have an Aeropress, to save on going out for coffee, I bought another one to keep at my office instead of moving it around back and forth. Also saving me on Coffee when I'm at the office.

**""How do I know what's Best in Slot?""**

That's the neat part, you don't. Technology changes, better products are made, the only thing you need to remember is to be mindful about why you are buying things. Mindless spending is what got me addicted to buying new things even if I didn't need it.

*Remember, you're in control.*

1holeqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhantomBadge/comments/1holeqd/the_reflection_chapter_3_the_history_of_the_mirror/,The Reflection - Chapter 3: The History of the Mirror,"For a long moment, I stood frozen in the bathroom doorway, staring at the smiling reflection.

It wasn‚Äôt a kind smile. It was thin and crooked, like the smirk of someone who knew a secret you didn‚Äôt. My chest tightened as I searched the reflection for some semblance of myself, some sign that this was just a trick of light or imagination. But the figure in the mirror stood perfectly still, even as I backed away.

It wasn‚Äôt me.

I stumbled out of the bathroom, slammed the door shut, and braced myself against it. My pulse was pounding in my ears, but I strained to listen. Was the whispering starting again? Was the voice waiting for me on the other side of the door?

Nothing.

Just silence.

I couldn‚Äôt stay in the flat. Not after that.

I spent the day wandering aimlessly around town, avoiding reflective surfaces like they were cursed. Every time I passed a shop window or a car mirror, I found myself holding my breath, terrified of what I might see.

By mid-afternoon, my thoughts began to settle, and with them came a desperate need for answers. Whatever was happening to me, it had started with that damned mirror. If I could figure out where it came from, maybe I could find a way to stop it.

The flat had come furnished when I moved in, including the mirror. I hadn‚Äôt given it a second thought back then. But now, the thought of it lingering there before me - silent, cracked, waiting - filled me with dread.

I decided to visit the letting agency.

The office was a cramped, fluorescent-lit space that smelled faintly of stale coffee and printer ink. A bored-looking woman at the front desk greeted me without looking up from her computer.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù she asked, her voice flat.

‚ÄúI, uh, had a question about the flat I‚Äôm renting,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúSpecifically about some of the furniture that came with it.‚Äù

She raised an eyebrow but didn‚Äôt press for details. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the address?‚Äù

I gave it to her, and she typed it into her system. After a moment, she frowned.

‚ÄúHuh. That flat‚Äôs been let out to half a dozen tenants in the past few years. Turnover‚Äôs unusually high.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

She shrugged. ‚ÄúNo idea. We just handle the leasing. Some people said they couldn‚Äôt settle in, others just disappeared without notice.‚Äù

The unease in my chest deepened. ‚ÄúDo you have any records about the furniture? Specifically a mirror in the bathroom?‚Äù

The woman sighed and reached for a stack of files. After a few minutes of flipping through paperwork, she pulled out a faded inventory list.

‚ÄúYeah, the mirror‚Äôs been there for years,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúCame with the flat when we started managing it. Probably older than the building itself.‚Äù

I hesitated, then asked the question that had been nagging at me. ‚ÄúWhat about the last tenant? The one before me?‚Äù

The woman glanced at the computer again. ‚ÄúClaire Wilkinson,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúShe moved out about a year ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know where she went?‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúNo forwarding address. She just‚Ä¶ left.‚Äù

I spent the rest of the afternoon trying to track down Claire Wilkinson. It wasn‚Äôt easy - she didn‚Äôt have much of an online presence, and the letting agency‚Äôs records didn‚Äôt give me much to go on. But after hours of searching, I found a single mention of her name in a local news archive.

The article was dated two years ago. It described a woman named Claire Wilkinson who had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital following what the paper called a ‚Äúpsychotic break.‚Äù

My stomach sank as I read the details. According to the article, Claire had become convinced that her reflection was watching her. She‚Äôd reportedly covered every mirror in her flat with black cloth and had even tried to break into a neighbor‚Äôs flat to smash their bathroom mirror.

The article ended with a chilling quote:

‚ÄúShe kept saying, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not me in the mirror. It‚Äôs not me.‚Äô‚Äù

I needed more.

The next day, I went to the library to see if I could dig up anything about the building itself - or the mirror. I spent hours sifting through old records, hoping for some clue that might explain what was happening to me.

Finally, I found something.

An old photograph of the building, dated 1912. In the photo, the building wasn‚Äôt a block of flats but a Victorian townhouse. And in one of the windows, I saw the unmistakable outline of a tall, rectangular mirror.

The caption beneath the photo read: ‚ÄúThe former residence of Elias Dunwich, renowned occultist and spiritualist.‚Äù

Elias Dunwich.

The name sent a chill down my spine. I‚Äôd come across it before during my late-night internet searches. Dunwich was a notorious figure in Victorian England, infamous for his experiments with the occult. He believed that mirrors were portals to other realms, capable of reflecting not just light but also the soul.

According to the accounts I‚Äôd read, Dunwich had conducted rituals using mirrors as ‚Äúgateways‚Äù to communicate with spirits. He claimed that reflections held power - power to reveal truths, to trap the unwary, and, sometimes, to let something else through.

Dunwich‚Äôs obsession with mirrors reportedly drove him to madness. Witnesses claimed he spent his final days locked in his home, muttering to himself and staring into a cracked mirror.

The house was sold after his death, and over the decades, it had been converted into flats.

I stared at the photograph, my hands trembling.

The mirror in my bathroom wasn‚Äôt just an antique. It was one of Dunwich‚Äôs ‚Äúgateways.‚Äù

I thought about the crack that had appeared seemingly overnight, growing larger with each passing day. I thought about the whispers, the distorted reflections, the dream of the voice saying, ‚ÄúLet me out.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt just a mirror.

It was a prison.

And something inside it wanted to escape.

I stood there, towel wrapped around my waist, staring at the mirror. I rubbed at the glass furiously, as if erasing it would undo what I‚Äôd seen.

The word was gone, but the crack remained, deep and jagged.

I avoided the bathroom for the rest of the day. The crack had changed something in me; it was a small fissure that had spread from the mirror to my mind, breaking my usual grip on logic and reason.

I knew what I had seen, but the rational part of me wanted to dismiss it. Stress. Sleep deprivation. Maybe even mold spores messing with my head - it had to be something tangible. Something real.

That evening, as I sat in the living room eating a ready meal, the flat felt different. The cozy clutter I‚Äôd grown used to - the overstuffed bookshelves, the well-worn armchair by the window, the coffee table scattered with old receipts and unopened post - now seemed oppressive. Like the walls were pressing inward.

I told myself I was being ridiculous.

The whispers started that night.

I had just switched off the bedside lamp and closed my eyes when I heard it: a faint, guttural murmur.

I sat up, heart pounding, and strained to listen. The sound was faint but unmistakable, like someone speaking in the next room.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out, my voice trembling.

The whispers stopped.

I waited a moment longer, then forced myself to lie back down. My brain was playing tricks on me, I decided. I needed to sleep.

But as soon as I closed my eyes, the whispers began again.

This time, I couldn‚Äôt ignore them. I got up, my legs shaking, and crept toward the bathroom. The sound grew louder as I approached, low and insistent.

When I opened the bathroom door, the whispers stopped abruptly, leaving only the faint hum of the extractor fan. The mirror was just as I‚Äôd left it, its crack glowing faintly in the dim light.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I whispered, my voice barely audible.

For a long moment, there was only silence.

Then, faintly, I heard it.

A voice.

‚ÄúLet me out.‚Äù

I slammed the door and backed away, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps.

It wasn‚Äôt real. It couldn‚Äôt be real.

I sat on the edge of my bed, staring at the closed bathroom door. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what I‚Äôd just heard. Was it a hallucination? Some kind of audio pareidolia - a trick of my brain interpreting random noise as words?

I wanted to believe that. I needed to believe it.

But deep down, I knew better.

The next morning, I tried to go about my routine as if nothing had happened. I brushed my teeth at the kitchen sink, avoiding the bathroom entirely.

At work, James cornered me in the break room again.

‚ÄúYou look like hell,‚Äù he said, pouring himself a cup of coffee. ‚ÄúSeriously, mate. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

I hesitated. How could I explain it to him? That my bathroom mirror was whispering to me? That I was starting to doubt my own sanity?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I lied.

He gave me a skeptical look. ‚ÄúYou sure? You‚Äôve been acting‚Ä¶ off. If you need someone to talk to‚Äù

‚ÄúI said I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I snapped, more harshly than I intended.

James held up his hands in surrender and walked away, leaving me alone with my thoughts.

That night, I dreamed of the mirror again.

This time, I was standing in front of it, unable to move. My reflection stared back at me, its face expressionless. The crack had grown larger, spreading like veins across the glass.

‚ÄúLet me out,‚Äù it whispered, its voice low and guttural.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling.

The reflection smirked. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a choice.‚Äù

I woke up gasping for air, the sound of my own voice echoing in my ears.

The whispers grew worse over the next few days. They followed me through the flat, faint and insistent, no matter where I went.

By the end of the week, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I grabbed a blanket and pillow and slept on the couch, as far away from the bathroom as I could get. But even there, the whispers found me.

I began to feel like I wasn‚Äôt alone in the flat. Shadows seemed to linger too long in the corners of my vision. Reflections in windows and polished surfaces seemed off, as if they were watching me.

One night, I caught my reflection in the microwave door as I heated up dinner.

It wasn‚Äôt moving.

I dropped the plate, shattering it on the floor, and stumbled back, my heart pounding.

The reflection was normal again. It moved when I moved, mimicking my every gesture. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was wrong.

Desperate for answers, I turned to the internet. I spent hours scrolling through forums and articles, looking for anything that might explain what was happening.

I found stories about haunted mirrors, about spirits trapped in reflective surfaces, about ancient superstitions that warned against staring into mirrors for too long.

None of it made me feel better.

One post caught my eye: a user describing a mirror they‚Äôd bought at a car-boot sale that seemed to distort their reflection. They claimed it had belonged to a Victorian occultist who used it as a ‚Äúgateway‚Äù to communicate with spirits.

I shivered and closed the browser tab.

That night, the whispers didn‚Äôt come.

For the first time in days, I slept peacefully.

When I woke up the next morning, I almost convinced myself it was over. Maybe I‚Äôd just imagined it all. Maybe it was stress or lack of sleep.

But when I stepped into the bathroom, the crack in the mirror was gone.

The glass was smooth and unbroken, as if it had never been there.

And in the reflection, I saw something that made my blood run cold.

My reflection was smiling.

But I wasn‚Äôt.

I am a 55F. Divorce begun 2019, finalized in 2021. Living in a large urban centre in Canada. Started online dating in fall 2024 after working through many issues.

A single platform - Match. It is going well for me. I have a system, and so far, I am happy with it. I engage in many coffee dates (I usually ask them, and pay/offer to pay). And a lot of second dates (I ask them and/or they ask me). Fewer third dates, because I am very conscious about compatibility in the long-term, and I don't want to short-change myself or hurt the other person unnecessarily.

I am considering having sex with my most recent third date (62M). He is lovely. I feel there is a potential for long-term compatibility.

I am very hesitant to engage in sex, primarily because my first two sexual experiences were non-consensual, the first time when I was 13 years old, and the second, when I was 19. The experience when I was 13 was with an older person I had trusted, and was bewildering, terrifying and painful. The experience when I was 19 was very violent and ended up with me in Emerg and I had nightmares for decades, and still do, occasionally, when my life is disrupted. I did not have the language or societal permission until I was in my 40s to be able to fully process these experiences. I know that may women will understand what I am saying and many men will not.

One of the reasons I stayed in a relationship that did not work is because I did not want to risk another sexual partner. My ex-husband was not good to me, but he was not violent, and that was preferable to me than the alternative.

I do not talk about my SA with anyone (other than my therapist who I have known for 25 years.) Not out of shame, but because I swore that no one can have anything from me that is not freely given. I once shared my story in a group and it ended up on a woman's instagram. I am not doing that again.

I had a sexual relationship with my ex-husband for about 20 years. I am prepared to take some accountability for some of the meh-ness, but not all. I worked very hard with a therapist to overcome my issues, only to discover that I might not be the only problem.

I plan to have a discussion with 62M about sexual health etc. Is this a good time to disclose? How much to disclose? With the caveat that I would really prefer to not disclose anything, but the nightmares surface occasionally, so I figure is there is an overnight stay, I should give a heads-up.

A,
I'm over you in all the important ways. I don't  cry over you or feel like you being here would fix anything. I don't want you back. Weeks go by where I don't think directly of you at all.

But the mark you left on my life and my soul IS permanent. We spent almost all our 20s together and the last two years of our teens. We grew up together. We built shared dreams of a life and the ghost of that life haunts me.

And strangely though I did try dating I just simply haven't the desire. I feel like I had my life's great love and it's gone and now I'm taking care of my elderly family members until they pass and then I will take care of my disabled sister until she passes and then I will take care of myself until I'm ready to go. Maybe in those later years I'll be ready for love again. 

There are still adventures to be had along the way. There's still a wonderful life stretching out ahead of me. 
I hope there's a wonderful life stretching out ahead of you.

Maybe one day we'll see each other again, have a cup of coffee and tell each other how the years have gone. But I doubt it. Neither of us is the same person anymore. It would be like strangers with matching memories, a reverse eternal sunshine.

I tried to recover from creatine.,"Long story short, I‚Äôve caved and returned to being a regular abuser of creatine. In the past, I only took a few scoops (you know, just because it was cool), but now it‚Äôs every day again.

When I was younger, I was told it would help build muscle. That‚Äôs when it started‚Äîjust a scoop here and there, nothing crazy. Fast forward a few months, and I was adding it to everything: protein shakes, morning coffee, even sprinkling it on my cereal. You ever had a creatine omelet? No? Me neither but there I was.

I took it with me through the army, and let me tell you‚Äîcreatine doesn‚Äôt just build muscle; it builds personality. At least, that‚Äôs what I told myself every time I felt the surge of confidence hit. I was running faster, lifting heavier, and recovering faster. But what nobody warned me about was how addictive it was I kept using and abusing my body until I broke. Halfway through using the butterfly machine maxed out my left arm gave out and I could hear an audible pop and squish. It took 6 months to finally start to use my arm again. That's when I knew I needed to quit.

The time I tried to quit, I thought, ‚ÄúHow hard could it be, I won't need it anymore?‚Äù I then quit cold turkey and it was exhilarating. I didn't have to remember to take it after food or exercise, I could just keep going on with my day without feeling like I missed something, and it was a huge money saver!

Then something happened. The psychological withdrawal I was never told came to rear it's ugly head. I‚Äôd walk by a bag of flour in the grocery store and think, ‚ÄúIf I mix that with water, maybe it‚Äôll work like creatine.‚Äù Friends started asking if I was okay because I kept muttering phrases like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just five grams. Just five grams! I need 10!

So here I am stuck and in need of some tips. I couldn't win the first time, but with the new knowledge this reddit exists I hope for a second chance.",1,1735436735.0,Creatine,0,1.0,False

How are you suppose to trust you can go to a place and get good food and proper service if there are so many lies about them?

1hol03a,https://i.redd.it/xhz5esadzo9e1.jpeg,How God Brought Me Back to Faith: My Journey to Jesus,"I‚Äôve spent a lot of time reflecting on different faiths and beliefs, but nothing compares to the profound experiences I‚Äôve had that brought me back to God and Jesus Christ. My journey hasn‚Äôt been straightforward, but it‚Äôs filled with moments that I can only attribute to God‚Äôs intervention. I‚Äôd like to share my story with you.

When I was 18, I dated a born-again Christian girl and started attending her church. At the time, I believed in God but not in organized religion. I felt that man-made rules often distorted the relationship we should have with God. I asked tough questions about Christianity‚Äîquestions about homosexuality, other religions like Islam, the afterlife, and the atrocities committed in Christianity‚Äôs name. I genuinely wanted to understand, but my questions weren‚Äôt well-received. Eventually, the church sent a letter to my girlfriend‚Äôs family, saying I was no longer welcome. That rejection left me disillusioned, and I walked away from God entirely. For years, I believed religion was man-made and a way to control people.

Fast forward to 2020: I started my business, which is now thriving, but in those early days, I worked as a food delivery driver to make ends meet. During this time, I listened to self-help books, many of which touched on God or spiritual energy. Slowly, I began to open up to the idea of a higher power again. Over the next two years, I explored spirituality and started to see small manifestations in my life. It wasn‚Äôt much, but it was enough to spark curiosity about religion again.

In 2022, I decided to take a deeper look into Christianity and Islam. I reached out to a mosque and expressed interest in visiting, but despite their initial response, I never received an invitation. At the same time, I remembered a person I knew who attended Life Church in Burnley years ago. I told myself, If I see him, I‚Äôll ask about going back to church. After four years of no contact, I walked into a Starbucks one day, and there he was, sitting with his wife, who works at the church. It felt like a sign.

I didn‚Äôt want to interrupt their coffee date, so I left without asking him. I thought, That was my chance, and I blew it. But just a few days later, I saw him again‚Äîthis time crossing the street in a nearby town. I pulled over, ran to him, and asked if I could come to church. He welcomed me with open arms. That Sunday, I went, feeling nervous and unsure, but I was immediately introduced to the Alpha course. It was a place where I could ask all my lingering questions without judgment. It was exactly what I needed. Looking back, I see how God was guiding me back home, even when I doubted.

Later that year, in October, I faced another challenge. I was struggling financially and had just been scammed out of money right before a trip to Germany. I was angry and screamed at God, asking why He was allowing these struggles. Despite my frustration, I went on the trip, and my friends supported me through it. I realized that sometimes God allows us to feel like we have nothing so we can recognize that He is everything.

Around the same time, my wife (who I married in 2021) was waiting for her UK visa to be approved. We‚Äôd been frustrated by delays and complications, and it felt like we were at a breaking point. One night in Germany, I sat down and gave my life to Jesus, saying, I‚Äôll give You my heart and my life, but please allow my wife to come over. Let us start our life together as a family.

The next morning, my wife received an email saying her visa was approved, and the very next day, she picked up her passport. This was unheard of‚Äîmost people in our situation waited weeks after approval to get their documents. By that weekend, her sister had paid for her ticket, and she flew to the UK. It was nothing short of a miracle.

God has been so good to me, even when I‚Äôve doubted, shouted, or walked away. These experiences‚Äîseeing my friend after four years, finding the Alpha course, being supported through financial struggles, and witnessing my wife‚Äôs visa miracle‚Äîare why I know Christianity and Jesus are the truth. I can‚Äôt explain these moments as coincidences. They are evidence of God‚Äôs love and His work in my life.

Advice Needed,"I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end with my housemate, and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. It started with small things and has now escalated to outright taking my belongings. I‚Äôm writing this not just to vent but also to get advice because confronting her has been so frustrating and unproductive.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened so far:

1. Coffee Pods: I had been saving stronger coffee pods for finals season, but when I went to get them, they were gone. We don‚Äôt share cabinets, and I later noticed her drinking coffee even though she doesn‚Äôt own any pods herself. I started counting my pods and confirmed she was taking them. Only after this did she finally buy her own.

2. Tuna Incident: I noticed my tuna was missing from the pantry. It wasn‚Äôt my other housemate because she has her own, and when I confronted the housemate in question, she denied it outright. I let it go to avoid more conflict, but I felt so disrespected.

3. My Missing Skirt: This was the breaking point for me. I was packing for the holidays and couldn‚Äôt find a black skirt I know I left in my room. After turning my room upside down and asking around, I decided to check her closet, and there it was‚Äîright there. We don‚Äôt share bedrooms, laundry, or storage, so the only way it ended up there was if she took it.

When I confronted her via text, she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just as surprised as you are to find that in my closet.‚Äù We sat down the next day, and while she apologized for ‚Äúeverything,‚Äù she still denied taking my skirt, insisting she‚Äôd never go into my room.

I feel stuck. She lies so easily, and it‚Äôs impossible to have an honest conversation with her. I want to believe people can change, but this behavior is beyond frustrating. I‚Äôve started locking up my stuff, but I hate that I have to live this way.

Has anyone else dealt with a housemate like this? How did you handle it? Would it be worth addressing this publicly or involving a landlord/or even the school? We‚Äôre both in the NYU Dental program and it sucks that I have to deal with this when I just want to focus on my studies as well. I just feel so disrespected and defeated.

1hoktie,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hoktie/aitah_33f_for_not_wanting_to_share_weed_with_my/,AITAH (33f) for not wanting to share weed with my boyfriend (35m),"Here is some context. 

We both have had a serious relationship in like 7-10 years. We have been dating for 10 months and I am pretty sure we both want to marry each other. He is handsome and mostly kind and considerate. Brings me gifts, helps me do chores around the house (he is always at mine every weekend and sometimes during the week because he doesn‚Äôt like his apartment with his buddy), and is just really nice to me always. 

One of the things I struggle with the most is splitting things fairly in a relationship due to financial trauma from my parents. I do not in any way consider myself a selfish person and love to cook for him, but him coffee when we are out, pick up snacks I know he will like, like to pay for dinner out every other time, etc. Basically I know I am giving and don‚Äôt expect the other person to give give give. I like it to feel equal and like we are both over giving (best scenario). I know that is not reality though and most couples go through tension when it comes to money and resources.

We started dating and he didn‚Äôt smoke weed and I did. He started to smoke weed again because of me. And as time went on I would share with him but he would smoke a lot more so I told him we needed to split the costs because I was going through it so fast. Then he really started smoking more and I told him he needed to get his own. Tension was starting to rise because I was coming off stingy. Now we are in a deadlock because he got his own, smoked it all by himself, and comes over and still smokes mine. 

To him I am keeping tabs and being a Scrooge and to me I think he is being inconsiderate. In my past relationships when arguments like this would happen all the other nice things would be used as ammo from both sides and I am so terribly scared of those unhealthy arguments starting. 

It started to leak into other things like him not liking to drive anywhere because his car is crappy and he genuinely doesn‚Äôt want to drive. Groceries started to be a problem because he eats 3X as much as me and it seems he thinks we should split food 50/50. I have expressed I am not comfortable with that and he‚Äôs been bringing groceries over more which is helping. And he just is generally more wasteful and consuming food, sugary drinks, and weed in my perspective borderline obsessively. I think this part might be me being judgmental and freaked out by addictive qualities in people (both of our fathers were addicts)

I can feel the frustration and tension growing. We had a good night out with friends and he came to the conclusion on his own that he‚Äôs been smoking his own weed and then mine and it‚Äôs coming off inconsiderate. But then the next day he was out and wanted mine and I said no because I am fed up. Now everything is uncomfortable and I don‚Äôt know how healthy couples handle these issues. Please be kind I am really trying to work through not running away from this because I want to have an easy give and take relationship where we both feel taken care of. I want us to move in together in June of 2025 when his lease is up and I love him because he is genuinely an amazing person and probably the best person I will ever find.

1hokszj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dickssportinggoods/comments/1hokszj/corporate_complaints_try_running_the_stores_first/,Corporate Complaints? Try Running the Stores First,"I read Glassdoor reviews from time to time, and this one (linked below) made me lol.

Wow, imagine how¬†hard¬†it must be to sit in an office all day, sipping coffee, and deciding how to cut store hours. Must be exhausting! Honestly, I‚Äôd trade places with these corporate folks in a heartbeat if¬†this¬†is what counts as a ""bad experience"" these days.

Meanwhile, in the stores, we‚Äôre running around trying to do the work of three people because those hour cuts have real consequences. But sure, let‚Äôs all feel bad for the poor corporate employees who have to deal with ""metrics and goals.""

It‚Äôs ridiculous to see complaints like this when the reality for store employees is so much tougher. At least in corporate, you‚Äôre sitting comfortably in the corporate headquarters, not dealing with customers yelling at you because you‚Äôre the only person covering three departments.

If this is what corporate folks think is ""difficult,"" I‚Äôd love for them to try working a closing shift during BTS or the holiday season. Then maybe they‚Äôd see what the rest of us are dealing with.

  
**Copy/paste of Glassdoor review:**

*Cons*

*If you‚Äôre considering a role in finance here, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere. After spending years with the company, my eyes have been seriously opened to just how toxic and unfulfilling the culture is. This is not a place where employees are respected or valued. The finance culture is cold and impersonal. In all the time I worked there, I can count on one hand the number of times someone asked me how I was doing or how my weekend was. The environment is strictly transactional‚Äîthere‚Äôs no effort to build personal connections or foster a sense of community. You‚Äôre viewed as a number, nothing more. Leadership shows little to no interest in employees as people or in supporting their growth. Management often talks out of both sides of their mouths. They‚Äôll claim they welcome change and acknowledge that things badly need to improve, but when it comes to making actual progress, they‚Äôre full of excuses. Whether it‚Äôs ‚Äútiming,‚Äù ‚Äúresources,‚Äù or ‚Äúprocesses,‚Äù there‚Äôs always a reason why meaningful change can‚Äôt happen. This creates a stagnant and frustrating environment where employees are told to accept the status quo, no matter how broken it is. If you‚Äôre asked to take on significant additional responsibilities, don‚Äôt expect to be financially rewarded for it. Instead, you‚Äôll be told it‚Äôs for your ‚Äúown growth‚Äù‚Äîan excuse leadership uses to avoid paying people what they deserve and act like they‚Äôre paying it out of their own pocket. Recognition for hard work or going above and beyond is virtually nonexistent, and certainly don‚Äôt expect a simple ‚Äúthank you‚Äù for anything. It‚Äôs clear that the focus is on squeezing as much as possible from employees without giving anything back in return. Growth and development are simply not priorities here. Few leaders care about helping their teams advance in their careers or acquire new skills. Instead of collaboration or mentorship, the focus is on meeting expectations and delivering results, regardless of the personal toll it takes on employees. Leadership is self-serving and out of touch. They care about themselves and their own advancement above all else, with no regard for the morale or well-being of their teams. The lack of empathy and support from management creates a rough, isolating culture that leaves employees burnt out and feeling disposable. My advice: Don‚Äôt work here. You deserve to be in a workplace where you‚Äôre treated with respect, where your efforts are recognized, and where your well-being matters. This company will not provide that. If you‚Äôre on the fence, save yourself the disappointment and find an employer that values its people as more than just a means to an end.*

*Advice to Management*

*Start treating your employees like human beings. Invest in their growth, acknowledge their contributions, and foster a culture where people feel supported and respected. Stop asking employees to take on more responsibility without fairly compensating them. And if you‚Äôre going to talk about the importance of change, stop making excuses and start following through. Until you do, you‚Äôll continue to lose good employees and damage the company‚Äôs reputation.*

1hoksvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hoksvh/i_24f_technically_stalked_my_nowfiance_26m_for_4/,I (24f) technically stalked my now-fiance (26m) for 4 years before we dated?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons and this is actually an insane story.

At the tail end of 2017, I logged onto then-Twitter and saw my friend liking this actor's tweet. Let's call him Gus. Gus was from a completely different city (like a plane ride away) and I had no connection with him whatsoever other than my friend being a fan of his work/movies. I just thought ""He's hot. I want him."" and I guess began my not-so-convoluted-long-term-plan on getting him.

I started with finding his Instagram, scrolling through his following to find someone I could ""use to get to him."" and found a decently attractive guy that I could ""befriend online"" and ""maybe e-date for a short time"" just to get my foot through the door. Let's call him Luis

I messaged Luis and we instantly hit it off. We talked for a bout 2 months and called almost every day for hours. Planning to meet when I fly over for the summer break and whatnot. I knew he was friends with Gus irl, but pretended not to know Gus everytime he mentioned him. He'd tell me about his day like, ""oh I went to the bowling alley with Gus"" and I'd say something like ""which one is that again? the one with the blue hair?"" and he'd have to remind me ""no the other one."" This went on a few times until I ""finally"" remembered which one he was.

I also knew that he talked about me with Gus. Whenever they'd play videogames together, he'd tell him he'd have to leave soon 'cause he's gonna call me or spend time with me which kinda annoyed Gus a little bit. He would then call me and jokingly say ""Gus is mad at you for stealing me"" and shit like that. I thought, ""Okay now he knows about my existence, it shouldn't be this hard now""

While this was happening, I would stalk Gus's Spotify, Twitter, Instagram from time to time. I would pick and choose songs from his playlists and create my own using them. I'd watch films he liked, listetened to albums he liked and I steered clear of movies he was in 'cause I'm supposed to ""have no idea who he was,"" crazy, right? Well it gets crazier.

Luis and I broke it off. It just sorta fizzled out but we remained good friends and he started seeing someone else. Easy start to my 2018, no bad blood. I continued to check in on Gus's Spotify, made sure I was updated on what he liked, but never actually interacted with him anywhere. This went on and off for a bit until 2019.

In May, 2019, I moved to the city that Gus lived in after graduating high school a few months prior and saving up enough (to be fair, I've wanted to live here way before this whole thing. It was the ""big city"" that small town girls dreamt of). I didn't really go to college, I was making good money from my remote job (that I did while in school) and it allowed me to uproot my life and move. But I never orchestrated a meet-cute with Gus. I just ""knew I'll run into him somewhere at some point.""

I slowly got back in contact with Luis, becaming closer friends with him and the girl he dated after me, Sam. We all would interact with each others posts, tweets, etc. And at some point, Luis and Sam started inviting me to hang out (with other friends). House parties, concerts, raves, coffee dates, etc. For a while I forgot about the whole Gus thing and actually met friends who liked me and wanted to show me around. I focused on building those friendships and new ones, working, furnishing my new house, seeing the new city, casual dating, everything else. I didn't see Gus during this time, 'cause he was always busy with fillming, or out of the country, but at that point, I didn't care anymore lol.

Then in mid 2021, I went to a show with Sam. She said some of her friends were performing and wanted me to come. I said for sure and got there thinking it would be just the two of us.

An hour into the show, Luis walks in

with Gus.

Luis: ""Sorry we're late! Traffic was insane""

Gus: ""ITS YOU"" (points at me)

Me: ""its...me!"" (I blurted out, awkwardly laughing)

Gus: ""I've been wanting to meet you. These guys have told me so much about you!"" (he hugs me and hugs Sam)

We talked a little bit. He was so sweet and VERY friendly in person that I started feeling really bad about plotting against him for years. We hit it off really well (platonically?) and exchanged socials after the show.

A few days later, he DMed me and invited me to see a movie with Luis, pointed out that he saw my Letterboxd favorites and that he thinks I'd like it. I went and had a blast and we kept hanging out after that. He said we had the same interests, like, we listened to the same artists (whoops) and I had his favorite movie in my top 4 list (WHOOPS) and he was glad I hadn't seen the stupid films he's been in and didn't really know who he was after having a bad experience with a stalker fan girl a year prior (W H O O P S)

About 6 months into being friends and hanging out, he asked me out. I said yes and now, 3-point-something years later, we're engaged.

I feel terrible and I've never told anyone about this and at this point, I really don't think I should. This is going to the grave with me.. Peace out.",2,1735435772.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,1.0,False

1hokqsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hokqsw/wibta_for_ending_things_with_this_guy/,WIBTA for ending things with this guy?,"So I (22F) first met James (24M) around 6 months ago in London, at the start of summer. We got talking in a club, and chatted the whole night.. we got on so well, we decided to go for a coffee together the following week. That was 15 dates ago, and we‚Äôve had a really nice time together. I genuinely enjoy his company and could really see this going somewhere.. however, the only issue is his communication skills.

James is awful at texting. At first I thought it was just with me, but no, it‚Äôs absolutely everyone. Over summer we‚Äôd barely communicate in between our dates, and he‚Äôd maybe contact me once every other day to check in and organise our next meeting. Which was fine at that point, because we weren‚Äôt serious yet and I‚Äôd still hear from him occasionally. But recently it‚Äôs become way worse..

As of late October, I‚Äôm now in my final year of university, and he has also just started his PhD. Unfortunately, James really dislikes his PhD due to the insane workload and the work not being something he enjoys. For context, James is a very motivated person. During summer, there was a period of time where we didn‚Äôt speak because he was locked in and trying to perfect his masters thesis (he did tell me about this and i understood, but we didn‚Äôt see each-other for a whole month!). He gets really into his work.. which can be admirable, but it seems like he really lets it consume him. Because he dislikes the PhD so much he plans on quitting it, so he is currently trying to secure a full-time job whilst doing his PhD work and attending lectures and seminars and whatnot. And quite frankly.. he doesn‚Äôt seem to be coping well. 

The last time we met (November 17th), we started talking a bit about the future. He told me he didn‚Äôt date casually and was looking for a life partner (which was great cause same), but he didn‚Äôt want to enter a commitment or get into a relationship whilst he was stressing over all of this job and PhD stuff. And I get it.. career stuff can be awfully stressful. I also brought up the communication, and how not having consistent communication in a relationship was a deal breaker for me. He apologised and said he wanted to improve on it, and that it‚Äôd get better. I left that date feeling really optimistic..

But afterwards, he started to become quite flakey with plans and his communication just got worse and worse. For example, we planned to go to Christmas markets together, and he cancelled the day before because he had a last minute family party. And when he rearranged, he then cancelled again because he had a lot to do. It had been like this previously a few times as well in the past, but now it‚Äôs become a consistent thing. He then sent a long message about how he was struggling to balance things, the summary of it read ‚ÄúEssentially, I really enjoy seeing you, but am struggling with life to see you as often as I‚Äôd like if that makes sense, and realise that‚Äôs completely unfair‚Äù.

He seemed genuinely really apologetic and open about the situation, and i understand life can get in the way sometimes. But then‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt hear from him, for a whole month. No reply or message for 30 days. I only recently heard from him, when I sent a second follow up message saying ""merry Christmas"" on the 25th. He responded a bit, asking how I was and how the holidays have been. I replied to that message 3 days ago now‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm starting to think he has simply lost interest, and was too much of a wuss to say anything. This is the only issue we‚Äôve had, in person being with this man has been absolutely amazing. He treats me really really well, is kind and intelligent, and we have the best time together and the sweetest dates imaginable. Furthermore we also have insane chemistry both in and out of the bedroom (nudge nudge wink wink). I‚Äôve honestly started to develop feelings, I was starting to feel like he could be my person and I potentially would want a future with him. But if I can‚Äôt rely on him to keep his word or simply reply to a simple text message.. how will I be able to rely on him in a commitment?

If it was anyone else, I would‚Äôve cut off contact months ago. But this guy seems genuinely different (I have a good senses for these things), this is the only red flag. So am currently deciding if it‚Äôs best to end things before I get more hurt by this situation.. What would you do in my position? WIBTA for ending things with him?

---------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is vital for your overall health and wellness. Many people underestimate the impact that proper hydration can have on their bodies. Drinking adequate amounts of water daily can lead to significant transformations in health. Here‚Äôs how simply drinking water can change your life for the better.

### Improved Physical Performance

Your body is largely composed of water, making hydration essential for optimal physical performance. When you're dehydrated, you may experience fatigue, reduced endurance, and decreased coordination. Staying hydrated can enhance your energy levels, allowing you to perform better in workouts and daily tasks.

Water helps regulate your body temperature, lubricates your joints, and supports muscle function. By keeping your fluid levels in check, you can push through your workouts more effectively and recover faster afterwards.

### Boosted Mental Clarity

Not only is water crucial for your body, but it also plays a significant role in brain function. Studies show that even mild dehydration can lead to difficulties in focus, concentration, and memory retention. When you're well-hydrated, you are likely to think more clearly and make better decisions.

- Improves focus and alertness
- Enhances memory function
- Supports mood stability

So, if you often find yourself feeling foggy or struggling to concentrate, sipping on water throughout the day could make a noticeable difference.

### Weight Management

Hydration can also play a significant role in weight management. Drinking water before meals can help you feel fuller, reducing the likelihood of overeating. Sometimes, your body confuses thirst with hunger. Staying hydrated can help curb those unnecessary cravings and support your weight loss efforts.

Additionally, replacing sugary drinks with water eliminates extra calories and sugar intake, making it easier to maintain a balanced diet. Here are some tips to incorporate more water into your routine:

- Keep a reusable water bottle with you.
- Set reminders to drink water throughout the day.
- Add slices of fruit for flavor.

### Healthy Skin

Drinking enough water is vital for maintaining healthy skin. Hydrated skin looks plumper, more elastic, and youthful. Dehydration can lead to dry, flaky skin and increased signs of aging.

Water flushes out toxins, helps maintain your skin's moisture balance, and can even help reduce acne and other skin issues. By prioritizing hydration, you can enjoy a clearer complexion and healthier skin overall.

### Detoxification

Your kidneys need water to function correctly. They filter waste from your blood and help eliminate toxins through urine. Drinking an adequate amount of water daily can support your kidneys in their filtering role, promoting overall kidney health.

Furthermore, hydration aids digestion. It helps break down food so that your body can absorb nutrients effectively. If you're struggling with constipation, increasing your water intake can often help resolve the issue.

### Heart Health

Hydration can even contribute to heart health. When dehydrated, your blood volume decreases, which can strain your heart as it works harder to pump blood throughout your body. Drinking water ensures that your blood remains at a healthy viscosity level, supporting cardiovascular health.

A well-hydrated body can better manage its systems, reducing the risk of heart-related issues.

Water into your daily routine is a simple but powerful step towards enhancing your health and wellness. Remember to listen to your body and drink water consistently throughout the day. Whether you are working out, concentrating on tasks, or just trying to stay healthy, don‚Äôt underestimate the transformative power of water. By prioritizing your hydration, you can enjoy numerous benefits and feel your best every day.

The Science Behind Hydration: Why It Matters
--------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, but do you truly understand the science behind hydration and why it matters? Staying properly hydrated can significantly influence your physical health, mental clarity, and overall well-being. Yet, many of us overlook just how crucial this simple act of drinking water is for our bodies. Let's delve into the significance of hydration and its profound effects on our health.

To understand hydration, it‚Äôs helpful to grasp how water functions in the body. Approximately 60% of our body weight is made up of water, which plays a crucial role in numerous bodily functions:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Water helps maintain a stable body temperature. When we sweat, we lose water, but this process cools our body effectively.
- **Supports Digestion:** Proper hydration is critical for the digestive process. Water helps break down food, making nutrients more accessible to your body.
- **Transports Nutrients:** Blood is primarily composed of water, and it carries oxygen and nutrients to cells while removing waste products.
- **Joint Lubrication:** Water acts as a lubricant for your joints, reducing friction and ensuring smooth movement.

Now, let's take a closer look at how being adequately hydrated can transform your health and wellness.

The Impact of Hydration on Mental Clarity and Mood
--------------------------------------------------

Every sip of water you take goes far beyond just quenching your thirst; it plays a crucial role in supporting your mental clarity and enhancing your mood. Staying properly hydrated can significantly impact how you feel and think, helping you stay sharp and content throughout your day.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Our bodies are made up of about 60% water. This essential element is vital for numerous bodily functions, including regulating temperature, maintaining joint health, and facilitating the effective transport of nutrients in our system. But did you know that hydration also significantly influences our mental states?

### How Hydration Affects Mental Clarity

When you‚Äôre poorly hydrated, even slight dehydration can lead to a drop in your cognitive performance. Research reveals that just a 2% dip in body water can cause problems with concentration, focus, and short-term memory. So, what are the signs that dehydration is affecting your mental clarity?

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Difficulty concentrating:** If you struggle to keep your focus on tasks, it could be that your brain is seeking more water.
- **Slower reaction time:** Dehydration can slow down your cognitive processes, making you less responsive.
- **Forgetfulness:** When your brain is not getting enough hydration, you might find it harder to remember things.
- **Decision-making struggles:** An unclear mind might lead to poor choices, impacting your daily activities.

On the other hand, when you are well-hydrated, your cognitive functions tend to improve. Your brain can communicate better with the rest of your body, leading to enhanced focus and sharper thinking. You can remember names, finish your work on time, and tackle complex problems without feeling overwhelmed.

### The Role of Hydration in Mood Regulation

Hydration isn‚Äôt just about thinking clearly; it also plays a key role in how you feel emotionally. Studies have shown that even mild dehydration can contribute to feelings of fatigue, anxiety, and irritability. Here are some ways hydration influences your mood:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Energizing effects:** A well-hydrated body can help in reducing fatigue, keeping your energy levels sustained throughout the day.
- **Stress reduction:** Staying hydrated may lower stress levels, allowing you to approach challenges with a better mindset.
- **Improved mood:** Research has indicated a clear correlation between hydration status and mood, suggesting that drinking enough water can lead to more positive feelings.

When you are well-hydrated, you are more likely to handle stress better and feel a sense of well-being. Conversely, when you are dehydrated, your body produces more stress hormones like cortisol, which can lead to heightened feelings of anxiety or grouchiness. By ensuring you drink enough water throughout the day, you're creating a supportive environment for a happier mood.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

Now that you understand the importance of hydration, how can you make sure you‚Äôre drinking enough water every day? Here are some practical strategies:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/

- Keep a refillable water bottle with you to track your intake.
- Infuse your water with fruits or herbs to make it more enjoyable.
- Pair drinking water with meal times to establish a routine.
- Observe your body: pay attention to your thirst signals.

By implementing these strategies, you will be more likely to achieve optimal hydration, enhancing not only your cognitive abilities but also your overall mood.

Remember, making a few simple changes to your daily routine can lead to lasting improvements in how you think and feel. Prioritize drinking water, and witness the transformative effects it can have on your health and wellness.

Common Myths About Drinking Water Debunked
------------------------------------------

Many people have heard various myths about drinking water that can distort our understanding of its importance. Let's dive into some of these misconceptions and clarify the facts surrounding hydration.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 1: You must drink eight glasses of water a day

One of the most common beliefs is that you need to drink exactly eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, also known as the ""8x8 rule."" While hydration is vital, the amount you need can vary based on factors like age, gender, climate, and activity level. Instead of focusing on a specific number, listen to your body. Thirst is a natural indicator that you need fluids. Foods like fruits and vegetables also contribute to your overall intake.

### Myth 2: All fluids hydrate you equally

It‚Äôs a common thought that any liquid counts toward your hydration goals. While it‚Äôs true that different beverages do have hydration properties, some can also contribute to dehydration. Beverages high in caffeine or alcohol can lead to increased urination, which might offset their hydrating effects. Water remains the best choice for hydration, ensuring your body functions properly.

### Myth 3: Drinking water can help you lose weight

While drinking water can support weight loss efforts, it isn't a magic solution. Staying well-hydrated can help you feel full, which may reduce the intake of high-calorie beverages. However, studies show that simply drinking more water without making any other dietary changes won‚Äôt lead to significant weight loss. Adopting a balanced diet along with proper hydration will yield better results.

### Myth 4: You can‚Äôt drink too much water

While staying hydrated is crucial, it is possible to overdo it. Drinking excessive amounts of water in a short time lets your kidneys struggle to keep up. This can lead to a rare condition called hyponatremia, where sodium levels in your blood become dangerously low. Always be mindful of your consumption, especially during intense exercise or in heat.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 5: You only need to drink water when you're thirsty

Feeling thirsty is a sign that your body is already in need of fluids, but waiting until then might not be sufficient for maintaining optimal hydration throughout the day. It's a good idea to drink water regularly, even if you don‚Äôt feel thirsty. Setting reminders throughout the day can help establish good hydration habits.

### Myth 6: Clear urine is a sign of perfect hydration

Many believe that having completely clear urine means you are perfectly hydrated. In truth, urine color can be influenced by numerous factors, including diet and medications. A pale yellow color generally signals good hydration, while darker hues may indicate a need for additional fluids. Instead of fixating on clarity, focus on how you feel overall.

### Myth 7: Drinking water before meals harms digestion

Some think that consuming water before meals impairs digestion by diluting stomach acid. On the contrary, drinking water can aid digestion by helping to break down food so nutrients can be absorbed. However, it‚Äôs wise to avoid drinking large amounts directly before or during a meal, as it may cause you to feel overly full and lead to discomfort.

### Myth 8: Bottled water is healthier than tap water

Many people assume bottled water is cleaner and more beneficial than tap water. However, that's not always the case. In many areas, tap water is subject to more stringent testing than bottled water. Additionally, bottled water can come in single-use plastic bottles that contribute to environmental pollution. If you're concerned about your tap water quality, consider using a filter for peace of mind.

### Clearing Up Misconceptions

Understanding the facts about hydration can help you make better choices for your health. Remember these myths and keep your hydration habits in check. Staying informed is the key to making a significant difference in your well-being.

### Conclusion

Embracing the power of hydration can significantly enhance your health and wellness. The benefits of drinking water go beyond mere thirst quenching; they touch every facet of your well-being. Understanding the science behind hydration reveals that our bodies rely on water to function optimally, supporting everything from digestion to energy levels. By incorporating simple strategies like carrying a water bottle or setting reminders, you can effortlessly increase your daily water intake.

Moreover, staying well-hydrated not only fuels your physical activities but also boosts your mental clarity and mood. Many people underestimate how even slight dehydration can affect cognitive function, leading to feelings of fatigue or irritability. That's why prioritizing water can lead to a brighter, more focused mindset.

By making a conscious effort to prioritize hydration, you empower yourself to feel better mentally and physically, paving the way for a healthier future. So, why wait?

1hoknpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hoknpt/should_i_break_things_off_with_this_guy/,Should I break things off with this guy..?,"So I (22F) first met James (24M) around 6 months ago in London, at the start of summer. We got talking in a club, and chatted the whole night.. we got on so well, we decided to go for a coffee together the following week. That was 15 dates ago, and we‚Äôve had a really nice time together. I genuinely enjoy his company and could really see this going somewhere.. however, the only issue is his communication skills.

James is awful at texting. At first I thought it was just with me, but no, it‚Äôs absolutely everyone. Over summer we‚Äôd barely communicate in between our dates, and he‚Äôd maybe contact me once every other day to check in and organise our next meeting. Which was fine at that point, because we weren‚Äôt serious yet and I‚Äôd still hear from him occasionally. But recently it‚Äôs become way worse..

As of late October, I‚Äôm now in my final year of university, and he has also just started his PhD. Unfortunately, James really dislikes his PhD due to the insane workload and the work not being something he enjoys. For context, James is a very motivated person. During summer, there was a period of time where we didn‚Äôt speak because he was locked in and trying to perfect his masters thesis (he did tell me about this and i understood, but we didn‚Äôt see each-other for a whole month!). He gets really into his work.. which can be admirable, but it seems like he really lets it consume him. Because he dislikes the PhD so much he plans on quitting it, so he is currently trying to secure a full-time job whilst doing his PhD work and attending lectures and seminars and whatnot. And quite frankly.. he doesn‚Äôt seem to be coping well. 

The last time we met (November 17th), we started talking a bit about the future. He told me he didn‚Äôt date casually and was looking for a life partner (which was great cause same), but he didn‚Äôt want to enter a commitment or get into a relationship whilst he was stressing over all of this job and PhD stuff. And I get it.. career stuff can be awfully stressful. I also brought up the communication, and how not having consistent communication in a relationship was a deal breaker for me. He apologised and said he wanted to improve on it, and that it‚Äôd get better. I left that date feeling really optimistic..

But afterwards, he started to become quite flakey with plans and his communication just got worse and worse. For example, we planned to go to Christmas markets together, and he cancelled the day before because he had a last minute family party. And when he rearranged, he then cancelled again because he had a lot to do. It had been like this previously a few times as well in the past, but now it‚Äôs become a consistent thing. He then sent a long message about how he was struggling to balance things, the summary of it read ‚ÄúEssentially, I really enjoy seeing you, but am struggling with life to see you as often as I‚Äôd like if that makes sense, and realise that‚Äôs completely unfair‚Äù.

He seemed genuinely really apologetic and open about the situation, and i understand life can get in the way sometimes. But then‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt hear from him, for a whole month. No reply or message for 30 days. I only recently heard from him, when I sent a second follow up message saying ""merry Christmas"" on the 25th. He responded a bit, asking how I was and how the holidays have been. I replied to that message 3 days ago now‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm starting to think he has simply lost interest, and was too much of a wuss to say anything. This is the only issue we‚Äôve had, in person being with this man has been absolutely amazing. He treats me really really well, is kind and intelligent, and we have the best time together and the sweetest dates imaginable. Furthermore we also have insane chemistry both in and out of the bedroom (nudge nudge wink wink). I‚Äôve honestly started to develop feelings, I was starting to feel like he could be my person and I potentially would want a future with him. But if I can‚Äôt rely on him to keep his word or simply reply to a simple text message.. how will I be able to rely on him in a commitment?

If it was anyone else, I would‚Äôve cut off contact months ago. But this guy seems genuinely different (I have a good senses for these things), this is the only red flag. So am currently deciding if it‚Äôs best to end things before I get more hurt by this situation.. What would you do in my position?

The paper filtered coffee seems to taste smoother and richer somehow, though I also liked the coffee made with the reusable in the MM.

1hokepf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPS/comments/1hokepf/how_do_i_make_cps_help_me_and_my_younger_siblings/,How do I make CPS help me and my younger siblings?,"Hi. This might be long, I'm sorry. 

I'm 17M, my two younger siblings are 13M & 5F. My sister is autistic (still awaiting assessment, but she hss all of the signs) and my brother has diagnosed ADHD, probable ASD, and ""anger issues"" that in my opinion are just meltdowns.

I'm struggling. My sister does nothing but scream. She enjoys seeing us upset. I know that isn't really whats happening but its what it seems like. She follows us around, screaming and giggling about it. She loves seeing people hurt and crying. My brother is really badly effected so he's her favorite victim. She enjoys backing him into corners and screaming until he's sobbing and wets himself.

I'm managing to the best of my ability but I can't watch him 24/7, even though I try. 

He has lashed out at her physically twice. The first time I made a post about it ( https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/t6xjqWAim2 ). Not sure if you can see as it was removed, but thought I'd link anyway.

Since then she's started screaming again and my brother has gotten a lot worse (another post for more context - https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/1AzK9WMYNz ).

In short, the first time he was backed into a corner by her while I was trying to deal with the dog. He's attacked my sister before so I needed to get him outside. He ended up shoving her away and she stumbled and his her head on the coffee table. She was fine, not even a bump, but they took her to the ER anyway.

The second time was a few days ago. I made the mistake of trying to shower (they were both asleep) but I guess the shower woke my sister up. She started her usual annoying routine and my brother attempted to physically remove her from the room. She pushed against the door & he slammed it, trapping her fingers. No injuries, just bruising, but obviously there was a lot of sobbing on both ends.

My brother frequently talks about wanting to die. Daily. Every time she starts. My sister is awful to be around but is obviously suffering a great deal too, and the longer this continues the more worried I am. My brother is one thing, but the dog could kill her in two seconds flat. Parent's refuse to rehome or give him to my dad.

I've told my therapist, my brother has told his anger management guy (I wouldn't even call him a therapist atp), I've told teachers. My dad has reported what I've told him to CPS I know. But nothing has happened. 

I am ready to finally make my own report, with photos and videos if needed. I just need to know what will make them listen and how I can keep my brother with me. My dad is willing to take us both (and the dog) in. Although at this point I think they'd just put our dog down.

If we're going to be separated I don't know if I'll report it. He's fragile and I don't think he'd cope. He doesn't trust anyone except me at the moment. Is there anything I can do to make sure that doesn't happen? 

Sorry if anything is missing or confusing. She doesn't let us sleep and I'm exhausted.

If there's anywhere else I could crosspost this for more advice (unrelated to CPS, even just to help them both) I'd appreciate the redirection too.",2,1735434577.0,CPS,3,0.75,False

Where do i go from here?,"So, I woke up this morning and was relaxing in bed and my boyfriend brought me coffee, I didn‚Äôt notice till then and I looked down and saw a necklace charm, immediately I was confused and thought it was mine. But I hadn‚Äôt seen it before. We talked briefly and he just went ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go throw it out‚Äù. 

I of course was put off by it so later on, he saw I was off and asked if I wanted to talk. We talked for about 30 minutes and I went through his phone in great detail. He kept claiming he had no clue where on earth that necklace charm came from. His phone revealed absolutely nothing of use to me. There were some photos with his ex and dating app profiles in his photos but they were from before we got together (6 months ago). My boyfriend did have some issues watching some nsfw content but when we discussed how unwell it made me feel he has since ceased to do all that.

My boyfriend hasn‚Äôt since given me any reason to not trust him but, these things don‚Äôt just magically appear, we don‚Äôt live together and I wear limited jewelry to his house and I think as a girl i‚Äôm gonna recognize a charm that‚Äôs mine?? Where do I even go from here?? Where did this thing come from! I feel so silly for this and don‚Äôt wanna dwell on it too long and give him bad vibes but how do i just move past this..

It‚Äôs also my first time traveling alone, and I tend to get overwhelmed and anxious easily if I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

General Questions:

I booked the 5:00 AM train from Brisbane to Sydney while in the Gold Coast. Is this time in Brisbane or Sydney time? For my return trip, I‚Äôm leaving from Wyong at 4:15 PM, also booked while in the Gold Coast. Will the time be in Brisbane or Sydney time, and does it adjust automatically when I‚Äôm in NSW?

Since I booked on the NSW TrainLink site, does the 5:00 AM time shown reflect Brisbane or NSW time? How early do I need to check in my bag before the train departs? Once it‚Äôs checked in, will I store it myself on the train, or does staff handle it?


Day Travel Questions:

What are the best ways to pass the time during a daytime ride? Is the food on the train worth buying, or should I bring my own? Is coffee available, and if so, how is it? I can handle medium-strength coffee but not strong‚Äîwould it suit me? Also, is the coffee made with a machine or a plunger? Are there any good stops along the way for food?


Night Travel Question:

What‚Äôs the best way to stay comfortable on an overnight trip? Are the seats good for sleeping, or should I bring extra items? Any tips for getting a good rest during the ride?

1hokapt,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hokapt/observations_fresh_roasted_vs_generic_espresso/,Observations: Fresh Roasted vs Generic Espresso Beans,"A very subjective post but interested in the discussion...

I've recently become more interested in espresso and have been experimenting more with a new semi-auto machine. I've always had a super-auto machine and just bought beans I liked from major grocers - the coffee was always consistent and ok but not amazing. 

Since I started using my new semi-auto machine and bought fresh roasted espresso beans, I've noticed the coffee is great at first and much superior to a grocery store bean (obviously); but, after a few weeks, the quality and taste degrades considerably (almost to a point where it's not enjoyable). 

On the other hand, when I use generic grocery store beans (think Lavazza, Illy, etc), I notice the taste is OK and nothing compared to the fresh roast bean; HOWEVER, the bean remains more consistent and has greater longevity. i.e, I can use the bean and continue to get the same taste and experience weeks and even a month or so after the bag has been opened. 

Am I crazy here or have others experienced the same?  I understand a bean degrades and reacts to oxygen and many factors but it's noticeable difference in longevity. ",0,1735434236.0,espresso,1,0.5,False

1hok8mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonBrandReviews/comments/1hok8mv/product_review_caf√©_bustelo/,Product Review Caf√© Bustelo,"The Rich Flavor Profile of Caf√© Bustelo: A Deep Dive into the Experience
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Caf√© Bustelo is not just coffee; it‚Äôs an experience steeped in rich, cultural heritage. From its bold taste to its inviting aroma, every sip of Caf√© Bustelo transports you to a world of deep flavors and vibrant energy. If you‚Äôre a coffee lover seeking to elevate your daily brew, there‚Äôs much to unpack regarding what makes this brand so special.

One of the standout features of Caf√© Bustelo is its espresso-style blend. This coffee is known for its robust flavor profile, making it an ideal choice for those who appreciate a strong cup. The unique roasting process used by Caf√© Bustelo delivers an intense aroma that captures the essence of traditional Latin American coffee. You might find yourself enchanted by its deep, earthy notes combined with a subtle sweetness that perfectly balances out the bitterness of more traditional coffee.

The coffee beans are carefully selected, typically featuring a blend of Arabica and Robusta types. Here's what you can expect from each variant:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-caf√©-bustelo  
  
- **Arabica:** Offers a smoother flavor and nuanced complexity, contributing to the drink's richness.
- **Robusta:** Adds a hearty body and a stronger, more robust flavor, which is essential for that authentic Caf√© Bustelo experience.

When brewing Caf√© Bustelo, the method you choose can significantly alter the taste. Popular methods include using a Moka pot, which is central to Latin American coffee culture, or simply brewing it in a drip coffee maker. Using a Moka pot allows you to extract the rich, robust flavors fully, resulting in a concentrated shot of coffee that pairs perfectly with steamed milk for a caf√© con leche.

The versatility of Caf√© Bustelo is another reason it stands out. Whether you enjoy it black, with milk, or mixed into a creamy latte, each preparation reveals different layers of the coffee's flavor. Many fans love creating coffee cocktails or iced variations, where the rich notes really shine through. This adaptability makes it a favorite among both casual drinkers and coffee aficionados.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-caf√©-bustelo  
  
Another impressive aspect of Caf√© Bustelo is its smooth finish. Unlike some coffees that may leave a lingering bitterness, a well-brewed cup of Caf√© Bustelo boasts a clean aftertaste.

### Choosing Your Ingredients

The first step in brewing the perfect cup of Caf√© Bustelo is selecting high-quality ingredients. Here‚Äôs what you need:

- **Caf√© Bustelo Coffee:** Start with fresh Caf√© Bustelo coffee ground to your preference.
- **Water:** Use filtered water for the best flavor. Tap water can alter the taste significantly.
- **Additives:** Decide if you want milk, sugar, or any flavored syrups to enhance your drink.

### Selecting Your Brewing Method

How you brew your coffee greatly affects its taste. Here are some popular brewing methods suitable for Caf√© Bustelo:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-caf√©-bustelo  
  
- **Drip Coffee Maker:** This classic method is convenient and provides a consistent cup. Remember to use the right coffee-to-water ratio, about 1-2 tablespoons of coffee for every six ounces of water.
- **French Press:** This technique brings out the rich flavors. Let the coffee steep for about four minutes before pressing the plunger.
- **Espresso Machine:** For a stronger taste, an espresso machine can deliver a robust cup. Use approximately 14-18 grams of coffee for a double shot.

### Grinding Your Coffee

Freshness is key when it comes to taste. If you can, grind your coffee just before brewing. Here‚Äôs how different grind sizes affect your coffee:

- **Coarse Grind:** Best suited for a French press or cold brew.
- **Medium Grind:** Ideal for drip coffee makers.
- **Fine Grind:** Perfect for espresso machines.

### Water Temperature Matters

The temperature of your water can impact flavor. Aim for a temperature between 195¬∞F and 205¬∞F. This range allows for optimal extraction of the coffee‚Äôs oils and flavors without scalding the beans. If you don‚Äôt have a thermometer, simply bring your water to a boil and let it sit for about 30 seconds before using.

- An espresso shot requires around 0.5-1 ounces of ground coffee.
- For a French Press, a ratio of 1:15 (1 part coffee to 15 parts water) is a good rule of thumb.

### Brewing Time is Crucial

The brewing time depends on your method:

- **Drip Maker:** About 5 minutes.
- **French Press:** About 4 minutes, followed by a gentle press.
- **Espresso:** Around 25-30 seconds for a perfect shot.

### Serving Your Coffee

Your coffee is ready, but how you serve it can enhance the experience. Here are some serving ideas:

I'll give a rundown real quick. We are the same age she plays volleyball at a college near by and I first saw her at a coffee shop staring at me and glanced over while talking to my friends then looked over to see her looking at me and then it happened again while we were on our way out as well. Second time was the next day I decided to go to the game and after the game went to get food real quick with some buddies and was heading back to my car when she walked around the corner and we ran into each other so I decided to start a convo and it went really well and she and I just exchanged basic stuff about each other and she hoped to see me at the next game. Next game I go to I obviously see her and we are looking at each other throughout the game (this is a championship game) her coach calls timeout and during the huddle she turns around and waves and her teammates and coach look at me then look at her and then she got pulled to the side and got benched lol. Then following week is another tournament same thing happens again we look at each other and she smiles and does a disrete wave and smiles and her coached didn't see this time but her teammates did lol.
