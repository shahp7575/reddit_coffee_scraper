The boys were hard work for the first couple years but much better now that they’re going to daycare and sleeping through the night. Our baby on the other hand has been a delight. She eats and sleeps well and overall has a good disposition.

Raising three kids has been tough and our relationship is definitely not what it was like pre kids. This is to be expected with the responsibilities and lifestyle changes of parenthood. But nowadays even getting a cuddle on the couch or god forbid holding hands while driving (never mind sex) seems almost repulsive to her. It’s as if she couldn’t think of anything worse. She says it’s because she’s been touched too much by kids all day and stressed but I mean, the twins are in day care 5 days a week, she’s on mat leave for a year, the baby sleeps sounds 3 times a day and we both agree, she is a very chill baby. When I work from home she’s mostly just watching reality TV all day and doing the odd chore. I know it’s not easy all the time but it’s not like she’s crushed with stress. We got a cleaner, she goes to cross fit a few times a week and is out for coffees with her pals afterwards. I would love to switch positions.

On the other hand, I work a pretty demanding job but not crazy hours but it’s constantly in the background. She feels sometimes I don’t pull my weight with kids and housework and why she supposedly doesn’t feel affectionate.But it sounds like I do a lot more than all the other dads know and notably her friends dads. I also pay for everything and handle a lot of household admin she has no interest in. Sure maybe I’m not great at laundry or washing bottles but I feel it’s unfair looking for me to pull equal housework and childcare when I got a demanding day job that we all depend on. It’s also a new job with a promotion so it’s been more demanding than usual.

Anyhow, not looking to be congratulated just to be recognised but also to feel like a husband again and not a housemate that pays the bills, babysits and fixes things around the house.

What do I do fellow dads?

Drunk Confessions, One Wild Night, and a Baby Bombshell: ""The Hot Cop Who Loved Me"" Just Served Up the Steamiest Age-Gap Glow-Up I've Read This Year – Buckle Up, Y'all!

Thirty-five, freshly divorced, and *done* with playing it safe? Enter Whitney Trumbolt, spilling her wildest fantasies to the one guy she *shouldn't* – her younger brother's smoking-hot cop bestie, Ryan ""Renegade"" Kepler. He's 25, built like a Southern thunderstorm, and harboring a decade-long crush that's about to explode into one reckless, red-hot night of hair-pulling, ass-smacking, nipple-licking bliss (her words, not mine). But when morning-after regrets collide with a surprise pregnancy test (five positives, because why not go big?), ""off-limits"" turns into ""oh shit, this might actually work."" Throw in a protective big bro ready to throw hands, Ryan's high-stakes job busting moonshiners, and Whitney's battle to believe she's worthy of a second shot at love – it's messy, it's sexy, and it's got that ""I didn't see *that* coming"" magic that keeps you up till dawn.

I dove into the first two chapters last night (current date vibes: updated *today*, Dec 20 – holiday reading just leveled up), and *whew* – Chapter 1's bar confession had me cackling and fanning myself, while Chapter 2's chase-into-the-house tension? Pure foreplay on the page. Whitney's unfiltered drunk-rant to Ryan is gold: ""I need my hair pulled, a red handprint across my ass, someone licking my nipples, a dick in my treasure cove."" (Treasure cove? Iconic.) And Ryan? That shift from lovesick teen to confident cop whispering ""I know I'm the one who can put my dick in that treasure cove"" – *dead*. The push-pull of her insecurities vs. his ""you're gorgeous"" growl? Chef's kiss.

433 chapters deep (yep, you can binge like it's your job), 4.8 stars blazing, and tags like Age Gap, Forbidden Love, One-Night Stand, and Marriage that scream slow-burn steam with heart. If *The Cop and the Girl from the Coffee Shop* by Piper Rayne or *Protect* by Harper A. Brooks got you hooked on blue-collar heroes with badges (and abs), this Southern-fried cop romance will have you swooning harder than a debutante at a tailgate.",1,1766239185.0,RomanceNovelHub,0,1.0,False

I’m honestly the quiet one and I don’t talk much in a group setting and I’m not particularly close to anyone in the group. I never initiate plans but I thought I would this time since I never do. The girls occasionally ask the group to hang out to which I reply I can, and when I go they never seem to dislike me or anything. I was a bridesmaid at one of their weddings, we went in group trips together as a group and then one of them invited me to a smaller trip with the 3 of us.

I’m not close to them but not so distant either. I see them as surface level friends and I thought they see me that way too and I was fine with it because I like doing activities with them. I asked if anyone is free this Saturday to grab a coffee and no one responded. I sent this on Tuesday and still nobody replied. Not even to say no, no they’re busy, no they can’t make it but maybe next weekend, etc. I was flat out ghosted.

Maybe I initiated too late? Maybe it’s because I’m just there on the edges/surface and I don’t talk to anybody. I thought this would be a good opportunity to have a more personal hang out but nobody even replied. Someone else asked to grab coffee/bruch to whoever was free 2 weeks ago and people replied saying they weren’t free, but at least they got a response. Nobody replied to me at all.

I mean I know I’m not close to anyone but I deserve acknowledgment :/ We are all in our late 20s early 30s. 2 of them liked my IG post and TikTok a couple days after I sent the message

1preyor,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1preyor/how_many_euphorias_are_there/,How many Euphorias are there,"As the trans community, we read a lot about dysphorias here (actually I think the most common type is am I trans posts, to which I stopped commenting, because 99% of the time my reply is yes, you are) So in the holiday season and weekend spirit, I would like you to explore with me, how many euphorias are there from pre-everything to post-op. 

Ofc with stupid names for all of them should be there.

I go first:

Owphoria: breasts hit on a door or doorframe, one of the most celebrated euphorias.

Boy or male failing: failing to pass as a boy/man even in neutral clothing and even in short hair.

Unlockphoria: face id on your phone failing to unlock.

Callphoria: being addressed as female over a phone or from beyond a door. (For some reason I get it a lot, pre-hrt and on hrt)

Weakphoria: Failing to open a door or lift something, an action you could do before hrt, but now more difficult due to muscle loss.ç

Balancephoria: loss of balance, tripping or general clumsiness due to change in balance center of the body.

Gentphoria: a stranger holding door for you, pulling your chair so you can sit, opening your taxi door, all the ladies first bs. (I love it)

Petphoria: a dog or a cat seeing your gender, due to fundamental change in scent, especially around genitals.

Babephoria: a baby or a toddler seeing your gender, as they have less gender related brain coding. (My daughter calls me mom a lot. Although we insist I am her father)

Aiphoria: An ai seeing your gender, as the code follows gender markers, and don’t generally do feminine gatekeeping. Example: whatsapp avatar function asking you to send a selfie

Legalphoria: acceptance of your gender by a state

Mediphoria: a medical professional failing to clock you. More points if they are a gynocologist.

Padphoria: a cis woman asking if you have a pad or a tampon. Equally a cis woman getting naked next to you can be counted.

I want to conclude my thought experiment with two euphorias I received recently, that are hard to categorize.

One is being recognized as trans. Long before passing is even on the menu, I went to a lingerie store. The store woman came and said if I want, there is a cabin in the back and I can try on the bras. Simple, affirming, beautiful. I was nowhere near passing, and not on hrt, but she knew I would not get mad at a question like that and she knew I was shopping for myself. Bravo.

Maybe another sort of early transition euphoria is someone NOT GENDERING you. Back then I was living in a French speaking country and gendering was everything. Because if you are speaking FR, they call you a monsieur 50 times before you can buy a loaf of bread. And whenever they just refrained from it, was a small victory for me.

Second happened recently. I work with my mom and dad and I am undercover hrt. A huge wave of crying came and I ran outside the office. I went to a cafe right around the corner. And in that cafe I bought a coffee and sat in the terrace with my back to the terrace and started sobbing there quietly. I was looking up stuff about dysphoria and crying was estrogen fueled but mostly about passing. And then a guy came from behind and said “ma’am do you want to buy a lottery ticket?”

Some ally friends when I told them this story there were mad I didn’t buy a ticket. But why should I? I won already. Be safe.

Day 4 only here but this is my magic formula after trying out those suggestions from AI tools and some good videos.

2.	⁠⁠⁠Drink 12Oz of water
3.	⁠⁠⁠Movement(10 pushups and 10 sit-ups)
4.	⁠⁠⁠First coffee only 60-75 mins later( 7:00 ish)
5.	⁠⁠⁠If hungry, oats and nuts along with it.
6.	⁠⁠⁠Last caffeine hit before 10AM for the day.
7.	⁠⁠⁠Bed by 9:30ish
8.	⁠⁠⁠Not hitting snooze but actually waking up same time the following morning and turning the lights on.

Very alert through then day after the coffee and through the day afternoon. •	⁠body naturally preparing itself to knock off by 9:30 PM •	⁠much better sleep.

I am(hopefully I can say “was” in the future) an avid coffee drinker and I now only realize that the avidness is in response to having more coffee through out the day. That was I think the secret killer.

Any other tips appreciated but I would love to know what folks think about this routine to build a better self.

1prexb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/1prexb0/creating_actual_capacity_for_perception_of_more/,Creating actual capacity for perception of more energy,"Andrew Huberman interviewed Martin Picard. It's a long one, but very interesting. At about the 1hr 30 minute mark they get into the idea of inflammaging. This really helped me integrate something that I have been wondering about for a long time.

  
Things such as coffee, amphetamines, other stimulants may help the brain perceive that it has more energy capacity but really you are borrowing from the future.

  
The real way to build true system capacity seems to be not only in building more mitochondria through exercise and effort, but also managing the inflammatory cytokine signals being sent to the brain that basically tell the brain that the body is going energectically bankrupt.

  
To build true, deeper capacity you have to clear out the senescent cells that are using a lot of energy. These senescent cells not only rob you of energy but keep sending inflammatory cytokine signals to the brain. Thus, the need for rest, deep sleep, intermittment fasting, fasting, etc.



**CHatGpt transcribed their dialogue below but did not label who is speaking, so it's all just one rambling thing....**

*""We've developed a model called the energy conservation model, the brain-body energy conservation model of aging, the BEC model. And so you could dive into this, but I think there's significant changes that happen in some cells. As cells age, they start to actually burn energy faster. When cells become senescent, they burn energy faster, and then they're sending signals. I'm struggling, energetically speaking, and that's what I think inflammaging is. You have some cells, not all cells, some cells in the body, they're kind of over the edge, they're becoming senescent, and then they send signals, and those signals are the same signal that we release during sickness behavior. If your immune system is like really struggling energetically because it's trying to fight off a virus, it's gonna send those same cytokines. And when those cytokines reach the brain, the brain says, oh sh-t, we're gonna go bankrupt. You know, the energy budget is threatened here. So let's save energy. And then you become apathetic, you become cold, you shrink your muscles, and those are all good energy-saving, energy conservation strategies to a viral infection, right? The same thing seems to happen slowly as you age, if you have those cells that are sending those signals. But if you exercise, and if you don't eat too much, and once in a while you feel hungry, maybe in terms of fasting, or you actually now can get rid of those signals of like energetic stress, and you can make the organism more efficient. I think a significant benefit to exercise is improving efficiency. And then you can fight off inflammation. Really what this is, is you're bringing the organism's energy resistance, the cells that are struggling, you're kind of normalizing them, and then you don't feel like you're running out of energy. So I think it's a perception problem. So I'm now going to imagine that one of the reasons why we have less energy, in quotes- We feel less energy. We feel less energy, thank you, as we age is because of inflammation in the body, calling more energy to be allocated to those cells that are in the inflamed area, and they're consuming more energy. So by reducing inflammation, you have more energy to allocate to other things. Correct. Got it. And so this is very different than how we were talking about at the beginning, when I said, you know, my advisor came up to me, why do we have less energy? I just imagined it was rundown of mitochondria. So this is what creates a kind of dynamic tension, and that's very practical for me and for everybody. For instance, I could run more to increase the number of mitochondria in my body. I can sleep a little bit more to offset the inflammation from the running, but ultimately I'm playing a game. I have to budget. Am I gonna exercise more to get more mitochondria? So my brain and body have more energy, but I'm also gonna create some inflammation when I exercise, and that's going to eat up a bunch of energy too. So it's just like time or money or anything else. You can't do everything. So, you know, my mindset has always been, and I think I'm gonna stick with this, frankly, lift weights three days a week, do cardio three days a week, rest completely one day a week, do the other things like sauna and cold as you see appropriate, but make darn sure you're getting six to eight hours of sleep each night. I've been pretty religious about that for a long time, and try to not burn energy on drama or mind-numbing things, and certainly don't use any substances that use up a lot of energy excessively. I do drink a lot of caffeine, but, you know, like prescription stimulants that I know people rely on a lot, like, I'll just call it out, modafinil. I've taken it once when sleep deprived. You feel as if you slept eight hours, but you're borrowing that energy from someplace. And it's not just the crash that happens later, it's the long-term effects of this. And I think this is why people who use amphetamines and cocaine and things like that, stimulants, we often find that, sure, they die of heart failure. That's very common, actually, in people who use cocaine earlier. We're gonna talk about this, but let's just be direct about it. They're borrowing energy from the future, is what you're doing. And so I think, I'm a big fan of people exercising more, eating better, et cetera, but at some point, you're increasing inflammation that way as well. Inflammation is a reframe that to me completely changed my perspective on what inflammation is. Inflammation is an energetic signal. If there are cytokines in your blood, it means somewhere in your body, and that's not true of all cytokines, but the major cytokines that we think about, like IL-6, interleukin-6, it's secreted by muscles, not during the exercise. Like you're doing your run, right? I could say you run intensely for an hour or two hours. IL-6 has an increase. It's when you stop exercising, boom, you get this beautiful spike of IL-6. And then you ask, what is that? So IL-6 is a cytokine, right? It's a cellular signaling system. And then IL-6 goes to your fat, and then it says, we need energy. Like lipolysis, chop out those lipids that's stored in your fat, release that in the blood, because the liver needs it to make glucose. And then the IL-6 goes to the liver as well, and then tells the liver, make glucose, because the muscle is depleted, right? And the IL-6 burst after exercise is particularly strong if your glycogen depleted, right? If the muscle is out of its internal- Like after resistance training or sprinting or high intensity training. High intensity, yes. So then the IL-6 then is a signal, right? To mobilize energy. It's the muscle's way of telling the rest of the body, I'm running low on energy, right? Please help. And then it recruits the fat, it recruits the liver, and then it sends signal to the brain. The brain has IL-6 receptors as well. And it says, you know, feel like crap. Like you need to recover. Lose your vitality, your vigor, at least for a little bit, and rest. And like Arnold said, you become stronger, you make your mitochondria, more mitochondria, and you become fitter, not during the exercise, it's during the rest period.""*",1,1766238995.0,PeterAttia,0,1.0,False

I have like a weird taste on the tip of my tongue. I have ear pressure and blockage. My stomach gurgles all the time it started after doing some diaphragmatic breathing excessively. My stomach hurts and burns under my left rib when its empty. But when i had alkali water my stomach hurt so bad. I am on omperazole and have been sleeping elevated. Not eating too close to bedtime. But i keep waking up from the burning and i drink either almond milk or have a banana. This started after i was stressed so i thought its my anxiety i tried an SSRI my insomnia was horrible. I dont know if it was a placebo or because i was less stresses but i took antibiotics for a week and the symptoms went away. I tested negative for h pylori but i am going to get tested again as i took a PPI before it. My question is why is it that despite changes being made to my diet. Nothing is changing is it my nervous system but why did the SSRI not calm me down. Is it because i had chocolate for two days after months of not having it. Is it because i did ab exercises and this weakened my LES. I have also been burping but now the burps dont come up and they stat stuck in my throat. The gurgles have also increased. Its the waking up at night to eat and not getting enough sleep. I am trying melatonin but i keep waking up from the burning under my left rib. I am taking gaviscon advance but it still burns. I am lost, anything i eat triggers it. I also keep going on reddit and reading peoples stories make me feel sad. I dont drink or smoke, i always hated coffee and i am quite paranoid about my health so i stopped processed food for six months before this happened.  I am underweight and i was quite active but after this its like all my motivation is gone. I worry the acid is going to make me deaf because my ear keeps clicking. I know my symptoms arent severe i just keep thinking what if it gets worse, even though my endoscopy was clear reading that the stomach gurgles might be a hernia is stressing me out.

One day she put a story from a café. Two coffees on the table. I ignored it.
Later, a friend sent me screenshots of her chats with another guy. Nothing sexual. Just late-night talks. Stuff like “I feel comfortable with you” and “I can talk to you about anything.” Things she used to say to me.

That honestly hurt more than if she had just admitted she liked him.

\- I don’t have a girlfriend. I am dating someone who I just met on an app.

\- she is 38, she has two children. She is married but going through the legal process of ending the marriage. Her husband doesn’t live with her.

\- after work drinks, we get really close. We spend the whole night together. flirt, touch, kiss which leads to us having sex.

\- I check up on her. We chat. ( I know this is an error. I should not have asked what we are. this is against the teaching for coach Corey)

\- I ask her what are we. She says we are friends and she never wants to lose me. Her life is complicated and she can’t rush into a relationship and risk losing me.

\- she says let’s keep it as friends but casual and see where it goes.

**Back at work**

\- we seem closer than before

\- I notice her looking at me more

\- when sitting next her her our legs touch. she brushes up against me. Our hands touch.

\- when we walk past each other. our hands touch.

\- she has a Saturday with no kids And no plans. I ask her out but she says she can’t. She got a lot of stuff to sort before Xmas. She has no money and doesn’t expect me to pay for everything. then she says maybe after Xmas we can do something.

i think this isn’t a good sign? if I liked someone even an hour walk and coffee we could have done? but maybe I guess we are past this stage?

**Searching for**: Im open for all kinds of installations; regular network meetings, brainstorming sessions, hackathons, even establishing a hackerhouse or sharing some office facilities - or just grabbing a coffee and bouncing ideas around??

I currently don't have a specific startup/product idea im working on, so im open for exploring (maybe even non-tech stuff).

1preoe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1preoe1/a_totally_euphoric_story_trans/,A Totally Euphoric Story (Trans),"Heya, thank you for reading this! Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1preleo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1preleo/im_trapped_please_forgive_what_ive_done/,"Im trapped, please forgive what i've done.","If I was pinched from the mortal plane, only to find myself forced to state my case before the faceless creator, I think I know what I'd say. “I'm not proud of the selfish choices I've made in the midst of all which I cannot explain.” Then I would immediately be cast into the depths of hell for lying in the face of God.

 But I made my choices for a reason, and I would never do anything different. Otherwise everything that happened here was pointless. They were all weak, unable to do what was required for their own survival. Because of their insubordination to the circumstances, employees have quickly turned from peers to bait.

 But I recognize what needs to be done, and I would rather leap head first into an inky unknown, than have to be near the specimen one more time. The creature now plagues my mind, displacing ignorance. I want to forget its existence, and the horrific stench that follows its hunt through the corridors. I dread the sickening squelch of each labored step in its stride.

 But I chose to follow the choreography of this path in life. Always in the back of my mind, I knew my final dance would leave me bleeding over the stands.

It was a simple task, gather data on this newly discovered species. For the benefit of humanity they said, but when have I ever cared about humanity? My allegiance to the facility is concrete for other reasons. Ones built off years of my lifespan, and gratitude for taking me off the streets all those decades ago.

My peers race their invisible tracks around the office, taking pit stops at every shining lab surface. They refuel their tanks looking through microscopes, opening and slamming hatches to spinning boxes filled with colorful vials. Then they rev their engines by scribbling numbers and charts into their notepads, before taking off to loop the track just one more time.

I won't claim that we were all comfortable with this routine, we definitely weren't content. Peeling your head up from a new glossy surface every morning weighs on your body after a time. But the dozens of free coffee dispensers, paid for and supplied by the company, kept our manic minds working late into the night with steam.

When the alarms rang, it was clear to be nothing more than a drill. We have a dozen randomly scheduled throughout the month. A heavy sigh rolled down my chest onto my workspace, I rose with my coworkers and robotically made my way to the nearest exit.

We were the second closest station to our exit, which meant that we should be the second group to reach it. But as we came up on the doors, there were no researchers in sight. Even the usually ever present armed guards were missing from their stations. The horrible sign made me uneasy, someone was always supposed to be standing by the door.

“We must have been walking faster than the first team” a blue coat muttered to himself. He said it like he needed to hear it. But for some reason, his words just left a bad taste in my mouth. I shook off the growing weight of my worry. Instead, I focused on keeping a steady pace between each of my breaths.

As senior researcher I stepped forward. Rhythmically pressing my password into the black terminal, I was met with a song different from the typical latching mechanical guts. Different from  the familiar screech of grinding gears, which normally sung neath the surface of the 10 inch steel door. Instead the terminal rang out with two quick pings. 

Meeting my coworkers' glossy eyes to confirm the daunting sound, my worst fear was solidified in our hearts. All at once the world began to fall apart.

 I couldn't keep myself upright for the life of me as I shifted to lean against the smooth wall. The gripping chill of the metal only amplified the freezing electricity coursing up my arms and through my weak legs.

 In no more than a mere moment, multiple dozen grown men and women, previously calm and orderly, were largely reduced to shaking banshees. As more research groups caught up, they pushed their way through the quickly forming crowd, intent on proving their demise themselves. 

But their expended effort was useless. Because the terminal didn't care who wanted to exit the facility anymore, from this point on their only concern is keeping things *in*. Another researcher tried inputting her code, and once again the terminal's song rang aloud, striking sharp, bloodied lines across our lives.

I had an idea of what my next step was. As one of the select few assigned higher privileges with the specimen, I of course had plenty of time to ponder what I'd do if things went to shit. This outcome was only inevitable, so why was I now stumbling within my mind?

 “Pull yourselves together” I mumbled to myself. This behavior shining from my peers, it made my stomach sink. They're disgracing everything we've done here. I need to rise above if I want my final hours to last. My eyes fixed onto the crowd, my next obstacle.

Anxiety was growing, peeling away my layers until my weak, soft insides were exposed. Predators likely now roam these halls, and I required the entirety of my waning strength to swim through the dense crowd. If I wanted even a chance to survive, I had to distance myself from these dinner bells.

A deafening screech sounded aloud the speakers, and for a split second everyone, including myself, fell silent in thick anticipation. People who had previously been sitting on the floor crying, and those who had been screaming and sprinting.

 They all froze. Whether from a mix of hope and fear, maybe just pure curiosity. It didn't matter, they were intensively soaking in every word. 

“Biometric sensors tripped in the West wing. Thank you, for all you've done.” A smile crept across my face, they just fucking threw us to the winds. Not like I'd have done anything different in their position. 

I lunged into the dense mass of bodies, intent on seeing through the forest of white and occasionally black or blue coats. A multicolor gathering of screaming meat, sustenance for the beast.

 Being larger in stature compared to the bulk of my peers, I had an easier time shoving people to the ground than I expected. It was disheartening the way they’d fall, as if they were nothing more than posterboard, giving way to my every parting swipe. Before I knew it, I was peering from behind lanky figures at the opposed open side of the crowd. 

I remember racing through the hallway's many winding junctions. When a man equal to my size, sporting a black coat and shirt, turned the corner near the end of my journey. Obviously unaware of the situation, he was in the middle of a mad dash toward the door. I'm sorry.

It was set in stone, an act of depravity against life. A ritual for the doorway, one that needed a subject. Here lies my greatest opportunity, flesh in the guise of an unfortunate stranger. He hasn't fought for his life yet, and like most I assume he never will. Weak and selfish, In this violent world he will never earn his place.

Influencing others is a tricky task, yet as always I'll be sure to adapt. Maybe I can take advantage of his empathy. Yes, that's the narrative I need. Someone is hurt, and I can't help them alone. I'll need to pounce suddenly, like a calculated predator wading in the tall grass.

I waved my hand making sure to maintain eye contact. “Someone collapsed at the door! I need your help carrying them through!” I yelled, taking off my white coat. “Help me carry her through the exit, quickly!”

No other words were exchanged, the burly man simply slowed, met my eyes, and nodded with a sense of duty peeking from behind his dim, pearly eyes. 

He resumed his sprint, and I followed just behind. Looking at the back of the man's head, I didn't know if I was ready for what needed to be done. He's certainly built larger than any of the lab geeks. In the end it's his survival or mine.

Twisting my coat into one thick string of cloth, I threw the fabric over his neck and used all my weight to force him to the ground in one desperate burst of energy. I managed to catch him off guard just as I had hoped. The prey was in my talons.

The large man desperately began fighting his way off the ground. Just a little longer, that ticket implanted in his arm would make everything easier. I threw my heel against the back of his neck. Pushing with my foot, I clenched the rope around his heads stump as tight as I could muster. My nerves are carving deep, even a single stumble or hesitation here and it's over.

I closed my eyes, alternating from holding my own breath to bouts of hyperventilation. In the void of my mind I heard him drowning on tile, just keep thinking about that ticket. Every attempt to shift his weight and gain control came with pained grunts and groans.

And when my eyes finally opened, the man was slumped against the floor. No longer a man, just a pile of scraps. I grabbed him by the shoulders and propped his torso against the wall. His eyes no longer showed signs of struggle. 

As I stared into the glossy orbs, I kept expecting some kind of twitch in his dripping gaze. But his journey was over, he now existed only as a vessel to aid in my own. Those eyes were consuming, tearing my psyche apart.

In the commotion I found myself unaware of where exactly I was. Signs littered the tops of arches and rounded corners. Even in all my years working for this godforsaken company, I still often struggled to get my bearings.

 My eyes latched onto the leftmost sign. Bright red borders snugly wrapped its font, “East sector Containment”

Not at all what I'm looking for here. but the sign left me thinking something that made my nerves flare. What other creatures are kept here that I don't know about? What might cross react and cause the formation of another world eater.

 I peered to another sign, its plain welcoming font read “Computer labs.” Still not what I needed. The next read “Restrooms.” Not yet.

Adjacent on the opposite side of the hall, sat a plain black and white sign. Aloud I read, “East Cafeteria.” I would need tools from the kitchen, so I made a final note of where my ticket lie, and down the hall I set off.

The halls were mostly quiet aside from my shoes making contact with the solid tile. The alarms still shone a piercing red, but they had finally shut up their incessant nag. I was now nearing the cafeteria, something about the air left me growing increasingly on edge.

Empty tables filled the interior like a desert. I scanned around failing to recognize any immediate signs of life. Except across a couple tables, they were covered in puddles. Some kind of bright red residue, I don't think it's blood. 

Peering into the line I saw empty holes in place of the tin food warmers, where previously there had sat a variety of proteins and breads. It was now just an empty, consuming, and dark cavity.

I hopped the counter gaining access to the kitchen. Sitting in the far corner I saw my toolbox, the chopping block. The medium for my ritual, the vessel of auger. As I pulled on the end of a blade, It gave way with a small screech of sliding metal. 

Just as the tool was freed, the maintenance door adjacent to me slammed open. Jumping heavily I threw up my defense. But in no time at all, a crimson sphere no larger than a basketball rolled with devastating force into my leg. The impact of which sent me tumbling to the ground. 

The Sphere circled around me, audibly feeling its surroundings with small red tendrils. My hair was standing on end. It just rolled away, climbing back over the counter into the cafeteria. I need to get the hell out of there.

That wasn't just any stray anomaly, it was a scout. A shedding from our main specimen. Cast into the winding halls, it was likely returning to the main body to report my location. Meaning the creature would be on its way.

I pulled myself up the moment I made the realization. Blade in hand, I hopped the counter into the eating area. Suddenly I was looking up from the floor, a dull pain in my side. With a groan I raised my wet palm, it was covered in a red residue left behind by the scout.

My stomach turned slightly as I hopped up to my feet once more. Now that I had the tools, It was time to head back to my opportunity. The path was much more tense on the second trek. Now that I had evidence it began shedding, I had to keep my neck a swivel, if I wanted to keep it at all. 

Turning the corner I saw him. He looked peaceful, someone even threw their coat over his head. “What a waste,” I muttered as I leaned close. I picked up the fabric and tied it over my shoulder. When his eyes were uncovered, a wave of sorrow began creeping from my chest.

I wondered what his name was, who his friends were. I wondered if I could have just talked to him. I even asked myself what toys he played with as a boy. The glistening badge clipped to his breast pocket would give me one of those answers.

“Security Division, Travis Blahnik”. I made a mistake when my eyes met that badge. It only served to make what had to happen next more difficult. Lifting up his forearm, I used the blade to dig into his skin. Inside the prodding metal swayed left and right.

This was not without purpose, with enough poking around a glint of crimson silver shone from inside his wound. More careful now, I used the tip of the knife to pry the silver capsule from his cold skin. Pinched between my fingertips, the silver pill had been no larger than a tic tac.

They chipped us like dogs. I still remember when I could trace the small mark on my arm, but in time the scar has faded to obscurity. Only something was special about this particular chip. 

Security Division, such beautiful words were full of meaning, depending on your perception. It could mean being an unruly ass with a hero complex, or that you just enjoy dressing yourself in black every morning. But to me? Those words *screamed* “Access to the Armory”

There was just one last thing I had to do.

Our facility houses.. Interesting security. Without a chip, the keypads won't work for you. And certain chips when in proximity to each other, will shut down some terminals entirely. With this chip I was effectively Travis Blahnik. Like always I must adopt more faces, I'm going to earn my survival.

The ritual hasn't been fulfilled, I still have to pay my price. Currently the pill in my hand is on equal grounds with a roasted seed. Useless while I still had my research chip. The armory hatch wouldn't want a researcher to slip by after Travis put in his code.

 That brings me to the next step. I need to find some form of antiseptic. I don't need some horrible infection while I'm stuck here.

Hand soap could work nicely if I felt I could stomach flooding the wound with scented syrup. And there's always the ethanol we keep in chemical storage, although that would take longer to heal, and I don't feel like trying to keep a clean wound while I run my errands. My best bet would be soap water, or to make my own saline. 

To make the saline, I would need somewhere I can boil water. Somewhere like a stovetop, the kind in the kitchen that was now off limits. I'm torn between the easy option, a quick trip to the restroom. And the safer, high effort option. Skipping my happy ass back to the kitchen, despite the current risks.

How could I be sure I even still remembered the armory passcode?

 Many years ago, my beginnings in this facility were far simpler than my position as senior researcher. I believe I was two years out of college, sneaking into lectures paper in hand, with my small black laptop. I sat down as the speaker rambled about cell biology.

The professor motioned to the side, waving up a guest presentation. The man wore all black, and on his side was clipped a taser with pepper spray. He had my attention as he introduced himself.

“Good evening everyone. My name is Scott Petrov, and today I represent the Acidic corporation."" He carried himself well, his authoritative tone of speech lent him complete control of my attention.

He continued, “First I would like to thank the university for bringing me here on stage. If you are a student of this class, chances are that you're taking up a research-heavy career.” He paused for a moment as if waiting for someone to answer, before quickly continuing his rehearsed lines.

“I'm here today to present an opportunity. We at the Acidic corp have developed a program for eager students who want first hand experience in our advanced facility.” He continued, “instead of grabbing coffee each morning for your superiors, running senseless errands. Wouldn't you rather have a larger sense of responsibility?” 

My ears perked higher than they already were. 

“As a Security volunteer, your presence is guaranteed to make everyone in a room feel safe. You will manage rollcalls, track down and contain lost data, and more. All the while being on a fast track to becoming one of our esteemed scientists.”

A slight chill composed of a partial laugh crept up my spine, It all sounded too good to be true. I noticed he was still talking, “If you have any questions about the program, how to apply, and our minimal prerequisites. I urge you to talk with me after this lecture.”

The man then thanked the professor for his time, before giving up the stage for the rest of our period. I don't remember what we were learning, I was too busy running through my mind. Branching theoretical opportunities with my unrealistic dreams.

I was so engrossed that I almost didn't notice when the lecture was over. I swiped a glance across the room and landed on the leaning figure. He almost blended into the shadows with his pitch black shirt and jeans. But his pale eyes easily met mine though the dim light.

I rose from my seat anxiously, I had questions that required answers. As I came close the figure steadied his posture. He stretched out his arm and passed me a cold sheet of paper. Its presence in my hands felt consuming.

 Sitting neatly in the corner along a dotted line, was a phone number. I decided I would try it.

The phone call that would follow marked the beginning of my intricate relationship with the facility. I almost didn't have time to think with how quickly they swept me off the streets and into an orientation chamber. 

I spent my days patrolling the south wings first, second, and third floors. Occasionally they'd send me throughout the complex, pesticides in hand. I'd have to spray various molds made up of an assortment of neon colors. It looked like someone drew on the walls with crayon.

But with one quick spurt from the yellow canister, the mold peeled off the wall dead, its pieces settling into an odorous grey pile of mush. Mushrooms of all colors and sizes also grew from drains in the showers. The scientists loved sending me out to harvest samples. Never once did I get a thanks for that disgusting chore. 

I rarely ventured outside the facility, It's not like I had anywhere to go. This place kept me warm, fed me two meals a day, and it kept me out of the rain. It's safe to say this place was now my home. The thick walls tube fed me a sense of security, confined yet I had never been safer.

In between errands I couldn't help but write about the substances I'd come in contact with. Their colors and strange properties consumed my mind, as I narrowly avoided lab geeks' shoulders in the hall.

Because of my “perfect attendance” as our director put it, paired with the fact that they found my notebooks in the vent. I was summoned over the intercom to the directors office. As my fugue state doodles slammed on the desk, I knew that I'd been caught. 

The director peered at my scribbles, then at me. Her eyes scratched off each letter from the topmost page. She spoke, “let me just say, I cannot believe what I've read here so far. I mean I've skimmed your notes over and over.”

I was tense, ready to receive my termination notice.

The Director continued, “ I'd like to personally offer you a more.. Fitting position here at the facility.” Immediately I spiraled back out of my mind, ""You're offering *me* a promotion?” I sheepishly jumbled out.

She replied with a smile, “just a junior research position, nothing major. Something tells me you have a bright future with us. You only need to sign, but please be mindful of the terms.”

Of course I leapt at the opportunity. I had no idea just how deep the rabbit hole went in this shiny hell. And thus my research career started with a hitch. I've been with the Acidic corp for many years now, two and a half decades to be exact. Partly because I love what I do just as much as it disgusts me. And partly because I don't have a choice anymore.

In case it wasn't obvious, someone as deeply entangled in this facility's workings doesn't just get to walk into the sunset. When I retire, my contract states that I am to throw myself into the on site furnace. That is the only escape I am allowed.

The devil beckoned me from across the table, and when she handed me this contract from hell, I signed in red. Now I too danced with these demons. Its like fucking Nazi Germany in here.

Over the years I've conducted many of my own experiments, we've tested the effects of countless molds, and growths, on pregnant women. We have addicted men women and children alike to an endless array of anomalous narcotics. I can't tell you how many healthy kids walked in through our doors.

And just how many have laid in my arms, sporting grotesque lumps whilst leaking fluids, just before we throw them in the furnace. I remember the thick yellow tears dripping from this one boy's eyes. Even through his bile colored cataracts, he made perfect eye contact with me.

All he wanted from me was his bear. I couldn't handle the pain in my chest, I barely remember what that feels like now. I walked his lanky figure toward the hatch. I wanted everything to be over with, so I quickly tossed him inside without listening to another word.

 At this point I'm truly no different from those devils who called my name. That brings me and you to the present day. 

I've made my decision. The cafeteria is simply too much of a risk now, it is to be considered compromised. The restrooms should be able to spare plenty of liquid soap, and with this extra coat I have bandage material.

 I really wont like this next part.

I made my way to the restrooms the moment I was done with my friend. I tried my best to keep my breathing steady, thinking on what's to come will only slow me down. As I neared the bright red door my legs began to weaken. And as my hand rose to the handle, I noticed my fingers shaking.

I stared in the mirror, sweat was dripping down my nose onto my soaked collar. I placed my arm along the sink's edge. “Deep breaths, if you pass out here you'll bleed out.” Words I needed to hear, but of which failed to come to me in the moment. I wish I could tell you that I handled it well, that I only had slight struggle.

But the immediate pain as I drove the kitchen knife into my faded scar was immeasurable. It felt as though liquid metal was dripping through the wound. I pierced a small plastic lining during the digging period, which itself felt like it lasted eons. My head drooped increasingly numb as my entire body grew heavy.

I pulled on the corner of the plastic, and out popped a clear bag filled with small electrical components, still larger than the security chip. Simply based on its archaic composition, it was clear my research chip was an older model.

Pushing through the continuous, searing pain, I dropped the freshly bloodied chip into the bin. A trail of warm red dotted the length of the lid to the faucet. My dripping arm was slick with more sweat than blood. Salt began settling into the wound, forcing me to throw my arm under the faucet.

Pressure was building behind my face while my vision darkened. “No, don't lay down. I should lay down. But I'm still not done, I can't die here. Yet the floor looks so soft, and I'm so tired. Nothing bad will happen if I just.” The last thing I saw was the ceramic faucet racing toward my eyes.

 With a sharp breath, I shot up from against the toilet. Panicking I tossed up my sore arm, The coat tightly wrapped my wound numerous times. A wave of tiring chill washed through my body, until I saw the way it was tied.

 I've never seen this knot before. 

The stall door was locked shut, and the lights in the bathroom were more dim than I'd remembered. I twisted the latch, and gave my best push through my good arm. Something was blocking the door. Through the small gap I was able to make out someone sitting against it.

They would twitch and pull in unnatural ways, glued to the other side of my door. I had no choice but to crawl across the freezing tile, through the gap into the handicap stall. My arm hurt with every swipe along the floor, when I peered my head at the next stalls open door, then at the pot. 

A bright red puddle, and not just that. The toilet in this stall was shattered, and tiny shards of porcelain pricked the underside of my arms. As I hopped to my weak feet, I felt a lump growing in my throat.

 Making sure to hug the wall with my back, I slowly peered past the door to the blockage. The horrific sight that followed left me wishing I just ran through the door to anywhere else. 

One of my peers sat convulsing against the door. He was missing a rather large portion of his head, his lips coated in bright red. Not blood, he stopped bleeding a long time ago. Sitting over his open cranium was a scout, Its spindling sinew wriggled into the folds of his brain.

They coiled into his nose whilst the creature unfolded along the length of his arms, ripping through his skin. His eyes darted around the room senselessly until they finally rested upon me.

I couldn't look away, I was hypnotized by this fresh display of data. We've never seen them react with other creatures like this.

The man's arm slammed against the stall, his legs were now kicking across the floor as if trying to swim. This crude display of mobility seared into my mind, leaving the impression that I should probably leave quickly. And so I nervously hopped across the animating corpse, bashing the door into the now dim hall. 

As my foot made contact with the hall tile I nearly slipped on a puddle of dark blood. I caught myself against the wall on my arm, which made me yelp in searing pain. “Damn you filthy piece of-” a loud groan of escaping air came from the bathroom, reminding me to keep moving.

But where was I moving to? My head was still light, and my thoughts felt like I was trying to wade through a swamp. My stomach is furious, when was my last meal? Joints ache while muscles burn. It's all so much. 

Which hallway was this? Why is blood dripping from my forehead? My shoulder met a locker with healthy force. Metal shelter. I could barely wrap my hand around the latch. I fell in slamming my side against a stack of books. The pain just made my vision more white. I winced as I pulled the door shut with the last of my breath. 

I just need to rest.

1prel8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1prel8z/day_2_of_my_new_life/,Day 2 of my new life!,"Took the plunge on Thursday night. It's now Saturday morning. Wanted to share my first day experience because I know there will be others who were scared to start like me.

The day of my shot I just tried to eat well. It was an office day for me and I actually tend to eat better in the office because I pack my food so there's no access to snacks etc. That night I took the shot out of the fridge about an hr before I took it, took a warm shower and then sat down to do the shot.

I chose my right thigh as I have read the general consensus is the thigh is the best spot for less side effects. I was worried about nausea mostly. 

Come to find out the anti anxiety med I was already on is also fda approved for nausea so I popped one of those after too.

It was hard getting over the anticipation of the shot! I had needles, I was scared to push the button. But after a few minutes I just counted to 3 and pushed. It was nothing!! Barely felt it at all. And quick. It says up to 10 seconds, I think it took 3 if that lol. After that I could almost feel the meds moving through my leg, like a warming sensation, but that passed quickly.

Went to bed. Slept inclined because I do have GERD so I wanted to avoid making it worse. Woke up feeling like I had mild flu symptoms. Not full blown nausea, but icky. I also get that from GERD symptoms. I take omeprazole magnesium daily btw. 

Drank some chamomile tea and water, skipped coffee altogether. I just could not stomach it. Ate some oatmeal around 11am. Felt fine, just almost felt like my stomach was heavy. Not full like I was going to explode, just very aware of my stomach if that makes sense.

Ate a protein bar around 1 and then a bunless burger with cheese around 645. It wasn't a great eating day but at least I got food and protein in.

I will say I failed at getting my actual starting weight thursday. I ended up weighing myself Thursday night but we know EOD weight is different. It was 171.2. I weighed myself friday morning for a better idea and I was 169. 

Sleep was fine, slept inclined again and took the same meds. Woke up feeling better than yesterday, still a little blah. I did step on the scale and I was 167.2. Do I think its related? No lol. We know we can bounce around. I probably wont weigh myself again until next Thursday morning (merry Christmas to me lol) 

Anyway, happy with the mild effects so far! ",3,1766237991.0,Zepbound,1,1.0,False
1prel5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/putdotio/comments/1prel5k/are_you_looking_after_ultimate_truth/,are you looking after ultimate truth,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I shrugged and opened it anyway in an alcohol fueled haze. *Maybe I got the lucky one,* I thought.



Maybe the unlucky one instead.



As soon as I popped the top, a thick blue smoke began to pour from the can, filling the room. When I tell you that immediately I freaked out, oh, man, I mean it. I pulled my shirt up over my mouth and nose, and started waving my hands over the can, trying to disperse the strange fog. My mind immediately went to chemical warfare, mustard gas, Agent Orange. I’d been fairly outspoken at the time about political issues, but… who would really try to take me out like that?  
  
**“It’s not going to hurt you.”**



I jumped, swore, and turned. *Who the fuck?* But when I saw the tall blue-skinned man in the corner of my room, I felt all the color drain from my face. *There’s no way… what?*



“You’re… uh… what?”  
  
**“I am your genie. You have released me from my prison, for which I thank you, and now grant you the customary three wishes. Be warned, h-”**  
  
I cut him off as I continued freaking out. “WHAT. No. Get the fuck- wait… How did you get in here? I’ll call the cops right now, I swear to god. Get out of my fucking house.” He chuckled, and continued.



**“You opened my vestibule. I am now in your service for the duration of three wishes. But be warned, human, your wishes will not always come to fruition as you expect.”**  
  
A genie. A literal fucking genie. I want you to picture this with me. It’s 4 AM, I’m positively hammered, and there’s a FUCKING GENIE standing three feet away from me. Should I trust this? No. But am I going to? Of course.



*I know what I want my first wish to be, but… I have to test this first. Have to make sure this will work out like I want.*



I cleared my throat, and looked over at the genie. “I wish I had three million dollars.”  
  
**“Wish granted. You had three million dollars, which you promptly lost gambling.”**  
  


*Fuck.* “Okay, I see what you did there. I wish my mother was still alive, cancer free, debt free, living in this city.”  
  
**“Wish granted. Your mother is alive, well, and wants nothing to do with you.”**  
  
I snatched my phone off of the coffee table faster than I ever have, and called my mom’s number. She answered with an exasperated sigh. Even that was music to my ears.  
  
“Ryan, what do you want this time? You know I’m busy,” she said. I choked up, took a second to compose myself, and finally answered. “Hey, uh… nothing really, mom. I just wanted to hear your voice.” She scoffed. “Don’t call me again. I can’t do anything to help you, Ryan.” 



Tears fell down my face as I hung up the phone. “You were right, I guess…” I said to the genie.



**“I warned you, child.”**



It was at that moment that I absolutely lost my mind. “This is your fucking fault! I didn’t ask for this! What, you just show up whenever you want and fuck with people’s heads? What fucking good are you?!” The genie didn’t react at all. Just responded.



**“You opened the beer, child. I only answered the call.”**  
  
I’m ashamed to admit that I spent longer than I’d have liked destroying my room and trying to hurt the genie… Everything I threw at him went through his body as if he was entirely incorporeal. After twenty minutes or so, I realised what I was doing wasn’t actually doing anything. I sighed, sat down, and grabbed my last beer from the case, which I’d unfortunately forgotten to put in the fridge.

I tried to say “I wish this beer was cold,” but I was drunk, on edge, still freaking out. I think I misspoke. I think what I actually said was, “I wish this beer was gold.”  
  
**“Wish granted.”**",2,1766237770.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I have been on a low acid diet for 12 months. I cut out all the “triggers” and eat 80% one ingredient foods. My weekly diet consists of fish, chicken, turkey, rice, potatoes and veggies. I’ve followed this religiously for about 9 months and then I started to allow myself to have more, but I just eat less of it. Example, I’ll have pasta, but only eat half. Have coffee 1x a week, but with food. I’ll have alcohol, but only 1 glass with food and definitely do not have these triggers daily or even weekly. Just Every once in a while.

What’s interesting after meeting with my GI from the Cleveland Clinic he said that “diets don't really work that much anyways. It's a lot of effort, but we knew it really wouldn't work because in studies it doesn't help much at all. Don't torture yourself.""  

While I can agree with him about the not torturing myself part, I was honestly surprised he felt that way about cutting out the typical reflux triggers and processed foods. I have a HH and a weak LES and he feels that diet and medicine can only take me so far when I have a mechanical issue. 

Background my HH is 3cm, weak LES, have lost 30lbs this year. On 80mg PPI for now and we’re going to try and add amitrityline for nerve hypersensitivity. PH showed severe gerd mainly at night, which my symptoms are usually the worse in the early morning. 

While diet I believe has helped, especially with the weight loss, he’s right that despite my clean eating, I still have symptoms. He said he wasn’t dismissing the diet, but said the following as well

❌ No proof that low-acid or “clean eating” fixes GERD universally

New Profitec Ride owner here. I purchased the all black model from Clive with the Lucca flow control installed. After using for about a week, I have a couple of questions that Clive is struggling to answer:

1. My understanding is that the flow control paddle should move about 270 degrees counterclockwise from full close to full open. However, my paddle makes almost 2 full revolutions. Is this normal? I can stop it early, but should the paddle move that much? In addition, once I open the flow, the pressure on the Lucca gauge quickly goes to 10+. (This while using a double filter basket with 18g on board and an E&B puck screen). The coffee comes out fine, maybe a bit slow, but evenly and it tastes great. I’m currently using GH Alchemy.

2. I am trying to understand the differences between Power On/Off, Scheduled On/Off, ECO Mode, and Standby.  My goal is to use the machine daily at 7am and 7pm for a couple of shots each time and I want to minimize the thermal impact from cycling the machine.

* Is it true that if the machine has a “scheduled on” time at 7am, but I had “powered off” the machine the night before with the power button, the schedule will not turn on the machine?  That is, the machine must be “powered on” in order for the schedule to work?  (I know that “Timer Enabled” setting must be on for the schedule to be active.)

*  When a scheduled time to turn the machine “off” kicks in, what actually happens?  Is the machine exactly like being “powered off” except that the schedule will be honored (and the power button is lit)?
 
* If I have ECO mode set to kick in after 30 minutes of non-use, what actually happens?  How is this different from “scheduled off” (in terms of what gets “turned off”)?

* What is Standby mode, which kicks in sooner than ECO mode.  What actually happens in Standby Mode, and how is this different than ECO mode?

* And finally! For using the machine twice a day, 12 hours apart, is it better for the machine to be powered on/off manually each time, or use a schedule, or use ECO mode during the day with a schedule to shut the machine down at night and turn it up in the morning?

I have seen other threads that discuss the use of a smart switch, but I am trying to understand how the machine itself was designed to manage power and thermal stress.

---

The morning sun filtered through Abi's curtains. She blinked awake slowly, the remnants of sleep clinging to her like a comfortable weight. David's arm was draped across her waist, heavy and solid. His breathing was slow and even against the back of her neck. 

*Bliss*

She reached for her phone, carefully, trying not to disturb him, and thumbed the screen awake. The notification glowed cold and blue in the soft morning light:

**Queens of the Pitch 💚⚽ - 63 unread messages**

Her stomach dropped.

She unlocked the phone, scrolling through the messages with mounting dread. The chat had been active since late last night, since she and David had left the social separately together. The messages weren't cruel, not exactly. But they were pointed.

*Someone had fun last night 👀*

*Did you see Abi leave with the rugby boy?*

*The first-year? Seriously?*

*I mean, he's cute, but isn't that a bit young?*

River's message stood out, sharp and cutting: *Guess she likes them fresh.*

Abi's face burned. She scrolled further, her chest tightening with each swipe. More jokes. More questions about what they had in common, what the appeal was, pointed comments about the age gap filtered through casual teasing.

She locked the phone and set it face-down on the nightstand, her hand trembling slightly. Behind her, David shifted in his sleep, his arm tightening around her waist instinctively. The gesture was protective, affectionate, and it made her throat tighten.

*They're all talking about me. About us. About what it says about me.*

She stared at the wall, her mind racing. The warmth of his body against hers, which had felt so safe moments ago, now felt suffocating.

The days that followed blurred together in a haze of avoidance.

Abi stopped initiating. David sent her a text the next afternoon, something light, something sweet, something like they had done so many times over the past few weeks, and she replied hours later with a single sentence. *Busy with thesis stuff.* When he suggested meeting for coffee, she deflected. *Swamped this week, sorry.* He tried again a few days later. *Rain check?* she replied, offering nothing concrete.

Their contact dwindled from multiple times a week to once, maybe twice. The fifteen-minute window at the pitch, the one David had so carefully carved out for weeks, became unbearable for her. She started arriving later, timing it so her team was already warming up when she got there. No chance of accidental eye contact. No chance of River's pointed comments. 

*Fucking River*

David noticed. Of course he noticed. At first, he told himself it was just bad timing, she was a fourth-year, after all, buried in her thesis and grad school applications. But the excuses wore thin, and eventually, he stopped asking. The hurt was there, quiet and persistent, but he buried it. If she didn't want to see him, he wasn't going to chase any longer.

He matched her energy. Pulled back. Protected himself.

*If she'd want me, she would initiate contact again, right?*

The distance between them widened into a cold, careful silence, and neither one knew how to cross it.

At home, David sat on the couch as he checked the time on his phone.

18:00.

*Used to be halfway to the pitch by now.*

He'd stopped showing up early weeks ago. Stopped pretending it was about extra conditioning when it was really about those fifteen minutes before her training started. She'd made it clear she didn't want him there, not through words, but through the careful, polite distance she'd put between them.

*Can't keep doing that. Not anymore.*

He opened his messages.

**[18:00] Me:** Gym?
**[18:00] Kelly, Liam:** Grand

David pocketed his phone and stood.

Liam was already on one of the fitness bikes when David arrived, pedaling at an easy warm-up pace. He nodded as David climbed onto the bike next to him.

They settled into some light conversation, the rhythmic whir of the wheels filling being a constant background noise.

After ten minutes, they moved to the squat rack.

David loaded the bar while Liam chalked his hands. The familiar clang of iron plates settling into place was grounding. Solid. Real.

David ducked under the bar and positioned it across his shoulders. He gripped the bar, took a deep breath, and lifted it off the rack. The weight settled across his shoulders, honest, unambiguous pressure. He stepped back, set his stance, then descended. The bar pressed down on him, heavy and true. He drove back up, exhaled, and descended again.

_The Iron never lies._

It was a line from an essay he'd found late one night, weeks ago now, when he couldn't sleep. Some old punk rocker writing about the gym like it was therapy. David had read it twice, then saved it. It had resonated with him, the philosophy had felt like solid ground.

_You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk. The Iron will always kick you the real deal._

He finished his set and stepped forward, racking the bar with a heavy clang. He stepped back, chest rising and falling.

Liam took his place without a word, settling under the bar for his own set.

David stood to the side, watching but not really seeing. His mind was still on the weight. On the clarity of it.

Liam finished and stepped back. ""Your go.""

David moved back under the bar. Gripped it. Lifted it off the rack. The weight settled across his shoulders again, and he stepped back.

_Weeks of this; weeks since I stopped showing up early._

He descended. The pressure was clean. Predictable. It didn't send mixed signals. It didn't grow cold for reasons he couldn't name.

He drove up. Descended again.

_Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds._

He finished the set and racked the bar, the clang echoing in the space.

That evening, at the end of training, the coach called the team in. David was still catching his breath when the voice cut through the noise.

""Roberts.""

David looked up.

""Time to shine. You're up for the first team come Saturday. We've had injuries, and you've been putting in the work.""

David blinked. ""Yeah. Thank you, coach.""

The coach nodded and turned his attention back to the rest of the squad.

Later, David sat on his bed, phone in hand. He stared at Abi's contact for a long moment.

*Want to tell someone. Want to tell her.*

They'd barely spoken in weeks. A few brief texts, one awkward coffee where they'd both been too polite, too careful. She'd pulled away, and he'd let her. After all, it was easier that way.

But this felt different. This felt like something she'd actually care about, or at least something she used to.

He opened the message thread, *she probably won't respond anyway* but he typed anyway.

**[22:31] Me:** Hey
**[22:32] Me:** Got called up to the first team for Saturday, as a sub
**[22:32] Me:** Time to play with the big boys
**[23:01] Abi:** That's great, congrats.

Abi sat at her desk, laptop open, surrounded by stacks of papers and half-filled notebooks. 23 open tabs of ResearchGate, Sci-Hub, and other papers. Her thesis supervisor's latest email glowed on the screen, a polite but firm reminder that her literature review needed ""significant expansion"" before the next meeting. She'd saw the same paragraph for the third time, but hadn't read any of it.

Her phone had buzzed and she glanced at it, saw David's name, and her stomach dropped.

She stared at the messages. Read it again. Her throat tightened.

*He's still texting me. After weeks of one-word replies and cancelled coffees, he's still reaching out.*

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard. She started typing: **""😍 That's amazing! Can we""**

She deleted it.

Tried again: **""🎉 David I'm so proud of""**

Deleted.

She typed: **""That's great, congrats.""**

Four words. Couldn't even manage a full sentence for the man who hadn't left her head in weeks.

*Perfect. Fucking perfect Abi. Cold and distant. Exactly what he deserves after sharing something that matters to him. Exactly what he deserves from someone who wants to care about him so desperately.*

She hit send and then tossed the phone onto her bed like it had burned her.

She tried to refocus on the thesis. The words on the screen blurred.

Two days later, her phone buzzed again. This time it was Chloe.

**[14:11] Chloe:** The rugby boys are playing next Saturday
**[14:11] Chloe:** Their first team
**[14:12] Chloe:** I need a break from the library dungeon, you wanna come?
**[14:13] Me:** Yeah, sure. Sounds good.
**[14:13] Chloe:** Brilliant. Meet at the pitch at 2?
**[14:13] Me:** See you there.

Her heart had jumped. *He'll be playing.* She'd read his texts more times than she wanted to admit: the call-up, the ""big boys"" joke, the fact that he'd told her at all after weeks of her cold, one-word replies.

Abi locked her phone and set it down. She sat in the silence of her flat, staring at the wall.

*It's not about him. It's just a match. Just something to do. Chloe suggested it.*

The lie sat heavy in her chest, transparent even to herself.

Abi and Chloe arrived early. The pitch was alive with energy, the stands already half-full, the air buzzing with pre-match excitement. The team was warming up on the field, running drills, passing the ball, their movements sharp and purposeful.

Abi scanned the pitch instinctively. Her eyes found him almost immediately.

David was stretching near the sideline, his body bent forward, hands gripping his ankles. Even from a distance, she could see the definition in his shoulders, the solid line of his back. He straightened, rolled his neck, and jogged toward the group.

Her chest tightened.

Chloe, settling into a seat on the cold metal bleachers, scanned the field casually. ""Oh, there's Liam,"" she said, a slight smirk playing at the corner of her mouth. ""The one with the chat."" She paused, eyes narrowing playfully. ""Man's built like he's compensating for something, but in a good way.""

Abi didn't respond. She was still watching David.

Chloe followed her gaze. ""And there's David, right?"" A small smirk crept onto her face. ""The one Liam was trying to set you up with.""

Abi's heart skipped.

Chloe tilted her head, mildly impressed. ""Huh. Didn't realize he made the first team. Good for him.""

*Yeah, that is good for him.*

Chloe leaned back, stretching her legs out in front of her. ""This should be fun. Been a while since I watched a proper match.""

Abi barely heard her. Her eyes were locked on David as he moved through the warm-up, jogging, pivoting, his body powerful and controlled. He laughed at something Liam said, his face open and easy.

*He's like a golden retriever in human form,* she thought, the comparison arriving unbidden. *Sweet, eager, impossibly earnest.*

But then he bent to pick up the ball, his thighs flexing, his hands gripping the white leather panels with casual strength, and her breath caught.

*Except golden retrievers don't look like that in a rugby kit. And they definitely don't make me feel like this.*

Her thighs pressed together involuntarily.

The smell of grass and sweat hung in the air. The cold metal of the bleachers pressed against her thighs. The crowd's chatter rose and fell around her, but all of it felt distant, muffled.

She couldn't stop watching him.

The halftime whistle blows. David's team is losing. 

David sits on the bench in the changing room. He's been watching the entire first half from the sideline, watching his team get pushed back, watching them lose ground. His legs are restless, his hands clenched. He hasn't played yet, but his body is coiled tight, ready.

*Should be out there.*

The captain stands in the center of the room, muddied, and speaks:

""Listen to me now, listen to me. I want them standing back thinking what the fuck is going on here. Not for the first five minutes, every fucking minute of the game. Fucking manic aggression. Did you scare anyone? Did you fuckin' put the fear of God into anyone?""

The room is silent. David feels the words land in his chest.

Beside him, Liam mutters under his breath, just loud enough for David to hear: ""He lifted that straight off O'Connell, he did.""

The coach calls out: ""All right, on your feet, on your feet, we're on the running.""

The team rises as one, heading for the door. David stands, his heart pounding now, adrenaline flooding his system. The coach grabs his arm as he passes.

""Roberts. You're on in the second half.""

David nods. ""Right.""

Coach looks him in the eye. ""What are you going to do once you get that ball?""

""Run.""

""And?""

David's jaw sets. ""I'm not stopping until I see either God or the goal line.""

The coach claps him on the shoulder. ""Good man.""

The second half begins. David sits on the bench, his eyes locked on the pitch. Every muscle in his body is tense, ready. Chloe is saying something, but Abi barely hears her. Her eyes are on the bench, on David, on the way he's leaning forward like he's about to launch himself onto the field.

*He looks ready to explode.*

Ten minutes into the half, coach calls David's number. He jogs onto the pitch, and the moment he steps onto the grass, something shifts. Abi watches him move, powerful, focused, aggressive. He's not hesitant. He's not awkward. He's in his element.

The first contact, a thumping tackle on an attacker.

*God.*

She watches him get up, radiant, alive.

*Where has he been?*

Now his team is on the attack. David gets the ball. The first defender lunges for the tackle, David slips the tackle and presses on. The second defender hits, the hit is solid, but David wins the contact, drives forward, his face set in feral determination.

Abi's breath catches. *He's not stopping.*

A third defender joins, two of them hanging off him now, trying to drag him down. 

*He's not stopping!*

He wrestles, drives forward with raw, single-minded power, the ball clutched tight against his chest. His legs working, his body straining.

He crashes over the line.

For a moment, nothing.

Then the sharp, piercing sound of the whistle.

Try.

The crowd erupts. David gets to his feet, and his face is radiant with pure, unfiltered joy. He's grinning, chest heaving, and for a moment, he's the most alive person Abi has ever seen.

Her whole body is tight with want. She can barely breathe.

*That's him.*

David, still buzzing, scans the crowd. His eyes find Abi. They lock for a brief moment, a second, maybe two. He's smiling, and the smile doesn't fade when he sees her. Something flickers in his eyes, his smile widens just slightly.

Then he turns back to his teammates.

Abi watches him go. 

*He saw me.*

She feels the weight of it settle in her chest. He's out there, radiant and alive, and she's sitting here, watching from the sidelines of his life.

David sat on the edge of his bed in his boxer briefs, elbows on his knees, staring at nothing in particular. The day had been long. The high from the match, the try, the win, the celebration, had faded hours ago, leaving behind a dull ache in his body from all the physicality of the day.

The flat was quiet. His flatmates were out. His team mates were still riding the post-win energy. He'd gone along for the aftermath, listened to Liam tell the story of his try *""absolute scenes, lads, he just kept fucking running""* to anyone who'd listen and a few who couldn't care. David had smiled, nodded and hade made his excuses.

Now he was here. Alone. Tired. Sore.

And restless.

He lay back on the bed, one arm behind his head, and closed his eyes. The memories from the day flickered through his mind in fragments: the roar of the crowd, that one tackle, the impact of the defenders trying to drag him down, the moment he crossed the line. The win. The celebration.

*Abi.*

The roar of the crowd. That one tackle. The defenders.

*Abi.*

The impact. The score.

*Abi.*

The win.

*Abi.*

He opened his eyes, stared at the ceiling.

He'd seen her. In the stands. Just for a second, right after the try. Their eyes had locked, and his heart had jumped, this stupid, involuntary flutter in his chest that had nothing to do with the exertion or the adrenaline. She'd been *there*. She'd come to watch. That had to mean something.

And then the game had continued, and he'd let the moment slip away.

He shifted on the bed, felt the tension coiled tight in his body. It wasn't just the soreness from the match. It was something else. Something that had been building for weeks, ever since she'd started pulling away.

Weeks ago, unable to sleep, he'd found that essay. Henry Rollins talking about the Iron like it was the one honest thing in a world full of noise. David had latched onto it hungry for something that made sense, something he could control. He'd stopped showing up early to the pitch. Started loading bar after bar at the gym instead.

The weights had made him stronger. They'd given him something to do with his hands, something to think about besides her. But lying here now, his body still hummed with the same ache. The gym had never been about forgetting. Just about keeping busy.

He reached for his phone on the nightstand, unlocked it, scrolled aimlessly through social media. Photos from the match were already up: someone had tagged him in a post, Liam mid-storytelling, the team huddled together in celebration. He scrolled past them. Opened his streaming app, stared at the list of shows he'd been meaning to watch, felt no interest whatsoever. Considered texting Liam just to have something to do.

His thumb hovered over the messages app.

Her name was right there.

He sighed, put the phone down, rubbed his face with both hands.

*Fuck it.*

He lay back, let his hand drift down to the waistband of his boxer briefs. He was already half-hard, had been for a while without really noticing. He pulled his cock out, wrapped his hand around it, closed his eyes.

He tried to think about someone else. Anyone else. Hot girls from his course, a celebrity he'd seen on TV, some vague, faceless fantasy. His mind refused to cooperate. It drifted, inevitably, back to *her*.

He stroked himself slowly, felt his cock harden fully in his grip.

The festival. The tent. The way she'd bent over in front of him, her ass right there, practically in his face, and he'd been too dense to see it for what it was. The smell of her, shampoo and skin and something indefinably *her*. The way she'd looked at him, exasperated and amused, when she'd finally spelled it out for him.

*David, next time a girl asks for help, barely dressed, late at night, in her tent... just get the hint.*

His hand moved faster.

That night. Her straddling him in his tent, bare, no barriers, just heat and tightness and the overwhelming sensation of being inside her. The way she'd ridden him, confident and in control, her tits bouncing, her head thrown back. The way he'd finished inside her, raw, unprotected, intimate in a way that had felt impossibly significant.

He was getting close. His breath quickened. His grip tightened.

His mind jumped forward. The morning after, her bent over in front of him, his cock sliding in and out of her, glistening and slick. The way she'd demanded he fill her again, her voice rough and commanding. *I want to feel you cum inside me.*

The image pushed him closer to the edge.

But then his mind betrayed him. It drifted to her apartment. The way she'd kissed him that night in her flat, after, soft and lingering. The way she'd looked at him the morning after he'd stayed over, tangled in her sheets, warm and sleepy and *right*. The good morning kiss that had felt like a promise.

And then the way she'd bolted.

*No. No, that's not helpful.*

He forced his mind back. Back to the sex. Back to the purely physical. Her on her knees, face down, ass up, his cock sliding into her from behind. The way her body had looked, toned and perfect, the curve of her back, the way she'd gripped the sheets. The way she'd come around him, tight and pulsing, her voice breaking as she said his name.

That did it.

He came with a soft grunt, his body tensing, hot spurts of cum landing on his stomach. For a moment, there was nothing but the release, mechanical, physical, satisfying.

And then, as his breathing slowed and the haze cleared, the images in his mind shifted.

Not Abi naked and riding him. Not Abi bent over or on her knees.

Abi asleep in his arms, her face soft and unguarded. Abi laughing across from him in the café, her eyes bright with amusement at one of his nerdy jokes. Abi looking at him after sex, not with desire, but with something warmer, softer.

He reached for the tissues on his nightstand, cleaned himself up with mechanical efficiency, tossed them in the bin. Lay back down. Stared at the ceiling for a long moment.

*She made me happy. That's what she did. And the Iron couldn't do a fucking thing about it.*

He lay in the dark for a long time, mind racing. The flat was silent around him. His phone lay on his chest, face-down, its weight a small, solid pressure. Finally, quietly, almost without deciding to, he picked it up. Unlocked it. Opened messages. Scrolled to her name.

Her contact filled the screen.

He stared at it for a long moment. *She doesn't want to this anymore. She's made that clear.*

But the hollow ache was unbearable, and the memory of seeing her at the match, the brief eye contact, the flicker of *something*. It wouldn't let him rest.

He started typing.

**""I saw you today. It was good to see you. I've missed""**

Deleted it.

Tried again.

**""Hey. Thanks for coming to the match. It meant""**

Deleted it.

A third time. Something simpler. Something that didn't ask for too much, that protected him if she ignored it, that was honest but not desperate.

**[22:32] Roberts, David:** Hey
**[22:33] Roberts, David:** It was good to see you today
**[23:47] Me:** Congrats on the win
**[23:48] Me:** You played really well :)

Abi sat slumped at her desk, laptop glowing with the same thesis pdf she'd been pretending to read for an hour. Her phone lay beside the keyboard, next to the miniature rugby ball David had given her, wedged between a stack of notes and a cold mug.

She'd watched the messages arrive. The first one at 22:32, and the second at 22:33. One hour and fourteen minutes of cowardice sat there in timestamp form while she thumbed the ball's raised seams.

""Give rugby a try,"" he'd said as he gave it to her during a late study session. ""Look, it's already got its name on it,"" he'd said, tapping the side. ""Gilbert. Very distinguished.""

She'd rolled her eyes and kept it anyway. Now it sat there while she typed and deleted and typed again.

**I miss you. I'm sorry. I've been a complete mess and seeing you today broke something open in me that I've been trying so hard to keep sealed and I don't know how to fix**

Deleted.

**Can we talk? I need to explain why I've been**

Deleted.

She wanted to say *everything*. Wanted to tell him she'd been miserable for weeks, that watching him play today had cracked her wide open, that she was sorry, that she missed him so much it made her chest ache.

Instead: ""Congrats on the win. You played really well :)""

*With a fucking smiley face.*

She scrolled back up. Read his message again.

**It was good to see you today.**

Simple. Warm. Reaching out to her after weeks giving him the cold shoulder, weeks of her deliberate retreat.

And again she'd shut the door in his face.

She put the phone face-down on her desk and pressed the heels of her hands against her eyes.

*God, Abi.*

Her throat was tight. Her chest ached. And she had no one to blame but herself.

She sat there for a long time, staring at nothing.

Her body hadn't settled since the match. The tension had been building all evening, through coffee with Chloe, through the walk home, through the last two hours alone in the dark.

It hadn't gone away.

She shifted in her chair. Her thighs pressed together unconsciously, and the friction sent a shudder down her spine.

*Fine.*

She stood, crossed to the bed, and lay down on top of the covers. The room was dark except for the faint glow from the streetlight outside filtering through the curtains.

She hooked her thumbs into the waistband of her sweatpants and pushed them down her legs, kicking them off onto the floor. Her underwear followed a moment later.

The air was cool against her skin.

She closed her eyes.

Slid her hand down her stomach, between her legs.

She was already wet, slick from hours of unresolved tension. Her fingers found her clit, circling it slowly, testing the pressure.

The fantasy came easily. Vivid. David on the pitch, muscles straining as he fought off the tackle. The ball pressed tight against his chest, his jaw set, his whole body focused on one single goal. The raw determination on his face. The way he'd driven forward, refusing to go down even with two defenders hanging off him.

Her breath quickened. She pressed harder, the rhythm building.

The image shifted, blending with memory. The post-social night. His hands gripping her hips, flipping her from her back to her knees in one effortless motion. The way he'd filled her, deep and relentless. The intensity in his eyes when he looked at her after, soft and unguarded.

Her free hand moved to her breast, squeezing, rolling her nipple between her fingers. The dual sensation made her arch off the bed.

She pictured his mouth on her. The way he'd gone down on her that first morning after the festival, eager and focused, learning exactly what made her gasp. The memory of his tongue, the patience, the way he'd listened to her body.

Her fingers moved faster, chasing the building tension.

She slipped one finger inside herself, then a second, curling them the way he had. The stretch, the pressure. Her hips lifted off the bed, seeking more.

*David.*

His voice, drowsy and warm against her ear: *I like you.*

The way he'd held her after. The solid weight of his arm across her waist. The steady rhythm of his breathing. The safety of it.

Her hand moved in deliberate, focused strokes now, her fingers working her clit while her other hand pinched her nipple hard enough to make her gasp.

She was close. So close.

The arousal built, tightening low in her belly. Her thighs trembled. Her breath came in short, sharp gasps.

Almost there. Almost

And then her brain intruded.

*He's nineteen. I'm twenty-two.*

The thought landed like ice water. Her rhythm faltered.

*What does this say about me?*

She tried to push it away, refocusing on the fantasy. On his body. On the sex. On the pure physical pleasure of it.

But the thoughts kept coming, relentless.

River's voice, sharp and cutting: *Like raiding a daycare or something.*

The group chat messages. The pointed jokes. The judgment.

*Everyone knows. Everyone's talking about it.*

Her hand slowed despite herself.

*A fourth-year with a first-year. What kind of person does that make me?*

No. She squeezed her eyes tighter, fighting to stay in the moment. She focused harder on the memory. On David's hands on her body, on the way he'd made her come, on the raw physicality of it.

Her fingers resumed their rhythm, more forceful now, trying to outpace the intrusive thoughts.

The image returned: David under her, riding him as his hands gripped her hips tightly. Grinding her on his cock, filling her up completely.

The arousal flickered back to life. Her breath quickened again.

She was close. She could feel it building again, the tension coiling tight.

*Just stay here. Stay in this.*

Her eyes, unfocused in the dim light, drifted across the room and landed on her desk.

On the ball sitting there. 

*Gilbert*

The memory flashed. Sharp and unbidden.

David grinning at her, holding the ball out during a late study session. *""Give rugby a try. Look, it's already got its name on it. Gilbert. Very distinguished.""* 

She'd laughed. Rolled her eyes. Kept it anyway.

She could still see his face. The way he'd lit up. Pure, unguarded joy at his own terrible pun.

*That's what I used to do. I used to make him smile like that.*

The thought settled, heavy and aching.

*I used to be the thing that made him happy.*

Her hand stilled between her legs.

Now the ball just sat there. A gift. A stupid joke. A memento of a version of them that didn't exist anymore.

And he still loved rugby. Still found joy there. On the pitch today he'd been radiant, laughing with his teammates, glowing with the win.

*He's happy without me.*

The realization crystallized, absurd and devastating:

*I'm jealous of a fucking ball.*

Her hand froze completely.

*That ball gets to make him smile. That ball gets his joy. And I used to have that. I had all of it.*

She saw it again. David on the pitch after the try, turning back to his teammates. The ease of it. The happiness that didn't need her.

*I had that. I was that for him. And now I'm just the reason he's miserable.*

The arousal died instantly. Evaporated like steam.

A sharp, broken laugh escaped her throat. Then another. Hysterical, cracking at the edges.

The laughter turned to full, body-wracking sobs.

Fragmented sensory memories flashed through her mind, sharp and painful:

*His arm, heavy and warm across her waist.*

*The sound of his breathing, steady against her ear.*

*The way he looked at her after, his eyes soft and unguarded.*

*His voice, drowsy: ""I like you.""*

*Her throat tight, the words right there: ""I like you too."" But she couldn't say them. Couldn't move. Couldn't breathe.*

*The bliss of falling asleep together, sated and safe.*

*And her silence. Her fucking cowardice.*

The memories intensified the crying. Her whole body shook with it, tears soaking the pillow, gasping breaths tearing from her chest.

*I had that. I had all of that. And I didn't just run. I pushed him away.*

She curled onto her side, knees pulled to her chest, arms wrapped tight around herself.

The sobs came in waves, each one harder than the last.

The phone on the desk. The cold reply still sitting there, glowing in the dark.

*You played really well.*

*With a fucking smiley face.*

Another wave of crying crashed through her, until finally the crying subsided.

Abi lay in the dark, tears drying on her face, completely spent. The emotional storm had passed, leaving behind a terrible, clear-eyed understanding.

The room was silent except for her breathing. Ragged, uneven, slowly steadying.

On the desk, her phone lay face-down beside the rugby ball. David's text unanswered in any meaningful way. The cold, distant reply still the last thing she'd sent.

The weight of her realization pressed down on her, heavy and undeniable.

She stared at nothing, eyes open in the dark.

After a long journey - starting with therapy because of my depression, figuring out that my depression was just covering my ADHD, getting my diagnosis and finally getting medication for it ❤️💊

So now I am on day two since I’ve started Ritalin and wanted to sanity-check my first experiences and questions with people who’ve been there.

What I noticed so far:

I have less racing thoughts

Also my “head radio” at least reduced the numbers of songs played

I was generally calmer and emotionally less reactive on the first day, but had less effect on the second day

The comedown was very smooth, I had no crash, which is nice

My side effects: dry mouth, slight headache

What confuses me:

The same dose felt different depending on when I took the medication (afternoon dose felt calmer, morning dose feels less effective)

I still feel strong pulls toward more interesting tasks (or coffee / Instagram), especially in the morning

Some tasks feel very aversive (“I hate this”), and they don’t suddenly feel enjoyable

I can prioritize (as without medication already), but I’m trying to understand what it means to actually work according to priority on medication - is there a clear way to tell that I just hate a task or my ADHD prevents me from executing 

Current insight (I think?):

Medication doesn’t create motivation or enjoyment

It should reduce inner resistance and emotional overload, right?

I think for the first time in my life I don’t want to do things because of my personal preferences and aversion

What I’m still unsure about:

How do you tell the difference between „dose too low“ vs. „personal preference/aversion“?

Is it expected to still feel strong dislike for boring tasks, as long as starting them is possible?

How did you personally know your morning dose was „right”?

Would love to hear how others experienced this phase

1pre43a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1pre43a/realistic_dream_about_an_ex/,Realistic dream about an ex,"So I had a dream about an ex. Just woke up feeling angry about it. My dreams have been vivid for quite some time now and sometimes I wake up carrying my emotions from that dream still with me. Thought I just talk about this dream here. 

In my dream I kissed him. I was hopeful after that and he was being vague. However, somehow I'm still in his house wondering around and searching for him I have talks about random stuff with his ex that's somehow living in his house. I sleep in the same room with him and he sleeps next to his ex. I then wake up to see them kissing together. He acts kind of nonchalant about me seeing this. I feel betrayed and walk away in anger. 

He comes around to see me and says with a slight grin ""I think we should talk about this"". I first want to calm down and say to him ""let me first get myself a cup of coffee and I'll come and find you , because we defintely shóuld talk this!"" (it's not as Leam Neeson as it sounds). Then a friend of him comments ""I bet you saw him with Emily"". Then he starts to avoid me. I see random people hanging around and I ask about him. I say to them ""I'm searching for him one last time and after that I'm calling it quits"". """"That's kind of cool of you"" a girl that's tripping says to me. ""Well I don't think I'm that cool"" with a frown on my face. 

I'm internally ruminating  ""What is that cool about chasing after an emotionally avoidant dissapointing man or about giving up on it all together "". 

The last thing I remember is just having to give up on him without getting to do my caffeinated ""you've dissapointed me"" rant. I'm not cool, random tripping girI, I am caffeinated and catty. If I were him, I'd hide too ;). Atleast with coffee I can add some sugar and milk to deal with the bitterness. Feeling bitter about dissapointments from my past love life that show up in vivid symbolic dreams? Well, I have yet to find out how to deal with that. I have dreamt about another ex the same way a long time ago, roaming around in his house feeling intuitively I should move on and leave, yet still chasing something. I think there is some symbolism to it. 

This ex made a turn around emotionally for some very valid personal reasons. I was feeling dissapointed about it and angry. I guess after a long time it still comes back. I still stand by the fact that there's nothing cool about walking away and giving up on love because of resentment. And neither is chasing after some one that's chosing another woman while shrugging about it. Just go get a nice cup of coffee outside of his house, ask some extra whipped cream. Don't find yourself giving a lecture about how you should be treated. Just move on and don!'t take the bitterness with you to the next house you step into.

They hide dosages behind cool names like ""neuro matrix"".

In reality it was just cheap caffeine powder.

I was wired for an hour and then crashed harder than coffee.

One listed lion's mane but I realized later it was raw powder not extract.

They put just enough in to make the label look good but not enough to actually work.

I hate admitting this because I hate spending fifty dollars on a bottle.

I recently went through a breakup because my ex was depressed and got overwhelmed by the idea of a relationship (we’re basically the same person mentally, it was spooky how similar we were)

I’ve left her alone for a few weeks now, but I’ve been thinking about my own patterns and how I showed up in our relationship and it made me really sad because I realised I couldn’t accept any of her safety? 

She wanted to do nice things for me like bring soup when I was sick or keep my favourite snacks (which you can’t find where we live) stocked in her cupboards, and I nearly broke up with her, it just made me too uncomfortable! Every time we had a moment where she wanted me to be vulnerable, I’d skate over it or give her a fraction of the story. Literally every chance to be closer to her emotionally, I would choose to pull back, I could feel it in the moment and would brush it off with jokes or physical affection, but I feel like I’m only just seeing my own pattern clearly now that I’ve lost the comfort I felt when I was with her?

She was vulnerable though, she told me some really big things and she let me take care of her when she was sick, even though I know she felt the same way I did about receiving kindness. I know this isn’t WHY we broke up, but it sucks realising how much I pushed her away when I’ve spent so much of my life wishing that someone would be that nice to me. 

I’m going to text her when we’re both back from our holidays and give her the cliff notes of my realisation and see if she’s interested in getting coffee, but I feel like I ruined everything by not being brave enough to accept what she was giving me.

Hopefully she’ll accept, I think the worst bit about this is that because we were so similar I can’t help but feel that we could really help each other if we could just stay 😭",2,1766236188.0,FearfulAvoidants,1,1.0,False

1prdxu1,https://i.redd.it/dpn535m5yc8g1.png,BURIED WITH HER SECRETS,"Buried with Her Secrets
As memories surface and the past unravels, Rupert realizes too late that the woman he despised loved him beyond life itself.
But some truths arrive only when apologies can no longer be heard—and love has already been buried.

Chapter 1
After her death, his hatred lingered. He even spent 5 million dollars just to force her to show up and apologize.
It wasn't until he stood before her overgrown grave and saw the heirloom brooch from his own family resting there that the awful truth dawned on him.
Even after cutting him off with ""It was just a campus romance,"" she still sacrificed herself to secure his future.
And the baby he never knew she carried lay buried with her in the rolling highlands of Appalachia.
***
The private room of the upscale club buzzed with the clink of glasses and easy conversation.
""Rupert has to be the most successful of our graduating class, right?""
""Without a doubt. The Steele Group is massive now. I hear even candidates with PhDs struggle to get through their hiring process.""
""Fidelia must be sick with regret for dumping a catch like him.""
A brief, knowing silence fell over the group as everyone recalled the high school's most talked-about couple.
Fidelia Putnam had pursued Rupert Steele so openly that the whole school knew about it.
Yet at graduation, she was the one who ended it.
Someone broke the quiet. ""If Fidelia hadn't broken up with him, she'd be Mrs. Steele now, steeped in opulence and comfort.""
The moment the words were spoken, the door to the private room opened.
Rupert entered. Dressed in a charcoal suit with a silver-grey tie, he carried an aura of cool, untouchable authority.
""My apologies. The traffic was impossible.""
The group exchanged glances before rising to greet him.
""Mr. Steele, congratulations on your engagement to Ms. Wagner!""
""That 'Twilight' photography series you bought at the auction for 5 million dollars—incredible!""
""Do you think Fidelia regrets her decision now, seeing how far Mr. Steele's come?""
""Who knows? She might be perfectly happy. I saw a post of hers last month—she was in Iceland watching the northern lights.""
Rupert, who had just picked up his cup, glanced up. His expression remained unreadable as he took a sip. ""Really?""
The simple word made his complete indifference to Fidelia clear.
The atmosphere chilled momentarily.
Someone sensitive to the shift quickly changed the subject, and the conversation gradually resumed its flow.
Later in the evening, Rupert stepped out onto the terrace for air. He had just taken out a cigarette when his friend Jeffrey Garner approached.
Jeffrey looked at him with amused curiosity. ""What's this? The legendary workaholic at a class reunion?""
Rupert's reply was casual. ""They're still old classmates.""
With a knowing smile, Jeffrey said, ""That photography series you acquired was Fidelia's work, right?""
Rupert merely flicked his lighter open and closed, silent.
Jeffrey's next question was blunt. ""Rupert, it's been five years. Don't tell me you're still hung up on her.""
Rupert's gaze sharpened, cutting toward his friend. ""Don't be absurd. I bought it for the art. The artist is irrelevant.""
Jeffrey seemed relieved. ""Good. She wasn't worth your time.
""I'm going home. All that flattery is exhausting.""
Rupert stayed on the terrace, leaning against the railing. He lit a cigarette.
The smoke hazed the air, dimming the glow of the distant skyline.
Against his will, his mind replayed their final moments.
Fidelia's face, usually so gentle, had been set in cold resolve.
""It was never meant to be more than a campus romance, Rupert,"" she told him. ""Surely you understood that?
""The life you can offer isn't the one I want. There's no point in us holding each other back.
""Once we leave this place, let's just move on and never meet again!""
The words she had spoken that day had haunted him for years.
Rupert exhaled a stream of smoke, a faint, bitter smile touching his lips.
As the cigarette burned down to the filter, he crushed it out. His phone rang—it was his assistant, Esteban Brook.
""Mr. Steele, the transfer of ownership for the 'Twilight' series is complete.
""The exhibition organizers, to express their gratitude for your generosity, said they would honor one reasonable request.""
Rupert was silent for a moment before replying, his voice cool, ""Tell them I want the artist to deliver her thanks in person.""
Chapter 2
After ending the call, Rupert looked up to see the rain falling harder outside the window.
It suddenly reminded him of Fidelia, who once pulled him out in a torrential downpour to take pictures by the shore.
Though she had been drenched, her eyes had shone with exhilaration.
""You're the only person crazy enough to do this with me, Rupert. I love you!""
The rain intensified, its relentless patter against the glass feeding a growing, unexplainable irritation within him.
He released a heavy breath and sent a quick text to the class monitor, ""Had to leave early. Something came up.""
His driver was waiting at the entrance. Rupert got into the car and said flatly, ""Home.""
As the car navigated the rain-blurred streets, a familiar apartment building gradually came into view.
If Fidelia were still alive, she would have recognized it instantly that it was the complex they had rented during their university years.
Rupert was now the owner of the entire building.
He pushed the penthouse door open to find Lauretta Wagner, dressed in casual home clothes, walking out of the kitchen.
She handed him a mug. ""It's pouring out there. I made you this.""
He accepted it. The cloyingly sweet scent of hot chocolate hit him immediately, making him grimace.
Lauretta, who had worked hard to win him over, grew tense at his reaction.
""Is something wrong? I saw an old post of yours saying hot chocolate was perfect for rainy weather. I thought you liked it.""
Rupert didn't reply, feeling the familiar knot of frustration tighten in his chest.
He remembered that post.
Back in college, after a major project had fallen through, he'd come home drenched and defeated.
Fidelia had made him a mug of hot chocolate and insisted he drink it.
""You're going to be great, Rupert,"" she had said. ""Finish this and start fresh tomorrow.""
She always had a way of cutting through his gloom with a few simple words, restoring his confidence.
That night, he'd posted a picture of the empty mug with the caption: ""Rainy days and hot chocolate.""
Rupert closed his eyes briefly, then gently pushed the mug back toward Lauretta.
""I don't like it anymore. Please don't make it again.""
Lauretta hesitated, then nodded. ""Alright. Actually, I wanted to ask you something.
""I was thinking of turning the attic into a personal studio. Would that be okay?""
Rupert felt a sharp pang at the mention of the attic.
His grip tightened on his own glass.
The attic had been Fidelia's sanctuary. He hadn't set foot in it since purchasing the apartment.
He met Lauretta's gaze, his tone gentle. ""Of course. Do whatever you'd like with it. I'll arrange for workers tomorrow.""
Lauretta smiled warmly at him. ""Thank you, Rupert. You're wonderful.""
He gave a brief nod and moved toward the bedroom. ""You should get some sleep. I have paperwork to finish.""
Lauretta watched him walk away, a deep, possessive gleam in her eyes.
She whispered, ""Anything you could do, Fidelia, I can do, too.""
The next morning, when Rupert left the bedroom, Lauretta was already gone.
He looked at the silent house, then called Esteban.
""Send a design team over today. I want the attic renovated.""
After hanging up, he stared at the attic door. After a long pause, he found himself walking up the stairs, almost against his own will.
Inside, the walls were still dotted with faded photographs. In a corner lay discarded boxes from camera equipment, their labels bearing Fidelia's distinctive script.
Rupert's sharp eyes scanned every inch of the room.
This was where they had shared their ambitions, held each other close, whispered promises for the future...
All the memories he had fought to bury came rushing back, scalding him from the inside.
His hands clenched into fists. Suddenly, he snatched an old tripod from the corner and hurled it across the room with violent force.
The space was soon in chaos.
Then, a photo album tumbled open at his feet. The pictures inside were awkward, the compositions amateurish.
In the bottom corner of one photo, the name ""Delia"" was written over and over in dark ink.
It was his handwriting.
He had taken up photography back then, trying to step into her world.
When Fidelia found out, she laughed and wrapped her arms around him. ""When you've taken a thousand pictures of me, Rupert, I'll marry you. How does that sound?""
Then, when he reached nine hundred and ninety-nine, she ended everything.
Rupert gritted his teeth, his breath coming unevenly, his composure crumbling.
He bent to retrieve the album, and any warmth in his gaze faded, replaced by iciness.
With a click, a flame sprang from his lighter, catching the edge of the album's pages. It burned, consuming the final, fragile threads of sentiment he had clung to.
""I'll be here when you decide to face me, Fidelia,"" he said. ""We'll settle this then.""
The charred album fell to the floor with a dull, heavy thud—a sound like a long-delayed goodbye.
Chapter 3
Rupert straightened up, taking a deep breath to quell the restless agitation churning in his chest.
He gave one last look at the devastated attic before turning away, heading downstairs, grabbing his car keys, and driving straight to the office.
As he approached his office door, he saw Esteban directing a small team carefully moving a large item shrouded in a protective cloth.
Rupert's casual glance happened to catch a corner of the cloth slipping away, revealing a glimpse of a distinctive, cool-toned image. His eyes narrowed instantly.
""What is this?"" he asked coldly.
Esteban turned, quickly explaining, ""Mr. Steele, this is the original 'Twilight' series. The exhibition organizers just delivered it.""
Rupert's gaze swept over the photographs, his expression icy. ""Have it sent directly to the old storage warehouse up north.""
Esteban looked surprised, wondering, ""If he didn't like it, why bid a fortune? And if he did, why treat it like trash?""
He didn't dare ask. ""Understood, sir. I'll arrange it immediately.""
Rupert said nothing more. He walked into his office and sat down, opening a file on his desk.
For a long while, he couldn't absorb a single word.
Soon, Esteban returned, having just hung up, and delivered his report with deference.
""Mr. Steele, the organizers have replied. They're currently unable to reach the photographer.""
Rupert didn't look up, his voice indifferent. ""That's their problem to solve.""
Esteban understood immediately—Rupert was insisting they fulfill his demand.
After a moment's hesitation, Esteban added, ""I'll maintain contact with them.
""Though they mentioned that when the photographer consigned the work years ago, she seemed to be in poor health. They aren't certain they can locate her.""
Rupert's head snapped up, his sharp look making Esteban tense.
But then, Fidelia's once-mocking words echoed in his mind.
""Some so-called artists love to spin tales of tragic illness—a cheap trick to drive up prices and fleece gullible collectors.""
His expression grew even colder, a derisive smile touching his lips. ""It seems Fidelia has become the very type of person she used to despise.""
He picked up the file again, instructing his assistant, ""Tell the organizers: I either meet the artist in person, or I return the collection.""
The charity exhibition had already ended. A high-profile return would be a severe blow to their reputation.
Seeing Rupert's unyielding demeanor, Esteban could only nod in agreement.
Rupert didn't leave the office until after nightfall.
Arriving home, he pushed the apartment door open and heard noises coming from the attic.
He followed the sound. Seeing Lauretta bustling about inside, he frowned. ""You should leave this to the workers.""
Startled, Lauretta turned. A gentle smile spread across her face when she saw him.
""It's not the same. This will be my creative sanctuary,"" she said sweetly.
Rupert fell silent, his eyes taking in the now-unrecognizable space. A strong sense of unfamiliarity washed over him.
Noticing the sudden quiet, Lauretta glanced at him, a subtle shift in her gaze. ""What is it?"" she murmured. ""Does the layout not work for you?""
He pressed his lips together, then shook his head. ""No. If you like it, that's what matters.""
Lauretta smiled, adjusting a new wind chime by the window before changing the subject.
""Rupe, my parents called today. They were wondering when we might be free to come over for a family dinner.""
Rupert paused, meeting her expectant gaze. Without hesitation, he said, ""This Sunday works.""
He then added, ""What do they like? I'll prepare some gifts.""
""Don't bother with a gift,"" Lauretta said, waving a hand. ""Just you coming is more than enough.""
Looking at the handsome, composed man before her, she couldn't help but step forward and wrap her arms around him.
As her hair brushed against his jaw, Rupert's shoulders tensed almost imperceptibly for an instant.
But he relaxed quickly, returning the hug briefly before pulling out his phone to call Esteban.
""Clear my schedule for this Sunday.""
There was a slight hesitation on the other end.
""Sir, the organizers just contacted us. The photographer, Starlight, has agreed to meet with you.
""They've scheduled the meeting for Sunday.""
Chapter 4
Hearing this, Rupert looked down at Lauretta in his arms. His voice remained flat. ""Tell them to reschedule.""
Before he could continue, Lauretta gently interjected, ""Rupe, it's just a family dinner. It shouldn't conflict.""
He tightened his grip on the phone. ""Nothing is more important than you.""
Lauretta gave a soft, understanding smile. ""But I don't want to interfere with your important business.""
Only then did Rupert speak into the phone again. ""Set the meeting for Sunday at 2 PM.""
After hanging up, he said directly to Lauretta, ""I'll change, then we can go to the mall to pick out gifts for your parents.""
Lauretta agreed sweetly. Once he left, she surveyed the newly transformed attic, a cold glint flashing in her eyes.
""Fidelia, why can't you just stay gone?""
Sunday arrived.
After finishing some work, Rupert headed to the coffee shop where he was to meet the photographer, Starlight.
Pushing the door open, he spotted a woman with her back to him, seated at a table by the window.
He strode over. ""Fidelia...""
But the words died on his lips as he saw the woman's face. His brows drew together. ""Camilla? What are you doing here?""
Camilla Gilmore looked at him with no expression. ""It's been years since you and Delia split. Why do you need to see her now?""
Rupert's eyes narrowed. Camilla had vehemently opposed their relationship back then and had never had a kind word for him.
Even now, years later, her attitude hadn't changed.
He took a seat opposite her, his voice low. ""You're in no position to question me. Let Fidelia speak for herself.""
""She can't come,"" Camilla stated calmly.
A sarcastic smile touched Rupert's lips. ""Really? 5 million dollars isn't enough to lure her out? Does she think that highly of herself?""
The words seemed to strike a nerve. Camilla's voice rose slightly. ""Rupert! Fidelia is dead.""
Rupert let out a derisive laugh. ""Dead? So you're in on this little performance too, I see.""
His patience gone, he stood up coldly.
""I'll release the final payment when I see her in person. Otherwise, Fidelia won't get a cent.""
He walked out of the coffee shop, got into his car, and, seeing Camilla hurry out after him, he hit the accelerator without a second glance.
He'd see just how long Fidelia could keep up this act.
That evening, Rupert accompanied Lauretta to her family home as planned.
When he saw the elegant, middle-aged man on the living room sofa, he froze.
Fidelia had once shown him a faded photograph, saying quietly, ""This is my father.
""But he left my mother and me. He started a new family. We haven't been in contact since.""
And the man from that photograph was sitting right there—Lauretta's father.
Ayden Wagner smiled warmly. ""You must be Rupe. Please, have a seat.""
As Rupert sat down, Ayden continued, ""Laura is my only daughter. You must take good care of her.""
Lauretta smiled adoringly. ""Dad, Rupe treats me very well.""
Her father pointed at her affectionately, a picture of paternal warmth and family harmony.
But Rupert's attention was drawn to his surroundings.
The walls were covered with annual family portraits of Lauretta from childhood to adulthood.
Her room was a carefully curated music studio, with an expensive piano adorned with delicate figurines.
He remembered Fidelia telling him how, after her parents' divorce, she and her mother had shuffled between relatives' homes.
Eventually, when no one would take them in, they had even taken shelter in an abandoned factory dormitory...
Rupert glanced at Ayden, a faint, almost imperceptible frown touching his brow.
After dinner, Rupert took his leave.
Back in his car, as he gazed into the deep night, Camilla's words—""She's dead""—echoed inexplicably in his ears.
He was silent for a moment, then took out his phone and opened a chat with the class monitor.
""You mentioned last time Fidelia was abroad?""
The reply came quickly, ""Yeah, her social media showed a location in Iceland.""
A screenshot followed.
In it, Fidelia stood under the aurora borealis in a white dress, her smile as radiant as ever.
Beside her stood a tall, unfamiliar man, his hand resting casually on her shoulder in an intimate pose.
The date stamp in the corner read: August 20th, less than a month ago.
A sudden, nameless fury shot through Rupert.
""Less than a month... How could a perfectly healthy person just die?"" he wondered.
He immediately called his assistant, his voice icy.
""I want to know exactly where Fidelia is right now. You have three days.""
Chapter 5
After the call was ended, his phone screen lit up with a message from Lauretta.
""Rupe, my parents loved you! They can't stop asking when we're planning the wedding.""
Rupert looked at the message and was about to reply when another message from her popped up.
""They mentioned that my side of the family isn't very large, so the guest list will mostly depend on yours.""
""Oh, my father had a daughter from a relationship before he married my mom, but they lost contact years ago. I hope you don't mind?""
""If you'd prefer a larger gathering, I could try to reach out to her.""
Rupert typed a reply, ""Unnecessary. Our affairs have nothing to do with outsiders.""
""You're right. My dad mentioned she moved abroad with her boyfriend. Best not to disturb her.""
Rupert's gaze lingered on the words ""her boyfriend"". His expression grew even more scornful.
The next day, Rupert had barely arrived at his office when his desk phone rang.
""Mr. Steele, Camilla Gilmore in the lobby insists on seeing you.""
Rupert tapped his fingers twice on the polished desk, a cold glint in his eyes.
""She's only pushing this hard to make the whole 'Fidelia's dead' con more convincing. That final payout is the real goal,"" he wondered.
His reply was curt. ""Not happening.""
Rupert didn't expect Camilla to wait outside the building for him all day.
As he left at the end of the workday, she rushed toward him, her face etched with exhaustion and urgency. ""Rupert, when will the final payment for the 'Twilight' series be released?""
His voice was icy. ""The money will be transferred when Fidelia comes to thank me in person.
""If she can't, don't expect to get her hands on that money and live large.""
Camilla stared at him in disbelief. ""You think Delia wanted that money for herself?""
Her mouth twisted, her eyes reddening. ""Rupert, she's really gone.
""She had a donation agreement drawn up before she died. The entire sum from the sale was designated for the Appalachia Children's Education Fund.
""The repairs for multiple school buildings are contingent on that money. The children's classrooms depend on it. If you're not going to honor it, release the claim immediately so I can find another buyer.""
Rupert's tone remained flat. ""Starting with the emotional blackmail now, are you?
""Let me be clear: unless Fidelia shows up herself, I will withhold that payment indefinitely.""
With that, he strode toward the black sedan waiting at the curb. ""Drive.""
As the car pulled away, Rupert watched Camilla's helpless figure standing alone in the rearview mirror, an inexplicable sense of irritation knotting in his chest.
When he snapped out of it, he found himself unconsciously searching for ""Appalachia Children's Education Fund"" on his phone.
Scanning the list of donations on the screen, he felt like he was losing his mind.
He closed his eyes briefly, his finger scrolling down the long donor list.
Then his gaze stopped abruptly.
Toward the end of the list, one entry was clearly marked: Donor: Starlight.
Rupert frowned, thinking, ""So Fidelia really was involved in charity work?""
Remembering Camilla's repeated insistence that Fidelia was dead, he pressed his lips together and instructed Esteban in the front seat.
""Find a way to track Fidelia's movements in recent years. And her medical records.""
""Yes, sir.""
When the car arrived at the apartment building, Rupert ran into Lauretta, who was on her way out.
He looked at the woman in a hurry, his tone mild. ""Is something wrong? You seem rushed.""
Lauretta's expression was troubled. ""There's an issue with a few of my photographs on consignment at the art center.
""I publicly promised that all proceeds from those specific pieces would go to charity.
""But the center discovered that another artist has copied my donation data and is claiming it as her own.
""Now my supporters are questioning the authenticity of my pledges. I have to go handle this personally.""
Rupert frowned as well, pulling out his phone. ""Did you find out who it is? I'll have my legal department assist you.""
Lauretta lowered her eyes and slowly uttered, ""Starlight.""
Rupert's expression darkened instantly.
Chapter 6
That evening, a legal notice was dispatched from the Steele Group, addressed directly to Starlight's studio.
""Photographer Starlight is hereby requested to provide a reasonable explanation within three days regarding the alleged misappropriation of donation data. Failure to comply will result in immediate legal action by the Steele Group legal department.""
The Steele Group's statement quickly gained traction online. The topics ""The Steele Group's rights"" and ""Starlight's fraud"" started trending.
The earlier sale of a photographic series for 5 million dollars had already brought Fidelia significant attention.
This new development caused an uproar.
""She built her whole image on charity, using her kindness as a ploy for pity? Did Starlight think we were all that gullible?""
""How dare she use money meant for children's education to boost her reputation and her prices? Her character is rotten to the core!""
""We must boycott her work! A disgrace like this should be banned from the industry for good!""
Soon, the social media accounts linked to Fidelia's studio were flooded with a torrent of condemnation.
Rupert scrolled through his phone screen, his eyes revealing no emotion.
With the situation escalating to this point, he didn't believe Fidelia could hold her ground much longer.
Yet, despite the public outcry, Fidelia's studio remained silent, allowing the storm to intensify.
A gossip blogger dug up the old story of Fidelia aggressively pursuing Rupert back then.
""Once schemed to climb the social ladder with Mr. Steele, only to lose her golden ticket due to short-sightedness. Now she's moved on to charity fraud.""
Reporters contacted the fund for a statement, but the staff declined to comment. This silence was widely interpreted as an admission of guilt.
Eventually, over a dozen collectors who owned Fidelia's work issued a joint statement demanding refunds.
What followed was an overwhelming surge of condemnation that buried Fidelia's reputation and her studio's credibility.
Late that night, the studio finally issued its first response.
""Gathering evidence takes time. But the proceeds from Starlight's sales have long since been transformed into new school buildings for the children of Appalachia.""
The statement included nine images: clear bank transfer records, screenshots of the donation agreement, and photos of several newly built, simple schoolhouses.
A finance professional commented: ""Judging from the transaction records, these transfers appear to be legitimate.""
But skepticism persisted.
""Even deducting the 5 million dollars from 'Twilight', Starlight has earned nearly 1.6 million dollars from other sales. How much of that was actually donated? This is still fraud.""
This comment was pushed to the top.
Throughout it all, Fidelia herself never said anything.
Rupert watched coldly as the controversy raged on, a faint, cold smile playing on his lips.
He had expected Fidelia to cave within twenty-four hours, but a full day and night passed with no sign of her.
His phone screen suddenly lit up. Rupert absently swiped it open, then froze.
The studio had issued a second statement. This time, it contained only one image.
It was a death certificate. The bright red official seal looked stark and jarring on the screen.
""This is to certify that Fidelia Putnam passed away on September 10, 2024, due to illness after failed resuscitation...""
The certificate caused a new wave of shock.
A different tone began to emerge in the comments.
""Fidelia is really dead? Could the fraud allegations be a misunderstanding?""
""The timeline shows she was already gone before the 'Twilight' series was sold. What would she gain from fraud now?""
Rupert stared at the death certificate, finding it utterly absurd.
After a moment's thought, he directly posted the screenshot of Fidelia's Icelandic social media post—the one the class monitor had sent—onto his own verified account.
He captioned it with just one line: ""What exactly is your illness, Fidelia?""
In the photo, Fidelia looked vibrant, her smile radiant, showing no trace of terminal illness.
Feeling a slight, grim satisfaction, Rupert tossed his phone aside and paid it no further mind.
Just then, Lauretta walked over with a fruit platter. ""Rupe, I'm so sorry for causing all this trouble for you.""
He shook his head. ""What matters to you, matters to me.""
She smiled at him. ""Oh, my parents were asking about our engagement plans...""
Rupert paused. ""There's no rush. Let's wait until this matter is fully resolved and your name is cleared.""
Lauretta masked a flash of impatience in her eyes and nodded obediently. ""Alright.""
She turned to leave but added over her shoulder, ""Then please don't delay, Rupe. My parents have already begun making preparations for our wedding.""
The mention of a wedding hit a nerve, making Rupert's expression tighten.
He remembered his mother, before her death, giving Fidelia a family heirloom—an emerald brooch.
His mother had said it was a token for her future daughter-in-law.
Rupert pressed his lips into a tight line, forcibly suppressing the memories surging in his mind.
He spent a sleepless night.
The next morning, as soon as Rupert arrived at the office, he saw a pale Camilla waiting for him, her eyes bloodshot.
Rupert pinched the bridge of his nose and said to security, ""Please escort her out. I don't want to see her near the building again.""
Restrained by security, Camilla stared at him in disbelief, her voice hoarse. ""Rupert, Delia poured her soul into every photograph. Why go this far?""
Rupert's steps halted briefly. His voice held no emotion. ""What does that have to do with me?
""Oh, tell Fidelia to return my mother's brooch. She has no right to keep it.""
As he turned to walk away, Camilla shouted after him, her voice sharp, ""Rupert, you want to know where Fidelia is, don't you?
""The coordinates are -83.5° West, 35.6° North.
""It's in a remote part of Appalachia. Go find her yourself!""
Chapter 7
Camilla's hoarse, desperate shout struck Rupert as nothing more than a pathetic performance.
His expression cold, he walked toward the elevator, throwing a command over his shoulder to security. ""Make sure she doesn't cause any more disruptions.""
Back in his office, Rupert picked up a file, but his concentration was shattered.
Almost against his will, he typed the coordinates Camilla had given into the mapping software on his computer.
After a moment, the screen loaded, pinpointing a location deep within the remote, rolling mountains of Appalachia—a landscape of endless green interspersed with stretches of barren land.
Rupert stared at the blinking red dot, his fingers tightening slightly on the mouse. He closed the window, trying to dismiss the strange unease settling in his chest.
Not long after, Esteban knocked and entered.
""Mr. Steele, media crews were waiting outside. They filmed what happened at the front of the building.""
Rupert's eyes sharpened. ""Why were they there?""
""Another part of Fidelia's scheme?"" he wondered.
Esteban looked tense. ""With the allegations about Ms. Wagner's donation data, several outlets have been monitoring our company's movements.""
Rupert's face darkened.
Esteban pressed on. ""Now, many people are commenting on our official social media, demanding we go to Appalachia to verify the truth.
""In addition, the documentary series Fact Finders contacted us proactively. They expressed willingness to supply a crew and join you for a full, verified recording of the journey.""
Rupert's lips pressed into a thin line.
Fact Finders was known for its rigorous, objective reporting. They didn't engage in sensationalism, only reporting verified facts.
The situation had escalated beyond containment. If he refused to go now, public sentiment could easily turn, accusing the Steele Group of evasion, which would harm both reputation and stock value.
He pinched the bridge of his nose, a flicker of derision in his eyes. ""Fine. Have PR draft a statement.""
If this was her plan, he'd meet her challenge head-on.
That afternoon, the Steele Group's official account posted an update.
""We have agreed to partner with Fact Finders for a documented journey to Appalachia, departing tomorrow, to seek clarity on recent allegations.""
The waiting public responded swiftly.
""Glad Mr. Steele is taking action. We want the truth!""
""No one should be able to hide behind a story of being 'dead'!""
""With Fact Finders involved, this is legit.""
Fidelia's studio remained silent.
The following day, filming commenced. The live stream went live, and viewer numbers climbed rapidly into the tens of thousands.
Comments flew by.
""Mr. Steele moves really fast!""
""A full documentary trek? This is serious.""
Rupert glanced at the feed, then closed his eyes, pretending to rest.
After days of travel, the convoy, led by a local guide, finally wound its way into the remote Appalachian coordinates.
The camera captured the view: rough, unpaved roads and simple wooden homes dotting the hillsides—a world away from the city's bustle.
In the car, Rupert's throat moved slightly.
This isolated, austere place bore no resemblance to any scenario where Fidelia might be living lavishly.
The documentary producer spoke from the back seat. ""Mr. Steele, the building ahead appears to be one of the schools supported by the education fund. Should we stop?""
Before Rupert could reply, their local guide turned around, a warm, weathered smile on his face.
""If you're after Ms. Putnam, you've found her place.
""Kids around here got a chance to learn thanks to her.
""Honestly, half the county owes her a debt.""
The guide's words were like a small, sharp splinter, working its way under Rupert's skin.
The live chat erupted.
""This has to be a setup! A hired actor!""
""Some random guide just knows her? Too absurd!""
""Take us to the school,"" Rupert said, his voice cool.
The vehicle soon stopped in front of a simple building with a hand-painted wooden sign: Fidelia Putnam Elementary School. The group followed the guide inside.
Several kids wearing patched-up clothes were hunched over pristine new desks, carefully forming letters.
A small girl ran up, clutching a pencil stub. She looked at the guide and asked, ""Did they bring the new books, sir? Ms. Putnam told us once the new books come, we can finally stop using the ground for our lessons.""
For a moment, Rupert, the crew, and the live stream fell completely silent.
Then a comment drifted past.
""If she's using these kids for sympathy, that's low.""
The guide spoke gently to the child, then turned to the group.
""She's up there,"" the guide said, pointing. ""On the pine ridge behind the school. You can't miss it.""
Rupert said nothing. The chat, however, grew active again.
""Here we go! Expose the fraud, Mr. Steele!""
""Using kids as props, she's heartless.""
Rupert's eyes skimmed the comments. Without a word, he turned and walked back to the vehicle.
The mountain air held a damp chill. When they reached the pine-covered ridge, the place was quiet, filled only with the sound of wind through the trees.
Skepticism flooded the stream.
""Seriously? Not a single person. Are they just wasting our time?""
""This looks completely deserted.""
Rupert frowned. Then, a faint, familiar glint caught his eye from further up the slope.
He looked up. Among the pine boughs, something seemed to catch the light.
An odd tightness gripped his chest.
The next moment, he was striding up the hill, the cameraman hurrying to follow.
As he climbed, the soft ground gave way beneath him, and the swish of the pine trees rose steadily around him.
Finally, Rupert reached the top of the ridge.
A simple grave, outlined with gathered stones, lay before him.
Around it were patterns made of sticks and bundles of dried wildflowers.
At its head stood a weathered wooden marker.
Fixed to a simple pine branch leaning against it was the emerald brooch.
The marker bore four deeply carved words: Fidelia Putnam. Rest Here.
The wind swept through the pines with a sound like a slow, endless sigh. Rupert stood utterly still, his mind blank.
On the live stream, the comments exploded. ",1,1766236051.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1prdw8d,https://i.redd.it/dpn535m5yc8g1.png,BURIED WITH HER SECRETS,"Buried with Her Secrets
As memories surface and the past unravels, Rupert realizes too late that the woman he despised loved him beyond life itself.
But some truths arrive only when apologies can no longer be heard—and love has already been buried.

Chapter 1
After her death, his hatred lingered. He even spent 5 million dollars just to force her to show up and apologize.
It wasn't until he stood before her overgrown grave and saw the heirloom brooch from his own family resting there that the awful truth dawned on him.
Even after cutting him off with ""It was just a campus romance,"" she still sacrificed herself to secure his future.
And the baby he never knew she carried lay buried with her in the rolling highlands of Appalachia.
***
The private room of the upscale club buzzed with the clink of glasses and easy conversation.
""Rupert has to be the most successful of our graduating class, right?""
""Without a doubt. The Steele Group is massive now. I hear even candidates with PhDs struggle to get through their hiring process.""
""Fidelia must be sick with regret for dumping a catch like him.""
A brief, knowing silence fell over the group as everyone recalled the high school's most talked-about couple.
Fidelia Putnam had pursued Rupert Steele so openly that the whole school knew about it.
Yet at graduation, she was the one who ended it.
Someone broke the quiet. ""If Fidelia hadn't broken up with him, she'd be Mrs. Steele now, steeped in opulence and comfort.""
The moment the words were spoken, the door to the private room opened.
Rupert entered. Dressed in a charcoal suit with a silver-grey tie, he carried an aura of cool, untouchable authority.
""My apologies. The traffic was impossible.""
The group exchanged glances before rising to greet him.
""Mr. Steele, congratulations on your engagement to Ms. Wagner!""
""That 'Twilight' photography series you bought at the auction for 5 million dollars—incredible!""
""Do you think Fidelia regrets her decision now, seeing how far Mr. Steele's come?""
""Who knows? She might be perfectly happy. I saw a post of hers last month—she was in Iceland watching the northern lights.""
Rupert, who had just picked up his cup, glanced up. His expression remained unreadable as he took a sip. ""Really?""
The simple word made his complete indifference to Fidelia clear.
The atmosphere chilled momentarily.
Someone sensitive to the shift quickly changed the subject, and the conversation gradually resumed its flow.
Later in the evening, Rupert stepped out onto the terrace for air. He had just taken out a cigarette when his friend Jeffrey Garner approached.
Jeffrey looked at him with amused curiosity. ""What's this? The legendary workaholic at a class reunion?""
Rupert's reply was casual. ""They're still old classmates.""
With a knowing smile, Jeffrey said, ""That photography series you acquired was Fidelia's work, right?""
Rupert merely flicked his lighter open and closed, silent.
Jeffrey's next question was blunt. ""Rupert, it's been five years. Don't tell me you're still hung up on her.""
Rupert's gaze sharpened, cutting toward his friend. ""Don't be absurd. I bought it for the art. The artist is irrelevant.""
Jeffrey seemed relieved. ""Good. She wasn't worth your time.
""I'm going home. All that flattery is exhausting.""
Rupert stayed on the terrace, leaning against the railing. He lit a cigarette.
The smoke hazed the air, dimming the glow of the distant skyline.
Against his will, his mind replayed their final moments.
Fidelia's face, usually so gentle, had been set in cold resolve.
""It was never meant to be more than a campus romance, Rupert,"" she told him. ""Surely you understood that?
""The life you can offer isn't the one I want. There's no point in us holding each other back.
""Once we leave this place, let's just move on and never meet again!""
The words she had spoken that day had haunted him for years.
Rupert exhaled a stream of smoke, a faint, bitter smile touching his lips.
As the cigarette burned down to the filter, he crushed it out. His phone rang—it was his assistant, Esteban Brook.
""Mr. Steele, the transfer of ownership for the 'Twilight' series is complete.
""The exhibition organizers, to express their gratitude for your generosity, said they would honor one reasonable request.""
Rupert was silent for a moment before replying, his voice cool, ""Tell them I want the artist to deliver her thanks in person.""
Chapter 2
After ending the call, Rupert looked up to see the rain falling harder outside the window.
It suddenly reminded him of Fidelia, who once pulled him out in a torrential downpour to take pictures by the shore.
Though she had been drenched, her eyes had shone with exhilaration.
""You're the only person crazy enough to do this with me, Rupert. I love you!""
The rain intensified, its relentless patter against the glass feeding a growing, unexplainable irritation within him.
He released a heavy breath and sent a quick text to the class monitor, ""Had to leave early. Something came up.""
His driver was waiting at the entrance. Rupert got into the car and said flatly, ""Home.""
As the car navigated the rain-blurred streets, a familiar apartment building gradually came into view.
If Fidelia were still alive, she would have recognized it instantly that it was the complex they had rented during their university years.
Rupert was now the owner of the entire building.
He pushed the penthouse door open to find Lauretta Wagner, dressed in casual home clothes, walking out of the kitchen.
She handed him a mug. ""It's pouring out there. I made you this.""
He accepted it. The cloyingly sweet scent of hot chocolate hit him immediately, making him grimace.
Lauretta, who had worked hard to win him over, grew tense at his reaction.
""Is something wrong? I saw an old post of yours saying hot chocolate was perfect for rainy weather. I thought you liked it.""
Rupert didn't reply, feeling the familiar knot of frustration tighten in his chest.
He remembered that post.
Back in college, after a major project had fallen through, he'd come home drenched and defeated.
Fidelia had made him a mug of hot chocolate and insisted he drink it.
""You're going to be great, Rupert,"" she had said. ""Finish this and start fresh tomorrow.""
She always had a way of cutting through his gloom with a few simple words, restoring his confidence.
That night, he'd posted a picture of the empty mug with the caption: ""Rainy days and hot chocolate.""
Rupert closed his eyes briefly, then gently pushed the mug back toward Lauretta.
""I don't like it anymore. Please don't make it again.""
Lauretta hesitated, then nodded. ""Alright. Actually, I wanted to ask you something.
""I was thinking of turning the attic into a personal studio. Would that be okay?""
Rupert felt a sharp pang at the mention of the attic.
His grip tightened on his own glass.
The attic had been Fidelia's sanctuary. He hadn't set foot in it since purchasing the apartment.
He met Lauretta's gaze, his tone gentle. ""Of course. Do whatever you'd like with it. I'll arrange for workers tomorrow.""
Lauretta smiled warmly at him. ""Thank you, Rupert. You're wonderful.""
He gave a brief nod and moved toward the bedroom. ""You should get some sleep. I have paperwork to finish.""
Lauretta watched him walk away, a deep, possessive gleam in her eyes.
She whispered, ""Anything you could do, Fidelia, I can do, too.""
The next morning, when Rupert left the bedroom, Lauretta was already gone.
He looked at the silent house, then called Esteban.
""Send a design team over today. I want the attic renovated.""
After hanging up, he stared at the attic door. After a long pause, he found himself walking up the stairs, almost against his own will.
Inside, the walls were still dotted with faded photographs. In a corner lay discarded boxes from camera equipment, their labels bearing Fidelia's distinctive script.
Rupert's sharp eyes scanned every inch of the room.
This was where they had shared their ambitions, held each other close, whispered promises for the future...
All the memories he had fought to bury came rushing back, scalding him from the inside.
His hands clenched into fists. Suddenly, he snatched an old tripod from the corner and hurled it across the room with violent force.
The space was soon in chaos.
Then, a photo album tumbled open at his feet. The pictures inside were awkward, the compositions amateurish.
In the bottom corner of one photo, the name ""Delia"" was written over and over in dark ink.
It was his handwriting.
He had taken up photography back then, trying to step into her world.
When Fidelia found out, she laughed and wrapped her arms around him. ""When you've taken a thousand pictures of me, Rupert, I'll marry you. How does that sound?""
Then, when he reached nine hundred and ninety-nine, she ended everything.
Rupert gritted his teeth, his breath coming unevenly, his composure crumbling.
He bent to retrieve the album, and any warmth in his gaze faded, replaced by iciness.
With a click, a flame sprang from his lighter, catching the edge of the album's pages. It burned, consuming the final, fragile threads of sentiment he had clung to.
""I'll be here when you decide to face me, Fidelia,"" he said. ""We'll settle this then.""
The charred album fell to the floor with a dull, heavy thud—a sound like a long-delayed goodbye.
Chapter 3
Rupert straightened up, taking a deep breath to quell the restless agitation churning in his chest.
He gave one last look at the devastated attic before turning away, heading downstairs, grabbing his car keys, and driving straight to the office.
As he approached his office door, he saw Esteban directing a small team carefully moving a large item shrouded in a protective cloth.
Rupert's casual glance happened to catch a corner of the cloth slipping away, revealing a glimpse of a distinctive, cool-toned image. His eyes narrowed instantly.
""What is this?"" he asked coldly.
Esteban turned, quickly explaining, ""Mr. Steele, this is the original 'Twilight' series. The exhibition organizers just delivered it.""
Rupert's gaze swept over the photographs, his expression icy. ""Have it sent directly to the old storage warehouse up north.""
Esteban looked surprised, wondering, ""If he didn't like it, why bid a fortune? And if he did, why treat it like trash?""
He didn't dare ask. ""Understood, sir. I'll arrange it immediately.""
Rupert said nothing more. He walked into his office and sat down, opening a file on his desk.
For a long while, he couldn't absorb a single word.
Soon, Esteban returned, having just hung up, and delivered his report with deference.
""Mr. Steele, the organizers have replied. They're currently unable to reach the photographer.""
Rupert didn't look up, his voice indifferent. ""That's their problem to solve.""
Esteban understood immediately—Rupert was insisting they fulfill his demand.
After a moment's hesitation, Esteban added, ""I'll maintain contact with them.
""Though they mentioned that when the photographer consigned the work years ago, she seemed to be in poor health. They aren't certain they can locate her.""
Rupert's head snapped up, his sharp look making Esteban tense.
But then, Fidelia's once-mocking words echoed in his mind.
""Some so-called artists love to spin tales of tragic illness—a cheap trick to drive up prices and fleece gullible collectors.""
His expression grew even colder, a derisive smile touching his lips. ""It seems Fidelia has become the very type of person she used to despise.""
He picked up the file again, instructing his assistant, ""Tell the organizers: I either meet the artist in person, or I return the collection.""
The charity exhibition had already ended. A high-profile return would be a severe blow to their reputation.
Seeing Rupert's unyielding demeanor, Esteban could only nod in agreement.
Rupert didn't leave the office until after nightfall.
Arriving home, he pushed the apartment door open and heard noises coming from the attic.
He followed the sound. Seeing Lauretta bustling about inside, he frowned. ""You should leave this to the workers.""
Startled, Lauretta turned. A gentle smile spread across her face when she saw him.
""It's not the same. This will be my creative sanctuary,"" she said sweetly.
Rupert fell silent, his eyes taking in the now-unrecognizable space. A strong sense of unfamiliarity washed over him.
Noticing the sudden quiet, Lauretta glanced at him, a subtle shift in her gaze. ""What is it?"" she murmured. ""Does the layout not work for you?""
He pressed his lips together, then shook his head. ""No. If you like it, that's what matters.""
Lauretta smiled, adjusting a new wind chime by the window before changing the subject.
""Rupe, my parents called today. They were wondering when we might be free to come over for a family dinner.""
Rupert paused, meeting her expectant gaze. Without hesitation, he said, ""This Sunday works.""
He then added, ""What do they like? I'll prepare some gifts.""
""Don't bother with a gift,"" Lauretta said, waving a hand. ""Just you coming is more than enough.""
Looking at the handsome, composed man before her, she couldn't help but step forward and wrap her arms around him.
As her hair brushed against his jaw, Rupert's shoulders tensed almost imperceptibly for an instant.
But he relaxed quickly, returning the hug briefly before pulling out his phone to call Esteban.
""Clear my schedule for this Sunday.""
There was a slight hesitation on the other end.
""Sir, the organizers just contacted us. The photographer, Starlight, has agreed to meet with you.
""They've scheduled the meeting for Sunday.""
Chapter 4
Hearing this, Rupert looked down at Lauretta in his arms. His voice remained flat. ""Tell them to reschedule.""
Before he could continue, Lauretta gently interjected, ""Rupe, it's just a family dinner. It shouldn't conflict.""
He tightened his grip on the phone. ""Nothing is more important than you.""
Lauretta gave a soft, understanding smile. ""But I don't want to interfere with your important business.""
Only then did Rupert speak into the phone again. ""Set the meeting for Sunday at 2 PM.""
After hanging up, he said directly to Lauretta, ""I'll change, then we can go to the mall to pick out gifts for your parents.""
Lauretta agreed sweetly. Once he left, she surveyed the newly transformed attic, a cold glint flashing in her eyes.
""Fidelia, why can't you just stay gone?""
Sunday arrived.
After finishing some work, Rupert headed to the coffee shop where he was to meet the photographer, Starlight.
Pushing the door open, he spotted a woman with her back to him, seated at a table by the window.
He strode over. ""Fidelia...""
But the words died on his lips as he saw the woman's face. His brows drew together. ""Camilla? What are you doing here?""
Camilla Gilmore looked at him with no expression. ""It's been years since you and Delia split. Why do you need to see her now?""
Rupert's eyes narrowed. Camilla had vehemently opposed their relationship back then and had never had a kind word for him.
Even now, years later, her attitude hadn't changed.
He took a seat opposite her, his voice low. ""You're in no position to question me. Let Fidelia speak for herself.""
""She can't come,"" Camilla stated calmly.
A sarcastic smile touched Rupert's lips. ""Really? 5 million dollars isn't enough to lure her out? Does she think that highly of herself?""
The words seemed to strike a nerve. Camilla's voice rose slightly. ""Rupert! Fidelia is dead.""
Rupert let out a derisive laugh. ""Dead? So you're in on this little performance too, I see.""
His patience gone, he stood up coldly.
""I'll release the final payment when I see her in person. Otherwise, Fidelia won't get a cent.""
He walked out of the coffee shop, got into his car, and, seeing Camilla hurry out after him, he hit the accelerator without a second glance.
He'd see just how long Fidelia could keep up this act.
That evening, Rupert accompanied Lauretta to her family home as planned.
When he saw the elegant, middle-aged man on the living room sofa, he froze.
Fidelia had once shown him a faded photograph, saying quietly, ""This is my father.
""But he left my mother and me. He started a new family. We haven't been in contact since.""
And the man from that photograph was sitting right there—Lauretta's father.
Ayden Wagner smiled warmly. ""You must be Rupe. Please, have a seat.""
As Rupert sat down, Ayden continued, ""Laura is my only daughter. You must take good care of her.""
Lauretta smiled adoringly. ""Dad, Rupe treats me very well.""
Her father pointed at her affectionately, a picture of paternal warmth and family harmony.
But Rupert's attention was drawn to his surroundings.
The walls were covered with annual family portraits of Lauretta from childhood to adulthood.
Her room was a carefully curated music studio, with an expensive piano adorned with delicate figurines.
He remembered Fidelia telling him how, after her parents' divorce, she and her mother had shuffled between relatives' homes.
Eventually, when no one would take them in, they had even taken shelter in an abandoned factory dormitory...
Rupert glanced at Ayden, a faint, almost imperceptible frown touching his brow.
After dinner, Rupert took his leave.
Back in his car, as he gazed into the deep night, Camilla's words—""She's dead""—echoed inexplicably in his ears.
He was silent for a moment, then took out his phone and opened a chat with the class monitor.
""You mentioned last time Fidelia was abroad?""
The reply came quickly, ""Yeah, her social media showed a location in Iceland.""
A screenshot followed.
In it, Fidelia stood under the aurora borealis in a white dress, her smile as radiant as ever.
Beside her stood a tall, unfamiliar man, his hand resting casually on her shoulder in an intimate pose.
The date stamp in the corner read: August 20th, less than a month ago.
A sudden, nameless fury shot through Rupert.
""Less than a month... How could a perfectly healthy person just die?"" he wondered.
He immediately called his assistant, his voice icy.
""I want to know exactly where Fidelia is right now. You have three days.""
Chapter 5
After the call was ended, his phone screen lit up with a message from Lauretta.
""Rupe, my parents loved you! They can't stop asking when we're planning the wedding.""
Rupert looked at the message and was about to reply when another message from her popped up.
""They mentioned that my side of the family isn't very large, so the guest list will mostly depend on yours.""
""Oh, my father had a daughter from a relationship before he married my mom, but they lost contact years ago. I hope you don't mind?""
""If you'd prefer a larger gathering, I could try to reach out to her.""
Rupert typed a reply, ""Unnecessary. Our affairs have nothing to do with outsiders.""
""You're right. My dad mentioned she moved abroad with her boyfriend. Best not to disturb her.""
Rupert's gaze lingered on the words ""her boyfriend"". His expression grew even more scornful.
The next day, Rupert had barely arrived at his office when his desk phone rang.
""Mr. Steele, Camilla Gilmore in the lobby insists on seeing you.""
Rupert tapped his fingers twice on the polished desk, a cold glint in his eyes.
""She's only pushing this hard to make the whole 'Fidelia's dead' con more convincing. That final payout is the real goal,"" he wondered.
His reply was curt. ""Not happening.""
Rupert didn't expect Camilla to wait outside the building for him all day.
As he left at the end of the workday, she rushed toward him, her face etched with exhaustion and urgency. ""Rupert, when will the final payment for the 'Twilight' series be released?""
His voice was icy. ""The money will be transferred when Fidelia comes to thank me in person.
""If she can't, don't expect to get her hands on that money and live large.""
Camilla stared at him in disbelief. ""You think Delia wanted that money for herself?""
Her mouth twisted, her eyes reddening. ""Rupert, she's really gone.
""She had a donation agreement drawn up before she died. The entire sum from the sale was designated for the Appalachia Children's Education Fund.
""The repairs for multiple school buildings are contingent on that money. The children's classrooms depend on it. If you're not going to honor it, release the claim immediately so I can find another buyer.""
Rupert's tone remained flat. ""Starting with the emotional blackmail now, are you?
""Let me be clear: unless Fidelia shows up herself, I will withhold that payment indefinitely.""
With that, he strode toward the black sedan waiting at the curb. ""Drive.""
As the car pulled away, Rupert watched Camilla's helpless figure standing alone in the rearview mirror, an inexplicable sense of irritation knotting in his chest.
When he snapped out of it, he found himself unconsciously searching for ""Appalachia Children's Education Fund"" on his phone.
Scanning the list of donations on the screen, he felt like he was losing his mind.
He closed his eyes briefly, his finger scrolling down the long donor list.
Then his gaze stopped abruptly.
Toward the end of the list, one entry was clearly marked: Donor: Starlight.
Rupert frowned, thinking, ""So Fidelia really was involved in charity work?""
Remembering Camilla's repeated insistence that Fidelia was dead, he pressed his lips together and instructed Esteban in the front seat.
""Find a way to track Fidelia's movements in recent years. And her medical records.""
""Yes, sir.""
When the car arrived at the apartment building, Rupert ran into Lauretta, who was on her way out.
He looked at the woman in a hurry, his tone mild. ""Is something wrong? You seem rushed.""
Lauretta's expression was troubled. ""There's an issue with a few of my photographs on consignment at the art center.
""I publicly promised that all proceeds from those specific pieces would go to charity.
""But the center discovered that another artist has copied my donation data and is claiming it as her own.
""Now my supporters are questioning the authenticity of my pledges. I have to go handle this personally.""
Rupert frowned as well, pulling out his phone. ""Did you find out who it is? I'll have my legal department assist you.""
Lauretta lowered her eyes and slowly uttered, ""Starlight.""
Rupert's expression darkened instantly.
Chapter 6
That evening, a legal notice was dispatched from the Steele Group, addressed directly to Starlight's studio.
""Photographer Starlight is hereby requested to provide a reasonable explanation within three days regarding the alleged misappropriation of donation data. Failure to comply will result in immediate legal action by the Steele Group legal department.""
The Steele Group's statement quickly gained traction online. The topics ""The Steele Group's rights"" and ""Starlight's fraud"" started trending.
The earlier sale of a photographic series for 5 million dollars had already brought Fidelia significant attention.
This new development caused an uproar.
""She built her whole image on charity, using her kindness as a ploy for pity? Did Starlight think we were all that gullible?""
""How dare she use money meant for children's education to boost her reputation and her prices? Her character is rotten to the core!""
""We must boycott her work! A disgrace like this should be banned from the industry for good!""
Soon, the social media accounts linked to Fidelia's studio were flooded with a torrent of condemnation.
Rupert scrolled through his phone screen, his eyes revealing no emotion.
With the situation escalating to this point, he didn't believe Fidelia could hold her ground much longer.
Yet, despite the public outcry, Fidelia's studio remained silent, allowing the storm to intensify.
A gossip blogger dug up the old story of Fidelia aggressively pursuing Rupert back then.
""Once schemed to climb the social ladder with Mr. Steele, only to lose her golden ticket due to short-sightedness. Now she's moved on to charity fraud.""
Reporters contacted the fund for a statement, but the staff declined to comment. This silence was widely interpreted as an admission of guilt.
Eventually, over a dozen collectors who owned Fidelia's work issued a joint statement demanding refunds.
What followed was an overwhelming surge of condemnation that buried Fidelia's reputation and her studio's credibility.
Late that night, the studio finally issued its first response.
""Gathering evidence takes time. But the proceeds from Starlight's sales have long since been transformed into new school buildings for the children of Appalachia.""
The statement included nine images: clear bank transfer records, screenshots of the donation agreement, and photos of several newly built, simple schoolhouses.
A finance professional commented: ""Judging from the transaction records, these transfers appear to be legitimate.""
But skepticism persisted.
""Even deducting the 5 million dollars from 'Twilight', Starlight has earned nearly 1.6 million dollars from other sales. How much of that was actually donated? This is still fraud.""
This comment was pushed to the top.
Throughout it all, Fidelia herself never said anything.
Rupert watched coldly as the controversy raged on, a faint, cold smile playing on his lips.
He had expected Fidelia to cave within twenty-four hours, but a full day and night passed with no sign of her.
His phone screen suddenly lit up. Rupert absently swiped it open, then froze.
The studio had issued a second statement. This time, it contained only one image.
It was a death certificate. The bright red official seal looked stark and jarring on the screen.
""This is to certify that Fidelia Putnam passed away on September 10, 2024, due to illness after failed resuscitation...""
The certificate caused a new wave of shock.
A different tone began to emerge in the comments.
""Fidelia is really dead? Could the fraud allegations be a misunderstanding?""
""The timeline shows she was already gone before the 'Twilight' series was sold. What would she gain from fraud now?""
Rupert stared at the death certificate, finding it utterly absurd.
After a moment's thought, he directly posted the screenshot of Fidelia's Icelandic social media post—the one the class monitor had sent—onto his own verified account.
He captioned it with just one line: ""What exactly is your illness, Fidelia?""
In the photo, Fidelia looked vibrant, her smile radiant, showing no trace of terminal illness.
Feeling a slight, grim satisfaction, Rupert tossed his phone aside and paid it no further mind.
Just then, Lauretta walked over with a fruit platter. ""Rupe, I'm so sorry for causing all this trouble for you.""
He shook his head. ""What matters to you, matters to me.""
She smiled at him. ""Oh, my parents were asking about our engagement plans...""
Rupert paused. ""There's no rush. Let's wait until this matter is fully resolved and your name is cleared.""
Lauretta masked a flash of impatience in her eyes and nodded obediently. ""Alright.""
She turned to leave but added over her shoulder, ""Then please don't delay, Rupe. My parents have already begun making preparations for our wedding.""
The mention of a wedding hit a nerve, making Rupert's expression tighten.
He remembered his mother, before her death, giving Fidelia a family heirloom—an emerald brooch.
His mother had said it was a token for her future daughter-in-law.
Rupert pressed his lips into a tight line, forcibly suppressing the memories surging in his mind.
He spent a sleepless night.
The next morning, as soon as Rupert arrived at the office, he saw a pale Camilla waiting for him, her eyes bloodshot.
Rupert pinched the bridge of his nose and said to security, ""Please escort her out. I don't want to see her near the building again.""
Restrained by security, Camilla stared at him in disbelief, her voice hoarse. ""Rupert, Delia poured her soul into every photograph. Why go this far?""
Rupert's steps halted briefly. His voice held no emotion. ""What does that have to do with me?
""Oh, tell Fidelia to return my mother's brooch. She has no right to keep it.""
As he turned to walk away, Camilla shouted after him, her voice sharp, ""Rupert, you want to know where Fidelia is, don't you?
""The coordinates are -83.5° West, 35.6° North.
""It's in a remote part of Appalachia. Go find her yourself!""
Chapter 7
Camilla's hoarse, desperate shout struck Rupert as nothing more than a pathetic performance.
His expression cold, he walked toward the elevator, throwing a command over his shoulder to security. ""Make sure she doesn't cause any more disruptions.""
Back in his office, Rupert picked up a file, but his concentration was shattered.
Almost against his will, he typed the coordinates Camilla had given into the mapping software on his computer.
After a moment, the screen loaded, pinpointing a location deep within the remote, rolling mountains of Appalachia—a landscape of endless green interspersed with stretches of barren land.
Rupert stared at the blinking red dot, his fingers tightening slightly on the mouse. He closed the window, trying to dismiss the strange unease settling in his chest.
Not long after, Esteban knocked and entered.
""Mr. Steele, media crews were waiting outside. They filmed what happened at the front of the building.""
Rupert's eyes sharpened. ""Why were they there?""
""Another part of Fidelia's scheme?"" he wondered.
Esteban looked tense. ""With the allegations about Ms. Wagner's donation data, several outlets have been monitoring our company's movements.""
Rupert's face darkened.
Esteban pressed on. ""Now, many people are commenting on our official social media, demanding we go to Appalachia to verify the truth.
""In addition, the documentary series Fact Finders contacted us proactively. They expressed willingness to supply a crew and join you for a full, verified recording of the journey.""
Rupert's lips pressed into a thin line.
Fact Finders was known for its rigorous, objective reporting. They didn't engage in sensationalism, only reporting verified facts.
The situation had escalated beyond containment. If he refused to go now, public sentiment could easily turn, accusing the Steele Group of evasion, which would harm both reputation and stock value.
He pinched the bridge of his nose, a flicker of derision in his eyes. ""Fine. Have PR draft a statement.""
If this was her plan, he'd meet her challenge head-on.
That afternoon, the Steele Group's official account posted an update.
""We have agreed to partner with Fact Finders for a documented journey to Appalachia, departing tomorrow, to seek clarity on recent allegations.""
The waiting public responded swiftly.
""Glad Mr. Steele is taking action. We want the truth!""
""No one should be able to hide behind a story of being 'dead'!""
""With Fact Finders involved, this is legit.""
Fidelia's studio remained silent.
The following day, filming commenced. The live stream went live, and viewer numbers climbed rapidly into the tens of thousands.
Comments flew by.
""Mr. Steele moves really fast!""
""A full documentary trek? This is serious.""
Rupert glanced at the feed, then closed his eyes, pretending to rest.
After days of travel, the convoy, led by a local guide, finally wound its way into the remote Appalachian coordinates.
The camera captured the view: rough, unpaved roads and simple wooden homes dotting the hillsides—a world away from the city's bustle.
In the car, Rupert's throat moved slightly.
This isolated, austere place bore no resemblance to any scenario where Fidelia might be living lavishly.
The documentary producer spoke from the back seat. ""Mr. Steele, the building ahead appears to be one of the schools supported by the education fund. Should we stop?""
Before Rupert could reply, their local guide turned around, a warm, weathered smile on his face.
""If you're after Ms. Putnam, you've found her place.
""Kids around here got a chance to learn thanks to her.
""Honestly, half the county owes her a debt.""
The guide's words were like a small, sharp splinter, working its way under Rupert's skin.
The live chat erupted.
""This has to be a setup! A hired actor!""
""Some random guide just knows her? Too absurd!""
""Take us to the school,"" Rupert said, his voice cool.
The vehicle soon stopped in front of a simple building with a hand-painted wooden sign: Fidelia Putnam Elementary School. The group followed the guide inside.
Several kids wearing patched-up clothes were hunched over pristine new desks, carefully forming letters.
A small girl ran up, clutching a pencil stub. She looked at the guide and asked, ""Did they bring the new books, sir? Ms. Putnam told us once the new books come, we can finally stop using the ground for our lessons.""
For a moment, Rupert, the crew, and the live stream fell completely silent.
Then a comment drifted past.
""If she's using these kids for sympathy, that's low.""
The guide spoke gently to the child, then turned to the group.
""She's up there,"" the guide said, pointing. ""On the pine ridge behind the school. You can't miss it.""
Rupert said nothing. The chat, however, grew active again.
""Here we go! Expose the fraud, Mr. Steele!""
""Using kids as props, she's heartless.""
Rupert's eyes skimmed the comments. Without a word, he turned and walked back to the vehicle.
The mountain air held a damp chill. When they reached the pine-covered ridge, the place was quiet, filled only with the sound of wind through the trees.
Skepticism flooded the stream.
""Seriously? Not a single person. Are they just wasting our time?""
""This looks completely deserted.""
Rupert frowned. Then, a faint, familiar glint caught his eye from further up the slope.
He looked up. Among the pine boughs, something seemed to catch the light.
An odd tightness gripped his chest.
The next moment, he was striding up the hill, the cameraman hurrying to follow.
As he climbed, the soft ground gave way beneath him, and the swish of the pine trees rose steadily around him.
Finally, Rupert reached the top of the ridge.
A simple grave, outlined with gathered stones, lay before him.
Around it were patterns made of sticks and bundles of dried wildflowers.
At its head stood a weathered wooden marker.
Fixed to a simple pine branch leaning against it was the emerald brooch.
The marker bore four deeply carved words: Fidelia Putnam. Rest Here.
The wind swept through the pines with a sound like a slow, endless sigh. Rupert stood utterly still, his mind blank.

For my visit, the chef/owner was away, and had handed over his restaurant to members of his team to prepare dinner in their own style, so I didn’t have the usual menu, but this was quite wonderful - each of the members of the team designing a dish, each with a fruit focus and paired with a tea-based cocktail.

The space is small and theatrical - you step through a tiny low door to a black counter curved around a lighted preparation area where food is finished, and drinks are prepared with tea ceremony dignity.

Mandarin sorbet with ginseng; burrata with hozuki fruit; a wonderful chestnut tiramisu with haskap berries; Sapporo yellow hamburger with sweet onions; celery seed ice cream with Japanese pear and white fungus; a parfait of white sesame, mandarin and cacao pulp; and a maitake mushroom risotto.

# NioCorp: Year-End 2025 Review — Why 2026 Is the Year

As 2025 comes to a close, it’s worth stepping back and looking at what actually happened — not just the stock price, but the *substance*. This year was not about celebration or speculative rerating. **2025 was a validation year — a structured march toward Final Investment Decision (FID).** And when viewed chronologically, the progress is hard to ignore.

# 4) Why NAMA Matters (And Why 2025 Quietly Changed Everything)

The acquisition of alloy IP and the formation of **NAMA (NioCorp Advanced Materials Alliance)** was one of the most underappreciated events of the year.

Plain English:

* NioCorp is no longer just selling oxides
* It’s positioning to sell **engineered alloys**
* That’s where margins, strategic value, and defense relevance live

[Sc-Al, Titanium and Niobium alloys are not theoretical anymore. They are tied to: Real components, Real platforms & Real Defense Primes](https://reddit.com/link/1prdtk2/video/gsqo0ujcsc8g1/player)

Sc-Al, Titanium, and Niobium alloys are not theoretical anymore. They are tied to:

* Real components
* Real platforms
* Real defense primes

**That’s a very different valuation framework than a traditional mine!**

# 5) Why the Stock Didn’t Reprice (Yet)

Late-year weakness in 2025 can be explained without conspiracy:

* Tax-loss selling
* Thin liquidity
* Validation still underway
* No final DFS or full assay set released yet

Markets do not price *progress* — they price **confirmation**.

# 6) Why “2026 Is the Year”

2026 is where **everything converges**:

**Remaining catalysts**

* Final assays (with credible potential for \~1.0M tonnes TREO)
* Updated DFS
* February 2026 Sc-Al alloy platform/component reveal (with defense primes)
* Binding offtake agreements
* ESIA completion
* EXIM / UK / German financing decisions
* Final Investment Decision (FID)
* Groundbreaking — potentially mid-2026, aligned with poison pill expiration

**That’s when the story shifts from** ***“can they?”*** **to** ***“this is happening.”***

# NioCorp Year-End 2025: Why This Was the Setup Year — and Why FEA IP Is the Keystone

As 2025 wraps up, it’s clear this was not a “share price year” — it was a **structural setup year**. NioCorp spent the year doing the hard, unglamorous work that serious projects require: drilling, validation, land acquisition, financing prep, and alignment with U.S. government and defense priorities. The result is that Elk Creek is no longer a speculative mineral deposit; it’s a **de-risked critical-materials platform** approaching Final Investment Decision (FID). That distinction matters — because markets reprice inevitability, not effort.

The most underappreciated development of 2025 was the maturation of **FEA-driven alloy IP**, now housed under **NAMA**. The key insight is simple but powerful: the FEA process **bypasses scandium metal entirely**, going **oxide → alloy directly**. That dramatically reduces cost, complexity, and CAPEX for early-stage alloy production. More importantly, it establishes a **repeatable framework**. NioCorp controls oxide production; NAMA controls oxide-to-alloy conversion. That same structure applies not just to Sc-Al, but to **Ti, & Nb-modified alloys, titanium pathways via TiCl₄ → sponge → alloy, and Nb₂O₅ additives for aerospace steels and superalloys**. Same logic. Same customers. Different alloys, sequenced over time.

This does *not* mean NioCorp is trying to do everything at once — and that’s where many investors get tripped up (including myself!). The strategy is deliberately modular. **The DFS and EXIM process finance the mine and oxide plant first — exactly what lenders require.** In parallel, **NAMA** advances alloys separately through DoD programs, Lockheed qualification work, and potential Title III or partner-funded facilities. Alloy plants, magnet production, and recycling are **optional upside modules**, not prerequisites for mine financing. **That separation is precisely why NAMA exists: it preserves flexibility, minimizes risk, and maximizes long-term value.**

IMHO For shareholders, this sequencing has been critical. NioCorp is not betting the mine on advanced manufacturing. It is **locking in the mine**, **while allowing alloys to mature in parallel until customers, funding, and scale are ready.** When those pieces align — post-FID — dedicated U.S. alloy facilities can be funded by government programs, strategic partners, or JVs with aerospace and defense primes. That is how platform value is built without jeopardizing execution.

When the dust settles, Elk Creek will not simply be “a mine.” Paired with NAMA, it becomes a **cornerstone of a U.S.-controlled, mine-to-alloy supply chain** spanning **Seven critical minerals across four defense-critical material chains**. That’s not incremental — it’s foundational. EXIM’s engagement signals it. The DoD’s involvement confirms it. And the global critical-minerals bottleneck is about to meet its first true American challenger in decades.

**Elk Creek is a U.S. national security asset.**  
NioCorp isn’t just part of the solution — **it’s the platform the solution gets built on!**  
""Buckle up. Strap in. **2026 is right around the corner.""**

[ALL ABOARD!.....& FULL STEAM AHEAD AS \\""2026 is the YEAR!\\""  Bring it on home team NioCorp.](https://reddit.com/link/1prdtk2/video/ut6gs5wmtc8g1/player)

**In Closing & IMHO-**

What NioCorp’s team accomplished in **2025 is exceptional by critical-minerals standards**, not just in volume of work, but in **execution discipline and transparency**. Most projects at this stage go quiet, hide behind consultants, or drip-feed vague updates. NioCorp did the opposite: they drilled, bought the land, advanced EXIM, raised capital when windows were open, pushed metallurgy forward, stood up NAMA, and still showed up repeatedly to explain *why* each step mattered. That level of **one-on-one shareholder engagement is rare** in this sector!

It also speaks to confidence. Management teams that don’t believe in their timelines avoid open dialogue; teams moving deliberately toward FID tend to engage because they understand the sequencing and aren’t afraid of scrutiny. **In NioCorp’s case, you could see the consistency: what Mark, Scott, Jim, and others said early in the year matched what actually happened by year-end. That alignment builds credibility — even when the share price doesn’t cooperate in the short term.**

When you compare Elk Creek to many other “critical mineral” stories, the difference is stark. Most are single-commodity, lightly drilled, underfunded, and years away from permits or financing clarity. **NioCorp is multi-mineral, land-secured, government-engaged, technically advancing, and openly marching toward FID.** That’s why long-term holders aren’t confused by the disconnect — they recognize it as **timing, not failure!!**

**In hindsight, 2025 will likely be remembered as the year NioCorp quietly crossed from “development story” into** **inevitability**. The market will catch up when validation milestones flip to irreversible ones. Until then, the work being done — and the way the team communicates it — is exactly what you want to see heading into 2026.

**""Wishing everyone & their families a Joyous & Merry Christmas 2025! As we stay tuned for 2026 & a prosperous New Year with many!""**

This fast, in part after reading about a few gallbladder issues on this sub, I decided to keep the heavy whipping cream in my coffee in the mornings, (2 tablespoons total per day)- and go for the flavored water enhancers.

My experience has been- awesome.  One noticeable difference is that I've pooped every day- like normal- except just.. a squirt.  lol sorry guys.  In pure water fasts the bowels do move but with less regularity. 

I've also been able to go much longer and comfortably with generally high energy (some lows).  I'm currently on day nine and have an absolute end point of the 24th- which will be 12 almost 13 days- my longest fast.  My longest before have been 9 or 10 days.

I am losing more weight daily than usual (1+ lbs everyday) because I'm doing a lot more exercise.  I'm used to exercise, and am a daily bicycle rider.  Keeping that up has been easy and feels good this fast.

I used to have stronger feelings about doing a 'pure' water fast.  Now, I will probably only fast with a daily small fat intake (cream in coffee) to contract the gallbladder and maintain regular gastro movement.  

Artificial flavored and sweetened water I think is probably more of the issue for me!  Cleansing and resetting the taste buds is one of the helpful things from fasting.  That I could see benefits from leaving out in the future.",14,1766235668.0,fasting,3,0.94,False

I recently went through a breakup because my ex was depressed and got overwhelmed by the idea of a relationship (we’re basically the same person mentally, it was spooky how similar we were)

I’ve left her alone for a few weeks now, but I’ve been thinking about my own patterns and how I showed up in our relationship and it made me really sad because I realised I couldn’t accept any of her safety? 

She wanted to do nice things for me like bring soup when I was sick or keep my favourite snacks (which you can’t find where we live) stocked in her cupboards, and I refused to let her, it just made me too uncomfortable! And every time we had a moment where she wanted me to be vulnerable, I’d skate over it or give her a fraction of the story. 

She was vulnerable though, she told me some really big things and she let me take care of her when she was sick, even though I know she felt the same way I did about receiving kindness. I know this isn’t WHY we broke up, but it sucks realising how much I pushed her away when I’ve spent so much of my life wishing that someone would be that nice to me. 

I’m going to text her when we’re both back from our holidays and give her the cliff notes of my realisation and see if she’s interested in getting coffee, but I feel like I ruined everything by not being brave enough to accept what she was giving me.

——————————————————————

1: Choose single player and vs race

2: choose any character and kart

3: choose any speed and com difficulty (I recommend easy)

4: have the same mandatory settings selected

4a: Make sure to choose the selected number of races to how many character you need to unlock (usually 8-9 races)

5: make sure that only the kamek orb appears with a white background (easy way is to All Off -> click on kamek orb)

6: use the list to select a course to the corresponding character

7: keep playing races u til you get all the characters

——————————————————————

Notes: Chargin’ Chuck, Coin Coffee Pianta, Spike, Nabbit and Wiggler can appear on every course that you play, the other characters you will need to play there selected track to easily unlock them.

Dry bones can also appear on the same track as fish bones.

It took me 1 race each to unlock all the track exclusives so it is a very high chance you get them on 1 try.

Took around 25-30 minutes on 150cc with the hyper pipe. (Varies on cc and skill)

Try to remain 1st-6th as kamek targets the front runners instead of the trailers.

Be prepared for a lot of havoc.

My(28f) bf(30m) have been dating for about 3 years now, living together for 8 months. We were in a LDR until we moved in together. This wasn’t really a thing until he moved in with me. I guess you could say that his real self has started to shine through. 

The issue I’m having is that he wants to know where I am constantly. Like he checks my location constantly. Sometimes he will text me right when I get to work and comment on how long my drive was or how early to work I am. 
He also wants me to text him when I go anywhere, like making stops to get coffee or stopping to get gasoline or when I’m grocery shopping, if I have to go to a different store because the first one did not have what I was needing. I have to let him know in advance that I’m going somewhere. On the occasion that I forget he rages and becomes upset. He says it’s because he needs routine. I feel it’s controlling and not something that happens in a healthy relationship. I do my best to keep him updated but sometimes I fail.  
 
 It’s been a huge issue primarily due to this is not something I’m use to doing so I forget to let him know sometimes. It turns in to him saying that I don’t listen to him and I don’t care about him or his feelings. Which isn’t true. On the off chance I fail to text him it will turn in to days of him being angry. It’s draining.

---

David had been showing up early for three weeks.

It started the week after the lockout incident. His lab had been cut short. Broken equipment, professor's apologies, dismissed an hour early. An opportunity. He'd walked out into the late afternoon with time to kill and nowhere to be until rugby practice at 19:30.

He could have gone back to his flat. Could have grabbed food, reviewed notes, done literally anything else.

Instead, he'd gone to the pitch.

Extra conditioning. Getting ahead of the pack. All the things a serious athlete was supposed to do. *Right?*

Abi's soccer training started at 18:30. If he arrived at 18:15, he got fifteen minutes where they occupied the same space. It wasn't a date. It wasn't even a conversation most days. But it was her, and he'd stopped pretending that didn't matter. He was creating his own opportunities now.

18:15. Here he was again on another cold November evening. The sports complex hummed with activity under the harsh floodlights. He started jogging, his body protesting at first after hours folded into lecture seats, but the cold air felt sharp and clean against his face. His stride loosened. His breathing deepened as the cold air refreshed him from the inside out.

The pitch was empty. For now.

Abi arrived with her teammates, her ponytail swinging, her kit bag slung casually over her shoulder. Her long-sleeve training top clung to her chest and waist, and black leggings beneath her shorts hugged the curve of her ass and traced the shape of her legs. From across the pitch, he could see every contour, the way she moved with easy confidence. 

His stride faltered. His pulse kicked up.

She glanced over mid-conversation, her gaze sweeping the pitch, and found him. Their eyes met.

She smiled and lifted her hand in a brief wave. It was the same casual gesture she'd given him in the café last Monday when she'd called him over to her table instead of letting him sit alone.

David waved back, trying to look casual, and kept running.

*There. Don't fuck it up by staring.*

But as he ran, his mind went back to that café. He'd only wanted a quick coffee before his next lecture. But she'd waved him over, and suddenly two hours had passed. They'd talked about his problem sets, her thesis stress, a terrible film they'd both hated. She'd leaned forward when he spoke, her chin resting on her hand, her eyes locked on his like he was the only person in the room. And when he'd made a stupid joke about the mess in his room being ""high entropy"", ""thermodynamics"" and ""just basic physics really"", she'd laughed, really laughed, and her hand had briefly touched his forearm.

*She stayed. She didn't have to, but she stayed.*

David shook off the memory and kept running, his muscles warming up now. *Like an engine reaching operating temperature.*

Abi dropped into a deep hamstring stretch, her torso folding forward, her ass lifted and perfectly showcased even beneath the leggings and shorts. The sight triggered a sharp memory: yesterday, the lift in the library. They'd stepped in together, alone at first, standing on opposite sides. Then the doors opened on the next floor and a crowd of students piled in. She'd been forced back, step by step, until she was pressed flush against him, her back to his chest, her ass against his hips, his back against the wall. As if out of instinct, David had put his hand on her hip. Abi didn't  move, if anything, she settled against him. Just stayed there as the lift climbed three floors, maybe even leaned into him a bit. He'd breathed in the scent of her hair, that familiar citrus cucumber aloe vera smell, and felt the heat of her body through their clothes. He had been trying to be cool about it, but his cock wasn't. *Shit, surely she must feel this right?* as his half erect cock was pressing against her ass through his jeans. When the doors finally opened, she'd stepped out without a word, without a glance back. 

*She knows exactly what she's doing.*

David kept running.

*Focus. You're here for conditioning. Right?*

After the lockout, after the kiss and her retreat, things had changed. They texted constantly now, back and forth throughout the day. Coffee three or four times a week, her waving him over to her table like it was routine. She sought him out now. Actively. Deliberately. Whatever it was they were doing, they were both doing it.

River, one of the defenders in Abi's team jogged by and called out, loud enough to carry, ""Your boy's here again, I see.""

Abi went still. Her shoulders pulled back, her expression flattening. *Shit, make it sound casual* ""He's not my boy.""

River shrugged and moved on. Abi turned away, rolling her neck, shaking her arms, but the tension didn't leave.

David watched from across the pitch, the words faintly ringing in his ears.

*Not my boy.*

Maybe he'd been reading this whole thing wrong.

David looked away and dropped into his first set of burpees. Down. Push. Jump. Repeat. The motion was automatic, but his focus wasn't there. He kept seeing the way Abi had locked up when her teammate spoke. The sharpness in her voice. *He's not my boy.* He'd thought the coffee, the texts, the lingering looks meant something. But maybe he'd been projecting. Maybe he'd built this into more than it was. Maybe she really did see him as just... nothing.

He continued his training.

""You're keen lad, I'll give you that."" Liam said, dropping his bag on the sideline. ""Showed up early again, did you?""

""Yeah,"" David said. ""Just getting some extra work in.""

""Right. Extra work."" Liam's grin widened. He glanced past David toward the soccer pitch, then back at him. ""Lad, you've been doing this for weeks now. Showing up early. Running laps. Doing your little fitness routine."" He paused, letting the words hang. ""You're either getting obsessive about conditioning, or you're falling for the soccer girls.""

David forced a laugh. ""Fuck off, Liam.""

Liam laughed, unbothered. ""I don't know which is worse, to be honest.""

""All the way back to where you came from."" David continued.

*Liam wasn't wrong.*

And if Liam had noticed, others probably had too.

Liam clapped him on the shoulder, still grinning. ""Relax, lad. I'm only slagging you. Come on, let's get the hitshields out.""

David nodded, but the tension in his chest didn't relax. He glanced across the pitch one more time. Abi was laughing at something one of her teammates said, her head tipped back, completely unaware he was watching.

After practice, David headed to the bar with his teammates for the social. The place was alive—music thumping from the speakers, conversations layered over each other, the sharp clink of glasses being set down on tables. The rugby lads were already filtering in, claiming tables, voices loud and easy.

David walked in behind Liam and immediately noticed the crowd. A lot of women. He recognized a few faces from the soccer team, girls he'd seen at the pitch during the overlapping sessions.

*Wait.*

His pulse quickened.

*If her teammates are here, then maybe.. *

He scanned the room, trying to look casual, and then he saw her.

Abi had been at the bar for twenty minutes when the rugby guys started filtering in. She sat at one of the high top tables with Chloe and River. She'd recognized a few of them immediately, big frames, loud voices, the unmistakable energy. She'd wondered, briefly, if David would show up.

Then she saw him.

He was wearing slacks and a white button-down shirt, the fabric crisp and clearly ironed. *Of course David irons his shirt to go to a social.* The thought almost made her smile, but her stomach twisted instead.

This wasn't the pitch. This wasn't the library, the café. This wasn't a carefully curated situation where she could keep him at a comfortable distance while still enjoying his presence, still feeling the weight of his longing for her.

This was a social setting. Public. Exposed. Whatever interaction they had, any interaction, would be on full display. Not just for strangers, but for their own social circles.

*Fuck.*

She turned back to Chloe, nodding along to whatever she was saying, and forced herself not to look at him again.

David sat down across from Liam, who was already deep into a wild story about one of trips he and the team had done in the past. David nodded, laughed at the right moments, but his focus kept drifting.

He glanced over at Abi.

She looked good. She was wearing high-waisted jeans and a fitted long-sleeve shirt that hugged her frame in a way that made his mouth go dry. The jeans sat perfectly on her hips, and the shirt did nothing to hide the curve of her tits or the shape of her ass when she shifted her weight.

*Christ.*

He looked away, back to Liam, but his gaze pulled toward her again a moment later.

Liam stopped mid-sentence. He turned in his seat, following David's line of sight across the bar. Then he turned back, a slow grin spreading across his face.

""Lad,"" Liam said, leaning forward slightly, ""conditioning is over. Either you put in the work or you don't, but you won't get fitter by just looking at it.""

David's face flushed. ""Fuck off.""

Liam's grin widened. He didn't push it. He just shrugged and took a sip from his glass, still smirking.

River leaned back in her seat, watching the rugby guys filter in. ""They're always so loud,"" she said, half to herself. Her eyes swept the room, landing on David's table for a moment. ""Some of them look quite young though. Like actual teenagers.""

She took a sip of her drink, then added casually, ""They're hot, but I'd feel weird going for someone that much younger. Like raiding a daycare or something.""

Chloe laughed at something else entirely, already talking about one of their upcoming matches.

Abi's stomach tightened. She kept her face neutral, nodding along to Chloe's words, but River's comment echoed in her head.

*Weird. Daycare.*

River stood, draining her glass. ""Right, I need another drink."" She didn't wait for a response, just headed toward the bar.

Abi watched her go, then forced herself to focus back on Chloe, who was still talking about the match.

*Yeah. It would be weird, right?*

David was trying not to stare at Abi across the bar. He failed. Again. Her head was tilted back, laughing at something Chloe had said, and the sound of it cut through the noise like a blade.

*Don't make it weird. Just look away.*

He forced his eyes back to Liam, who was mid-sentence about something David wasn't listening to.

""Lad, you've been looking past me rather than at me for the last thirty minutes."" Liam's grin was sharp. ""Time to get into action.""

David's stomach dropped. ""I'm not...""

""Right. Time's up, let's do this."" Liam clapped him on the shoulder and stood, already walking across the bar.

*Shit. Fucking Liam. Always diving in, never shying away from contact. Admirable on the field, a pain in the ass right now.*

David had no choice but to follow. His heart hammered in his chest. *This is like watching a car crash in slow motion* Liam had no idea he already knew Abi. No idea they'd spent the last three weeks in a careful, undefined thing that existed entirely in private. And now Liam was about to blow it wide open in the middle of a crowded bar, treating it like a cold approach.

Liam strode up to Abi and Chloe with the easy confidence of a man who knew neither fear or shame. He flashed a grin. ""Evening, ladies. I'm Liam. This is David."" He gestured back at David, who was standing slightly behind him, frozen. ""He's been admiring the view all night and needed a push.""

David's eyes met Abi's for a split second. Her expression flickered—surprise, then panic, then something closer to resigned amusement. She recovered fast, her face smoothing into polite neutrality. She extended her hand toward Liam, then toward David.

""Abi,"" she said, her voice even. ""Nice to meet you.""

""Yeah. Hi,"" David mumbled, shaking her hand. Her grip was firm, formal, and lasted exactly one second longer than it should have.

Chloe, seated beside Abi, looked between the four of them with barely concealed amusement. She leaned back, one eyebrow raised. ""Well, this is bold. I respect it."" She looked at Liam. ""I'm Chloe. Midfielder. You?""

""Flanker,"" Liam said, matching her energy. ""Fast, aggressive, and *very* good at finding gaps.""

Chloe snorted. ""Subtle.""

""I try not to.""

""So,"" Abi said, her voice carefully neutral. ""Rugby, right?""

""Yeah,"" David said. His voice came out stiff, awkward. ""First year.""

""Cool."" She paused. ""How's that going?""

""Good. Yeah. It's... it's good.""

*This is excruciating.* Abi thought.

Liam and Chloe's conversation grew louder, more animated. Chloe laughed at something Liam said, swatting his arm. The two of them fell into easy banter, their voices blending into the noise of the bar. They were fully absorbed in each other now, creating a small bubble of noise that gave David and Abi a sliver of privacy.

Abi glanced at him, and for the first time since Liam had dragged him over, she smiled. A real smile. Small, genuine, and entirely for him.

""So,"" she said, her voice low, teasing. ""'Admiring the view,' huh?""

David exhaled, the tension in his chest loosening. He smirked. ""Can you blame me?""

Her smile widened. ""No. I really can't.""

And just like that, they slipped back into it. The easy rhythm. The unspoken understanding. The rest of the bar faded into background noise.

""You know,"" Abi said, leaning in slightly, ""Liam's got balls. I'll give him that.""

""It does appear that way,"" David said with a small smile.

Abi's eyes glinted with mischief. ""Maybe he got bonked on the head a few times too many as well.""

David laughed, quiet and genuine, and the weight of the last few minutes dissolved. They talked in low voices, their words just for each other. Inside jokes. Shared glances. The kind of conversation that didn't need to be loud to matter.

For a few minutes, it was almost perfect.

Abi glanced at her phone. Not to check messages—just the time. 23:17. She looked back at David, her expression shifting from playful to something more purposeful.

""It's getting late,"" she said, her voice low. ""And I've got an early morning."" She glanced at him, then away, a small smile playing at her lips. ""Think you could walk me home? Make sure I get there safely? I could use someone strong.""

The word landed deliberately. David's breath caught.

*Oh.*

""Yeah,"" he said, keeping his voice steady. ""Of course.""

They slipped out separately, Abi first, weaving through the thick of the crowd. David followed thirty seconds later, taking a different route to the door, his heart hammering against his ribs. The cold night air hit him the moment he stepped outside, sharp and bracing after the warmth of the bar. Abi was already a few paces ahead, her hands shoved into her jacket pockets, her breath misting in the glow of the streetlights.

He caught up to her quickly, falling into step beside her.

David and Abi walked quickly, side by side, not touching. The noise of the bar faded behind them. The street was quieter now, lined with parked cars and the occasional lit window.

Abi burshed her hand against his.

Her fingers curled around his palm, and she squeezed once.

David stopped. He turned, pulled her to him, and kissed her.

It wasn't gentle.

His hands cupped her face, then slid down to her hips, gripping hard. Abi gasped into his mouth, her hands fisting his shirt, pulling him closer. Her tongue slid against his, and he groaned, low and rough. She pressed into him, her body arching, and his hands moved—one sliding up her back, the other gripping her ass through her jeans.

They broke apart, panting, foreheads pressed together.

""We should probably go,"" Abi whispered, breathless.

David nodded, his voice hoarse. ""Yeah.""

She grabbed his hand and pulled him down the street.

They didn't speak. They didn't need to.

Inside the bar, River leaned against the bar, waiting for her refill. She glanced toward the door and saw the rugby boy, the one she had teased Abi with, slip out. A memory clicked: Abi had left not ten seconds before him.

River’s lips curved into a small, sharp smirk. She pulled out her phone, her thumb hovering over the group chat, Queens of the Pitch 💚⚽.

They stumbled through the door of Abi's flat, and she kicked it shut behind them. Before David could take another breath, she shoved him against the wall and kissed him hard. Her mouth was hot, demanding, and he responded instantly, his hands flying to her body. He grabbed her tits through her shirt, squeezed her ass, gripped her hips, pulling her against him. She made a low sound in her throat and kissed him harder.

*Finally. Fuck, finally.*

David felt her hands move to his belt, still kissing him as she worked. She yanked the leather free of the buckle, popped the button on his trousers, dragged the zip down, and then she broke the kiss and dropped to her knees.

David's breath caught.

She freed his cock from his slacks and boxers in one smooth motion, wrapping her hand around the base. She looked up at him, her eyes glinting, and then took him in her mouth.

""Fuck,"" David grunted, his head falling back against the wall.

Her mouth was wet and warm, her tongue swirling around the head of his cock before she took him deeper. His hands found her hair, not pulling, just holding, grounding himself as she worked him with her lips and tongue. She bobbed her head, sucking hard, and he felt the tension coiling tight in his gut, weeks of frustration condensing into a single, focused point.

*Too fast. Too fucking fast.*

""Abi,"" he gasped. ""Please. I don't want to cum just yet.""

She pulled off him slowly, dragging her tongue along the underside of his cock as she did. She looked up at him and grinned. Then she stood, kissed him again, and took his hand, leading him toward her bedroom.

David shrugged off his shirt as they walked, the buttons giving way under his shaking fingers. By the time they crossed the threshold, the shirt was on the floor behind him.

Abi turned to face him, and David pushed her backward onto the bed. She landed with a soft gasp, her eyes wide and bright, and he climbed over her, his hands going to the hem of her shirt. He yanked it up and over her head, tossing it aside. Abi's hands flew to her jeans, unbuttoning and shoving them down her hips in quick, jerky movements. David helped, tugging them the rest of the way off and dropping them on the floor.

She grabbed his shoulders and pulled him down onto her, kissing him as their bodies pressed together. His hands slid behind her back, fingers finding the clasp of her bra. He undid it in one smooth motion.

*Where the fuck did he learn how to do that?* Abi thought, surprised and impressed in equal measure.

David pulled the bra free and tossed it aside, exposing her tits. He didn't hesitate. He lowered his mouth to her nipple, sucking hard, his hand gripping her ass and pulling her against him.

Abi moaned, her back arching off the bed. ""Fuck, David.""

Her hands moved to his slacks, tugging at the waistband, urging him to take them off. He pulled back just long enough to shove them down, kicking them off along with his boxers. Then his hands moved to her hips, fingers hooking into the thin string of her thong, and he dragged it down her legs.

He paused, his hands resting on her thighs, his breathing heavy. He looked at her, his voice rough. ""Condom?""

Abi's mind went blank for a second, then raced.

*I want to feel him. Bare. Raw. No barriers. Just him inside me, real and intimate and ...*

The thought was intoxicating. Dangerous. It was also the last thread of distance she could hold onto, the one thing that kept this from spiraling completely out of her control.

She reached over to her nightstand, fumbling in the drawer, and pulled out a condom. She handed it to him, her hand steady even as her heart pounded.

David took it, tearing the wrapper open. Abi lay back, watching him, her hand drifting down between her legs. She started playing with her pussy, her fingers moving in slow, teasing circles over her clit, her eyes locked on him.

*Look at me. Watch me.*

David's eyes flicked down to her hand, and his jaw tightened. He rolled the condom on quickly, then climbed back onto the bed, covering her body with his. He kissed her hard, his hips settling between her thighs, his cock pressing against her wet pussy. He felt the warmth of her slit against the head of his cock. He was lined up perfectly. He broke the kiss, and looked Abi right in the eyes.

Then he pushed in.

Abi gasped, her hands flying to his shoulders, nails digging into his skin. The stretch was sharp and immediate, her body opening for him. He didn't stop, pushing deeper until he was fully seated inside her. He held still for a second, his forehead pressed against hers, both of them breathing hard.

Then he started to move. Slow at first, deliberate thrusts that dragged his cock almost all the way out before driving back in. Abi's legs wrapped around his hips, heels digging into his ass, pulling him deeper with each stroke.

""Harder,"" she breathed.

David's hips snapped forward, the pace shifting immediately. The slow, measured rhythm gave way to something raw and urgent. He fucked her hard, his cock slamming into her with each thrust, the bed shaking beneath them. Abi moaned, her arms wrapping around his back, her face buried in his neck, her breath hot against his skin.

""Fuck, yes,"" she gasped. ""Just like that. Don't stop.""

David grunted, his hands gripping her hips, holding her in place as he drove into her again and again. The sound of skin slapping against skin filled the room, mixed with her gasps and his rough, breathless grunts.

Then David pulled out. Abi whimpered at the loss, but he grabbed her hips and flipped her over onto her knees. She landed face-down in the pillow, her ass in the air, and David's hands gripped her hips, pulling her back onto his cock.

He fucked her hard, the angle deeper, more intense. Abi's moans were muffled by the pillow, her hands fisting the sheets.

*Fuck. Fuck. Yes.*

Abi pushed herself up on her hands, twisting her upper body to look back at him. She reached around, grabbing the back of his neck, and pulled him down to kiss her. Their mouths met, messy and breathless, and she moaned into his mouth.

She broke the kiss, her voice commanding. ""Lie down.""

David pulled out and fell onto his back. Abi climbed on top of him, straddling his hips, and sank down onto his cock in one smooth motion. She started riding him, her hips rolling in a steady rhythm, her hands braced on his chest.

David's hands moved to her tits, squeezing, his thumbs brushing over her nipples. He looked up at her, taking in the sight: her flushed face, her hair falling around her shoulders, her tits bouncing with each movement.

*Fucking perfect.*

Abi shifted her hips, grinding down onto his cock instead of bouncing. She moved in tight, deliberate circles, her clit rubbing against the base of him with each rotation. The pressure built fast, a hot, coiling tension low in her belly. Her breath came in short, sharp gasps.

She needed more.

Her hand moved down between her legs, fingers finding her clit. She rubbed in quick, practiced circles, her other hand bracing on David's chest to steady herself. The dual sensation—his cock filling her, her fingers working her clit—sent a bolt of pure heat through her body.

""Fuck, David,"" she moaned, her voice breaking. ""You feel so fucking good.""

Abi's fingers moved faster over her clit, her hips grinding down hard onto David's cock. She felt herself getting close, the tension coiling tight in her core. But then she felt it—the shift in his breathing, the way his grip on her hips tightened, his fingers digging into her flesh.

""Abi,"" David gasped, his voice strained. ""I'm gonna cum. I can't—fuck, I can't hold it.""

Abi's eyes snapped open. She lifted herself off him immediately, his cock slipping out of her. David groaned at the loss, his hips bucking upward instinctively, chasing the heat. Abi's hands moved to the base of his cock, gripping the condom, and she rolled it off in one smooth motion. She tossed it aside, not caring where it landed.

Then she lowered her mouth onto him.

David's back arched off the bed, a guttural sound tearing from his throat. Her mouth was hot and wet, her tongue swirling around the head of his cock before she took him deeper. She sucked hard, her hand wrapping around the base, stroking in rhythm with her mouth.

*Holy fuck.*

David's hands fisted the sheets, his entire body tensing. The sensation was overwhelming—her lips, her tongue, the suction, all of it pushing him right to the edge. He tried to hold on, tried to make it last just a few seconds longer, but it was useless.

""Abi,"" he choked out, his voice breaking.

She didn't pull off. She kept going, sucking harder, her hand moving faster, and then David came with a strangled groan, his hips jerking as he spilled into her mouth. Abi didn't flinch. She swallowed, her throat working, taking everything he gave her.

*She's swallowing. Fuck, she's actually—*

When the last shudder passed through him, Abi pulled off slowly, her tongue dragging along the underside of his cock one last time. She wiped the corner of her mouth with the back of her hand, then lay down beside him, resting her head on his chest.

David's arm came around her automatically, his hand settling on her hip. His chest rose and fell beneath her cheek, his heartbeat still pounding hard. For a moment, they just lay there, breathing together, the tension of the last few minutes slowly unwinding.

*Wait. Shit. She didn't cum.*

The realization hit him like a cold shock. He'd been so lost in the moment, so overwhelmed by the sensation of her mouth, that he hadn't thought about it. But now, lying here with her, he felt it—the guilt, the panic.

*Fuck. I'm supposed to be good at this. She's supposed to enjoy it as much as I do. What if she thinks I'm selfish? What if she thinks I don't care?*

He couldn't let that happen. Not with her.

David shifted, turning onto his side to face her. He kissed her, slow and deliberate, his hand sliding down her stomach. His fingers found her pussy, still wet, still hot, and he started stroking her gently.

Abi's breath hitched, her eyes opening in surprise.

*What is he...*

""David?"" she whispered, her voice uncertain.

He pulled back just enough to look at her, his hand still moving between her legs. ""I want you to cum too,"" he said, his voice low and steady.

Abi stared at him for a second, her mind catching up.

*Of course he does.*

The thought sent a warm, unfamiliar feeling through her chest, and she didn't know what to do with it. So she focused on the physical instead.

David's fingers moved in slow, deliberate circles over her clit, the pressure light but constant. Abi's breathing deepened, her hips shifting to meet his touch. He kept the rhythm steady, watching her face, reading her body. She enjoyed it—the steady rhythm, the deliberate attention—but she wanted more.

She let him work for a bit, her eyes half-closed, her hand resting on his wrist, not guiding, just feeling. The tension built gradually, a slow heat spreading through her core. Her hand covered his, pressing his fingers harder against her clit for a few seconds before guiding his hand lower. 

""Finger me,"" she said, her voice rough with want.

David nodded. He brought two fingers to his mouth, wetting them with his tongue, then slid them inside her. Abi gasped, her hips rolling against his hand. He curled his fingers upward, finding the spot that made her breath catch, and started moving in a steady rhythm.

Abi's hand slid down between her legs, her fingers finding her clit. She rubbed in quick, practiced circles, her other hand gripping David's shoulder for balance. The dual sensation—his fingers inside her, her own hand on her clit—sent a bolt of heat through her body.

David lowered his mouth to her tits, sucking on her nipple, his tongue swirling around the hard peak. Abi moaned, her back arching off the bed, her hips grinding against his hand.

""Fuck, David, just like that,"" she gasped. ""Don't stop.""

He didn't. His fingers kept moving, steady and relentless, and his mouth stayed on her tits, sucking and licking as she came apart beneath him. Abi's hand moved faster over her clit, the tension coiling tighter and tighter until it snapped.

She came hard, her entire body tensing, her thighs trembling, her hand gripping David's shoulder so hard her nails dug into his skin. She cried out, her voice breaking, and David kept fingering her through it, his pace steady, drawing out every last shudder.

When the last wave passed, Abi's body went slack, her breathing ragged. She looked up at David, her eyes half-lidded, and pulled him down into a deep, slow kiss. Her hand cupped the back of his neck, holding him there, her tongue sliding against his.

They lay there for a moment, tangled together, Abi's breathing slowly returning to normal. David's hand rested on her hip, his thumb tracing lazy circles on her skin. She could feel his heartbeat against her ribs, steady and strong.

Then she felt something else.

His cock, pressed against her thigh, was hard again.

Abi pulled back just enough to look down, then back up at him, one eyebrow raised. ""Seriously?""

David's face flushed, but he didn't look away. ""Yeah,"" he said, his voice rough. ""I can't help it. You're just... fuck, Abi.""

She felt a thrill run through her at the raw honesty in his voice. No performance. No pretense. Just him, wanting her.

*This is different.*

She kissed him, slow and deep, her hand sliding down his chest. He responded immediately, his hands moving to her waist, pulling her closer. The kiss deepened, and Abi felt the shift—this wasn't the frantic urgency from before. This was something else.

David pulled back, his breathing heavy, and reached over to the nightstand. He grabbed another condom, tearing the wrapper open and rolling it on quickly. Then he settled between her thighs, his weight braced on his forearms, and looked down at her.

For a moment, neither of them moved.

Then David kissed her, slow and deliberate, as he guided himself inside her. Abi gasped against his mouth, her legs wrapping around his waist. He didn't break the kiss. He kept it slow, steady, his hips rolling in a measured rhythm.

His forehead pressed against hers, their breath mingling, and he whispered her name.

""Abi.""

Her chest tightened, something warm and unfamiliar blooming beneath her ribs. She pulled him into another kiss, her hands moving to his face, holding him there.

David's pace quickened, his hips snapping forward harder, but his eyes stayed locked on hers. Abi couldn't look away. The intensity in his gaze made her breath catch, made her heart pound harder than it should.

""David,"" she breathed.

He groaned, his hand gripping her thigh, hitching her leg higher. The angle shifted, driving him deeper, and Abi cried out, her nails raking down his back.

His hand moved to her face, cupping her cheek, his thumb brushing over her skin. The tenderness of it sent a jolt through her, something she couldn't name and didn't want to examine.

David's breathing grew ragged, his rhythm faltering. Abi tightened her legs around him, pulling him deep, and kissed him hard.

""Cum for me,"" she whispered against his lips.

David's body tensed, his hips driving forward one last time as he came with a low groan. He buried his face in her neck, his arms wrapping around her as the last shudders passed through him.

""Abi,"" he murmured.

She held him, her hands in his hair, her own breathing uneven. They stayed like that, wrapped up in each other, the world forgotten.

David finally lifted his head, looking down at her with a dazed expression. He kissed her softly, his hand still cradling her face.

They settled into the bed together, and he removed the condom, tossing it toward the bin. He missed, but neither cared.

They lay tangled in the sheets, sweaty and spent, the room dark and quiet except for their heartbeats.

David's hand rested on Abi's hip, his thumb tracing lazy, absent patterns on her skin. Her fingers combed slowly through his hair, the repetitive motion soothing, grounding. The room was still, the only sound their breathing—slower now, deeper, syncing without effort.

Abi felt the weight of his arm across her waist, the warmth of his body pressed against hers. It was comfortable. Easy. Intimate.

*This is nice.*

David shifted slightly, pulling her closer, her face buried in his neck. His breath slow and heavy in her ear, his body relaxed and heavy with approaching sleep.

Then, quiet and unguarded, he murmured, ""I like you.""

Abi's breath caught.

Her entire body went still, her mind suddenly loud in the silence.

*I like you too.*

The words formed in her mind, simple and true, and that's what made them terrifying.

*He's a first-year, he only just started busy with figuring university life out. I'm a fourth-yaer, busy with well being a serious fourth-year student. Not... this. Not him.*

She could already hear the judgment, the raised eyebrows, the jokes. Three years wasn't supposed to matter, but it did. In the hierarchy of university, it absolutely did.

*What does it say about me that I'm here, in bed with a nineteen-year-old boy?*

The word ""boy"" kept ringing in her head, even though it didn't fit him. Not really. Not the way he'd just touched her, the way he'd looked at her.

*But that's what everyone else will see.*

Her hand, resting against his chest, curled into a fist. Her nails pressed into her palm, the sharp sting grounding her, keeping the spiral at bay. She forced herself to breathe, forced her fingers to relax, to unfurl against his skin.

Abi didn't reply. She couldn't form the words, couldn't untangle the knot of wanting him and fearing what it meant. So she did the only thing that felt safe: she pressed closer, burying her face in his neck, her arms tightening around him. Her grip was harder than it needed to be, almost defensive.

*Fuck.*

The thoughts slowly fading as she drifted into a slumber.

On the nightstand, Abi's phone screen lit up, the glow was cold and blue against the warm shadows of the room. Neither of them noticed. David's breathing had gone deep and even. Abi's eyes were closed, her face still buried in his neck.

*I remember sitting in a draughty coffee shop in Manchester back in 2012, speaking with a local locksmith who was at his wit's end. He’d been in business for twenty years, knew every ward in the city like the back of his hand, yet his phone had stopped ringing. Why? Because while he was busy cutting keys, the ""digital High Street"" had moved. His competitors—some with half his experience—were appearing at the top of Google, while he was buried on page four, effectively invisible to anyone under the age of 50.*

*In the UK, the digital landscape is more crowded than a London Underground carriage at 8:45 AM. If you aren't visible, you don't exist. But here is the good news: improving your presence doesn't require a six-figure agency retainer or a PhD in computer science. It requires a disciplined, 30-day tactical strike. Whether you’re a boutique in Brighton or a consultancy in Cardiff, this guide will move the needle on your* [*UK online visibility for small business*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#)*, focusing on what actually converts in 2025.*

# Stop Shouting into the Void: Why Your Current Strategy is Failing

*Most UK business owners approach ""online visibility"" like they’re throwing darts in the dark. They post a random update on LinkedIn once a fortnight, ignore their Google Business Profile, and wonder why the leads aren't flowing. Think of your online presence like a traditional British pub; it doesn't matter how good the ale is if there’s no sign outside, the windows are boarded up, and the door is locked.*

*The problem is often ""Digital Fragmentation."" You might have a website, but is it talking to the search engines? You might be on social media, but are you appearing in local search results? In 2025, search engines like Google and Bing prioritize ""Entities""—they want to know that you are a real, verified UK business with a physical footprint or a defined service area. Without this, you're just noise.*

[UK SMEs can dominate Google in 2025 with a clear blueprint for online visibility.](https://preview.redd.it/7248fp4fuc8g1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db3bac769ce90ec66513f3d0282de54287121df1)

# Try This Tomorrow:

*Perform a ""Incognito Search"" for your core service + your city (e.g., ""Plumber in Reading""). If you aren't in the top 3 Map results or the first 5 organic links, your priority for the next 48 hours is cleaning up your NAP (Name, Address, Phone Number) consistency across the web.*

# The First 10 Days: Building Your UK Authority Foundations

*Visibility starts with verification. Before you try to ""game"" the algorithm, you must prove you belong. In the UK, search engines look for specific trust signals: a registered office (often cross-referenced with Companies House), local area codes, and presence in authoritative directories. This is where a* [*UK online business directory*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#) *acts as the scaffolding for your SEO efforts.*

*During these first ten days, your goal is to create a ""Citations Fortress."" This isn't just about being listed; it's about being listed correctly. Any discrepancy between your website and your directory listings can dilute your ""Trust Score."" If one site says ""St."" and another says ""Street,"" Google’s algorithm gets a microscopic headache. Multiply that by fifty listings, and you’ve got a visibility migraine.*

# Auditing Your Local SEO Footprint

*Start by identifying every corner of the web where your business is mentioned. For most, this includes the ""Big Three"" (Google, Apple, Bing) but also niche-specific UK platforms. Beyond the global giants, appearing in a* [*UK business directory*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#) *that Google recognizes as authoritative for the British market is essential. It provides a localized backlink that signals your relevance to UK-based users.*

* *Claim and verify your Google Business Profile (GBP).*
* *Ensure your business category is as specific as possible (e.g., ""Italian Restaurant"" not just ""Restaurant"").*
* *Update your opening hours, including upcoming Bank Holidays.*
* *Secure a* [*free business listing UK*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#) *to anchor your local authority.*

# Days 11-20: Content That Answers the ""High-Street"" Questions

*Once your foundations are set, you need to start providing value. Content in 2025 isn't about keyword stuffing; it’s about Semantic Search. When a user in Birmingham types ""how much does a loft conversion cost?"", they aren't just looking for a price; they are looking for a trusted expert who understands UK building regulations and local costs.*

*This is where your blog becomes your most potent weapon. Don't write generic articles. Write ""Inside Baseball"" content that addresses the specific anxieties of a UK consumer. Mention GDPR compliance, talk about the ""Cost of Living"" impact on your industry, or explain how your service handles the unpredictable British weather. This level of nuance makes your content feel human and trustworthy.*

# Leveraging Social Proof and Q&A Platforms

*UK consumers are notoriously skeptical. We don't like ""hard sells."" We like recommendations from people like us. Integrating a* [*UK local services Q&A platform*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#) *into your strategy allows you to demonstrate expertise without being ""pushy."" By answering common queries, you aren't just helping one person; you’re creating a permanent, searchable asset that proves you know your stuff.*

*Think of it as the digital equivalent of being the person everyone asks for advice at the local Chamber of Commerce meeting. Every answered question is a beacon of visibility. Furthermore, keeping an eye on* [*UK local business marketing tips*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#) *can give you the edge on what topics are currently trending in the British SME space.*

# Try This Tomorrow:

*Find three questions customers asked you this week. Write a 300-word answer for each and post them as a ""FAQ"" section on your service pages. Use standard UK English (e.g., ""Specialise"" not ""Specialize"") to maintain local relevance.*

# Days 21-30: The Conversion Sprint and Performance Tuning

*You’ve built the foundation and started the conversation. Now, you need to ensure that the people finding you actually pick up the phone or click ""Book Now."" This stage is about ""UX Architecture""—making sure your site is faster than a London cabbie on a quiet Sunday. With the 2024 Google Core Update still echoing, page speed and mobile responsiveness are non-negotiable for UK businesses.*

*Beyond technicalities, look at your ""Call to Action"" (CTA). Is it clear? Does it respect the user’s journey? Sometimes, the most effective* [*UK business marketing solutions*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#) *are the simplest ones: a visible phone number, a ""Request a Quote"" button that works on mobile, and a clear list of the areas you serve (e.g., ""Serving Greater Manchester and Cheshire"").*

# Refining Your Reputation and Reviews

*In the final ten days, go on a review offensive. Reach out to your best clients from the last six months and ask for a specific review. Don't just ask for ""five stars."" Ask them to mention the service they had and the location. ""John did a great job on our boiler in Leeds"" is worth ten ""Great service!"" reviews because it contains those vital semantic signals: Service + Location + Sentiment.*

***When This Might Not Work:*** *If your industry is hyper-competitive (think London Personal Injury Lawyers or Nationwide Insurance), a 30-day ""organic only"" push won't put you at #1. In these cases, you’ll need to supplement this blueprint with a targeted PPC (Pay-Per-Click) campaign or a more aggressive* [*UK lead generation services*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#) *strategy.*

# The Definitive FAQ: Dominating the UK Digital Landscape

*1. How long does it really take to see results from Local SEO in the UK?*

However, you can often see ""quick wins"" in Map rankings within the first 14-21 days of optimizing your GBP and securing a* [*small business free listing UK*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#)*.*

*2. Is it worth paying for directory listings?*

*In most cases, start with a high-quality* [*free local business listing UK*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#)*. Only pay for ""premium"" listings if the directory has high domain authority and specifically targets your niche or local area.*

*3. Does GDPR affect my online visibility?*

*Indirectly, yes. Google prioritizes sites that are secure and respect user privacy. Ensure your SSL certificate is valid and your Privacy Policy is up to date with UK GDPR standards.*

*4. What is the most important ""Trust Signal"" for a UK business?*

*A consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across the web and a verified presence in a* [*UK local business directory*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#)*. These prove to search engines that you are a legitimate entity.*

*5. Can I rank in cities where I don't have a physical office?*

*It's harder, but possible. You need to create specific ""Service Area"" pages on your website and secure mentions in* [*UK local services listings*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#) *that cover those broader regions.*

*6. How is ""Voice Search"" changing UK local rankings?*

*British users are increasingly using Siri or Alexa with conversational phrasing like ""Where is the best roast dinner near me?"".

*Always respond professionally. Never ignore it. For fake reviews, report them to the platform. Proactive* [*reputation management UK businesses*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#) *involves drowning out the occasional negative comment with a flood of genuine, positive feedback from your happy customers.*

*8. Is Apple Maps relevant for my UK-based business?*

*Absolutely. With high iPhone market share in the UK, being visible on Apple Maps is crucial for mobile users. Ensure your business is listed accurately on ""Apple Business Connect"" to capture this traffic.*

*9. Does video content help my local visibility?*

*Yes. Short-form videos (Reels, TikToks, or YouTube Shorts) showing you at work in local UK landmarks or job sites provide powerful visual evidence of your local presence and can be embedded in your GBP updates.*

*10. Should I blog about local UK events to help SEO?*

*Only if it's relevant to your business. Writing about the ""Great North Run"" if you’re a sports physio in Newcastle is brilliant; doing it as a plumber in London is less effective. Keep your hyper-local content aligned with your service area.*

*11. How do I get high-quality backlinks as an SME?*

*The best backlinks come from local news sites, sponsorships of local youth teams, and being featured in a* [*UK verified business listings*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#) *hub. This signals to Google that you are an integral part of your local community.*

*12. Does my Companies House data need to match my website?*

*Ideally, yes. While you can trade under a different name, keeping your legal address consistent with your business location across directories helps reinforce your legitimacy to search algorithms.*

*13. What is ""Hyper-Local"" marketing in the UK context?*

*It’s focusing on specific wards or postcodes (e.g., SE1, M4) rather than just a city. Using* [*UK local business search*](blob:https://4xm2g5qv88u2mpsxvmhcmk4p43z8iveqjbx54m0t957782wj9v-h845251650.scf.usercontent.goog/91239f52-df4e-443f-99ef-6bf8782973a7#) *tactics to target these smaller areas can often result in much higher conversion rates.*

First a bit from “MY Fantasy Life” (cred: Eigenstien) or, as BlancheFromage suspects, “one of the many fake characters within the SGI-RV fantasy scenario created by a lonely, low-income, isolated, cult-addicted, mentally-ill elderly woman.”

*Woke up super early to help Dee get ready for Sleepover Breakfast. We got globs of hot porridge ready for everyone, urns of coffee and tea, flatbreads from locally grown and milled flour, platters of smoked fish, jams, honey, and bacon will be coming out soon. A meal fit for Sam Gribley.*

*I’m back in the RV to take care of the kids and one young ACS friend who woke up thinking she was in the Magic Kingdom. Outside all the children, parents, and staff have snacked and are getting ready for Track/Swimming/Perimeter Walk exercising.*

*All of the kids opted to sleep out under open skies in 20-degree weather. They are bundled up in heavy socks, layers of clothes, and hats. But Eulogio surprised everyone with one of his secrets that even WE didn’t know about. In anticipation of winter sleepovers, he bought out the entire remaining stock of 2025 “Feathered Friends Snowbunting ES 0 Degree” sleeping bags with each student’s name tagged. It’s adult-sized so the children had to stuff it with a blanket. I think they were more excited about the sleeping bags than anything else!*

*Sorry, bags for children only. Our poor parents managed the best they could with whatever they had brought!*

*Yesterday night we had for the parents the final Longhouse Elem Debate on whether Chef Dee should serve sparrow meat in her stews. I am sure Teacher Lolita will want to tell the story herself in her own way.* 

*But moving outside of the structure of formal debates, in the end, the sentiment had swung toward including house sparrows in the diet. But it was by no means a consensus but at least the it was well-informed and reason-bound disagreements.. The People of the Longhouse have a long tradition of decision-making by consensus. The conversation has to go on until a consensus is reached. That doesn’t mean everyone has to be in full support of the decision. However, the final decision has to be at least something that everyone can live with. Maybe they will get to that point before we close the sleepover in a couple of hours. But it has been a great learning experience about decision-making.*

Today I complete the second section, [Buddhahood: A Life State in Which Struggles Themselves Are a Source of Joy](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/enjoying-inﬁnite-beneﬁt-through-out-eternity-the-boundless-joy-of-a-life-of-unceasing-challenge-based-on-the-mystic-law/), in the December *Living Buddhism* installment of Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture on “The Opening of the Eyes.” 

Dr. Ikeda states:

>These courageous Bodhisattvas of the Earth, champions of kosen-rufu, have established a state of absolute freedom across past, present and future, based on the Mystic Law that permeates the life of the universe, as described by the passage “Passing through the round of births and deaths, one makes one’s way on the land of the Dharma nature, or enlightenment, that is inherent within oneself” (The Record of the Orally Trasmitted Teachings, p. 52). This describes the truly eternal life span of the Buddha. The Japanese term for life span is *juryo*, which the Daishonin explains literally means “an overall reckoning” (OTT, 123)—in other words, an overall reckoning of the immeasurable benefit that Buddhas possess. Ultimately, without an indomitable fighting spirit, it is not possible to gain this immense benefit of eternally indestructible joy. 

Dee has shown everyone what “an indomitable fighting spirit” is like. She had felt completely deflated because her personal efforts to tie together a group of women from Ukraine, Russia, Israel, and Palestine who were suffering from the wars. Governments felt threatened by cross-national friendships. Perhaps the specter of united women demanding peace was much too much for the powers-to-be. But Dee is now Chef Dee who is acclimatizing 25 students to pre-European Invasion food gathering and cooking. She was the one who started this gigantic unit about House Sparrows by making an innocuous comments about cooking some up in front of Lori that snowballed into what we see outside our window right now. *Juryo* is this eternal precious moment.

Now, I can’t claim that I precisely know what “this immense benefit of eternally indestructible joy” is but I think it is right there. A Saturday morning, after a sleepover in 20-degree temperatures, gathering at 7:00 am to run a couple of miles as if it’s incomprehensible that there are people who don’t do this. And there are their parents run/walking behind the pack of brave Indigenous children from 500 years ago.

Dr. Ikeda concludes the section:

>The Soka Gakkai’s brilliant 75-year history [95 in 2025] has been one of enabling countless ordinary people to attain Buddhahood in their present form. This triumphant legacy will shine forever in the annals of Buddhism.

So let me give you a back story as to how my relationship has been and how I am so that you can decide whether I’m just overly sensitive or right in feeling the way I do.

My husband and I have very different personalities and were raised very different. He was raised to think about himself over others while I was raised to help others. For example, he will never volunteer because he gets nothing out of it, he has said this himself. He also doesn’t really have empathy towards others. He only understands what he is going through and feels that he deserves more than he actually works for. His parent give him everything. To this day they continue to do huge things for him. This includes me as well but I would rather struggle and work for our things because I know that we tried and got something through our own strength and effort. His parents just gave us a car because we needed a safer car for winter driving. This is a very new and expensive car that belonged to his mom and she loved. She just signed it over to him. About 3 years ago they had given us an old car of theirs as well so that we could have two vehicles. 

I am benefiting from these things but I would rather go without because it makes him feel entitled. He didn’t go to college but thinks he should get paid more at his job and is smarter than everyone there. 

He also thinks I am at fault every time we have a fight. One example is when I was severely depressed from moving across the country away from my family and I was left to take care of our two young girls and everything at home. I had no friends, no car and no help. I also had to make very complicated meals for his lunch, have dinner ready and served for when he got home at 3 am and keep my girls quiet until he got up at 1 in the afternoon. Keep in mind my girls were 3 and almost 2, we lived in a 1,000 sq ft apartment that we didn’t get to leave unless I walked and pushed them in their stroller after he left to work with our only car. (I had a car but he made me sell it before we moved away). 
Anyway, most days I had a lot to deal with and after taking care of everything, making him lunch from scratch and getting my girls to bed I still had to make sure I made a dinner that he would like. He wouldn’t just eat what I made for us girls. So I’d stay up till midnight cooking and be up through the night taking care of our youngest type 1 diabetic daughter  then get up and take care of them both alone again. 

At times I wouldn’t make exactly what he wanted or there would be leftovers and not plated food but there was always an option to eat something substantial. He would get mad at me and make me feel worthless. He did it so much I got more and more depressed. He told me i needed to talk to someone and he blamed my depression on our kids. When I wanted to visit my family he got mad because I wouldn’t  ask my family to just drive us around everywhere even if we had our own car because he was afraid that with our license plates being from another state we would get robbed. He yelled at me and told me to leave back to California but I couldn’t take the kids. 

I have become very forgetful and I make a lot of mistakes. To him they’re big mistakes that call for him to make me feel like I need to change who I am. 
I lost a credit card and he still reminds me to this day. He laughs when I say I’m capable of doing things and he has always put down the work that I want to do. I wanted to do bookkeeping and he said it wasn’t worth it. I wanted to do transcribing and he said I wouldn’t be able to do enough to make enough money. I wanted to work and he said I had to take care of our girls and I could only work if his mom stayed with us to help. 

He never felt bad missing his family because he only cares about his mom and she basically lives with us half the year. 

We bought a house (again with his parent’s help and our savings) and we have a guest room that is half his mom’s room and half guest room. It’s supposed to be a guest room but his mom has her things in there and has even put up her grandkids pictures and things she’s been given. She has basically taken it over. This is fine as she really does deserve it. My only problem is that when my family has come to visit it has been an issue with having them sleep in that room. I specifically told him before we took his parent’s help that the room would be for his mom but also a guest room. 

Now my dad is visiting for the first time in 6 years (his mom is here 3 months at a time and done about twice a year). I had told my husband that my dad would take the guest room while his mom is at his sister’s house. This way I’m not just kicking her out. I felt this was a fair way to do it and he didn’t say no. In fact I remember him agreeing but now I’m not so sure. To get to the point finally, he decided that he would sleep in that room while his mom is gone. He put out girls in our room and said my dad could sleep in one of their rooms while our girls sleep with me in the master bedroom. Oh yeah he also doesn’t sleep next to me because he says our bed is too hard, I toss and turn too much and wake him and our girls come in when they’re scared and wake him and he needs his sleep. 

He also got mad at me for giving my dad our toothpaste (in hindsight I guess I should have looked for a new one for sanitary reasons) but I didn’t. He told me he didn’t think it was right that my dad had to share our germs and he didn’t want my dad’s germs. He said he wouldn’t share toothpaste with his mom either but get this, I see his toothbrush in the bathroom next to the guest room and her toothpaste is there. He hasn’t come to our room to use our bow brand new toothpaste and so I tell him oh do you need to get the toothpaste from our room and he says no why. I tell him well your mom’s toothpaste is the one that’s there so have you already brushed your teeth. He says sometimes I just don’t use toothpaste at night when I brush. Then I said but you said you do that in the morning sometimes so do you just not use toothpaste? He said it just happens that way sometimes.

Recently he also made me feel horrible about wanting to go on a trip to see my friends. I mean this is a big trip and it would be costly. He hasn’t expressed his dislike for Britain because I used to live there with an ex. I have very bad memories there but also very good ones and I have grown to just focus on the good. He got mad that I wanted to go on my own and when on and on about how he never wants to do anything without me but I’m always trying to do things without him. I didn’t want to go without my family but I really want to see my friends again and it would be too costly for all of us to go. I figured if I went for under a week I could work a second job to save up and finally see my friends again. He told my girls I wanted to leave them which made them cry. I mean I have seen moms go on trips, it doesn’t mean they hate their family. I don’t do anything for myself aside from buy a coffee here and there and color my own hair with boxed dye. 

He tells me that I stress him out and I’m the cause of his stress outside of work. I just don’t see how but I wish I could record our lives so that people could tell me if I’m doing things wrong.  

Am I really actually selfish? Am I such a screw up that I cause stress in our family because i volunteer and don’t cook a meal one day at home? 

Honestly I feel like if I sound like I’m just saying bad things about him and not enough about me I can add more but I felt this was a good place to start.

There is no debate about the weight loss anymore.

But after watching friends and community members run them for over a year i started noticing a pattern that nobody talks about in the commercials.

The problem is not the weight loss it is what gets lost along with the fat.

Here are the quiet side effects that show up after the honeymoon phase ends.

**1. The flatline in mood**

When you suppress the hunger signal you often suppress the reward signal too.

People tell me they just don't get excited about things anymore.

Coffee doesn't hit the same.

A good meal doesn't feel rewarding.

Even the gym feels like a chore instead of a release.

It is a subtle form of anhedonia where life just feels a little grey.

**2. The protein math stops working**

Most people simply stop eating enough volume to maintain muscle.

They lose twenty pounds on the scale but five of it is lean tissue.

They end up smaller but softer and weaker.

Recovery tanks because the body doesn't have the amino acids to repair itself after a workout.

**3. Digestion slows to a crawl**

This usually hits around month three or four.

Food sits in the stomach for hours.

Bloating becomes a daily issue even with small meals.

It turns eating into a source of anxiety rather than fuel.

**4. Stimulants become unpredictable**

Because digestion is slower caffeine hits differently.

Sometimes it feels like it does nothing and other times it hits you all at once four hours later.

Pre workouts that used to be fine suddenly cause nausea or anxiety spikes.

**The honest reality**

These drugs are powerful tools but they are not free rides.

The trade off for effortless weight loss is often a loss of drive and muscle density.

If you are going this route you have to treat your nutrition like a prescription.

You have to force the protein and the resistance training or you will end up skinny fat and tired.

Many people misunderstand what a haunted house is and even more people live their lives completely oblivious, blissfully so in my opinion, at how often they came in direct contact with them. Because you see, what is usually miscategorised as a haunting is in reality a living organism. I talked about Mimics before and how they slip into our reality to occupy familiar spaces but I never shared the tale of my first encounter with them.

It was my first home actually. The first place I could proudly claim as my own, sort of. It was gifted to me via inheritance but it was mine. This house had good bones and saw three generations of my family get brought up under its roof but I hadn’t seen it in years. Like most young, brave, hungry youths, soon as I saw my chance to strive out into the wide world I took it. I was absolutely convinced I’d find something amazing to enrich my life out there which was missing in my hometown. This may sound like I regretted my decisions but that’s not the case.

However, I will be the first to admit that maybe I should have slowed my horses and ventured with a better plan…and a fuller pocket. I lasted as long as I could but eventually the memory of three satiating meals a day without the constant fear of rising rent, siren called me back to my roots. Sadly, before I could boomerang back, tragedy struck and I inherited the house. Such is the way of life but it still bitch slaps you sometimes, especially when it almost feels like something’s trying to mess with your plans deliberately. It’s been a while and I’m no longer grieving but the sting never disappears completely.

Either way, I inherited the house and with it the complete decimation of what I always assumed was reality. Do you know that Matrix scene with the red and blue pill? This house was my red pill. To give you a brief description of the place so you can imagine it. The house was cosy with two floored and three bedrooms. It sounds fancy but one of the bedroom s was a renovated bathroom so it was fairly tight. Also, my room growing up but it was a good home. It was warm in winter and we had a small but pretty garden at the back. For some ungodly reason I never understood, my mother decided yellow was a good colour to dress the outside with because she always had a soft spot for sunflowers. Not my flavour but it also wasn’t my property at the time.

I had a mixed bag of emotions when I finally returned to my home and I dragged my feet as long as socially acceptable but eventually I had to put on my big girl boots and get on with it. The nostalgia hit first, then the sorrow when I remembered there would be no warm greeting when I opened the front door. The house was empty but well looked after. It had an occupant until very recently after all. The striking red walls were...

Wait… Did someone repaint the place before I arrived? I remember thinking back but I couldn’t recall any pictures of the outside sent recently so it wasn’t crazy to imagine my mother got bored of the yellow at some point. We kept in contact but maybe this wasn’t information worth sharing. Honestly, I liked the red better. It helped ease the heavy weight of returning to familiar grounds. I wondered if the inside changed as well. I hoped so. The thought of being surrounded by childhood reminders of a shared past with someone gone was justifiably daunting.

The inside was different but the same. It was a strange feeling. I’d reach for a plate and know which shelf to open but then get disorientated when the mug wasn’t blue but green. Obviously, it was silly to assume the house innards remained frozen in my past but it was still odd. I’ve also never been alone in the place before and that was unsettling. The house wasn’t creepy at all but the lack of another person’s noises had my skin pinpricking during the night. When the house breathed, it made me startle because I kept listening for my mother’s footsteps while she went to make herself some tea or a door close or her snoring. But of course, there was nobody else there.

The real oddities didn’t happen straight away. Maybe the house was letting me get into a routine and a false sense of security. Maybe it wasn’t hungry yet. I couldn’t tell you but when the madness started, it came fast and I was settled enough to assume most of it was inside my head for far too long.

I remember noticing things were getting moved around, but only small things. Things I used on the daily and had a routine of putting in certain spots but then finding them elsewhere. It was never a crazy spot either so I assumed I just dropped the items while distracted. For example I always reflexively put my car keys in a bowl by the front entrance. You do that every time you go out, it becomes thoughtless. But sometimes I’d find the keys on the table or kitchen counter. Nothing insane, right? I agree but it happened often enough to make me notice. And I remember making an effort to put the keys in the bowl to still find them somewhere else. That’s when the displacement started feeling less innocent but still miles from something worth running screaming for the hill.

Then the food started spoiling but somehow I never noticed until I ate it. I lived alone and pretty frugally since this return home was an attempt to re-inflate my pockets. The world set me back but I wasn’t beaten down enough yet to settle for my home town. I miss that youthful energy sometimes… Stupid but fun. Either way, this money saving mentality meant I wasn’t cavalier with my food. I bought what I needed and kept my fridge stocked. Leftovers were saved and consumed later. I wasn’t denying myself by any means but simply being responsible. This is all to say, I was aware of what was in my fridge. To be so spaced out that food consistently rotted was extremely unlikely.

On many occasions I recall making dinner, setting out the plates and tucking in. I swear it looked appetising. I distinctly recall cooking pork neck once and it was everything your belly’s rumbling for. The smell was nowhere near gone off, the colour was fresh and pink, the juice was flowing and when I took the first anticipated bite… so sour I retched. Not only was this piece of meat expired but it was so far gone it should be swimming in maggots. I couldn’t comprehend how I managed to cook, plate and sit to eat the meal before realizing. It was crazy!

And then it happened again. And again. I’d check the expiry date on milk, sniff it just to double check and pour it on cereal. Acrid. I’d reach for an onion to peel. It was firm in my hand until I place did on the cutting board and my fingers pushed right through the soggy bulb. How? How was it possible for something to change their entire physical attribute from the cupboard to the counter? It defied logic. And I should have left but how many of you would abandon a house when your bank account can’t sustain it because some food turned freaky? It’s not always that easy to do the smart thing.

Somehow I pulled through for the first season. There were times when I half packed but talked myself out of it because it was crazy to basically go homeless because somethings were ‘weird’. Always listen to that voice inside your head. I was lucky and my disregard didn’t end up with dire consequences but there were so many red flags…

My cat ran away. He never ventured outside and was a complete homebody but one day he just darted out the front door like his tail was set on fire. I’m happy to say he’s fine. He returned a few nights later but no matter how much I enticed him or coerced him, no matter what treats and toys I bought, he refused categorically to re-enter the threshold. If I brought him in forcefully, he went through such a tantrum I was genuinely afraid he’d hurt himself to get out. Animals don’t behave like this. Animals also don’t rationalize things around them so maybe J. saw something I didn’t…

Plants never survived a day. I’d buy those guaranteed ‘unkillable’ beginner greens like snake plants to add a little life to the place. I’ve had them before and forgot about them…for months. They genuinely are as close to human proof as plants can get. Sadly I think I found their kryptonite. Not one, not a single one survived overnight. I kept buying because I assumed the shop overwatered them or they had a disease from the nursery but it kept happening. Any bouquet I placed in a vase or potted herb I bought for a roast. Even the most casual plant enthusiast can plop a bunch of cut flowers in water and expect them to live for a few days. On its own it might have been ignored but all those small things were adding up, finally.

I naturally talked to some of my family about the strangeness and the responses were exactly what you can imagine. I’m surprised they didn’t laugh me out the door. To be clear, they were not unkind but they also didn’t think I was being serious. To ease my mind a few even stayed over for a while and wouldn’t you guess it? Nothing weird happened. I remember stupidly crying when the food tasted fine. It wasn’t always off but I learned to expect a trap if something was left under that roof for more than a few hours. I was almost hoping it’d happen when my cousin joined me for dinner just so I can say, ‘See? I’m not nuts!’. No dice. I was starting to get the eerie feeling this house was toying with me. It was ridiculous but how else could I explain this shift in attitude? Or, I was indeed nuts but I wasn’t ready to consider that yet. 

This gave me the idea of seeking out a roommate. It was the smart thing to do anyway, if saving was still my priority. The house was big enough for a family and way more space than I needed for myself. Plus, I couldn’t deny I was looking forwards to some companionship. This house never got warmer for me. That desolation twisting around my ankles when I first returned never really went away and after J. permanently moved out to the backyard, I was all alone. A roommate could be just the thing to snap me out of this sombre mind-set.

There was one friend I knew hoped to move out soon but in this economy, easier said than done. For the sake of the story, I’ll call her Eva. We knew each other when we were young but lost touch when I moved away but an easy friendship resumed when we reunited. She was just one of those easy people to talk to and I trusted her enough not to be worried about sleeping with her in the house. So I asked her if she’d like to move in, share the costs and get through winter together. Eva practically moved in before I punctuated the question.

Once again, the house seemed settled when Eva moved in. Nothing unusual happened. J. continued staying outside but plants actually survived and objects stayed in their place. More evidence for me to turn everything I ‘knew’ happened and question if it really had. I mean, unless I was ready to accept a reality where this inanimate object had a consciousness I had to concede the far likelier possibility I had a mental break from stress and loss. The brain is a phenomenal machine but it’s a scary thing if it breaks… Life had been tough and the rationality beast was getting fed again.

When I moved in it, was mid-Autumn and now we were feeling the prick of Father Winter’s wind. I recall dreading spending the holidays in that sepulchre of a home but with Eva, things were looking far merrier. We had a good time. Nothing crazy but there’s no accounting for the simple comfort of having someone to share a coffee with in the morning. Maybe the house was taking its time until Eva got comfortable before picking up its freaky mind games again? It did something similar when I moved in…

The first sign of bad times was in the shift of objects again. I pointed it out to Eva once but she said nothing like that happened to her and I was too worried of sending her screaming so I didn’t insist on it. It was only small things after all. I wasn’t ready to lose a friend because some keys decided to grow legs and migrate from the front door bowl to the kitchen counter.

One night I noticed the windows on the second floor changed. It was so odd I think I chuckled a little. I know, as sure as my eyes are brown, that this house had six windows in total on the second floor (including the bathrooms and bedrooms). One of my chores growing up was to help mom clean them and I hated it so trust me, I was intimately familiar with their number. But one night there were seven. I counted and re-counted but there was definitely one more window on the hallway than before. It looked and acted normal enough but it shouldn’t have been there.

I was unnerved but what could I do? I hoped it was all in my head and Eva didn’t say anything so I slept on it. The next day, there were five windows. The cold dread I experienced when I moved through the upstairs rooms and counted all the windows… I took pictures with my phone to make sure I’d have evidence if they shifted again. Then I could show Eva. I was still anxious about her leaving but the need to not be crazy was rapidly overtaking everything else.

It was almost a victory when the following day the number changed to six again. I took the pictures, counted four times to make sure I had the correct number and told Eva. She looked at me oddly. And I don’t expect my frantic justification made me seem any less insane. But it was ok. I had my physical evidence and I confidently pulled out my phone to show her. Today there were six windows, we even went upstairs and counted them together so I expected a look of unnerved confusion when I’d show Eva the five from the previous day. I showed her and we counted together. Six.

That odd look morphed to pity but I kept explaining myself in that way people backed into a corner do. The more I talked the more she altered her tone and body language to settle down a manic individual. I stopped when I saw my reflection in the black phone screen. I looked crazy and Eva was carefully stepping back. Somehow I convinced her it was all a prank but that easiness between us never returned. She must have seen something in my desperation to prove my tale which was too sincere to be conveniently explained away as make-belief. But I guessed she was doing what I did to justify staying. She rationalised. Now I was just her crazy roommate but as long as I wasn’t dangerous it wasn’t bad enough to move out.

Another week passed. I kept trying to get J. into the house since it was getting crisp out there but even that didn’t sway the fur ball. Instead I piled a bunch of blankets to make sure he kept warm and hoped for the best. The little guy looked healthy and a trip to the vet gave him a clean bill so maybe the outside suited him. He was certainly looking better than me…

Eva kept more to herself now and she didn’t share a cup of coffee in the morning anymore. I lamented the loss but I couldn’t turn back the clock. I should have kept my mouth shut and ignored the house’s antics. The windows were still changing but I was starting to get it. The damned thing was fucking with my head or Eva was keeping her mouth superglued shut. Everything I started thinking was in my head began happening again. Food tasted rancid, plants died, objects swapped at random and it was even worse because Eva never reacted. Was she seeing none of this?! Was she not tasting the same repulsive meat I was?! I was staring at the withered, straw like husks of a store bought bouquet of roses and Eva leaned down to sniff them, smiling as if they were fragrant! Things made less sense than ever and now I was starting to doubt what I was seeing with my own two eyeballs as well. And my anxiety was clearly showing because Eva was getting increasingly weary of my presence.

I’m honestly surprised she stayed as long as she did. Eva moved out before Christmas and I’ll never forget what she told me. She was never unkind but I was obviously setting her nerves on edge. She told me to get help and I just started laughing. No mirth just frayed nerves. I expect she’ll never get in contact with me again and I was just her once friend, now certifiable roommate. I wonder what her stories about me sounded like? I wonder what I looked like through her eyes? I will never know because I was too scared to find out. Judging from the concerned phone calls and house visits from my cousin, I expect ‘crazy’ was tossed around a few times.

The best thing to come out of Eva’s stay was sense finally starting to crack through my ‘rationalization'. Something was definitely off about this place. Or maybe I was indeed crazy but if so then this fucking house was not helping. I wanted out. My mind was made up to wait out the rest of Winter and permanently say goodbye to my childhood home. Whatever happened between then and now, it became impossible for me to keep the nostalgia tinted glasses on anymore.

Maybe it was stupid lingering. Scratch that, it was most assuredly stupid but I just couldn’t find something within my price range right away. Everything is marked up during this yearly time ‘of giving’ and as mentally drained as I was, I hoped to also survive out there. Surely I could ride out another few weeks. And yes, I did reach out to family to see if they could spare a couch for a few weeks but they all had full houses. I also got the sense my cousin, with his young kids, danced around the subject like he was a gold medallist. He was clearly uneasy about someone who displayed some sort of manic episode around his family and I can hardly fault him for being a responsible father. I was family but so were they and I would have done the same.

The house didn’t up the ante for a while but one night I started hearing something new. That was never a good sign between those walls. I resolved to ignore it but it just got louder and closer. Tapping and scratching. Like finger nails hitting the windows and critters scurrying between the walls. Being alone in the dark with those inexplicable noises taught me the meaning of fear. I think the house was getting pissed that I stopped reacting to all the mean tricks. When I did my best to block the noises, they got so loud and close I could have sworn a swarm of rats would flood into the bedroom. It was demanding my focus and it was almost as if the noise was coming from inside my skull. The tapping and scratching wasn’t on the windows, but on my bones. Impossible to escape something so insidious.

Maybe the house was getting bored with the chipping at my sanity and decided to go all in. But it was smarter than you think. If it did something so brazen from the start do you think I could have rationalised it? Hell no. I’d have noped the hell out immediately but this thing started turning up the heat to a boil slowly so I didn’t realize I was cooking for a long time.

This was the last thing I clearly recall of my childhood home. I couldn’t take the noises anymore so I screeched like a banshee and charged the basement. In my head, I felt like that was the source of the noise. Why? I couldn’t tell you and all I saw was a red mist. I just wanted something to attack, something to hurt and blame. I hoped there would be rodents for me to step on.

In the few minutes it took me to stomp down the stairs and bang the basement door open, the clamour in my head was so loud I thought my ears were bleeding. And of course when I got there, it all suddenly stopped. I had given the narcissistic house the attention it craved so it was done with me. I couldn’t take this whiplash anymore. Walking through the terribly normal room at the bottom of the steps was nauseating. All I’d dared want was to save some money and I guess it’s true what they say about nothing being free. The price was my sanity and it just wasn’t fair. Why me?

I remember crying in the dark but of course there was no answer or sudden epiphany. I don’t think this had something to do with me per se. I was just the fool unlucky enough to step inside this cursed creatures of brick and mortar. Had my mother felt this? I didn’t think so surely she wouldn’t have condiment me to this hell knowingly. That contradicted the memory of her far too much for me to entertain it. But then again, would anyone seeing me now recognise me? My mother lived in this home alone for years…

Before I meandered more twisting, unanswerable questions, something bit me. The pinch snapped me out of my dark thoughts as effectively as a slap across the face and I looked at my ankle to see the bleeding indents of a circular bite. I looked for rats but couldn’t see anything and heard nothing but I certainly got out of there before that changed. The wound was small but a bleeder. The house was officially turning violent and that was it. It didn’t matter if I had to drain my resources, I had to get out.

I didn’t wait for the next day. I found a hotel and got out. I tossed some clothes in a suitcase, cajoled a cry-baby J. into his carrier and got into my car. For once the keys were in the bowl. Of course I had to return to get the rest of my stuff but I managed to beg hard enough to arouse my cousin’s pity and he accompanied me the next day to fetch my things. No way I had the spine to go back in alone and while he thought I was unhinged, he agreed something clearly disturbed me while staying there and moving out was a smart choice.

I now know a lot more about those imposter creatures I called Mimics along the way. There’s no such thing as haunted houses in the traditional sense but a vacant home is a tasty option for one of those things. There’s always signs when those pretenders slip into the form of something. They can’t perfectly recreate something so if you pay attention you’ll see a change in wall colour, or one too many windows, or an obvious change in space. And they almost always pick things familiar to you so you can see the changes. That’s the whole point. Mimics feed on your sanity but if they can’t mess with your mind then what’s the point. Sure, they can and have ‘haunted’ new occupants but that’s way more effort and why bother when there’s plenty of easier prey?

Like I said at the start, your house is not haunted. It’s trying to eat you and sometimes it feels like sharing. Mimics can’t hurt you physically, that is a fact I learned through much effort. So…why do I have a scar on my ankle?",1,1766233505.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Basically what do you think ?","**CHAPTER 1**

I was twenty-three years old, and my life was a fucking disaster. Every bad decision, every lie, every stolen naggin of cheap vodka had landed me here: about to be admitted into what was basically a feckin’ Magdalene Laundry for generational fuck-ups. I felt half-arsedly suicidal, disoriented, teetering on the edge of full-blown DTs. I was truly on my bollix. But I still had the essentials: my denial and the beautiful, delusional arrogance that came with it.

The long hall was floored with hard brown industrial lino — that misery-coloured shite designed to depress anyone unlucky enough to stand on it. The smell of stale farts, piss, and chemical cleaner was noxious. The place felt like a prison hospital crossed with an auld one’s sitting room — the type with ancient biscuit tins full of sewing needles, loose buttons, and stale Murray Mints. Yellowing floral wallpaper drowned the walls, plastered with Holy Marys, nativity scenes, and little plaques spouting shite like *He is a Father of Second Chances* and *Let Go, Let God*. Almost directly in front of me, the Sacred Heart of Jesus glared down accusingly.

*Bejaysus, Liam — you’ve really made a balls of yourself this time, son.*

Looking at the big fella gave me an idea. Maybe I could be like your man from *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest* — an alcoholic Messiah on a mission of Grace.

But like I said already: I was delusional.

I was standing just outside the dreaded Nurses’ Station — the central hub of the Star of the Sea Treatment Centre for people in crisis addiction. Was my addiction a crisis? Not sure. Maybe I just needed a girlfriend. But my legal troubles and living situation certainly were. A severe-looking woman in her fifties — a nun, I presumed — was off fetching the pajamas I’d be stuck in for detox week.

She left me with my addled thoughts, and I felt like a condemned man waiting to be led away — too terrified to sit, too cowardly to wander. I stared at the lino, eyes like saucers, praying she’d hurry back.

A fella who looked like he’d been through the wars appeared, shuffling up the hall toward me. Sixties-looking, though probably only early fifties. Psoriasis scarred his arms in angry blotches, and a huge Freddie Mercury mustache dominated his alcohol-ravaged face. He clutched a cup of tea in both hands, trembling so violently he was spilling it everywhere.

Was this me in a few blacked-out years if I didn’t cop on? Surely not. This lad was a true dipso. I just needed a job and a bit of direction. I could probably even still smoke a joint or two if I made it out of here alive.

He stopped beside me, paused, sized me up, and in a surprisingly gentle Northside accent asked:

“Are ya goin’ to be stayin’ with us, son?”

I nodded and rolled my eyes heavenward. “For me sins, bud.” I was trying to pull off the strong-silent-type until I got my bearings.

He glanced at the trail of tea behind him, then nodded at a door marked *Sitting Room*. “Sorry, son… would ya open that aul door quick before she gets back? She’ll bleedin’ kill me if she sees I’ve dripped this everywhere.”

“No bothers, bud.”

I pushed open the door, half-bracing for a Mountjoy holding cell. If these lads thought I was a soft touch, I’d be watching my back in the showers for ninety-odd days.

Instead, I was both startled and relieved to find a warm, cosy sitting room. A massive fireplace blazed with turf. A bookshelf in the corner was filled with — of all things — 1970s Mills & Boon romances.

“Lads, we’ve a new guest — be on yer best behaviour now,” my new mate announced with a wink, plonking himself into an ancient armchair and spilling even more tea.

Two fragile-looking old fellas at the rain-battered window looked up from their Connect Four game and smiled. Another sullen ginger lad in his thirties sat alone on a worn couch, nodding at me half-heartedly with jaundiced, anxious eyes before bending back to a massive jigsaw of *The Gladiators* — not the Romans, the feckin’ 90s TV show with Jet and Wolf.

One of the Connect Four lads — late sixties, grey hair but well groomed — stood up and declared in a Southside accent:

“You’re fucked now, kiddo. Welcome to the club.”

He held out his hand. “I’m Eugene. This West Cork eejit I’m thrashin’ is Eddie. Our quiet friend here is Phillip.”

Phillip didn’t look up from hunting a missing piece of Jet’s tits.

“You’ve already met Anto. He loves his tea. We’ll have to get ya a straw, Anto.”

Anywhere else it could’ve been a piss-take, but Eugene said it with genuine concern.

“Ah Jaysus, Eugene, I’m in a bleedin’ jock. Can’t wait for the aul night meds,” Anto muttered, collapsing deeper into the chair by the fire.

Watching him shake made me sweat. Dread for my own rattle crept in fast. I prayed the nun would be liberal with the Xanax.

As if on cue: “Oh for God’s sake!”

Her footsteps slapped the lino like machine-gun bursts. Her head popped around the door — sharp eyes, glasses slipping, scanning the room like an angry robin before locking onto Anto.

“Anthony O’Grady,” she chastised in a thick Cork accent. “How many times have you been here? You know full well you’re not allowed to drink in here.”

“I’m very sorry, Margaret,” Anto said meekly. “It’s bleedin’ cold outside. I just wanted a nice tea by the fire.”

“It’s not *by* the fire though, Anthony, is it? No — it’s all over the hall and on the carpet.” She huffed. “I’ve better things to be doing than cleaning up tea.”

But when she looked at his trembling hands, something softened. She reached into her cardigan and dropped two Librium capsules into his cup. She placed a hand on his greying hair and lifted the drink to his lips.

“Now, silly Billy, drink that down like a good man.”

Anto’s eyes welled. “Ah thanks, Margaret luv. You’re an absolute star.”

“And you’re an absolute bollix,” she said, giving him a playful tap. Then she turned to me, snapping back into sternness. “Now, young man. Let’s get you assessed and undressed. It’s getting late, and we’ve rosary in less than an hour.”

From behind her, Eugene piped up, “Ah Margaret, I thought you only had eyes for Anto. Look at him — he’s just devastated.”

I followed her into the harsh humming corridor, leaving the fire’s warmth behind.

The Nurses’ Station was tiny, dominated by filing cabinets and a built-in mahogany desk cluttered with forms. She pointed at a swivel seat. I sat, clutching the ancient pajamas like a life jacket.

For all my bravado, I was fucking terrified. My leg bounced like it was trying to escape my body. If I didn’t get something into me soon, I’d either drop dead from a heart attack or start screaming and never stop. If she rejected me, I had nowhere to go. I was in the back-arse of nowhere — some place in Cavan I’d never been. I pictured myself kidnapped by bogger hillbillies and fed to feral sheep. Nobody would ever hear from me again.

She filled out the intake form silently. The scratch of her Biro felt like a cat clawing a blackboard.

Angus — the Twelve-Stepper who’d stuck his neck out to get me in — had sworn I was guaranteed a bed. He’d done this place three times before it “clicked.” Fourteen months sober now, working, engaged — fair play. But fuck me, three times. I wished I had the cash for some fancy place that worked first time. He’d dropped me off, gave me twenty quid for fags and coffee, and bolted in case I changed my mind.

Finally she looked up. “So you know Angus, then, Liam. You’re lucky you met him. I hope you appreciate the chance you’re being given.”

Relief washed through me. She was keeping me.

She tapped a clipboard thick with names. “That’s the waiting list. Some people have been ringing for weeks. You got in ahead of them. It wasn’t me who let you in.” She touched the small gold cross at her neck. “Do you pray, Liam?”

“Eh… not really, Sister. To be honest, I’m praying right now you’ll give me a few tablets before I keel over.”

She did not find that amusing. “Liam, don’t be a baby. A healthy young man like you could live another thirty or forty miserable years like this. Trust me — I’ve been here nearly forty years.”

Then, unexpectedly, she took my shaking hand. “You’re going to be okay now, love. You’re safe. I don’t need to ask you anything tonight; I can see you’re not able.”

She poured water into a plastic cup and produced an Upjohn 90 — a purple Xanax, the good stuff. She pointed through an observation window to a room that looked like an eighties hospital ward.

“Your bed is in there — first one in front of my window. We’ll keep a good eye on you tonight. Rosary at eight in the sitting room. Tea after in the dining room. Night meds at nine. I’m putting you on a double detox — double medication. Now go get changed. Leave your money here. Keep your fags. And very importantly: no phones, no drugs, no drink, no violence.”

“Yes Sister, thanks Sister — three bags full, Sister.”

“And Liam?”

“Yes, Sister?”

“I’m not a nun. I’m Margaret. Or Mags, if you want. If you really want to butter me up, call me Nurse. Makes me feel important.”

I had no idea if she was serious, so I tried to smile in a way that covered both possibilities.

“In you go,” she said. “Get changed and come back with your bag.”

I floated into the dorm. The pill hadn’t kicked in yet, but knowing it was dissolving in my gut cut the anxiety in half. Having a bed cut it by another ten percent. Things were looking up.

The dorm looked exactly like what I imagined a Catholic boarding school’s hospital wing must look like: bare bones, two rows of eight metal-frame beds facing each other, wooden lockers etched with Biro graffiti and fossilized chewing gum. A faded Italia ’90 sticker of Roy Keane clung to my locker. A large portrait of Our Lady hung beneath an ominous wooden crucifix. Heavy green duck-down blankets — the kind from the Angeles-on-the-radio era — covered each bed.

I sat cautiously. The springs groaned like they’d been rusting since the Famine. Rubber mattress, as expected.

I saw Margaret through the observation window. She glanced up. I waved. She closed the curtain.

I opened my bag. My entire life, condensed:

One soiled going-out shirt  
Three non-fresh underpants  
Two pairs of ripped, blood-stained jeans  
One shrunken hoodie  
One pair of odd socks

Everything stank of stale beer — the bag had doubled as a drink carrier. A busted can of Dutch Gold had left everything sticky.

*Fuck my life. Never pack for yourself on a bender.*

At least I’d remembered my dole card, charge sheets, and court date. And Angus had given me a heavy winter high-vis jacket he had spare from the sites. Fair play — he’d even put it in a bin liner so it wouldn’t get soaked in Dutch Gold. Must be a genius.

“Right, time to change into these yokes,” I muttered.

I followed the stench of bleach and dripping water to the open bathroom door. Six battered toilets, a big metal piss trough with a puddle underneath. Cold as the Arctic. Showering here would be torture. And I’d forgotten basics: no toothbrush, no wash stuff.

*Double fuck my life.*

I stripped out of my battle-scarred clothes — tiny denim jacket, beer-stained Penney’s top over a stinking T-shirt, jeans hanging off me. No jocks. Angus had to give me work boots; my five-quid canvas shoes had been soaked through for days.

I threw on the pajamas — those 80s ones with weird geometric patterns, light navy and white. Too small after losing two stone. I looked like a homeless stick insect from someone’s bad acid trip.

Fuck it.

Back in the dorm, I put on the high-vis. Fashion icon. And guess what — fifteen quid in change in the pockets. Enough for a cuppa from the machine.

Legend. I owed him.

Underpants would still have been handy, though.

I dropped my pathetic belongings back into Margaret’s office. She didn’t react to the stink.

“You better not be lying about the phone.”

I wished I had been. A hazy flash slammed into me — me screaming “FUCKING CUNT!” down the line at my Ma before throwing the phone into the canal. Blink it away.

“On my nanny’s grave, Margaret — it’s gone.”

She hesitated, then nodded. “Smoking area is straight down the hall and left. Rosary in fifteen. Don’t be late.”

“Yes S— … Nurse.”

I headed off, praying I could hide in the smoking area long enough to dodge the Rosary. No offense to Margaret — it just wasn’t my scene.",1,1766233354.0,writers,1,1.0,False

We text for 8 days, met up for a coffee and walked around and ended up making out in the car. Then we meet again 3 days later and do the same thing. Now I normally have dates that don’t include kissing/intimacy so quickly but for some reason this feels different and I feel reckless but also having a really great time which I haven’t done in a while! 

I’m torn between, he does things that are what a guy who is trying to get in your pants does/says or this guy actually likes me and we are clicking like I’ve never had before and is saying everything I’ve wanted to hear without him knowing this.

My instincts are completely terrified and not working in this situation. I can’t tell what is real or not, a lot of this feels like I’m intoxicated while I’m with him (we did smoke weed both times but lightly and it’s not something neither one of us can’t handle) 

 I just want to know what I’m experiencing, because I’m so into this guy but I don’t know anything about him but the things I do know what would normally give me the ick (he doesn’t drive, he didn’t pay for coffee / snacks on both dates though I offered but he didn’t override me, he smokes weed daily, I smoke it here and there but he has a full time job and helps his parents out a lot with bills) but he’s so kind and something about him is so gorgeous and he likes me in a way that I have secretly wanted a guy go like me!! He says all the things that really tickle my fancy and I haven’t liked a guy like this in years! 

I’m worried I’m getting this all wrong and he’s looking for a good time and not a long time OR I’m unable to focus and see this clearly and I’m just going to land myself into trouble (as in sleep with him and he ghosts)

For context: I’m not having sex before marriage, he knows this and we spoke about it twice but our chemistry is so intense and sometimes he kisses me aggressively and I can’t pull away but I don’t necessarily want to pull away and so I’m constantly worried of relaxing because I’m worried I don’t have self control with this guy and I ALWAYS have self control with me but this one is just doing something where I feel 19 again and I think he’s so cute and I haven’t fancied a guy like this in ages and he has some parts of his character which are my cup of tea! He said he respects the no sex thing and has agreed we won’t (which I believe when he said it) 

But I’m concerned for the future and long term what our life will be like financially and with him smoking daily (he has ambitions to buy a house after helping his parents) but when I suggested going for dinner on a second date he said: I don’t mind doing anything with your lovely self, it’s just this month have gave so much for bills, helping family out and then on top of that mortgage, next month gonna be even worse, cause I gotta get the new boiler sorted :/ 😂 so more of an Aladdin to your princes Jasmine at the moment

So I didn’t say anything further because I truly understand humble situations like this but I don’t wanna catch feelings and be that woman that pays more than she should - I don’t mind paying for a guy I like but it seems to have started on a weird precedent ",1,1766232863.0,sexadvise,0,1.0,False

The only row of outlets was taken by a group of people. They were chatting, playing videos out loud, with bags and jackets spread across the entire row, yet only one device was actually plugged in. I stood nearby for a moment. No one looked up. No one said “sorry.”

The old version of me would have quietly walked away, or carried the irritation with me for the rest of the day. But today, I didn’t want to swallow that discomfort. I walked over and said softly, “Sorry, my laptop is about to die. Could I use one of the outlets?” I didn’t accuse them or point out how long they had been there. I simply stated my need.

The air went quiet for two seconds. Then they seemed to realize how much space they had taken. They quickly moved their things, made room, and added a late “sorry.” I noticed a flicker of awkwardness on their faces. It wasn’t the defensiveness of being attacked, but the discomfort of being seen.

I sat down and plugged in my laptop. Somehow, I felt more recharged than my computer. I realized that speaking up for myself doesn’t have to be sharp. Sometimes, gentleness itself is a boundary. Not to embarrass others, but to stop stepping back.

This feels like another small piece of growing up. Not loud. Not silent. Just standing calmly and clearly where I belong.",5,1766232807.0,TheBigGirlDiary,1,1.0,False
