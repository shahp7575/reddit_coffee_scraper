1jcm5wm,https://i.redd.it/29zpz8ri62pe1.jpeg,About me!,"Welcome to my (very NSFW) profile!  Not sure exactly what to tell you to call me or even what I'm going to go by on here yet so I guess we'll work on that.  

I am starting this profile as a way to explore my favorite kinks; breeding (pinning you down, filling you up), impregnation (after successful breeding), pregnancy (your belly swelling with my babies), birth (let's face it, kinda hot right?), and lactation (look, if I'm going to swell it all up I'm gonna benefit from putting your milk in my coffee okay?  Okay.).  

I am a 40 year old white guy who is pretty fit but is developing some dad bod, because age is a bitch like that but I'm told the girls like it.  I shave my head, have a big beard, and I'm a bit on the hairy side.  Dark hair, brown eyes, average height.  

I'm really active.  I like going to the gym (though admittedly I don't like public gyms because gym bros just aren't my style), but I prefer to get my exercise outdoors on the trail.  I got tired of running awhile ago, but a good hard hike is always a good distraction.  

Speaking of hikes, I love the outdoors and nature.  Being outside is my favorite thing.  I am an excellent farmer and gardener, and have quite the green thumb.  I suppose I'm just talented making all things grow.  

While I can't divulge what my job is (makes me sound cooler than it really is), I will say I get to do a lot of awesome stuff outdoors and get paid decently to do it.  It helps being handy enough to build things, fox cars, and so most of my own work myself. 

I'm sure you hear all this and think I'm the manliest man to ever man, but I'm also a huge nerd.  That's right. Need a guy who will fix your car and then DM your DND session before fucking triplets into you?  Look no further girl, I've got what you need.  I know my way around D20.  As an added bonus, I have an affinity for all sorts of boards games and nerd culture, horror movies, heavy metal, and books.  So many god damn books.  You're not going to know what the hell to do with me. 

I'm pretty kinky!  While I've already listed my go-tos, I'm pretty fluent in basic / light domination and subbing.  You subbing of course, I'm the boss in the bedroom..  All you have to do is show up and have lots of orgasm and get / be pregnant.  I can be pretty rough, if that is what you want.  I'm also open to trying new things usually, but bathroom functions and generally gross stuff like that is off the table.  

Ladies, like what you're reading?  I hope to hear from you.  I would love to have some conversations about our shared kink, or even maybe more. ;) ",1,1742133899.0,u_Swollen-Belly-Dreams,0,1.0,False

Hey there! I am 45M who’s on the lookout for an amazing person to share some laughs, good times, and see where things go. I’m into cooking and gardening (pics off food and plants available on request) and love deep conversations. I’m looking for someone who’s ready to have fun and build a genuine connection.

If you’re into traveling, outdoor adventures,  enjoying life and can appreciate a good sense of humor, we’ll definitely get along. I’m all about sharing great moments, whether it’s enjoying a casual day out or deep conversations over coffee.

If you’re looking for something fun, real, and full of potential, send me a message! Let’s see if we can make each other smile and create something meaningful.",1,1742133778.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1jcm2ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/GestationalDiabetes/comments/1jcm2ok/a_week_of_eating/,A week of eating,"When I was first diagnosed I thought I would have to eat super low carb boring food all the time but I've found that actually I'm able to eat reasonable portions of decent-tasting meals as long as I'm making the right choices. So I wanted to share a week of eating in the hope it gives other newly-diagnosed people some ideas!

Context:

* UK
* Diagnosed at 29 weeks
* This represents 34-35 weeks
* I'm on 1g slow-release Metformin twice a day
* All of my 1h post-meal readings have been within range

* Wherever possible, I eat the veggies in the meal first, followed by the protein, ending with the carbs
* Haven't included teas/coffees or no-added-sugar squash

This is in no way intended to shame anyone with high post-meal readings or imply that you're doing anything wrong if you would struggle to tolerate similar meals, just to illustrate that it can be possible to still enjoy some of your favourite foods after diagnosis!

1jcm17j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jcm17j/aio_i_revealed_yesterday_to_this_girl/,AIO I revealed yesterday to this girl,"I’m met this girl while I was filling in at another clinic. I guess she’s a new hire during that shift. I noticed we were really Vibing. I also noticed that she was drawn to me in some ways like over sharing life stuff and acknowledging me from another part of the room or clinic.  
so immediately it clicked because I was noticing like micro expressions, and she was expressing her particular Latino heritage to me, which is what a lot of white people do to me here in the Midwest, (mind you I’m from Los Angeles so I’m born and raised in a Hispanic community so coming here is like a culture shock to me)
But me living my normal boring life doing what I do and then someone comes along who feels different so I wanted to really say goodbye to her cause I was like excited to maybe get to know her in the future and the way we said goodbye was so like whatever bye just I don’t care type vibes
So I was looking for a reason to contact her before the night ended maybe to see or feel out the situation. I left pop tarts in the break room on the counter, and I knew she was gonna be working the next day and I told myself if I let this moment slip up I’m probably never gonna get to know her
So I got her number from another coworker and I texted her. Hey, I left my pop tarts on the break room counter can you throw them out tomorrow morning? She messaged back laughing out loud most likely the janitor people will get it but if they don’t, I will.
That night, we had a very small conversation about our work and I was explaining to her how I was planning on leaving to the military and our conversations fell off from there maybe like a week later she shows up at my clinic to train for like DOT stuff clinical stuff And I was like taken aback by this which was pretty awesome, but I didn’t expect her to be there she never responded back to a message that I had sent her that first night we met
I guess she was taken back by it as well cause she was like hey oh hi all smiles and then she said I’ll text you and I locked her eyes with her when she said that, but she never messaged back 
So I think it was like two days ago I was looking for coverage for this upcoming Saturday cause my friend invited me to comic con so I was messaging everybody that I can ever imagine to cover my Saturday and I said screw it. I’m probably never gonna know this girl ever whatever and she’s probably never gonna care about me in that way so whatever and I’ll just message her if she can help Cover that Saturday shift
Well, when I messaged her, she responded immediately telling me like she’s gonna be working crazy hours within those days if I want we can switch dates around and then she was like oh I wanna go to comic con and just like all this stuff about wanting to be included And I was like yeah let’s go Sunday and she said like yeah, but I would need my Monday or Tuesday covered because I need a day off so long story short we ended up just not going together and I just ended up sticking to the Saturday event
Then I expressed to her that I booked a flight randomly to Florida and I’m just planning on disappearing for some days and she was like take me with you and I was like OK but you’re gonna survive off of tequila and seafood jokingly so you know she was telling me about her difficult issues with her new DOT cert I expressed to her that I am very much informed on the things DOT related and if she ever needs help, I’m that person. 
So I think it was yesterday when she messaged me cause she needed information about how to print up her paystub‘s at home and she was expressing how stressed out she was going to be about her car payment/insurance 
And I just immediately became bold and said well I think you’re cute and some other stuff that I said she didn’t respond for a whole hour and she eventually liked my messages and responded back with a simple. I think you’re cute too. I’ve never been serious with a female, but I’ve done stuff with them and then I don’t know from there. I imagine like giving her her space because of that, but then I said
Or instead of giving you your space, I figured we can probably get some food or coffee and she never responded back so knowing her history of being a bad Texter I was like overthinking it the way I always do. 
this morning I’m just being a little too much at this point I feel because I messaged her a photo of me and my dog and I was like say yes to being interested in getting to know us and I think I’m quirky or witty 
(Redditors don’t come for me. I’m speech texting on the phone. On my way to get coffee. I multitask not single task so if my grammar is horrible, I’m sorry. Murder me find me dox me and all the goods.)
So yeah, I messaged her this morning and still no response but at this point, knowing my jaded self and I’m working my way out of certain bad habits that I do have so I’m trying to be outgoing forward but her no response is really putting me in a space that like maybe she’s not interested i’m really just planning on going back into my jaded cocoon. After this experience. Something tells me it’s not me though because I think that I did the things that I did correctly or something to where she can outrightly say that’s just not something I’m interested in.",1,1742133543.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

We are looking for a coffee machine that works with whole beans. My wife prefers a good-looking machine.

Our first option was the Philips Baristina, but I found out it’s not that great. Next, we considered the SMEG BCC02 in taupe, but I also read that SMEG machines aren’t the best.
Café™ AFFETTO Automatic Espresso Machine also looks nice. But I do not know anything about that brand.

We don’t drink a lot of coffee (just one or two cups per day each) and don’t want a machine that requires a lot of cleaning. We mostly drink cappuccinos or black coffee.

Do you have any recommendations for a good machine that also looks stylish? A taupe-colored option would be a plus!

In the last year, I have gotten closer to the faith by going to mass more (I come from a Catholic background but we never went to church). 

For the first time in my life, I am doing lent. As an act of penance, I have decided to give up coffee and alcohol for the whole duration. Coffee is definitely the most difficult one for me, as I used to drink 2-3 daily, whereas I rarely had more than 2-3 alcoholic drinks per week. This, of course, on top of more time reading my Bible and praying. 

My question simply was, I heard that Sundays were excluded from Lent? Would it be allowable for me to have a coffee on this day? ",0,1742132607.0,Catholicism,2,0.5,False

My name's Brian from the Netherlands. Currently, I'm working towards a bachelor degree majoring in communication and work a little on the side at a webshop, but that that's boring, so enough about that. I like gaming on my Switch, PC and PlayStation and I do a teeny tiny bit of photography and sketching when I get inspired. The sketching I do both on paper with pencils and digitally using a pen display. I usually also watch sci-fi/fantasy series and movies, and on occasion animated shows (like anime or western animation). I'm very introverted and be a bit shy until I get comfortable talking to you.

I'm looking for someone about my age that is also looking for a serious long term relationship. While I have little to no prior experience with relationships, I do value strong connections and want to build a special and even stronger one. The superficial stuff like what color your hair is or what clothes you wear or whatever aren't deal-breakers for me. Only your personality is all I'm in for! And the rest, we'll figure out as we go! While I'm not against an LDR, I prefer someone who lives nearby (nearby = Netherlands/Belgium/UK/Germany), but it's not an issue if you live farther away. It's not a problem for me if the distance between us is big. Because if the spark is there, then no distance will be too great. Of course, I'm open to just being friends too, but that's if we end up not being compatible as more.

I hope to get to know each other. I'm down to meet up for some coffee, but first let's get to know each other with a nice chat. Talk to you soon!",1,1742132570.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Maybe I’ve been waiting for you to read it.

I know it’s a bit odd, writing a collection to someone I haven’t met. But if you’re still reading, maybe you’re a little weird too, and I like that.

I am Thrill. 28 now. Passionate about my work, my hobbies, and (if fate allows) about you. We’re strangers now, but one day, I might know:

>What makes you laugh until you cry

>What song plays when you’re lost in thought

>If you snore when you sleep or talk in your dreams

Maybe we’ll build a home together.A mountainside retreat, a golden retriever, a sunflower field. Or maybe we’ll just be two people sharing coffee on a tired Monday morning. Either way, I want to know you.

But love isn’t just dreamy letters and poetic words. It’s frustration, compromise, inside jokes, and weathering storms together. It’s choosing each other, even when life gets in the way.

So, if you’re out there wherever, whoever; I hope we find each other.

Until then, I’ll be here, leaving one last letter.

Shall we fall in love?

1jclg39,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommates/comments/1jclg39/moved_in_with_friend_and_now_im_starting_to/,"Moved in with friend and now I'm starting to dislike her, any advice?","I (23f) live in a four bedroom apartment with my sister (18f) and two of my close friends (both 23f). My sister, one of our friends (she’s on vacation so she wasn’t she when the new roommate moved in and will be back in a few weeks) and I have been living together for over a year and it’s been smooth sailing, besides some moldy food in the fridge once in awhile, which happens to the best of us.

Our other friend (gonna call her Lucy) moved in with us in Christmas after her old lease ended. I’ve been friends with her for three years now and I enjoyed spending time with her. In the beginning it was nice because even before she moved in she would spend a lot of time at our apartment, she was basically living here already. 

But then the issues started. First it was always leaving the microwave and cabinet doors open (she’d probably leave the fridge open too if it didn’t auto close). She used to leave our microwave open when she visited too and since then we’d always remind her. It’s been three or so months and me and my other roommates continue to remind her to close the doors, we’ve talked to her about it. We got a whiteboard for the fridge and wrote reminders for her. I know it’s a silly thing, it’s just doors but it bothers all of us. It’s even worse when she leaves drawers open because they’re at shin level.

Along with that when she cooks, she leaves a mess on the kitchen counter and strove. We don’t have a lot of space so we use drying mats and she never moves them out of the way so they have stains now. Recently we got a new one because of this and literally a day later it was stained. She spills on the floor and doesn’t wipe it. She lets the trash overflow (mind you she cooks the most and usually 80-90% of the trash is hers) and it’s usually me or my sister throwing it out. I feel like it’s common courtesy to throw the trash out when you see it’s full/ you add the last thing that makes it full.

She leaves her dirty dishes in the sink and on the coffee table. My other roommates and I don’t spend time in the living room so it’s mainly her on the couch always and theres always crumbs and wrappers after she snacks.

We have four main cabinets/shelves we use for storing our food. Once shelf for each person. But my shelf has the spices so we just put them there but she puts other things of hers in it and when I asked her if she could put it in her section she said she didn’t have space. Like?? When do I put my food then?? I literally have nothing in the cabinets besides sugar and spices because I don’t have space. Before she moved in we had also split the fridge and kept it neat and organised but she buys so much food compared to us and fills it and it always looks messy and its hard to find space for my stuff. Like she’d put raw chicken next to my grapes, which is such a small thing but also a health hazard.

She never washes her dishes properly, like I wouldn’t care if they were her dishes but it also includes other dishes (since we all share some). Like there’s visible food scraps or oil and such on the corners of the dishes. The bowls are oily cause they aren’t washed properly. Worse when it’s specifically one of our personal ones.

Yes I’ve explained this to her, told her about how we divide the cabinets and everything. She just doesn’t listen.

I know these are all small things but it’s frustrating when it builds up and I’m staring to dislike her. What makes it worse is that it’s usually me and my sister cleaning the common areas that we don’t even use often. Especially my sister, like almost every time I see her she is cleaning. This was never issue with our past roommates or our other friend who lives with us.

I feel like we’ve brought up these issues and said these things to her so many times now that it just goes into one ear and comes out the other.

TLDR: my friend moved in with us (all four roommates are friends) and she is very messy and lazy about cleaning common areas after use, washing dishes properly, uses a lot of the communal storage space despite us already discussing how we share it (Multiples times). We always find ourselves cleaning and picking up after her.

I’m a basically attractive older woman and have always been popular, with a few close friends and a larger social circle. I’m often asked to represent my company and speak publicly (which I hate). I don’t enjoy birthday parties that celebrate me—though I love cake and presents with my family. I dreaded my wedding’s first dance and walking down the aisle, but my spouse made it bearable.

I enjoy my own company and am never bored. But when I’m out in public alone, I’d rather not be seen. I’ll stay in my hotel room (I travel a lot for work) or at home and go without something just to avoid going out. It’s not that I’m embarrassed to be alone—I just want to be invisible.

When I travel alone, I put up the Do Not Disturb sign and prefer housekeeping not to come, even if I’m out.

Right now, we’re visiting my husband’s hometown. He’s with the kids, and it took me two hours to convince myself to go out for coffee. If they were with me, I wouldn’t have thought twice about it. The coffee shop was crowded, so I took my drink to go and found a quiet nook outside in the cold rather than staying inside. That’s when it hit me: I prefer to be invisible.

Shopping alone feels the same way—I just don’t want to be noticed.

Why do I do this? Is it because when I’m with others, I feel like I HAVE to mask. But when I’m alone, I don’t—so maybe I just want to sneak by unnoticed? Does anyone else feel this way? Is this an ADHD thing?",7,1742131662.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

Hey there,  
I’m a 29-year-old guy trying to make sense of life, one existential dread at a time. I’m an introvert with a resting “why so serious?” face, but around the right people, I can be the loudest one in the room (or at least the one with the most awkward jokes).  

Here’s the deal: I’m not entirely sure what I’m looking for, but I know I could use a friend right now. Someone to talk to about the big things (life, art, mental health, why Arsenal refuses to win the EPL) and the little things (what you cooked today, that song you can’t stop looping, or how you survived Monday without caffeine). If we vibe, I’m open to seeing where it goes—whether that’s a deeper connection, a relationship, or just someone to share memes and comfortable silences with.  

A bit about me:  

- Music: Kendrick, JID, and the new Carti album on loop. If you’re into music that hits the soul, we’ll get along.  
- Health: 2023 taught me that health is everything. I’m into gymming, eating clean, and sleeping like it’s my job. But I also enjoy getting high occasionally (once or twice a month) to just *exist* without overthinking.  
- Hobbies: Cooking is my therapy, coffee is my fuel (the darker, the better), and I have a soft spot for psychedelic art and deep conversations.  
- Humor: Dark, witty, and sarcastic. If you can handle awkward jokes and existential rants, we’re golden.  
- Travel: Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my mood boosters. Bonus points if you’re into deep, emotional, or spiritual conversations during sunsets.  

### What I’m looking for:  
- A nurturing, affectionate, and witty person who’s okay with my occasional shutdowns (I’m working on it, I promise).  
- Someone who’s passionate about *something*—art, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.  
- A two-way connection where we can talk about our days, dreams, and everything in between.  
- Bonus if you’re a football fan or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.  

I’m not here to rush into anything. Let’s start with a conversation and see where it goes. If you’re someone who’s kind, patient, and maybe a little lost too, hit me up. Let’s figure this life thing out together.  

P.S. If you’ve read this far, you’re already cooler than 90% of people I know. Slide into my DMs with your favorite song, a random fact, or just a “hi” if you’re feeling brave. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something real. Your move. 😊

1jclcsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1jclcsu/25m4f_italyeurope_in_search_of_a_heart_to_call/,25[M4F] Italy/Europe - in search of a heart to call home,"In a world filled with lies and facades, I crave something authentic and real, I crave a connection where my lover can come in my arms and be my baby after a day that stretches full of responsibilities, without any pretense.

Being vulnerable carries an inherent risk but with right person makes it all worth it

I think most of us are afraid in some sense to love and to be completely vulnerable yet despite the risk we long for it.

I find myself deeply longing for a sincere and profound connection. Hopefully, you are looking for the same?

The capacity to love, sometimes even in the face of pain, is one of the most beautiful aspects of being human. It's a strength, and not always a weakness.

At my core, I'm a person of love, of care, of deep unyielding affection for those I hold dear.

Through the journey of healing and self-discovery, I've realized that I have much love to share. Love that is not bitter, but kind; not resentful, but forgiving; not closed, but open and willing to grow alongside someone special.

I'm invested in my attempt to forge a connection and hope you are too, I'd try to share things about me that might give you idea of the person I am.

**Essence of Me:**

I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I’m someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Brown
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**

What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that’s both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one’s soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you – not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.

 After multiple episodes of panic attack and GAD I was advised to stay off coffee for a while.

As advised I was off coffee for about 3 months.
When I consumed coffee recently after 3 months I started feeling jittery which lasted for about 3-4 hrs. So I read in some article which said coffee is a diuretic and if you drink water before drinking coffee its likely cause less effect and I followed the same and no more JITTERS now.

So every time I drink coffee now I drink 2 glasses of water.

Not sure if I'm solving a problem, or creating one with my current approach","I adopted a second cat, Shiloh (2F) back in November of last year, introducing her to my resident cat, Glinda (12F) over the last 4 months or so. 

We had some hiccups, but both cats are integrated now - full time able to move between one another's space and co-existing, and sometimes even both cuddling with me on the couch at the same time.  

I give both cats ample solo cuddle time, usually at least 1 hour each per day, along with intermittent play periods throughout the day (pretty much any time I get up, I try to play with Shiloh for anywhere from 5-15 minutes). Glinda sometimes participates, but isn't always interested. 

However, I noticed about a month ago that Shiloh was stalking my resident cat, Glinda and swiping after her as she came out of the litter box. I did two things to remedy this: Got a 3rd litter box and moved Glinda's litter box up on a table that Shiloh could not reach (she is not much of a jumper and has very short legs lol). I didn't want Glinda to develop an aversion to using the litter box because of Shiloh's prowling behavior.

Thing is, Glinda's food is also up on a high surface, because Shiloh was trying to eat it. What this means is that Glinda's basically living her life on the ""second floor"" of my apartment, traipsing from cat trees, to the coffee table, to the couch, to the side tables, to the dining room table, to the table with her litter box. Shiloh primarily stays on the ground, though she'll jump up on the couch with me if Glinda's in her cat tree and will always cuddle with me on the reading chair in my bedroom. She also hops up onto a cabinet where I keep my cat supplies (it's about 2ft high). 

Shiloh still chases after Glinda at least once per day when I'm home, and sometimes a few times per day unless I intervene. Shiloh doesn't chase Glinda beyond the initial attempt to swipe at her, but usually this is because Glinda has jumped up on a high surface.

TLDR: I'm wondering whether my efforts to give Glinda an escape route from Shiloh's swiping have increased Shiloh's sense of insecurity and thus led to more chasing because Glinda always has the (literal) high ground over her. Alternatively, is this kind of chasing behavior normal?

For some reason, I have always struggled socially being around a large group of women and function better in very small circles or one on one coffee meeting. There is always (and I am not exaggerating I am sick of people saying that ) the couple of mean girls who contaminate the entire large group whether it's work or class because they have an issue with me literally being quite and not super joyful when I say hello. That's the first silly reason.  Mind you all these examples have been me being quiet in class, saying hi, or walking my dog in the street. I grew up being bullied  and hasn't change as an adult.

Also, as a highly sensitive neurodivergent girl I'am fine feeling ok in my own skin with self care or decent self presentation and I get even more more attacks that I am sick of !!!! I only happened to know about this because another person ( that is how disconnected I am ) tells me that they talk about how I look and that I should not try yo be or look feminine because it is childish ( unintelligent, ignorant judgement)  I tend to avoid eye contact and try to wear headphones to avoid witnessing this. Of course there are times I hear them right behind or next to me cuz that's how hateful and bored with their lives must be. 

Why do folks despise so much someone who is just different ??? or acts different?

It all boils down to female misogyny and I get it a lot from couples and men that enjoy talking trash about girls to entertain their girlfriend. when I am walking and they start talking about me being distracted or walking slow or just glaring at me ",4,1742130517.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False

It was a great deal of banter back and forth, and she would send me videos and pictures of herself and the scenery as she was on holiday in Asia and I was doing the same as I went on holiday too. Every two days we would text each other and rather flirtatious.

On her dating profile she indicated she was looking for ""fun casual dates / long term relationship"".

When we both returned from holiday we set up a date. It was just before Ramadan which began on a Sunday, So, in light of this, I asked her if she wanted to meet on a Thursday and Friday. We met on both days, which culminated in dinner, coffee and even going to the spa by booking a private spa room (which she was open to as well). While we were there, we vibed and got sexual but no penetration. Afterwards we had dinner and then went to the arcades. Generally we vibed well and had a similar outlook on some topics and she told me how different I was in real life as compared to online from a positive standpoint. We do differ though in the sense that she was in a long term relationship with another man for 7 years but had an ""open relationship"" where she slept with 5 other men during that time. Nonetheless, I was respectful of this and I did not judge her at all. In terms of her character, she describes herself as ""introverted extrovert"" and is able to spend time alone quite comfortably and does not enjoy a strong relationship to her parents and was rebellious in her teen years as she did not fit the profile of how her parents were hoping she would turn out to be (although I must say she is educated and smart).

On our first date, I told her that soon Ramadan would begin and I would be very busy for the next 4 weeks with fasting and that I usually do not go out in the evenings as I am breaking my fast and spending time with family. I mentioned that to her so she does not misunderstand my intentions and think I am not interested if we do not see each other in this period. She was very understanding of this and appreciated me telling her this in advance. I told her we can still keep the contact and even break a fast together at some stage and she was open to that. So, after our second date, I dropped her off home and gave each other a kiss and that was it for the night.

One week passes by and then I send her a text asking her how she is doing and share a picture of the dinner table at my familys home to show her how we break the fast, like a part of my culture. I see one tick on Telegram, which means it is delivered but she has deliberately not opened the message. Its been 7 days. Normally she would be much more responsive. I know for a fact she was active on the app because she changed her profile picture after I texted her.

Now, despite the fact that during my initial conversations with her I told her I am the kind who always respected open and honest communication and that being disinterested is okay as long as it is communicated respectfully, I genuinely felt she understood that. This makes me the all the more surprised at her behaviour. In fact, as we got to know each other on our first date, I explicitly told her that I I am not a fan of ghosting or blocking someone but always appreciated transparent communication. She even told me at one point how she is the type who does not like having arguments with people but will communicate in some way when she no longer wants to meet someone.

I will not double text and do anymore chasing but my text to her was just to keep some momentum and the conversation going while I also focus on the month of fasting. I understand that fun casual dates are just that, but would a woman not have a bit more empathy towards a man who made a real genuine effort over two dates (it was really well thought out in terms of the dinner place and the wellness box was expensive) and considering the fact I explicitly told her how I hate ghosting?

You also gain knowledge on gunsmithing, ammo production, basic electrical generators and wires and how to make them, as well as the ability to manifest 64 steel ingots and chunks of coal coke a day.


*Thermal Foundation* - an absolute classic, you gain knowledge on metal alloys and compounds, as well as gears and machines that work to turn those metals into gears, plates, alloys and more.
This mod also comes with extremely powerful generators, capable of turning a single diamond into enough energy to fuel a building for a year. You also gain the ability to manifest up to a stack of ingots of any of the metals added by this mod, and you get to manifest as much redstone from Minecraft as you want.

**Combo Mods (Tech)** : these are bonus optional mods that you unlock and can choose to get by having the required component mods.

*Gregtech* (Actually Additions + Thermal Foundation + Immersive Engineering) -
You gain absolute knowledge over chemistry, and are able to make any existing chemical compound you want at will.

*Applied Energistics 2* (Refined Storage + Thermal Foundation + Galacticraft) - from compounds and imprints found in meteors, you can further improve your storage technology, allowing for entire pocket dimensions to act as means of storage. Also you gain cross-dimensional access to your existing storage system, like a personal inventory of your own.


*Stargates* (Gregtech + Galacticraft + Refined Storage). The culmination of space materials, lasers and dimensional data, this allows for the creation of stargates that are able to transport you and your things anywhere, throughout the entire multiverse. You gain a mental map of the multiverse, with each universe having a specific code to input to travel there.

**Magic Mods**: these grant you access to the arcane arts, able to be used at will.

*Electroblob's Wizardry* - You are able to create crystals from stone or flowers that contain immense mana, which can be fashioned into wands which can cast spells from spellbooks that have been randomly scattered throughout the world among regular books. Ordinary humans will not be able to tell that a spellbook is magical and see it as an ordinary book.


*Ars Nouveau* - You are able to generate Source gems, these gems are fuel for arcane rituals, machines and such. You are also able to create glyphs through these rituals, that can be used in conjunction with a spellbook to create and modify spells, like a programming language.

present active imperative 2nd singular

✓ imperfect active indicative 3rd singular

Logeion is basically a lookup table of forms that have occurred in actual texts, but in addition they have a copy of Morpheus installed now. You used to have to click through to see the Morpheus results separately, but it looks to me like they are now showing unattested Morpheus results at the top, intermixed with the static table results, and I think that's what's happening here with the POS tag that shows it as a possible imperative form.

Maybe I'm just in a daze because I haven't had my third cup of coffee this morning, but is this a bug in Morpheus? An imperative just shouldn't have the augment, and in any case Morpheus is calling this a possible \*present\* imperative.

As a side issue, in case anyone wants to use crayons with me, I'm finding the formation of the imperfect form (which is real and attested) to be confusing. I would expect it to be ἤφιε, which CGL does say occurs in the NT.

1 write items from monthly planner on whiteboard while coffee brewing  
2 address any actionable emails/texts on phone while i drink my coffee

*side note: i have a daily 'finish coffee > drink water > 30 min > brush/floss' alarm that i repeatedly snooze (to remind myself to drink) until i've finished drinking my water*

*if the total amount of time required to complete tasks is less than my available time, stop game-planning and immediately begin working on items in any order because it doesn't matter what order they are completed in because there is enough time to do all items*

*otherwise, if there are any urgent items (which is rare now that my values are clear), immediately begin working on those in any order because they ALL have to get done*

*if there is still available time after all urgent items are done, then begin working on non-urgent items in any order because NONE of them need to be done*

*priorities = food > hygiene > exercise*

*s.a.f.e. = i only have to do things that keep me from being 'sick', 'arrested', 'fired' or 'evicted'*

*a.d.a.m. = 'what would/does the average person do?' (am i holding myself to unfairly high standards?), 'damage' (will not doing this today result in any real damage?), 'accumulate' (if i don't do this will it add to my backlog or might it just 'go away'?) and 'does this MATTER?'*

routine:

breakfast = oatmeal, lunch = burrito bowl, dinner = pasta every day

chicken and bananas drive grocery trips because they are the most perishable items. i keep my grocery list on a whiteboard on the side of my fridge and take a picture of it on the way out of the house to the grocery.

i bake four days worth of chicken at once which takes 10 min of effort and can be done during the workday. same for rice.

10am breakfast and 1pm lunch affords three 2-hour productivity periods (8-10, 11-1 and 2-4) between 'recharging'

11-1 is 'me time' even during the work week as this is lunch hour-ish and therefore i won't be missed or expected to respond immediately. thus, i can run errands, take a long walk, etc. during this time that i can be away from my computer for an extended period.

4-10 evening routine 7 days/wk = dinner > gym > shower > meditate (no EF/decisions to make)

gym schedule = day one upper body > day two lower body/stretch > day three cardio > repeat

upper body = push and pull things. lower body = push things and planks. cardio = long walk outdoors/treadmill or elliptical

strategies:

meditate or work on small things (<= 15 min) instead of TV/guitar/social media

almost anything can be broken down into 15 min chunks

i can work on <= 15 min things during the workday because no one will miss me and because they know i need to occasionally get out of the house for a walk around the block anyway

i put a lacrosse ball on my keyboard to keep MS Teams from registering that i'm away. that way, if nobody needed me while i was away and nobody knew i was away then i can be away again...and again...and again...

SOPs:

i have standard operating procedures for everything around the house so i can just mindfully get 'r done without thinking / reinventing the wheel every time

the 'game plan' and above strategies gives me 'permission' to 'just' do whatever needs to be done without having anxiety that there's somewhere else i need to be or something else i need to be doing.",1,1742129813.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

1jcktq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jcktq8/can_you_really_whiten_your_teeth_at_home_i_tried/,Can You Really Whiten Your Teeth at Home? I Tried Laughland for 6 Days to Find Out,"I’ve always been a little skeptical about at-home teeth whitening. I’ve tried strips, whitening toothpaste, and even DIY baking soda tricks, but none of them gave me the kind of results I wanted. Either they worked a little but made my teeth feel sensitive, or they didn’t work at all.

After doing some research, I kept seeing **Laughland teeth whitening** mentioned. What made it different from other products was that it uses **a dentist-formulated gel and an LED light** to help activate the whitening process. It sounded more advanced than the whitening strips I was used to, so I decided to give it a shot.

Here’s how it went after six days of using it consistently.

# What’s Inside the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

The kit arrived quickly, and right away, I liked that it was **simple and easy to use**. Inside the box, there were:

* **Whitening Gel Pens** – No messy trays, just a simple application.
* **LED Mouthpiece** – Helps activate the gel for deeper whitening.
* **Clear Instructions** – Straightforward and easy to follow.

I liked that the process wasn’t complicated—just apply the gel, use the LED light, and wait.

# How It Works

One thing I appreciated was how **quick and convenient** the process was. Each session takes just **10 minutes a day**. Here’s what I did:

1. **Brushed and dried my teeth** to make sure the gel would stick properly.
2. **Applied the gel** evenly using the pen applicator.
3. **Inserted the LED mouthpiece** and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinsed and cleaned** my mouth and the mouthpiece for the next session.

The gel didn’t have a weird aftertaste, which was a big plus for me.

# My Results After 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No huge difference, but my teeth felt extra clean.
* **Day 3:** Noticed some of the dullness fading, and stains were less noticeable.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were **6-7 shades whiter**, and the color looked even and natural.

The biggest surprise? **No pain or sensitivity.** I was expecting at least some discomfort, but I felt nothing, even when drinking cold water.

# Why Laughland Worked Better Than Other Whitening Methods

* **Better coverage than strips** – Since you apply the gel yourself, you can target all areas of your teeth.
* **Faster results than whitening toothpaste** – I noticed a change within a few days instead of weeks.
* **No sensitivity issues** – Unlike other products that left my teeth feeling weak, this one didn’t cause any discomfort.

# How It Compares to Other Whitening Products

* **Whitening Strips** – Worked somewhat, but left my teeth feeling sensitive.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** – Helped maintain whiteness but didn’t remove deep stains.
* **Professional Whitening** – Very effective but too expensive for regular use.

Laughland felt like **the best balance**—it delivered noticeable results, wasn’t expensive, and didn’t leave my teeth feeling sore.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

1. **Does it damage enamel?** – No, the formula is made to be effective yet gentle on teeth.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** – Yes, it noticeably improved coffee stains for me.
3. **How long do results last?** – With good oral hygiene, the results can last for months.

# Tips for the Best Results

* **Use it daily** – Consistency is key to getting noticeable results.
* **Avoid staining foods** – Coffee, tea, and red wine can slow down the whitening process.
* **Brush and floss regularly** – Helps maintain results for longer.

**Thinking about trying it? More details are available** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# Final Thoughts – Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening worked better than strips and whitening toothpaste**. It was simple to use, didn’t cause any pain, and actually brightened my teeth in less than a week.

Would it replace professional whitening? Probably not for extreme cases, but for an **affordable, effective, and painless** way to whiten teeth at home, it’s worth considering.

1jcksmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcksmd/glucose_tolerance_tests/,Glucose Tolerance Tests,"On Wednesday I had my 1 hour glucose tolerance test and my result was 189 with a cutoff of 140. I was freaking out and spiraled online. I thought for sure I had GD based on some people saying at 190 they were diagnosed right away without a 3 hour. I got a call from my OB and they asked me to go get the 3hr GTT asap. I did it yesterday and passed all of them!

Fasting (range 65-94) - 81

1 hour (>180) - 171

2 hour (>155) - 141

3 hour (>140) - 94

I just wanted to share as I had trouble finding stories with anyone that was as high as my 1 hour that didn’t have GD. 

I have since learned that stress can affect your blood sugar and I was driving all day before my 1 hour for my kids band assessment, dropped my phone in a public toilet, and had a particularly hard time finding a quest location that had appts/walk in time available after their assessment which was the only time I’d have to take the test.

And for what it’s worth (though I know you can’t trick your body and should eat how you normally eat before the 1- hour test) prior to my test I had my normal morning coffee, and took my kids for a treat breakfast at McDonald’s. My order was a bacon egg and cheese bagel, hash brown we ate about 6 hours before my test. I also had about 1.5 liters of water between breakfast and my test.

Lastly, my experiences during both tests were fine. I had the lemon lime at the 1 hour (tasted like flat sprite) and fruit punch at the 3 hour (tasted like red Kool-Aid, this is the best of the 3 imo, for Fisher Healthcare brands anyway). 

The 3 hour was boring but I had a book, my phone, and some headphones. I was not allowed to leave the lobby during the test. After I was done my husband and kids drove me home which was 1.5 hours away. I was extremely fatigued. At about the 1 hour mark (so 4 hours after drinking the glucose drink) I started feeling really faint, I got really hot, even though I had the air on as low as it would go. My clothes were drenched in sweat and I had trouble breathing. I felt really nauseated and just altogether *not well*. I must have looked pale/sick too bc my husband kept asking if I was okay. We got back into town and stopped and got some food and finally made it back home. It took me another couple of hours to have energy and not feel like my limbs were heavy and I could move normally at which point I resumed my nesting habits and finished all of our laundry.

Hi everyone,


I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Okay, picture this: You're a high achiever juggling a million things, and someone says, ""Just use time blocking. It'll solve all your problems!"" Sounds like a lifesaver, right? Well, not exactly...

**Confession time**: I tried time blocking religiously. Had every minute accounted for, from my 6 AM workout to prepping my gourmet-ish lunch. Spoiler alert: it was a total disaster. Instead of feeling like a productive powerhouse, I felt like a robot following an overly-ambitious script. Anyone else been there? 🙋‍♀️

Here’s why I think **time blocking can backfire for us overachievers**:

- **Life is unpredictable**: You set a perfect schedule, but then life throws you a curveball. It could be a last-minute meeting or your cat knocking over your coffee. 🐱☕ Flexibility? Not in the time blocker’s handbook.
  
- **Energy, not hours**: We've all got those moments when we can't focus for the life of us, and other times we're in the zone and crushing it. *Why force yourself into a task when your brain says ‘nah’ and miss out on peak creativity?*

- **The guilt trap**: Missing one blocked session can feel like failing a crucial mission. Who needs that extra stress, right?

So, what did I do? I flipped the script and focused on **optimizing my energy instead**. Here’s the twist that saved me about 10 hours a week:

1. **Identify your energy peaks**: Morning person or night owl? Use your high-energy times for deep focus work and save low-energy periods for the routine stuff like emails (don’t we all love those?).

2. **Task batching by energy level**: Group similar energy-needing tasks together. Social butterfly at 3 PM? Call your clients or brainstorm with your team then.

3. **Embrace the *""imperfectly perfect""* schedule**: Leave room for spontaneity. Yeah, it sounds crazy, but sometimes what we see as ""unproductive"" is exactly what our mind needs.

Honestly, it's a game-changer. I feel more aligned and way less overwhelmed. Plus, I gained some extra hours to binge my favorite series guilt-free! 🎬😌

Has anyone else ditched the rigid time block for something more fluid? Or maybe you're in love with your color-coded calendar and want to defend its honor? Let’s chat!

And that’s why Kendu is on track to become the biggest success story in decentralized finance.

First, Kendu has what so many DeFi projects lack: a strong, loyal holder base. This isn’t a flash-in-the-pan meme coin. It’s a project with a dedicated community that has already built Kendu into a $300 million market cap powerhouse. These holders aren’t here for quick flips. They believe in Kendu’s vision, and they are in it for the long haul.

Second, real-world events are a game-changer. When people come together in person—at crypto meetups, industry conventions, and Kendu-hosted gatherings—they build relationships that can’t be replicated online. These events create trust, attract new investors, and strengthen the Kendu brand in a way that no amount of tweets or Telegram messages ever could.

Third, this is a community-led movement, not a VC-backed experiment. Too many DeFi projects rely on big-money investors who manipulate the market and dump at the first sign of trouble. Kendu is different. It’s fueled by real people who believe in its mission. That means organic growth, long-term sustainability, and a financial revolution that isn’t controlled by a handful of insiders.

Fourth, Kendu isn’t just an online phenomenon. It’s making waves in the real world with Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Jewelry, and Kendu Nights in India. That’s right—this isn’t just about charts and market caps. It’s about creating real products and experiences that connect people to the movement in their daily lives. Whether it’s powering the future with Kendu Energy, fueling conversations over a cup of Kendu Coffee, wearing the brand with Kendu Jewelry, or celebrating at Kendu Nights in India, this isn’t just a token. It’s a lifestyle.

Finally, Kendu is rewriting the narrative of what a DeFi project can be. This isn’t just another crypto experiment. It’s a revolution, led by a passionate community that refuses to settle for anything less than success. The combination of real-world engagement, grassroots momentum, and a vision that extends beyond the blockchain is what will make Kendu the biggest success story in DeFi.

The future of decentralized finance belongs to the people. And the people have chosen Kendu.

It’s from 2007—almost 20 years old now—but OMG, it still hits hard. Especially when you think about where luxury brands are at today, it’s wild. Here’s some stuff I found pretty interesting after reading it—wanted to share with you all!



1.Where Luxury Came From—Big Brands Started as Tiny Shops

So, like 60% of today’s luxury market is owned by 35 major brands—think Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, Armani, Hermès, Chanel—all raking in over a billion bucks a year. But here’s the tea: most of these fancy brands we obsess over started with humble 18th- and 19th-century artisans making stuff for royalty.

https://preview.redd.it/9xn3eoram1pe1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bbb3d9523e875ea75490adead41d812f01685f2

Back when the Bourbons and Bonapartes were ruling France, that’s when modern luxury was born. By the late 19th century, kings and queens were out, the bourgeoisie was in, and this elite circle of European aristocrats and American bigwigs—like the Vanderbilts, Astors, and Whitneys—made luxury their exclusive club. It was like a VIP pass to high society, something to flex if you had the right last name. Plus, they only made small batches—usually custom—and sold to a tiny group of super-rich folks.

Fast forward to now: these companies still carry the founders’ names, but most have been scooped up by business moguls. In the last 20 years, they’ve turned single brands into multi-billion-dollar empires everyone on the planet knows.

 

2. The Secret Behind “Made In” Labels

Luxury brands guard their logos and trademarks like crazy, only giving manufacturers a set number of labels per handbag order. One manufacturer spilled to the author that barely any bags actually say “Made in China”—and if they do, it’s sneaky AF. Like, the label’s sewn into the bottom of an inside pocket or printed on a tiny leather patch the size of a stamp (you’d need a magnifying glass to read it). Most of the time, you’ll see “Made in Italy,” “Made in France,” or “Made in U.K.” slapped on there instead.

https://preview.redd.it/oek4gh8em1pe1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=6798f3528c43ceb06307d4323b98fdd324ed21b2

Brands pull all kinds of tricks to dodge the “China” tag. Some stick a “Made in China” sticker on the outer packaging, then rip it off when the shipment hits Italy and swap it for a “Made in Italy” one. Others make the whole bag in China except the handles, add those in Italy, and call it “Italian.” Or they’ll do the labor-heavy part of a shoe upper in China, slap a sole on in Italy, and—bam—“Made in Italy.”

3. IT Bags—A Marketing Genius Move

Back in the late 18th century, European ladies wore these flowy, pocketless dresses and had to shove their valuables into little bags—the OG handbags. By the late 19th century, sewing and embroidery were a thing, and fancy upper-class women kept their needles in gorgeous little bags. Carrying anything else? Total faux pas—that’s why you had servants.

Modern handbags popped off in the 20th century with women’s suffrage. They screamed independence—like, “I can leave the house whenever, no one needs to know.” Soon, they became a must-have for regular people.

The “IT bag” thing? That’s only been around for like 20 years—super young and fresh. It’s basically a marketing flex by luxury companies. In the ‘90s, fashion mags were like, “Can’t update your wardrobe every season? Just grab a new bag, babe, and you’re golden.” Brands pushed bags as the ultimate statement piece, making them the star of these wild, in-your-face ad campaigns. Bags turned into this intoxicating obsession.

Today, handbags are so key to a luxury brand’s success that Gucci blamed Yves Saint Laurent’s meh 2005 sales on not having a hit bag that year. Meanwhile, the IT bag took Fendi from a tacky old fur company to a top-tier fashion house. Wild, right?

 

4. Louis Vuitton’s Rise—and Its Dark Spot

Mr. Louis Vuitton was a pro at packing pretty dresses and flashy stuff into trunks, so he became Empress Eugénie’s go-to packer and trunk-maker under Napoleon. That royal stamp of approval? Pure gold. His business blew up. In 1859, he bought land in a Paris suburb to build a little two-room factory—now it’s a touristy LV museum.

From the late 19th century to pre-WWII, that was the elegant era—maybe luxury’s last real golden age. Louis’s son Georges, at 31, designed the iconic LV checkerboard pattern—chocolate brown and beige, with some squares saying “Marque Louis Vuitton Deposee” in white, showing it’s a legit trademark. That’s when “designer brands” were born.

But here’s the messy part: during WWII, to keep the lights on, some French luxury and couture shops—including LV—sold to Nazi officers and the wives of French traitors. It’s a family secret LV never wants to talk about, and it didn’t come out until 2004.

 

5. Luxury Boutiques—The “Vertical Integration” Glow-Up

Those fancy flagship stores you see on main streets? They weren’t always a thing. It’s a big reform tied to Louis Vuitton.

 In 1977, Louis Vuitton’s son-in-law, 65-year-old Henry Racamier, took over. He wasn’t a fashion guy—he was a businessman. After reading a ton, he realized retailers—especially franchise dealers—were pocketing the biggest chunk of profits. Back then, most luxury companies were still small, family-run, and kinda clueless about business.

 Racamier said, “Nah,” and kicked out the middlemen. He launched LV-owned boutiques with a “vertical integration” strategy. It was a game-changer—financially, it crushed it. In just a few years, LV’s profits shot up to a wild 40%, while most competitors were stuck at 15-25%. Now, pretty much every luxury brand follows his playbook, controlling everything from top to bottom.

 

6. Luxury’s Big Shift—From Status to Cash

Over the last 30 years, disposable income in rich countries has skyrocketed. People are marrying later, leaving more cash to splurge on themselves. Plus, they’re more educated and traveled than their parents, so they’ve got a taste for the finer things.

Big-shot CEOs and financiers sniffed the opportunity. They swooped in, snatched brands from aging founders or their less-savvy heirs, and turned family businesses into corporate machines. They standardized everything—stores, staff uniforms, products, even the coffee cups at meetings. Then they targeted the “middle market”—a huge mix of people: teachers, salespeople, tech entrepreneurs, mansion-dwellers, tacky nouveaux riches, even sketchy millionaires.

Luxury execs call it “democratizing luxury” to make it “accessible to all.” Sounds noble, right? Nah, it’s just a slick way to rake in more cash.

 

7. Charles Worth—The First Fashion Godfather

Charles Worth is basically the dad of modern haute couture. In the mid-19th century, women wore these huge, poofy dresses with layers of petticoats underneath. Then Worth invented the crinoline—game-changer.

https://preview.redd.it/5k0lq25tm1pe1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=bff1ef811b88ab76d29a93521de697e09cff712a

He’s the “father” because he didn’t just make what people ordered. Every season, he designed a collection for customers to pick from. He was one of the first to throw fashion shows and slap his signature label on clothes. He decided what was hot, and everyone followed. Historian Hippolyte Taine said, “Women would drop anything to be dressed by him.” Iconic.

I went out to dig up one of his designs—check it out and let me know what you think of the vibe! which fashion godfather’s got that kinda clout these days?

8. Oscars—The Ultimate Luxury Ad Spot

The Oscars are the glitziest celeb fest and the biggest promo opp for luxury brands. Harry Winston’s jewelry rep, Carol Brodie, told the author that if a celeb rocks your stuff on the red carpet, “sales spike every month” for years. “We only spend like a million bucks on ads in the U.S. a year,” he said, “but ask any American who Harry Winston is, and they’re like, ‘Oh, the jeweler who dresses up stars!’” Outfitting celebs is the best way to get eyes on you.

Uma Thurman put Prada on the map, Charlize Theron boosted Vera Wang, Halle Berry made Elie Saab a name. Sometimes, celeb agencies even sign deals with brands—rules like: brooch above the waist, hair up to show earrings, say the brand name 2-4 times on national TV, and if anyone asks, name-drop loud and clear.

These days, the Oscars totally don’t have that kinda crazy exposure anymore.

 

9. Asia’s Biggest consumer

When it comes to luxury’s top market, you’d think China, right? Nope—this book’s from 2007, before China’s shoppers took over. Back then, it was all about Japan.

The stats are nuts:

A: Japanese shoppers, at home and abroad, made up half of global luxury spending.

B: 85% of Japanese people called themselves middle-class—post-war class lines blurred, and they could all afford luxury.

C: 40% of Japanese owned LV stuff.

Everyone knows Japan loves LV. In the ‘70s, their economy boomed, disposable income shot up, and their obsession with quality drove them to these fancy, well-made goods. But Japan’s luxury sales were weird back then—no brand boutiques. Instead, Japanese traders would hit up Paris stores, buy in bulk at retail price (!!), ship it back, and sell it for 3-4 times more. So blunt, not very “mysterious Japan” vibes. (Though some brands still use local distributors today—it’s a global oddity.)

LV’s Paris store kept selling out to swarms of Japanese buyers. Finally, they opened shops in Japan, charging 1.5 times the Paris price. To cater to them, duty-free retail (like DFS) popped off. Hawaii became a hotspot—close to Japan, American flair, even took yen. LV and others set up stores there, hired Japanese-speaking staff, teamed up with tour groups, and extended hours—all for Japanese shoppers.

So, over the years, China’s taken the crown as Asia’s biggest luxury market, but lately, its luxury scene’s been kinda tanking. Which country’s got the best shot at snagging the top spot next?

Last a funny bit from the book: A Japanese bought an evening gown, found a tiny thread loose, and swapped it at the store. The owner tested it—gave it to a French woman, who saw the thread but was like, “I’ll just cut it off, it’s fine.” Then an American tried it on and bought it without even noticing. What are we doing wrong, lol?

Not only that, the Manager tried to lie straight to my face. 

Lets start with the good. Theres alot of good.

Meatball Bolognese - Suprisingly, I would say this is like a higher leveled Filipino Spaghetti with a slight sweetness. It has hotdogs, 3 meatballs, and enough sauce for the pasta. I would come back here just for the pasta. I would say this is for Sharing.

Beef Stew Omurice - Weve tried this and personally, we do not like Omurice rice, what that means is thst we do not like the Ketchup infused rice that people usually assosciate with Omurice. The beef stew is amazing, tender and flavorful with a couple of pieces of vegetables and covered with an omelette on top. 

Tonkatsu Curry - I would say the Curry itself is quite flavorful, even more so than Coco Ichibanya. It has a big serving size that screams for extra rice. But the Pork Cutlet that they serve with is lacking in salt. I do not know if it is underseasoned or just frozen pork. But I am willing to order just the curry, even without the pork. The pork is just a bonus.

Omusouffle Tonkatsu Curry - takes a while to serve due to it being a souffle and requires patience to let it rise. Served with a small side of butter. Personally, I wouldnt order this again. Not because of the long cooking time, but because it doesnt complement the pork and the curry that much. The omelette souffle is also lacking in salt. Overall, just meh. 

Karaage - I wouldnt order this again. But its not bad. Just not comparable to other Karaage that I have tried in Cebu. It has alot more breading to other Japanese Restos that I have tried. Just ok in flavor.


The bad. Oh boy.

The first time we came here, I ordered the Omu souffle Tonkatsu Curry. I was told I was going to wait up to an hour because of the high traffic of people that are in the restaurant. I accepted, I wanted to taste it. Ive heard alot about it online and I had time so its ok.

45mins later, I was served a Tonkatsu Curry. A completely different dish. The Manager, a guy, then came to apologize for the mistake and told us that they could not serve the Omu Souffle. Its Soft opening so I understood of orders not making sense and being hectic, so I just said I understood. 

The manager then told me ""We cant make the Souffle sir because we have to make the Egg rise in the Pan to reach the desired consistency"" 
Its ok. I know its hard, so I just accepted it and enjoyed my meal. 

Side note! They didnt even tell me they couldnt make the Omusouffle BEFORE they changed my order on my reciept. I think the manager just had a mistake on inputting the order and then tried to lie by telling me they cant make the souffle. 

Second time I came here, I ordered Meatball Bolognese, Omu souffle Tonkatsu Curry, and Beef stew omurice, with the Ketchup rice being substituted with white rice. I made this very clear to the manager because of their mistake the previous time I was here.

They got it wrong. They served it with Ketchup rice and then they tried to remedy that by giving us white rice on the side. Ok. At least they tried. Would have preferred them to remake it and accept their mistake but this is also kinda acceptable.

Then I noticed my Souffle was taking awhile so I asked for them to follow up. I saw a Souffle being carried 5mins later and.....
They sent it to a newer table. Ok, maybe they ordered in advanced. And so I waited again, for about 15mins just to be sure. And still nothing. I followed up again and the Manager was surprised I still havent recieved my dish. She(theres 2 managers) then went to the Kitchen to clarify the mixed up orders (this is all happening in clear view for me). I can tell that they made an honest mistake of who to deliver the dish to. Thats understandable.

She then came to my table and told me that ""We cant make the Souffle sir because we have to make the Egg rise in the Pan to reach the desired consistency"". I would have understood if they just told me the truth. But outright lying? A stupid lie too? Imma have to pass on that.

She then asked if I would be willing to wait another 15mins for the same dish. At this point, Im waiting for an hour or more. I just said I would wait. And so I got my Food after a long time. The Omusouffle was okay.

Overall, I really want to love this place. But this place feels more like a Manipulating Ex who always think theyre right.

My first committee meeting is next Tuesday. It is in advance of my QE2 this summer to give my committee an idea of what I’m doing and to allow me to run a first draft by them. My PI wants to help me through it but is also on vacation all week and (rightly so) will be ignoring his work emails.

A friend of mine just passed away Wednesday. Unexpected, he died in his sleep after he had finished his chemo a week previous and everything was looking good. I’ve known him 20 years and I’m having a rough time. He was at my wedding. He exchanged photos of life constantly… him with his amazing D&D sessions and me with my.. text books and coffee. He were the kind of friends who could talk into the wee hours of the night about just about anything.

Yet.. I till presented my data in my lab meeting. Still came in to work. Still wrote an abstract for an upcoming conference.

But ya’ll… I have refused to let myself grieve. I am missing out on going to the funeral because I keep telling myself I have too much to do. Trying to juggle these huge things with preparing a ton of stuff is really really hard.

Will it be a problem if my committee meeting isn’t perfect? Probably not. But nothing has screamed “you can’t do this” as much as this has. I’m having trouble finding my science language. I’ve only been working on my project for a little over a year and it is my first time working in this particular niche, so all the techniques and knowledge are still newish to me, though I have learned a lot.

I’m mostly just posting because I don’t have anyone that really understands in my life. Even in my friend groups, it is rare to find anyone that schooled beyond a bachelor. So I just needed to write this out. So thank you for listening.",3,1742127163.0,PhDStress,0,1.0,False

Need validation.,"I had a secured IDFC Wow and a Kotak League Rupay. I had got these for Lounge and UPI respectively and it was convenient since I had good family level relationships with both banks. Having used these for 2 years and frequenting this sub I realised I wasn't really earning anything in the name of rewards or cashbacks so I decided to close the secured card (regretting now as it was LTF and Visa Infinite: 1+1 on BMS) and get 2 new cards: SBI Cashback Mastercard and Tata Neu Infinity Rupay.  
I got the SBI one easily with a 90k+ limit but HDFC only gave me a secured Tata Neu plus. Having had both the cards for a couple of weeks I have learned a few things:   
1. Tata Neu app is bs - like the worst shopping or finance app I have ever used. Paytm was a thousand times better at both.  
2. The Neucoin cashback system is too variable and complex. I have yet to understand how can I get the promised 7%.  
3. Even if I do get the 7% back in neucoins, it means I will have to use them instead of the card the next time which I think technically results to an effective return of 3.5% which is less than what SBI offers. (I have also been using my father's Amazon Pay card with prime and at least I can use the cashback in places I won't actually get the 5% CB, so I am using APay wallet when only losing out on the 1% CB transactions.)  
 4. Having a co-branded HDFC card is not a good idea if I'm hoping to get a core card anytime soon. (Based on the discussions on this sub).

Since most my transactions are online, I am pretty content with a straight up 5% from SBI. When I do use UPI it's mostly for chai coffee (lot of txns < INR 100) and it is my understanding that Tata Neu CB doesn't apply to them.

For some reason I could not get the Kiwi card so I am going to keep this card for UPI transactions for a while, but I have decided to close it before the end of the year. Until then I am hoping to find a replacement for a good cashback card for UPI. 

In the near future I am also hoping to get a separate fuel card (fuel spending \~40-45k p.a.) and enter the Amex world. Would value your inputs.",1,1742127124.0,CreditCardsIndia,0,1.0,False

*The announcer’s voice crackles through the speakers again, now tinged with a manic energy, as if they’ve had one too many energy drinks while hunched over their laptop in a dimly lit room.*

Well, well, well, if it isn’t me again, back to carve up Keely Hodgkinson like a Thanksgiving turkey—and trust me, folks, this bird’s got no stuffing worth saving! After I roasted her child-exploiting antics last time, I thought to myself, “There’s gotta be more dirt on this gremlin.” So, I strapped on my metaphorical hazmat suit and dove headfirst into the cesspool of the internet to find more proof of her shadiness. And oh boy, did I strike gold—or rather, a steaming pile of garbage masquerading as gold. I found an interview. A full, mind-numbing ONE HOUR, THIRTY-FIVE MINUTES, AND FORTY-TWO SECONDS of Keely Hodgkinson spewing absolute drivel. Buckle up, because I watched every agonizing second so you don’t have to—and I’ve got thoughts.

First off, who in their right mind thought this interview needed to be that long? I mean, come on! I’ve seen paint dry faster than this snooze-fest. But I powered through, fueled by spite and a triple-shot espresso, because I knew there’d be something in there to prove my point. And guess what? I was right! This interview wasn’t a glimpse into Keely’s “deep thoughts” or “inspiring journey”—it was a masterclass in dodging accountability and slathering on the fake humility thicker than a jar of expired mayonnaise.

The interviewer—some poor sap who probably regretted their life choices by minute five—starts off by asking about her “rise to fame.” And Keely, with that syrupy-sweet tone that makes my skin crawl, launches into this rehearsed spiel about “hard work” and “dedication.” Oh, give me a break! Hard work? The only thing you’ve worked hard at is perfecting your crocodile tears for the camera. She goes on for a solid ten minutes about how “grateful” she is for her fans, but I didn’t hear a single shred of sincerity. It’s like listening to a robot programmed with buzzwords—gratitude, passion, perseverance—blah, blah, BLAH! If I wanted to hear a script read that badly, I’d go watch a middle school play again.

But then—THEN—it gets juicy around the 45-minute mark. The interviewer, probably sensing they’re losing their audience faster than a sinking ship loses rats, decides to throw in a curveball and ask about her “charity work.” Oh, you know, the stuff she’s supposedly doing to “give back” to the community? I perked up so fast I nearly spilled my coffee, because I knew this was gonna be good. And it was. Keely stumbles—actually STUMBLES—over her words for a solid 30 seconds before landing on some vague nonsense about “supporting youth programs.” Youth programs, huh? You mean the same kids you’ve been exploiting for your Instagram cash grabs? The ones you’ve been using as props while you rake in sponsorship dollars? Yeah, I bet you’re “supporting” them straight into your bank account, you absolute leech!

By the time we hit the hour mark, I’m practically feral. She starts droning on about her “training regimen,” and I swear, it’s like listening to paint-by-numbers but for words. “I wake up at 5 a.m., I eat my kale smoothie, I run 10 miles, I meditate”—yawn! Nobody cares, Keely! What I do care about is the part where she “accidentally” lets slip about her “future projects.” Oh yeah, at 1:22:15, she mentions something about a “big collaboration” with a “major brand” to “inspire the next generation.” Inspire the next generation? Or exploit them some more, you soulless husk? I bet this “collaboration” is just another scheme to slap her name on some overpriced garbage and guilt-trip kids into begging their parents to buy it. Disgusting.

The last ten minutes of this interview are just her giggling nervously and dodging any real questions with the grace of a drunk giraffe on rollerblades. The interviewer tries to ask about her controversies—like, oh, I don’t know, the fact that people like ME are onto her—but she just deflects with a “Oh, I don’t focus on the negativity!” Yeah, because focusing on the truth would burn your whole house of cards down, wouldn’t it, Keely?

So there you have it, folks: 1 hour, 35 minutes, and 42 seconds of Keely Hodgkinson proving she’s as shallow as a kiddie pool and twice as slimy. I sat through this garbage fire of an interview so I could bring you the receipts, and let me tell you, I need a shower and a priest after that ordeal. Keely, you thought you could hide behind your fake smiles and scripted answers, but I’m peeling back the layers of your grift one by one. You’re not getting away that easily—this deep dive is just the beginning. I’m coming for you, and I’ve got more time to waste than you’ve got fake tears to cry!

*The announcer slams their laptop shut, muttering curses under their breath.* “One hour, thirty-five minutes, and forty-two seconds I’ll never get back… ugh, I need a nap and a restraining order against her voice.”

1jck2g9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealRepLadies/comments/1jck2g9/how_luxury_lost_its_luster/,How Luxury Lost Its Luster,"Hey, I just finished this super interesting book called Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster. It’s from 2007—almost 20 years old now—but OMG, it still hits hard. Especially when you think about where luxury brands are at today, it’s wild. Here’s some stuff I found pretty interesting after reading it—wanted to share with you all!



1.Where Luxury Came From—Big Brands Started as Tiny Shops

So, like 60% of today’s luxury market is owned by 35 major brands—think Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, Armani, Hermès, Chanel—all raking in over a billion bucks a year. But here’s the tea: most of these fancy brands we obsess over started with humble 18th- and 19th-century artisans making stuff for royalty.

[19th-century artisans](https://preview.redd.it/eacv1ibri1pe1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=eece54f1f43a9834670a64fc6190fa19dcb46d15)

Back when the Bourbons and Bonapartes were ruling France, that’s when modern luxury was born. By the late 19th century, kings and queens were out, the bourgeoisie was in, and this elite circle of European aristocrats and American bigwigs—like the Vanderbilts, Astors, and Whitneys—made luxury their exclusive club. It was like a VIP pass to high society, something to flex if you had the right last name. Plus, they only made small batches—usually custom—and sold to a tiny group of super-rich folks.

Fast forward to now: these companies still carry the founders’ names, but most have been scooped up by business moguls. In the last 20 years, they’ve turned single brands into multi-billion-dollar empires everyone on the planet knows.

 

2. The Secret Behind “Made In” Labels

Luxury brands guard their logos and trademarks like crazy, only giving manufacturers a set number of labels per handbag order. One manufacturer spilled to the author that barely any bags actually say “Made in China”—and if they do, it’s sneaky AF. Like, the label’s sewn into the bottom of an inside pocket or printed on a tiny leather patch the size of a stamp (you’d need a magnifying glass to read it). Most of the time, you’ll see “Made in Italy,” “Made in France,” or “Made in U.K.” slapped on there instead.

https://preview.redd.it/bsbqsjcui1pe1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0707ca9c28bfa18bfdc103f9c2eb1deee5b82ad

Brands pull all kinds of tricks to dodge the “China” tag. Some stick a “Made in China” sticker on the outer packaging, then rip it off when the shipment hits Italy and swap it for a “Made in Italy” one. Others make the whole bag in China except the handles, add those in Italy, and call it “Italian.” Or they’ll do the labor-heavy part of a shoe upper in China, slap a sole on in Italy, and—bam—“Made in Italy.”

 

3. IT Bags—A Marketing Genius Move

Back in the late 18th century, European ladies wore these flowy, pocketless dresses and had to shove their valuables into little bags—the OG handbags. By the late 19th century, sewing and embroidery were a thing, and fancy upper-class women kept their needles in gorgeous little bags. Carrying anything else? Total faux pas—that’s why you had servants.

Modern handbags popped off in the 20th century with women’s suffrage. They screamed independence—like, “I can leave the house whenever, no one needs to know.” Soon, they became a must-have for regular people.

 The “IT bag” thing? That’s only been around for like 20 years—super young and fresh. It’s basically a marketing flex by luxury companies. In the ‘90s, fashion mags were like, “Can’t update your wardrobe every season? Just grab a new bag, babe, and you’re golden.” Brands pushed bags as the ultimate statement piece, making them the star of these wild, in-your-face ad campaigns. Bags turned into this intoxicating obsession.

Today, handbags are so key to a luxury brand’s success that Gucci blamed Yves Saint Laurent’s meh 2005 sales on not having a hit bag that year. Meanwhile, the IT bag took Fendi from a tacky old fur company to a top-tier fashion house. Wild, right?

 

4. Louis Vuitton’s Rise—and Its Dark Spot

Mr. Louis Vuitton was a pro at packing pretty dresses and flashy stuff into trunks, so he became Empress Eugénie’s go-to packer and trunk-maker under Napoleon. That royal stamp of approval? Pure gold. His business blew up. In 1859, he bought land in a Paris suburb to build a little two-room factory—now it’s a touristy LV museum.

 From the late 19th century to pre-WWII, that was the elegant era—maybe luxury’s last real golden age. Louis’s son Georges, at 31, designed the iconic LV checkerboard pattern—chocolate brown and beige, with some squares saying “Marque Louis Vuitton Deposee” in white, showing it’s a legit trademark. That’s when “designer brands” were born.

 But here’s the messy part: during WWII, to keep the lights on, some French luxury and couture shops—including LV—sold to Nazi officers and the wives of French traitors. It’s a family secret LV never wants to talk about, and it didn’t come out until 2004.

 

5. Luxury Boutiques—The “Vertical Integration” Glow-Up

Those fancy flagship stores you see on main streets? They weren’t always a thing. It’s a big reform tied to Louis Vuitton.

 In 1977, Louis Vuitton’s son-in-law, 65-year-old Henry Racamier, took over. He wasn’t a fashion guy—he was a businessman. After reading a ton, he realized retailers—especially franchise dealers—were pocketing the biggest chunk of profits. Back then, most luxury companies were still small, family-run, and kinda clueless about business.

 Racamier said, “Nah,” and kicked out the middlemen. He launched LV-owned boutiques with a “vertical integration” strategy. It was a game-changer—financially, it crushed it. In just a few years, LV’s profits shot up to a wild 40%, while most competitors were stuck at 15-25%. Now, pretty much every luxury brand follows his playbook, controlling everything from top to bottom.

 

6. Luxury’s Big Shift—From Status to Cash

Over the last 30 years, disposable income in rich countries has skyrocketed. People are marrying later, leaving more cash to splurge on themselves. Plus, they’re more educated and traveled than their parents, so they’ve got a taste for the finer things.

Big-shot CEOs and financiers sniffed the opportunity. They swooped in, snatched brands from aging founders or their less-savvy heirs, and turned family businesses into corporate machines. They standardized everything—stores, staff uniforms, products, even the coffee cups at meetings. Then they targeted the “middle market”—a huge mix of people: teachers, salespeople, tech entrepreneurs, mansion-dwellers, tacky nouveaux riches, even sketchy millionaires.

Luxury execs call it “democratizing luxury” to make it “accessible to all.” Sounds noble, right? Nah, it’s just a slick way to rake in more cash.

 

7. Charles Worth—The First Fashion Godfather

Charles Worth is basically the dad of modern haute couture. In the mid-19th century, women wore these huge, poofy dresses with layers of petticoats underneath. Then Worth invented the crinoline—game-changer.

https://preview.redd.it/0ybq2tnvj1pe1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fd14a3c1e1a48716c26fde0bf0ca9d423c7f976

He’s the “father” because he didn’t just make what people ordered. Every season, he designed a collection for customers to pick from. He was one of the first to throw fashion shows and slap his signature label on clothes. He decided what was hot, and everyone followed. Historian Hippolyte Taine said, “Women would drop anything to be dressed by him.” Iconic.

I went out to dig up one of his designs—check it out and let me know what you think of the vibe! which fashion godfather’s got that kinda clout these days?

https://preview.redd.it/6nw22qj1k1pe1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a6d3818d0cb9065ddc3b247331a5bd1b2859611

8. Oscars—The Ultimate Luxury Ad Spot

The Oscars are the glitziest celeb fest and the biggest promo opp for luxury brands. Harry Winston’s jewelry rep, Carol Brodie, told the author that if a celeb rocks your stuff on the red carpet, “sales spike every month” for years. “We only spend like a million bucks on ads in the U.S. a year,” he said, “but ask any American who Harry Winston is, and they’re like, ‘Oh, the jeweler who dresses up stars!’” Outfitting celebs is the best way to get eyes on you.

Uma Thurman put Prada on the map, Charlize Theron boosted Vera Wang, Halle Berry made Elie Saab a name. Sometimes, celeb agencies even sign deals with brands—rules like: brooch above the waist, hair up to show earrings, say the brand name 2-4 times on national TV, and if anyone asks, name-drop loud and clear.

These days, the Oscars totally don’t have that kinda crazy exposure anymore.

 

9. Asia’s Biggest consumer

When it comes to luxury’s top market, you’d think China, right? Nope—this book’s from 2007, before China’s shoppers took over. Back then, it was all about Japan.

The stats are nuts:

A: Japanese shoppers, at home and abroad, made up half of global luxury spending.

B: 85% of Japanese people called themselves middle-class—post-war class lines blurred, and they could all afford luxury.

C: 40% of Japanese owned LV stuff.

Everyone knows Japan loves LV. In the ‘70s, their economy boomed, disposable income shot up, and their obsession with quality drove them to these fancy, well-made goods. But Japan’s luxury sales were weird back then—no brand boutiques. Instead, Japanese traders would hit up Paris stores, buy in bulk at retail price (!!), ship it back, and sell it for 3-4 times more. So blunt, not very “mysterious Japan” vibes. (Though some brands still use local distributors today—it’s a global oddity.)

LV’s Paris store kept selling out to swarms of Japanese buyers. Finally, they opened shops in Japan, charging 1.5 times the Paris price. To cater to them, duty-free retail (like DFS) popped off. Hawaii became a hotspot—close to Japan, American flair, even took yen. LV and others set up stores there, hired Japanese-speaking staff, teamed up with tour groups, and extended hours—all for Japanese shoppers.

So, over the years, China’s taken the crown as Asia’s biggest luxury market, but lately, its luxury scene’s been kinda tanking. Which country’s got the best shot at snagging the top spot next?

Last a funny bit from the book: A Japanese bought an evening gown, found a tiny thread loose, and swapped it at the store. The owner tested it—gave it to a French woman, who saw the thread but was like, “I’ll just cut it off, it’s fine.” Then an American tried it on and bought it without even noticing. What are we doing wrong, lol?
