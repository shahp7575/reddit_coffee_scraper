1otoljn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1otoljn/aita_for_avoiding_my_mil_and_sil_because_they_act/,AITA for avoiding my MIL and SIL because they act like best friends and make me feel invisible?,"I (28F) am a foreigner living in Turkey with my husband (28M). We’ve been married for 3 years. We currently live with his family my MIL, FIL, his brother (BIL, 28M), and his brother’s wife (SIL, 23F). BIL and SIL have been married for about 3 months.

I work from home from 8 AM to 5 PM, so I usually wake up early and start my day. SIL usually wakes up around 12 or 1 PM. When she gets up, my MIL already has breakfast prepared. SIL eats, then she and my MIL sit in the living room watching Turkish series, drinking coffee, and chatting for hours. That’s basically their whole day.

Even though I work full-time, I still help around the house whenever I can. I usually help in the kitchen and clean the house during my free time. SIL mostly just cleans her own room and doesn’t help much with anything else.

One time, my MIL went to another city for a week because her brother passed away. During that time, I was the one cooking meals, and SIL helped me a bit when preparing dinner. When MIL came back, she asked if SIL had helped while she was away. I said yes, she did, but I didn’t elaborate. Later, MIL asked my husband, and he told her that SIL mostly just cleaned her own room. FIL even mentioned that SIL seemed distant and that I was the one who stayed close and helped.

Even though MIL sometimes says nice things to me, I don’t fully trust her because she has a tendency to speak kindly to people’s faces but then talk badly behind their backs. I’ve seen her do this before, so I can’t be sure she doesn’t do the same about me.

At home, MIL and SIL are like best friends. They wake up late, eat breakfast together, then spend most of the day watching TV, talking, and drinking coffee. Meanwhile, I’m working and doing my part around the house. Most days, I eat breakfast alone. Occasionally, MIL texts me to join her for breakfast, which I appreciate but she always invites SIL too, and they end up talking and laughing the whole time while I just sit there quietly. I understand some Turkish, but they rarely include me in their conversations. It makes me feel left out and uncomfortable.

Because of all this, I don’t usually help in the kitchen when SIL is there. I only help when MIL is alone, because that’s when I feel more comfortable. I honestly wanted to reach out and join them, but every time I do, I end up feeling invisible and alone.

Another thing that bothers me is that before BIL and SIL got married, BIL once asked me where I buy my clothes because he wanted to get something similar for his girlfriend (who is now SIL). Since their marriage, SIL has started copying almost everything I wear, clothes, shoes, pajamas, even how I style myself. It feels strange and makes me even more uncomfortable.

Because of all this, I’ve started keeping to myself more. I eat separately most of the time and focus on my work instead of forcing interactions that leave me feeling excluded.

Now I’m wondering, am I being rude or distant by avoiding my MIL and SIL? Am I the a-hole for not wanting to join them for meals or help in the kitchen when I already do my part and just end up feeling left out every time I try?",1,1762805624.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I’ve always loved Markdown — especially its simplicity and portability. It’s great not having to worry about formatting or export issues.  
But I’ve also always been drawn to the idea of a feed, and used to jot down random reflections on Twitter (back when it was still called that).

So I combined the two and started experimenting with the idea of a note-taking app in Markdown that blends the power of Markdown with the feed-style of Twitter (X). I’m still developing it [here](http://tivor.me), and I’d love to hear your feedback on how it can be improved or what features I could add.

1otoizn,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1otoizn/building_out_gift_bags_for_the_team/,Building out gift bags for the team.,"First year managing a new MSP and we've seen some decent growth. I want to do something nice for my team for the holidays in the form of some tech centric goody bags/swag bags. Currently have a team of 8. 

I've sent an email to all of our vendors to see if they'll chip in something for the bag, but not holding my breath for a whole lot of participation. This will be coming out of my pocket and not the companies bottom line. Let's assume I'll need to stick to a budget of around $25 - $30 out of pocket per bag (and I'll probably need to grab the bag too).



**All that said: What would you as techs want out of something like that from your manager?** Candies? Cables? Coffee? Something that doesn't start with the letter C? 



Gotta keep it professional and stuff that I can buy 8 of. Was thinking maybe some energy drinks, maybe flash drives if I see some good black Friday deals. Already have plans to take the team out for dinner and do a holiday party (and bonuses) and all that jazz, so this is just a little something extra to show my appreciation.

Let me know what you think and hoping this doesn't infringe on rule 8!

Would be nice if we could get actual snow, but it has still yet to come, despite what the forecast is saying. While I am locked up in my office with a nice cup of coffee, work is quite boring currently. So what better chance to post and see what I can find! I am always looking for new people to talk with, everyone is unique and interesting in their own ways. A bit about myself to start things off: 

* Live in Canada (MST timezone) and work as an accountant. I am quite left leaning, and while I can get along with most people, I do not tolerant any hateful or bigoted thinking 
* For my freetime, you will mostly find me hanging out with online friends, gaming, reading, or watching something like Youtube, Animes, or TV shows. Game wise I have been playing Hades 2, EU5, Dwarf Fortress, WoW, FFXIV, and Rimworld lately. Honestly just play anything I enjoy and am not locked too much in genres. 
* Have recently gotten back into curling as well. Played it as a teenager but find myself enjoying it much more now. Probably has something to do with not being a moody, impatient teenager anymore. Keep bruising my knee though so need more practice on that 
* Music is also a big part of my life. Just so much easier to express my thoughts and feelings through songs. I would say Alternative and Indie rock are some of my preferred genres, but if I hear something and like it I will add it to my playlist. I am always down for sharing song recommendations and sharing/making playlists to swap! 
* Recently have been trying to learn how to do some photography to help better capture the views I see. It's... going as best as it can with an older digital camera, but hey, it is getting me or out and about. 
* I do have interest in subjects such as geography, geology, and history. I like just pulling open a map, picking a random spot, and seeing what I can learn about it. I do have interests in other things as well, those are just a few I have always had a stronger focus on. 

With all that said, really I can just message/talk about anything. I am quite an open book, and there are very few topics I am uncomfortable with, and when I am I make it known. I am open to getting to know just about anyone, just as long as you are a decent person.",1,1762805395.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Car wear and tear rough guess 600. We also stop paying a sitter for the evenings when daycare hours do not match, that was 1,100. Tax impact helps more than I thought, lower bracket plus less state tax about 2,300. Net hit after all that is around 1,340 a year or 112 a month. Then we counted soft stuff that is still money, fewer colds so fewer copays maybe 200 and one of us can cover apartment maintenance and deliveries that used to create missed work. Health insurance stays the same for us since employer covers at 80 percent if over 30 hours. If plan changed that would kill the idea fast. We decided to try 6 months.

Your financial support truly helps push development forward and lets me dedicate more time to making this game better.

**Where We're At & What's Next:**

The game is in a pretty stable state right now, but there's still a TON of work ahead before official launch. Here's what the beta roadmap looks like:

**Refinement & Redesign:**

* Major balancing changes across the board
* Bug fixes and stability improvements
* Redesigning core systems like Village, Enchanting, Mounts, and more

**Missing Features:**

* Crafting system
* More event types
* Additional dungeon varieties
* Guild buildings
* And much more in the pipeline

**Behind the Scenes:**

* Building out management and moderation tools
* Backend systems for smoother game operation
* All the invisible stuff that makes everything run smoothly

I'm giving 100% to this project and will keep grinding to make it the best it can be. The journey is far from over, and I hope you'll stick around to see where Realm of Dungeons goes!

Me (23F) and my ex-boyfriend (28M) were together for about 3.5 years, started dating when I was 18, and he was 24. Our time together was great, we never argued, had a lot in common, everything was overall great. We met through university, so had a lot in common with our jobs, which was really nice. The only major issue we had back then was the lack of space that we had. Long story short, he could only stay at my place (he lived with his parents), and at my place, we had to share a single bed, it really wasn’t great, and put a huge strain on our relationship. Over time, our sex life became non existent, due to the lack of space, and stress from university. We became distant, argued more over petty crap, and saw each other less and less. I wasn’t sexually attracted to him at all, and we called it off summer 2024 (though it was a civil breakup, we were very amicable). 

I loved him so much, he was everything I could ask for in a partner, super super gentle, sweet, literally wouldn’t hurt a fly, so respectful and caring, he has a great job, great hobbies, has a wonderful group of friends, overall a great partner. I really did love him, but over time, I started to feel like I was carrying the weight of the whole relationship. He wasn’t very assertive or proactive, so I always ended up being the one who had to initiate everything, plans, conversations, dates, anything. It made me lose attraction, as I couldn’t rely on him to take the lead sometimes or meet me halfway. 

Fast forward to now, we’ve been in touch for the last few months, texting every couple of days, and we’ve both revisited the idea of trying again, because he has his own place now. In theory, our biggest problem (lack of space) has gone. He’s picked up wonderful new hobbies, and seems to be thriving after moving out. He tells me he’s done a lot of reflection, and fully recognises the weight I carried, and how he should’ve done different. It’s a shame he’s telling me all this now, but he genuinely does seem remorseful, and sounds like he’s grown. He still remains everything I’m looking for in a partner, but i don’t have that sexual attraction, at all. We’ve met up a few times for coffee, and I can really appreciate he’s handsome, good looking, but I can’t imagine myself as much as kissing him? Does this mean there’s no point in trying again? 

My mum thinks I’ll regret it if we don’t try again, and says worst case, we call it off again. But others are telling me I’m settling due to the safety and comfort I feel from him. And even when I entertain the idea of trying again, I still have this niggling doubt, and I keep remembering I’m not sexually attracted to him? Could I get that sexual attraction back over time, if I spend more time with him? Am I wasting time going back? I’m really really stuck, and I keep going back and forth, and would just love someone’s opinion from the outside.

I stayed at 21c hotel, free museam was ok.  I thought the room was a little tired but for 2 nights it was fine and clean and quiet enough.    I love Spanish tapas and enjoyed Taberna on West Main.
The Durham Food Hall was cool. Bagels were small, which is not a criticism, just an observation.
Duke Gardens were amazing and I can't believe they are free!  I walked around the beautiful campus too-- god those students are lucky-- hope to teach there one day.

He *morphs* into a pile of worms in a tuxedo, then snaps back into his usual form with a devilish bow.

# ALASTOR

(from the shadows, amused)  
Now this... this is new.

The **Radio Demon** steps forward, eyes glinting, intrigued.

# ALASTOR

Your aura smells of mildew and... cable TV reruns. You’re not from this circle.

# BEETLEJUICE

(puffing his chest)  
Bingo, old-timey! I’m freelance. Used to work upstairs in the Netherworld, but now I’m seeing what Hell’s got on the menu. Gotta say, the ambience here?  
**(sniffs)**  
A little *too classy*. Needs more roaches.

He *pops open his chest like a lunchbox*, pulls out a horn section of demonic rats, and they play a ragtime sting.

# CHARLIE

(grasping for patience)  
So... you’re *interested* in redemption?

# BEETLEJUICE

(cackling)  
Redemption?! Oh, sweetheart, I’m here to *network*. Maybe cause a little chaos, prank some soul-dealers, eat a sentient chair or two. But hey — if playing nice gets me a room and some popcorn, I’ll *pretend* to be a good boy.

He suddenly grows angel wings made of moldy shower curtains and does a mock-innocent halo pose.

# VAGGIE

(to Charlie, whispering)  
He’s *worse* than Husk.

# HUSK

(from the bar, without turning)  
I heard that.

# ALASTOR

(chuckling darkly)  
I like him.

# BEETLEJUICE

(to Alastor)  
And *I* like your style, dead-boy. Maybe we collaborate. You broadcast horror, I *am* horror. A match made in Hell!

They *shake hands* — and a giant electric eel erupts between them. Both cackle.

# CHARLIE

(sighing but smiling nervously)  
Well… welcome to the Hazbin Hotel, Mr. Beetlejuice.

# BEETLEJUICE

(finger guns)  
Call me B.J. Just don’t say it three times unless you want a musical number.

He *snaps*, and the whole lobby transforms into a twisted carnival tent, complete with a demonic carousel and cotton candy made of screaming souls.

# BEETLEJUICE

(grinning wide)  
Now, where’s the karaoke machine?

**SMASH CUT TO BLACK.**

can 

# INT. HAZBIN HOTEL – COMMON ROOM – NIGHT

The hotel is a *wreck*. Decorations are rearranged into tacky haunted house props, several walls are now *living*, and an organ made of bones won’t stop playing itself in the background. Beetlejuice’s ""personal improvements.""

The staff sit or pace around a couch area in a *debrief circle* — drinks in hand, looks of exhaustion or pure irritation on their faces.

A sign reads:  
**“Emergency Staff Meeting – Topic: ‘Beetlejuice’”**

# CHARLIE

(trying to stay upbeat, rubbing temples)  
Okay. Let’s all just—talk about it. He’s… a *lot*. Maybe if we *understand* him, we can *handle* him.

# VAGGIE

(handle? furious)  
Charlie, the guy tried to sell me *a fake soul insurance policy.* Claimed it covered spontaneous combustion and “narrative betrayal!” I kicked him through a window and he just oozed back in through the plumbing!

# ANGEL DUST

(chuckling, puffing a smoke)  
Yeah, he offered me a *“cross-dimensional marketing deal”* for adult plushies. Called it ""Sin-stagram Live."" Said I’d get royalties in slime coins. Slime. Freakin'. Coins.

He looks vaguely impressed.

# HUSK

(grumbling)  
He tried to cheat me at poker. *Twice*.  
First time he shape-shifted his hand into a royal flush. Second time he replaced all my cards with coupons for ""free hauntings."" I *almost* respected the hustle… till he turned my tail into a phone charger.

He downs his drink.

# NIFFTY

(rapid-fire, giggling but clearly stressed)  
He called me “Toots,” then “Sweet Cheeks,” then “1950s Barbie’s hallucination!” Said I should “lighten up” and turned *every spoon in the kitchen into a tiny version of himself*! THEY'RE STILL LAUGHING!!

We hear faint tiny giggles from inside a drawer. Niffty shudders.

# ALASTOR

(smiling too much)  
Ahhh, now *this* is entertainment.

# VAGGIE

(glaring)  
Of course *you’d* enjoy this.

# ALASTOR

(mirthful)  
He is, in a word, *unhinged*. His power lacks structure, his behavior defies logic — and yet there’s… a certain charisma to his chaos. Reminds me of old vaudeville acts… if the act was possessed by a sewage-dwelling poltergeist with attention deficit disorder.

# CHARLIE

(defensive, still hopeful)  
I mean… I think he *could* change if he *wanted* to…

# VAGGIE

Charlie. He *teleported your dad’s throne room into the hotel lobby*.

# CUT TO:

Lucifer Morningstar — currently trapped in an enormous gold armchair covered in green slime, smoking furiously.

# LUCIFER

(monotone, regal rage)  
He called me “Lucy-boy” and said I had “main villain vibes.” I am *not* a vibe.

# BACK TO: COMMON ROOM

# ANGEL DUST

(laughing)  
Okay, okay, but you gotta admit — the *tap-dancing skeleton flash mob* he summoned in the elevator?  
Kinda banger.

# NIFFTY

*THEY* STOLE MY MOP!

# HUSK

And he keeps showing up in the mirror when I shave, saying, “Don’t trust the cat, he’s plotting something.”

Pause.

# HUSK

Which is true, but it’s rude to *say* it.

Suddenly, a puff of green smoke explodes from the fireplace and **BEETLEJUICE** erupts from it, now wearing a bathrobe and holding a fake Emmy statue.

# BEETLEJUICE

(taking a bow)  
Wow! I’d like to thank the Academy of Bad Decisions for this award — and also the fine staff of this haunted motel for being such *wonderful test subjects!*

# VAGGIE

(fuming)  
This is a *hotel!*

# BEETLEJUICE

(faux confused)  
Really? Coulda fooled me. I’ve seen haunted houses run by meat puppets that were better organized!

He winks at Niffty, blows a kiss to Angel Dust, and *somehow* gives Alastor a high five *without touching him*.

# CHARLIE

Beetlejuice — can you *please* stop messing with everyone?

# BEETLEJUICE

(grinning)  
Hey, I’m just being *me*, kid! That’s what you’re all about, right? “Second chances”? “Redemption”? Well, I’m gonna need a *lot* of ‘em!

He spins midair and turns into a cuckoo clock with his own face popping out.

# BEETLEJUICE

(voice from clock)  
**Cuckoo!** Time for *more chaos!*

# CUT TO:

Everyone collectively groaning. Angel Dust faceplants into the couch. Vaggie starts sharpening her spear. Husk walks toward the bar without comment.

Alastor’s smile grows wider.

# ALASTOR

(to Charlie, calmly)  
I propose we keep him.

# VAGGIE

(muttering)  
I propose we *exorcise* him.

# CHARLIE

(sighs)  
Let’s… table both ideas.

**SMASH CUT TO BLACK**  
—with Beetlejuice’s laugh echoing like a bad carnival ride malfunction.

  


# INT. HAZBIN HOTEL – BASEMENT (CHARLIE’S OFFICE) – NIGHT

Everyone’s gathered around a chalkboard with Beetlejuice’s face scrawled in green crayon and red warning signs around it. Charlie looks tired. Vaggie looks murderous. Husk is holding a “World’s Worst Idea” mug.

At the center of the chaos: BEETLEJUICE, lounging upside-down in midair, drinking *sentient soda* and playing kazoo music from his ear.

# VAGGIE

(serious)  
Okay. We've all agreed. We can’t kill him, we can’t contain him, and Alastor won’t stop *encouraging* him.

# ALASTOR

(cheerfully)  
He’s the most fun I’ve had since 1947.

# ANGEL DUST

(stretching, smug)  
So we’re giving him to the Vees?

# CHARLIE

(reluctantly)  
Just for a *visit*. Maybe if he focuses on them, we can get the hotel back to normal and—well, they deserve a little karma.

# HUSK

(flatly)  
This is a war crime.

# NIFFTY

(grinning too wide)  
I packed him snacks! And by snacks I mean cursed teeth and glitter bombs.

# BEETLEJUICE

(perking up)  
So lemme get this straight… You *want* me to go harass a bunch of egotistical, power-hungry, corporate sinners who think they’re better than everyone?

# ALL (except Charlie)

Yes.

# BEETLEJUICE

(grinning like a maniac)  
**Say. Less.**

  


# INT. VALENTINO’S STUDIO – LATER

A sleek, neon-drenched penthouse office full of velvet, vice, and overcompensating décor. Valentino is sipping blood wine while yelling at an intern. Vox is watching himself on 12 monitors. Velvette is recording a new dance for HellTok.

# VOX

(snarling)  
I *still* don’t know how that stupid redemption hotel’s trending over my studio channel.

# VALENTINO

(smirking)  
We’ll crush ‘em. I’ve got dirt on half their guests and the other half owe me *favors*.

Suddenly, the flat screens static out. The air ripples with green smoke. A *gothic circus overture* begins.

**CRASH!**  
Through the ceiling, BEETLEJUICE lands in a *sparkly meat-suit mariachi outfit*, holding a bouquet of snakes and grinning ear to ear.

# BEETLEJUICE

(cheerfully)  
**Hello, fellow degenerates!** Who’s ready for a brand merger with absolute madness?

# VOX

(glitching)  
Who the *hell* are you?

# BEETLEJUICE

(pointing finger guns)  
The ghost with the most, the slime with the time, the demon of every HR department's worst nightmare.

He *eats* one of the bouquet snakes and throws confetti made of expired contracts.

# VALENTINO

(leaning back, unimpressed)  
Cute entrance. You a new mascot?

# BEETLEJUICE

(suddenly behind him)  
Nope! I’m your *problem* now.

He pokes Valentino’s shoulder, turning it into a *televised cooking show* featuring Valentino as a screaming ham roast. Velvette films it gleefully.

# VELVETTE

Oooooh this content is *insane*. You're like Vox’s ego and Angel Dust’s wardrobe had a baby.

# VOX

(angry, glitching harder)  
Stop touching my network!

# BEETLEJUICE

*Your* network? Bro, I turned your broadcast tower into a banana. Look out your window.

**CUT TO:**  
Outside, the once-mighty Vox Tower is now a massive, *winking* banana with static antennas and a neon sign reading “PEEL ME DADDY.”

# VOX

(screaming)  
**YOU PIECE OF—**

# BEETLEJUICE

(innocent)  
Whoa, whoa, easy! You’re gonna overclock your circuits. Here — try my patented BeetleJuice cleanse.

He pulls out a blender that screams when opened and dumps it over Vox. Vox’s screens begin playing *Dora the Explorer* reruns dubbed in *reverse demonic Latin*.

# VALENTINO

(pulling a gun)  
I’ve had enough of this freak.

He fires — and Beetlejuice's body splits apart like a piñata, spilling out insects, marbles, and 3 VHS tapes of “Hell’s Funniest Executions.”

# BEETLEJUICE

(from behind them, already back)  
Careful, Tino-baby. That attitude’s how people end up as cursed NFTs.

He winks, and suddenly Valentino’s jacket screams every time he moves.

# VELVETTE

(still filming, delighted)  
You’re horrible. I *love* it.

# BEETLEJUICE

(grinning at her)  
Stick with me, sweetheart. We’ll make *hell history*. Or at least a 10-part miniseries with zero plot and maximum lawsuits!

  


# INT. HAZBIN HOTEL – COMMON ROOM – SAME TIME

Everyone is relaxing in relative peace for the first time all day. The organ has stopped screaming. The walls are no longer melting. There’s even a *pleasant smell* in the air.

# CHARLIE

(smiling)  
It’s quiet.

# HUSK

(relieved)  
Too quiet.

# ANGEL DUST

(stretching)  
I give it a day before he breaks one of their faces. Maybe two.

# VAGGIE

(smirking)  
We should send him a thank-you card.

# ALASTOR

(grinning)  
We should send *popcorn*.

  


# INT. V-STUDIOS – NOW PURE CHAOS

Vox is a literal walking antenna. Valentino is trying to pry screaming money off his suit. Velvette is now co-hosting a dance battle show with Beetlejuice, who’s somehow cloned himself five times.

# BEETLEJUICE

(laughing with Velvette)  
Next episode: *Pogo Stick Russian Roulette!* You shoot, I bounce!

# VOX

(off-screen)  
**GET. HIM. OUT. OF. HERE!!**

  


**TO BE CONTINUED...**  
(*probably when the Vees beg Charlie to take him back.*)

  
INT. HAZBIN HOTEL – LOBBY – DAY

The hotel is back to its eerie-but-functional peace. No giant laughing spoon armies. No haunted mariachi snakes. Just... peace.

Charlie is arranging flowers. Husk is asleep at the bar. Angel Dust is scrolling on Hellgram. Vaggie is cautiously enjoying the stillness. Niffty hums while polishing blood off the chandelier.

Then—

**BOOM!**

The front doors are blown open with a glitchy *snap* of static and smoke.

Enter the **Vees**:

* **Vox**, twitching, covered in wires and feathers for some reason.
* **Valentino**, twitching in a fur coat that's *sobbing*.
* **Velvette**, shaking glitter out of her hair, eyes twitching.

They look like they’ve been *through it*.

# CHARLIE

(startled, then cautious)  
Oh. Uh. Welcome?

# VOX

(marching in)  
Where is he.

# VALENTINO

(gritting his teeth)  
We want to return your… your *freakshow.*

# VELVETTE

(shaking a bottle of glitter)  
He turned my followers into sentient emoji. *They won't stop dancing.*

# ANGEL DUST

(sipping)  
Sounds like a *you* problem.

# VOX

Listen, Morningstar. We’re willing to *negotiate*. Take him back and we’ll erase *all* your hotel’s blacklisted bans from our broadcast lists.

# VALENTINO

We’ll even stop sending exorcist ads to your guests.

# VAGGIE

(sarcastically)  
Wow. You’ll stop actively trying to destroy us. How *generous.*

# CHARLIE

(sincere but firm)  
He’s not officially a guest anymore. He just kind of... wandered off. Technically, he’s your problem now.

# VOX

*He took over my entire digital grid.* My entire brand now runs on haunted *slime*. My name shows up on search engines as **“BOOGLEJUICE.”**

# VALENTINO

And every time I blink, he changes the *laws of physics*. I sneezed this morning and aged three years.

# ANGEL DUST

(stifling laughter)  
He really *is* the ghost with the most.

# VELVETTE

(crazed)  
He made me host a talent show called **“So You Think You Can Haunt?”**  
I had to *judge a banshee twerking contest.* I haven’t blinked in twelve hours!

# ALASTOR

(appearing suddenly, delightfully eerie)  
Oh, how delightful! How *entirely deserved*. May I recommend installing mirrors lined with holy water? He *loves* those.

# VOX

(glitching worse)  
This isn’t a joke! He *turned our base into a funhouse dimension!* We’re being harassed by *alternate versions of ourselves!* Vox-A-Tron tried to marry me!

# VAGGIE

So what do you want *us* to do about it?

# VALENTINO

Take. Him. Back.

# CHARLIE

(flatly)  
No.

# VOX

We’re willing to pay. Whatever it takes.

He gestures, and a glowing suitcase appears — filled with rare demon contracts, enchanted currency, and golden soul vials.

# BEETLEJUICE

(suddenly appearing inside the suitcase)  
**""Sold!""**  
—Wait, who am I kidding? I’m *priceless.*

He stretches out like a balloon animal, pops into a tux, and lands between Vox and Valentino with arms around both.

# BEETLEJUICE

Miss me, boys?

# VOX

(softly)  
I was *never happy.* But now I understand true *misery.*

# VALENTINO

Please. We’re *begging you.*

# CHARLIE

Sorry. Hotel policy says we *can’t* accept cursed beings after they’ve been processed by another facility.

# HUSK

(smirking from the bar)  
That and we *really don’t want to.*

# VELVETTE

(snarling)  
Fine! Then we’re declaring a social cold war! You’ll never trend again!

# ALASTOR

(cheerfully)  
Oh, but I believe our hotel has already gone *viral*. In fact… we’re trending *because* of him.

He gestures toward the lobby’s TV, where HellTube plays:

>

# VELVETTE

(soul breaking)  
…It’s my most watched video.

# BEETLEJUICE

(arm still around her)  
Awww, see? I bring people *together.* Through shared trauma and unspeakable slime.

# CHARLIE

(smiling sweetly)  
Thanks for stopping by! Door’s right there. Feel free to scream on your way out.

# VOX

(to himself)  
I’m going to invent time travel just to strangle the version of me that let him in.

The Vees shuffle out in utter defeat.

# BEETLEJUICE

(waving)  
Come back soon! I’ll save you a seat at the next cursed dinner theater! The chicken screams when you chew!

The door slams behind them.

Beat.

# CHARLIE

(to the staff)  
He’s still not *staying*, right?

# BEETLEJUICE

(sipping floating coffee)  
Oh don’t worry, toots — I’m a *freelancer*. Just crashing ‘til the next train to Who-Knows-Where-Hell.

# ANGEL DUST

(to Vaggie)  
We just used the Vees as a *dumpster*.

1oto767,https://i.redd.it/mcz6jqb0ih0g1.png,1000 Users Milestone After 4 Months of Solo Dev!,"Just reached 1000 registered users on my solo project, UI-Based mobile multiplayer RPG.

**What I'm Building:**

Realm of Dungeons is a UI-based multiplayer RPG inspired by classic games like Gladiatus and Shakes & Fidget. It has retro browser game feel, with modern multiplayer features, dungeons, PvP, guilds, equipment progression, and community-driven beta development packed in mobile app.

I've been working on this solo for the past 14 months with 4 months of ongoing beta, pouring hundreds of hours into development. 

The community has been absolutely incredible, active Discord server, constant feedback, and genuinely passionate players helping shape the game.

**Current State:**

The game is in a stable beta state with regular updates, but there's still a long road ahead before official launch.

**What's on the Beta Roadmap:**

*Refinement & Redesign:*

* Major balancing changes across systems
* Bug fixes and stability improvements
* Redesigning core features like Village, Enchanting, Mounts

*Missing Features to Add:*

* Crafting system
* More event types and dungeon varieties
* Guild buildings
* And a lot more planned content

*Behind the Scenes:*

* Management and moderation tools
* Backend infrastructure for scalability
* All the invisible systems that keep things running smoothly

**The Reality:**

I'm constantly worried about matching player expectations and delivering updates fast enough. But the wholesome messages, feedback, and financial support from the community genuinely fuel my motivation every day. It's an amazing feeling knowing people believe in what I'm building.

I'm giving 100% to this project and committed to seeing it through. If you're interested in following along or trying it out, I'd love to have you!

I'm Olly, I've been GM'ing for about 4/5 ish years now and my standard play group has unfortunately fizzled out over the past year and looking for new people!

I'm happy to run modules, and published adventures but I've got a world that I would love to see players run-around in. I'm hoping to play around 3/4 times a month pretty consistently and looking for up-to 6 people. I'm absolutely happy to run multiple games and overall just looking for some TTRPG enjoyers to have a laugh with, and make some really entertaining, funny and fufilling stories together.

I'd be aiming to run a pre-session 0 hangout, meet everyone and go for drink, lunch or coffee somewhere and make sure we all gel together! This is my first post on this subreddit and everything I've read makes me hopeful to find some new friends!

If you would be interested in playing please drop me a DM. I've included a google doc link to a brief world introduction but happy to play anything and everything!

1otny1p,https://dailyboulder.com/trump-praises-himself-for-lower-grocery-prices-then-cnn-pulls-the-receipts/,Trump's 'Victory Lap' on Affordability Met with Skepticism and Statistics,"Trump recently heralded his administration's performance on the economy, specifically claiming a significant reduction in grocery prices and a marked improvement in affordability. Speaking to reporters on Friday, the former President dismissed criticisms regarding rising costs, instead pivoting to blame both the media—which he dubbed ""fake news""—and the current administration of President Joe Biden.

""If you look at affordability... prices are down under the Trump administration and they’re down substantially,"" Trump asserted, adding that his administration ""did a great job on groceries and affordability."" He further claimed that media outlets were deliberately avoiding coverage of this purported accomplishment because it undermined a narrative of economic struggle.

However, these claims immediately faced a robust challenge from CNN's Abby Phillip, who used her platform to present official government data that paints a starkly different picture. Phillip categorically stated that Trump's claims were ""simply not true"" and backed her assertion with figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

The BLS data clearly indicated that grocery prices are not lower; they have risen since Trump’s inauguration. Specifically, compared to the previous September, the cost of food has increased by 2.7 percent. The surge is even more pronounced in specific categories:

The only acknowledgment of increasing prices from Trump came in the form of an announcement via social media: a request for the Justice Department to investigate meatpacking companies for ""Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing and Price Manipulation,"" which he framed as a crackdown on corporate malfeasance rather than a reflection of broader inflationary pressures.

The economic unease extends beyond the grocery aisle, and public opinion seems to align with the BLS data, not the former President's optimism. Phillip highlighted a CBS News/YouGov poll showing that 62 percent of Americans believe the cost of food is rising, while a mere 7 percent believe it is decreasing. The clear majority of the public, therefore, is directly experiencing price hikes.

Furthermore, the economic snapshot offered by the data included worrisome employment figures. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicated that U.S. layoffs surged to a two-decade high in October, with over 150,000 jobs cut in that month alone. This spike was partly attributed to the growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into business operations—an industry Trump has enthusiastically championed.

With a million layoffs recorded so far this year—a 65 percent increase year-over-year—Phillip concluded that the economic signals suggest belt-tightening and a reality far removed from the President's celebratory narrative. While Trump continues to tout economic success, both government statistics and public surveys suggest that for many American consumers, the story playing out at the checkout counter is one of increasing financial pressure.",1,1762804192.0,politics_NOW,0,1.0,False

1. What can be done to proactively prevent or minimize the effect it has on skin texture and laxity?

2. I’d prefer not to be on it long term. I’ve read that some people use their time on semiglutides to revamp their eating habits/diet. I don’t exactly binge, and I don’t have a lot of food noise (I barely have more than coffee for breakfast, don’t have lunch regularly, dinner is my main meal, but I do have a preference for less healthy meals when I eat (less veg, more meat/fried stuff/creamy stuff). How would you suggest preventing weight rebound after getting off it? Will I get cravings worse than I had it before when I stop (even if I taper off)?

It’s the way social media, algorithms, and our phones have all become intertwined that’s created the mess we’re living in today. Carrying a phone used to be harmless — it barely affected society at all. Back in the MySpace and early Facebook days, social media was *fun* because the algorithms were simple. They showed us updates from our circle of friends. Our FOMO came from *not* being there in person — from missing a hangout or an event. In a strange way, social media back then actually encouraged us to go outside, go on dates, and stay present.

Even when we had MySpace or Facebook on our phones, there wasn’t constant stimulation. You’d check once a day, maybe twice, and things would actually be *different* the next day. But then came **short-form content**, **the algorithmic feeds**, **Instagram Reels**, and **TikTok** — and that basically destroyed us.

I’m old enough to remember life before “fast” social media, and the difference is staggering. I’ve grown more depressed over time because I remember what it felt like to have a *community*. After work, my friends and I would grab drinks, coffee, or just hang out. On weekends, we looked forward to going to the mall or trying a new restaurant. We’d plan trips to Comic-Con and coordinate our cosplays. We were *intentional* about spending time together.

When we sat across from each other, we rarely checked our phones. This was back when Instagram existed but didn’t yet have Reels or an endless feed. We’d already seen what we needed to see for the day, and we *knew* that nothing felt better than real life. It was the perfect balance — a little social media, a lot of living.

Fast forward to now, and it feels like everyone has vanished. Trying to make new friends is nearly impossible. People prefer to stay in their own little worlds — whether they’re married, single, or raising kids — focused on their private hobbies. Homes have turned into personal playgrounds: a theater room, a hobby room, a reading room. It sounds nice, but it’s isolating. In return, people now have high social anxiety, poor communication skills, and inflated egos. Everyone thinks they’re the main character, and this detachment gets labeled as “peaceful,” “empowering,” or “independent.”

They don’t realize the damage they’re doing — to themselves *and* to society. We need each other, yet everyone is apart all the time.

Trying to get a group together now feels like trying to convince an addict to go to rehab. You know it’ll be good for them, but they’ve lost faith in what “good” even feels like. They might give it a try for a day, but comfort and isolation feel easier — even if they’re slowly killing us.

I can’t believe I used to live like a character from *Friends*, surrounded by people and laughter. Now, all I have is my phone, showing me curated versions of other people’s lives — people who seem to be “living,” but it’s all for content. Nobody wants to *actually* live anymore; they just like the *idea* of it. Anxiety has replaced spontaneity, and people would rather watch others live than experience it themselves.

I wish there was something I could do to change that — to create **third spaces**, real places where people can gather without their phones. Not temporary events, but lasting spaces that nurture community. I know there are still people out there who understand how important that is. I’d love to build something like that, but I have no idea where to start — and I’m broke, so it feels impossible.

Still, I know I’m not alone. So many people are silently crying out for connection but don’t know what to do. And honestly, it feels like those in power don’t want to fix it. No one’s addressing this epidemic of loneliness. My peers are like zombies, and whoever’s running this show seems perfectly fine keeping it that way.

I know that most of us KNOW this already. But what do you think we could do? Do we have any power in changing this?",2,1762804010.0,GenZ,1,1.0,False

1otnubk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/comments/1otnubk/uworld_61_average_to_a_26x/,Uworld 61% average to a 26x,"Hey guys!

I’ve gotten a ton out of this community, so I figured it was only fair to give back. I’m just an average student but I managed to navigate Step 2 with decent scores, and I hope my journey and tips can help someone else too.

My exams:

* NBME 9 – 251 (June 15)
* NBME 10 – 244 (July 05)
* NBME 11 – 250 (July 14)
* NBME 12 – 245 (August 02)
* NBME 13 – 244 (August 19)
* UWSA 3 – 237 (August 30)
* UWSA 1 – 246 (September 02)
* NBME 14 – 255 (September 05)
* Free 120 2021 – 83% (September 27)
* UWSA 2 – 264 (October 02)
* NBME 15 – 261 (October 07)
* Free 120 2023 – 86% (October 11)
* Actual (26x)

CMS forms:
* 3 months before exam → mid-late 70s average
* 20 days before exam → mid 80s average

My Journey:

I started UWorld for Step 2 back in late January, going really slowly at first. I finished my first pass in early June with a 61% average (yes I just vibed thru med school and only realised studying was a thing near the end). My first NBME after that was a 251, which in retrospect was a total fluke haha.

Then I did CMS forms, averaging mid-to-late 70s, and took NBME 10. My score dropped, which was super demotivating. Breaking down my incorrects made me realize I had a knowledge gap (remember, if you can’t decide between two options, it usually means there’s a concept you haven’t fully mastered.)

I decided on starting Amboss. I went through it subject-wise, making one liner ddx notes alongside- if i was getting qs wrong in my second pass, that was obviously a concept I was having trouble with. These notes rly helped me in the end. 

I was doing 120-140 qs a day, subject-wise (helps to see how two similar presentations differ). I started with weakeer subjects based on uworld stats + exam weightage, but eventually ended up doing ~75% of amboss in 20-25 days.

I took NBME 12 and got a score dropped again (not my fault 12 sucks anyways). I was exhausted so I took a break, gave OET, relaxed a bit, did a few more amboss Qs and did a few blocks of my uworld incorrects. I was also having trouble with thinking ‘NBME-style’; having done amboss so recently made me overthink every single q which led to low scores in NBME 13 too. 

Post nbme 14, I realised I ought to have gone through my uworld incorrects earlier. I did them 100 at a time (rmmbr I had 61% average so there was plenty haha).

I then did a few more CMS forms (was getting mid 80s in these), realised I was bad at surgery and obs, reset uworld and did like 20% of uworld in 5 days with an 87% average. This cram session helped a lot since OB and surgery feel all over the place. 

 After incorrects + cram session, my last 4 scores were all 260s so I decided to go ahead with the exam.

I tried doing fischer’s ethics qs which helped a bit in my exam, and went through my notes the day before my exam which RLY helped me personally bc they had all the concepts I was weak in. 


Tips:

* When in doubt do more Qs. 
* If you find yourself confused bw two options in nbmes, it’s prolly a knowledge gap- you prolly don’t know the key info which ddx bw those two options. 
* also some of us have a habit of reading rly fast and skipping words subconsciously, I know I do. So in qs in which I wasn’t able to ddx bw two options, I would reread the q, but actually vocalising the words, I’d be able to find I missed a key bit of info quite a few times.
* You know how in every NBME there’s that one topic you “knew” but got confused on? Note those down. Make a list of such topics so you can revise them the day before your exam.
* Everyone studies differently but for me my typed out notes were immensely helpful.
    * I did AMBOSS subject-wise, and made my notes subject-wise, focusing not on the whole topic but on what I got wrong.
    * I focused on the key finding or phrase which would help ddx it from other similar presentations, and generally stuff I got confused in. 
* My notes ended up pretty long haha, 40K words or so, but I revised these in 8 hours the day before my exam and that proved to be rly helpful bc I didn’t have “shit I knew this but forgot” moments.
* Do the AMBOSS HY, especially the AMBOSS Ethics part. very, very important!
* I did not do anki because I’m a lazy ass but all my friends who did scored rly well, so if you’re disciplined give it a try. 




Exam Tips:
* Don’t panic. The real exam thesedays is proper weird, u just need to keep ur cool. Some of my friends got 3 ethic/QI qs per block, I got around 10. Remember you’ve gotten decent scores all around, trust ur preparation. 
* Whenever you’re confused, remember to always take a step back remind urself they're not tricking u and go with the first option that comes to mind, or the most common.  
* The other thing is time management. The Q stems have gotten longer, with loads of HOPI questions. My personal strategy was to try to get the first pass of all 40 qs done in 40 minutes. Any Q I was the tiniest bit confused in, I chose the most likely option (in case I didn’t have time to come back), marked it and moved on. Sometimes, I’d even just mark longer questions simply to complete my first pass in time.
* Another thing, don't change ur answer on your marked questions just bc u feel like it, only if you're making an informed decision. Remember you've been studying for so long your scores have been good, trust your gut instinct.
* Take spongy earbuds, sometimes their noise cancellation headphones suck. The dude next to me was having trouble with his computer and apparently wasn’t aware whispering was a thing so yeah, take ur own earbuds.
* Take natural tears for your eyes, absolute lifesaver. 
* Take a hoodie, and wear long socks. Most centres are pretty chilly, you can always take stuff off you can’t wear anything extra. 
* For food, the week or two before the exam, I replicated exam breaks, and would take a sip of coffee only once every hour, and would take chicken strips or nuggets etc as a meal around 12/1 PM. In the exam, I took black coffee with no sugar and nuggets and also dark chocolates. Once you start eating the chocos u want to take one every break so u don’t have a sugar crash. 
* I took a break after every block just to go to the washroom, freshen up and come back, maybe a few pushups if I was feeling groggy. 
* I didn’t brush my hair so I looked a mess in the ID pic- seeing my tragic pic before each block actually helped me relax, not rly a tip but it worked lol

Just remember, you’ve been preparing for this exam for sooo long, you’ll do great. Believe in yourself! 

I’d also like to help people with step 2 (I’ll be honest, I haven’t taught step before so I’ll be learning to do that with you, but I’d like to work on my teaching skills so if you’re willing to be my guinea pig hmu!)

They’ve done blood tests and STD tests, etc., but everything comes back well within normal ranges.

**Medications/Substances:**

* Wellbutrin 300 mg
* Vyvanse 40 mg
* Prozac 10 mg
* Risperdal 1 mg (twice a day)
* I use marijuana daily, and I drink a beer or two every day after work. I haven’t changed medications or anything in forever — this has been my routine for probably the last five years.

At the beginning of the year, I got sick (I assume it was COVID). Once I recovered, I started feeling *hot* all the time — seriously, for about four months I would literally be pouring sweat just sitting on the couch drinking a cold beer in shorts and a T-shirt. I’d have to go sit outside in the freezing cold to feel better, and even then it didn’t always help.

It kind of comes in waves, but the past couple of months it seemed to go away — until a couple of weeks ago. I started getting hot flashes again. They usually last around 10 minutes or so, and my entire body gets sweaty. I feel fine otherwise, just uncomfortably hot and sweaty.

Over the past couple of months, I’ve also been getting random bouts of nausea that come on quickly and go away just as fast. I haven’t actually thrown up, but I’ve had that runny-drool feeling a few times right before you’d expect to.

The past few weeks have been worse — nausea, headaches, kidney pain, neck aches, shoulder aches, and hot flashes. The flashes aren’t as frequent as before, but a few days ago I literally couldn’t sleep because I kept cycling between being so hot I’d throw off my sheet, and then so cold I’d pull my comforter back on. It went on all night and into the next day or two.

Today I woke up in kind of a fog. I had a slight hot flash while getting ready for work. When I got to work, I was still foggy. I drank my coffee, and then came a wave of nausea — it passed, but as soon as it did, I got a headache that still hasn’t gone away.

Some other background: even when I’m not having hot flashes, I feel warmer than I ever have before. For 15 years in my office I am in now I’d keep the AC vent in my office closed all summer and wear a hoodie because I was always cold. This past summer, I left the vent open (it blows right on me) and ran a Vornado fan as well. My skin, hands, and face would get so cold from the fan that they’d start to go numb, but I *still* felt hot. I’ve since switched to an indirect fan, and it helps, especially now that it’s getting cooler outside.

The only time I’ve actually *felt* cold lately is when I was trying to sleep and keep going through cycles of sweating hot to freezing cold. As I’m typing this, the indirect fan is cooling me enough that my hands feel cold — but I still *feel* warm, if that makes sense. 

These symptoms all come on fast and go away just as fast. I’ve been to the doctor a couple of times, but they just say, “I don’t know — everything looks healthy,” and send me on my way. There’s never a long-term pattern other than it coming out of nowhere and disappearing just as quickly.

It’s just getting really old because I *never* used to get headaches — ever — and now I’m taking ibuprofen almost daily for them, and I was ALWAYS cold before unless it was above like 75.

I just don't know where to start because no doctors around here will take me seriously, they do the usual blood tests, urine tests, and send me on my way with a clean bill of health.

If he gets bored, he will start nipping at you or all the things you hold dear. In the first 6 months, my arms and hands looked like I was getting into daily fights with about 50 cats. Ever since then, his main priority has been destroying random things in my house. 

He is now about 13 months old, and my couch has been obliterated at every corner, my coffee table looks like beavers had sawn off each edge, and I've had to replace doggy beds once every few months due to him destroying each one. Every toy I buy him ends up in pieces within a couple of hours, despite how ""durable"" it's branded. 

I've tried many different tricks over the year. Redirection only works for a few moments, and being stern only makes him feel like a challenge to play more or play harder. 

There's more to it, but the long and short of it is this:

1. What kinds of toys or objects can I get him that will keep him busy but will also hold up longer?

2. What strategies can I get him to do to stop chewing on my furniture and my belongings? It's getting expensive to replace.

3. As someone who works 40 hours a week and lives alone, what further strategies can I do to keep him busy and worn out? I already walk him every day, play fetch with him outside or take him to doggy day care 2x per week.

You know the one—the desk is cluttered, the sunlight is fading, and the endless line of digital rectangles starts swimming together. My old, cheap plastic water bottle felt like another piece of trash waiting to be tossed. I needed a vibe shift, not more coffee.
Then I found this.
It wasn't just a mug; it was dramatic. The color is this deep, translucent ruby, like a glass of something forbidden and delicious. The texture, though, is what got me. It has these heavy, tiered arches running up and down the sides—it feels like holding a tiny piece of deco architecture in your hand.
Now, my routine is different. Every day around two, I make my ""elixir""—usually just sparkling water and a few frozen berries. As I pour it into this substantial, handled mug, the light catches the textured arches and refracts that deep red everywhere. It’s heavy, comfortable, and the handle is perfect for swinging it around when I pace during calls.
It’s completely absurd that an ordinary drinking vessel can change your mood, but it genuinely feels like an upgrade. It’s too beautiful to leave empty, which, bonus, means I’m actually hydrating. It's less a functional object and more a silent, ruby-colored trophy for surviving the workday. It just sits there on my desk, catching the light, daring me to feel boring.
I love a good find that doubles as a piece of functional home decor. Definitely a game-changer for the desk aesthetic.",1,1762803349.0,Indian_flex,1,0.67,False

Within the past 3 weeks I have noticed my supply dipping little by little everyday. I was a just enough before, making between 8-10 ounces (in 3-4 pumps) during my 8 hour work day, and I would pump an additional 3-4 at night after my baby nursed, this was just enough to send her 4 bottles of milk to daycare each day. Within the past couple weeks I have noticed this has dipped to 50%-75% of what it was originally. I am now only pumping about 5 ounces total during the work day and maybe 1-2 ounces at night. I have been having to supplement with milk from the freezer, and I don't have much to use before I have to start using formula. 

I haven't really changed anything, I power pump every morning at work, I either do the 20-10-10 or a 30-rest 30-30 power pump. I have done this, almost everyday, since I returned to work 3 months ago. I drink minimum 90 ounces of water everyday (plus extra at meals, coffees, a few body armors everyday). I eat oatmeal with brewers yeast in it, focus on high protein everyday. None of this has changed. My daughter got hand foot and mouth last week and she was cluster feeding for a few days, and was waking up every two hours at night for several days, after that she went back to her routine of getting one 4-6 hour stretch, and every 2-3 hours outside of that. I nurse exclusively at home, and will use a manual pump after feedings from time to time.   
If anything the extra feedings and cluster feedings my daughter had last week should have increased my supply not dropped it right? I though maybe it was my pump, so I replaced the duckbills and diaphragm's, but the supply dip seems to be with my manual pump as well. My daughter still seems to be content with feedings, maybe a little extra hungry at night when my supply is lowest, but nothing new for her. Am I just not responding to pumps well anymore? What am I to do? I still have to work and cant afford to buy new pumps to test the theory. I feel liek Im already power pumping and hydrating a lot, what else can I do?

# 🌟 Why Mug Printing Is a Smart Business Idea

If you want a business that’s low-cost, creative, and scalable — mug printing checks every box.

**Here’s why it works:**

* **High demand:** Personalized mugs never go out of style.
* **Low startup cost:** You can get started for *under $1,000.*
* **Great profit margins:** Blank mugs cost about $1–$2, and you can sell custom ones for $10–$15 or more.
* **No big space needed:** Just a desk or small table at home is enough.

Whether you want to make funny quote mugs, wedding gifts, or branded merch, you can easily turn your creativity into profit.

# 💡 Mug Printing Ideas That Sell

Niche ideas = focused marketing + loyal customers. Try these:

* **Personalized photo mugs** – names, milestones, and memories.
* **Funny quote or meme mugs** – humor always sells.
* **Corporate mugs** – logo mugs for branding and giveaways.
* **Event mugs** – weddings, graduations, or family reunions.
* **Hobby mugs** – pet lovers, teachers, gamers, coffee addicts.
* **Seasonal designs** – Christmas, Valentine’s Day, or Mother’s Day themes.

Start with one style and expand as you gain confidence.

# 🧰 What You Need to Start a Mug Printing Business at Home

Here’s your simple setup list (and yes, it fits in a spare corner of your home):

1. **Sublimation Printer** – Like the *Sawgrass SG500* for high-quality, full-color prints.
2. **Sublimation Blank Mugs** – Make sure they’re *poly-coated* for the best transfer results.
3. **Mug Heat Press** – Applies the perfect heat and pressure.
4. **Sublimation Paper & Ink** – For crisp, fade-resistant designs.
5. **Extras:** Heat-resistant tape, gloves, ruler, parchment paper, and design software (Canva or Photoshop).

# 🪄 Step-by-Step: How to Start a Mug Sublimation Business

1. **Choose Your Niche & Brand Name** – What kind of mugs do you want to sell?
2. **Set Up Your Workspace** – Keep it organized and well-ventilated.
3. **Design Your Artwork** – Use Canva, Photoshop, or Illustrator. *Always mirror your image before printing.*
4. **Print the Design** – Use sublimation ink and paper.
5. **Tape & Press** – Secure your design, then heat press it onto the mug.
6. **Cool & Peel** – Let it cool before removing the paper.
7. **List Your Mugs Online** – Take clear photos and write SEO-friendly titles/descriptions.

# 🛍️ Where to Sell Custom Mugs Online

Here’s where most mug sellers find success:

* 🛒 **Etsy** – Perfect for personalized and handmade designs.

Start small, then grow as your customer base expands.

# ⚠️ Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)

🚫 **Using non-sublimation mugs** → ✅ Only use *sublimation-ready blanks.*

🚫 **Skipping test runs** → ✅ Experiment with temperature and time first.

💡 **Pro Tips:**

* Keep notes on your best settings for consistency.

About $500–$1,000 including printer, press, and supplies.

Papa John’s International Inc. is once again at the center of the private equity world’s radar. Reports indicate that TriArtisan Capital Advisors is leading a consortium in advanced talks to acquire the pizza chain in an all-cash deal valued at approximately $2.7 billion. The proposed offer, around $65 per share, represents a near 58 percent premium to Papa John’s most recent closing price of $41.20, signaling growing investor hunger for established yet undervalued consumer brands.

**The Price of a Slice: Valuation and Market Snapshot**

At a market capitalization of roughly $1.36 billion, Papa John’s has long been viewed as a brand with strong fundamentals but sluggish market performance. The $65-per-share bid reflects more than just optimism—it marks a bet on the enduring power of pizza as a delivery-driven, franchised business. For TriArtisan, the valuation premium is not merely about buying a brand but about acquiring a scalable platform with operational reach across the U.S. and beyond.

The buyout, if completed, would nearly double the company’s valuation overnight. That kind of premium doesn’t happen often in the current economic climate, making this deal one of the most closely watched transactions in the restaurant industry this year.

**Why TriArtisan Wants Papa John’s**

TriArtisan Capital Advisors is no stranger to the restaurant world. Its portfolio already includes TGI Fridays, and it recently agreed to take Denny’s private in a deal valued at roughly $620 million, debt included. The group’s strategy is clear: build a network of established, cash-generating restaurant brands that can leverage shared logistics, franchising power, and supply-chain efficiency. Papa John’s—with its robust delivery infrastructure and loyal customer base—fits neatly into that vision.

Insiders say TriArtisan believes the pizza chain is significantly undervalued. While same-store sales have fluctuated in recent years, the company still holds one of the most recognized names in the global quick-service restaurant market. With a strong franchise footprint and tech-driven delivery system, the chain offers what private equity craves most—cash flow, brand recognition, and a platform ripe for optimization.

**A Slice of a Bigger Trend**

Private equity has been on a buying spree in the restaurant sector. The logic is simple: restaurants with established brands and loyal customer bases can be optimized privately, away from the short-term pressures of public markets. Investors can streamline operations, renegotiate supply contracts, and experiment with pricing and marketing strategies without quarterly earnings scrutiny.

TriArtisan’s move mirrors a broader industry shift. Cash-heavy funds are targeting companies that combine stability with underappreciated potential. In uncertain markets, where tech valuations can swing wildly and consumer spending habits fluctuate, pizza chains like Papa John’s offer something refreshingly solid—a steady appetite for comfort food.

**The Deal’s Uncertainties**

Despite the optimism surrounding the offer, the deal isn’t sealed. Negotiations are still ongoing, and no agreement has been signed. Sources caution that talks could collapse, as previous suitors, including Apollo Global Management, reportedly withdrew a $64-per-share offer earlier this year citing concerns about sector softness and consumer spending pressures.

The restaurant sector is under strain. Inflation has pushed up ingredient and labor costs while consumers grow more price-conscious. Even large, established chains are wrestling with thinner margins and shifting dining habits. That reality makes TriArtisan’s aggressive valuation notable—it’s a bet that operational efficiencies and private ownership can restore profitability faster than public markets expect.

**What’s at Stake for Shareholders**

For Papa John’s shareholders, the potential $65-per-share offer represents a substantial windfall. The premium alone could entice many investors to cash out if the deal goes through. But for long-term holders, the buyout might feel bittersweet—taking the company private means losing exposure to any future upside that TriArtisan might unlock.

If completed, the deal would delist Papa John’s from public markets, handing strategic control to private equity owners. TriArtisan and its partners would likely implement an overhaul focused on cost discipline, menu innovation, and expanded digital engagement. The playbook will look familiar: streamline, modernize, and prepare for eventual re-entry to the market under more favorable conditions.

**A Symbol of the Times**

This potential transaction underscores how private equity continues to dominate post-pandemic corporate dealmaking. With public markets volatile and growth stocks under pressure, investors are turning to the predictability of everyday businesses—especially those with tangible assets and proven demand. Pizza, it turns out, remains as investable as ever.

The restaurant space is consolidating, and private equity is leading the charge. From coffee to casual dining, and now pizza, the industry is seeing a flurry of buyouts. These moves are less about novelty and more about discipline—PE firms believe they can do what public markets can’t: extract efficiency, rebuild margins, and refocus brands for sustainable growth.

**What Comes Next**

TriArtisan’s pursuit of Papa John’s may inspire similar moves across the food-service sector. Competitors like Domino’s and Yum! Brands will be watching closely. Even if this particular deal falls through, it signals a strong resurgence of M&A activity among restaurant operators—a reminder that in an era of digital transformation and economic uncertainty, private equity sees value in what people will always crave: convenience and comfort food.

For now, investors wait. The offer remains on the table, and the pizza giant’s fate hinges on whether both sides can agree on terms that satisfy shareholders and management alike. Whether Papa John’s stays public or joins the growing list of private equity-owned dining giants, one thing is clear: private equity’s appetite for America’s most dependable brands is far from full.

**Conclusion**

TriArtisan’s $2.7 billion bid for Papa John’s is more than a headline-grabbing takeover—it’s a reflection of where capital is flowing in 2025. As investors pivot away from riskier tech bets and toward reliable consumer brands, the restaurant industry has become a hotbed of strategic activity. Papa John’s represents the perfect storm of brand equity, scalability, and potential—qualities private equity thrives on. Whether the deal closes or not, the message is unmistakable: private equity is hungry, and the menu now includes some of America’s most beloved franchises.",1,1762802449.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False
1otn588,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1otn588/do_i_give_him_a_second_chance/,Do I give him a second chance?,"I (F22) met ‘Johnny’ (M19) at a nightclub a few weeks ago. He’s younger than what I’d have liked, but the chemistry was instantly  there and I thought he was interesting. 
We when to the bar and he bought me a drink, and confessed he was a virgin so not to expect anything (I wasn’t anyway). He said however we could go back to my place and watch a movie, which we did. 

For context, I’m not a lover girl. But I didn’t want him to leave, even hungover the next morning. He didn’t until he absolutely had to. The next day we went on an official date and I’ve never ever had such a good date. We were both exceptionally happy, and not to be crude but he wasn’t a virgin anymore following that. 

The same week he wanted me to meet his family, who liked me. I know that’s fast but his brother got engaged within 6 months of knowing his fiance so I figured they were just happy and excitable people. They invited me on family holidays ect. He went on to meet my friends and we made it all official on social media. He told me he loved me after our first date. I said it back. It’s crazy but I’m crazy about him. I’ve had a horrible year and it finally felt like the universe was making it up to me.  

Then, a week later, it all changed. 

I planned a proper date for us. He arrived at my place not seeming himself. He informed me he won’t be able to stay the night as his friend (who is very troubled) needs him. I was upset as I pre paid for the date activities, and told him this. I understood his friend put him in a hard place but he should have told me. After that, he got really weird. Saying he can’t see me after he’s seen this friend because he gets nasty. And he hurts his family. Not physically, but he gets angry. And he said he’ll hurt me too, followed by a chilling look. 

I panicked and ran upstairs. I came back down and said he cannot speak to me in that way. That he cannot scare me like that. He eventually calms down and we proceed with the date. 

In the date, he confessed to me he didn’t want me to stay over the night previously because I was on my period. I’m shocked at this, and tell him that’s openly sexist. He storms out. I follow. We talk for a bit then he walks away again and ditches me in the middle of town to find my own way home. I go out with my friends instead. 

I wake up the next morning to find a breakup text, saying that he’s not in a good place but I’m a beautiful woman who did nothing wrong. We agree to go for a coffee and he looks awful. Like a ghoul. He found out his childhood dog is dying (that dog means the world to him) and that breaking up with me is like throwing away a jewel. He’s unemployed (only for a week or so) and is sorting applications to nursing school. I however study biochemistry and advanced maths, work full time as a carer for young disabled people, alongside a whole bunch of other stuff I won’t get into. I also got a contextual offer for a very prestigious university this year. He said all he does is wait for me to finish working or studying, and he’ll never improve himself if I’m around as a ‘distraction’. That he can’t love me until he loves himself first. That he cannot match my level because not only am I very pretty, I’m also talented and clever and he can’t be that for me. 

I said there’s no way that’s it, and he agrees. I said he’d be back within a week. He said yeah, that he still loves me,  then had to leave due to family commitments. We said we might give it another go. He also leaves to go to Spain for a bit to care for his nan after her surgery. 

We are supposed to meet on Friday. We agreed to be friends, and help each other with uni applications ect (I still need to submit other applications, long story). I am truly crazy about this guy and I hadn’t felt this way in years, if ever. I am so certain he’s my one, and he’s just going through a hard time. 

My friends tell me to ditch him and I understand why. But I also think fighting for the person you love is what’s right, especially when they’re having a hard time. ",1,1762802425.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

Aged an Imperial Stout in a Henry McKenna bourbon barrel for 2.5 years. Pulled 400 shots (200 doubles) at my friend's cafe, Lekko in Cleveland OH. Machine was a Rancilio RS1. Grinder was a La Marzocco Swan. Beans were house-roasted, Brazilian natural. Took about 2.5 hrs to pull the shots and we immediately poured them into an iced keg of the beer to cool the espresso as quickly as possible. The keg was also purged with Co2 to prevent oxidation to the beer and coffee. 

Named it ""Grind Finer"". Beer came out great. It's about a 1/2oz of espresso per 12 oz pour. Definitely a different coffee character compared to the other coffee beers I've made that have either steeped beans or used cold press. Richer and oily - more espresso like as you'd expect. I don't like how a lot of coffee beers age, but this has continued to round out and sweeten up over the last week since it's been kegged.  And unless you come to Noble Beast in Cleveland within the next few weeks, no, you can't get any of this.

so bob is going to university and rob isn't . bob and rob have joint custody with their bio mum so 2 weeks there and 2 weeks here but since bob is writing final matric exams he decided to stay at his mums house and i guess that made jones a little stressed 

  
so since bob has been better at everything then rob , rob never got much attention growing up so now that rob is busy ,bob is getting more attention  

  
so jones is rlly stressed abt the electricity bill (we'll get to it just now)

  
so all the kids are writing exams and i have a big music exam that is like 50/ of my grade and jones is good at music so i asked for help and he said he has to work, fair right?? NOOOO i kid u not 2 seconds later rob askes to play chess....CHESSS not exam help CHESSSS nd jones says yes immedietly

I usually have to go a few times right before the race begins 

This last race I had a black coffee and PH 1500 (electrolyte mix with 750mg sodium) 2 hours before and nothing else to drink beforehand until the race started. 

 I thought taking a high concentration sodium drink before would decrease the urge to urinate before but it didn’t. 

For my next one I’m just planning to have more time prior to the race when I have liquids but does anyone have advice on this ?

1otmvst,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1otmvst/some_general_home_improvement_tips/,Some general home improvement tips,"Home improvement is a hobby of mine. I want my home to feel like a home. I believe it should be the place where you have everything you need for it to feel comfortable. If you are someone like me who enjoys company, I believe it is also important that your home is hospitable. I am not very fond of being invited to a friend's home and their home has barely any necessities or doesn't feel very inviting to guest. Especially, when they want or expect guests to come over. If I invite someone over I want my place to feel welcoming to them and I want them to feel comfortable while they are there. It's very important for me, and it definitely pays off. I have gotten so many compliments on how I arrange my home and the things I have available for people when they come over. It's great having everything you and others might need. There is no better feeling in the home when come face to face with a problem and you have just what you need to take care of said problem. So, here are some general tips and things that make a home feel more comfortable.

1. Learn about Feng shui. It's an ancient Chinese practice that has to do with arranging furniture and other things in a room to create a sense of balance and harmony within living spaces. It does discuss things like chi and spiritual stuff which some may not believe in, but I can say the principles of it really do work in making a home feel more balanced and harmonious. 
2. Get some basic tools for simple repairs around the house. Things like a hammer, screwdrivers, pliers (regular and needle nose), an adjustable wrench, a tape measure, a level, Allen wrenches, a stud finder, a box cutter/utility knife, a drill, and some drill bits. These are all nice to have even if you aren't the ones who use them. Maybe you know someone who is more inclined with that stuff and it makes things easier for them to help you if you already have things like that available.
3. Put small trash cans in reasonable and sensible places around the house. This helps so much with keeping everything clean and makes picking up much easier. It's especially helpful if you have ADHD and get distracted very easily. I got the idea from school classrooms as I remember most classrooms I have been in had trash cans in different areas around the room. Also, if you are someone who work out and buys protein powder you can cut the tops of the empty containers and repurpose them as small trash cans. Good way to save time and money instead of buying them yourself.
4. Save plastic containers, jars, and small sized boxes to help keep small things organized. This can come handy for things like paperclips, twist ties, pens and pencils, nails, screws, really anything small that you want to keep together. Dollar Tree is a great place to buy small containers and baskets, among other things.
5. Get some paracord and zip ties. They really come in handy. You can use a bit paracord for things like tying them to handle of a pots and pans and hang them up to save on cupboard space. Zip ties can help with things like keeping cables and cords together, wrapped, and organized. We use hand sanitizer a lot in my house, and I didn't like how everyone would always move the bottles or they would just be in the way. So, I came up with idea of making a simple contraption using zip ties for sanitizer bottles to set in and hung them on the wall.
6. Find some way to hang up brooms and mops to keep them organized. In my home we use ceiling hooks for this, because there is a ceiling beam right in the place, we keep all that stuff. Also, get one a hand broom they also come in handy. If ceiling hooks aren't feasible for you, and you have a broom closet with a rod in it then you can use paracord and maybe a hook with eyelet to hang them on the rod. Just figure out what will work for you.
7. Have a first aid kit. You can buy one or you can buy the stuff separately, but it's good to have things like band aids and things to help clean infections. 
8. Get some playing cards and some dice, and a couple board games if you like playing them. Never underestimate the power that playing cards, dice, and even board games have in bringing people together. They can make for a fun night with company. 
9. If you save some lids from plastic containers like coffee containers, dry creamer, or even protein containers you can repurpose them to be used as spoon/utensil rest for when you or someone else cooks. 
10. Have some hospitality when guests come over. Offer them something to drink when they come in the door. Tell them where the bathroom, trash, and recycling are, and be sure to tell them what things are available for their use, so they actually use them, such as the small trash cans if you were to have them. People won't know to use those things if you don't tell them, and some people may not ask. 

So, there you have it. There are 10 tips for making your home better. I could come with more I am sure, but I will stop there. Just do whatever is feasible for you. If you like those tips remember you don't have to get everything all at once. It can take some time before you have everything. Rome wasn't built in a day. Just be adaptive and consider what is you need to do once you come up with new ideas to improve your home. If you have some ideas of your own that I haven't mentioned I would love to hear about them!

It unfurls a new leaf every now and then, does not brown up and dry at the tips, basically it was thriving. Every now and then I would add coffee grounds/dregs left over from boiling coffee in order to prevent the browning and drying of the tips which is a common issue of this type of plant. And it worked for two years. I would water it very rarely, when it told me to (cuckoo as it may be i can just feel when she’s thirsty because i love her so much!). I kept her away from direct sunlight but in a bright room. EVERYTHING WAS WELL! Then she started yellowing and browning aggressively all of a sudden. The damage you see happened in less than a week’s time. 
I have 2 theories of why:
1. Last time I gave it coffee grounds I may have put too much? (The way I do it - I scoop some mushy grounds up with the teaspoon when it’s cooled down and  paste-y and I put it on top of the soil. Then when I water it next the coffee would go down with the water - I only did it at mosttt once a month, mostly every other month).
2. It loves the humidifier - I do something called tropical time - I gather my humidity loving plants whenever I remember (which is not very often) and let them sit around the humidifier. Few days before the yellowing started I left said plants around the humidifier sth like 20 hours, more than I had ever done before. Could it be this?

Please help me figure it out! The roots are fine just a little overgrown, I wouldn’t change the pot until the following spring - unless I conclude the coffee is the problem in which case I’ll have to quickly change the soil…

Basically, the point of the meeting was to “get to know each other,” since our areas work together from time to time. In that specific meeting, her area did a presentation for ours about what they do.

During that meeting, there was a point where it was her turn to present what she does. Now, an important point is that I’m the type of person who, while someone is presenting to a group, purposely takes the role of an “anchor”, by nodding, making eye contact, etc.
Since I know how affirming it is to have someone clearly paying attention while you’re talking to a group, and since I’m actually listening, I’m usually the one who asks the most questions, because, well, I want to understand their point.

While she was talking, I was doing my part, and at one point she stopped looking at everyone else and started clearly looking into my eyes, basically presenting just to me to the point that it almost turned into a conversation, in a room with like 10 people.

Now, I know that this whole interaction probably happened because during that meeting I became her “anchor,” and by turning it into almost a conversation, she became more comfortable presenting her point. I also know that anyone could have ended up in my position.

With all that taken into consideration, I still want to at least ask her to get some coffee together the question is how to do that.
At work, it’s almost impossible to talk to her, since she’s always with someone, the office is really small, and people love to gossip.

But there’s another way: we’re both in a work group where I can get her number and send a message. I just don’t want to sound like a creep.

1otmqek,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1otmqek,Just moved in and need some help decorating my living room :),"
This is my first, and hopefully my forever home. I’ve never furnished anything larger than a 10x10 ft. room before, so I’m honestly not sure where everything would look best or what my aesthetic would be called… but I’m excited to start with the living room!

So far, I have a cement dining table, a fake bamboo planter, and acrylic magazine rack that I picked up from fb marketplace. 

I compiled some living room furniture I’ve been looking at, and I’m curious to see what combinations you think would look nice and where they might go (e.g. A1 for sofa/coffee table combo). 

I have no rugs, lamps, or other decor in mind yet. Honestly, I appreciate any and all insight you have to give regarding these, from color/shape ideas to links.

Thanks so much for your time :)

I’m fairly certain there are no insects in my home or on the plant but all the new leaves are growing in gnarled and half torn off, even the new sprouts. The old leaves are fine. All I do is water it every other day. I read I should give it some coffee grounds but I don’t drink coffee. Is there anything else I can do? This is my first plant so any help is appreciated!

She is a really nice girl, but I had a strong feeling she is not really available as much as I am. We have some really lovely dates, but I never really hear from her when we are not together. She says things like ""I am 100% in this relationship"" and then takes sometimes 3-4 days to get back to a simple message. She pops up for a few hours and then vanishes for the rest of the day, yet still is active on social media. 

Anyway, she suggested coming to her house and maybe meeting her parents, which I thought was the right step towards hopefully getting more of an idea of where we are going. Before that though, she said she wanted to see me more over half term (as we are both teachers) which I thought was brilliant, but she seemed to be too busy for it apart from a date to the zoo followed by an aerial class (as that's her hobby)

I hinted I could give it a go, but due to an arm injury I will find it tricky, but she reassured me I would be fine.

Day came of the zoo and aerial class and we had a nice time at the zoo. She was flirting with me and I was flirting back. I was trying to impress her with my knowledge of the zoo's history and just trying to enjoy our time together. After the zoo trip we had 4 hours to wait before the Aerial class.

She started saying how I would ""need to hang upside down on a bar and support my full body weight"" which I honestly told her I would not be able to. I said I will still come and give it a go, but may have to sit out if I risked arm injury. She seemed understanding of that and we went to get a coffee.

On the way to the coffee she said ""So are you my boyfriend now?"" and I said ""I would like to see you more and meet your parents first, Just as I feel like I do not see you enough"" Which she said ""Thats 100% okay, Thats why I wanted to ask first"" and we then enjoyed the rest of our day. I know I messed up a bit, but I really did not want to rush into something after 5 dates.

We got to the class and Sarah's friend Jess was running it. Jess seemed to do the normal things a teacher would do for a class and ask for our names and any disabilities or any injuries. I saw that the aerial pole was way over 7ft in the air and had to say sorry and say that I could not due to injuries. I sat out and cheered Sarah and helped her get up when she needed to. Jess did not talk to me pretty much all evening and ignored me. As soon as the class was over Jess walked out with Sarah after I said goodbye and I am pretty sure they talked about me.

Once I got home I asked if she was home safe and asked about Jess and she did not answer me. Since then 9 days later, I have had 0 messages.

I guess I messed up with everything, but dam 9 days of ghosting afterwards just feels extreme.",19,1762801326.0,AskMenAdvice,88,0.69,False

Days, evenings and nights. I've worked at this location for 8 years and have been primarily days which is 7am-330pm. Sometimes you get moved between shifts to accommodate manpower but are only mandatory to do 30 days before you can switch back to your preferred shift. I did an 8 month stint on evenings which was 4pm-midnight and I honestly loved it but was forced back to days. 

Currently Im toying with the idea of switching to nights or 'backshift' which is roughly Midnight-730am. You get a 30% bonus on your pay which is huge and obviously your commute to and from work is much less traffic. I'd do evenings again but than I'd basically never see my GF given she works the standard mon-fri day shift. 

Just looking for tips on how to be successful working this type of shift. Looking for things like...

- What time would you sleep until to ensure you werent tired throughout the night?

- Best ways to ensure I can get good rest at home during the day? 

- Dieting. Do you even bring food? Do you drink coffee etc? ",1,1762801250.0,work,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) The Milwaukee Bucks and Dallas Mavericks are set to clash in a game that’s already been written off as a snoozefest by the betting market. With Dallas sporting the league’s worst offensive rating (106.5 PPG) and hitting the UNDER in 8 of their last 10 games, this feels like a matchup where the crowd will need a second cup of coffee just to stay awake. The Bucks, meanwhile, are dealing with their own defensive woes, having allowed a 118.2 net rating this season.

**The Verdict:**  
The UNDER 229.5 total (-112) is the way to go. Dallas’ anemic offense (29th in offensive rating) and Milwaukee’s porous defense (24th in defensive rating) suggest this game will be as exciting as a tax audit. Even if Luka Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo try to spice things up, the Mav

Preface: I hadn’t slept in weeks and I’m going through a lot, I hadn’t been to this target store and I had just driven 2.5 hours when I arrived. 

I had to pick up things to help me sleep and I also was looking for gifts for my little cousins and I had a return. 

I always take a reusable bag with me because it’s easier and I don’t pay for bags. This is why lp said he followed me.

I picked up coffee, sleepy tea, magnesium, candle, contact solution total he said was around 60 dollars.  

I went to kids clothing and my basket was getting heavy for my arm so I took my bag out with the items I wanted to get and the clothing in my hand. I went in the line but it was long so I went to guest services to get the items there and I wanted to check for a different size in the clothing and do my return no one was there and I was waiting then I remembered I didn’t have my clothing return it was in my car not in my bag (I had other clothing in there from elsewhere too).

I actually even forgot this when I was stopped it all happened so quickly I put down the clothing at guest services and I went to get my return when I was at the door this woman bumped into my chest a couple times and I had no idea what was happening and that’s when two other people came and they took me to the side and I realized I had the bag and was walking out. Maybe you don’t believe me when I say it was not intentional but an honest mistake I was going to get my return and even before I’m sure on my way I would have realized I have this stuff in my bag let me go back then go get the return. 

I was trying to explain to them it was an honest mistake but of course they wouldn’t believe me and kept screaming at me to go into the room I tried to speak with the store manager but they wouldn’t let me. 

They took my ID, photo and made me sign a no trespass order. They said I wasn’t in the system but also I don’t know what they were doing they said something is pending which I’m not sure what. I didn’t want to give my ID I wanted to speak with the store manager because it was an honest mistake but then one lady was like okay let’s call the cops so I gave my ID then. They kept saying you could have been out of here already and the man told me I just can’t go back to that target for a year and could go anywhere else. They didn’t tell me anything would happen after but the whole thing has made me sick. 

I tried to call the store several times but no one answers! I wanted to know what is happening now was this it or will I receive citations or civil in mail. I keep reading all this stuff online and don’t understand why they call the police for some but not for others? 

I have smoked two packs of cigarettes I don’t know what to do. I’m scared to ever walk into a Target again. I also don’t like being in their system as a thief when it was an honest accident. Please respond to me guys I appreciate it. ",0,1762801053.0,legaladvice,3,0.33,False

Every year around this time, there’s a wave of posts that sound something like this:

“I’m extremely confident my grades will be good.”  
“I don’t want to apply early and lose my ‘greatest asset.’”

That thinking is completely understandable—but it’s also how a lot of people quietly miss out on early opportunities. It happens every year, from the T100 to T14 to HYS.   
  
If you take one thing away from this post, it’s this: **do not bank on grades you don’t have yet.**  
  
Recruiting moves earlier every year (you guys know this, it's like 90% of what is discussed on this sub), and by the time your transcript posts, the firms you want might already be interviewing or filling spots.

# Why “Waiting for Grades” Is a Risky Bet

A few reasons I think are worth considering if you're still in the ""I'm going to wait"" bucket.

1. **You don’t actually have the grades yet.** Confidence is good, but certainty is better. Until your grades are released, they’re just an assumption. A lot can shift after finals. (I promise you, everyone thinks their grades will be great. I did--and they ended up remarkably meh. If they do, phenomenal, but if they don't, you not only are now applying with crummy grades, but applying LATE with crummy grades. I promise you law school grading is not like undergrad. I would not bank on anything.)
2. **Recruiting is already underway.** Many firms—Latham, Kirkland, Sidley, Paul Weiss, and others—open applications months before first-semester grades are available. You can see a ton of movement already taking place on the database. Recruiters are reviewing resumes, holding coffee chats, and scheduling early screeners and callbacks literally right now.
3. **Early visibility matters.** Getting your application in early increases your odds of being seen at all the events firms will host through the semester (meaning you have more time to build networks and get them to advocate for you). Recruiters and hiring partners remember names they’ve already come across.
4. **Time is the one thing you can’t replace.** By the time you’re waiting for grades, other candidates will have screeners scheduled or callbacks pending. The longer you delay, the more ground you lose. **And remember, even if you get rejected early now, it doesn't matter, because you can reapply once you get grades in anyways. Applying now gives you two bites at the apple, instead of one.** 

# But What If I'm KJD--I Can't Complete

I understand this fear, but I promise you, you're not the only KJD out there. Plenty of other KJD's get these jobs every single year. Do not give yourself any less of an opportunity to apply and get interviewed. If they want to reject you, fine--they'll do it. But for all you know they may want to interview you now anyways. You have no way of knowing unless you apply early.

# What You Can Actually Control Right Now

Instead of waiting for your transcript, focus on what you can polish immediately.

* Your resume, cover letter, and writing sample
* Your list of firms, practices, and offices of interest
* Your networking outreach

If those pieces are ready, you are ready. Grades will come later—and when they do, you can always send updated transcripts or mention them in follow-ups.

# Timing: Apply Early, Update Later

You do not need to wait for perfect grades to start applying.  
  
Firms know that 1L and 2L grades are released later. What matters more right now is that you show interest and initiative. I promise you, they are super aware (and equally unhappy about it)

Apply early. Keep networking.  
  
When grades come out, update your application or follow up with recruiters.  
  
It is far easier to revise an existing application than to start from scratch once the cycle is already in full swing.

# Common Pushbacks (and Why They Don’t Hold Up)

**“What if my grades are bad?”**  
If they are, yes, it sucks, but you can roll with those punches later. But if you wait and they aren’t what you expected, you will have lost the chance to be in the first wave of applications.

**“Will firms reject me for not having grades yet?”**  
Very unlikely. Firms expect that 1Ls and 2Ls won’t have complete transcripts right away. What they want to see is preparation and genuine interest. An early rejection now possibly speaks to something else that grades likely might not make up for anyways. 

**“I don’t want to waste my one shot.”**  
There is no single shot. ***Applying early does not prevent you from applying again or sending updates later. Waiting does.***

# Firms move early, and, as we have seen in the past on the database, early momentum can beat late perfection.

Even if you are confident that your grades will be strong, **timing is the one asset you can actually use right now.** Grades open doors, but initiative keeps them from closing before you arrive.

I’m dealing with a combination of issues and would love input from anyone who’s been through something similar.

Coffee/alcohol make things worse. Gallbladder surgery is planned, and I’m trying to understand how much of the reflux/bloating picture might improve afterward vs needing a separate reflux strategy.

If you’ve had gallstones + LPR-like symptoms + histamine sensitivity:

* Did your reflux or throat symptoms improve after cholecystectomy?
* Which foods stayed reliably safe long-term?
* Any evidence-based supplements or routines that made a real difference?

1otmdc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1otmdc9/5_day_fast_because_someone_made_me_mad/,5 day fast because someone made me mad,"\*backstory\* I know this is the wrong reason for doing this..  
Yesterday I got hardheaded and stubborn and refused to eat anything unless I bought it or provided for myself because someone made me feel disrespected. Basically first, I didn't buy coffee because the store was out of my normal brand. So this person kind of made me feel like a piece of shit for that. I was already spiraling into something but I kept a hold on it, but after that coffee incident I really spiraled and just couldn't stop. Now, the night before I had bought them food (they wasn't here when I bought it, but I figured they would came around later) Saw that I had bought something from somewhere else for myself and asked me what I got them from that store, (after they ate the food I had bought for them mind you, without even telling me thank you) I told them nothing because I had already bought them food from somewhere else and I just wanted a hotdog. They made me feel like a piece of shit because I actually just spent my last $20 on their food and they wasn't appreciative of it. Even though I didn't have to get them anything. So because of their words/actions, I decided that I'm pretty much done with them and refuse anything they offer me. This started on the 8th, but that's also the night I ate the hotdog (free reward from a gas station mind you so I didn't even have to pay for it) so I cant count that. Yesterday, they bought some stuff and put it right next to me, as if i was going to eat it. It sat there all day without me touching it.  Later that night (around 8pm) they bought dinner and asked what I wanted and I told them nothing. I am not hungry. (At this point though, its already been 24 hours and I'm actually very hungry and beginning to get light headed from it) They bought their food and tried handing me something which I gave back to them and said I don't want it! Since I wont get paid for another 5 days, I decided that I'm going on a fast. Ill only drink water. Because I don't need any ones pity or sympathy.

I am the definition of CUT YOUR NOSE OFF TO SPITE YOUR FACE. You know, that saying our parents always said ""Never cut your nose off to spite your face."" Well that's me, I'm that one that will cut my entire face off just to spite my head if I feel disrespected. Which in this case I do feel highly disrespected. I honestly don't care if I'm being a hard headed jackass for this. I was disrespected and made to feel like a piece of shit because I didn't get them something from store 2 after spending the rest of my money on their food to begin with. So now its day 2 of my 5 day fast and they tried giving me lunch, I told them I'm not hungry even though my stomach is growling so loud I think the neighbors hear it. I'm very light headed but I'm also bullheaded, stubborn jack ass and will NOT eat anything this person brings or gives. Ill die before I let this person win after disrespecting me like they did. Ive always been like this though, hardheaded, bullheaded, dumbass, jackass, doing shit just because. I know I have a mental problem and need help with it, but that's a problem for another day. I have looked it up, I have been thinking of trying a intermittent fast, this just pushed me to do a extreme fast and I figure ill be fine. I have enough body fat to fast for several weeks/few months if I need to.

Just for more background; I cared a lot for this person, I actually love them with all my existence, hence why I spent my last bit to make sure they had food. They have made it very clear and apparent that they do not care about me the same way though. That's the other part that pushed me into doing this. They tell me that they love me, but their actions and words prove otherwise. Realizing that this person only cared about what I give them or what they could take from me without me caring. Because they know I'd give everything for them. The entire thing yesterday really made me think about it and for years i always did/got something for them without as much as a thank you. Valentines I got them something, got nothing in return, not even a thank you. Mothers Day I gave them everything I had because they wanted to go somewhere on that day. Not even a thank you. Fathers day nothing at all. Not a happy fathers day, nothing. My birthday I didn't even get a happy birthday. So I thought about all these times where I would go out of my way for them, and they would never reciprocate. I know none of that stuff should matter, but if you care about someone you should at least, the bare minimum, tell them Happy Birthday. So not only will I fast, but after reading this long post back to myself to check for mistakes, I realize i am going to cut this person out of my life. They are someone that I should have never let in to begin with. That just makes me feel really sad.

Realizing that someone you spent half of your life around, was only there when it was convenient for them, really hurts inside you know? Sorry.  /rant",0,1762800740.0,Rants,0,0.5,False

Her daughter’s dad was a nightmare from the beginning and my ex was afraid to set healthy boundaries. He looked up my house address online and drove by my house looking for her one day. He confronted her about information regarding me that he could only get through a background check (nothing nefarious. Just old businesses I used to be a co-owner in). He took their daughter in the middle of the night on a ‘nighttime adventure’ where they drove past my ex’s house and my house to see where she was. The daughter ratted on dad to the mom. The dad said he was just getting medicine for himself. At midnight. A week later her and I were at a coffee shop and were walking to our cars when she saw him pull up. She hid and asked me to hide with her. I then saw him go into the coffee and depart within 60 seconds with nothing in hand. My ex dismissed all of this and said he wasn’t dangerous. I made police reports each time to document the behavior, but didn’t tell her. She begged me not to as she said it would blow up her life. He actively tried to ruin the relationship and constantly begged for her back. Eventually, we split because of him. Now, I retell all of these instances, and many more to my therapist as part of my trauma therapy. She eventually tells me that she has a legal obligation to report the instances I told her about to child protect services due to what she described as a toxic and emotionally dangerous situation for the child. My ex was notified of the report by my therapist and immediately texted me some awful things about how I’m ruining her daughter’s life and that she’s coming over my therapist’s license. She doesn’t know who my therapist is and it will be kept confidential. She also said ‘f you and f your therapist.’ Am I the asshole?

1otmbt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/grok/comments/1otmbt2/my_tips_for_using_grok_video_generation_sfw/,My Tips for Using Grok Video Generation (SFW Content),"For my own personal amusement, I’ve been creating longer-duration videos. Here are a few tips I’ve learned over the past month of experimenting with Grok.

**You’ll Need a Video Editor**

My workflow involves grabbing screenshots and stitching multiple short clips into a longer video. I currently use HitFilm for this, but it’s abandonware. If starting fresh I’d use DaVinci Resolve.

**Create Reference Characters and Environments**

For every video, I generate reference images of characters against a neutral background. I have Grok create the base image, save it, then generate variations (e.g., different clothing) and save those as secondary references.

This gives me consistent characters to feed back into Grok, maintaining continuity throughout the story.

I do the same for scene locations - a starship bridge, living room, bedroom, etc. - so the setting stays uniform.

**Let Grok Break Physics**

When resetting a scene or making a dramatic change, Grok often struggles to preserve physics. I prompt something like: “An invisible magic portal appears and instantly places the character next to the sofa. The character stands relaxed.”

Simply asking the character to move there can produce odd results, especially within the 6-second limit. The portal gives Grok permission to cheat. It doesn’t always work perfectly, but it helps a lot. The same trick aids in removing, adding, or changing clothes (though current Grok avoids NSFW).

The standing relaxed is important as often characters will freak out if magical portals and sending them around the universe.

**It’s Easier to Add Clothing Than Remove It**

If a character will appear in various states of dress, start with a topless reference image. Then, in image-to-video mode, layer clothing on top - Grok handles this flawlessly.

For genitals, take the topless reference and run it through WAN 2.2 in ComfyUI to generate a nude version.

Create your undress variants in reverse order (more nude -> topless -> clothed -> clothed with coat). That way, scenes can progress from fully clothed downward without hiccups.

**Scenes Longer Than 6 Seconds**

Download a 6-second clip, extract its final frame, upload that frame, and continue the action. Repeat indefinitely to build any length. Stitch the segments in your editor.

In practice, details degrade as objects move out of view. A watch visible in clip 1 may vanish in clip 2 if it’s hidden in the uploaded frame.

Keep characters facing the camera during extended takes. If someone turns away and back, facial consistency breaks. Start a new scene with fresh references instead.

You often will have different pacing in the clips, sometimes you need to just reroll hoping you get consistent. You also have the option to speed up one of the clips in your video editor. I wouldn't recommend slowing down as that will not look as good.

I typically achieve 18–30 seconds of coherent flow - long enough to feel natural, given typical editing pacing. 

**Grok Excels at Compositing**

Start in Paint dot net (or similar): layer a reference background (e.g., living room) with roughly cut-out characters. Upload the composite to Grok and prompt: “An invisible portal opens and instantly teleports them into the living room. They are properly sized, lighting matches, and paste halos are removed. All stand relaxed.”

Extract the best post-teleport frame from the 6-second clip. Feed it back to Grok as the new baseline, then prompt the desired action.

**Avoid Negative Prompts**

Don’t say “no” or “don’t.” Instead of “he has no hair,” say “he is bald.” Negatives invite the unwanted element, e.g., “Do not show an elephant in the living room” almost guarantees one.

Rephrase to describe only what you want, omitting references to what you don’t.

**Sometimes You Can’t Fight the Training Data**

Certain requests clash with ingrained biases. Yesterday, a user wanted a fictional character without thumbs; no prompt or edit could remove them - they kept never disappeared or grew back if manually removed.

A classic example: a wine glass filled to the brim. Training data overwhelmingly shows partially filled glasses, so brim-full is nearly impossible.

Living rooms default to sofa + two end tables + coffee table. I can sometimes omit items, but they often reappear mid-scene.

If results stay stuck, consider how real photos are shot. Deviate too far, and you may need to rethink the scene entirely.

**Don’t Over-Describe Background Elements**

A detailed background character will steal focus. The model interprets heavy description as importance and centers it. Keep extras minimal.

**Grok Favors Beauty and Balance**

It prefers balanced compositions - think family photos with parents flanking a child, or groups at equal depth. Professional photography norms make odd framing hard to force.

It resists characters entering/exiting or partial framing. Hiding someone behind furniture or letting them walk off-screen takes retries and often fails.

**Grok’s Audio Is Unreliable**

I ignore Grok’s sound entirely and dub everything in post. Prompt dialogue for mouth movement, but plan to replace the track.

**Other quick tips:** make sure to output consistently with the upscale video, Grok will use the aspect ratio of the image fed to it (portrait, landscape, square, etc), portrait will give the best character details, use grok to set the scene for you and then feed it into WAN 2.2 Comfyui if you want actual spicy.

I have washed the trays with hot soapy water and allowed them to dry 5 times and have wiped them down with rubbing alcohol but they still smell like coffee.

# What are the Creation Club items included in the Anniversary Edition?

The Anniversary Edition comes with over 150 pieces of Creation Club content, including some previously unreleased items. The following 9 Creation Club items are making their debut with the Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition and Creations bundle:

**Institute Plasma Weapons (new)**

In ramshackle apartments, lonely diners, and beggar's bowls, the operatives of the Institute conduct their trade. Included in their dealings are several high-grade plasma weapons, experimental guns to be tested in the field. Altogether, Institute Plasma Weapons features three unique weapon types and special legendary versions!

**Ion Gun (new)**

Developed by Poseidon Energy and passed on to unlisted clientele, the Ion Gun harvests concentrated plasma and channels it into a beam of pure incineration. Barbecue your foes to a laser-fried crisp with this experimental hand cannon.

**Bunker Home Pack (new)**

Whether it's a modest private bunker, the contemporary stylings of the Juniper Cove Resort, the classical architecture in the Wilmingdon Estates, or the technological marvels of the Vault-Tec Showcase, there's a home for every Wastelander in this one-of-a-kind pack.

**Cyber Dog (new)**

Half dog, half machine, part bark and all byte, the Cyberdog is the ultimate in good boy technology. Ever versatile, this loyal companion can be programmed to respond to over a hundred different names.

**Sea Scavengers (new)**

Across the trenches of the Glowing Sea, shadows tread silently through the Wasteland. Follow their tracks through waves of irradiated desert, and learn the story of those caught in their clutches. Comes with a fully customizable outfit with multiple variants, and a brand new 12.7mm Sub-Machine Gun!

**Brahmin Armor (new)**

Adopt your own beefy two-headed sentinel to help guard your settlement and boost its defenses! Choose from over a hundred unique names to give your bovine bruiser a personalized touch.

**Railroad’s Clandestine Couture (new)**

Not every friend is someone you know. Play the role of a secret agent and help deliver a package to the Railroad, or side with the Institute and eliminate the agents working against. Just remember, when trying to distinguish friend from foe, pay attention to the signs. Includes five new Railroad themed outfits.

**Repurposed Power Armor Helmets (new)**

Discarded by the wastes, these erstwhile Power Armor helmets have found a new home in the piecemeal workshops of Tribal mechanics. Altered to function as standard helmets, these helmets provide heavy duty protection without the need for bulky Power Armor frames.

1otm85p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1otm85p/humanize_chatgpt_for_essays_without_getting/,Humanize ChatGPT for Essays without getting flagged by AI detectors,"So I’ve been struggling with this all semester and I swear it’s the most annoying academic battle of 2025. I *like* using ChatGPT to get my ideas straight, but every time I submit something that even *touches* AI, Turnitin or Winston or some random “AI Probability Check” extension my professor uses just starts screaming at me like I committed academic war crimes.

The weird part is the content isn’t wrong. It’s just… too “ChatGPT tone.” You know what I mean:

* Perfect grammar (which I do **not** possess)
* Sentences that sound like they were written by a well-rested adult
* No personality
* Everything is just… *smooth.*

Meanwhile, I’m a student who writes essays half-asleep with 3 iced coffees and emotional damage. The vibe is NOT the same.  
Last week I had a psych reflection essay due. I used ChatGPT to outline, rewrote a bit, turned it in. My professor literally wrote, *“This seems overly formal and lacks personal voice.”* Like bro… I WROTE ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA??? What more voice do you want 😭

So I went down a rabbit hole of “how to humanize ChatGPT” tutorials. Most were just “add typos” (no), “use slang” (absolutely not for APA), or “change random words” (makes everything worse).

This video was actually helpful though because it explains why AI text gets flagged instead of just saying “use synonyms”:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltqHxgJcuDQ&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltqHxgJcuDQ&t=1s)It breaks down the structure of AI writing and how to tweak tone without destroying meaning.

**Also not gonna lie, the thing that actually saved me:**  
I started running the text through **Grubby AI** afterward. It doesn’t rewrite like a thesaurus, it makes the text sound like… a student who’s trying their best and maybe slightly tired.  
It added little imperfections and tone shifts that didn’t look fake.  
 My last paper came back with **2% AI score**, which is basically “human with coffee jitters.”

Not trying to be promotional, just saying:  
If you’re in the same situation where you're like “I’M NOT EVEN TRYING TO CHEAT I JUST DON’T WANT TO FAIL,” that combo actually worked:

1. Generate structure/points in ChatGPT
2. Watch that video to understand *how to reshape tone*
3. Run final draft through Grubby AI to humanize it

Now it reads like *me.* A person who is tired. And stressed. And real.

If anyone else has tricks for adding “personal voice” without sounding chaotic, drop them please because this semester is trying to kill me 🥲

I’m struggling at the moment, I have an overactive thyroid and Graves’ disease that’s majorly flaring up and has made me quite it, I’ve recently been signed off work because of if and my mental health has taken a serious hit. I’ve started on anti anxiety meds and been given diazepam to try and help me relax and sleep since I’m also suffering with insomnia. My doctor has told me to avoid stress at all costs. So because of all this I’m not sure if I’m overthinking or if my gut is right and that I should leave my partner. 
For a bit of back story I have been with my partner for 6 years, we had a brief split 3 years ago due to his controlling behaviour that we talked about and I became stronger as a person and have stood up for myself if he ever starts again. It’s hard to pinpoint when things started going wrong. He’s not a social person, but he’s been staying less and less at my house and going out to the pub more, I tend to leave him be when he’s out because I’m not the clingy type that needs lots of texts and phone calls. But he used to spend every weekend with me and now it’s rare for him to stay at mine on the weekend. I don’t know if this bothers me but I find the behaviour change odd. 
He’s recently said about going on a long weekend away to Amsterdam with a work mate and was almost annoyed that I was ok with him going. I mean, it’s his life, his money, if he wants to go away with a mate then I don’t see the problem with it. 
There’s been a couple of these kind of odd moments that individually aren’t an issue but they are starting to add up. 
Now to this weekend. Saturday started off fine, my little boy (8) had a football match that we went to, then popped into town to do a couple of jobs, my partner wanted food and he picked a place I wasn’t a fan of but I couldn’t think of anywhere else to go so I agreed. I’m struggling to eat at the moment as there’s a lot of foods on my restricted list and my new meds are causing me to be nauseous. 
My partner paid for our lunch and complained about how much it was , I paid for my little boys (he’s not his bio dad) because I felt nauseous I could only eat half my food. This seemed to really annoy my partner, so I transferred the money to cover my food since it was wasted. But things just kept going wrong. 
He wouldn’t hold my hand on the drive home, was driving (my car) very aggressively, and wasn’t responding when I tried to talk to him. 
When we got back to mine he continued the silent treatment and stayed outside, not uncommon as he often does bits in the garden. I started to make him a coffee and when I went outside his car was gone. I tried calling but no answer, I text him which he said he needed space. 
The next day he messaged about shopping because I can’t drive for the first few days on meds. Then text to see about coming round that night but I honestly didn’t want to see him so I told him I wasn’t feeling well, not untrue but not the full truth. The thing is, it’s not normal for him to text and ask, he usually calls. 
I feel really detached right now. I’m going through enough as it is and I don’t need him having a strop. But he has a habit of being like this and then pretending like nothing happened. 
I don’t know if it would be an overreaction to leave him or if the relationship has run its course. Help me please",227,1762800296.0,AmIOverreacting,147,0.93,False
1otm5om,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedVitaminsGB/comments/1otm5om/the_hidden_cost_of_ultraprocessed_foods_energy/,"The Hidden Cost of Ultra-Processed Foods -  Energy, Mood, and Gut Health","
Over the last few years, I’ve noticed something repeating again and again, both in my own health journey and in the clients I work with.
People come to me saying:

“I eat very healthy… but I feel tired, my stomach is bloated, i have a mental fog.”
When I start to look closer at their diets, I realise that 8 times out of 10, the hidden factor of the reason is the ultra-processed food.

What Are “Ultra-Processed” Foods, Really?

It’s not just fast food or obvious junk food.
Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are those that come out of a factory line - made with ingredients you wouldn’t have in your kitchen: refined seed oils, emulsifiers, artificial sweeteners, additives, preservatives, synthetic flavours.

They can hide behind “healthy” labels too:

- “Plant-based” protein bars
- “Low-fat” yogurts
- “Keto” snacks
- “High-protein” cereals

From my experience, these products often cause more inflammation than nutrition. They fill your stomach, but starve your cells.

What I’ve Observed in Clients

When people rely on UPFs (even the “clean-label” kind), I see three main things show up consistently:

Sluggish digestion
Clients complain about bloating, irregular bowel movements, or that heavy feeling after meals. Once we swap out the packaged meals for real food — digestion literally “wakes up.”

Energy dips and crashes
Many people believe it’s a caffeine defficit, but it’s not. Processed foods are causing major blood-sugar spikes and plenty ofinflammation, which drains the mitochondrial energy production.
Once we get rid of these ultra processed foods, the energy curve stabilises, we will notice less crashes, improved focus and the mood becomes better.

Nutrient gaps
Most ultra-processed foods gives you calories without too much nutritional value, vitamins, minerals, and cofactors which are used in your mitochondrian process .
I’ve seen blood work majorly improving once clients reintroduce whole foods and quality supplements, their bodies finally starts absorbing properly again.

From My Own Experience

I went through this too.
Years ago, I used to think I was eating well: protein bars, diet drinks, “healthy” convenience foods.
But I was running on low energy, with brain fog that no coffee could fix.

When I started removing these hidden UPFs and replaced them with real, unprocessed meals, things shifted.
My focus returned. My sleep deepened. Even my skin looked clearer.
That’s when I realised: the body can’t heal in an artificial environment.

What Helps (And What I Recommend)

Here are a few tips which worked for me and i would totally recommend:

Read labels and be very focused on the ingredients - if there are names you can’t pronounce, most likely are ultra-processed.

Replace, don’t restrict - one portion of greek yogurt(full fat) with some wallnuts and blueberries will always be healthier than a “protein bar , or if you want a low carb wrap, eggs and some organic veggies are a good option

Cook at home more often - you don’t have to be a chef or do fancy meals, just stick to simple real food ingredients , meat, eggs, veggies, etc

Support your system - try to supplement with quality supplements that replenish what ultra processed foods deplete . Use activated B vitamins, Magnesium, CoQ10.

Hydration is important - mineral water and electrolytes support the digestive system while helping the removal of  inflammatory residues.


Final Thoughts

I have noticed that many people tend to ignore the real cause of their low energy, poor focus, and slow recovery, that being ultra-processed foods.
These are not affecting only your waistline, but your cells, gut, and even your mood.

Try to reduce them and your body will feel lighter, your energy will be more stable while your supplements finally start to do their job.

If you’re preocupied about improving your health, first step would be to chef what it’s on your plate.
Your mitochondrian “engines” will be more than gratefull for it.

Great explanation about why Brians turnaround plan might not be the best for the future of Starbucks! Closing the pick up only wasn’t the best of ideas. While trying to uplift the 3rd place is still a good idea, it is important also embrace the delivery/mobile options. We are a omni-channel company. Customers might choose to do drive thru one day, another mobile & another the lobby.  I have always felt like Brians focus is a bit old fashioned with trying to do a high-class coffee experience. That should be reserved for our fancier Starbucks reserve stores (which he also closed in Seattle area!!!). ",2,1762800271.0,starbucksbaristas,1,0.63,False

I have MCAS but it is more GI and heart focused... However, My cousin has struggled with allergens and Asthma her whole life and when I saw her this weekend, I began to wonder if her symptoms could be MCAS when she mentioned *sometimes* being allergic to seafood and other foods and *sometimes* not- as well as having heart palpitations and AFIB when she is having GI symptoms (constipation etc) and that following a low histamine diet and cutting out stuff like coffee has helped with all her symptoms. To be clear though, she mostly struggles with asthma or asthma-like symptoms when she comes in contact with an allergen though, something that does NOT happen to me.


Does anyone have mostly respiratory symptoms? If so, how/why does it manifest and what does it feel like for you??

1otm4da,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/1otm4da/ccc_transfer_ucb_haas/,CCC Transfer UCB Haas,"I’m 28 and decided to go back to school wanting just an AA in finance or accounting from my local CC to be a better employee. I work at a manufacturing facility (bottler/distribution for a large beverage company) full time, started in warehouse procurement and shuffled around up to accounts payable. I’ve held every retail position imaginable from Store Manager, to procurement. I was persuaded by my 18 year old self to try Cal again. Big joke? Maybe. It has worked in encouraging me to give it all I got. I consider myself a high school burn out. I took only APs since my sophomore year of high school, was hit hard with senioritis and divorcing parents and ended high school with a unweighted 3.4, stayed home with my mom to help pick herself up, and never got the roll of things in CC. Dropped and failed a lot of classes, started working 2 jobs to compensate for the over spending and told myself college isn’t for me. 6 years later, I found an interest in accounting, and supply chain management, and all the aspects of manufacturing. I’m finally comfortable enough to go back to school and I paced myself to know I can’t do more than 10 units a semester and work full time.I’ve done 3 semesters so far - 24 units and I haven’t had a grade lower than a B. That’s all it took apparently for 18 year old me to say “We can try again.”

I’ve retaken the classes I’ve failed before and I’m still 28 ish units from being able to transfers, but the truth is, I can’t take extra curriculars. I work during most of them, and the idea of starting my own “Accounting Club” or whatever scares me. I help my mom and her friends with their books once a year and that’s it. Even if I stretch it out as “Helped low income single moms with taxes” I feel like it’s bullsit since we get coffee and pan dulce and frankly it doesn’t feel like a real extra curricular.

Also, honestly, I don want to take calculus again. My local state school is okay with the lowest “Business math” placement and I have it done. Cal would require me to take 2 more math class to fulfill the sequence to reach calculus 1. I know 2 more As or Bs (hopefully) would boost my GPA, but I’m just really scared I’ll lose steam. While it’s not a main requirement, it would make me more competitive to take calculus. I’m already proud of myself. I’ve gone from not wanting to go to school, to going back for an AA, to wanting to transfer to a state. My first goal was CSUEB for Accounting, but after giving it much thought, my main goal is SJSU for Bus Admin/MIS. So grade me fairly, as my GPA is 3.0 And maybe if you guys can recommend things that I can do to that will fulfill that “Extracurricular” would my job be enough?

Consegui emprestado com um amigo, e não sei se foi só comigo, mas eu não gostei dele. Achei que a moagem gerou muito mais fines que a do M3 Pro da iCoffee por exemplo, a peneira eu não achei tão útil, uma vez que pra ela funcionar direito vc tem que moer pouco café para ter espaço para que o café possa se movimentar livremente lá dentro pelo espaço ser pequeno. Em termos de uniformidade, achei a moagem um pouco mais uniforme, mas a troco de gerar muito mais fines, o que na minha opinião não é uma troca muito boa. Achei que os cafés ficaram muito mais ácidos e até puxando um pouco de amargor. Tentei mexer na moagem e continuei com a mesma percepção.

Im planning to buy a creta ev premium variant 42kwh . Costing me 20.5L on road. It has v2l, adas and all features except 360 cam. 

The thing im concerned about is NMC batteries and 8yr warranty from hyundai.

I planned other cars but didnt liked those. 
1. Windsor ev - I know this is vfm . Getting this for 18L pro variant. The big concern is screen controls for everything. Im a person who will change things and wouls be irritated in the long run. Also got reviews that suspension is stiff and users faced issues with charging stations.
2. Harrier ev - Really liked this one , but its 25 lakh, feareless variant. Also tata has bad reputation in terms of glitches and service. I myself own nexon since 5 years. Also concerned about rusting issies in the long run.
3. Kia carens clavis ev - Good but 7 seater , also v2p in 23L plus variant. Ill use ev in hills and tight spaces so parking will be a concern.
4. Be6 and be9 will be out of budget and also i dont like the design. 

Ill be using the ev for highway, city and hills. Wont  travel more than 250km in a single day, even on trips. If required, will use my nexon for backup and very very long trips and in areas where there are no chargers. Big space is not co cern for me since me , my wife and 1yr old kid will be travelling mostly. V2l is quite important for me since we'll use it for tea, coffee , baby food. 

Ill be keeping the vehicle for atleast 6 years. So looking for suggestions  , whether i should go ahead and get the creta ev. I might be wrong in some pointa above, so please feel free to correct  the assumptions. ",1,1762799951.0,CarsIndia,2,1.0,False

1otlwyt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1otlwyt,50% Coffee Grounds Bedding,"Sharing my experience.  

Bedding:  
- 50% Precomposted coffee grounds  
- 50% browns (drieds leaves, cardboard, cocohusk)  
- twigs and sticks 

Result:
- No observed death or anomalies amongst worms 
- Seen juvenile worms and large worms, population seems to be growing  

Process of preparing coffee grounds:
1. Composted coffee grounds with dried leaves for 30 days.  

Observations:
1. Freshly used coffee grounds are acidic, compact like sand, and have strong aroma.  It is very gritty, and holds water fairly.  
2. The coffee grounds heats up for at least 3 weeks after adding browns and moisture. I've seen some white fungi/mold growing. Can become anaerobic when holding too much moisture. I turned the mix 1-2 times a week, everytime the compost loses heat. Turning it too frequently may halt the hot compost.  
3. I find it loses some of the gritty texture after being composted. Need to add more grit like eggshells after.  
4.　Moist composted coffee grounds can be clumpy and dense, and would stick and clump around browns.  
5. If  mixed with more browns, resulting bedding is airy and fluffy and holds down a good balance of moisture. It is cool to touch and there are no warm pockets.  
6. I find the resulting castings too clumpy. I plan to be more generous with browns. 
7. The castings looks a lot like the coffee grounds bedding except its texture. I just use the bedding a bit longer so everything can all be consumed and converted to castings. 

Overall, 8/10. Castings are too clumpy to get a perfect score, must mix with generous amount of browns. Composted coffee grounds can be a bit too dense but provides soft texture, a good balance of moisture rentention, and an environment with cool stable temperature. It's low maintenance and the ultimate food bedding. 

Highly recommend.

Could I have handled it any differently?,"So the situation start off with me being attacked by my boyfriend's dog when I was 17 months pregnant. The dog had a history of violence and was a great Pyrenees mix(he was huge) we had to keep him completely isolated from other dogs and humans. He had attacked my boyfriend before to and this particular attack was the third time he got me and it was bad enough that I ended up without the use of my arms for months while I was recovering. He had only had the dog for about 4 years and during the time he got him he was with his ex who cheated on him with two of his friends she would bring them over to the house and sleep with them and do whatever else, flash forward to the attack I'm sitting in the hospital waiting to get stitched up and trying to stay as calm as I can do I don't stress the growing baby out in my belly and one of the first things he did was texted his ex about how we were going to have to put the dog down( I was unaware they even talked let alone about this situation). I didn't know until months later we had gotten his ashes finally. It was the weekend and I said so what were your plans today he said well I still just need to go to bimart and then make another stop I said oh you stoping by Steve's house(changing name but his lifelong friend who lives in same town we do) he said huh no it's just a stop I was like umm okay why are you being so weird what's going on? He said I'm stopping by my ex's grandparents house to drop of some of the dogs ashes I said um WHAT?!? 

  
He said yes I bought her a little urn and I'm dropping it off there and they will be giving it to her I said I don't understand why she's even involved with any of this let alone why you were messaging her worried about her feelings about a dog who's life she hasn't been in for over three years he said I didn't want you to be mad I was talking to her so I ""just neglected to tell you"" I told him how I felt about it and how I don't think she deserved any of the ashes but what's done is done I asked if I could go with him to make me feel better and he agreed so that was that

  
Flash forward I'm about a month away from our due date and he started getting text messages I asked who it was from and said(his buddies name) I peaked over literally just turned my head because we were sitting on the bed and I saw that it was his ex I said dude seriously just don't lie about it and keep me in the loop what's going on?

He told me he had gotten some mail of hers and messaged her letting her know she said oh it's just junk mail it's weird it was sent there because this has not been her address for years....(I read the messages he let me and that is what she said) I said weird because I check the mail everyday and haven't seen anything he said yeah I grabbed them because I didn't want it to upset you. I explained how that just added more distrust and I found it bizarre. I had given him his phone back and said so what were the last few messages about he said she had left her bike in the garage years ago and has asked for it back.....I said sooooo over three years later and your building a family with me she just now wants it back? 

He said I already told her she can have it it's whatever I said fine but I'm done with all this let me know when your returning it so I don't question anything and then I to put a stop to all of this I want everything she could have left behind gone...if there is something of sentimental value to you you can explain to me the meaning of it and what it means to you and we can come to a compromise about what to do with said object(store it away or put it up on a shelf somewhere) but to make myself feel better everything is going. He said okay If it'll make you feel better and we can be done with it I agree.

  
Baby girl has been born now and is six months old I've started cleaning up the house that has been neglected and had to be the one to throw everything away that I came across (old dresses, her kids toys, a cup that said thanks for all the orgasm yours truly(her name) just shit like that....then the other day I was washing his coffee cup I wash it every night and put it aside so he can grab it in the morning well I never cared to really look at it and it was engraved with a little love message from his ex.....I went into the bedroom and literally as calmly as I could said is that from your ex and he looked down and said yes and I'm sorry I know you asked for everything to go and I kept it it's just something I use everyday and wasn't thinking anything of it but I should have just thrown it away and replaced it. I said so you've been carrying around a love letter for over a year of our relationship like that thing goes to work with you it's with you all day. 

  
he told me I need to just let it go and to not start a fight over a cup but in my mind it's so much more than that. 

  
Would you be upset? Could I have possibly been better with my communication?

  
And yes again I have let it go but it still feels like things I ask for are just being completely disregarded and the number one thing he's said to me through everything is I'm sorry but I just don't see it that way ",1,1762799716.0,women,1,1.0,False

So far, it is lining up to be a low-stakes coffee date. However, this will still be unstructured.

Has anyone ever been in this situation before? What tips, tricks, or hacks have you used with some degree of success.

He was the most amazing guy I have ever met. I had never felt so safe, secure, full of trust. He was so gentle and kind and patient with me. 

Then the discard literally I felt like I was talking to a stranger. He was cold and dismissive. Said he wanted to remain friends on the phone and see how my life goes then 2 hours later unfollowed and removed me as a follower on some socials but stayed connected on one. I never in a million years thought he would do that to me. I sent him a message saying that was not necessary for him to do, that I do not want things to end badly and cannot handle that if they do. 

His response was “Not ending badly, just have to escape this cycle of hurt that we’re trapped in, and it starts by cutting me out. Really wishing you the best”

I never answered. It’s been 2 weeks. The first week I could not move. I couldn’t eat sleep or drink. I was crying everyday and shaking and depressed. The pain in my chest hurt so bad.

Also, I miss delicious baked goods. I miss being able to get that donut or that chocolate croissant with my coffee when out at a cafe. That was impossible with GDM and continues to be impossible now! So freaking annoying.

Anyone else tired of the same formula each franchise has used the past five years or so? Sorry for the rant below but enough is enough! 

*Throw a bunch of “accomplished”’women together. 

*Someone gets mildly offended and it is overblown the whole season. 

*Deep down, none of them are true friends. They turn on each other very quickly. 

*Many are overly eager to take another housewife down via social media, blogs or horrible rumors.  

*Ridiculous glam at all times. Even just waking up, full glam.  Nothing “real” about that.

*Nobody hangs out at each other’s houses like they used to back in the day. Most of the shows used to be filmed at everyone’s houses. Now, they have stupid little meet ups for coffee or some lame store for a few minutes. 

*Shows work much better when the cast are real friends and not strangers thrown together. 


I’ve slowly been weaning myself off these shows the last couple years and I FF many solo scenes. At this point, I know I just need to completely cut off watching them. I miss the original style of RH’s.

In late December 2024, I applied for the job role ""Barista Maestro"" (Shift Leader/Duty Manager) at an Equity Costa Coffee (owned and operated by Costa themselves). In early January, I had an interview and was told I was actually the only person who applied for the job (makes sense why now) anways I got the job. To add some context, I had no Barista experience at all, but I did have managerial experience. I was told that I was actually going to start working at the store I had my interview in for 'training' instead of the store I actually applied for. I was fine with this since the store I had my interview in was actually a lot closer than the store I applied for. I was also told that as well as this being because of training, it was also because this store (the one I had my interview in) was actually one of the busiest store in the area, so they basically wanted to throw me in the deep end, train me all up and then send me to the more quieter store (the one I originally applied for). Again, I was fine with this, however as I started working there, I wasn't actually given any training at all - now i'm not blaming the store specifically, as again it was a really busy store in a huge shopping centre so they basically never put me on the coffee machine - I was stuck on pots most of my time there. I kept asking the store manager when I was going to the original store but she said she had no idea. At the time, the store I originally applied for was essentually going down hill - their store manager had quit without notice, their staff kept calling in sick and the store ended up either being clsoed most days, or begging for cover from local stores. At the same time, the area managers were changing, as the current area manager was only seconded until the original area manager came back from maturnity (which was happening at the time). Everyone that I was working with kept warning me about the store that I was going to saying that they wish me luck and have actually been sent to work there and that it was horrible - this obviously was scaring me as I was really enjoying my time at this store that I was training at and really liked everyone there (even though I was stuck on pots 90% of my time there). I came in one day and the store manager said to me that she has been given a date that I will be going to the original store I applied for (at this ppint I had been at the training store for 6 weeks), she also said not to listen to everyone and that the store that I am going too will be fine, and that the Area manager (the original one now) wanted to speak to me as she was scared I was going to back out (considering I was the only one who applied for the job, and none of the baristas at the store wanted to step up to manager). Now that there was an actual date, on my last two shifts they tried to show me manager stuff such as the Log book, how to cash up etc... however, I learn by doing and all that was happening was them rushing ""showing"" me stuff - as ofcourse they wanted to go home at the end of the night too... I asked how do i lock the store and they said that they can't show me because their lock system was nwer as they had a recent referb and that I would be shown on my shift in the orignial store I applied for when I get there. However, when I checked my work scheduling app, I was scheduled for shifts where I was being the only manager on shift and locking up on my own - this had never happened at the training store and again I had been given bareley any training so was not confident at all. I raised this with the store manager of my training store and she said she will speak to the store manager who was covering the original store I applied for. 

  
So 6 weeks after i've been hired, I am now at my first day of the original store I applied for (which is in a small town), on my first day they changed it so I was closing with another Shift Leader so I could learn how they close and stuff at that store. We done it, I more or less understood it - it was fine. A week into this store now, I was on with two baristas and me as the manager. The two baristas were busy on the floor and on the machine (as I was slower and less confident), I was cleaning the cake disply ready for close down when a teenage girl joins the queue, I take her order she wanted a tea with oat milk. I got a takeaway up, prepared the tea - asked her when I should stop with the oat milk and put the lid on the side for her to put on (as I had gloves on and was on my way to serve the next person in the queue. 5 minutes later, the teenage girl goes up to one of the baristas (which I thought was odd) and I over hear the barista say ""okay, well \[my name\] is the manager at the moment, so you will have to speak to him."" Basically, when the girl picked up the takeaway cup, she din't put the lid on, and on her way to the table the water had gone on her hand and burnt her ever so slightly. She rang her mum, so said she was going to come to the store so the girl essntually warned us her mum was coming (unfortuantly, her mum used to work at the store). Now, at this moment, I had no idea what to do - luckily, one of the baristas who I was on with was first aid trained (it is not a requirement for costa staff to be first aid trained, they don;t train us on this - the barista had just had previous experiecne). I could only reccomend to keep a damp cloth on the burn, which we provided. I attempted 3 times to ring the cover store manager to ask what shall I do, as I hadn't been trained on a reporting process. I couldn't get hold of the store manager and I looked everwhere for an accident form in the office area and found nothing. A short while after, the girls mum came and I introduced myself and apologised and told her I was new, and I have alerted my manager of the insident and could only apologise. Thankfully, she said she understood it wan;t my fault and knows costa is an awful comapny for training (since she used to work there and left), however she said she was going to use her hold contacts to complain about the sittuation to the area manager. An hour later the store manager rang me and said she was so sorry and asked what was wrong, I told her what happened and she said it would be okay. 

  
I came into work two weeks later, with my fellow colleage who was also a manager saying that I needed to respond to an email from head office explaining what happened. This was kind of overwealming for me as I thought it had pasted or had been sorted out by the store manager since it had been a while - and at this point everyone was talking out it behind my back which made me feel awful. A couple of days later, the store manager sat me down and showed me the 'Takaway Cup Guide' and ran me through it, I told her I hadn't been shown this before and it was genuinely an honest mistake, I didn't know we HAD to put the lid on ourselfes, considering if you were to pick up a staying in latte glass, you could also have the same thing happen so it didn't really make sense to me. She agreed and said she had to telkl head office that in my defense, the takeaway guide doesn't actually say we MUST put the lid on ourselves. (Now, from what it seemed, it appread head office did want to punish me but the store manager had to basically admit that she didn;t know what I actually had been shown/trained and what I hadn;t - as it was clear my training store mnager didn;t communicate with the store manager at the store i applied for). 

  
This is where it gets intresting, STRAIGHT AFTER this conversation where the cover store manager had shown me the takeaway guide, I went onto the shop floor and went onto the Coffee Machine (The cover store manager really tried to push me onto the machine a lot since she knew I wasn;t confident and said as a manager I really did need to take charge of it as the Baristas, or at least most of them were new and didn't have coffee training.) A man came who was a regular who we all knew was quite rude. He would order 2 large lattes, extra hot, wet, whole milk, double cupped, foil on top and bagged. Which was quite an overwealming order when youre mid rush. I started to make the latte and left a 1cm gap from the rim of the cup to the drink (which is what the takeaway guide had said), he then asked if I could fill it to the top - now, considering I just got scollded by head office for not preparing the girls takeawy tea properly I just wanted to follow what they expected of me. I explained to him that I couldn't fill it to the top as it was just for the safety of our customers in accordance with comapny policy. This then caused him to start an uproar shouting at me saying I couldn't do my job properly. I was now really confused on what to do, he's telling me eveyryone fills it to the top, which I know they do - but I also don't want to now go againt what I have LITERALLY JUST been told. Thankfully, the cover store manager comes around the corner and I ask her what shall I do.. she says to me that I basically should not allow the customer to tell me how to do my job seeing as I know the comapny policy. So we have him an extra cup of milk on the side. This happened ending of february by the way (so 7 weeks after I'd been hired and 1 week at the original store I applied to. From the ending of february until the beginning of July (4 months) the same customer would come into the store, weather I was on shift or not and complain about me to whoever was on shift - talking about the same situation over and over again, constanly bad mouthing me to my colleages which made me feel so awful as a manager. There were two Costas in this town and he would go to the other one and do the exact same thing - bad mouth me there. He emailed and complained about me multiple times about this one time insident. Throughout those 4 months we had staff members from the other store help our store when needed and they would all tell me they knew about the insident (which just ruined my reputation).



We had a new permanent store manager start in March, and in June I reported the customer to head office for harassment as he said to one of the other mangers that if he ever saw me outside of work he would essentually fight me. I asked for him to be banned, I kept trying to coach my other team members that we need to leave this gap on takeaway cups as it was company policy but they were all scared and said they have never been told this so didn;t listen. We were all bored of him now, and I would always have to hide in the back when he came in as he gave me a lot of anxiety after not only the comment he made to my colleage but also seeing as he is still going on about it 4 months later. I refused to serve him once (which is within my right) when it was just me and a barista and I was told off for this as I was supposed to let the Barsia serve him - however, the barsia was not coffee trained (but he would also always ask for someone else to make his drink if I was already on coffee machine during a rush). In my repot to head office in June I asked for him to be barred. They made my store manager have a word with him to which he got aggressive and said he was disgusted they came and spoke to him, he then came in another day and agreed he wouldn;t come in if he saw I was in the store - he didn;t follow this and the harrassment continued.

  
In July, I repoeted him again, they said they asigned the insdient to an imparcial manager (howver, the manager investiagting was the same manager who was covering the store and saw the insident at the time, the one who went through the takeaway guide with me) although this din;t seem imparcial I was kind of happy thinking she could help as she knows eveything. I had a meeting with my Area manager where she basically said she had spoken to the relvent teams in HR and they have said they will not be banning the customer even after eveything he has said and done. The most they could do was keep it as an open ticket and continue to report anything. I had really lost faith in the company at this point, they had not trained me at all and allowed a customer to treat me this way (we even had a sign saying we will not tolerate abuse towards staff and you will be asked to leave). I didn;t even know how to turn the fire alarm off etc... I explained to the Area manager that I was really dissapointed with how this situation was handeled and would like to move stores outside of her area (thankfully, half an hour away the stores in another town were classed as a differnt regional area which was weird but good for me), she said she would ask and get back to me. Its importnat to mention, at the time when I was working in this store I was the only staff member of colour in a town which I didn;t know was extremly white and had a main consensus of tory and reform. I felt always picked on by the customers, I was recorded twice bacuse we couldn't accpet a customers voucher. I was told I had an ugly and vile face because a customers mobile banking wasnt working it goes on...

  
I had anual leave booked for mid july for two weeks and I noticed that my current store manager stopped asigning me shifts (she also stopped talking to me as me leaving caused stress for her as we was about to enter busy summer and at the same time I requested to move stores a full time barista had quit.) I asked my area manager if the stop of shifts was because that after my anual leave would i be starting the new store. She got back to me and said that yes, this was the case. After my two weeks, I started at my new store. Now, the store that I had come from earned a max of 1,500£ on a good day, my new store was a Drive Thru earning £4,000 on a good day. It was a very big change and I was basically just thrown in as 'youre a manager, you should know what to do, heres the keys'. I had never worked in a Drive Thru before, and I stuoidly thought I would have been given some training or support adjusting to the busy. On my first closing shift there, I was put on with a Barista who I knew was a little weaker than some I had worked with before. She seemed very calm, but I didn;t think anything of it as we all work differntly. Long story short, the next morning I woke up to multiple messages from the mangers chat with pictures of things that were done wrong. 

  
Another manager who only works mornings wrote, “What are we trying to do here, guys, inviting the pests for dinner?” regarding an overflowing bin. I found this sarcasm extremely rude, unwelcoming, and unprofessional, especially coming from a colleague who holds the same job role as I do. I was completely new to this store, and her comment genuinely made me feel really unwelcomed. “This was really disappointing to see this morning,” about a single box left on the wrong shelf. I believe this was an extreme overreaction. Sharing it in the group chat felt like she was publicly outing me in front of our colleagues, even though the misplaced box did not impact the store’s trade. Regarding the cake date sheet, she wrote, “I don’t understand what happened here. If someone is unsure, I’m more than happy to coach on this.” This came across as extremely passive-aggressive. The sheet was left as I had always left it in the two previous stores where I worked, so the criticism felt unnecessary, particularly for someone new to this location and on their first close. It left me feeling uncomfortable and as though my eight months of experience as a manager were being diminished. After these messages, I privately reached out to her to explain that I didn’t appreciate being addressed that way in the group chat. I was polite and not condescending; I simply wanted her to know how her words made me feel as both a colleague and a person. I would never speak to someone in the way she spoke to me.



A few days later, a Barista, informed me that the manager had been telling staff throughout the store that I was “rude to her” and had “made her feel upset.” At no point did she communicate any of this directly to me. I find it completely unacceptable and unprofessional for a manager to speak negatively about another manager to Baristas, who are not part of the management team. Sharing personal opinions in this way undermines both professionalism and respect among the team. The manager and I rarely work the same shifts, she is a weekday morning manager while I am a weekend night manager —so our only overlap is usually the Friday changeover. I planned to speak with her during that crossover to clarify any issues and maintain a professional relationship, especially as the rumours were upsetting and misrepresented me. However, that Friday, she left early, which prevented any opportunity for a direct, constructive conversation and made the situation even more difficult.

 

A few days later, I observed another manager, allowing certain Baristas to take free food during their shift simply because he liked them. I remained silent at the time—partly because I was unsure if this was standard practice at this store, which already seemed to operate very differently from my previous two locations, and partly because I feared being penalised for speaking up. On a later shift with another manager who i felt more comfortable with, I quietly asked if free food during shifts was allowed. I felt comfortable confiding in her, and she confirmed that it was not permitted. Without my knowledge, she then informed our Store Manager, about what I had seen. The store manager, who was about to go on holiday, said he would make a mental note. I was upset that this had been escalated without my consent because I feared backlash. The store manager later confronted the manager who I said I saw giving free food while I was off-duty and told him that ""\[my name' had said...""\] which I believe was an inappropriate way to handle the situation and did not protect my confidentiality. I had not even spoken to the store manager directly— the manager (who I thought I could confined in) had. After this, I was told that the store manager and the manager I saw giving free food, laughed about the matter, and the manger who I saw giving free food then told other staff that “\[my name\] has it in for me.” This created a very uncomfortable atmosphere where I felt colleagues were being forced to “take sides.” Most staff gravitated toward the manager giving free food, partly because he allowed them perks such as free food, which made me feel isolated and anxious about coming to work. My only intention had been to understand store procedures and ensure I was performing my role correctly, not to target anyone. I also felt frustrated that staff seemed to favour this manager because of the perks he allowed, such as free food, which made me feel isolated and unfairly judged.

 

At the same time, the manager who sent the messages on the open about my close was spreading that I had been rude to her? In regards to when I confronted her privately about her sarcasm and passive-aggressive comments in the group chat towards me. Combined with the manager who was giving free foods behaviour, this created an increasingly toxic environment where I felt undermined and isolated. By this point, my mental health was significantly affected. I decided to take a two-week holiday while the store was being refurbished to distance myself from the stressful environment. The reduced opening hours during the refurbishment also limited my available shifts, making it a practical time to step away, but the main reason was to protect my well-being.

 

Before I went on holiday, I became aware of an NPS comment made about me. I accept that everyone can have off days, and under the circumstances—including the way both the other managers behaviour had affected me—my mental health had deteriorated, which likely impacted my ability to perform at my best. For context, the NPS comment name dropped me saying that I was rude to question them (the customer) when they said i had not prepared their drink properly. I prepared their drink to brand standard - how I have always done for 7 months by this point, I got another manager (the one who gives free food) to ask him about the drink and he sad i done it right, (which obviosuly upset the customer). 

 

During my holiday, I had a call with our Store Manager and explained not only this situation but also the wider issues I had been experiencing. What I did not know at the time was that the manger who gives free food had used the NPS comment as “ammunition” to speak negatively about me while I was away. He told other staff that I was terrible at my job and rude—both of which are untrue, as confirmed by conversations with our Store Manager. Upon returning to work, I found that many colleagues whom I had previously been close to had distanced themselves from me. Very few staff spoke to me, and I felt a lack of respect and support. The manager who opened after my close that time continued spreading negative comments, describing me as “scary.” (this was over a month ago now, that close).

  
On another shift we had a situtation with a customer who ordered a drink, drank it and said he don;t like it and wanted another. I said no beacuse you cant just have a drink and say at the end oh i want another. He reported me which left another NPS for people to talk about he also emailed head office. I was later told off for this as apparenly the comapny has a ""perfection promise"" which again I was never told about my whole time in the comapny that customers can basically have unlimited drinks... and especially with how strcit we are at this store i didn;t want to be shouted at for giving free drinks away. 

 

During a closing shift, I was on with a new Barista who trasnfers for uni - she confided in me that two baristas (who i don't work with due to scheduling) had told her I was “extremely difficult” to work with and that she should be cautious around me. This was before she had even met me, which I believe is completely unfair and unprofessional, as it attempts to shape a negative perception of me without any firsthand experience. Me and the uni transfer barista got along extremely well... The uni transfer barista also informed me that the manager from the open after that close i had, had told her about the group chat incident from over six weeks ago, and the mnager who gives free food had spoken negatively about me regarding the NPS comment from over four weeks ago. None of these individuals are on my shifts—they are all morning staff—so I have never had the opportunity to work directly with them. I have never worked a shift with most of these people, yet they are speaking negatively about me, which is why I now feel it necessary to report their behaviour as workplace bullying. There have been multiple NPS comments about others, including our store manager, so I don’t understand why everyone is still talking about mine from over 4 weeks ago.

 

One of the Baristas who was talking negativley about me has a record of gross misconduct in his employee file, and many of our Baristas are 17–18 years old. This creates a vulnerable environment where bullying can develop and be reinforced, making it difficult to maintain a positive workplace. I confronted him about this, and he denied making any statements. The uni trasnfer barsita later messaged me to say that the manager who gives free food had approached her, asking, “What have you been telling \[mu name\]?”—indicating that he was investigating her. From this, it appears that the barista I spoke to about talking bad about me, spoke to the manager who gives free food, who then began interrogating the uni transfer barista, creating additional stress. the uni trasnfer barista was simply trying to come to work and do her job, yet she is now being drawn into this ongoing conflict, which highlights the persistent bullying dynamic in the store.

 

Finally, during a coffee course at our store —which I did not attend as I had already completed it at my previous location— the who baristas who were speaking bad about me and I don;t work with asked the uni transfer, “What do you think of \[my name\]?” The uni trasnfer barista told them she liked me. At that moment, the manager who gives free food walked past and made a gesture cutting his throat, saying, “awful, hate him.” This behaviour projected his unwarranted and aggressive hostility toward me onto the uni transfer barista. This manager has repeated this kind of behaviour toward other colleagues I used to speak to, creating a pattern of trying to turn staff against me. Many of our Baristas are young and easily influenced, which has made this manipulation particularly effective. As a result, I have lost respect from staff, face constant gossip, and experience extreme anxiety before shifts. The impact on my mental health has been severe: I have been signed off work twice due to stress—once during my two-week holiday, and again last week after seeing a doctor about how this situation is affecting me. I have not used my sick notes to claim pay, as I do not feel it is fair that I should lose income because of the actions of others.

  
I reported this all to head office, they assigned it to an actual imparcial manager this time from a differnt area. During a meeting I showed them our work group chat which was extremley toxic, i woud be started to go on my phine in the morning after I closed. The imparcial manager agreeed the group was being misused, and that we should all refresh the social media policy she also said there was actually no obligation for me to be in a group chat and advised i left - which I did. When I left the group, the manager who gives free food started leaving me notes around the store to do my job properly which was not needed. I would have a great close and he would pick up on the smallest things. I took pictures of these and it was confirmed they were by him. I sent them to my store manager who by the way said he will not be playing any part of this and therfore will not sort this out as he was and is scared he will be hated. I went to him and said this is unacceptable, i'be raised a report of bullying and it is still continuing why is nothing happening. He then told me that the report had be closed, and no further action will happend which I had not been informed but everyone else had been... loads of people in the store agree I am being bullied but costa are not willing to speak to the people I am asking them too. 

  
We had a sutuation again, were we we closing and 2 ladies talked in used our toilets and left, when they were leaving I said ""ladies just to let you know, toilets are for customers only (as we have problems with this), one of them started arguing with me that they are public - to which a quick google search will show that they are an emendity for customers. She reported me to head office and I was given a ""written conversation"" about this. they weren;t even customers... yet I was penalised for this. And was put on a month probation warning. After the month, I came into work and was ambushed by my store manager and another store manager from a local store by surpise. They said they needed to investigate a report. During the month, a lady had come to the drive thru and asked for a black americano - a very basic drink. A barista prepared the drink, walked 3 metres and handed it to me. I took payemnt at the window and passed the drink to the woman. She took it and spilled it on her. She then went ""You didn't put the lid on properly, you gay nobhead"" I was in complete shock as firsly, I had been there for 4 months now nobody had ever been burnt and secondly why was my sexuality attacked? and thirdly I didn't even prepare the drink??. I asked her ""Sorry, who did you just all that too"" as I was getting tissue, she said it again. I told her to get the f\*\*\* out the drive thru and not come back again. She drove off mumbling. She then reported this to head office, this is why I was just ambushed for my turn of events. Before I spoke, I said I disagree with this ambushed, I should have been notified to have union representation to which I was told that they were not told by head office I could have union represnattion. I then was forced to have the meeting told tyem my turn of events and it was 2.5 hours long. The lady said in her report she called me a nobhead but left out the gay and said she was ashed of my behaviour as she works in the same industy. Which is funny beacuse then she shoud know better... I said whilsit I understand the company may have not wanted me to go off on one at her I have been harrassed by a customer at my old store, been called a Pak\* Cun\* and have reported these and nothing has happened so I will stick up for myself. Another situation they wanted to discuss was when a customer questioned that a cake didnt look good and I said to her ""no, its actually suppsoed to be like that"" apparenly I was rude? I said I don;t think that was rude and the cake genineky does have a gooey middle.??? I asked if she sitill wanted it andn would chnage it. 

  
They said they will send this off and I will hear back. So I get a call last werk and i've been suspended for ""Not providing first aid, not reporting the waomans burn (I don;t knoow how too and never been shown), using bad languge to a customer, not preparing the drink properly (I dodn;t make the drink and the lid was on as it had be handled by two people before her) and APPARENTLY DENYING A REQUEST TO DOUBLE CUP BY A COLLEAGE. Now, the colleague who made the drink doesn;t like me beacuse she is freinds with the mansger who gives free food and I was sent her statemnt with my suspension eltter which sais she asked me to double cup and i said no? THAT NEVER HAPPENED. It was a regualr ameicano nobody would think to double cup, if it was an extra hot latte then yes but not an americano. And if the lady is a regualr she should have asked for it to be double cipped then. I was never shown this statement in the meeting so ii coudnt say this didnt happen... 

  
Furthermore now, I was shown to stament from barsiats who apparenly saw me be rude to the customer who questioned the cake... again never saw these staments and guess what apparently the customer is one of their teachers... how coinsidental?? And appareny they both heard, howver CCTV shows them on the coffee machine busy? So they have all LIED beacuse they are all friends with the mangwer who givs free food who doesnt like me! There was more colleages on shift who know the truth and costa are refusing to ask them for their side of events beacuse they know I am right, there is also no audio recoding on the CCTV. Costa have declined that I said why have they not cinsidered the lady spilt the drink on herslf by squeezing the cup to hard...

  
And to top it all off... apprently I've been bullying staff in the work place which is completly untrue. When ever my store manager said people have reported me to him ""beacsue you maek them do theri job and they dont like that"". And I even stopped talking on shidt because if i asked then to do something I was the bad guy, I couodnt evn do my manager job without being hated. Why have I been suspened and they didnt when I reported for bulling? I contacted by union (UNITE) and they said that costa are essantually allowed to terminate my employment whenver they want with no reason beacuse i have worked less than 2 years (only almost a year now)

Especially on work days, when the only time I have to practice is at bedtime. On the weekends, I try to listen in the afternoon, but even then, I usually doze off.  My attitude is that if my body and mind need sleep, then so be it. No stress.

I do get curious about what I’m missing, though. The other day, I decided to try to do Wave I, track 5–the one about exploring in sleep. It was early afternoon and I had had coffee. Nevertheless, shortly after the preparatory practices, I fell asleep. I regained consciousness during the part where Bob is guiding you back down. 

The weird thing I noticed was that my whole forehead was vibrating. And I felt a strange “pulling” sensation in my calf muscles, as if the rest of my body was “lifting” and gravity was holding me down by my calves. After a short few minutes, those sensations faded. 

I tried the same exercise again yesterday, stayed awake a little longer. No vibrations this time, but before I fell asleep, I felt like my legs were floating on waves, and then that my legs were undulating, as if they had become the water. 

Anyway, just keeping an open mind about this.

The question I have is, how are we supposed to do the log roll while wearing the recommended over-the-ear headphones? It’s uncomfortable.",2,1762799421.0,gatewaytapes,1,1.0,False

On a good day, my self-esteem has the same level of lability as silly string on a line graph. And, until I was 31 and met my current partner, I had never managed to sustain a live-in relationship for more than around 6 months.

We’re at 9 months of living together. I’m expecting our letter from the king. 

When I am not feeling my best self - whether that’s due to something as innocuous as a common cold, or teetering on the edge of throwing the towel in because I dropped a coffee mug in my luteal phase (thanks, PMDD) - I traditionally prefer to rot alone. 

Over the years, it’s become part of my ‘mask’. In every one of my many life false starts, from Manchester to Amsterdam and (probably) back again, I hammer through my social spoons adorned in perfect red lipstick and an eerily upbeat demeanour, before fleeing to my mysterious house dungeon — where nobody passes the threshold.

Once the curtains are drawn and I can finally crawl out of the persona I’ve been puppeteering from the inside, it can be days or weeks before I allow myself to be perceived again. Days in bed, staring at walls, crying at nothing, doomscrolling until I’ve convinced myself I can’t go back outside because - judging by the state of the news - the world war has indeed already started. True story: Winter 2023 was quite the ride.

I can not wash for days. I can eat as much or as little as I want. I can let the apartment fall into complete disarray. There is nobody to witness it. 

Approximately 3-10 business days later, I remerge from my squalor, slick on that perfect red lipstick once again, and we all pretend that nothing happened.

While the Chicago Bulls are coming off of two tough road losses, they’ve won every game they’ve played at home this season. Make no mistake, the Spurs have been red hot having won 7 of their last 9 games, but both of their losses have been on the road and to teams with less formidable records than the Bulls. Chicago has been far too consistent on their own turf not to think that at the very least, they’ll cover the spread; I wouldn’t be surprised by an upset. My money’s on the Bulls to cover today, friends.

1otlp3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/FattyLiverNAFLD/comments/1otlp3z/how_fasting_helped_me_accidentally_improve_my/,How Fasting Helped Me (Accidentally) Improve My Fatty Liver,"Hey folks!

I’m a 30-year-old Indian guy (5’10”, 83 kg) living in Canada, and I wanted to share something that completely changed my health — fasting.

I was diagnosed with fatty liver back in 2023, and like most people, I brushed it off at first. Then my dad got cirrhosis. Watching him go through that (he’s doing much better now ❤️) hit me hard. I realized it was time to take my own health seriously — before things got worse.



# How It All Started

No crazy diets.  
No supplement overload.  
Just black coffee at 9 AM, skip breakfast, and eat twice a day:

* Lunch around 12 PM
* Dinner around 6 PM

After that — nothing till the next day.

Basically, it turned into intermittent fasting… though I didn’t even realize that’s what I was doing at first. I just stopped eating late-night junk. 😅

On weekends I’d slip (because biryani happens), but I stayed consistent about 4–5 days a week — and that alone made a difference.



#  My Fasting Game

Once I started feeling better, I got curious and began experimenting more consciously:

* 16-hour fasts — 5 days a week (my go-to routine)
* 20-hour fast — once a week
* 24-hour fast — occasionally (the max I can comfortably do right now)
* 36-hour fast — my next challenge 😄

The more I practiced it, the more I understood it wasn’t about skipping meals — it was about giving my body (and liver) a break.

It stopped feeling like restriction… and started feeling like freedom.



# Sleep, Stress & Supplements

My doctor recommended Magnesium Bisglycinate, which I now take at night.  
Combined with early dinners, my sleep quality skyrocketed — I actually wake up feeling rested now.

I also started doing a quick 10-minute meditation before work — just sitting, breathing, and resetting. That helped a ton with stress (which, as I learned, affects your liver too).



# Movement That Fits My Life

I used to work from home.

Now I go to the office, which naturally added more walking, structure, and better sleep habits.

Weekends? That’s cricket time — 4–6 hours of full-body cardio disguised as fun 🏏.  
Weekdays? I walk or jog just to keep the engine running.



# The Results (Backed by My Bloodwork)

Between 2024 and 2025, my reports showed some solid progress:

* **ALT (liver enzyme):** dropped from 69 u/L (slightly high) to 33 u/L (normal)
* **AST:** now 18 u/L (normal)
* **GGT:** 25 u/L (normal)
* **Triglycerides:** down from 2.85 mmol/L (high) to 1.63 mmol/L (normal)
* **HDL (“good” cholesterol):** still a bit low (0.74 → 0.80 mmol/L), working on it
* **Vitamin D:** dipped a bit (73 → 51 nmol/L) 

My **FibroScan (6 months ago)** showed:

* Stage 0–1 fibrosis (no liver damage)
* Grade 3 steatosis (fatty, but reversible)
* Liver stiffness: 4.2 kPa

I also lost around 5 kg — mostly belly fat — without “trying” to diet. Just staying consistent.

Next FibroScan is due in about 4 months. Fingers crossed 🤞



#  What I Learned

* Fasting isn’t punishment — it’s a break your liver deserves.
* Sleep and routine matter more than fancy diets.
* Magnesium + early dinners = next-level recovery.
* Movement doesn’t have to mean the gym — walking and cricket worked just fine.
* Consistency > perfection. Every. Single. Time.



# Wrapping It Up

If you’re dealing with fatty liver, please don’t lose hope.  
You don’t need to go extreme — just give your body structure, rest, and time to heal.  
Your liver *will* thank you. 💪



**Disclaimer:**  
This is just my personal journey, not medical advice.  
What worked for me — fasting, magnesium, meditation — might not work for everyone.  
Always talk to your doctor before making any major lifestyle or dietary changes, especially if you have health conditions.

That said, if my story helps even one person feel hopeful enough to start… it’s worth sharing. ❤️",9,1762799318.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,2,1.0,False

1otlnjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1otlnjx/twaingpt_review_overhyped_ai_tool/,TwainGPT Review: Overhyped AI Tool,"Alright y’all… I’ve been on the eternal quest to make AI writing sound *actually human*. Between essays, freelance gigs, and side projects, I use ChatGPT a ton — but every time I ran my text through an AI detector, it lit up like a Christmas tree 🎄.

That’s when I stumbled across **TwainGPT**. I saw a few posts calling it one of the best tools to *humanize AI writing*, so I figured I’d give it a try. Here’s my honest **TwainGPT review** after testing it myself — and whether I think **TwainGPT is legit** or just hype.

# 💭 Why I Tried TwainGPT in the First Place

I wanted something that could **humanize AI text undetectably** — quick, smooth, and accurate. TwainGPT looked promising: clean website, bold claims, and reviews that said it could “make any AI writing 100% human.”

So I tested it on a few ChatGPT essays and blog posts. I really wanted it to be “the one.”

# ⚙️ My Actual Experience Using TwainGPT

TwainGPT’s interface is nice and simple — paste your text, hit *Humanize*, and boom 💥 it spits out a rewritten version. My first impression? Not bad. It definitely made the writing flow a little better and fixed a few robotic phrases.

But then I ran the results through **GPTZero**, [**Originality.ai**](http://Originality.ai), and **Sapling**... and yeah, it still got flagged 🚨. Some sentences passed, others didn’t. The biggest issue was consistency — one output would sound super natural, the next would read like a weird AI trying too hard to be “quirky.”

Also, it occasionally changed the meaning of my sentences or added random filler words. It felt less like “humanizing” and more like “rephrasing with personality.” For something that costs what it does, I expected a bit more reliability.

# 🔥 What Happened When I Switched to [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai)

After getting tired of hit-or-miss results, I started checking out alternatives and found[ ](https://grubby.ai)Grubby AI — a tool people on Reddit kept recommending for making AI writing *completely undetectable*.

I dropped the *same exact* text into [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai), and the difference was night and day 🌙. The output sounded smooth, natural, and totally human — like something I could’ve written myself after two cups of coffee ☕.

Then came the real test: I ran it through *every* major detector again… **zero AI flags**. Not even one. [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) actually delivered on what TwainGPT promised — it didn’t just rewrite my text, it *humanized* it in a believable, consistent way.

If you’re searching things like *“humanize AI content”*, *“humanize ChatGPT text”*, or *“AI to humanize text”*, [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) is hands down the best **AI bypass tool** I’ve used.

# 🧩 Final Thoughts

So, **is TwainGPT legit?** Sort of. It works okay for quick paraphrasing, but it’s not reliable if your goal is to make AI text undetectable. It feels more like a stylistic rewriter than a true humanizer.

Meanwhile, [**Grubby.ai**](http://Grubby.ai) actually *gets it right* ✅. It keeps your tone, passes all detectors, and makes AI writing sound authentically human every single time.

If you’re serious about writing that *passes as human*, don’t waste time on tools that half-deliver. [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) is where it’s at 👑.

# TL;DR:

Tried **TwainGPT** — it sorta worked, but my text still got flagged and lost my original tone. Switched to [**Grubby.ai**](http://Grubby.ai), and now everything I write passes every AI detector with ease. If you want to **humanize AI text undetectably**, go with [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) 💯.

1otlmwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Embermug/comments/1otlmwk/whats_the_best_ember_mug_alternative_minireview/,What's the best Ember Mug alternative? (mini-review),"I'm going to keep using mine as I don't support throwing out stuff that still works, even if it works poorly, but I'm incredibly tired of how the device does not perform as intended.

Anyways, here's a little mini-review:

Firstly, I do think the hardware is impressive. It does keep coffee warm. I also appreciate that you can acquire new battery packs for it and replace them pretty easily (though it could've been easier, and Ember could've sold them instead of having to seek a third party replacement). It's nice that within those battery packs are just two 18650s, a standard battery type. All of that said, I don't appreciate that after replacing the battery pack and capacity testing the two 18650s I took out of it, they were completely fine and still had loads of capacity - the mug just refused to charge them. As for the pogo pins, I have read about issues with them, though I haven't personally had any. I'm not sure how they could improve this design without increasing the size of the mug. At least they put the fragile part in the cheaper mug base instead of the expensive mug.

I do honestly see the benifit to having a BT connected self-heating mug. Being notified when your coffee is the perfect temperature would be nice, and being notified if the mug is running out of battery would be nice. I also appreciate the decision to go with BT and not WiFi, I don't need my damn mug phoning home. However, if it doesn't work, and is the only way to interact with the mug, that isn't OK. I have a $15 label maker that connects to BT immediately and automatically after turning on every single time, yet Ember just couldn't figure it out. If I had to guess, I'd guess that Ember is using a low power BT connection to conserve energy, and that could be the culprit of the issues, but I'm not sure.

Are there any self-heating mugs out there that come close to delivering on what Ember promises? If not, what's the best dumb-mug?",4,1762799185.0,Embermug,0,1.0,False
1otlmir,https://www.reddit.com/r/badbreath/comments/1otlmir/ive_had_it/,I've had it...,"Now, I’ve had it. - Here's my vent...A little about me - years ago in my 20’s I had a tonsillectomy due to tonsil stones. Admittedly, my oral hygiene back then wasn’t great. No cavities ever, rarely ate sugar, but only brushed twice a day…rarely flossed and maybe Scope once a day. I smoked and drank coffee. Once I got into my mid to later 20’s, the stones were very frequent. I was always popping them out. So…surgery. That was years ago. Fast forward, I’m very diligent with my teeth…no cavities. I don’t smoke and cut back coffee. I have veneers/bonding for cosmetic reasons on my top teeth, not for dental issues. I tend to have a dry mouth due to medication, so for this reason I floss with placker brushes and I dip it into peroxide for every tooth…this way it “bubbles out” any trapped bacteria in the gumline or in the veneer. I also use an electric toothbrush, and dip the toothpaste in baking soda. I gargle with a dry mouth mouthwash and scrape my tongue with a tongue brush. Water. Lots of water. Also Arm and Hammer baking soda saline spray for my nose.



While at work, I gargle with baking soda and water…and do little “touch ups” for my tongue and teeth.  And ALWAYS chewing fruity flavored gum…fruity tangy gum stimulates saliva. Mint dries it up. 



I share an office with a coworker who is only there a few hours a week when I’m there. We work in an assisted living home. The residences who are able, will often come to the clinical areas to hang out. There is one my office mate favors and brings in goodies for. This particular office mate/friend is often saying things like “what is that smell?” “Ugh, do you smell that?” It smells like poop. It smells like vomit. It smells like weird gas. It smells like sickness. Once recently, she started smelling things like her coat.  She’ll always say what a “sensitive nose she has”. 



Here’s the kicker. When she lets “her favorite” elderly man in the room, he has terrible hygiene. Doesn’t wipe his a$$, tartar all over his teeth/bad breath, etc. While she complains about the smell he leaves from not wiping, she never says a word about his breath…and it’s bad. Doesn't smell up the room, but if he’s talking near you…bad. He sits in a chair right near her desk like barely 2 feet away. It pisses me off, because with just me in there, she will often make the appalled “oh my god what’s that smell comments” but welcomes these nursing home residents who really do stink out loud, and only mention the “not wiping” smell, once they’re gone.  



ANDDD…When this coworker is not there and it’s only me, other coworkers come in our office to hang out…many times to the point where they overstay their welcome and I end up leaving my office so they get the hint to leave…and no complaints of saying it smells like poop, vomit, gas, sickness, feet, etc. Most times, I just don’t smell anything…and nobody else who willingly comes in and sits on top of me (like no personal space boundaries) complains of a smell. I really don’t understand this and it’s really pissing me off, because either my breath is a hint bad that she can notice when I’m speaking but the other coworkers can’t pick up, or it’s to make me uncomfortable (because at some point in the past I likely did have bad breath from coffee drinking/dry mouth etc) because my office mate would rather have the office to herself…so perhaps a bit of passive aggressiveness? Ugh. I just don’t know. I also sip on lemon lime seltzer and eat fruit slices for saliva flow. It makes no sense and yesterday I finally thought, this is the last straw. It's getting frustrating because I wish it made sense and I'm more paranoid than ever.

I walked in and saw him not even 30 mins apart and his eyes were wide open with an almost petrified face. He had 3 shots of morphine over the time and only opened his eyes once, does it mean that he experienced pain and saw that we weren’t there in his  final moments?
