*** How do share the pictures?  It won‚Äôt allow a link and only allows for attaching one photo?  I know it‚Äôs user error on my part but I‚Äôm lost


First, thank you all so much for your help!  

The Cashmere Grey and Windham Cream are unlikely to change, so I do need to focus on colors for the living and dining room that will pull it together (or at least not clash).  Since I want to do wallpaper on the far wall of the dining room which be visible from the entry, I‚Äôve added some pictures with some possible options but I can‚Äôt link them.  I‚Äôll try to do that in the comments. I‚Äôm thinking that if I settle on a wallpaper that can drive the color choice for the dining room.  You‚Äôll notice that the wallpaper examples are varied in style, I‚Äôm open to them all.

A few more things to share based on comments from the previous post 

* We‚Äôll be purchasing new couch, chairs coffee tables etc for the formal living room.  I do have several antiques that I‚Äôll try to work in but the overall desired effect is eclectic,  to Victorian.  So I have the opportunity to bring in additional complementary colors like those suggested on the previous thread in the soft furniture, window treatments and rugs. 

* We‚Äôll be using the antique round walnut dining table but we need new chairs.  The current china closet is not staying, so we might replace or get a sideboard.

* Lighting in the entry is very warm, would making that cooler to tone down the  Windham Cream be a good idea?  Lighting in the kitchen is bright with the overheads,  it we also have under cabinet lighting, and the lighting in the family room and over the small table is dimmable.  I still need to get lamps etc for the family room.

So if you read all or some of this, I thank you!  Any and all suggestions for a wallpaper and then paint color for the rest of the dining room and living room would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks?

Philipp winked at the crowd over his shoulder, making sure they all got a look at his chiseled chin and dimples before spinning around to face Nestle's chairman, Paul Bulcke.

I've lived in the same neighborhood in San Francisco since I was a kid. I've often noticed an older man in the neighborhood who frequents a coffee shop I like. He has some sort of tremor that seems to pretty significantly affect his fine motor and balance. I've seen him fall over multiple times in a row while walking, although I've always been across a busy street or otherwise too far away to offer any help, and he gets up and moves on pretty quickly. In recent years I've seen him packing up a sleeping bag into his backpack, leading me to believe he has been struggling with housing. He's always well groomed, clothes not noticeably dirty, and only carries a medium sized backpack with him, so it's not totally obvious if he actually is currently homeless or not. 

For whatever reason I can't stop worrying about him. Maybe because I've seen him since I was a kid, maybe because it makes me sad to think that someone with a disability that affects their everyday functioning could be living on the street, but I really want to do something to help him. Overall, he seems very capable of taking care of himself and is definitely sound of mind, but I just feel worried about him. 

I would like to somehow try to befriend him so I can learn more about his situation and if there is anything I could do to help, but I'm not really sure how to go about this. He's never panhandling or otherwise doing anything that would give much of an opportunity to strike up a conversation. For those of you who have experience being ""invisibly"" homeless (ie most people wouldn't notice you are homeless) would you be weirded out by someone randomly approaching you and introducing themselves? Do you have any suggestions for how I could go about doing this in a non-creepy way? Or suggestions of other things I could do that might help or brighten his day, keeping in mind that he is not visibly homeless (and in fact may not even be homeless at all anymore for all I know). 

My boyfriend has pointed out that my pity and help may be completely unwanted, and I know this is true. I don't want to make him feel like I pity him or like I'm helping him out to feed my own ego. I just genuinely feel concerned for a person that has been a part of my local community for years, and it has been causing me to feel really sad recently.

i (18F) have been with my boyfriend (18M) for 11 months. he has honestly been an amazing boyfriend throughout our relationship (getting me flowers, taking me on dates, spending time with my family, etc.).

but i recently found out (a week ago) that three days before he asked me to be his girlfriend, he made out with another girl...twice on two different occasions... all i knew is that they made out twice, not knowing any other details or their extents. i forgave him too easily, because he apologized so many times and was so sweet about the situation.

yesterday, while we were watching season 3 ep 1 of the summer i turned pretty, the truth about jeremiah cheating on belly in cabo comes out. it reminded me of the time he made out with this girl twice, and i asked for specific details. i asked what they did exactly and the extent of all of it. i found out the first time was in his car after a party (they just made out), and the second time was in HER BED. that time in her bed, they made out and he also grabbed her chest area....

what hurts the most is that he didnt just tell me the whole story upfront when i first learned about it. he downplayed it and just told me these details. he has apologized multiple times, saying that i am his everything. he claims that those moments meant nothing.

i really love him, but cant stop thinking about the fact that he hid this from me for our whole relationship. do you guys think this is something i should break up with him over, or do i give him another chance since it happened just when he first started dating?

Out of vengeance, I‚Äôm going to write a Yelp review of the new Zucchero Caf√© on the Elmo.

2/5

I am a professional, independent, anonymous restaurant critic.

Recently, Zucchero Caf√© opened a new branch on the Elmo, and let me tell you‚Äîit‚Äôs an absolute train wreck.

Almost everything on the menu tastes like pure sugar. My taste buds are insulted by the sheer amount of sweetness they‚Äôre forced to endure. Colphne is terrified I‚Äôm going to end up with diabetes. I even tried talking to the owner, but she jokingly dismissed me. I suppose she‚Äôs got too much American influence in her neural cloud. Not even the best I.O.P. engineers can fix the American obsession with destroying their bodies with sugar.

I miss Lee-Enfield‚Ä¶ at least she wasn‚Äôt trying to give me diabetes. Anyway‚Ä¶

The design itself is iconic‚Äîit really does look like the bar we had during the Griffin days. Unfortunately, the furniture vaguely smells like cat piss for some reason. I saw G36 desperately trying to clean it, but it seems she failed miserably.

There‚Äôs also a huge privacy issue in the whole caf√©. Yesterday I just wanted to drink my coffee in peace, but I noticed all the tactical dolls around me constantly glaring and giggling. It‚Äôs literally impossible to relax when everyone comes back from dispatch missions.

And whatever you do, never go to the caf√© on Thursday. They let someone named ‚ÄúMakiatto‚Äù cook. Just trust me, it‚Äôs not worth it. I genuinely try to give her the longest dispatch missions on Thursdays, yet she somehow finishes them in half the expected time. It‚Äôs genuinely terrifying.

In conclusion, if I were you, I wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to visit the Elmo just for Zucchero Caf√©. It kinda sucks.

For the first time in years, I can honestly say I feel good. My mood is stable around 6/10 consistently, my energy is calm and steady, sleep is improving, and I don't have that constant anxiety that coffee used to give me.

But here's the thing that's messing with my head, I have absolutely ZERO motivation to do anything productive. I'm a writer and musician, and normally I'd be working on projects, practicing, creating stuff. But right now, I can't even bring myself to write a single sentence or play a chord. It's not that I feel bad, I actually feel fine. I just have no drive whatsoever.

This is creating a weird mental conflict. Part of me thinks ""You feel good, you should be productive now!"" but reality is ""I literally cannot motivate myself to do anything"" which leads to ""Maybe something is still wrong with me?""

I'm starting to realize this might be WHY I always self-sabotage when I'm doing well. When I feel good but can't produce anything, it creates this uncomfortable cognitive dissonance. Going back to coffee gives me that artificial ""push"" and motivation boost, even though it only lasts 2 days and makes me anxious.

So I'm wondering if this is normal? Did anyone else experience this ""good but unmotivated"" phase? How long does it last and when did your natural motivation start coming back? Also how do you resist the temptation to go back to caffeine just for that productivity boost?

I know I should probably just accept this phase and wait it out, but it's harder than I expected. The lack of drive feels almost scarier than feeling bad because at least when I felt bad, I had a clear reason why I wasn't being productive.",3,1756763434.0,decaf,3,1.0,False

Last time I had this happen to me, I was able to buy a house in the middle of COVID while working at a grocery store. For context, I was sitting in my bed putting on socks. Then I randomly felt something on both of my feet. When I took my socks off I found old dried poop on the heels of both of my feet. I know I didn't step on them. They just appeared as if an entity put them there. I had really good luck afterwards and was able to buy a house with the lowest price and interest rate, before the housing market went crazy. That was 5 years ago around this time of the year.

Today, I was sitting at my kitchen table, sipping on my coffee and hanging out with my wife. I had been smelling poop but I thought it was from the cat litter. I touched my feet instinctively and there was just a little streak of poop on the side of my big toe. Had I stepped on poop, it would be on the bottom of my feet. I checked my crocs that I wore in the morning to take my dog out and there was no poop on it whatsoever. I hope this brings me good luck like last time. The current economic state has been rough. I want to know if there are others that have experienced this. ",1,1756763179.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False
1n61n8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n61n8f/confessions_of_a_dying_serial_killer_queer_horror/,Confessions of a Dying Serial Killer (Queer Horror!),"*Author's Note: In light of this week's episode being the first with a gay main character, as well as a flop, I decided to post part one of the queer horror story I've been working on. I've only written up to part two, so let me know if you guys like it!*

  
**Part I**

They say I killed over forty people, though physical evidence could tie me back to only seven. DNA evidence, the prosecutors called it. Trace amounts of hair or blood, as well as skin, contain a genetic code unique to each individual. There was no arguing my involvement; the jury gave me death.¬†

The doctors tell me the virus will finish me long before the state does. Truth be told, that feels like the crueler execution. California was quick to bring back the death penalty, but slower to admit the sickness killing half the men on this block was even real.

So, I‚Äôve committed myself to writing down as much as I can remember. Not in some vain attempt to judicate myself post mortem- but as a warning to those who would have been victimized by me. The dark and ancient forces that drove me to commit my crimes remain out there, at large and endlessly hungry.¬†

For many years, I was a family man. A loving wife and two daughters, a beautiful suburban home. In 1977, I disappeared unexpectedly, and when the authorities finally found me, they arrested me for the kidnapping and killing of several young men in the Bay Area.¬†



*September 9th, 1977: Day of Dissappearance*

I put the car in reverse and let my foot off the brake, drifting slowly, cloudlike out of the driveway and onto our idyllic cul-de-sac. Modest but recently built two-story homes were spaced evenly on either side of the street. Each with its unique fixtures which did not distract from the overall resemblance of the subdivision. My daughters chatted idly in the backseat of our Ford Pinto Wagon as I drove them to school that morning.¬†

The scene has a fuzzy, dreamlike quality to it in my memory. The open window blowing about golden strands of hair, the morning sun gleaming off the green of the girls‚Äô eyes, the way they laughed lightly at the day ahead of them. As a parent, these small, fleeting moments of watching your children grow up will always be remembered with a sort of fondness, a longing to slow down the passage of time. Let them grow up just a little less quickly.¬†

However, I imagine *this* morning, *these* fleeting moments, in *that* car on *that* drive, my parental sentimentality holds especially true because I wouldn‚Äôt see my daughters for another 12 years. The next time we spoke, they had shed their youth and become strong, resilient, and beautiful young women. Some of that strength, no doubt, is a direct result of my sudden, inexplicable absence from their lives, interrupted only by my highly publicized arrest.

The girls‚Äô school was only a few miles from our home. As I turned onto another tree-shaded street, I took notice of a woman standing in the middle of the road. She had short, black hair cropped stylishly around her high cheekbones. Her slender frame filled her tracksuit pleasantly in all the places a man would want, if one were such a man.¬†

Her eyes remained locked on mine from the moment we‚Äôd turned onto the street, as if she could see farther and with more precision than the average person. I pulled the car up beside her, coming to a rolling stop, my window already down.¬†

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I offered, wanting to be friendly.¬†

She eyed me seductively and lowered the zipper of her tracksuit, exposing more of her cleavage. She leaned into the open window, close enough for me to feel her hot breath on my face.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù she replied. It was clear the woman intended to flirt with me, but she‚Äôd gravely misjudged her target.

‚ÄúOut for a run?‚Äù I asked, wanting to keep the conversation casual. At this, our oldest, Lilith, gripped the front seat, pulling herself up to whisper into my ear.¬†

‚ÄúDad, she's covered in blood.‚Äù I looked over the woman again, sweat was beading from her forehead and had dampened parts of her short hair. Her red tracksuit was similarly damp around the armpits and chest, but the woman looked otherwise clean.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be rude, Lil,‚Äù I said dismissively, not taking my eyes off the woman who seemed to be growing impatient with each passing moment. ‚ÄúWe'd better get moving, enjoy your jog,‚Äù I said as I began to pull away.¬†

The car lurched forward, and so did the woman. She grabbed onto my arm, the strength of her grip surprising me. Her eyes, intense, locked onto mine once more, and I could feel her pouring over me, reading me like an old dusty tome.¬†

Within the exact second, she was in the back seat. The car never stopped for me to let her in or for the girls to get out. She had simply replaced the space that they had been occupying only moments before. I glanced in the rearview mirror, catching her eyes once again, a question forming on my lips. The thought was lost when a familiar squeeze met my thigh. Looking to the passenger seat, my partner, David, smiled lovingly at me.¬†

‚ÄúReady to go?‚Äù He asked, his beachy blond waves falling angelically around his shoulders. I glanced behind me at Michelle, the name of the woman replacing whatever useless query that had momentarily plagued me. I nodded, giddily, and returned my eyes to the road ahead. We were traveling North to San Fransico.¬†



I imagine my story will do little to prove my innocence in the minds of many.¬† Much of this will be dismissed as the mad ramblings of a man dying in captivity, making one last attempt to grasp at freedom. And they would be smart to think so. Though my memory has failed me more than once, played with like an Etch-A-Sketch, the truth shaken away and replaced by fantasy, no less real to me, I‚Äôll do my best to tell things exactly as they happened.

I grew up in the 1950s, born the year the Second World War ended. In my youth, my differences were less apparent to both me and those around me. It wasn‚Äôt until junior high that I realized I was not like the other boys, who left their fear of ‚Äòcooties‚Äô from the opposite sex to begin to chase girls through the school halls. I found myself uninterested in women, but mesmerized by the way my friends‚Äô shoulders grew broader under their school uniforms, the way their legs were now covered in thick hair visible in our gym shorts. I kept these thoughts to myself. Growing up in this time, queerness was next to communism and devil worship in the growing list of America‚Äôs enemies, according to McCarthy.¬†

There were trists in my youth, of course. Feverish nights stolen away with some other equally frightened young man. But once the morning came, they were always gone, our brief love stories kept sacred by the dark of night.¬†

I met my wife, Carolyn, in college‚Äîa smart and beautiful young woman from Phoenix. We waited until we had both completed school to get married; her education was important to her sense of independence. She chose to work at a hospital near our first apartment in Santa Monica, rather than settling into a life of homemaking. Although this was becoming increasingly common for young couples, it was her progressive attitude towards the traditional roles of marriage that attracted me to her.¬†

Lilith was born on December 8th, 1963. The moment I became a father, the lusts of my youth seemed to slip away. As I held my daughter for the first time in the hospital, I thought maybe it had truly just been a phase, a working out of testosterone to be left in the past.¬† Two years later, we had Evelyn in May. Those first few years, when the girls were young, I could still convince myself that I loved my wife the way a husband should. Our days were full of childlike wonderment that distracted me from carnal desires I‚Äôd held for my fellow man. But as our daughters grew into adolescence and my wife continued to work later shifts at the hospital, it became increasingly difficult to ignore.

I began cruising Will Rogers‚Äô State Beach on weekend nights when the family was busy with their own extracurriculars. This stretch of beach, specifically between lifeguard stations 17 and 18, was known locally as Ginger Rogers‚Äô Beach, a nod to the popular actress. Gay men and lesbian women had been inhabiting this little slice of Santa Monica coastline since before I was born. There were bathhouses that allowed for more privacy, something I valued deeply in those days. I regarded the men who flirted shamelessly and openly as reckless, dangerous, even.¬† I spoke with European men twice my age, refugees from the Nazi‚Äôs who‚Äôd lived openly here for decades. Yet here I was returning each night to my quiet, closested life in the suburbs. My guilt was compounded. Not only was I betraying my family with my actions, but I was betraying myself each time I got back in my car to return home.¬†

Though there were pockets of polite society where same-sex ‚Äòfriends‚Äô were tolerated for the most part, authorities would still occasionally make an example of someone, keeping the community in a constant state of secrecy and fear. One Sunday morning, I sat at my kitchen table flipping through the paper as my wife poured me coffee. I held the cup to my lips as I read a small header describing a Vice sting in a public restroom of the beach I‚Äôd been frequenting. My hand began to tremble, sending scalding coffee onto the table and my lap.¬†

My wife, more kind than she was dutiful, hurried over with a rag to tamp out any stains from my trousers. Reading the headline herself over my shoulder, she clicked her tongue and shook her head. I braced myself for an incoming rant about how sexual degeneracy was destroying American Christian values. Something I had grown up accustomed to hearing.¬†

But my wife said simply, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt they have anyone better to pick on?‚Äù and went about her morning.

It would have been easy to tell her then. Her thoughtful, empathetic demeanor would swathe me as I confessed my sins, my marital transgressions. But I was a coward. I stopped my trips to Ginger Rogers in fear that my name would appear in the Sunday paper.¬†



Which brings us to the morning I disappeared. Although I could clearly remember my life with David leading up to that moment, the truth is that I had never seen him until he suddenly appeared in my car. His face was familiar, and his smile sent waves of warm love through my body, yet he was a stranger. I still can‚Äôt make sense of what he and Michelle did to my mind, how a simple touch of my wrist could impose new memories, replacing old ones that I‚Äôd held so dear‚Äîthe birth of my children, decades of birthdays and Christmases, all written over in an instant. A part of me blames myself. Perhaps I wanted to forget, to replace the idyllic life I had made for myself with one that would allow me to more freely be who I had tried to run from becoming.¬†

The walls of my cell are decorated with memories of a life I never had. School pictures and drawings from my daughters‚Äô youth, sent to me by my ever compassionate wife, a woman whose love I never doubted nor deserved. A popsicle planter painted with a rainbow of colors holds a dying succulent in the barred window; the bottom reads *‚ÄúHappy Father‚Äôs Day - Lilly 1970‚Äù* in a childish font. I‚Äôve begun to pick up the pieces of my life, true memories of my twenties and thirties crash over me in waves of grief. I write to my daughters, apologizing for abandoning them in such a way, unable or unwilling to explain the more occult parts of the story.¬†

Nevertheless, the story needs to be told. I can shield my daughters from the real-life monsters that lurk in shadows, my singular act of paternal protection at the end of my life. But the world needs to know that there are forces beyond the explanation of modern science. The world needs to know that vampires exist.¬†

I just stumbled upon a really neat little article about Molly Ephraim, and I wanted to share my thoughts with you all. It gives a pretty clear overview of her professional journey, touching on her key roles and some personal details that really help paint a picture of her as an actress and a person. If you're a fan, or just curious about the stars we see on screen, it's a great quick read to get to know more about her. You can check out the full scoop right here: [Molly Ephraim's fascinating journey](https://ubergossip.com/molly-ephraim-height-weight-age-body-statistics-american-celebrities/)

What I really appreciated about the piece was how it presented her career progression. It wasn't just a dry list of facts; you get a sense of her steady work ethic and how she's grown in different projects. For someone who might not know her beyond a specific role, like Mandy in *Last Man Standing*, it really highlights her versatility. I especially liked how it subtly showed that dedication is key in the entertainment world. It makes her feel very down-to-earth and relatable, which I always find refreshing. üåü

But, honestly, that's a small point. The information presented serves as an excellent foundation to truly understand her path. It's concise and to the point, perfect for a quick peek into her life. It doesn't get bogged down, and the pacing is just right for a casual read.

Overall, I think it's a solid piece for anyone looking to learn more about Molly Ephraim.

1n61dgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1n61dgj/what_more_should_i_be_doing/,What more should I be doing?,"25M here, gay. Working two jobs. Still live with family. And I‚Äôm a pretty lonely person. Growing up I had to rely on myself. As a young adult, I do enjoy taking myself out to bars, stores, coffee shops etc. But my personal social circle is very low outside of family. I struggle with generalized anxiety, which can give me depressive symptoms when it peaks or lonely waves hit. I just want close friends & especially a partner to spend my life with. Apps suck with the gay community for any sort of platonic or romantic connection. I had 3 very close friends in college I had to step away from in 2021 due to them treating me wrong, and villainizing me when I stood up for myself. I had a boyfriend for 7 months in 2024, but I chose to leave because I felt I was no longer a priority, and he didn‚Äôt reciprocate the effort I put in. A lot of my disappointment about being lonely is the fact I put so much faith in other people and hope to be treated the same way I treat them, but then it ultimately falls through. I take myself out but have yet to find true connections or people who actually want to message me often or see me. So far I‚Äôve been the only one initiating convos or invites to go out with acquaintances but they‚Äôre either busy or I‚Äôm ghosted. I was recently ghosted after 2 weeks of talking with a potential romantic interest. I only have 1 friend who I met at my current job. My last job, I tried to make out-of-work connections with coworkers and they were never interested. 

I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I‚Äôve put so much growth into my mental health and emotional intelligence the last few years, I‚Äôve been working on my physical health since March this year(Down 30lbs!). I just am so tired of chasing others, so tired of being ghosted, of not being the first option, of giving people grace. I just crave human intimacy and companionship so bad that it hurts. I believe in things happening for a reason, that the universe has its plans for me; But how much longer must I wait? I am grateful for the connections I do have and the skills I‚Äôve learned, but I can still appreciate having 1 friend & great family while also craving for more.",1,1756762224.0,lonely,0,1.0,False
1n61c88,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1n61c88/the_last_prophet_part2/,The last prophet (Part2),"The rage inside me burned until my eyes stung. How could this thing call itself God? I thought God was supposed to be loving, merciful; not this Old Testament tyrant, breathing brimstone and fire. Her confessions weren‚Äôt drawing me closer; they were driving me further away.

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I felt her inside me, trying to smother the fury that had been festering since Lauren‚Äôs death, and the intrusion made it worse. Maybe she was God. Or maybe she was just a parasite wearing the universe as camouflage. Either way, I felt her burrowing into my mind, rooting around like she owned it.

I didn‚Äôt even bother to grab my notes. I just stormed out of the room, only to walk right into her, standing in the hall with that same smug smile plastered across her borrowed face.

‚ÄúLook, Ben,‚Äù she whispered gently, as though nothing had happened, ‚ÄúI get it. I really do. But I‚Äôll see you Monday morning. Then we can start for real. Until then‚Ä¶ just think on it, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúMONDAY?‚Äù I roared, inches from her face, or mask, or whatever this form was. ‚ÄúYou will never see me again. I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm telling Chief I quit. I don‚Äôt need the money, and I‚Äôm not about to help some god who thinks they can play executioner and call it ‚Äòthe greater good.‚Äô‚Äù

She tilted her head, unfazed. ‚ÄúYeah, I know. Chief Carter knows too. I told him you‚Äôd storm out, I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd quit, but I was prepared for this. Tell him whatever you want. I‚Äôll see you Monday.‚Äù

And then she was gone. Just gone.

All that remained was my fury, a wildfire eating through my chest. I marched straight into Chief Carter‚Äôs office without knocking.

‚ÄúHey, Ben, give me just a second, okay?‚Äù Carter muttered, eyes glued to the paperwork stacked across his massive oak desk.

‚ÄúNo need, Chief,‚Äù I said flatly. ‚ÄúI just wanted you to know I‚Äôm done. I quit. If this is God, then I don‚Äôt want to be part of any world she runs.‚Äù

He finally looked up, let out a long, weary sigh. ‚ÄúI know, Ben. She told us. Said you‚Äôd be back, though. Monday morning, like always.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait up, Chief. You know this has been a long time coming. After the last exorcism, I already had one foot out the door. But this?‚Äù I shook my head. ‚ÄúThis is too much.‚Äù

The exorcism still haunted me. Three days spent talking to a bright, kind young woman who should have been anywhere else but strapped to a bed. I‚Äôd diagnosed her with dissociative identity disorder, begged them to treat her like a patient, but the scholars ignored me. They said the signs of ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù were too clear. I watched them starve her over two brutal months while I took her vitals and pretended it was medicine. She died in restraints, dehydrated, wasted, broken. Her screams still woke me some nights.

I carried that guilt like lead in my chest. I had almost quit then. But Carter had reminded me that on paper I didn‚Äôt exist. Sixteen years without a r√©sum√© doesn‚Äôt get you another job. That‚Äôs the curse of working for a ghost agency, there‚Äôs nowhere else to go.

‚ÄúI get it, Ben,‚Äù Carter said softly, ‚Äúbut you know we need you. And whether you admit it or not, you need the agency too. Just get some rest. Take the weekend. Call me if you really decide not to come back. The world kind of depends on it.‚Äù

That night in bed, I thought of Lauren. Of everything that might have been if she hadn‚Äôt been taken. We could have gone another way down the street. Shopped another day. Anything. Instead of moving on, I had buried myself in work, in school, in the one thing that numbed me: understanding the human mind. But I never let anyone else in. I never wanted anyone else. Lauren had been enough‚Äîmore than enough.

And now this so-called God dared to call me Benny, the name only Lauren had ever used. She knew what it would do to me. She knew it would soften me, make me listen, make me doubt my rage.

I drifted into sleep.

And suddenly, I was seventeen again. Lauren‚Äôs hand in mine, her long dark hair brushing my arm as we window-shopped for back-to-school clothes. She was pointing at a dress she‚Äôd never get to wear.

Then the fight. The shouting. The flash of a gun.

But this time, when it fell, the bullet never came. The men were pulled apart, the weapon confiscated. Lauren clung to me, trembling, grateful. Alive.

The dream rushed forward. Graduation. Wedding. Our first child. Milestones unfurled one after another, life as it should have been. Her hand gripping mine through childbirth, her laugh filling our first home, her tears at funerals, her warmth through every storm. A whole lifetime spun out, vivid and complete. Until I lay in a hospital bed, old and wrinkled, with Lauren still by my side, whispering through tears:

‚ÄúYou need to make things right with God, Benny. I‚Äôm sorry it had to be this way. But God needs you now. I‚Äôve had you long enough.‚Äù

The alarm dragged me back to reality. I could still feel her breath on my cheek.

‚ÄúThis must be her,‚Äù I thought bitterly. She had used Lauren against me. If she thought that would make me help, she was wrong.

‚ÄúYou sure about that, Ben?‚Äù

I jerked upright. She was standing at the foot of my bed.

‚ÄúWhat if you could have that every night?‚Äù she said gently. ‚ÄúSpend your days in this broken world, but every night, I can give you Lauren back. The life you should have had. Every moment. Every memory. Yours.‚Äù

Her smile was sincere‚Äîbut behind it I saw something hungrier, sharper.

‚ÄúI knew it,‚Äù I spat. ‚ÄúYou think you can bribe me with dreams? Make me forget you took her from me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat dream, Ben?‚Äù she asked, feigning innocence.

‚ÄúYou know which one.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Ben,‚Äù she sighed, ‚Äúthat wasn‚Äôt a dream. It was real. Just as real as this room. Every child, every laugh, every tear. Not fantasy. Reality, just‚Ä¶ another thread of it.‚Äù

My heart froze. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying you can bring her back?‚Äù

‚ÄúI could,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut not here. That path‚Äôs gone. Too much paperwork.‚Äù Her smile tilted. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs another option. The multiverse, Ben. Not comic book fiction, the real deal. Every choice creates a world, and in most, she lived. I can send you there. Every night. You could have it all; the good, the bad, the everything.‚Äù

My breath caught, but I forced myself to shake my head. ‚ÄúNo. You want my help, find another therapist. I‚Äôm done.‚Äù

I dragged myself downstairs for coffee, only to find her already sitting at my dining table, steaming mug in hand, a fresh pot waiting for me.

‚ÄúYou know, Ben,‚Äù she said, her voice cooler now, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting tired of your attitude. Things would be easier if you just accepted it. But if you push me, I will make you help.‚Äù

The air turned glacial. Shivers climbed my spine.

‚ÄúFree will is hard to override,‚Äù she said, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúBut not impossible. I gave it to you. I can take it back.‚Äù

Her words pressed into me like iron. My body stiffened, my thoughts bent under her weight. My will dissolved into hers. She was inside me, around me, in every nerve, every impulse, steering me toward the door. My hand gripped the car handle without me willing it.

‚ÄúIs this better?‚Äù her voice filled me from within. ‚ÄúDoes it feel holy now?‚Äù

‚ÄúNO. STOP!‚Äù I roared, forcing the word past lips that didn‚Äôt want to move.

She released me instantly. My body sagged. I was shaking, cold to the bone.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever do that again,‚Äù I rasped.

Her face softened, almost maternal again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Ben. Truly. I don‚Äôt like doing things that way. I‚Äôd rather just sit, talk, work with you. But if you test me‚Ä¶ I will make you help. Do you understand?‚Äù

I did. Whether she was God or something else, I didn‚Äôt know. But in that moment I knew this: I would help her.

If only to make sure she never controlled me like that again.",1,1756762145.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1n61bbp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n61bbp,Welcome Back to the Girl Dish of the Month Event üéâ,"Our cooking of August 2025 has come to a close. There is some wonderful dishes here. The Moddesses have voted on many nominees. We also had again a ton of options, but the voting has come to a close and winners have been decided for this month. As all the members know we decide among 6 categories plus the Girl Dish of Month Winner. So lets go in order of the meals of the day.

Starting with Girl Breakfast of the Month we have an [Egg Hash Chorizo Dish](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaansbiansCooking/comments/1mzg715/chorizo_and_potato_hash/?share_id=WD_PBqTRkivKLchwpSljo&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1). Our winner of the Breakfast of the month is u/[whatgradeareyouin](/user/whatgradeareyouin/) . They made Hashbrowns with chorizo and put sunny side-up eggs on top. It looks like a great breakfast with a spicy kick. ThIS dish earned our member their title. Thank you for this post. 

Next is our Girl Snacks Winner of the month u/[Samantha\_Aran](/user/Samantha_Aran/) who added her [Monster](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaansbiansCooking/comments/1mn3z7a/girl_dinner_but_i_cant_cook/) ultra strawberry dreams. Although not the healthiest of snacks, I'm sure it resonates with the Transbian sub as a great drink snack. The Moddesses thought this was a cute post as a snack just because of it being a stereotypical drink.I hope you overcome not cooking, but this was great too. Thank you for your post. 

We have Girl Dinner of the month for our middle category. This is always our biggest group of nominees . The winner among the nominees of Girl Dinner of the month is u/[Velvet\_Aizen](/user/Velvet_Aizen/) who showed us their [\*Steak in garlic/rosmary butter, patata puree and tendercooked and caramelosed onions <3\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaansbiansCooking/comments/1n0rct4/steak_in_garlicrosmary_butter_patata_puree_and/) Which looks delicious. There is multiple dishes that were also possibilities but they rose to the top. Thank you for posting this great Dinner dish. 

After Dinner we have Dessert, very fitting. For Girl dessert of the month we saw many desserts that great as well. Some maybe gifts others just a casual treat, but we have voted on u/[Randomcluelessperson](/user/Randomcluelessperson/) 's [Vegan Strawberry Rhubarb pie](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaansbiansCooking/comments/1mhib5p/all_the_girls_like_my_pie/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to share with their friend. This dish looks great. I personally love the look of it seeing the strawberries encased in it. Thank you for posting this dish. 

Next we Have Two categories again before showing our Girl Dish Winner of the month. These two categories are Culinary artist and Ingredients posting. 

The culinary artist winner for the month of August 2025 is u/[alexmlb3598](/user/alexmlb3598/) who created their [Salmon Chow Mein](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaansbiansCooking/comments/1mswj3h/salmon_chow_mein/?share_id=EJN1GLMXjs3F4sK64MovB&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1). This Asian dish with the recipe was picked because of how well it was presented to us. Many of the nominee's dishes has this feeling of picture perfect but we voted on this dish. They gave an amazing close up of this glimmering dish. It looks fantastic. Thank you for posting. Plus the recipe.

For the winner of ingredients posting we have u/[BecaBakes](/user/BecaBakes/) [""Recent nonsense""](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaansbiansCooking/comments/1mns1if/recent_nonsense/?share_id=j05C_PJS7gQOqPgE0iGwo&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1). This post was mysterious to us plus it was the only post of this month as an Ingredients posting post. From the context of the post it seems to be Flour, spices/Broth, and breadcrumbs for what it looks like chicken. They fry the chicken in the next picture. This was an interesting and chaoitc post but we thank you for contributing to the sub. You are the true Winner of Ingredients posting this month.

Now the Winner of Girl Dish of the Month is u/[Existing\_Constant\_21](/user/Existing_Constant_21/) and their [Caramel Iced Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaansbiansCooking/comments/1mxz3rg/caramel_iced_coffee/) plus their potato wedges and chicken vegetable post. This Caramel Iced Coffee post was a favorite by our founder and other Moddesses. It looked way too good to pass up nominating it.  Their [Dinner Time ](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaansbiansCooking/comments/1mtqury/dinner_time/)post looked great too as a healthy dinner and well prepared to be shared. Thank you for your post. Congratulations to our winners. 

As before we will show our nominees of the categories in the comments. They deserve all the love as well. 

Thank you for attending another Girl dish of the month event.

1n619qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArrowVDisscussions/comments/1n619qo/review_28_legends_of_tomorrow_season_3/,Review 28: Legends of Tomorrow Season 3,"Legends Season 3 premiered on October 10th, 2017 on The CW. When we last left the Legends, they attempted to time travel with two versions of themselves. This had a larger impact on time than they thought. Due to this blunder, anachronisms (including objects and people) have popped up along the timeline. Rip Hunter's Time Bureau, a replacement for the Time Masters, forces the Legends to disband and resume normal lives. They are forced back into action as deputized members of the Time Bureau, however, unaware that Rip is planning to use their often-destructive tendencies for a threat bigger than the anachronisms. Yeah, leave it to those idiots to screw up timeline with their blunders. Over the course of this season, the Legends deal with Mallus, and Earth-X versions of their friends who lead that earth‚Äôs Nazi‚Äôs (more on that later) to name a few examples.

In the season three premiere ‚ÄúAruba-Con‚Äù, In an altered Los Angeles the Legends encounter Rip, who reveals that he has created a Time Bureau to replace the Time Masters' Council. Bureau agents fix anachronisms, and Rip disbands the Legends. Six months later they are living normal lives, nostalgic for their previous adventures. In Aruba, Mick captures Julius Caesar, informs the other Legends, and returns to the bureau. After delivering the wrong man and being dismissed by Rip, the Legends steal the Waverider and capture the real Caesar. When Rip demands that they deliver Caesar to the bureau and let them fix the anachronism, the Legends return Caesar to 49 BC themselves. During the return, Caesar steals Nate's history book and uses this knowledge to conquer the world. The bureau arrives, seizing control of the operation. Agent Ava Sharpe is captured during an excursion to retrieve the book, forcing Rip to allow the Legends to fix the anachronism; he later tells Sharpe that they could be useful in neutralizing Mallus. Amaya, with significantly-improved powers, attacks a group of poachers in 1942 Zambesi.

In ‚ÄúFreakshow‚Äù, Amaya learns about Mari's vigilantism and leaves Nate. The Legends head six months later to an anachronism in an 1870 Wisconsin circus led by P.T. Barnum, who has captured an extinct sabertooth tiger. Ray's shrinking device malfunctions, leading to the enlargement and escape of the tiger. Sara visits Amaya and convinces her to return, to Nate's displeasure. While Nate, Ray, and Jax visit an inn, Amaya and Sara shrink and capture the tiger. Drunk and depressed about his relationship with Amaya, Nate tells Barnum about their powers. Intending to use them for his shows, Barnum captures Ray and Jax. When Nate tells the Legends about his actions, Amaya reveals why she broke up with him in 2017.[a] While Sara engages with Sharpe on the Waverider, the Legends attack the circus and rescue their teammates (removing the anachronism). Nate reconciles with Amaya, who tells the Legends that she has begun to lose control of her animal powers; her behavior has become psychopathic. Rip tells the Legends about Mallus, an ancient archenemy of the Time Masters; he believes that the outlying anachronisms are Mallus' work. They disregard his warning. A follower of Mallus summons Kuasa, Mari's sister.

In ‚ÄúZari‚Äù, In 2042 Seattle, bureau agent Gary Green discovers Kuasa (who now can control water) while pursuing hacktivist Zari and sends a distress signal. The Legends receive it and find Seattle under martial law imposed by A.R.G.U.S., which is hunting down metahumans. They find Zari, who demands help rescuing her brother from prison in exchange for learning about her powers. Stein and Nate seek a solution, and Nate synthesizes a Zambesi hallucinogen. Zari uses it to have a vision of an ancestor who advises her to trust her increasing strength. Jax initiates an unplanned prison break; Zari retrieves her brother's amulet (indicating his murder by A.R.G.U.S.) and abandons the team. Ray pursues her to a campsite where her family is to meet. Kuasa attacks the two while Sharpe pursues the Waverider in the timestream. The Legends arrive and Amaya (now in control of her powers) defeats Kuasa, who vanishes using a mystical item; this implies that she is a descendant of hers. Sharpe warns Sara that if the Legends are arrested, they would be banished to the ""dawn of time"". Amaya decides to stay, and recruits Zari to the team. In 1988, a young Ray encounters an unknown creature.

In ‚ÄúPhone Home‚Äù, Ray suddenly disappears from the Waverider, and Gideon reveals that he died around Halloween in 1988. The Legends travel to 1988, when Ray reappears and finds that his younger self has adopted a baby Dominator. NSA agents take the baby Dominator, leading Ray, young Ray, and Zari to rescue it while Sara, Nate, and Amaya learn that the Dominator's mother has returned to retrieve her child. The mother (who killed young Ray) traps Sara in a web. Sara escapes, and the baby uses mind control to distract the agents. The Legends return it to its mother, who leaves in peace. When young Ray is bullied on Halloween, the Legends defend him. Jax and Mick learn that Stein is anxious to be present for the birth of his grandchild and help him, ""borrowing"" the Waverider. Jax later asks Ray to help him find a way to take Stein's Firestorm powers so he can leave the Legends.

In ‚ÄúReturn of The Mack‚Äù, Nate discovers a pattern in the anachronisms, with two outliers: Kuasa's attack, and a suspected vampire attack in Victorian London. The Legends meet Rip, who is investigating a conspiracy involving Mallus. They discover their enemy Damien Darhk's body, which apparently fell through a temporal rift into this time period. Zari encounters Nora Darhk, a follower of Mallus who steals her amulet while working with a Victorian occult society. Rip traps the Legends on the Waverider for protection before attending Damien's resurrection, which Nora achieves with the amulet. Damien and Nora escape after killing several bureau agents led by Rip. Sara reports Rip's action to the bureau, and he is arrested for re-legitimizing the Legends. Rip warns Sara about Mallus' importance. Jax has Ray try to sever his psychic connection with Stein as a precursor to breaking their physical link as Firestorm, but experiences short-term memory loss. Stein finds out, and decides to help them.

In ‚ÄúHelen Hunt‚Äù, Jax and Martin swap bodies after their attempt to transfer Firestorm to Jax fails. The Legends track an anachronism to 1937 Hollywood: Helen of Troy. Attempting to extract Helen at a party, the team encounters Damien, Nora, and Kuasa; Damien tells Sara that he will spare their lives if they stop time-traveling. Stein meets Hedy Lamarr, and the other male Legends fight over Helen. The female Legends confront Helen privately. After she refuses to return to Troy because men die over her, Helen is captured by the female Legends. Stein learns that Lamarr has become a switchboard operator; because she does not invent frequency-hopping spread spectrum, the Waverider breaks down. The Legends go to Lamarr's workplace, resulting in a confrontation with Damien's forces. Lamarr tells Jax and Stein to merge, which allows them to return to their original bodies. Nora tries to drain Sara's soul but is driven off by Firestorm, leaving Sara comatose. Damien, Nora and Kuasa retreat. A sympathetic Zari brings Helen to Themyscira, instead of Troy.

In ‚ÄúWelcome to The Jungle‚Äù, With Sara in a coma, the Legends investigate creature attacks during the Vietnam War. Zari, Ray, and Amaya, posing as journalists, meet a woman who shows them the creature, who turns out to be a time-displaced Gorilla Grodd. Nate and Mick are captured by a squad led by Mick's father, Dick Rory. On the Waverider, Stein discusses separating Firestorm with Isaac Newton. Jax walks in on their discussion and learns that Firestorm can be separated, but it would depower Jax. The anachronism increases in intensity, revealing Grodd's plan to wipe out humanity by killing President Johnson and starting World War III. Jax saves Johnson from a minefield. After failing to capture Grodd, Amaya uses her powers to negotiate with him but is thwarted when Dick's squad attacks. Grodd decides to steal the Waverider and erase humanity from the timeline. His attempt fails, and he apparently falls to his death. In Grodd's compound, Mick stops his father from massacring Grodd's prisoners and comes to terms with their relationship. The team returns to the ship as Sara awakens. In 2017, Grodd is approached by Damien.

In the finale of ‚ÄúCrisis on Earth-X‚Äù, On Earth-X, Stein activates the temporal gateway's portal before his death. Jax bonds with Stein to get him through the portal with Barry, Oliver, Sara, Alex, Ray Terrill, and Leo Snart (Leonard Snart's Earth-X doppelg√§nger). Members of the teams face off against Earth-X Metallo, while Felicity and Kara are cornered by Dark Arrow before Oliver saves them. Jax is affected by Stein's wounds, since Stein severs their link. Dark Arrow tries to negotiate for Kara, but Oliver refuses and the team battles Dark Arrow's forces. Caitlin, Amaya, and Zari infiltrate the Nazi timeship Wellenreiter to disable its shields so Harry and Cisco can destroy it with the Waverider. Barry defeats Thawne but allows him to escape, resuming their feud. Supergirl battles Overgirl, flying her into space to detonate away from Earth. Oliver kills Dark Arrow. Terrill returns to Earth-X, but Leo chooses to stay and joins the Legends. The team has a funeral for Stein. The Legends, Kara, and Alex return to their own lives. Barry and Iris are married by John Diggle, who also marries Oliver and Felicity.

In ‚ÄúBeebo The God of War‚Äù, The team tracks down another anachronism: a young Martin Stein, displaced in the time of the Vikings. Martin was buying a talking Beebo toy for his daughter when he was displaced, causing the Vikings to believe that Beebo is the god of war. Damien, disguised as Odin, is exposed by the Legends. Sara chases Damien, but ends up in Mallus's dimension before being pulled back to the real world by Ava. Jax tries to tell young Stein about his future self's death; Stein had already deduced it and decides not to learn the details of his death, however, accepting his fate and resolving to dedicate his remaining years to his loved ones. With the present Stein dead and his Firestorm powers gone, Jax leaves the team after an impromptu Christmas celebration. After saying goodbye to him Sara is greeted by John Constantine, who says that he needs the Legends' help with a demon who knows her name and is controlling a little girl.

In ‚ÄúDaddy Dahrkest‚Äù, Constantine tells the Legends about the demon Mallus (whom Sara encountered), who is tormenting Damien's daughter Nora in an insane asylum in 2017. Constantine, Sara, and Leo go to meet her, but are sent to 1969 by Mallus. They begin looking for ingredients for a spell to return, and Sara and Constantine bond. In the present, Ray and Zari look for the missing trio in the asylum before taking Nora out for coffee; Mallus possesses Nora, and attacks Ray and Zari. Sara re-enters Mallus' realm in 1969, where she finds a frightened Nora and encourages her to fight Mallus. In the present, Nora breaks free of Mallus; when Damien shows up, Nora leaves with him. Constantine uses a spell to bring himself, Sara, and Leo back to the present before leaving the team with Leo. During the encounter with Mallus, Zari discovers that the demon was damaged and frightened by the totem that empowers her and the team begins looking for the remaining Zambesi totems. Ava tells the Legends that Rip Hunter escaped.

In ‚ÄúHere I Go Again‚Äù, Zari tries to repair the Waverider, but is covered in goo and apparently activates a program that blows up the ship before re-experiencing events from earlier that day. The day keeps repeating, with Zari learning secrets about the team (such as Mick's writing ability). The Legends learn that Gary caused the repetition. Mick destroys Gary's device, but Gary tells them that the repetition was the only thing saving them from death. When the ship is next set to explode, Zari seals herself in the study and uses her powers to contain the blast. She reappears in an empty Waverider, where she encounters Gideon's human form; she reassures her that she is alive in the medical bay, and he transported Zari to her program to convince her to stay with the Legends. Zari tells Sara that she was researching historical loopholes to see if she could save her brother, and Sara tells her that it might be possible. In Yunnan, the recently-escaped Rip Hunter tracks down Wally West.

In ‚ÄúThe Curse of The Earth Totem‚Äù, The team reviews the list of totems and decides to find the Fire Totem first, but Damien retrieves it. Sara dates Ava. While she is away, the team takes the Waverider to the 1700s Bahamas to find the Earth Totem. They encounter a pirate crew led by Edward Teach which includes Damien, who steals Amaya's Anansi Totem. After learning about the team's trouble, Sara leaves her date with Ava to help them. The Waverider is attacked by cannonballs and boarded by Blackbeard and his crew, but Ava helps Sara fight them off. During the fight, Ray shoots Nora with a nanite gun to save Amaya. Most of the team escapes, taking the Earth Totem; Ray, meeting Nora as a child, is wracked by guilt and offers to cure her in exchange for the Anansi Totem. Damien accepts, but the Darhks capture Ray after Nora is cured. Rip and Wally bond, getting drunk together. The following morning, Rip tells Wally that the world needs him and an outcast like him would suit the Legends.

In ‚ÄúNo Country for Old Dads‚Äù, Damien tells Nora and Ray to travel to 1962 East Berlin to retrieve information about cold fusion to fix the Fire Totem. Rip brings Wally to the Legends, and they try to work out their next move. Nora corrupts the Anansi Totem and the Legends learn that the Darhks are creating anachronisms to weaken Mallus' cage, freeing him. Ray blasts a hole in the Berlin Wall when cornered by Nora, causing another anachronism and allowing the Legends to find him. Wally rescues Ray and takes the Fire Totem. Director Bennett is murdered by Grodd, making Ava senior officer of the Time Bureau and allowing Rip to return. Wally intends to go with Rip and Ava, but Sara convinces him to stay with the Legends and Rip congratulates him. Rip tells Gideon to delete Ava's file before he leaves, saying that Sara must never know Ava's secret. Mallus regains control of Nora behind Damien's back.

In ‚ÄúAmazing Grace‚Äù, Wally moves into the Waverider and annoys everyone with his super-speed. The team soon finds differences on the ship, such as Nate's hair, Mick's rat's name, and Zari's game. Tracking the anachronism, they learn that mass panic was caused in Memphis, Tennessee in 1954 during a performance by Elvis Presley. Presley's guitar contains the final totem (the Death Totem) which, unlike the other five totems, was used by Mallus. Presley admits he might quit music after the death of his brother. The team brings the guitar back to the Waverider, but begins seeing a ghostly presence. They secure the Death Totem, and convince Elvis to continue pursuing music. Amaya plays Nate music from Zambesi, making the box containing the Death Totem shake.

In ‚ÄúNecromancing The Stone‚Äù, Sara is enticed to open the box and wear the Death Totem; her body again falls under Mallus' control, and her mind is trapped in the demon's realm. Ava and Gary track down Constantine for help. The Legends unsuccessfully try to stop Mallus-Sara. In Mallus' domain, Sara sees visions of what made her the woman she is as Nora tries to convince her to join Mallus. Learning that Sara is using the Death Totem, Constantine tries to enter Mallus' realm to take her place; Mallus blocks him. Amaya convinces Mick to wield the Fire Totem, which stuns Mallus-Sara. Ava rips off the Death Totem, tearfully tries to get Sara to fight back and places her hand on her chest (which Sara feels), convincing her to reject Nora's offer and reclaim her body. Fearing that she might hurt Ava, Sara breaks up with her to protect her.

In ‚ÄúI, Ava‚Äù, Sara considers leaving the team after her breakup with Ava, but learns from Gary that Ava has not been to work in several days. Sara, Ray, and Gary travel to Ava's home and discover that Ava's ""parents"" are paid actors. The three travel to 2213, where they learn that Ava is a clone mass-produced by a conglomerate. Apprehended by Ava clones, they are saved by the original Ava (who did not know she was a clone; her memory was wiped by the Time Bureau). Zari teaches Mick to use the Fire Totem. Amaya (in a temporary truce with Kuasa) reclaims her totem, but Nate is captured by Damien. Damien says that he misses Nora and fake-tortures Nate, but is caught by Nora. Amaya, Wally, and Kuasa rescue Nate and confront Nora, but Nora rips the Water Totem out of Kuasa and kills her. Driven by grief and guilt, Amaya returns to 1992 Zambesi to change her family's fate. Ava and Sara realize that Rip deleted Ava's file from the Bureau, and decide to find out why.

In ‚ÄúGuest Starring John Noble‚Äù, The Legends stop Gorilla Grodd from killing future president Barack Obama in the 1980s, preventing another anachronism and delaying Mallus' release. Damien realizes that Nora will be killed when Mallus is released, and allies himself with the Legends. By getting actor John Noble to impersonate Mallus' voice, the team tricks Nora into the Waverider and contains her. Ava asks Rip if he knows that she was a clone; Rip says that she is the 12th Ava clone he has recruited because she is a talented agent. Amaya returns to 1992 Zambesi to change history and secure her family's future. Nate, instead of trying to convince her to return, helps her. Sara decides to allow this, causing the final anachronism that will free Mallus after concluding that the only way to stop the demon is to release him. She gives Damien the Death Totem, and the rest of the team wields their individual totems. Damien realizes that Nora is still alive in Mallus and releases Grodd to destroy Zambesi, preventing Mallus' release. Nate subdues Grodd with the Earth Totem, allowing Mallus to break out of his prison and kill Nora.

In the season 3 finale, ‚ÄúThe Good, The Bad, and The Cuddly‚Äù, Mallus demands that the Legends hand over the six totems. Rip sacrifices himself to allow the team to flee to the town of Salvation in the Old West. An army of Romans, Vikings, and pirates arrives, threatening to destroy the town unless the Legends surrender the totems. Ray and Damien travel to when Mallus is released; Damien frees Nora from Mallus' hold, causing him to kill Damien instead of Nora. In the Old West, the Legends ally with Jonah Hex, Helen of Troy, Jax, Nora, and an alternate Kuasa, and save the town from the army. Mallus arrives for the totems. Sara, Mick, Amaya, Nate, Zari, and Wally combine the totems' energies to create the ultimate warrior: a large Beebo, who kills Mallus. Nora is arrested by the Time Bureau, but Ray helps her escape. Amaya returns to Zambesi, but keeps her memories. The Legends' vacation in 2018 Aruba is interrupted when Constantine arrives, revealing that Mallus is not the only demon who escaped.

Casting: Much of the usual suspects return this year. Victor Garber leaves the show as a regular, his character of Marty Stein is killed in COEX part 4. Joining the show this season is Keiynan Lonsdale as Wally West/Kid Flash from The Flash, Jess Macallen as Ava Sharpe, and Tala Ashe as Zari Tomaz. Arthur Darvill makes his last appearance on the show until a guest appearance in Season 7 as does Wentworth Miller, who incidentally plays Earth-X Snart in COEX. Matt Ryan makes his first LOT appearance this year and continues through season 7. The cast is in top form this year and works well. John Noble voices Mallus. 5/5

Writing: Phil Klemmer delivers the goods this year as head Showrunner, he‚Äôs joined by writer Chris Fedak as a Co-Showrunner. My favorite episodes are Aruba-Con, Helen Hunt, COEX part 4, Amazing Grace, Welcome to The Jungle, I Ava, Guest Starring John Noble, and The Good, The Bad, and The Cuddly to name a few. Funny thing about Guest Starring John Noble, there‚Äôs a Joke where they get the actor to impersonate Mallus (whom he already voices in real life). LOT is starting to get more meta this season. 5/5

Special Effects: Visually The show looks great, the fights are fun. The Characters look convincing. Mallus is imposing. 5/5

Sound effects and Music: The Sound and Music Departments continue to deliver. Neely‚Äôs music still kicks ass, COEX blends the themes of the different shows in the Arrowverse to showcase our heroes. 5/5.

Replay and Entertainment Value: I‚Äôd day this is one of the best seasons of LOT. I‚Äôd recommend and rewatch. 5/5

Season Score: 25/25
Final Total: 33/33

Final Thoughts: Fun season this year, as I said one of the best. The Legends are still acting the fools and fuck things up in their attempt to get rid of anachronisms. Much of it to comedic effect, other times plain stupidity. The stupidity shows up more as the series progresses. Mallus is a great villain as is Gorilla Grodd. I like how Themyscira is shown in Helen Hunt. The chemistry between Sara and Ava is amazing to see this season. Ava‚Äôs backstory is tragic, she never knew she was a clone. Another favorite moment this season is Supergirl fighting her Earth-X counterpart and Oliver Queen doing the same with Dark Arrow. My next review will be either Supergirl Season 4 or Flash Season 5. When we come back for LOT Season 4, will it be as good or better than this one? Stay tuned.",3,1756761974.0,ArrowVDisscussions,2,1.0,False

It was a women write challenge and I took them up on it.

How My Mother Became Both My Biggest Wound and My Greatest Inspiration.

https://preview.redd.it/3ubijmh4fmmf1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e1c0bc7ed09079de18ed04123cfcd21d915cbc8

""Breast Cancer Survivor ‚Ä¢ Mother ‚Ä¢ Trailblazer‚Äù

For everyone, there‚Äôs a woman who inspires you. People usually name their mother, grandmother, sister, or some famous activist who paved the way. And I‚Äôll admit, my pick comes with a twist. My inspiration is my mom. Yes, the same woman who caused a good chunk of my childhood trauma left scars that fed my anxiety, my binge eating, and my addictions. And yet ‚Äî she‚Äôs also the woman who taught me what grit looks like, what survival looks like, what unapologetic worth looks like.

See? I told you this wasn‚Äôt going to be the usual ‚Äúlet‚Äôs light a candle for mom‚Äù piece. The truth is messy, and the mother wound is a bitch to heal. But here I am, trying.

# Childhood: The Absence That Shaped Me

Let‚Äôs get it straight. My mom wasn‚Äôt around much when I was little. She left me with my great-grandmother so she could chase her career in law enforcement. Work came first, not family. Even when she got married, it was the same, her job over everything and everyone. At the time, that abandonment cracked me open in ways I‚Äôm still unpacking as an adult. Loneliness, people-pleasing, codependency ‚Äî they all took root in that space where her presence should‚Äôve been.

As a child, I hated it. I wanted someone to look me in the eye and say, ‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù I wanted hugs and soft words. Instead, I got silence and duty. And honestly, it wrecked me for a long time, but I could never put a name to the emotions I felt. A sense of abandonment and childhood emotional neglect trauma were the words I was looking for.

But here‚Äôs the plot twist: those same absences and mistakes gave me a front-row seat to learning what¬†*not*¬†to do. And sometimes, the best teachers are the ones who failed you.

# Who She Really Is

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the other side of this woman.

She‚Äôs not just my mom. She‚Äôs a survivor. A warrior in a 5-foot frame who has lived more lives than most people twice her size.

She was in the army for four years. She became a firefighter and EMT ‚Äî the¬†*first African American female state trooper*¬†in Panama City, Florida. Do you know what kind of backbone it takes to walk into burning buildings, carry strangers out, and then go home like it‚Äôs just Tuesday? That‚Äôs her.

She‚Äôs also a cancer survivor. Breast cancer, to be exact. She stared down mortality and decided she wasn‚Äôt done yet. That stubbornness to live is stitched into her DNA.

On paper, she looks like a superhero. And in real life? Well, she‚Äôs still a complicated human. Direct to the point of cutting, low on empathy, allergic to emotional vulnerability. Communication? Let‚Äôs just say we both major in misfires. But underneath it all, she‚Äôs got this crazy selflessness. She‚Äôll give you the shirt off her back, no questions asked.

# The Paradox of Love and Hurt

Here‚Äôs the wildest thing: I admire her. I mean, how could I not? This woman has walked through fire ‚Äî literally ‚Äî and still stands. She doesn‚Äôt bend when the world tries to break her. She knows what she wants, goes for it, and never lets anyone tell her she can‚Äôt. And most important: she knows her worth.

That last part hits me the hardest.

Because I‚Äôve spent years trying to build that for myself. Healing from her choices, rewriting the story she left in me, untangling the pain of being invisible as a kid. My binge eating, my addictions, my anxiety ‚Äî they all trace back to those early years of not being seen. And yet, the very woman who caused that wound also modeled the antidote: worth, determination, self-belief.

Do you see the paradox? The woman who hurt me the most is the woman who inspires me the most.

It‚Äôs confusing. It‚Äôs painful. And it‚Äôs oddly beautiful.

# What I‚Äôve Learned From Her

Here‚Äôs the part that shows that yes, trauma survivors do heal, grow, and move forward in life:

* I wish she‚Äôd show emotions. Cry once in a while, hug me without it being awkward, say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you‚Äù without it sounding like a business memo.
* But you know what? Not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea comes with sugar. Some are just black coffee: bitter, bold, keeps you awake whether you like it or not. That‚Äôs her. And she‚Äôs taught me to drink it anyway.
* Her strength isn‚Äôt soft, it‚Äôs steel. Her love isn‚Äôt flowery, it‚Äôs practical. And her presence in my adulthood, even after all the absence in my childhood, matters more than I admit sometimes.

What I‚Äôve learned is that inspiration doesn‚Äôt always come wrapped in a bow. Sometimes it comes in raw, jagged edges. Sometimes it‚Äôs the very thing that forced you to grow, that pushed you into healing, that demanded you learn resilience. Most importantly, learn how to forgive and create new memories that replace the old ones

# Healing the Mother Wound

Writing this, I feel the sting. The mother wound doesn‚Äôt just vanish because you name it. It‚Äôs stubborn, it lingers, it hides in the corners of relationships and self-doubt. But this article challenge by Women Write Publication, gave me a voice to express my truth.¬†This is my way of handing her back some light. A way of saying: yes, you hurt me. Yes, you weren‚Äôt there the way I needed. But also, yes ‚Äî you inspire me.¬†Yes, you were there when I needed you most later in life. And for that mom, you get a place in my heart where unconditional love will always show up, even when pain and fear try to break the bond we have tried to build and mend.

Maybe that‚Äôs what healing looks like. Not pretending the pain never happened. Not sugarcoating the trauma. But holding the dual truth: she hurt me, and she made me strong. She wasn‚Äôt soft, but she was fierce. She didn‚Äôt nurture me in the ways I craved, but she built a model of independence and survival I couldn‚Äôt ignore.

And honestly? I am honored to call her my hero. Even if it‚Äôs complicated. Especially because it‚Äôs complicated.

# Why She Inspires Me

My mom shows me that strength doesn‚Äôt always look like tenderness. That survival isn‚Äôt always pretty. That knowing your worth is non-negotiable.

She inspires me because she refuses to shrink. Because she chased careers, no one thought a tiny Black woman from the small town of Marianna, Florida, could have. Because she stared down cancer and walked away breathing. Because she doesn‚Äôt apologize for who she is, even when it makes her hard to love.

And maybe that‚Äôs the real lesson: sometimes the people who are hardest to love are the ones who teach you how to love yourself.

So here‚Äôs to my mom ‚Äî the woman who left me, who hurt me, who inspired me, who raised me in absence and showed up later in presence. The woman whose choices gave me trauma, but also gave me fuel to build a life that‚Äôs mine.

The woman who is my biggest wound and my biggest hero.

The paradox I live with.¬†The fire I carry.¬†I love you unconditionally.

Does anyone else get this?,"I've been noticing recently that I always feel this strange guilt whenever I'm talking to service workers at restaurants or coffee shops sometimes. It's got something to do with the dynamic of being served and me telling them what I want. Somehow I don't like that power dynamic, I don't know why. Obviously they're being paid and everything and maybe they don't see it the same way. But somehow being in that position where someone else is serving me makes me feel guilty. If I had it my way, I would clean my own plates after I'm done. That seems fair. Here I am being a fuckin' glutton and eating food while they're working so hard. It doesn't seem right.

I feel this kind of guilt a little bit in other service industries like healthcare, personal care (like the barber), etc. and I'll try to be an easy customer. But I feel it the most at restaurants and sometimes coffee shops for some reason. I remember just today after I ordered some coffee and was waiting, my knee-jerk reaction was to think: ""I'm just sitting here doing nothing, I should be helping!"" Obviously it doesn't make sense in this context so I don't take it seriously but the guilt lingers.

My best guess for where this comes from is watching how hard my mom worked when I was young because she stayed at home. I don't ever remember being shamed into doing anything but I do remember wanting to help and my mom refusing help. Or I was just unable to help because I didn't know how to cook or how my mom wanted me to do things. Despite her refusing help though, I could tell she was tired and she would sometimes complain. I wish she accepted help more and communicated her needs better but that's unrelated.

Usually preempted by taking a significant amount of time to focus on yourself and become who you truly are. When you fully know yourself you attract people who are better aligned to your life goals and position.

I was single for a period of 5 years after my last breakup. No dating and complete celibacy for the last 2 of those 5 years. I had done tremendous work on my hobbies, career, and life goals. I made a pivotal career change, bought a condo completely on my own, and fostered a village of wonderful friends from scratch. I was not looking for love, because I found it in myself. I had nurtured the most confident and self-aware version of myself. At 35, I was standing in my power and I was out in the world doing solo activities or group activities at least once a week.

This past May, I engineered a group for participating in one of my favorite water sports. I led multiple group outings and we all had such a great time. One of the girls who goes out with me on these meetups mentioned a mutual friend was interested and asking if he could join us. I said sure, of course. The more the merrier. It was already a co-ed group.

When he came out to our next meetup, I found him very physically attractive. I didn't think much more of it because I just don't pay much attention to men in a romantic sense these days out of self-protection. Long story short, after several more meetups that he joined over the course of 1-2 months--he contacted me directly to hang out at the beach. It was a one-on-one hangout, and he was very inquisitive about me. He asked me my relationship status and some other compatibility questions. I told him I've been single for years and wasn't looking, but if the right person were to come into my life, I'd go for it. He mentioned he was single as of 4 months ago, and that it was an on/off thing for a few years. At the end of our hangout on the beach, he turned to me directly and said he liked me. Even before his statement, I was warming up to him with the conversations we had all afternoon.

He pursued me very strongly over the next week or so, inviting me to go on long bike rides with him, stop for food, and chat on the beach. I was so excited to meet someone like this who I was finding myself really into. One night as we were eating and talking and staring into each other's souls, I mentioned that if he continues to see me like this, I'd like him to know that I do not want to share. His eyes lit up and he was blushing and he agreed that he would not like to share either. The following night, we were laying together on the beach at sunset and he asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes with enthusiasm. To this point, we had not yet been intimate.

He bought me roses. We had a few more hangouts before we went to bed together, and then when we did get intimate, everything was so natural and connected. I would argue that it was the best I'd ever had. We continued to see each other about 3-4 times a week (at his request). He introduced me to some of his best friends, told some of his family and associates about me, and mentioned to me that he'd like me to meet his brother soon. He would text me every day as well.

The sex kept getting better with each session, and we continued to have fun with outside activities. We would cook for each other, he'd make me coffee every morning I was there. He'd get up and watch the sunrise with me before I left for work on the weekdays I stayed over. In total, we were deeply involved multiple days a week for 4-5 weeks. We couldn't keep our hands off each other. Shared deep eye contact, talked about a lot of things. Nothing about marriage or that far ahead yet, which seemed fine for the timing. Nothing too deep about past relationships, again seemed too early. Just getting to know our day-to-day selves. By this point, he had given me a guest parking decal for his garage.

Last weekend, on Saturday morning I noticed he was suddenly very distant. I tried to have a conversation about it with him and he was somewhat vague and said he was feeling some anxiety. I asked him if he felt that I was spending too much time over and offered to take off for the day and give him some space. He said no, he wasn't thinking of that, but after another hour or so, he was still in such a different mood than usual. I told him, its not a problem and I'll get out of his space so he can relax and I left that Saturday around 3pm. He said he was going to go visit with his parents and talk with them.

I spent the rest of the weekend away and neither of us contacted each other until Monday when he texted me ""hope you had a relaxing rest of your weekend and I wish you a successful day"", to which I responded ""I'm good, and I hope you were able to relax as well and spend time with your family"". He said ""thank you! :)""

Tuesday, I figured I'd reach out to him first to keep it balanced. ""Hello, thinking of you. Hope your week is going well"". He answered promptly but cold. I let it go and said nothing more.

Wednesday, I decided to call him. He answered my call, but he said he was playing tennis with some friends and they were done but going to go get food. He said he'd call me back. He did not call me back that night; however, he texted me at 9am to apologize for not calling and that he stayed out late with the friends. I answered that I was glad he reached out and that I would like to know when I could stop by to get my gear from his house because I had plans to do the water sport we met doing and I had left the stuff there. He said he'd be home by 5. I said I'd let him know when I was out front for him to bring it out to me. He said ""Yes, but park downstairs because we deserve to have a conversation""

I agreed and went over, he brought me into his apartment and said ""I know you want to know what is going on with me""

I let him explain himself and it turned into a lengthy, vulnerable, emotional conversation about how he was feeling. He revealed that he was hit with a wave of unresolved emotions from his past relationship. He said that he no longer loved her, and that he ended it, but she keeps trying to pop up in his life. According to him, she showed up at his apartment unannounced some weeks ago (prior to us dating), and other things. He said he's resenting that he spent the last 2 years of their relationship together because they both wasted each others time, and he knew by then he didn't want to marry her and she wanted that. He said he had a session with his psychotherapist and they believe he's not ready to date as its still too fresh. He told me that he wanted to pause what we had going on so that he can continue therapy and work through it.

I said that I understood, but I was disappointed because I liked him so much and was looking forward to experiences to come. He said there's nothing that I did wrong, and that I am special and a ""worthy"" woman. He called me ""baby"" a few times as he was talking. He walked me to my car and carried my stuff for me. He embraced me tightly and kissed my neck. He said ""we'll talk soon"" and then he reclaimed the parking decal and let me go.

I am very proud of myself for accepting his explanation and not begging or trying to negotiate something less for myself; however, I am so very sad that this is the way its gone. I let myself be free and authentic with him and trust his intentions as his actions were those of someone who was genuinely interested, but I have no choice but to let him go in this situation. I'm not angry, but I'm totally shaken and feel like I'm withdrawing from hard drugs. I have been floating for the past month experiencing such an intense connection, and now its like I never even knew him.

I know it sounds like too much too soon, but his actions did line up with his words the whole time we were seeing each other. I am really frustrated because I wasn't even looking for anything, and now it dominates my thoughts. I don't really need any advise because I know I just need to re-focus on myself and go no contact, which I have the self-control to do. Would love some positive thoughts though because I was really falling in love with him and now I'm just stuck in a state of limerence and doubting my own reality that ever truly cared about me.",3,1756761711.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

How do I approach telling my parents about my 2 year relationship with a man 16 years older than me? 

I kept my relationship private from family and my best friend for two years because of the age gap and not being at my financial and career goals yet. The only person who knows in my life is my mom because she knows me. Even then she only tolerates it and fears very reasonably but refuses to meet him to ease those anxieties. It hurts my me and my bf because he doesn‚Äôt want my family to feel blind sighted but also just wants them to see how much he loves me. I tend to prioritize my future and personal development the most and am a very strong person. I truly believe in radical accountability for my life but feel stuck in this one area of integrating my relationship into family life. 

I told my mom about my bf, bc she knows all my life experience and how I figured a lot out on my own. Even in a relationship, I proved her wrong about her fears and miss assumptions of me not aspiring for independence. the last two years I lived out a hell lot of experiences from solo traveling, going to festivals, skydiving, hiking different mountains, backpacking adventures, living in Spain at 20 alone, built my own community of people and had so many stories coming back. I did this with MY OWN money and drive. On top of that, I saved $10k from working since I was 16, have strong investments in my ROTH IRA and brokerage, extended my graduation to focus on job searching for CS, stayed in honor roll, published my own paper, funded my own therapy, picked up weight lifting as a hobby and spent my free time learning different subjects to stay well rounded. These are things I did outside my relationship that were funded and worked for by me alone! To deduce it to my bf giving me money or depending on him because he spoils and treats me out a lot is an ouch sentiment; like give me my credit!! Our dynamic is a partnership not a dependency. With or without him I‚Äôm living out my side quests and working hard.  Of course since my bf makes much more than me he‚Äôs able to fund so many new couple adventures, gifts and ‚Äúprincess treatment‚Äù as a couple. 

My childhood friend has a different mentality than me and we hang out maybe once or twice a month. She is like a sister to me though. I feel so evil for betraying her by living a secret life. And I honestly have distanced myself due to feeling like I‚Äôm we are at different chapters. Idk how to approach the convo but I‚Äôm prepared for the consequence because she didn‚Äôt deserve the deception. I am not a good friend for that. 

My dad doesn‚Äôt know, my siblings don‚Äôt know, and my childhood friend doesn‚Äôt know. And a lot of my fear stems from my dad jumping to worst case scenario and blaming my mom or starting a huge fight, giving me silent treatment, and reverting back to old negative thought patterns about my capabilities. Or my little sister feeling hurt or weirded out. it is something at my core to want their acceptance. He spirals in anxiety a lot in life even though he doesn‚Äôt think so.  He jumps to conclusions of how any choice that remotely seems risky to him = throwing away my entire future. He says things that aren‚Äôt true about me when he irrationally anxious. And he is the PERSON I need to tell about my relationship the most because I want him apart of my life.

We both are not thinking about settling down for at least five years, and are just seeing where the future may take us because we want to travel the world, I want to build my career out of college and he wants to open his own practice as a lawyer. He never pressures me to change my life goals and will always be there to support me with what makes me happiest. We had similar boundaries and perspectives of what a healthy dynamic is.

Every adventure together, our date nights, and all the memories is the cherry on top.  my relationship with my bf has actually ignited my confidence to go after all the adventure I want in my 20s and my own accomplishments. 

I don‚Äôt know how to bring the conversation up and build the courage to it to them though that my relationship is serious. My bf has been patient. And I want to live with transparency with my parents and want them to understand me better. I want them to see our relationship is not what they assume‚Ä¶ does anyone have advice on how to bring the conversation up!  He‚Äôs encouraged me through out college when I was stressed about work, school and building projects for my resume to get my foot into tech. 


Context:
My bf has no kids or ex wife and spent his entire 20s working 60-70 hours a week, taking care of his dad with a terminal illness. he went to law school, just graduated when we met and was starting his own business. I love his work ethic, and how well rounded he is in life. He leads with compassion and wanting to do good for others. Everyone in his life has told me how deeply in love with me his. I will catch him smiling and laughing to himself and then talk about how he got a memory of me or some joke I made at him. We encourage each other to pursue and achieve the things we are passionate about and making choices that align with fulfillment and emotional health.

over the last two years we watched each other transform in every possible way for the better. He‚Äôs so wholesome and unapologetically himself. We get excited and our hearts melt over seeing love all around us wherever we go and notice about others. Every time we navigated a conflict or step forward together, we shifted it as an opportunity to grow our mutual understanding and problem solve together. we have become stronger and deeper in love.

He also has never stopped being a gentleman with me and surprising me with cute and thoughtful date nights. we are always taking down notes about things we say in passing to surprise each other. I helped him set up his business pages, website and his retirement investments. He has supported me through a lot of stress and when he started getting a lot more clients to where he could live off his client work comfortably and quit his 2nd job. he just amplified quality time with me, wanting to take care of me,  and being part of community. He sends a coffee subscription to my house bc i told him how my mom and i love coffee. I do not care for all these extravagant things he gifts me but it‚Äôs the thought behind it that makes me fills my heart.  most importantly he is so emotionally intelligent, empathetic and attunes to peoples emotions so well. I love the way he thinks about why behind everything and leads it with love. The best way I can describe his love is that Buddhist concept of ‚ÄúLoving without attachment.‚Äù

We have mutual understanding of how we both love our alone time, he‚Äôs not just my partner, he‚Äôs my best friend and self improvement buddy too ahaha. When I was about to say no to living in Spain alone for six months he talked me into it because it was my dream.The experience changed my life and I came back a better person. I realized how invested he was about me, when a couple months into dating, I picked up on a pattern of his that did not manifest yet. he was fearful of expressing his conflicting or uncomfortable emotions. I told him about how I picked up on it and wanted him to feel emotionally safe. how lack of emotional transparency can trickle into future misunderstandings in relationships if we do not understand our patterns. he started therapy immediately the same week to do the inner work for himself and to show up for me. he‚Äôs become so emotionally articulate and expressive I love it. It made me realize how much he was in it for a relationship with me and values his connection with me. We are always wanting to be there for each other!! ",2,1756760755.0,Advice,2,0.75,False

I‚Äôm 27 and most of my life I was an introvert and still am. Find happiness in reading, watching films, listening to music, going for a coffee, eating out, and such. 

I no longer wanted to use the apps last year. And wanted to change my lifestyle a bit. So I reconnected with an old friend of mine who was going out on his own, and we decided to go out together, practically every weekend. 

We‚Äôve made some great memories don‚Äôt get me wrong. Some nights have been great. Most though have been just.. not good? Waking up the next morning feeling like shit and feeling empty. 

I think the issue is, I go mainly to see if a hook up can happen. Or get a number. And while I have been approached, and approach a few times, I‚Äôve never actually hooked up. It‚Äôs pretty hard out there. Feel like it‚Äôs a matter of luck of sitting next to the right person.

But the issue is I focus way too much on women, and not enough on having fun. Some nights I dance here and there. But the truth is, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the environment I naturally belong in. 

Reddit threads told me not to have the self limiting belief of disliking clubs and bars and that‚Äôs why I approached it with an open mind. But a year later I think I genuinely do dislike being in this environment. I can‚Äôt relate to most of the people. The alcohol I don‚Äôt even like and just drink to vibe with the night. I hate the way it makes me feel. 

Even on nights when I have some social success, I get no fulfillment out of it really. Used to think me not liking socializing was a cope for dealing with my social awkwardness and the rejections I face. But even on nights where I make acquaintances and such, I don‚Äôt feel anything. It all feels superficial at the end of the night for me. 

I suppose having ADHD and OCD is what makes feel this way. The feeling isolation, and obsession with idea of hooking up and women in general. 

But if the environment were for me, I likely would not focus on that stuff too much. I go to the library and coffee shops with hopes that maybe I‚Äôll meet someone. If it doesn‚Äôt, which it hasn‚Äôt so far, I don‚Äôt care. Because I enjoyed reading history and philosophy at the library, or enjoyed my vanilla flavored coffee. I don‚Äôt obsess with the idea of romance because I at least am enjoying what I do. 

At the club however I think I hyper fixate on women because.. that‚Äôs all that interests me. Not the alcohol, not the music, not the environment.

And it sucks. Because I did genuinely want like a hook up phase. It just seems however I‚Äôm not wired to enjoy the environments in where they happen. 

I miss my old life. Again I made some great memories and I‚Äôm glad I got closer to my friends, but I miss feeling normal on the weekends, and not being tired. I think I was happier living a chill life 24/7. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. ",3,1756760561.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been thinking it‚Äôd be cool to have a small community where we could: hang out and make proper friendships, join segregated events (both online + in person) and play board games, coffee catch ups, hikes, support each other whilst balancing career/deen:life.

Just to be clear: the main focus is to make friends and build a community and if some people are interested then have an optional halal matching thing but that‚Äôs way down the line and not the aim of the group.

Three days ago I crashed my car and I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I‚Äôve been handling everything on my own and I‚Äôm starting to feel a little over my head.

Basically, I was in Toronto at like 3am after working a 12-hour shift and I was planning to stay the night at my friend‚Äôs. My mom suddenly started calling and pressuring me to come home. The train home wasn‚Äôt available at that time and before I got into my car I looked at getting an uber but it was $150 and I just paid my car insurance and didn‚Äôt have enough. I told her I was too tired but she kept pushing, so I got in the car. I tried to make it, grabbed a coffee, but I ended up nodding off on the highway going about 114km/h and swerved into the median. Side airbags went off, my ear was ringing, but I walked away okay. Thank god I didn‚Äôt hit anyone.

The cops showed up, were honestly really nice, took the report, asked if I wanted to warm up in their car until the tow came. I just blurted the truth right away, said I fell asleep, it was my fault. They asked if I wanted EMS and I said no, and the toll truck guy picked me up and I asked him not to drop it off at my house and he agreed but said he wanted to take me home. I asked him if he could drop me off 2 blocks away from my house so my mom wouldn‚Äôt see the car, he agreed. When I got in my mom was shouting at me and yelling and I didn‚Äôt want to tell her, but I told her what happened and she said ‚Äúgreat, you destroyed your car how brilliant‚Äù and went to sleep. I brushed my teeth and went to bed. The day after my mom asked me what I told the cop and I told her I told him the truth and she called me an idiot for not lying and saying ‚Äúyour tire blew.‚Äù That kinda messed with my head because I thought being honest was the right thing.

Now I‚Äôm stuck in insurance hell:
Tow + storage fees were already ~$600 but apparently insurance covers that.

I do have collision coverage. I had to call and open the claim myself. They said I need to strip my plates and grab my stuff, then they‚Äôll move the car to one of their shops Wednesday.
Deductible is $2,000 (I had to google what that even meant).

Rental car is covered somewhat but Enterprise told me deposit is $50‚Äì200 plus $0.25/km. Insurance wasn‚Äôt super clear on what exactly is covered.
Car is a 2015 Civic. Side airbag went off, side damage. I‚Äôm bracing for them to just total it.
All of this would be annoying enough, but I also have a concussion. I walked to the doctor this morning and he said it‚Äôs ‚Äúminor,‚Äù but my head rings, I‚Äôm light sensitive, get headaches. And meanwhile I‚Äôve been on the phone with insurance people, tow companies, rental people. It‚Äôs exhausting.

To top it off, my university classes start Wednesday. I need to move my stuff to London this week and I don‚Äôt even know if I should take the rental that far or just wait.

My mom hasn‚Äôt helped at all ‚Äî she just told me ‚Äúmaybe this knocked some sense into you.‚Äù So it‚Äôs been me figuring this out. My dad‚Äôs been away on a business trip and doesn‚Äôt know. Honestly I don‚Äôt want to tell him because it‚Äôs embarrassing and he‚Äôs stressed enough. I also feel guilty as hell for crashing the car he bought me as a graduation present, I feel like shit. I can pay the deductible out of savings I put aside for school. Like I‚Äôd rather figure this out, and pay the deductible and tell him when he gets back and it‚Äôs all cleaned up. My dad‚Äôs not the yelling type, he‚Äôs just reserved and quiet, but I feel like I piece of shit for listening to my mom while knowing I was too tired and crashing the car. (My parents are divorced and hate each other just to add context)


Questions:
Should I tell my dad, or just keep dealing with it myself? If you were a parent, would you want to know?
Do you think insurance will cover the damages or just write it off as a total loss?
Am I being dumb for not resting more with the concussion?
If they total the car, do they pay me pre-crash market value, or post-crash ‚Äúwreck value‚Äù?

I apologize for my absence to those of you who follow my recaps. It‚Äôs been a hard two months with a beloved elder in our family passing away (descanse en paz Tita Bat) and a shakeup at work where my terrible boss quit and left our team in utter chaos.¬†

However, fellow pepinos have lit the beacons of Gondor (iykyk) and summoned me to finish recapping the literary antics of Hilly Vanilli before we are subjected to her attempts to dance in DWTS with all the subtlety of a rat with a gold tooth.¬†

If you‚Äôre new to these long form posts, I‚Äôm reviewing Hillary‚Äôs 2025 book entitled ‚ÄúManual Not Included‚Äù - an autobiographical self-help tome/vanity project that Alec Baldwin financed to give his grifty second wife something to do other than talk to him 24/7 with her faux baby rasp.

So far, we‚Äôve slogged through chapters 1-3 and learned that Hillary Lynn Baldwin has MLM boss babe energy and a painfully precocious writing style. Here‚Äôs hoping her ghost writer took that paycheck and got some therapy.¬†I inadvertently skipped ¬†Chapter 4 ‚ÄúClickbait‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt matter at all because Hillary jumps around so much, but I'll get to it after this one.

Chapter 5 is entitled ‚ÄúTragedy‚Äù and clocks in at 20 pages with no pictures in the hardback version because it is SAD and SERIOUS in Hilz‚Äôs mind. Her chapters have no subheadings, but I wrote my own, to give us an idea of what the hell is happening on any given page.

**Marriage is Hard Work, but No One Has it Harder Than Hillary**

* Hillary opens by quoting her very traditional wedding vows to Alec to eat up her word count and blathers on about how ‚Äúfor better or worse‚Äù covers so very many unknowns. Yes, Hilz, most of us know that we can‚Äôt predict the future.¬†
* She notes ***‚ÄúWhile Alec and I have experienced plenty of ‚Äúfor worse‚Äù moments, one tragedy stands alone: an accidental death that left a life lost, a son without a mother, a family broken, friends without their person, and an industry without a very talented and creative artist. Our family will forever mourn the loss of Halyna.‚Äù***¬†
* She states that she separates Halyna Hutchins‚Äô death and the aftermath of her death and that she cannot speak to the former but only the latter (not that she uses those terms since Hillary has the writing abilities of a root vegetable).¬†
* According to Hillary she can speak to the aftermath of Halyna‚Äôs death because she is a wife and a mother - her entire identity as far as I can tell from this book.¬†Hillary recounts that ***‚Äúthe tabloid media will likely create headlines from this chapter‚Äù*** \- sis, this little ‚Äúbook‚Äù only generated the headlines you paid for.¬†
* What does this section reveal? She says the day of the shooting she was busy taking pictures of Maril√∫ and therefore ignored two of Alec‚Äôs phone calls because they had already spoken several times that day. When he texted her to call him asap, she wrote ***‚Äúmy heart and my stomach smashed together‚Äù*** \- quite the prose, no?¬†
* Sooooo. Let‚Äôs consider the source as Alec likes to say. Their conversation was recorded by the New Mexico police and released to the media. In that footage, Alec clearly asked her where she was and Hillary replied, ***‚Äúat Michelle‚Äôs‚Äù*** prompting the evergreen response from Alec ***‚ÄúMichelle who?‚Äù*** No mention of frolicking with one of their many kids and taking pictures. Let‚Äôs say it was a different conversation she‚Äôs talking about, then why was Alec asking where she was if they had already spoken? Whatever, even her lies are boring.¬†
* She notes ***‚Äúthis conversation¬†¬†- and this entire day- was full of confusion, disbelief, pain, nausea, anger, fear, and heartache.‚Äù*** Yeah, we could tell when Alec asked her to fly to New Mexico and she was like, ‚Äúoooh, maybe not such a great time.‚Äù¬†
* According to Hilz, though, that tepid response never happened - ***‚ÄúI remember the loss, the distress, the beating of the walls and screaming and shaking.‚Äù*** Think about how that is written - who was beating walls? Hilz? She sounded pretty cool and collected and Alec was only concerned about not wanting to do more movies.
* She keeps twisting the narrative though, tenacious little cross eyed ferret that she is, telling her readers ***‚Äúyou may have seen images of my husband, doubled over in shocked grief as photographers snapped pictures.‚Äù***¬†¬†Then she proceeds to say that she tried to write a play by play of the day but it‚Äôs too overwhelming for her. That's just a way to sidestep the actual terrible event then blather on some more about how she repeated to Alec ad nauseam ***‚Äúyou are not alone, and I am with you.‚Äù***¬†¬†¬†
* The narrative becomes all about her and how she was trying to navigate this terrible event ***‚Äúwith no manual or previous life experience to pull from.‚Äù*** Yet she describes having ***‚Äúmental health professionals‚Äù***¬†at her fingertips advising her ***‚Äúto get Alec to a quiet place, once he could return to us, to try to prevent PTSD as best as one possibly could after such an awful trauma.‚Äù*** Is Dr. Curly Fries from the TLC¬†¬†show giving this janky advice?¬†
* No matter, Santa H√≠l√°r√≠√° de las Decisiones Terribles handled the situation with her two brain cells and a fabricated friend: ***‚Äúa friend who worked in the news industry came over and sat me down: ‚ÄúYou need to get out of town. somewhere the media won‚Äôt expect. Alec is talking to law enforcement in Santa Fe. You need to take care of the children, so they aren‚Äôt exposed to the nastiness they will experiences outside your home‚Äù, she counseled.‚Äù*** Was this friend talking to Hillary or the toddlers bc this is some basic ass advice.¬†
* Hillary describes leaving her apartment before the sun came up and being ***‚Äúgreatly outnumbered‚Äù*** by this horde of photographers who somehow (!) didn‚Äôt recognize her when she stepped out of the building because she engaged in this bit of wizardry: ***‚ÄúI put my hair in front of my face, waited until the majority of the reporters were talking on cameras and walked very slowly out the door. I took a deep breath and stoically put one foot in front of the other, staying close to the shadows of the urban buildings. My heart was beating hard but I kept my walking rhythm steady. Eyes down, eyes down, eyes down I kept reminding myself. I have no idea how they didn‚Äôt see me.‚Äù***¬†Y'all, I can't with this doofus.
* Listennn. When I was three I would put a towel over my head and let my sweet dad know that I was invisible by saying ‚Äúno me ve‚Äù/ you don‚Äôt see me. This story is giving the same vibes minus a child playing make believe.¬†
* Supposedly another ‚Äúfriend‚Äù put Edu and Maril√∫ in a double stroller and walked through the throngs of reporters as unnoticed as Hilz did and they met up in the East Village where she went unnoticed despite her insistence that she is hounded by the press night and day. She told her friend/one of the nannies to ***‚Äúdrive north‚Äù*** and off they went to the tune of Benny Hill.
* Why north? She has no idea but muses that ***‚Äúbeing a city person, I imagined that if you were to hide from paparazzi, it should be somewhere rural. Remembering as well that the trauma therapist had told me that Alec should be somewhere quiet.‚Äù*** ¬†Reminding us that ***‚Äúnone of my close family lives in the United States now***‚Äù she decides to head to the town where her now deceased grandparents used to live hoping that would provide ***‚Äúsome spiritual support.‚Äù*** When I tell you even dust bunnies are smarter than Hillary.
* She and the nanny stop at a chocolate shop and Hilz tells the person tending the counter that her grandfather used to live in the town. The man responded ‚Äúsorry, I have no idea who that is.‚Äù She slinks off and searches for a place for them to stay while ***‚Äúour nanny drove our older children to Vermont‚Äù*** and this woman allegedly chased by paps for four hours until they got bored and stopped.
* Alec finally arrives in Vermont ***‚Äúafter spending time with Halyna‚Äôs family.‚Äù*** Is it possible to pull a muscle while cringing? The slimy way she works this sentence in is just gross. So Alec arrives and he‚Äôs a sobbing mess and she repeats ***‚Äúyou‚Äôre not alone, I‚Äôm here with you‚Äù*** and they fall asleep with Edu between them. Then Hillary‚Äôs phone falls to the floor with a loud bang and Alec wakes up screaming and shaking and she realizes he will never be the same and that ***‚Äúfrom now on I would need to take on the role of his protector.‚Äù*** Annnnnd, scene.
* Hillary recounts Alec has been diagnosed with PTSD and he has said many times that he wished he had died instead of Halyna. All of this seems like a reasonable response. What‚Äôs not reasonable is Hillary‚Äôs self-serving spin in this whole silly book.

**The Paparazzi Find Them in Vermont**

* Again, Hillary blames her lack of common sense on being a ***‚Äúcity girl‚Äù*** who didn‚Äôt realize that hiding out in a small town meant they stuck out like sore thumbs. They went to a pizza place and she blames the locals for ratting them out to the paps. But wait ‚Äì plot twist ‚Äì the locals subsequently stand up for them! A man puts his pickup between Alec and a pap! A woman at TJ Maxx tells Hilz she looks like she needs a friend and invites them over for Halloween!¬† A woman knocks on Hilz‚Äôs door and says there is a pap sleeping in his car in a church parking lot and ***‚Äútogether we essentially chased him away!‚Äù*** ¬†Too bad that pap was so terrified by Hillary and her new bestie that he neglected to take any pictures of Alec Baldwin‚Äôs wife making a scene as she ran him out of town.
* Hillary calls yet another of her mental health expert friends for advice on how to tell the kids what happened. They developed a script and a sequence that Hillary noted she was prepared to do alone because ***‚ÄúAlec was so broken.‚Äù*** But Alec stepped up and he and Hilz talked to Carmen (then 8) and Rafa (then 6) about what happened which is where Carmen allegedly said, ***‚ÄúI want to unknow this!‚Äù*** Look. Maybe she said it and maybe she didn‚Äôt. The issue is more that Hillary took these words and made them public to garner sympathy. The concept of shielding her kids is as foreign to Hillary Lynn as the concept of telling the truth about her fake accent.
* Of course her timeline is fuzzy, and she describes Alec being ***‚Äúsensitive to loud noises, sudden movements, crowds, anything that feels too heavy on the nervous system‚Äù*** all of the time, I guess.
* But ol Hilz had the fire of a hundred suns in her and nobody would take away her God-given right to go to Madman Espresso the day after Alec was criminally charged, dammit!
* With the press outside her apartment building Hillary describes the scene: ***‚ÄúI stood downstairs¬† in the lobby, talking to the doorman, who, after so many years, is like family now. The press crowded by our front entrance. ‚ÄúMija, no salgas.‚Äù Don‚Äôt go out, the doorman begged me.*** (Fuck allllllll the way off with this one, Hillary) ***‚ÄúI am going to go out, march past them, and walk across the street and order a coffee just like I have every right to do‚Äù‚Ä¶our doorman Joey looked at me, like you stubborn little crazy person and reluctantly opened the door. I set out with dread yet trying very hard to seem courageous. Maybe it would be ok? Nope. Big mistake. I got swarmed. I had to beg the paparazzi to give me space. Scared of being crushed, I suddenly felt an arm around my back, and before I knew it, I was being lifted across the street, straight into the tiny coffee shop. I opened my eyes and saw that it was Jason, our building‚Äôs super who had helped me.‚Äù***

Hillary. Have ten words with yourself and settle down. Nobody carried your narrow butt anywhere. Here‚Äôs the [recap of this incident in January 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/10ukh5t/january_2023_hilarias_ig_recap_159_posts_or_how/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

* Hillary then has the ordacity (props to Hilz‚Äôs Looney Tunes friend, Ramona Singer, for that one) to ~~write~~ say to her ghost writer ***‚Äúthe wickedness that ensured over the following year was a constant roller coaster.‚Äù*** ¬†She whines about the fact the no press were outside the Dev when the criminal charges against Alec were temporarily dropped, sniffing ***‚ÄúI was unsurprised by the hypocrisy of it.‚Äù*** Hold my earrings, friends. This is why our little sub is valuable. When bad people like Hillary and Alec try to rewrite the narrative with their millions, we hold the line. The North remembers.

**Alec‚Äôs Health Crises**

* Apparently Alec‚Äôs physical health has suffered along with his mental health since he shot Halyna, and the logistics of this one incident are a head scratcher: ***‚ÄúThe first time Alec passed out, he was sitting at the kitchen table, the Dedes on his lap, surrounded by our other kids. Suddenly his head flopped back, and his eyes rolled toward the back of his head. My children screamed, and I ran toward him, shouting for the kids to leave the room. I stood on the bench looking down at him, shaking him and shouting his name for what seemed like an eternity. Finally, he came to, and I brought him to the hospital. They said the stress of the situation was affecting his heart.‚Äù***
* I know I gripe about this a lot but where is the bloody editor, an editorial assistant, an editorial receptionist for Pete‚Äôs sake? Did the little kids tumble from his lap? If his head flopped back did he not crash to the floor? Why did she leap tall buildings in a single bound and land on the bench to look down at him? Why did no one call 911? Why doesn‚Äôt she know it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI took‚Äù him to the hospital, not ‚ÄúI brought‚Äù him there?
* She continues with weird specificity and tells us breathlessly that ***‚Äúon a Friday in March 2023, Alec‚Äôs health quickly declined. His hand became cold, and he could barely walk. I brought him to the emergency room*** (for the love of God, you TOOK him there you absolute potato)‚Ä¶***it was more stress, the doctors said‚Ä¶the women who work with us in our home are some of the most inspiring people I‚Äôve ever met and they have guided me through so much.‚Äù*** Those women deserve combat pay.
* They all get Alec off the couch and ask the building super and doormen to basically carry him to their car where Mikey, their driver, was waiting to drive them back to the hospital. Once there they have this exchange: ***‚ÄúAlec who is over six feet tall*** (ma‚Äôam WHAT) ***to my barely five foot three started saying to me you‚Äôre blocking my vision. I have a tendency to hyperfocus on things that plainly make no sense and understand everything through a very literal filter so I argued that this would be technically impossible due to our height difference.‚Äù***
* Amidst this scintillating intellectual debate, Alec slumps over in the backseat (but she claims she‚Äôs straining to hold him up, it‚Äôs a logistical shitshow) Mikey runs and gets nurses who come out and get him settled inside where he ***‚Äúdidn‚Äôt wake up for a long time and when he did, he couldn‚Äôt walk or remember much. It was spring break for the kids so I toggled between going home to care for them and rushing to the hospital to be with Alec throughout the day.‚Äù*** Where are the pepino timeline experts, bc this sounds as fake as her new bosoms.¬†
* He could¬†only walk with the help of a walker but the real hero was Hillary who had to carry her breast pump to the hospital bc Baby Ilaria was six months old and still breastfeeding. But the freezers full of milk, you ask? They are in the same boat as narrative cohesion ‚Äì never to be seen again.
* Alec had to finish filming Rust so clever Hillary decided to put an orthopedic boot on him to make it seem like he had a foot injury bc his ill health could ***‚Äúcomplicate an already complicated endeavor to finish the movie.‚Äù*** ¬†Hillary complains ***‚Äúthe press made fun of him for his horseback riding‚Äù*** then realizes that makes no sense because they were hiding his ill health so adds ***‚Äúin all fairness they didn‚Äôt \[understand what Alec was going through\] and yet it‚Äôs quite possible that they wouldn‚Äôt have cared if they did.‚Äù*** Pick a lane, crazy pants.

**The Trial**

* Hillary continues her disjointed saga with her explanation of why she only took Carmen and Ilaria to the trial in New Mexico: ***‚ÄúI initially wanted to bring all my children to Santa Fe, but it was so complicated, and I was afraid it would be seen as me using them for sympathy‚Ä¶Caren wasn‚Äôt in day camp and the other children had a routine to be kept occupied by‚Ä¶who knows if I got any of this right. It was the first time I was away from my children, bedsides going to the hospital to have another baby.‚Äù***
* She describes wanting to show no emotion to the press gallery in the courtroom so when Alec would come talk to her, she would put her hand on his face to avoid them reading his lips. Then it‚Äôs about her hurt feelings again: ***‚ÄúMonths later, my friends and I became oddly obsessed with this lawyer who breaks down legal cases. She is funny and smart, and we all enjoyed watching her. She is open about her ADHD and dyslexia, and I find her to be very courageous and inspiring. The way she speaks is busy and all over the place sometimes, and I see this in myself. You may even see it in this book. When she spoke about me and Alec, it felt clear that she didn‚Äôt like us, particularly me, whom she referred to as ‚ÄúAlec Baldwin‚Äôs wife."" It hurts my feelings, but what else was she supposed to believe when there was no reason given to see my humanity because of misinformation from the tabloids? At one point in an episode, she said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to watch Alec Baldwin‚Äôs wife petting his face again!‚Äù I wish she could know what I was juggling, sitting there trying to be a human, a wife, a mom, and a friend, while also being sitting clickbait.‚Äù***
* All she is in the public eye is Alec Baldwin‚Äôs weird wife, but now the millions being poured into making her an author, podcast host, and DWTS contestant make sense. She wants to be HILARIA and shine for her own miniscule merits, like Roxie Hart in *Chicago,* if you will.
* Here's my analysis: Hillary has been told by Alec, her sycophant friends, and her parents for so long that she is special that she believes it. She sees herself as quirky and charming and smart  and honestly cannot fathom why people react against her so strongly (just like my terrible boss).
* She‚Äôs *offended* people dislike her and notes ***‚ÄúI oftentimes don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing, but I do know I will throw myself to the character-assassinating wolves to protect Alec and my kids. Call me crazy? Go ahead, it‚Äôs happened so many times that here is no point to stopping now. I have to put my morals before my reputation and ego.‚Äù*** Lady, this book is a paean to YOU. You're just polishing your tarnished reputation and boosting your inflated ego - what are you even talking about?¬†
* She concludes with more praise for her own strength in the face of massive odds: ***‚ÄúI could have left Alec. I could have taken our kids with me and abandoned him. But I didn‚Äôt, I stood by him because it was the right thing to do. I saw and know the truth.‚Äù*** What was that bit about your ego, Hilz?

1n60ieu,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1n60ieu/explore_if_the_ninja_ce251_coffee_maker_delivers/,Explore if the Ninja CE251 Coffee Maker Delivers Quality Brewing Review,"Testing out the Ninja CE251 Coffee Programmable Brewer has been a unique and delightful experience. This coffee maker has quickly become a central part of my mornings, not just for its impressive brewing capability but also for the small details that make it incredibly convenient. Coming from someone who relies on coffee to start the day (and maybe survive it), I knew I had to really put this appliance through its paces. From brewing small batches during midweek trials to preparing a full carafe on weekends, the Ninja CE251 has stayed consistent. It's not just about performance, though; there are aspects you should be aware of before purchasing.

**Design & Build Quality**

The sleek black and stainless steel finish immediately caught my eye, blending perfectly into my kitchen‚Äôs contemporary aesthetic. It‚Äôs compact for a 12-cup machine, measuring 8""x10""x14"", which means it doesn‚Äôt hog counter space. The intuitive buttons and a clear water reservoir make operation straightforward, even for someone who gets blurry-eyed without their first coffee. While the overall build feels sturdy, especially with the glass carafe and stainless accents, the plastic components ‚Äì like the warming plate ‚Äì might not give off the premium vibe some people might expect. That said, I found them functional and easy to maintain.

**Hotter Brewing Technology**

It's not just a snazzy marketing term. After testing various coffee makers, I can say the richer, hotter brew delivered by this machine stands out. The ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù and ‚ÄúRich‚Äù brew options result in coffee that‚Äôs not only flavorful but free from any bitter aftertaste, which is the bane of most budget brewers. Using the mid-brew pause to snag my first cup before the cycle finishes was a small but handy feature. I did wonder, though, if the brew strength difference between ""Classic"" and ""Rich"" was dramatic enough to warrant two options. Either way, both modes produced a satisfying cup.

[Check Ninja CE251 Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b07s98411n/)

**Convenience for Busy Mornings**

There's nothing better than waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee, thanks to the programmable delay brew function. I tested this by setting it up before bed, and sure enough, it delivered fresh coffee by 7 a.m. sharp. The removable 60-ounce water reservoir is a lifesaver. Instead of needing acrobatics to pour water into the machine directly, I could fill it easily at the sink. That reservoir design feels less prone to spillage. The adjustable warming plate, though functional for keeping coffee warm up to 4 hours, didn‚Äôt quite keep the last cup as hot as I‚Äôd have liked beyond the 3-hour mark.

**Small Batch Brewing**

Not every morning calls for 12 cups of coffee, does it? The small batch function (1-4 cups) was surprisingly effective at maintaining the same rich taste without that watered-down feel machines often produce when brewing smaller quantities. I found myself regularly turning to this option mid-afternoon. That said, brewing anything less than three cups occasionally introduced inconsistency in strength.

**Advantages**

- Flavorful brews with no bitterness‚Äîgreat for coffee lovers craving a quality cup.  
- Convenient programmable settings, perfect for adjusting to your schedule.  
- Easy-to-clean filters and descaling function, reducing maintenance headaches.  
- Compact size paired with attractive black/stainless aesthetics.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- The warming plate doesn‚Äôt maintain optimal temperature toward the end of the 4-hour cycle.  
- Plastic portions feel somewhat less durable compared to stainless parts.  
- The disparity between ""Classic"" and ""Rich"" brewing modes might not be as stark for all users.  

**Product Comparisons**

Stacking this up against direct competitors like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Ninja CE251 punches above its weight in some areas but has room for improvement in others. The Ninja CE251 is exceptionally good at delivering rich, evenly brewed coffee thanks to its Brew Technology. However, the Cuisinart sometimes takes home the medal for more advanced customization of coffee settings. The Hamilton Beach, on the other hand, offers versatility by allowing both single-serve pods and carafe brewing. If you're all about the irresistibly rich coffee quality and convenience-first design, the Ninja outshines in that category. Still, it doesn't carry the dual flexibility of machines like the FlexBrew.

**Price Performance**

Considering the features packed into this coffee maker, it delivers substantial value for its price point compared to market rivals. Moreover, the programmable functions, reusable permanent filter, and water reservoir, which shouldn‚Äôt be underestimated, all contribute to fewer recurring purchases and efficiencies in everyday use. Whether the slightly plastic feel offsets this is subjective‚Äîit didn‚Äôt bother me personally, but for others, it may. Ultimately, the CE251 positions itself as a solid middle-ground option: offering some premium features without entirely elevating the price tag to premium territory.

Three days ago I crashed my car and I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I‚Äôve been handling everything on my own and I‚Äôm starting to feel a little over my head.

Basically, I was in Toronto at like 3am after working a 12-hour shift and I was planning to stay the night at my friend‚Äôs. My mom suddenly started calling and pressuring me to come home. The train home wasn‚Äôt available at that time and before I got into my car I looked at getting an uber but it was $150 and I just paid my car insurance and didn‚Äôt have enough. I told her I was too tired but she kept pushing, so I got in the car. I tried to make it, grabbed a coffee, but I ended up nodding off on the highway going about 114km/h and swerved into the median. Side airbags went off, my ear was ringing, but I walked away okay. Thank god I didn‚Äôt hit anyone.

The cops showed up, were honestly really nice, took the report, asked if I wanted to warm up in their car until the tow came. I just blurted the truth right away, said I fell asleep, it was my fault. They asked if I wanted EMS and I said no, and the toll truck guy picked me up and I asked him not to drop it off at my house and he agreed but said he wanted to take me home. I asked him if he could drop me off 2 blocks away from my house so my mom wouldn‚Äôt see the car, he agreed. When I got in my mom was shouting at me and yelling and I didn‚Äôt want to tell her, but I told her what happened and she said ‚Äúgreat, you destroyed your car how brilliant‚Äù and went to sleep. I brushed my teeth and went to bed. The day after my mom asked me what I told the cop and I told her I told him the truth and she called me an idiot for not lying and saying ‚Äúyour tire blew.‚Äù That kinda messed with my head because I thought being honest was the right thing.

Now I‚Äôm stuck in insurance hell:
Tow + storage fees were already ~$600 but apparently insurance covers that.

I do have collision coverage. I had to call and open the claim myself. They said I need to strip my plates and grab my stuff, then they‚Äôll move the car to one of their shops Wednesday.
Deductible is $2,000 (I had to google what that even meant).

Rental car is covered somewhat but Enterprise told me deposit is $50‚Äì200 plus $0.25/km. Insurance wasn‚Äôt super clear on what exactly is covered.
Car is a 2015 Civic. Side airbag went off, side damage. I‚Äôm bracing for them to just total it.
All of this would be annoying enough, but I also have a concussion. I walked to the doctor this morning and he said it‚Äôs ‚Äúminor,‚Äù but my head rings, I‚Äôm light sensitive, get headaches. And meanwhile I‚Äôve been on the phone with insurance people, tow companies, rental people. It‚Äôs exhausting.

To top it off, my university classes start Wednesday. I need to move my stuff to London this week and I don‚Äôt even know if I should take the rental that far or just wait.

My mom hasn‚Äôt helped at all ‚Äî she just told me ‚Äúmaybe this knocked some sense into you.‚Äù So it‚Äôs been me figuring this out. My dad‚Äôs been away on a business trip and doesn‚Äôt know. Honestly I don‚Äôt want to tell him because it‚Äôs embarrassing and he‚Äôs stressed enough. I also feel guilty as hell for crashing the car he bought me as a graduation present, I feel like shit. I can pay the deductible out of savings I put aside for school. Like I‚Äôd rather figure this out, and pay the deductible and tell him when he gets back and it‚Äôs all cleaned up. My dad‚Äôs not the yelling type, he‚Äôs just reserved and quiet, but I feel like I piece of shit for listening to my mom while knowing I was too tired and crashing the car. (My parents are divorced and hate each other just to add context)


Questions:
Should I tell my dad, or just keep dealing with it myself? If you were a parent, would you want to know?
Do you think insurance will cover the damages or just write it off as a total loss?
Am I being dumb for not resting more with the concussion?
If they total the car, do they pay me pre-crash market value, or post-crash ‚Äúwreck value‚Äù?
 Any advice would be appreciated.

Key notes:

* Ranger Stews were only good to me for combating scurvy;
* I didn't need any of the 51 birch bark teas (**the whole time I might have lost only 1% condition**);
* I used up all 35 acorn coffees and around 37 regular coffees, alongside a lot of water during time skipping.
* Calorie conditions would have been met with the 12 peach pies and 144 rose hip pies (not counting the 5 days of no cabin fever with ranger stews), but in order to conserve the pies I had to alternate eating cooked venison to fill up hunger. 
* **I harvest-cancelled my bear skin coat so much it hates me now.**

Detailed Review,"Testing products like the Homenjoy HEY001 and understanding real-world performance is part of my daily routine as I dabble in trying household essentials. When it comes to this particular water filter, specifically the W10295370A replacement compatible with Whirlpool refrigerators and others, it promises cleaner water while being eco-friendly in design.

**Unboxing and Setup Experience**  
The unboxing was as straightforward as it gets. Inside the simple yet functional packaging, you find three filters neatly packed. Anyone who has ever tangled with over-complicated setup processes will appreciate this filter's ease of installation. No tools? No problem. It clicked into place with minimal effort and aligned seamlessly with my Whirlpool refrigerator. It's advertised to work with models EDR1RXD1, W10276924, W10291030, and more. I tested it on another model listed in its compatibility chart, and it delivered as promised.

[Check Homenjoy HEY001 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0ddl59k7h/)

**Performance You Can Taste**  
Once hooked up, the multi-stage filtration feature really stood out. Using activated carbon made from Sri Lanka coconut shells, this thing pulls its weight. Initially, I didn't expect any difference, but the taste of my water? Unbelievable. Gone were the hints of chlorine and that mildly metallic city-water tang. Instead, I got crisp, almost ""mountain spring""-level clarity (well, as close as a filter can get). For anyone paranoid about contaminants, the removal of sediment, lead, and unpleasant odors ensures peace of mind. Testing it around the house became a small event‚Äîtea, coffee, or drinking straight from the fridge; everything tasted noticeably better. Even my picky younger sibling, who insists all water tastes ""weird,"" gave his stamp of approval.

**Build Quality and Durability**  
Built with food-grade, BPA-free materials and certified under NSF/ANSI standards, the filter has solid credentials. During testing, I pushed its boundaries by running it under varying water pressures and temperatures. It passed the promised 400 PSI burst pressure and resisted the 100,000 water hammer test like a champ. The sturdy sealing ring deserves a special mention; it prevented leaks flawlessly through weeks of heavy use, keeping the fridge interiors dry and tidy.

**Highlights**  
- Easy tool-free installation compatible with multiple fridge models.  
- Natural purification using coconut shell-activated carbon for better water absorption.  
- BPA-free, certified build under NSF/ANSI standards keeps things safe.  
- Consistent performance even under high water pressure and extended usage.  

**Weaknesses**  
No review is complete without giving the cons due attention. A few areas slightly detracted from the experience:  
- Its six-month or 200-gallon capacity is decent but could feel short-lived for larger households.  
- While installation is easy, the lack of a clear instruction guide was an oversight.  

**Comparative Market Rivals**  
Having previously tested EveryDrop filters (their OEM equivalent for Whirlpool), a direct comparison was obvious. The Homenjoy HEY001 held its own in terms of functionality while being a more affordable option. However, EveryDrop's official branding reassures some consumers who might prioritize name loyalty. On the other hand, generic or lower-end filters like those from PureGreen lacked the same filtration and durability‚Äîsometimes breaking mid-use. Homenjoy sits comfortably in the sweet spot of price and efficiency.

**Cost Performance**  
Value always plays a huge role in my assessments. While filters vary significantly in pricing, the Homenjoy HEY001 delivers exceptional quality without emptying your wallet. Major selling points like enhanced filtration, reliability under tested conditions, and compatibility with multiple refrigerators made it feel like a worthwhile buy. For users seeking affordability that doesn't compromise on health standards, this filter proves to be a smart choice.

1n60b4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1n60b4y/the_beast_within_my_home/,The beast within my home,"‚ÄãMy life is a cycle of the mundane and predictable. I spend my waking hours working at the local police department in a small village right on the English coast of Port Isaac, North Cornwall. It's not a place known for anything more than petty crimes‚Äîlike when a local gets upset their neighbor hasn't put their recycling in the correct box. I even had to laugh at one case: when Mrs. Green lost her dog, ""Margarine."" Just imagine two community police officers pacing around town, calling the dog's name at every corner. It was, to say the least, entertaining.
‚ÄãI love my job and do my best to help the residents of this little old village as much as I can. After a long day of policing, I like to wind down in my rented two-bedroom cottage with a decaffeinated coffee‚Äîfreshly brewed, with two sugars, milk, and creamer, of course. Then I watch whatever the TV stations have to offer; my favorite genres are comedy and action.
‚ÄãAnyway, I'm rambling at this point. The reason I'm writing this down is because I've been getting an uncanny feeling that something is with me in the cottage. It's nothing too heavy, but it feels like I'm being watched by an owl in a tree or a cat hidden away, passively observing my every move.
‚ÄãI let this feeling pass most nights, mostly because I‚Äôm too tired from my busy work schedule, but tonight I just couldn‚Äôt shake it. I couldn't simply dismiss the feeling of being watched as I normally can, because tonight I saw something. Just a short flash of a shadowy figure in the darkened corner of my living room near the TV, anchored there with its feet and hands up. At first, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me, so I turned off the TV and stared blankly at the screen, trying to piece together what I'd just seen, trying to rationalize what could have possibly been there.
‚ÄãBut as I stared at the now-blank screen with my reflection looking back at me, I saw something tall, slender, and shadowy standing behind me. In shock and horror, I looked back swiftly, but to no avail‚ÄîI saw nothing. ""What the hell is happening?"" I shakily said to myself.
‚ÄãAfter a while, I felt my heart stop racing and sank back down into my sofa, continuing to watch my favorite action movie, Bad Boys, until I fell asleep. I felt a slight unease that night, and it must have reflected in my subconscious because I had a dream. In it, I was in my living room, and this creature was trying to tell me something. It sounded like ""shimaki"" or maybe ""shimmy""; I couldn‚Äôt fathom what it was saying. I couldn‚Äôt ask it to show me what it meant because I was paralyzed on my sofa, both in reality and in my dream. But one thing I did notice was that it was pointing to a wall in the living room, to a piece of tile covering a small crevice‚Äîsomething I had wallpapered over when I first moved in two months ago. I truly thought nothing of it. I assumed it was put there for a reason, and unbeknownst to me, it was...
‚ÄãI jolted up from my dream as if it was some form of nightmare. But for me, it wasn't. I was too invested and curious about this dream and the thing I saw in the living room the night before. I looked at my phone to see what time it was; the phone said ‚Äú4:50 AM.‚Äù ""Screw it,"" I thought. ""I may as well get up. I have to get ready for work in an hour anyway.""
‚ÄãI went to make my morning coffee, as routine and mundane as any other workday, but I couldn't stop looking at that damn wall. All I could think about was what was behind that strangely placed tile. As I made my toast and coffee, I thought to myself, ""To hell with it!"" and went to peel back the wallpaper to find the tile.
‚ÄãAs I started tearing the paper, I caught myself on it, getting a rather deep and unusually bloody paper cut, as if it had been cut with a razor. ""How odd,"" I thought. I could see the tile, though, and I used my elbow to break it through. What lay behind it shocked even an officer like me to the core.
‚ÄãFirst, there was the rancid smell of something rotten that had been sitting there for a while. I initially thought it was a mouse or a small rodent, but what that crevice revealed was something far more sinister than I could have ever imagined. It was a jar filled with salt and sludge. I thought to myself, I‚Äôm not touching that with my bare hands, so I grabbed some gloves from my uniform pocket and proceeded to pick the jar up from the crevice. The stench was enough to make me want to vomit, but my curiosity outweighed my disgust, and I pressed on.
‚ÄãOpening the jar onto my coffee table, I could barely tell what was in the salt because it was so shrunken, but I knew it was a kidney‚Äîa shriveled, dried-out kidney. I was sickened to my core. I took another look at the crevice and noticed a picture and a letter. I didn't pay much mind to the photo; I read the letter first. To my disbelief, what I read was a poem written shakily, as if a child had scrawled it in a hurry.
‚ÄãThe poem went like this:
‚ÄúMy name is Shimalaki, a god of worlds undone,
I was the silence in the stars before your light begun.
I am the void you can't outrun, the darkness in your soul,
And I have come to take a part, to make myself whole.
I whisper truths in waking dreams, a voice of ancient dread,
I show you things you cannot face, from the shadows I have bred.
You are the cage, the willing host, my hollow, silent prey,
I make your hands a perfect tool to pull the light away.
For I will feast on innocence and turn their prayers to lies,
I'll feel their hearts stop beating, behind your waking eyes.
You beg your gods to hear your plea, to break this unholy curse,
But they have long forgotten me, and now you have my verse.
They can't save you, not in flesh, not in a final prayer,
For I am what you've long become, a shadow filled with fear.
Your soul is mine to reap, your blood is mine to spill,
I am the broken promise, a vessel I can fill.‚Äù
‚ÄãI was in utter shock and horror when I read the poem. This wasn‚Äôt like anything I‚Äôve seen or heard of before, and that name, ""Shimalaki,"" was what it was trying to say in my dream. Its name. I put the withered paper down next to the spilled-out remains of the jar on the coffee table. I hesitantly reached for the final piece of this bizarre and somewhat disturbed puzzle, and what I saw made me physically and mentally sick. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever recover from what I witnessed. It was... oh god... a picture of a naked girl with blood flowing from her vagina.
‚ÄãI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what all this means, but it's not something I‚Äôm going to let slide. I immediately called my local police station and started an investigation. Two cars full of Cornwall's finest forensic detectives rushed to the scene in a matter of hours, and what they discovered beyond that crevice will haunt me for the rest of my life. They did some background research on the little old cottage and told me it has a horrific history. The locals had kept it very hidden, to the point where it was like a folk tale to most.
‚ÄãThe person who lived in my cottage long before me, long before Mr. O‚ÄôDale, was a wicked individual who preyed on children. He was found in the living room, hanging from the wooden beam in 1965, and surrounding him were Polaroid photos of his child victims. I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll recover from what I've witnessed, but I sure as hell won't be sleeping tonight, and I sure as hell won't be staying in this cottage another night. Pray for me and my recovery because if what the poem said is true, I‚Äôm next for the hunt.",2,1756759717.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

Welcome to the future‚Äîgrab a mug.

In a world where AI is growing faster than my impatience during a software update, we find ourselves poised on the edge of innovation's knife. The rapid evolution of AI, like a caffeinated squirrel, is sprinting into arenas once reserved for sci-fi. But while some see a promising future where machines and humans co-author the tale of progress, others fear a narrative penned by our own digital creations might not feature us in the happy ending. 

Elon Musk suggests AI is advancing at an exponential rate, which means before we know it, we'll be arguing with our smart fridges about whether it‚Äôs really time to go on a diet. Stephen Hawking, on the graver side, raised alarms that unchecked AI could be the last invention we ever need to complete. So, are we crafting a future ally or a digital overlord?

Not everyone is worried, though. Some, like Satya Nadella, see AI as a collaborative effort‚Äî‚Äòman with machine,‚Äô rather than against it. This harmonious vision places AI as the assistant manager in the great business of life, helping us to learn, create, and maybe find our lost car keys.

Yet, as Garrett Smith points out, the real peril might not be an unchallengeable AI, but our own reckless trust in it. This blind faith could lead us where no faulty GPS has before‚Äîwe might find ourselves taking a left turn into chaos. 

But it‚Äôs not all dystopia and gloom. AI offers undeniable opportunities‚Äîenhancing everything from daily convenience to healthcare, pushing humanity into its next renaissance.

Here we stand, guided by the wisdom of experts through the quotes shared above, tasked with steering the AI ship through both potential treasure troves and stormy seas. So, as we write the next chapter in this tech thriller, the question remains:

I will never understand why customers lie to get remakes. I work at a kiosk and just now, I had someone call claiming they got two lattes and they tasted horrible. I‚Äôm the manager, so I have to my due diligence and ask a few questions: 
Q: when did you come in? 
A: I don‚Äôt know. My sister got them. 
Q: does she remember who made them, what they look like, etc?
A: no, she‚Äôs not by me right now. I have no idea. 
Q: does she happen to have a receipt? 
A: I don‚Äôt know. 
I make people work a little bit for remakes when I know they‚Äôre lying. Maybe that makes me a hard ass, but I don‚Äôt appreciate customers lying on my team to get some new drink. I tell her to bring in both cups with all the liquid still in them and a receipt if she has it. She brings in one cup, warm and without ice, so old I honestly think it‚Äôs from several days ago. There‚Äôs no writing on this cup, and I know the barista who worked this morning does not miss a beat when it comes to that. She wants her two Venti lattes with 8 Vanilla, 8 Classic, Breve, and caramel drizzle. I make them and harp again about bringing in a receipt. She just smirks at me and walks off. WHY DO THEY LIE?? Either go back to the store you actually got it from, or just be honest with yourself and deal with your own fuckup. 

If you forgot about your coffee, not my problem. If a barista at another store made it wrong, not my problem. I know my team and they kick ass. It just disrupts my sense of justice. I‚Äôll always do the remake for a customer, lying or not; it‚Äôs my job not only as a barista, but it‚Äôs my job as a manager. I only wish people were more honest about things like that.

1n608g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1n608g7/discover_if_the_best_singleserve_coffee_maker_by/,Discover if the best single-serve coffee maker by Keurig K-Compact lives up to the hype,"Testing the Keurig 5000376527 K-Compact Coffee Maker felt like a morning ritual that combines simplicity and convenience. The compact design was the first thing that caught my eye. Coming in at just over 8 inches wide, it fit snugly on my kitchen counter, leaving plenty of space for my other gadgets. Its matte black exterior provided a sleek, modern look that matched almost any kitchen aesthetic. As someone who doesn‚Äôt like my kitchen to feel cluttered, this small detail went a long way in making the coffee maker a welcome addition.  

**Performance That Gets the Job Done**  
The coffee maker brews coffee in multiple cup sizes‚Äî6, 8, and 10 ounces‚Äîperfect for any caffeine fix. I typically start my day with a strong 6-ounce brew, and the taste was bold enough to wake me up instantly. Friends who visit often prefer the 10-ounce option, and it‚Äôs nice to have a device that caters to personal preferences. The brewing process is surprisingly quick, delivering fresh coffee in under a minute. Whether I was rushing out the door in the morning or leisurely enjoying my weekend coffee, the speed never disappointed.  

[Ready for Keurig 5000376527 K-Compact Coffee Maker? See the Amazon deal.](https://triopd.com/p/b0bv9hkmnt/)  

**Smart Start and Easy Controls**  
Operation couldn‚Äôt be simpler thanks to the Smart Start feature. This machine heats up and brews the coffee in one smooth process, eliminating an extra step. There‚Äôs no waiting for it to heat before brewing, which I found to be a lifesaver on busy mornings. The button controls are so intuitive that even my tech-averse mom could figure it out on her first try. Insert a pod, press a button, and voil√†‚Äîcoffee is ready.  

**A Compact Workhorse**  
The 36-ounce removable water reservoir is larger than I expected for such a compact model. It easily allowed me to prepare three to four cups before having to refill. For something that takes up so little space, it‚Äôs refreshing to not feel like I‚Äôm constantly refilling water. The removable aspect also made cleaning a breeze. Even the accidental spills I caused one groggy morning were no challenge to clean up.  

**Good Points**  
- Compact design makes it ideal for small kitchens.  
- Multiple cup sizes cater to individual preferences.  
- Brews coffee quickly in under a minute.  
- Smart Start feature simplifies the heating and brewing process.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Limited to K-Cup pods unless you purchase a separate reusable filter.  
- The reservoir, while convenient, might need frequent refilling if used frequently in a larger household.  
- Restricted to single-serve functionality, which might not suit everyone.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to its competitors like the Nespresso Vertuo, I found Keurig‚Äôs model a bit more straightforward and easier to maintain. The Nespresso is known for its craftsmanship and richer espresso, but it also has a steeper learning curve and higher cost for pods. Meanwhile, the Keurig excels in its simplicity and speed. On the other side, there‚Äôs the Hamilton Beach Scoop single-serve coffee maker, which provides the benefit of brewing with ground coffee without needing additional adapters. However, Hamilton Beach‚Äôs device lacked the customizable size options and polish Keurig offers.  

**Price Performance**  
For its price point, the coffee maker feels like a great deal. Its combination of compact design, easy operation, and variety in brew sizes makes it a solid choice for anyone prioritizing convenience. You could argue there are fancier machines out there, but if you‚Äôre looking for an everyday coffee maker that‚Äôs efficient and reliable, this one offers excellent value. It felt like most money spent went right into making my coffee routine easier and less stressful.

.

.

.



1.  Gypsy desperately trying to talk to Jeff. Jeff apologizes for the way he acted on Friday by hanging up on Gypsy and tells her that he‚Äôs not trying to miss her calls. 


2.  Gypsy writes to Jeff that she‚Äôs not going to pester him about being together anymore. She understands he needs to trust and forgive her before that can ever happen. She knows he doesn‚Äôt trust her. The letter she wrote him was meant for closure, she failed as a partner. She won‚Äôt defend her actions. Gypsy was searching for someone to ease her pain, then she found Jeff. He gave her his heart and she didn‚Äôt give him the amount of devotion and dedication he deserved. The letter she sent him was nothing but a peace offering to show him how much she understands she hurt him and she‚Äôs sorry. Gypsy then gives an example about how whenever shes wronged by a partner, the endless mission for closure would drive her insane. The questions she had were never answered, she was left to wonder why and then her pain was mocked as if she was the one in the wrong. She tells Jeff no matter what she‚Äôs said in the past, she could never let Ken back in. He said wonderful things to her post break up which would‚Äôve at one time meant the world to her, but she can‚Äôt trust him. She will never forget he abandoned her. She can‚Äôt let that go enough for him to be in her life, not even if they‚Äôre friends. She said if he can‚Äôt forget what she said in June, she doesn‚Äôt blame him because now she‚Äôs been on both sides of the spectrum of pain. She‚Äôs been hurt and she‚Äôs hurt someone else. Gypsy then talks about how Jeff kept her on Jpay, he‚Äôs reached out once without he initiating, he still fights for her freedom, why does he care if she‚Äôll be released? Why does he do any of this? Gypsy says he keeps pushing her away and exhausts himself trying to explain why they can‚Äôt be together. She says, the reason isn‚Äôt because he doesn‚Äôt still want her, it‚Äôs because of mistrust. She wants Jeff to tell her he still doesn‚Äôt want her then, tell her she was a mistake, tell her he‚Äôs just gonna go back to his ex Jen, or whoever, and tell her he‚Äôs made a huge mistake getting with her and wants nothing to do with her. Jeff answers, tells Gypsy to stop worrying about his stressors in life, hes just depressed. He wants to talk to her but it always comes back to one thing, Gypsy always thinks they‚Äôre getting back together or she keeps asking why they can‚Äôt be together. He talks about her hopefully being good in prison. He tells her he‚Äôs NOT dating anyone. Then says someone contacted him and he wants to tell Gypsy about it, but not to get stressed as it went well. He then tells Gypsy he cares about her and wants to see her do well.


3.  Gypsy wants to send Jeff a package of a used shirt she‚Äôs worn with her sent on it. Gypsy then talks about how she‚Äôs been practicing wearing high heels by walking on her tippy toes, she has to practice so she can give Jeff a Victoria Secret Fashion Show, she loves wings:). Gypsy signs an email as, ‚Äúlove, your weird socially awkward, incarcerated, semi famous, sexy but cute, mousy voice, frizzy curly brown haired, needy eyed, pouty lipped girlfriend.  Gypsy then tells Jeff that he‚Äôs the only one who calls her by her real name, GypsyRose, she finds it special. 


4.  Gypsy lecturing Jeff about his health. Asks if he knows if he has issues with his cholesterol. She then goes into a detailed message about a new regiment Jeff should follow to get into the best health as possible. ‚ÄúTake every day: Iron, B-12, Multivitamin. Cut back to: 1 light beer, 1 cig A DAY. And get up an hour earlier to work out. Cardio (running) weights, simple 10lbs weights are fine. If you do not have these vitamins or work out equipment, go to Walmart and buy em. :) AND make an appointment with your physician for a recent physical. We need to know how your health is currently so we can properly address your needs. P.S we can work on eating habits later.‚Äù


5.  Jeff says something strange about the flu shot getting to Gypsy. He then says he had a vision of her in his head of her trying to hit herself against the bathroom wall trying to clear out her lungs. Gypsy says Jeff should apologize to Larry (idk who tf Larry is). She says he can‚Äôt expect him to be chummy with him when he wasn‚Äôt apologized. Gypsy gets her stimulus check and asks how she should save it, when she gets released, dinner on her, the hotel, wine and breakfast is also her treat. Gypsy also says Rod approves of their relationship. Gypsy then says ‚ÄúI stayed up late to catch up on the book, you are right it is getting better. That description of the train reminded me of the bus ride to prison. With the peacekeepers being the COs of course. We were chained with oun hands cuffed in front, shackles linking us to each other and even the step down off the bus, a struggle for how far our feet could reach the ground. Hauling us out like we were pieces of shit and had no encouragement to make us feel any better than animals. I did send my father an email and I told him about us. When it comes to you and I, I am very careful of who I let know what. I don't blab everything. I always keep a certain level of privacy for just us. It's been this long and so far all has been very enjoyably exclusive. I don't plan on anyone else knowing, I informed the two closest people in my life next to you, and that's all I feel is necessary.‚Äù 


6.  Gypsy talks about a man in her online group, (this is probably autistic man who‚Äôs very obsessed with Gypsy), Gypsy says she barely talks to him anymore and she knows when she talks to him later he‚Äôll be apologetic. She talks about how in love with Jeff she is. And then talks about eloping in Florida or the cape up in Massachusetts (Bryan also lives in Massachusetts üòí), Gypsy then asks Jeff what would be the top 5 sexiest Halloween costumes he wants to see her wearing? *wink*. 


7.  Jeff talks to Gypsy about the Facebook groups and finding information of certain people posting. He feels her obsessed autistic fan is likely harmless, but weirdly obsessed with her. He suggests not giving him attention. He says he understands she doesn‚Äôt want to be mean, but he‚Äôs an odd guy. Jeff says he found a picture of a private message this man sent to someone, has sent it to Gypsy and it reminded Jeff of a certain someone Gypsy used to talk to. (I‚Äôm assuming insinuating Nick) Gypsy then starts talking about Covid and being sexual again. 


8.  Gypsy tells Jeff she never took him off being her SO, she didn‚Äôt wanna take it off until it was absolutely clear they wouldn‚Äôt be together. She appreciates Jeff helping her rally up support, she‚Äôs going to contact her aunt to write a letter in her behalf, she feels bad for asking, it would mean a lot coming from her. She knows her cousin will write one too. Gypsy tells Jeff the autistic guy sent her a message, saying people in the group think he‚Äôs too obsessive and creepy. She doesn‚Äôt wanna be mean to him and needs advice to maybe tell him to lay off the groups for a bit. She wants Jeff to change his fb status so girls know he‚Äôs taken. Gypsy asks Jeff what his favorite scary movie is. She then says, ‚ÄúOh and what's your favorite candy? and no, me as ""Candy"" doesn't count lol maybe....:-P‚Äù 


9.  Gypsy tells Jeff she wants to experience things. She talks about zip lining.. camping.. she wants to have a fire and eat out of tin cans. She hates bugs, so if she feels something crawling up her leg it better be him trying to be frisky! Gypsy gets a necklace from Jeff. She tells Jeff that‚Äôs the first piece of jewelry a man has ever given her. Gypsy then gives him a detailed description of the type of ring and size she is just in case. 


10.  Gypsy tells Jeff to not overthink tonight about what she told him about her dark thoughts. This is why she needs therapy. Most of her thoughts are good and hopeful for the future, other times she‚Äôs needs to be talked back. She needs Jeff to keep reminding her to stay strong. When life gets overwhelming for her in prison, Jeff saves her, so why wouldn‚Äôt he when she‚Äôs home. Gypsy gets upset with the warden and caseworker because video visits don‚Äôt work yet. They tell her to write to another official. Then Gypsy gets mad because where the fuck is her new tablet!? It‚Äôs been a month since she bought it. She sent 46 ecards and none of them sent, a wasted $23. She misses Jeff but the phones suck and she can‚Äôt really hear him due to the static. She left crying, today was too much for her. It was a ‚Äúlocked out of the bathroom‚Äù day. She had a gift sent to Jeff but it hasn‚Äôt arrived so if it doesn‚Äôt get there by a certain time she‚Äôll have to get a refund which is making her really upset wanting to cry because now she doesn‚Äôt have a gift to give him for Christmas. She just hates where she is. She hates that she can‚Äôt control anything. She hates that she‚Äôs at the mercy of her limitations. 


11.  Gypsy says she got a call from the BACA, saying they are reconsidering her case just a day after she sent them those 5 reasons arguing against their decision. (I‚Äôm almost certain this is a lie. If anyone can find an email of the woman saying this, let me know. But the BACA was firm on their decision.) 


12.  Gypsy tells Jeff that she wants to see the ocean, touch trees in a forest, feel the rain in a thunderstorm, walk through a meadow of flowers, she wants to go dancing in a night club wearing next to nothing in a skin tight dress, she wants to take pole dancing lessons. She wants to learn to ice skate like the pros she used to watch when she was 8 on tv. She wants to eat chocolate cherries while watching GoT, Outlander, Salem and True Blood. She wants to at least once get it on in a public place. She wants to go to a space and get that green stuff on her face, also get her peach waxed. She wants to visit Cali and go on the TMZ celebrity bus tour. It‚Äôs Jeff‚Äôs birthday so of course Gypsy is really laying into how great of a person Jeff is by bringing herself up. He‚Äôs passionate about *her* and not afraid to go after what he wants .. *her* 


13.  Gypsy describes her anxious mind as ‚Äúthe box, she tells Jeff that she was going to send an email reassuring him that none of her friends will expose or intrude on their privacy. Then the email turned into her being an embarrassment to him and that she‚Äôs worthless trash because of her past. She went down a rabbit hole of insecurity about what if her relationship is exposed and the aftermath of that atomic bomb. (Yeah, because she‚Äôs also dating almost marrying Ryan at this point lmao so of course she‚Äôs worried). She then tells Jeff she doesn‚Äôt want him to shout that he‚Äôs dating GYPSY ROSE BLANCHARD! But he could tell his friends if he wants to. Gypsy talks about pretty much being a cat on his lap.  


14.  Regarding BACA, Jeff tells Gypsy he suggests Gypsy gets her certificates back from the woman who helped her and move  on. He has looked in finding a number for BACA, so he can figure out what they know about this lady and Gypsy‚Äôs situation. Gypsy tells Jeff she‚Äôs thankful he can lead her into the right direction and calling her out when she‚Äôs not being true to herself. Even tho they cleared everything up, it‚Äôs still bothering her of what Jeff said about her birthday money he sent last year. She feels that comment was WAY out of line and hurt her. Jeff didn‚Äôt apologize. He can‚Äôt just say things like that and it all be better overnight. Maybe HE needs to think before he speaks. She didn‚Äôt fight for their relationship for a few extra bucks in her account. She‚Äôs done with it, he needs to give her time to get over it. (Sorry but this sounds identical to what he did to her, she‚Äôs just bringing up something petty to punish him) . She tells him that if he does correct her in person, he better make her feel better after because she will pout until he does. 


15.  Jeff tells Gypsy he‚Äôs been thinking about how to approach her about Brazilian guy. He just wants what‚Äôs best for her. He says he knows she‚Äôs not being influenced with positive thoughts and ideas from the other women in prison. He tells her that at least she‚Äôll be able to sleep at night knowing she did the right thing. Don‚Äôt get caught up in their shit, they will egg her on to do the wrong thing because it makes them feel better to bring Gypsy down to their level. Let them scam however they want, they have to live with it. Just because they have a nice pair of sneakers and a locker full of ramen and coffee doesn‚Äôt get them anything more than a temporary bandaid on the fact they‚Äôre a shitty person. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a product of your environment, make your environment a product do you‚Äù. He KNOWS she‚Äôs a good person. She just had a lapse of judgment. He wants Gypsy focusing on having the best life possible. Gypsy said she was inspired to make her first doll with Covid! Her name will be ‚ÄúCorona Monna‚Äù, each doll will have a positive Covid test and mask accessory. Doll will be sold stores.. never! 


16.  Gypsy tells Jeff, ‚ÄúIf I could right now I would come home, take a hot shower together, get in our pajamas and I would have you lay your head back on my chest while I give you a massage and a few upside down kisses. *gives you a few pecks* I can never tell you enough, I love you.‚Äù. Gypsy says she feels how Jeff feels. She‚Äôs felt his anxiety and wanted to voice to him that she feels these things. So instead of him saying all is well, he can talk to her. She wants to know how he really is because she cares. She says she‚Äôs useless when it comes to boat knowledge, but she is good company as a relaxer. She‚Äôs funny, quirky and kinda sexy.

Just wondering‚Ä¶ are there other Somali professionals in the UK (mid 20s-30s) who feel like me sometimes?
You know, outside of work/ family it‚Äôs kind of hard to find people that actually care about their deen,want to grow professionally but also just want to chill and have fun in a halal way.

 I‚Äôve been thinking it‚Äôd be cool to have a small community where we could: hang out and make proper friendships, join segregated events (both online + in person) and play board games, coffee catch ups, hikes, support each other whilst balancing career/deen:life. 

Just to be clear: the main focus is to make friends and build a community and if some people are interested then have an optional halal matching thing but that‚Äôs way down the line and not the aim of the group. 

So yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm curious does this sound like something you‚Äôd actually join?

1n6061e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1n6061e/am_i_expecting_too_much_from_art_class/,Am I expecting too much from art class?,"I signed my kids (11, 5) up for an art class at our local community center. The class was described as follows: ""Children will be taught artistic concepts such as proportion, color theory, the ascetics of symmetry, and more. The teacher will expose them to various mediums, including pastels and watercolors."" The description also said that kids will be taught introductory art history and will get opportunities to replicate famous works of art, such as painting their own self portrait, Picasso style. I paid $300 per child for 7 classes, each class being 1.5 hours long. 

Our community center has a wing that has classrooms/a gym, and then another wing with a public library. I will usually go to the library while my kids are in the class and return to the classroom area 15-20 minutes before class ends. Today the library was closed, so I dropped the kids off, went to get a coffee, and then went to sit in front of the classroom while I waited. These classrooms have floor to ceiling glass walls, so you can see what's going on inside the whole time. The kids were coloring on printer paper using markers and the teacher was on her phone. 2 out of 4 of the kids were the teacher's children, and they were goofing off with each other, getting up from their chairs and walking around the room, and speaking to the teacher about non-class related things (which I could hear because they were being loud). To be clear, I don't care that she has her kids in the class with her, I actually think it's great. But I wouldn't let my kids behave like that in a class setting, regardless of who the teacher is. 

I haven't observed past classes and this is their third* one. They've come home with 2 paintings so far, one water colored and one acrylic. I don't want to bring this up to my son because I don't want to (no pun intended) ""paint"" the teacher in a negative light to him, but I did ask him if he's learned any of the concepts mentioned in the class description, or emulated the works of any famous painters, and he said no. 

I guess my question is, would you be disappointed? 

Edited to add: my kids ask her after each class what they will be doing next class, and apparently today she said ""I don't know, don't rush me"" and laughed. ",14,1756759383.0,Parenting,31,1.0,False

1n601gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1n601gq/should_i_end_my_friendship_over_my_friend/,Should I end my friendship over my friend stealing my tripod head and befriending a married cheater?!,"
I (30F) have a friend, let‚Äôs call her Zee (27F). We‚Äôve been friends for about a year and a half, but today, after reading another Reddit post, I started questioning whether I actually trust her.

The first fuchsia flag happened about six months ago. I was working over the weekend at the office, and Zee came along to hang out and even helped me with some tasks. My tasks included shooting videos and taking photos, so I had my tripod with me.

At the end of the day, while I was packing up to leave, I realized the head of my tripod (that I had just been using) was suddenly missing. I started looking everywhere because I still needed it that night for more work. Zee even helped me look for it and checked her bag, but said it wasn‚Äôt there.

Here‚Äôs the thing: a week or two before this, she had mentioned that she lost the head of her own tripod, and hers is the same model as mine. That thought didn‚Äôt really cross my mind then though, since I was focused on finding my tripod head.

We eventually left the office without it. Then later, when she was rummaging through her bag for something else, the tripod head fell out. I played it casual, saying something like, ‚ÄúOh, you must not have seen it the first time! Girl, you really need some coffee.‚Äù But in the back of my mind, I wondered if she had actually taken it on purpose, since hers was missing. I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt, but I also made a mental note to be cautious and see how she acts over time.

Then came another red flag. Around the same time, Zee made a work friend, let‚Äôs call him Poo (30M). 

He‚Äôs married, has a 3-month-old baby, and cheats on his wife all the time. He even flirts with Zee, though she only thinks of him as a friend. But Poo's wife has no idea Zee even exists.

I told Zee this guy is bad news. This hidden friendship is not only unfair to his wife, but also potentially dangerous for her. If he‚Äôs this terrible of a husband, he could just as easily treat her badly too. He could spread rumors about her at work, drag her into drama, or worse. I told her she should keep her distance for her own sake.

But Zee doesn‚Äôt see it that way. She insists his choices are his responsibility and says that as long as she isn‚Äôt directly doing anything wrong, she doesn‚Äôt care if he hides their friendship from his wife.

So now I‚Äôm left wondering. Am I overreacting for thinking these are red flags? 

To me, the fact that she doesn‚Äôt care about this wife‚Äôs feelings makes me worry she also wouldn‚Äôt care about mine. Maybe she doesn‚Äôt care about people‚Äôs feelings in general, which could mean she‚Äôd be careless with me and wouldn‚Äôt mind hurting me in the future if we don‚Äôt see eye to eye.

So, is my worry about trusting her valid? Or am I reading too much into this?",3,1756759090.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

Ive been working in this office for my social service since February. It has been really nice working here. The people are very friendly, funny and just a joy to be around. This office has psychology and design interns. We are 3 design interns (all girls) and quite a few psych interns.

So  me, the design girls and one psychology guy became friends.

We clicked instantly and we went out for coffee breaks, we went for lunch, we chatted while we worked, etc.

Everything was ok until HR came to us and said that this one girl is feeling excluded from us. But the thing is that she never came to us and tried to hang out. Every time I would see her, she would have her headphones on and her eyes glued to her laptop.

After this, I tried to get along with her. I would ask her if she wanted to grab coffee with me and I would talk to her more often. But she made things weird and uncomfortable really fast.

One time I saw that she was reading something on her laptop and I asked her what was she reading. She told me she was reading about this king and his sexuality. Cool whatever, everyone has their interests. But the thing is she started showing me and telling me about the topic. She went on extreme detail. I was so uncomfortable but she kept talking.  HR had to step in and say that this was inappropriate for a work environment.

My guy friend told me that he got paired to work together and she started stalking one of his patients on social media. My friend said that she kept talking about how she found him hot.

After a while and many encounters like this, we went to HR. She told us that there have been many complaints about her and that they were gonna let her go.

Everything was great until now. After my social service I wanted to stay in the office to keep going as an intern. But apparently this girl went to the school, told them that we treated her badly, had her father come to the office and complain about us.  She complaint to the director and to the system that places students in internships and social services.

Now I can't apply for an internship here. Ive poured so much of my hard work and effort on this place. HR even told me that they wanted me to stay. I've done so much and I wanted to stay to maybe even get hired as an actual employee in the future. But because of this girl I can't, or my other option is quit the intern seminary and re take the course next semester. But that includes a lot more than just look for an other option.

I'm just venting rn. I know life is not fair and that they really appreciate me. I'm just so mad.",3,1756759025.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.81,False

**Cat Grant‚Äôs Apartment, Metropolis**

---

Clark had been going nonstop since Jimmy went missing. The only lead was the sudden appearance of Lex Luthor‚Äôs previously unknown son. Old LexCorp robotic prototypes were connected to the abduction, and then a new Lex Luthor emerges from the woodwork and becomes CEO? It seemed like there had to be a connection.

Lois spent most of her time researching the new Lex, but so far, everything checked out with him. He was born to Dr. Gretchen Kelley in Australia. She joked that at least it meant he couldn‚Äôt run for president like his father. His background was there, though. Legal documents, social media history, and he even passed a DNA test to confirm his lineage. But when it came to the Luthors, especially those named Lex, neither Lois nor Clark wanted to treat them lightly.

But still, time moved forward, and Clark had other duties. Namely, he was scheduled to interview Cat Grant about her involvement with the takedown of Morgan Edge, the head of Intergang, nearly two years ago. He was still imprisoned, and there were talks of early parole, which was ludicrous for the severity of his crimes. Edge had been found guilty, but he was still well-connected. The fact that parole was even considered, especially this early, showed he had friends in high places.

It couldn‚Äôt be allowed. It was the duty of the press to bring such corruption into the view of the public. The Daily Planet couldn‚Äôt just let Edge‚Äôs past get swept under the rug. They couldn‚Äôt stop Lex Sr. from having charges dropped against him, and look how that turned out.

‚ÄúThanks for seeing me,‚Äù said Clark as Cat led him to the couch.

The room was a bit messy. Clothes were draped over the furniture, and papers were stacked over the coffee table. A photo of a boy in a football uniform on the side table caught Clark‚Äôs eye. ‚ÄúIs that Adam?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs growing up so fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Cat smiled. ‚ÄúYou must be feeling that with your little ones, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúDefinitely,‚Äù Clark nodded.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs Lois?‚Äù Cat asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised she wasn‚Äôt the one to reach out for this interview. I thought she let go of her grudges against me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing like that,‚Äù Clark explained. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs buried in the LexCorp shakeup. You know how she puts everything into a story once she‚Äôs invested, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I know,‚Äù Cat replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the same way,‚Äù she motioned toward the papers on the coffee table. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see who gets the juicier details first, though.‚Äù

Of course, Cat was also investigating LexCorp. Between Lex II‚Äôs appearance and the recent robotic attacks, it was at the center of the public eye.

‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not here to talk about the Luthors,‚Äù Cat continued. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want to share too much. I imagine you‚Äôd convey anything you learn from me with Lois. And your wife is known for her scoops.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Clark agreed. ‚ÄúSo, Morgan Edge‚Ä¶‚Äù

**Daily Planet**

*Later*

‚ÄúShe said what?‚Äù Lois asked as Clark relayed how his conversation with Cat went. ‚ÄúThe nerve of that woman, acting like I‚Äôm still harboring a grudge.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think she was just teasing,‚Äù said Clark, handing her a cup of coffee. A Planet News Caf√© logo was printed on the side. ‚ÄúShe was the one who patched things up, remember?‚Äù

‚Äú*Sure,*‚Äù Lois replied dryly, taking a sip. ‚Äú*Mmm*,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúEddie really makes the best coffee. How‚Äôs his wife?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs good,‚Äù Clark said. ‚ÄúGoing back to school, actually.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great,‚Äù Lois replied, turning her attention to her computer.

‚ÄúYou never really told me what happened between you and Cat,‚Äù said Clark, drawing her attention back. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been married for six years, I think I can handle it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ancient history, Clark,‚Äù said Lois. ‚ÄúWe have more important things to worry about now.‚Äù

Perry White huffed as he stopped at their desks. ‚ÄúAre you watching GBS?‚Äù he asked.

Lois and Clark each raised an eyebrow simultaneously.

‚ÄúDid Cat mention our interview?‚Äù asked Clark as Lois brought up the live feed.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, Smallville,‚Äù said Lois, nudging her husband over to her side. Perry stood there too as they watched someone other than Cat Grant anchoring that evening. ‚ÄúWhy is Angela Chen filling in?‚Äù Lois wondered.

‚ÄúA colleague over there told me Cat never showed up,‚Äù Perry explained. ‚ÄúWas there something wrong with her at your interview?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, she seemed fine,‚Äù said Clark. ‚ÄúShe was looking into LexCorp, same as us.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd same as every other news agency,‚Äù Lois added.

‚ÄúDo you think she could have been taken, too?‚Äù Clark asked.

‚ÄúFirst Olsen, now Cat,‚Äù Perry stated, ‚ÄúCould someone be going after the press?‚Äù

**Cat Grant‚Äôs Apartment**

*Later*

Adam Grant opened the door to the apartment to let Lois and Clark enter.

‚ÄúWhen‚Äôs the last time you saw your mother?‚Äù Lois asked the teenager bluntly.

‚Äú*Um, I don‚Äôt know*,‚Äù the boy stammered. ‚ÄúThis morning before school,‚Äù he finally confirmed. ‚ÄúIs she okay?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt show up for work,‚Äù Lois dropped.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Clark added, a soft reassurance in his voice. ‚ÄúBut we are concerned. Do you know any reason she may have skipped work?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot that I can think of,‚Äù Adam replied. ‚ÄúBut she never does that. Not even for one of my games.‚Äù

Lois sat on the couch and shuffled through the papers, still scattered on the coffee table. ‚ÄúShe was chasing something big. There‚Äôs a lot on LexCorp here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think that new Lex Luthor kidnapped her or something?‚Äù asked Adam, his eyebrows widened as high as they would go.

‚ÄúIf she disappeared after this level of research into them,‚Äù Lois answered, her head still buried in papers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôd be a coincidence for it not to be related.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really know anything for sure,‚Äù Clark clarified. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just hoping to find some clues to make sense of what happened to her.‚Äù

‚Äú*Hmm*,‚Äù said Lois, scanning a few pieces of paper in particular. ‚ÄúShe was looking into old LexCorp patents for robotics. Why didn‚Äôt I think of that?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnything helpful?‚Äù Clark asked, sitting down next to her.

‚ÄúNothing that stands out,‚Äù Lois replied. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs a lot here.‚Äù She started piling up the documents.

Adam cleared his throat.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind if we take these with us to review, do you?‚Äù asked Clark.

‚ÄúI guess not,‚Äù Adam shrugged. ‚ÄúBut Mom will probably be furious.‚Äù

###Buried Secrets

**Kent House**

*That Night*

---

Lois continued reviewing Cat‚Äôs research once the kids were put to bed and Clark was out searching for their missing friends. Ever since they patched things up, Lois and Cat were never as close as they had been years ago. But it didn‚Äôt mean Lois wanted anything bad to happen to her.

They‚Äôve known each other since they were teenagers, having both joined an experimental program at the Daily Planet to help train future reporters. It felt like a lifetime ago, chasing stories together and reporting to Perry White himself. Things fell apart quickly when Perry‚Äôs son Richard joined the team.

It was a shame. Lois and Cat could have been great friends if things hadn‚Äôt fallen apart. Lois was even developing a newfound respect while reviewing her research. The way she color-coded her post-its and string to connect them together made it easier to track patterns.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so important about these patent addresses, Cat?‚Äù Lois muttered to herself, tossing several of the blue post-its to the side.

One yellow note caught Lois‚Äôs eye. *Remember to confirm Adam‚Äôs schedule*. Even with her deep focus on her work, Cat made a conscious effort to balance her responsibilities as a mother. Lois could relate. And maybe learn a thing or two from a more experienced working mother like her.

A blue post-it note screamed for Lois‚Äôs attention with its address circled several times. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt fit,‚Äù Lois said aloud.

Most patent addresses were tied to LexCorp or its subsidiaries, but that one stood out. *Underground Maintenance Station*. Why would a LexCorp patent robotic tech through a utility tunnel?

It was worth a look.

Lois grabbed her keys from her desk, but stopped herself halfway to the door of the home office.

‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù she said under her breath. ‚ÄúA good working mother still can‚Äôt leave her kids home alone.‚Äù

She pulled out her phone and dialed up Clark.

‚ÄúLois, did you find anything?‚Äù Clark asked when we picked up.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Lois replied, her eyes still locked on the circled post-it note. ‚ÄúThis stinks of LexCorp more and more.‚Äù

**Underground Maintenance Station, Suicide Slum**

*Soon*

---

Clark entered the utility tunnel, which was eerily quiet, except for a steady drip from one of the overhead pipes. Nothing there suggested a link to robotics or the recent abduction. Or abductions, if Cat had been taken like Jimmy.

His x-ray vision didn‚Äôt pick up anything behind the walls, the lead in them making it hard to see through. So, Clark focused his hearing instead, trying to pick up any heartbeats, but nobody was there.

Clark let out an exasperated sigh. It didn‚Äôt matter if there was nothing there connected to LexCorp. The main priority was finding his friends.

A soft metallic scrape caught his ear, followed by a faint whisper, and he swung around.

Nothing.

Well, maybe someone wanted him to think it was nothing.

Clark‚Äôs eyes moved to some wiring visible along the wall. It stood out because of how clean it was compared to the grimy coating around everything else. He heard what sounded like a motor kicking on, but couldn‚Äôt pinpoint the source. And then several more followed along.

Another metallic scrape with no source echoed in the station. Several more whispers followed.

‚ÄúEnough games,‚Äù said Clark. ‚ÄúShow yourselves.‚Äù

The surrounding walls popped down, and a swarm of robots charged toward him. They resembled the ones that crashed LexCorp‚Äôs gala and attacked him at the site of Jimmy‚Äôs disappearance.

Clark fired off a wide burst of heat vision, toppling a handful of them in front, but the ones from the other sides already reached him, throwing punches and shooting energy blasts his way. He ducked what he could, but was taking on damage. 

The whispering continued, and he could finally make out one of them saying, ‚ÄúJiiiiiimmmmmy‚Ä¶ Where‚Äôs Jiiiiiiiiimmmmmmmy?‚Äù

The robots were *taunting* him.

Clark spun around rapidly, loosening the grip of the robots trying to pin him down. He proceeded to grab one, but his hand went right through it, beams of light fizzling on impact.

‚ÄúHolograms?‚Äù Clark asked aloud before another one punched him. He grabbed that one, which was real, and smashed it against many of the others, breaking them apart.

As he worked his way through the rest, he noticed that the robotic debris on the ground had an odd smell to it. On a closer look, it appeared like some fibrous stands, maybe muscle, had been grafted onto the metal.

The taunts, the holograms, and the use of biotech seemed to indicate someone was making upgrades. But who?

Clark fought his way through the rest of the attackers, using his strength and heat vision to take them all out of commission. He leaned down to take a sample of the enhanced machinery, but they suddenly started bubbling and melting away into a foul, blackish sludge.

It was clear that whoever designed them didn‚Äôt want any evidence left behind. But what was their purpose? What could motivate someone to make robots like that? And, most of all, why take Jimmy Olsen and Cat Grant?

**LexCorp Tower**

*Next Morning*

---

Lex Luthor II‚Äôs executive assistant, Ani Jessop, a petite woman with short brown hair, escorted Lois and Clark into a conference room opposite the new CEO‚Äôs office in the penthouse of LexCorp Tower. That part of the floor was previously Lex Sr.‚Äôs living quarters. He never felt the need to live anywhere but in his building. It seemed that his newfound son saw life differently, having recently purchased a modern, glass-walled penthouse on the waterfront of Midtown.

Another noticeable change was that Jr. held this interview in a conference room rather than his office. Lex Sr. generally conducted all his business from there. He liked to be at the center of the conversation.

As Lois and Clark took their seats, Lena walked in, greeting them, quickly followed by her half-brother. The new heir to LexCorp couldn‚Äôt be more different than his late father. The young man had a head full of reddish hair and a beard just as thick.

‚ÄúThanks for seeing us on such short notice,‚Äù said Clark, extending his hand. ‚ÄúI know you must be busy learning the ropes.‚Äù

Lex accepted the handshake vigorously. ‚ÄúOf course, mate,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúHappy to help. My new sister here has told me a lot about you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly good things, I hope,‚Äù Lois said with a snap.

‚ÄúAll good, promise,‚Äù Lex replied. I just had to meet you in person and see how I could help with your investigations.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already told the police everything,‚Äù Lena chimed in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what else we can offer, though, but we‚Äôll try.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you had any contact with Cat Grant, Mr. Luthor?‚Äù Lois jumped right in before Lex had a chance to sit.

Clark caught a flicker of hesitation on the man‚Äôs face. The question had caught him off guard.

‚ÄúLex, please,‚Äù he stated. And never met the woman, truth be told,‚Äù he confirmed.

‚ÄúWhat does she have to do with anything?‚Äù Lena asked, tilting her head a bit.

‚ÄúWe believe she may be second in a series of abductions among the press,‚Äù Clark explained.

‚ÄúShe was abducted?‚Äù Lex asked, his surprise appearing genuine. There was a pause before he continued. More hesitation? ‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt heard.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not official yet,‚Äù said Lois. ‚ÄúHave you been looking into your father‚Äôs patents with robotics, Lex?‚Äù Lois veered quickly.

‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù said Lex. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been quite clear about that with the police and the press already.‚Äù

‚ÄúLexCorp holds a considerable amount of patents,‚Äù Lena added. ‚ÄúA great deal of them get archived and never see the light of day.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Clark agreed. ‚ÄúBut someone‚Äôs been digging into those archives, continuing to experiment with the designs.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh-what?‚Äù Lex asked, clearly taken aback. He turned to his sister.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt heard of anything like that,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYou will soon,‚Äù said Lois. ‚ÄúSuperman fought more of the robots there. Only this time, they were upgraded.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Lex. ‚ÄúThis explains the rush to have this interview. I can see your reputations as hotshot journalists haven‚Äôt been embellished.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf LexCorp has no connection to whoever is designing these machines,‚Äù said Clark. ‚ÄúWho else could be?‚Äù

Lex stood up, Lena following his example.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve already told you everything I know,‚Äù said Lex. ‚ÄúBut, rest assured, we‚Äôll dig into these new revelations at once. You have my word.‚Äù He moved toward the door. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôll excuse me, I have other business.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks for setting this up,‚Äù said Clark as Lena started following him.

‚ÄúUh, yeah, sure,‚Äù she replied.

‚ÄúPlease show them out,‚Äù Lena ordered Jessop.

‚ÄúWe rattled him,‚Äù Lois whispered to her husband. ‚ÄúBut is he rattled because he‚Äôs involved or because he has no idea what‚Äôs happening?‚Äù
###Targets

**Near the Daily Planet**

*Later*

---

Lois and Clark exited their SUV and walked toward the Planet News Caf√©.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs our next move?‚Äù Clark asked. ‚ÄúThe robots‚Äô self-destruction didn‚Äôt leave us with much.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone must have been there at the utility tunnel,‚Äù Lois answered. ‚ÄúIf we can find out who, that‚Äôd be the break we needed.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood idea,‚Äù said Clark, opening the door to the cafe for Lois. ‚ÄúWe could canvass for possible witnesses around the entryway to the subway.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd there could be some CCTV coverage in the area,‚Äù Lois added, walking inside.

A young girl greeted them from the counter. ‚ÄúHi, what can I get for you today?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù Clark returned. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Eddie today?‚Äù

The unfamiliar barista blinked. ‚ÄúHe missed his shift,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe was supposed to train me, too, so please forgive me if I‚Äôm a little slow with your order.‚Äù

Lois sighed, but Clark reassured the girl. ‚ÄúNo worries,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not like him, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, the manager told me he‚Äôs never missed a shift before,‚Äù the barista explained.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think‚Äì‚Äù Clark started.

‚ÄúNo, why would anyone take Eddie?‚Äù Lois interrupted, turning back to the counter. ‚ÄúLarge black for me,‚Äù she ordered. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll have a medium latte with extra sugar, extra sweetened cream, and a few pumps of chocolate syrup.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot a sweet tooth, huh?‚Äù the girl chuckled.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know the half of it,‚Äù said Lois.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs add in a couple of coffeecake muffins, too,‚Äù said Clark.

‚ÄúComing right up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope Eddie‚Äôs okay,‚Äù said Clark. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound like him to skirt his job.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt *really* isn‚Äôt like him,‚Äù Lois continued, her eyes narrowing to make the connection. ‚ÄúHis wife, Vera, is going back to school? He wouldn‚Äôt jeopardize his job, especially not now.‚Äù

Clark took Lois to the side as the barista worked on their coffee order. ‚ÄúCould this be connected to Jimmy and Cat?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúIf so,‚Äù Lois started. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about the press. It could be about you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe?‚Äù Clark asked.

‚ÄúJimmy‚Äôs your best friend,‚Äù said Lois. ‚ÄúYou had just interviewed Cat. And now Eddie.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know Eddie is missing, let alone abducted,‚Äù Clark said quietly.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know he wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù Lois stated bluntly. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Lois called across the counter.

The barista was startled at the interruption as some of the coffee spilled from the cup she was carrying. ‚ÄúUh, yeah?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúDo you have Eddie‚Äôs number?‚Äù

**Daily Planet**

*Moments Later*

---

‚ÄúKenny Braverman went after people connected to you before,‚Äù said Lois, as she and Clark exited the elevator to the bullpen.

People were shuffling all around. Not quite that unusual for the Planet, but there was a wave of uneasiness to the commotion.

‚ÄúThat was my first thought, too,‚Äù said Clark. ‚ÄúBut Kenny‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you want to give the new Lex the benefit of the doubt,‚Äù Lois started. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs too close to this. If he knows what his father knew about you..?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible,‚Äù said Clark. ‚ÄúThe whole Lex Jr. situation does feel‚Ä¶ off somehow. Either way, I'd better call in some help to watch over Ma and Pa.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen Mr. White?‚Äù Ron Troupe asked as he approached. ‚ÄúHe never showed up today.‚Äù

Lois and Clark dropped their coffees on their desks. They nodded before Clark picked up his phone as Lois marched toward Perry‚Äôs office.

‚ÄúNo answer,‚Äù said Clark.

‚ÄúHis door‚Äôs locked,‚Äù said Lois.

Clark met Lois at the door and turned the handle until it crunched, and the door swung open.

Papers and desk supplies littered the room, and Perry‚Äôs chair was knocked over.

‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt just a break-in,‚Äù said Clark. ‚ÄúThere was a struggle.‚Äù He studied the room with his super senses, looking for any more clues.

Lois pointed to the window, its glass broken through, with tiny shards embedded in the carpet below it.

‚ÄúNot Perry, too,‚Äù said Clark.

Lois‚Äôs face scrunched into a scowl. ‚ÄúWe need to get to the bottom of this *now*.‚Äù

---

**Elsewhere**

---

In a dimly lit room with tables full of electronics and several monitors clumped together on a desk, a man watched as Superman fought the robots. He was holding a robotic arm with a skin-like covering over part of it.

In the corner of the room, there was a jail cell made from old, rusted iron. Inside were four people, three sitting on the floor, while an older man was unconscious next to them.

‚ÄúHey, ugly,‚Äù the youngest of the group called. ‚ÄúYour robots will never stop Superman. You might as well give up before he finds us.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Olsen,‚Äù the man started. ‚ÄúThese are just test runs. The best is yet to come.‚Äù

The unconscious man started to stir. ‚ÄúChief!‚Äù Jimmy exclaimed. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

The others helped him sit up as the Daily Planet editor-in-chief took in his surroundings.

‚ÄúJimmy, Cat, and‚Ä¶ Eddie from the coffeeshop?‚Äù said Perry, recognizing his fellow prisoners. ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all close to someone who did me a great disservice, once upon a time,‚Äù the captor explained from his chair. ‚ÄúI let it go all those years ago. Now‚Äôs the time to strike back.‚Äù

‚ÄúJimmy,‚Äù said Perry, softly, drawing in a hopeful grin. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me ‚ÄòChief.‚Äù

1n5zyoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1n5zyoe/everything_can_change_in_a_week/,Everything can change in a week,"Okay, so this is a bit of a doozy.

My partner and I recently moved out, we had been living together in a kind of duplex with my parents, but we‚Äôd been working towards getting our own place for obvious reasons. We had multiple talks about where to go, I wanted to leave the country, he wanted to be near his family. I love him entirely and decided with the reasons I had for wanting to leave, it would make sense for me to give that up for him. 

He had been having a stressful time for multiple reasons and wanted to visit his family, we‚Äôd been in a rough patch (he had broken some trust and we were working on rebuilding that) but as stated above; I love him. He can be really stupid, he can be very inexperienced, but I never doubt that the things he does are because he didn‚Äôt think about it right rather than malice or weaponized incompetence or anything. So we went. 

Since we‚Äôd been talking about moving we looked at houses while we were staying at his parents place, which was exhausting let me tell you, and on the way to one of the houses we found a kitten. She was sitting in the road right in our path, I grabbed her and we took her to the vet and everything you do with a new kitten. She‚Äôs resting peacefully on my stomach as I type this. Finding her, however, changed things. We went from looking for houses to needing a place to stay so we could keep her. His parents don‚Äôt like cats, and only begrudgingly let her stay and only in the room we were staying in. One of my parents is very very allergic. So we had nowhere to go.

We ended up apartment hunting and finding this really nice one about 15 minutes from his family. It basically had everything we wanted, so we decided to give up distance. That was a mistake. 

To get to the crux of the issue; my partner is bilingual, his family primarily speaks another language. I‚Äôm learning it but it‚Äôs slow, I‚Äôm still barely conversational. His older sister initially had an issue with me, I didn‚Äôt know what it was, but the first time I visited with my partner it was very obvious to me that she didn‚Äôt like me. I chalked it up to her not knowing me yet, and I‚Äôm dating her brother so she was probably protective. 

She has a young daughter who I adore (she‚Äôs so cute) and we got a long which seemed to mellow out the sister with me, or so I thought. This all happened before he moved to live with me about a year ago. Time passes, all seems well, then we move back. 

We stay at his parents for about a week, we had only planned a few days but then aforementioned kitty showed up. During that time I notice the older sister exclusively talking in the language I don‚Äôt know around me. She is bilingual and speaks more English in front of her parents who are less fluent in English, than in front of me. I‚Äôm talking it‚Äôs glaring how much she‚Äôs excluding me. She used to do it on the phone if I was there, which I wasn‚Äôt bothered by because I figured she just wanted to talk to her brother, but now it‚Äôs a conversation about our cat with me right there, or something involving what we‚Äôre going to do. She speaks English to her daughter as well. Not me. 

Obviously this makes me a really sad, because I thought we were getting along better. Honestly I also kind of thought I‚Äôd get some brownie points for moving back with him. I knew they missed him and I figured maybe anything feeling like I was ‚Äútaking him away‚Äù would abate once he was around again. Boy was I wrong. 

I‚Äôm sad, my partner didn‚Äôt even notice until I bring it up but then he‚Äôs angry. (I asked him to look out for it so I could check if I was just being insecure or something, and he saw it too) he wants to set a hard boundary, but I convince him to try and figure out why it‚Äôs happening first. My whole goal has been trying to have a good relationship with his family so he can. 

He has told me this whole time that he wants to be the one to handle his family, so I let him, it‚Äôs his family. I do coach him a little on how to be less aggressive with it, because I don‚Äôt want to accuse her of anything I just wanted to get to the root of the issue. Unfortunately on his call with her he asks her to speak more English around me (which I wouldn‚Äôt have asked her because it doesn‚Äôt really solve the issue, and if she‚Äôs going to hate me I‚Äôd rather her do it in the open tbh). 

This is where it all goes downhill. 

She goes and cries to their parents and they ream my partner out for being racist to his sister. Yes they framed him asking her to include me as being racist. Which honestly I could have guessed which was also why I wouldn‚Äôt have asked that of her. 

We go over for a dinner and are iced out by nearly everyone, my partner finally gets how it‚Äôs felt to be me in his home. (Most of the visit I‚Äôve been doing my best to translate in my head what I can and use context clues. He translated for me very little, which to a certain extent I encouraged because I wanted him to have time with his family without worrying about me) The issue being‚Ä¶ he hasn‚Äôt been himself. 

Maybe anyone with a brain could have told me this would happen, but I didn‚Äôt realize how deeply toxic his family structure really was. We came back and they sucked him back in. He was there with me, but it was like everything he had learned about me, all our little supports we give eachother throughout the day, gone. I have some physical issues and a very low social battery. I knew going in I‚Äôd have to mask both because his family is a very‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre the type that don‚Äôt believe in therapy and think you just gotta work harder to get through it. So I knew I couldn‚Äôt be open about my struggles, I just had to deal with them the best I could. What I didn‚Äôt realize is that I would be doing that alone with my partner switching to encouraging me to do the things damaging to my body and mind for his family. 

Over and over I have to point out little things. Like one day he agreed to field his family for a night so I could recharge, then 20 minutes later is asking me if I could just come out to eat all together for a little bit. And it‚Äôs fucking awful because I always feel so guilty for my limitations, and here‚Äôs the person I love the most telling me that they‚Äôre an issue. And it‚Äôs like he realizes it in the moment but then is back in a haze. He‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ not there. Not the man I fell in love with. 

I want it to be understood that I didn‚Äôt fully get what was going on at the time, everything was so stressful and I was always tired and my brain-fog was at an all time high. I just wanted to get through our tasks. 
1. Find a place
2. Move in
3. Get furniture 
So we moved in to our new apartment.

Then the stuff with his sister happened, I tried to set up a time to talk. I asked her to talk one on one. She immediately sends my partner a text saying basically ‚Äúwhat did I do wrong now?‚Äù Immediately in victim mentality. I try setting things up with her for a few days, she takes forever to respond while responding to my partner fine. Okay, sure. Then she pretends to be sick. To get out of it. I‚Äôm talking like 3rd grader doesn‚Äôt know what it sounds like to have a bad cough and is overdoing it sick. After saying goodbye on the phone call she literally waits to cough three more times before hanging up. She‚Äôs 28. And has a daughter. Don‚Äôt worry all I‚Äôve decided to not give that relationship another thought. 

I *was* going to take her to Starbucks or something and buy her coffee and try to come at it like ‚Äúwe both love [partner] we don‚Äôt have to like each other but can we just have a respectful dislike?‚Äù Like it‚Äôs fine she doesn‚Äôt like me but it‚Äôs causing issues. But I realize that‚Äôs a lost cause. 

Then I find out something a lot worse. Well, two things actually. First I‚Äôll say I have armpit hair, I know many people find that gross, I do not care, my partner does not care, apparently his dad cares so much that he‚Äôs been trying to coach my partner on how to abuse and control me to fit what he (the father) thinks a woman should be. Okay, wow. Next I find out that his dad specifically thinks it is rude for my partner to translate for me and include me in the conversation. He specifically thinks it is righteous and correct to exclude me. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt get it please just accept that the level of resentment/loathing/entitlement to feel that way is deeply terrifying and I will never be alone with that man. 

My partner, of course, has not been taking his tips and kind of just appeased him but he loves me how I am and also he‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ whatever his dad is thank god. But he didn‚Äôt realize quite how terrifying that is until he saw my reaction. I ended up having to call my mother to talk it through because I was like ‚Äúeither I‚Äôm right or I need to be talked down‚Äù and it ended up a bit of both. Risk assessment, you know? 

It all comes to a head with my partner a couple nights ago. I try to talk to him about something small, he immediately gets defensive. And I‚Äôm so tired so I don‚Äôt argue. But time goes by, and I‚Äôm the kind of person to talk things out, so I bring it up how it was a bit hurtful, and he gets defensive again. This one was such a kick in the nuts because I told him how exhausted I was, and how I didn‚Äôt really want to bring it up because I felt so emotionally tired, and then he does the thing that he knows from his entirety of being in a relationship with me is one of the hardest responses for me to get. 

So honestly I go to the bedroom and lock him out. Because at that point I was so tired and so alone and in pain and scared. I‚Äôm in an apartment with someone I don‚Äôt recognize, with no one I know around, a family who is so much worse than I thought with at least two members who seem to hate me for existing‚Ä¶ Not to mention we just moved, got a cat, everything is just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a lot. It‚Äôs a lot to go through without a partner. 

He‚Äôs been doing things but only through his own lense, completely cut off from me and how I feel. Anyway‚Ä¶ it took a lot, and me having a total mental breakdown, but he‚Äôs back. In part. I can feel he‚Äôs back. But now I don‚Äôt know what to do. It feels like staying here will just take him from me again. 

Once he was out of his trance he saw it, saw everything. I didn‚Äôt have to explain it to him, and he was so apologetic and said shit like he doesn‚Äôt deserve me and I told him to cut that shit out, if he thinks I‚Äôm amazing then meet me there don‚Äôt set some sort of hierarchy. But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so terrified I‚Äôll lose him again. 

We hired movers‚Ä¶ we have the apartment‚Ä¶ but are we just in the event horizon of his family? I want him to have family, his younger sister and brother haven‚Äôt been anything but kind. His mother is unfortunately too trapped by the man who is her husband, and while I wish I could help her I can‚Äôt yet. 

I love this apartment, but for me it‚Äôs filled with fear. I‚Äôm really struggling with what to do. I know if he stays the person who is my partner we‚Äôll be fine. That man is empathetic and kind and loving and supportive. That‚Äôs the man who I can talk through anything with, the one I‚Äôd be happy to live my life with. But the man he became here‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not the man I love. It‚Äôs not him weak or vulnerable or hurt, it‚Äôs him gone from me. 

I don‚Äôt know if anyone can really say anything about this. I‚Äôm having so much trouble figuring out the right path and I‚Äôm in it‚Ä¶ All I know is I want to take the route that‚Äôs the best for me and my relationship. I just need help to figure out what that is. ",1,1756758917.0,whatdoIdo,4,0.67,False

Title: The Mystery of Kyber Crystals: A Speculation on Their Role in the Galaxy

  
The recent revelations about the true nature of the Death Star and its connection to the Empire's quest for power have left many fans with more questions than answers. One such question is the role that Kyber crystals play in this grand scheme, especially given their prominence in both Andor and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.

  
In ""Jedha, Kyber, Erso,"" we see Cassian's long walk to his destiny as he finally reaches out to the Rebellion for help. This episode also reveals that the Empire is using a superweapon powered by Kyber crystals - much like what happened in Rogue One when Darth Vader harnessed their power to create the Death Star.

  
The connection between these two stories suggests that there may be more at stake than just political turmoil or personal vendettas. Could it be possible that the Empire's obsession with Kyber crystals is part of a larger plan? A plan so grand, it could change the course of history itself?

  
We know from canon sources like Star Wars Rebels and The Clone Wars that Jedi Knights use lightsabers powered by these same crystals. This implies an inherent connection between the Force and Kyber energy - a bond forged through centuries of tradition and spiritual growth. If this is true, then it stands to reason that whoever controls the supply of these precious stones would hold immense power over not only galactic politics but also the very fabric of reality itself.

  
In light of this information, we must consider how Cassian's mission in Andor ties into the larger Star Wars narrative. His journey mirrors that of many Jedi before him - a quest to find his place within the Force and use it for good. By connecting with the Rebellion, he may be setting the stage for future heroes like Luke Skywalker or Rey.

  
The implications of this speculation are vast. If the Empire is indeed harnessing Kyber crystal energy on a massive scale, then we can expect to see more powerful weapons and technologies in the coming years. This could lead to even greater conflicts between the forces of light and darkness, pushing our favorite characters into situations they never imagined possible.

  
In conclusion, while we may not have all the answers yet, it's clear that Kyber crystals play a crucial role in shaping the Star Wars universe. Their connection to both Jedi tradition and Imperial ambition makes them an essential element of any fan theory worth its salt. As we continue to explore this fascinating galaxy far, far away, let us remember that sometimes the smallest details can hold the key to unlocking the greatest mysteries.

I've never used multiplayer in IN so far, not even to illuminate. I'm generally a solo gamer and it wasn't something I was really interested in, plus social anxiety is a b*tch. Add to that, the Sea of Stars isn't a place I really love to hang out. However, the posts I've been seeing about in-game meetups look really fun. Plus, I'm really intrigued by a couple multiplayer features they're adding in 1.9 for housing.

*Gift Wrapping Table: Prepare gifts and greeting cards for friends

*Home Likes: When visiting other islands, try stepping on the like zone and plunge to give a big thumbs up.

I love the idea of getting to go visit other players' houses to see what they've designed, and giving gifts and cards seems like it could be fun, like making starwish bottles for a friend. Do you think you'll use these features?

I think I might finally need to give multiplayer a try, but I'm curious what other people think. Do you like or dislike multiplayer?  Do you usually have good experiences or too many bad ones? 

Bonus question: For PS5 or controller-based players, how do you deal with chat in multiplayer? Is it awkward?",5,1756758799.0,InfinityNikki,8,0.78,False

I was just catching up on some celebrity news and stumbled upon an interesting read about Willa Holland, which you can check out right here: [Discover Willa Holland's fascinating journey](https://ubergossip.com/willa-holland-height-weight-age-body-statistics-american-celebrities/). I wanted to share my thoughts, almost like we're chatting over coffee! ‚òï

### A Quick Look at Willa Holland

The article gives a really nice overview of Willa Holland's career, from her early days to becoming a recognizable face in Hollywood. It doesn't drop any major plot twists or deep secrets, which I appreciate. Instead, it paints a picture of someone who's been steadily working in the entertainment industry for quite some time, navigating different roles and growing up in the public eye. It‚Äôs more of a career retrospective mixed with some interesting personal stats.

### What Stood Out to Me ü§î

What I really liked about learning more about Willa is just how consistent she's been. It's easy to forget how long some actors have been around, especially when they start young. Her dedication to her craft really shines through. I also found it neat to see the details about her physical presence ‚Äì things like her height and how that might influence her roles. It‚Äôs not something you usually think about, but it definitely plays a part in how she projects herself on screen. She seems to carry a quiet confidence, which I find really appealing. To get more insights into her professional and personal growth, you might want to [Dive deeper into Willa Holland's career and stats](https://ubergossip.com/willa-holland-height-weight-age-body-statistics-american-celebrities/).

### A Little Thought

If there was one thing I wished for, it would be maybe a few more personal anecdotes or quotes from her about her experiences. Sometimes these types of articles focus more on the external journey, and while that's great, a little peek into her mindset or emotions during different phases of her career would have been a lovely addition. But honestly, that's just a personal preference! The article still offers a solid, clear look at her professional life.

Overall, it was a genuinely engaging read that made me appreciate her journey even more. It's always cool to learn a bit more about the people behind the characters we love. If you're a fan, or just curious, I definitely recommend giving it a read! What do you all think about Willa Holland? Share your thoughts below! üëá

1n5zt6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTicker/comments/1n5zt6h/nestl√©_ousts_ceo_over_office_affair_and_taps/,Nestl√© Ousts CEO Over Office Affair and Taps Nespresso Boss,"Bloomberg) -- Nestl√© SA dismissed Chief Executive Officer Laurent Freixe after only a year due to an undisclosed workplace affair, extending the management turmoil at the world‚Äôs biggest food company that‚Äôs known for its conservative corporate culture. 

An investigation showed that Freixe had an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate that violated Nestl√©‚Äôs code of conduct, according to a release late Monday from the Swiss owner of Purina pet supplies and KitKat chocolate bars. It named Philipp Navratil, who heads the Nespresso coffee brand, as his replacement.

‚ÄúThis was a necessary decision,‚Äù Chairman Paul Bulcke said in the statement. ‚ÄúNestl√©‚Äôs values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service.‚Äù

The abrupt change extends a period of turbulence in Nestl√©‚Äôs leadership. Freixe took over after the surprise ouster last year of Mark Schneider, who was let go due to sluggish performance during his nearly eight-year tenure. At the time, Freixe was seen as a safe pair of hands who would restore Nestl√©‚Äôs traditional strengths after Schneider ‚Äî a rare outsider in the top job ‚Äî had taken the company in new directions.

‚ÄúThis comes at a sensitive juncture, as Nestle is already under the spotlight amid a negative news flow,‚Äù said Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy. ‚ÄúNestl√© should soon find calmer waters, as investors‚Äô nerves have been tested for several months.‚Äù

Nestl√© said its probe was overseen by Bulcke and the lead independent director, Pablo Isla, with the support of independent outside counsel. The company has nominated Isla to succeed Bulcke as chairman next year.

The matter involving Freixe was first brought to company officials‚Äô attention through an internal system called ‚Äúspeak up,‚Äù according to a person familiar with the situation. After the allegations couldn‚Äôt be substantiated via an initial probe, further concerns were raised via the internal system and the investigation with external counsel was launched, according to the person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified discussing an internal matter.

Freixe will not receive an exit package, a spokesperson said.

Other Ousters

The ousted chief is the latest of several consumer and retail company bosses to lose their jobs over workplace relationships in recent years.

McDonald‚Äôs Corp. dismissed then-CEO Steve Easterbrook in 2019 after he had a consensual relationship with an employee, and in 2025 Kohl‚Äôs Corp. removed CEO Ashley Buchanan, who had directed millions of dollars of business to a romantic partner. 

Freixe aimed to reignite growth and win over shoppers by boosting advertising spending and betting on fewer but bigger product initiatives. He also kicked off a strategic review of struggling vitamin brands and spun off Nestl√©‚Äôs waters business into a standalone unit. However, he failed to regain investors‚Äô trust, with Nestl√© shares declining 17% under his tenure, compared with a roughly 5% decline for rival Unilever Plc.

Nestl√©‚Äôs sales volumes contracted 0.4% in the second quarter.

New Chief

Navratil, a company veteran of more than 20 years, joined the executive board at the start of this year. Before running Nespresso, he was senior vice president and head of the Coffee Strategic Business Unit, where he was responsible for global strategy for the Nescaf√© brand and a licensing partnership with Starbucks.

‚ÄúI fully embrace the company‚Äôs strategic direction, as well as the action plan in place to drive Nestl√©‚Äôs performance,‚Äù he said, according to Monday‚Äôs statement.

Navratil has the potential to accelerate long-term growth and look at portfolio restructurings such as an exit from lower-growth cereals and water, Bloomberg Intelligence‚Äôs Duncan Fox said in a note. As Navratil has yet to turn 50, he could see a 10-year-plus tenure, Fox added.

Another challenge for Nestl√© is the global trade friction prompted by US President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Freixe has often pointed to the fact that some 90% of Nestle‚Äôs US-sold products are made domestically. One prominent exception is Nespresso capsules, which are exclusively produced in Switzerland and now face a 39% tariff.

We're almost exclusively light-medium espresso drinkers, and we rarely make milk drinks. I like to think I'd make them more often with better steaming, but I'll still probably drink espresso 95% of the time. 

I'm looking for much better consistency with lighter coffees and flow control is something I'd definitely like to play with. 

From everything I've read, the Classika seems like it's a great choice, but I hate that it can't be plumbed. The rotary pump has me thinking the Aria might make more sense, although I'm a little concerned about an HX for consistency. Build quality and part availability are also somewhat questionable with the Aria.

I'm also considering the Go as a stop gap, until I can budget for something that can be plumbed that isn't an HX. I'm not opposed to buying something used or refurbished if it makes sense.

Usually preempted by taking a significant amount of time to focus on yourself and become who you truly are. When you fully know yourself you attract people who are better aligned to your life goals and position.

I was single for a period of 5 years after my last breakup. No dating and complete celibacy for the last 2 of those 5 years. I had done tremendous work on my hobbies, career, and life goals. I made a pivotal career change, bought a condo completely on my own, and fostered a village of wonderful friends from scratch. I was not looking for love, because I found it in myself. I had nurtured the most confident and self-aware version of myself. At 35, I was standing in my power and I was out in the world doing solo activities or group activities at least once a week.

This past May, I engineered a group for participating in one of my favorite water sports. I led multiple group outings and we all had such a great time. One of the girls who goes out with me on these meetups mentioned a mutual friend was interested and asking if he could join us. I said sure, of course. The more the merrier. It was already a co-ed group.

When he came out to our next meetup, I found him very physically attractive. I didn't think much more of it because I just don't pay much attention to men in a romantic sense these days out of self-protection. Long story short, after several more meetups that he joined over the course of 1-2 months--he contacted me directly to hang out at the beach. It was a one-on-one hangout, and he was very inquisitive about me. He asked me my relationship status and some other compatibility questions. I told him I've been single for years and wasn't looking, but if the right person were to come into my life, I'd go for it. He mentioned he was single as of 4 months ago, and that it was an on/off thing for a few years. At the end of our hangout on the beach, he turned to me directly and said he liked me. Even before his statement, I was warming up to him with the conversations we had all afternoon.

He pursued me very strongly over the next week or so, inviting me to go on long bike rides with him, stop for food, and chat on the beach. I was so excited to meet someone like this who I was finding myself really into. One night as we were eating and talking and staring into each other's souls, I mentioned that if he continues to see me like this, I'd like him to know that I do not want to share. His eyes lit up and he was blushing and he agreed that he would not like to share either. The following night, we were laying together on the beach at sunset and he asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes with enthusiasm. To this point, we had not yet been intimate.

He bought me roses. We had a few more hangouts before we went to bed together, and then when we did get intimate, everything was so natural and connected. I would argue that it was the best I'd ever had. We continued to see each other about 3-4 times a week (at his request). He introduced me to some of his best friends, told some of his family and associates about me, and mentioned to me that he'd like me to meet his brother soon. He would text me every day as well.

The sex kept getting better with each session, and we continued to have fun with outside activities. We would cook for each other, he'd make me coffee every morning I was there. He'd get up and watch the sunrise with me before I left for work on the weekdays I stayed over. In total, we were deeply involved multiple days a week for 4-5 weeks. We couldn't keep our hands off each other. Shared deep eye contact, talked about a lot of things. Nothing about marriage or that far ahead yet, which seemed fine for the timing. Nothing too deep about past relationships, again seemed too early. Just getting to know our day-to-day selves. By this point, he had given me a guest parking decal for his garage.

Last weekend, on Saturday morning I noticed he was suddenly very distant. I tried to have a conversation about it with him and he was somewhat vague and said he was feeling some anxiety. I asked him if he felt that I was spending too much time over and offered to take off for the day and give him some space. He said no, he wasn't thinking of that, but after another hour or so, he was still in such a different mood than usual. I told him, its not a problem and I'll get out of his space so he can relax and I left that Saturday around 3pm. He said he was going to go visit with his parents and talk with them.

I spent the rest of the weekend away and neither of us contacted each other until Monday when he texted me ""hope you had a relaxing rest of your weekend and I wish you a successful day"", to which I responded ""I'm good, and I hope you were able to relax as well and spend time with your family"". He said ""thank you! :)""

Tuesday, I figured I'd reach out to him first to keep it balanced. ""Hello, thinking of you. Hope your week is going well"". He answered promptly but cold. I let it go and said nothing more.

Wednesday, I decided to call him. He answered my call, but he said he was playing tennis with some friends and they were done but going to go get food. He said he'd call me back. He did not call me back that night; however, he texted me at 9am to apologize for not calling and that he stayed out late with the friends. I answered that I was glad he reached out and that I would like to know when I could stop by to get my gear from his house because I had plans to do the water sport we met doing and I had left the stuff there. He said he'd be home by 5. I said I'd let him know when I was out front for him to bring it out to me. He said ""Yes, but park downstairs because we deserve to have a conversation""

I agreed and went over, he brought me into his apartment and said ""I know you want to know what is going on with me""

I let him explain himself and it turned into a lengthy, vulnerable, emotional conversation about how he was feeling. He revealed that he was hit with a wave of unresolved emotions from his past relationship. He said that he no longer loved her, and that he ended it, but she keeps trying to pop up in his life. According to him, she showed up at his apartment unannounced some weeks ago (prior to us dating), and other things. He said he's resenting that he spent the last 2 years of their relationship together because they both wasted each others time, and he knew by then he didn't want to marry her and she wanted that. He said he had a session with his psychotherapist and they believe he's not ready to date as its still too fresh. He told me that he wanted to pause what we had going on so that he can continue therapy and work through it.

I said that I understood, but I was disappointed because I liked him so much and was looking forward to experiences to come. He said there's nothing that I did wrong, and that I am special and a ""worthy"" woman. He called me ""baby"" a few times as he was talking. He walked me to my car and carried my stuff for me. He embraced me tightly and kissed my neck. He said ""we'll talk soon"" and then he reclaimed the parking decal and let me go. 

I am very proud of myself for accepting his explanation and not begging or trying to negotiate something less for myself; however, I am so very sad that this is the way its gone. I let myself be free and authentic with him and trust his intentions as his actions were those of someone who was genuinely interested, but I have no choice but to let him go in this situation. I'm not angry, but I'm totally shaken and feel like I'm withdrawing from hard drugs. I have been floating for the past month experiencing such an intense connection, and now its like I never even knew him. 

I know it sounds like too much too soon, but his actions did line up with his words the whole time we were seeing each other. I am really frustrated because I wasn't even looking for anything, and now it dominates my thoughts. I don't really need any advise because I know I just need to re-focus on myself and go no contact, which I have the self-control to do. Would love some positive thoughts though because I was really falling in love with him and now I'm just stuck in a state of limerence and doubting my own reality that ever truly cared about me.",1,1756758284.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm extremely scared of something like that happening again and am trying to be as distant as possible. I‚Äôve been very careful to not give this guy any reason to believe I‚Äôm interested in him but unfortunately I think he‚Äôs still interested in me. He doesn‚Äôt seem creepy at all but he has asked me to get coffee with him twice and I made up excuses bc I‚Äôm bad on the spot in person. Today he called me (I didn‚Äôt answer) and then texted that he was calling to ask if I want to get coffee and do the homework together tomorrow. 

He might just genuinely want to be friends but I don‚Äôt want to lead him on in ANY way after what happened with the stalker last year. I‚Äôve decided I need to send a text telling him I‚Äôm in a relationship and am not interested in him. How do I word it politely so things aren‚Äôt awkward for the next 14 weeks we have to be in class together. ",23,1756758061.0,college,4,0.85,False

My throat is always dry, so I sip water several times a day, but I don‚Äôt want it to drink a lot of it. Hope that makes sense. 

FWIW, I‚Äôm always dehydrated, but I have to force myself to get in even 40 oz per day including my 6 oz of coffee. Based on ounces per weight formulas, I should be drinking something like 80-100 ounces a day. Two to three times a year, I faint and wind up getting an IV for fluids.

A Turner
Mia Turner stood frozen at the entrance to the living room, her fingers clutching the strap of her work bag. Her sister Lily had interrupted her while she was getting ready, insisting their mother had something important to discuss. 

‚ÄúMia, sit down,‚Äù her mother, Mary Turner, ordered, lounging on the worn-out sofa like a queen holding court. Her bright red lipstick clashed with the faded blush on her face, her manicured nails tapping against her wine glass.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt this wait? I have work,‚Äù Mia replied, her voice tight. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford to be late again.‚Äù

Her mother raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWork? You mean playing servant to those rich snobs at Casa Lounge? Please.‚Äù

Mia bit her tongue. She knew better than to rise to the bait. She needed this job. Casa Lounge wasn‚Äôt just a paycheck; it was her lifeline, the first step in her plan to save enough money to leave Willowcrest and the stigma of being a Turner behind.

Ethan, her older brother, sat slouched in the corner, scrolling through his phone. His indifference to the chaos of their family was almost admirable. At least he stayed out of the endless bickering.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this about, Mom?‚Äù Mia asked, her patience slipping.

Mary‚Äôs lips curled into a smile. ‚ÄúWe have good news.‚Äù

Mia blinked, skeptical. ‚ÄúGood news?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Lily, the eldest, jumped in, practically glowing with excitement. ‚ÄúI got a golden invite to the Willowcrest Unicorn Party!‚Äù

Mia blinked again, slower this time, trying to process how this was supposed to be good news. The Unicorn Party‚Äîthe most exclusive, over-the-top event for the rich and powerful‚Äîwas as far removed from her world as the moon.

‚ÄúAnd this is good news‚Ä¶ how?‚Äù Mia asked, genuinely baffled.

‚ÄúAttending will be nice though,‚Äù Ethan muttered without looking up from his phone.

‚ÄúNice?!‚Äù Lily‚Äôs voice rose an octave. ‚ÄúDo you have any idea what this means? The richest bachelors in the world will be there! This is it!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd how did your name end up on the list?‚Äù Mia asked, her tone sharper than she intended.

‚ÄúConnections,‚Äù Mary said smugly, swirling her wine.

Mia didn‚Äôt want to dig deeper into what kind of ‚Äúconnections‚Äù her mother was referring to. She knew the answer wouldn‚Äôt be pleasant.

‚ÄúOkay, so Lily‚Äôs going to some fancy party. What does that have to do with me?‚Äù Mia asked, checking the time on her phone. She really couldn‚Äôt afford to be late.

Mary leaned forward, her voice dropping into a conspiratorial tone. ‚ÄúThis is our chance, Mia. Lily just needs to catch the eye of the right man. A billionaire. Someone who can change all our lives.‚Äù

Mia resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Of course, it was another one of her mother‚Äôs schemes. Everything in Mary Turner‚Äôs life revolved around chasing rich men, and her daughters were no exception.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy for Lily,‚Äù Mia said flatly, rising to leave. ‚ÄúCongratulations and good luck with the party. I have to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúSit down, Mia,‚Äù Mary snapped, her tone sharpening.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be late‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSit!‚Äù

Reluctantly, Mia dropped back onto the couch, glancing at the clock on the wall. She was already cutting it too close.

‚ÄúListen, you all know how much we suffer and lose after that old bastard put me in Jail. This is a one time opportunity that will change our lives forever‚Äù

‚Äú How does that even concern me? Or did the whole family get invited?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wish‚Ä¶‚Äù Lily said with snort. ‚Äú No one is inviting you to that kind of party with that face‚Äù

Ethan chuckles, pulling eyes to him

‚ÄúLily you have to stop pretending, like Mia isn't the prettiest in this family‚Äù Ethan said, eyes still fixed on his phone.

‚ÄúEww, don't say it like that you're my brother‚Äù Mia smiles, always trying to get under his brother's skin

‚ÄúDid I mention she is the most stupid?‚Äù

‚ÄúI try‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough both of you‚Äù Mary scolds

‚ÄúI seriously need to get to work mom, whatever this is obviously doesn't concern me‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways so proud talking about it, like it's a real job?‚Äù Anna, the middle sister, said with a snide laugh.

‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm doing something!‚Äù Mia snapped.

Before the argument could escalate further, Mary‚Äôs phone buzzed. She checked the screen, a sly smile spreading across her face. ‚ÄúSame time, same place, Barry? I‚Äôll be there,‚Äù she said into the phone, her voice dripping with seduction.

Mia felt a wave of disgust wash over her. She didn‚Äôt need to guess what the call was about. It was her mother‚Äôs usual business‚Äîentertaining some wealthy man in exchange for cash, gifts, or favors.

As Mary hung up, she turned her attention back to Mia. ‚ÄúThe point is, we all need to contribute to get your sister everything she needs for that party. You included.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is ridiculous mom! Count me out,‚Äù Mia said, her voice steely.

Mary‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be selfish, Mia. This is for the family.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't have have money‚Äù

‚ÄúYes you do‚Äù Anna rushed to say. ‚ÄúYou've been saving a lot of money for college.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike you said college‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is more than college and I've told you a thousand times you're a Turner you have no business with College‚Äù Mary says, checking her phone.

‚Äú And I have said it a million times, I'm not like you! I don't want to be like you, I don't want to sit around and wait for some rich guy to come change my life‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you think you're better than us now?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my god! I'm leaving. Lily I'm sure you can sort yourself out, and if you do get your billionaire boyfriend or husband remember not to give me a dime from his money‚Äù

Mia grabs her bag and heads for the door.

College in another country is her way out, no one is jeopardizing that for her.

There's nothing she wants than to leave this town, remove the curse name she bears from her existence.

‚ÄúOh you're a Turner, never mind‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're a Turner you have no say‚Äù

‚ÄúGirl you're a Turner‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're Turner Shut up and open your legs‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a Turner trying to form modesty‚Äù

Chosen For The Game
Alexander Blackwell was known for many things in Willowcrest: his wealth, his looks, his reputation as the bad boy every story tried to capture, but never quite could. Patience, however, wasn‚Äôt on the list. Yet, for Zoe Harrington‚Äîhis girlfriend‚Äîhe tried. Tried being the word.

Casa Lounge was his usual spot in the evenings, the perfect escape before his underground matches. Tonight, though, he wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here. He had a fight in less than two hours, but it was Zoe‚Äôs birthday. And Zoe got what Zoe wanted‚Äîmost of the time.

He sat back in his booth, swirling his glass of whiskey lazily as he watched Zoe talking to a new face in Willowcrest, her glittery dress hugging her like a second skin. She was shamelessly rubbing her body on him‚ÄîDickson, or whatever his name was. A new face in Willowcrest, clearly is unaware of who Alexander was.

The sight didn‚Äôt bother him; nothing Zoe did ever truly got under his skin. Their relationship thrived on chaos. He smirked, watching her antics, amused more than anything else. She was testing him, as always.

When Zoe finally realized her games weren‚Äôt ruffling his feathers, she walks over to him, her pout on full display.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even get jealous anymore,‚Äù she whined, plopping down beside him.

Alexander looked up from his glass, his voice calm and cool. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do, break some poor guy‚Äôs nose?‚Äù

Her pout deepened. ‚ÄúWhen did you even start caring about people?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly my point!‚Äù She crossed her arms, glaring. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so‚Ä¶ boring now.‚Äù

Alexander hummed in response, his attention flicking toward the crowd again. But then his gaze caught on someone. A Turner.

There she was laughing with her coworker at the bar. Her smile lit up her otherwise simple features, her uniform crisp and modest.The sight of her irritates him.

He did consider asking his friend that owns the place to fire her when they first employed her.

‚ÄúMan, why would you employ a Turner?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe's pretty‚Äù

‚ÄúStill a Turner‚Äù

‚ÄúWon't be one when her pretty lips are wrapped around my dick‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on I want to have a taste of all of them‚Äù

He blinks back to reality, jaw tensed. He knew all about the Turners. Everyone in Willowcrest did. A family that had no business staying in this town.

‚ÄúI feel like our spark is dying.‚Äù

Alexander sighed, half-listening as he took another sip of his drink. ‚ÄúYou say that every day, babe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean it this time. I think we need‚Ä¶ more games.‚Äù

He raised a brow, setting his glass down. ‚ÄúGames? Zoe, we did threesomes the entire month of October. What‚Äôs left?‚Äù

She leaned forward, pressing her lips against his, her tone dropping to a playful whisper. ‚ÄúI want us to go extreme this time.‚Äù

He tilted his head, watching her with mild amusement. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insane.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe both are.‚Äù She smiled sweetly, her eyes glinting with mischief.

He sighed, leaning back. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your big idea this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe break up for a month,‚Äù she began, her smile widening. ‚ÄúWe each date someone new. You sleep with them, I sleep with mine.‚Äù

Alexander stared at her, incredulous. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve officially lost it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, come on! It‚Äôll be fun,‚Äù Zoe pressed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we don‚Äôt always find our way back to each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs the benefit of this game? Or is this just your twisted idea of fun?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo spice up our relationship!‚Äù she said as though it were obvious. ‚ÄúAnd‚Äî‚Äù she added with a wink‚Äî‚Äúyou‚Äôll be saying no to my birthday present if you don‚Äôt agree.‚Äù

‚ÄúThought you wanted a shopping spree in Paris?‚Äù he drawled.

She waved it off. ‚ÄúChanged my mind.‚Äù

Alexander sighed, rubbing his temple. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

Zoe practically squealed, climbing into his lap to kiss him. ‚ÄúThank you, baby!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm already regretting this,‚Äù he muttered against her lips.

‚ÄúOkay, okay, let‚Äôs pick!‚Äù Zoe said, bouncing excitedly. Her eyes darted around the lounge. ‚ÄúNot her. Not her. Oh‚Äîher!‚Äù

Alexander followed her gaze, his glass pausing mid-air. His eyes landed on Mia Turner, and he nearly choked on his drink.

‚ÄúA Turner?‚Äù he asked in disbelief.

Zoe nodded enthusiastically. ‚ÄúYup. I heard she‚Äôs different from her sisters. Lucas even tried to get with her, and she turned him down. Can you imagine? She might actually give you a challenge.‚Äù

Alexander shook his head firmly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not getting anywhere near a Turner, Zoe.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs pretty,‚Äù Zoe argued.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs still a Turner.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlex, please?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo Zoe I‚Äôm not putting my dick into a Turner ‚Äú

Zoe pouted, turning her attention to her nails. ‚ÄúFine. If you‚Äôre not going to play, fine. But I guess my birthday‚Äôs ruined.‚Äù

Alexander groaned. As twisted as their relationship was, he loved Zoe. They‚Äôd grown up together, transitioning from childhood friends to lovers. And while she drove him insane, he couldn‚Äôt imagine life without her.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he finally relented.

Zoe lit up, throwing her arms around his neck. ‚ÄúYes! Thank you, baby! Okay, now your turn. Pick someone for me.‚Äù

Alexander leaned back, scanning the room. His eyes landed on Jeremy‚Äîa local businessman and soon-to-be groom. A wicked smirk curved his lips. ‚ÄúHim.‚Äù

Zoe frowned. ‚ÄúJeremy? Isn‚Äôt he getting married next month?‚Äù

‚ÄúEven better,‚Äù Alexander replied smoothly. ‚ÄúLike you said, the game is sweeter if it‚Äôs harder to achieve.‚Äù

Zoe grinned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre twisted, Alex.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Blackwell babes ?‚Äù

The Proposal
Mia was exhausted. Her legs ached from standing for hours, her head throbbed from the endless stream of demanding customers, and her soul felt drained from another day of pretending to be unbothered. 

Casa Lounge had been bustling tonight, and all she wanted now was to catch the next bus home, crawl into bed, and pray that her mother and siblings were out of the house. She couldn‚Äôt deal with them today‚Äînot with their drama, their judgment, and their constant reminder of the name she desperately wanted to escape.  

She stood at the bus stop, clutching her bag tightly, watching as headlights passed by, one after the other. The night air was cool, the breeze teasing strands of her hair.

Her thoughts were interrupted by the purr of an engine. Mia looked up, startled, as a sleek black sports car slowed to a stop in front of her. Its headlights bathed her in blinding light. She squinted, taking a step back, ready to bolt if necessary. Nothing good ever came out of expensive cars stopping for people like her.  

The door opened, and out stepped Alexander Blackwell.  

Mia‚Äôs breath caught in her throat.  

He wasn‚Äôt just handsome; he was devastatingly handsome. Towering with broad shoulders, a face carved like a Greek god, and an aura of confidence that demanded attention, Alexander Blackwell was every bit the enigma he is said to be. His presence was overwhelming, the kind of presence that knocked the air out of your lungs before you even realized it.  

He leaned casually against his car, his gaze fixed on her like he had all the time in the world.  

""Hey,"" he said, his voice smooth and laced with an edge of arrogance.  

Mia blinked, unsure if her brain was playing tricks on her. She glanced behind her, twice, certain there must be someone else he was addressing. Surely, ‚Äòa Blackwell‚Äô couldn‚Äôt be talking to her.  

""I‚Äôm talking to you, Turner,"" he said, smirking.  

Her mind went blank. All she could do was stammer. ""W-what? Me?""  

""Yup.""  

Mia clutched her bag tighter. She looked at him like he‚Äôd just announced the sky was green. ""Why‚Ä¶ why are you talking to me?""  

His smirk deepened, and then, without warning, he said, ""Go on a date with me.""  

Mia froze. The words hit her like a thunderclap. Did she hear him right? She blinked rapidly, waiting for the punchline, but his face remained serious, even amused.  

""What?"" she choked out. ""Y-you have a girlfriend.""  

Alexander shrugged, pushing his hands into his pockets. ""Not anymore. We broke up. Check the news, Turner.""  

The casual way he said it made her feel like she‚Äôd stepped into some alternate reality. Her mind struggled to catch up.  

""I don‚Äôt understand,"" she said, her voice shaky.  

""How much?""  

Mia blinked again. ""What?""  

""I said, how much to go on dates with me?""  

It took her a second to process his words. Her jaw dropped as realization hit her. ""You‚Ä¶ you want to pay me to go on dates with you?""  

""Maybe,"" he said, his tone nonchalant, as if he were discussing the weather.  

""Why?"" she demanded, her voice rising in confusion. ‚Äú You don‚Äôt even know my name!""  

""I know enough, Turner."" 

God! she hates when she's being address like this

Mia felt anger under her exhaustion. Her hands balled into fists at her sides. ""No,"" she said firmly.  

Alexander raised a brow. ""What?""  

""I said no.""  

He tilted his head, genuinely surprised. ""Why?""  

Mia stared at him, incredulous. ""What do you mean, why? You don‚Äôt even know me. You‚Äôve never talked to me before. And now you suddenly want to‚Äîwhat?‚Äîbuy me for dates? When I just saw you yesterday with your girlfriend""  

""Don‚Äôt tell me you were watching me, Turner,"" he said, his smirk returning.  

""You wish,"" she snapped.  

""Trust me, that can‚Äôt be part of my wishes,"" he said coolly. His eyes glinted with amusement. ""Name your price, Turner.""  

""I said no!"" she spat, her voice firm. ""You can‚Äôt just buy people to go on dates with you. I‚Äôm not interested.""  

Alexander‚Äôs smirk faltered for a split second. He stepped closer, his presence overwhelming, as he stared down at her. ""You‚Äôre a Turner,"" he said, his tone dropping. ""Stop acting like you have any pride""  

Her chest tightened, anger bubbling inside her. ""Please, leave me alone,"" she said through gritted teeth.  

He stepped back, his smirk returning like a mask. ""Three dates, Five thousand, for each.""  

Mia‚Äôs eyes widened. ""What?""  

""You heard me. Sleep over it, Turner.""  

And just like that, he turned, got into his car, and drove off, leaving her standing there, speechless, her thoughts swirling into chaos.  

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù

The Tempting Offer
Mia barely got any sleep that night. She tossed and turned, replaying the surreal encounter with Alexander Blackwell over and over in her mind. The way he‚Äôd looked at her, the arrogance in his tone, the absurdity of his offer‚Äî5,000 per date? It felt like a cruel joke, one meant to humiliate her.  

But then the thought of the money would creep back in, unbidden. 5 thousand dollars. For three dates, that will be 15 thousand dollars. It was more money than she could hope to save in years at Casa Lounge. 

15 thousand could pay for a lot, rent, food... It could be her fastest way out of Willowcrest. 

Mia sat up in bed and groaned, running her hands through her hair. No. She shouldn't even entertain the thoughts. 

Whatever game Alexander Blackwell was playing, she wanted no part of it. That money might save her now, but taking money from a Blackwell will definitely come with strings she wasn‚Äôt willing to pull. 

By morning, she was still exhausted but determined to stick to her decision. She trudged out of her tiny room and into the kitchen, hoping for some coffee to start her day. As she entered, she heard her sisters talking, their voices low. 

‚ÄúThere's no way it‚Äôs real,‚Äù Lily was saying, her tone dripping with skepticism.  

‚ÄúIt could be,‚Äù Anna shot back, flipping her hair over her shoulder. ‚ÄúPeople are saying it all over town.‚Äù  

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Mia asked groggily, heading to the cupboard to grab a glass. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Mom?‚Äù  

‚ÄúOut. Probably won‚Äôt be back until God knows when,‚Äù Anna replied, not even sparing her a glance.  

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre delusional if you think they‚Äôve broken up,‚Äù Lily said, laughing. ‚ÄúZoe would rather chew glass than break up with Blackwell.‚Äù  

Mia froze, her hand clutching the glass tightly.  

‚ÄúOr maybe he broke up with her,‚Äù Anna said with a sly smile.  

Lily snorted. ‚ÄúOh my God, Anna, don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre still holding onto the hope that you‚Äôll get him one day. It‚Äôs embarrassing at this point.‚Äù  

Mia turned slowly, her stomach sinking as she listened to the exchange.  

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not delusional!‚Äù Anna snapped. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre one to talk. At least I tried. Unlike you, who‚Äôs too busy chasing any rich guy who gives you a second glance.‚Äù  

‚Äú‚ÄòTried‚Äô is an understatement,‚Äù Lily said, cackling. ‚ÄúWalking around naked in the Blackwell mansion three days after you were employed? Please. That was pathetic.‚Äù  

Anna‚Äôs face flushed, and she opened her mouth to retort, but Lily kept going.  

‚ÄúFace it, Anna. We‚Äôre Turners. The Blackwells doesn‚Äôt even look at us like we‚Äôre human. They hate our family‚Äôs existence.‚Äù  

‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù Anna huffed, crossing her arms.  

Mia forced herself to move, walking to the sink to pour herself some water. Her hands were shaking, and she prayed neither of them would notice. 

HmmOnce inside, she grabbed her phone from the nightstand and immediately opened the Willowcrest Morning News. There, staring back at her in bold letters, was the headline:  

**Alexander Blackwell and Zoe Harrington Call It Quits.**  

Mia‚Äôs heart raced as she read the article. Zoe had confirmed the breakup in an interview the night before, saying they‚Äôd decided to take a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù to focus on themselves. The tone of the article was suspicious, though, hinting at drama behind the scenes.  

Mia put the phone down and leaned against the wall, her mind spinning. Was this why he‚Äôd approached her? Because he was single now and needed someone to‚Ä¶ what? Fill the void? Become part of his ridiculous games?  

She shook her head.

She couldn‚Äôt let herself get sucked into whatever madness was going on.  

Just then, her phone buzzed in her hand. The notification made her stomach drop. She hesitated for a moment before looking at the screen.  

The message was from an unknown number.  

Good morning, Turner. Don‚Äôt bother asking how I got your number. My offer still stands: three dates, 5,000 for each one. You have three days to decide.  

Mia stared at the message, her heart pounding in her chest. Her fingers trembled as she read it again. She could practically hear his voice in the text, that cool, arrogant tone that told her he was used to getting exactly what he wanted.  

For a moment, she considered deleting the message, pretending it never existed. But instead, she sank onto the edge of her bed, clutching her phone tightly.  

Fifteen thousand dollars.  

Her mind raced with possibilities. She could finally afford to leave Willowcrest, start fresh. 

But then the image of Alexander Blackwell‚Äôs smirk flashed in her mind, and anger bubbled to the surface.  

Three days

The Blackwells
The Blackwell mansion loomed like a dark, silent predator as Alex walks up the marble steps and pushed through the heavy doors. 

The house was grand‚Äîbut it felt nothing like a home. 

Dinner here wasn‚Äôt about family bonding; it was a calculated performance, one Alex hated but endured because his mother and brother were involved. The only two people who ground him to this dysfunctional circus. Well‚Ä¶ them, and Zoe.  

He walked into the dining room, his steps echoing against the polished floors. His family was already seated, the tension visible before a single word was spoken.  

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this nonsense I hear about you and Zoe?‚Äù his father, Charles Blackwell, demanded without so much as looking up. His tone was sharp and cold, like a blade slicing through the air.  

Alex didn‚Äôt falter, didn‚Äôt blink. He slid into his seat with a practiced ease, his face carefully neutral. ‚ÄúGood evening, Father,‚Äù he replied smoothly, ignoring the obvious jab.  

‚ÄúDid you ice that cut, darling?‚Äù His mother, Esther, leaned forward, her soft features tight with concern. Her gaze flicked to the small wound on his temple from his most recent underground fight.  

Alex waved her off. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, Mother.‚Äù  

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you let a rookie do that to you,‚Äù Charles sneered, his voice filled with disdain.  

‚ÄúI won, Father,‚Äù Alex said, his voice edged with amusement. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what matters, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù  

Charles‚Äôs lips curled into a snarl. ‚ÄúYou think this is a joke? I told you to postpone your fights for the week. Investors are flying in tomorrow, and you‚Äôre moving around, looking like some street thug. Do you realize the stakes? We could lose millions!‚Äù  

Alex leaned back in his chair, completely unfazed. ‚ÄúAnd yet I made sweet money last night from fighting. Your priorities are not mine, Father.‚Äù  

Charles‚Äôs gaze darkened. Without warning, he grabbed Julian‚Äôs wrist and slammed it onto the table.  

Alex stiffened.  

Julian, his older brother, winced, his lips trembling as he fought to suppress any sound of pain. Alex‚Äôs stomach twisted as he watched the familiar scene unfold.  

Charles Blackwell wasn‚Äôt a father. He was a tyrant, a monster! A manipulator who thrived on power and control, and when Alex pushed his limits, it was always Julian or his mother who bore the brunt of his wrath.  

‚ÄúDo you think this is a game, Alexander?‚Äù Charles hissed, pressing harder on Julian‚Äôs hand.  

Julian‚Äôs eyes were shut tight, his breath uneven, but he didn‚Äôt cry out. He never did. 

Once, Julian had been Alex‚Äôs hero‚Äîthe older brother who could do no wrong. Now he was a shadow of that man, a hollowed-out shell who survived on drugs.‚Äô  

Alex‚Äôs jaw clenched, rage boiling beneath the surface. His mother‚Äôs wide, pleading eyes locked on him, silently begging him to do something.  

Alex forced himself to keep his tone calm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle the investors,‚Äù he said, his words precise and deliberate. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt affect the meeting. You‚Äôll get the contract.‚Äù  

Charles finally let go of Julian‚Äôs hand, leaning back in his chair with a satisfied smirk. ‚ÄúGood. That‚Äôs what I like to hear.‚Äù  

Julian pulled his hand back quickly, cradling it under the table. His face was pale, but he didn‚Äôt say a word.  

Alex wanted to slam his fist through the table, but he didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs what Charles wanted‚Äîto provoke him, to control him.  

Instead, Alex picked up his phone and scrolled aimlessly, pretending to care about the plate of food in front of him.  

‚ÄúFix whatever mess you‚Äôve made with Zoe,‚Äù Charles added, his tone icy. ‚ÄúHer father and I are already discussing the wedding date. I won‚Äôt have your antics ruining our alliance.‚Äù  

Alex smirked, though it didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúOf course, Father,‚Äù he said, not looking up. He couldn‚Äôt exactly tell Charles the truth‚Äù 

His mind drift to that server girl 

Turner‚Äîthe fiery server girl who‚Äôd told him off at the bus stop. He hated to admit it, but her rejection had stung. Most people in Willowcrest would‚Äôve jumped at his offer, yet she‚Äôd turned him down without a second thought.  

Something about her had gotten under his skin.  

‚ÄúDid you hear me, Alexander?‚Äù Charles barked, snapping him out of his thoughts.  

Alex slipped his phone into his pocket and stood abruptly. ‚ÄúLoud and clear, Father. Enjoy your dinner, Blackwells.‚Äù  

Without another word, he strode out of the dining room.  

The cold night air hit him like a slap as he stepped outside. He leaned against his sleek car, running a hand through his hair. He needed to cool off.  

His phone buzzed in his pocket.  

Pulling it out, he glanced at the screen, his heart drops. It was a text message, and it was from Turner.  

‚ÄòI‚Äôll do it.‚Äô

Alex stared at the message, his heart thudding in his chest. For a moment, he didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt breathe.  

He loves challenges but getting entangled with a Turner is a challenge he had no interest in taking part in.

He wished she had said no.

Let The Game Begin
The balcony of the Blackwell Grand Hotel overlooked a city alive with wealth, secrets, and power plays. Alex stood with a glass of wine in hand, the chilled night air brushing against his skin. Beside him, Zoe leaned in, her arms draped around his waist as if she were staking a claim.  

""How long do you plan on playing this game?"" He asked.

Zoe chuckled softly, her lips brushing against his ear. ""It's getting very interesting, Alexander. Don‚Äôt ruin the fun.""  

He hummed, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, his eyes fixed on the horizon. His thoughts drifted to the server girl.

""I can‚Äôt believe she agreed so quickly,"" Zoe said, breaking into his thoughts.  

""I told you, she's a Turner,"" Alex replied, his tone dismissive.  

Zoe tilted her head, her blonde hair cascading over her shoulder as she studied him. ""Seriously, babe, bribing her with money should be considered cheating. Where‚Äôs the challenge in that?""  

Alex turned his head slightly, giving her a sharp glance. ""No rules against it, Zoe. And what did you expect? That I‚Äôd sweet-talk her into a date? Casual conversation with her is painful enough. I offered what Turners are slaves to‚Äîthe one thing they respond to."" His lips curled into a smirk. ""And like the perfect bait, she took it.""  

Zoe shivered, but not from the cold. Her smile widened, her eyes glittering with mischief. ""God, babe, your hatred for them gives me chills. I mean, I get it. You should hate them, but... it‚Äôs not like the whole family wronged you. Her brother was the only one who got involved with Julian.""  

Alex‚Äôs expression hardened, his sharp jawline tightening. His voice was cold and deliberate. ""And what is her brother, Zoe?""  

""A Turner,"" she whispered with a wicked smile, clearly pleased with his reaction. ""But babe, I have to admit‚Äîwatching you squirm every time you talk about her makes this game so much more entertaining. Your pain and discomfort? Pure gold.""  

Alex didn‚Äôt respond. He drained the rest of his wine and turned his gaze back to the city, his thoughts darker than the night sky.  

‚Äî

Mia stood behind the bar at Casa Lounge, wiping down glasses and trying to ignore the twisting in her stomach. It had been two days since she‚Äôd last seen Alexander Blackwell, and she wasn‚Äôt sure if the relief or disappointment was stronger.

His message still lingered in her mind, taunting her.

Three dates. Five thousand per date.

It wasn‚Äôt normal. Nothing about it was normal. What kind of man paid that much money for a date? Who even pays for a date?

She paused mid-wipe, her reflection in the glass catching her attention. She didn‚Äôt need this kind of chaos in her life.

The door to Casa Lounge swung open. Mia turned her head and froze.

Alexander Blackwell

He wasn‚Äôt alone. His two friends, Lucas and Sam, flanked him, laughing at something she couldn‚Äôt hear. But Alex‚Äôs gaze was locked on her the moment he entered the bar.

Mia felt her heart lurch in her chest, and her hands gripped the counter to keep herself steady. She couldn‚Äôt move. She couldn‚Äôt look away. He was walking toward her, his dark, commanding presence drawing the eyes of everyone in the lounge.

Her throat went dry as he closed the distance between them.

‚ÄúTomorrow after work,‚Äù Alex said, his voice low and smooth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pick you up.‚Äù

That was it. No explanation, no pleasantries. Just a statement delivered with absolute confidence.

Before Mia could find her voice, he turned and walked to the back corner of the lounge, where his friends were already settling into a booth.

Mia exhaled sharply, her grip on the counter tightening. Her knees felt like jelly, and she was sure her face was flushed.

‚ÄúWhat was that about?‚Äù Emily, her coworker, whispered from behind her, nudging her with an elbow.

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Mia said quickly, her voice shaky.

Emily raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúNothing? That was Alexander Blackwell. He doesn‚Äôt just walk up to people, Mia.‚Äù

‚ÄúDrop it,‚Äù Mia muttered, focusing on the glass in her hand. But her heart was pounding so hard it felt like it might leap out of her chest.

She glanced over at the booth where Alex sat with his friends. He didn‚Äôt look her way again, laughing at something his friend had said, but she couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that he was completely aware of her every move.

I do gig work only. I don't really bother with small events since it works only with big events.

(all numbers are without VAT)

If I have 8 hours of sales and all day a line, non stop making coffee, I make \~950‚Ç¨ revenue. I don't think much more is really possible.

My average this year is \~770‚Ç¨ per day, last year \~560‚Ç¨

So this is a graph which shows my net per day on the y axis (after substracting all costs) dependant on the yearly revenue (x-axis). Costs include only costs of doing business (my wage is not included). Basically it's like gross salary for the IRS.

[https://imgur.com/a/oi-KMxPDDF](https://imgur.com/a/oi-KMxPDDF)

I don't think way more than 770 average is possible, and I need to be really picky with gigs for that.

So if I can keep my 770 average, I can't go higher than 450 net/day; 550 average is no more than 320/day; 350 average is no more than 200 per sales day.

And it needs to cover my other work like finding gigs, and all other work overhead.

I'm not that mobile that I can hit on multiple locations a day

My cart is really small so I can't offer much else

Hours are long

I've been really picky this year with gigs since it's actually really easy to have a below 300‚Ç¨ day

From the top of my head I wouldn't know a location which would be profitable during normal hours

Like RN I'm thinking more about keeping my recurring gigs, optimize it for chill work days (like weddings and corporate events) and then trying to start something else with higher glass ceiling or no glass ceiling at all. Or do you think it's solid for such a gig?

Like my issue is that I don't really want a side gig, I want actually something which could develop into something better

With 550 average I would barely be able to pay a single employee. So I would NEED something like 750 average to even hire someone (like if I had a location to sell mo-fr)

Fear of failure was my driving force, and still kind of is I suppose. My older sibling and I lived together for over 2 years while I did school, but we barely hung out at all because I spent all my time studying. Even though we were inseparable as kids. I think I was a pretty prickly roommate. I would feel exasperated whenever he left coffee grounds on the counter or some dishes in the sink.  Even when we did hang out, I would be thinking of all the stuff I had to do, to the point that hanging out felt like a waste of my time, even though I didn't want to feel that way. I started getting medication for ADHD this year, which helped me a lot, and I think I could've been a better sister if I had gotten help sooner.

Enjoy some massive metal circles and a gray couch as some examples, as well as some clutter due to the space that's currently being taken up by what I can only assume was a viking longtable and an opaque glass coffee table. The only thing that would stay is the desk in the corner, all the dimensions are in cm. 

I included the dimensions from FloorPlan, some pictures to better convey the space (but haven't covered it exhaustively since we're planning on changing everything) along with some rough ideas (please ignore the colors, these are just to make it feel a bit more alive). As you can tell, we hope to make both a dining room and living room space, and we're thinking of sundering the big black metal circles and getting a projector + screen instead to take advantage of the high ceilings. 

The biggest hurdle right now is what layout would make most sense. We live on the top floor of an old building, and we realistically have one shot of renting the machine that will allow old furniture out and new furniture in, so we're trying to plan as much as possible. If it helps to know, the ceilings are extremely high. We like mid-century aesthetics and we're hoping to make the place feel much more alive with some color. 

As you might also be able to tell, we have no idea what we're doing.

I go to Lawson state for welding, have a part-time job at Lowe's, and doordash on the side. I am a workaholic (I have my reasons) so I would like something not too physical due to my day to day life being super physical. 

I'm 5,10 150lb and can reliably and repeatedly lift 70+ pounds a shift. I have customer service experience working a seafood clerk position at a local grocery store. I also know food safety practices due to that position and others at that store (meat department, stocker, bagger). 

I can also do light handy work if provided the tools(most of mine are catered moreso to weldingü´§). I know the bare minimum for automotive but I'm able to learn more if the pay is right (it's not really hard just extremely tedious so I prefer not to).

As you probably guessed by now, I know how to weld. I can do GMAW(favorite),SMAW, and FCAW(Hate but good at it). I also know how to fit pipe but the complete welding of it is something I still need experience with. I have all tools PPE and welding related except for the machine and a torch. 

I have a personal laptop and vehicle and have a PS5 (Incase you want to play with someone or need a booster or choach or whatever.) I also have a intense love for ALL animals (not insects) so I definitely don't mind pet walking or sitting for someone.

I'm currently in the market for a chill cafe job or welding gig. Hopefully it can be something to replace doordashing since all the wear on my car annoys me (remember I don't like fixing them but can).

I'm also decent at math and enjoy a good cup of coffee and tea. If you read this far thanks and hope for recommendations or DMS soonüòÅ. Have a blessed day.

Ps. no moving jobs. I'm strong and fit but not thaaat much. They really built different.",5,1756757519.0,Birmingham,13,0.7,False
