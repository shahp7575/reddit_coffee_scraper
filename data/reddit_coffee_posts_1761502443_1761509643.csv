I've got almost all of the gems, but I don't know where to give them to her.   I tried to give them to her at the Tavern, but I had already accidentally gave her a coffee and I couldn't give another gift on the same day.    I tried to drop it off at her house at the next day but that didn't work either.   Where should I put the gems?  PS.

What would you suggest I do to **improve** from this point?

1. I had a busy Saturday doing service for my community with a chunk of physical activity.

2. I had a restful day with minor domestic duties e.g. groceries, playing with my kids etc on Sunday.

3. My watch tells me a I had a great sleep, lots of REM and full body battery.

  
Yet I woke up today wanting to stay in bed. I got up regardless, had a black coffee, red a book, did some stretching, shower etc.

I have a neverending amount of work to do at work, but this isn't the first time in my life that's been at play. I am however feeling super drained.

  
What are you're tips for today and longer term to lift out of this?

Looking for a place that's not Shimla / Manali crowded but still accessible easily via overnight buses from Delhi NCR.

Could you guys please suggest something?

I am thinking either Bir, or somewhere between shimla & Narkanda. Please suggest if you guys know some place better. Or suggestions for places beyond shimla, any cool places to stay with nice views , but budget friendly.

We don't want to do extensive sight seeing, maybe sit at a place with view and read / have coffee and some small nature hike.. that's it.

Planning around mid November, reach there by Saturday morning and leave for delhi by Sunday night.

1oguk6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1oguk6f/i_have_a_crush_on_my_childhood_friend_that_i/,I have a crush on my childhood friend that I rejected as a kid,"I (f28) recently reached out to my childhood friend (m28) on Facebook to reconnect with him after losing contact with him for 16 years. We have been Facebook friends since 2017. When I first reached out to him on facebook a month ago i asked him what he has been up to he messaged me back five minutes later. A few days later I asked him if he wanted to catch up with me and the following day he said sure. We met up a few days later at a coffee shop and he was nervous, he didn’t give eye contact, he was shy and did ask me a few questions and he did tell me about himself but I did most of the talking. We were at the coffee shop for about an hour or two. When I asked him if he would want to meetup again sometime he said, “Maybe, I’ll think about it.” I’ve been messaging him a couple times since then and he has been quick to respond. I asked him a few days ago if he would want to meetup again sometime soon and he messaged me back, “Maybe. I’ll think about it.” I messaged him back, “Thanks for thinking about it. No rush.” I’m going to leave him alone until he messages me back. I enjoyed seeing him again and I would like to continue spending time with me if he wants to continue spending time with me.

Additional context: When we were kids I found out he had a crush on me and I rejected him. One day in middle school my bully told me that my guy friend had a crush on me and asked me if I had a crush on him. I told my bully that I didn’t have a crush on my guy friend and then I told one of my other friends and her and I went to go tell my guy friend that I only liked him as a friend. I honestly think that if I had heard from my guy friend that he had a crush on me instead of my bully I think I would’ve handled the situation differently. I also had two crushes on him as a kid but we had crushes on each other at different times so it didn’t work out. The first crush I had on him was before we were friends and the second crush I had on him was after I told him I only liked him as a friend so I thought that that would make things weird so I didn’t end up telling him. I also regret rejecting him when we were kids and I have a crush on him now. I thought it might be best to start off with becoming friends with him again first. I have always cared about him and I think I always liked him as a kid but I didn’t want to ruin the friendship and I’ve been wanting him back in my life but I feel like a jerk because I rejected him as a kid and as a kid I was being selfish and didn’t even really understand that I probably hurt his feelings when I rejected him. Now I understand that when I rejected him it probably really hurt his feelings. If he does want to meetup with me again I’ll apologize to him in person for rejecting him as kids. If he doesn’t want to meetup again then I’ll send him an apology message. I do hope he gives me another chance but I’m not sure if that’s going to happen or not. Do you think he might want me to be in his life now?",1,1761509344.0,selfhelp,1,1.0,False

This pocket of northern New Jersey is known for its friendly boroughs—compact, walkable towns that combine suburban peace with easy access to New York City.

Whether you’re [planning a move](https://www.movingofamerica.com/blog/category/move-planning/) or simply exploring where life might feel a little more connected, this guide compares Bergen County’s best small towns and explains why compact living is making a big comeback.

**Why Choose Small Town Life in Bergen County?**

With over 70 municipalities, Bergen County offers a diverse mix of urban centers and suburban retreats. Yet, it’s the smaller boroughs—those under two square miles—that often win people’s hearts. These towns tend to have strong civic engagement, active local businesses, and a genuine sense of belonging.

Living in a compact community means your favorite coffee shop, school, and park are often within walking distance. It’s a lifestyle that emphasizes simplicity, safety, and connection—all without losing the conveniences of the metro area.

**The Charm of Compact Communities**

Small towns in Bergen County carry an old-fashioned appeal that’s hard to replicate. They blend historic architecture, locally owned shops, and tight-knit social networks that encourage residents to get involved.

Many of these boroughs emerged in the late 19th century as railroad suburbs of New York City. Today, they retain that same commuter-friendly design—with a modern twist of cultural diversity and upgraded amenities.

From annual block parties to holiday parades, the sense of pride in these communities runs deep.

**Benefits of Compact Living**

Small towns like these offer benefits that go beyond square footage.

1. Walkability and Accessibility:

Compact towns make it easy to walk or bike to schools, cafes, and local businesses.

2. Stronger Sense of Community:

Smaller populations foster tighter social networks—neighbors genuinely know one another.

3. Lower Stress, Higher Quality of Life:

Less congestion, more green spaces, and a slower pace of life help residents unwind.

4. Safety and Stability:

Many small Bergen County towns consistently rank among the safest in New Jersey.

5. Convenient Commutes:

All of these boroughs are within 30–45 minutes of Manhattan by car or NJ Transit.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Why Small Towns Are Ideal for Families and Professionals**

Families appreciate the proximity to top-rated schools, parks, and community centers, while professionals love being near key business hubs in Hackensack, Paramus, and NYC.

These compact towns also offer affordable housing relative to larger Bergen County suburbs like Ridgewood or Tenafly. Residents often get more space, a yard, and that priceless small-town calm—all while staying plugged into the metro economy.

Local insight: In many of these boroughs, residents have lived for generations—proof of the loyalty and belonging these communities inspire.

1ogucic,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ogucic/early_red_flags_with_an_avoidant/,Early red flags with an avoidant,"I am 33M she is 27F we had a period of long distance (2 hours) whilst I was at university and on my final year we moved in together and then the final 2 / 3 years I was staying at her parents and sometimes going home to my parents for a week or two. I recently got a new job and needed to pass probation so we could buy a home and the day after passing she broke-up with me (also 2 weeks after my dogs death).

Met her randomly in a bar one night, things were great at the start although quite rocky as I am an AP and she was DA / FA - but of course I have only just learnt about attachment styles and it all makes sense now.

After a few months I met her family and everything was good, then I wanted her to meet my family and she did everything she could to avoid it by creating small arguments, excuses but then eventually just pulled away and then came back like normal after the weekend was over so she got out of it - I thought this was weird and just carried on as normal.

We then had a trip to Paris for a few days and we had a great time and I went back to university and she went home and I tried messaging her but she was very distance and didn't want to talk and she then ghosted me for a few days and I was left in limbo and again a few days later she comes around and we 'make up'.

Other scenarios include:

* When moved in final year of university I asked for more sex and she got mad at me for it and it didn't improve and I just suppressed my needs
* Stonewalling - one instance was a week before the breakup I woken up tired and she was on her phone reading an article to me and I said 'yeah' and she told me to 'fuck off' and I asked why she saying that and she ignored me which was very frustrating
* My dog who I have had for 15 years was dying and a week before her death I was on the phone to her and insecurely asked 'do you still wanna be with me?' and she shutdown and her words were 'I can't deal with your emotions right now' and wanted to hang up but I calmed her down
* Random shutdowns - just randomly not wanna speak to people (sometimes aimed at me and sometimes her friends / family)
* No compromise - I did 95% of the effort in the relationship I was always travelling to see her whilst she probably seen my family 3 - 4 times a year, wanted specific house location, car model, dog breed - absolutely everything
* Hated conflict - would shutdown and no matter how much I try and talk she would start ignoring me and push me away until the next day
* Bottled feelings / emotions - never really spoke about feelings and her words 'why would I speak about them as no-one can do anything about them'. Her brother was diagnosed with a brain tumour 6 months ago and is waiting results and she kept everything to herself
* Fault finding - this was especially obvious near the end of the relationship... She went back to nightclub / bar photos of me in university 2-3 years ago trying to find suspicious photo of me with a girl so it's a green light to end (I think that was her mindset)?
* Nitpicking - during the end when she was breaking up she said everything I was doing even little things that normally didn't effect her were now annoying her
* Unsure - when I went to pick my things up 2 weeks after breakup I said why don't we give it another chance and have coffee or something and she kept saying 'I don't know' 'not sure' 'don't want to lead you on incase I change my mind'
* Low libido - similarly to the final year of university after we moved in it hasn't improved in that 3 years after and I just got used to it, I remember a few months ago being rejected 3 times in 3 days with the excuses 'I'm tired what about tomorrow?' and I just ended up crying alone.

At the end she gave me random reasons such as because I was 50/50 on kids and used to say 'if you want kids then I will have them' that was a red flag as she wants someone who fully wants kids (although never been a problem for her for the past 7 years).

Overall I am still obviously missing her but I feel the worst thing after a breakup is regrets but in this instance I don't feel like I did too much wrong and I did make much more effort than her in a lot of aspects. Went out with my friend this weekend and had a great time and still do very well with the opposite sex so that's good and at times feel like this was a blessing for it to happen now rather than in 10 years time where we have bigger commitments (house, kids, marriage) etc.

It's just a shame I never seen this coming, the early red flags I simply put down to maturity and thought she would grow out of it but clearly not.",1,1761508828.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

We think we will never be ""that guy"" to have been cheated on and betrayed by the woman we chose.... and here I am.

I was with my STBXW for 10 years.... married just shy of 5. I can honestly look back and say I felt happy in our marriage and we had some great memories. Only thing I can really own up to is I let things slip into routine this past year.... not dating her enough like I used to, not getting flowers and things like that. I do recognize that.

At the beginning of the year, my wife lost a significant amount of weight on a medication. I was so happy for her since I know she struggled a bit with body image esteem. It started with subtle comments like ""this man at Starbucks said I was beautiful this morning and bought me coffee!"". It started to escalate little by little with comments she was making to me hinting at opening up the marriage.

I was away on a 3 day work trip back in April. She left the house late and came home at 2 AM. My Ring camera alerted me of this. I was tossing and turning in bed thinking of what to say. I went to go check the camera footage again...... she deleted it. I called her out on it and the comments she was making up to this point, she deflected and love bombed saying ""it's not what you think.., I love you so much"". I come home expecting to have a conversation about it, she looked stone cold. No emotion. She flat out said she has been unhappy for about a year and will be filing for divorce. No chance of reconciliation, and she has taken zero accountability for anything. She gave a completely bogus excuse for the deleted camera footage.

She never came to me at any point in the past year to have a conversation. We even had a trip planned not long after all this happened (cancelled obviously).

She lived here in my home for about a month in the spare bedroom. During that time, she was dressing up, going out every night, talking to men on the phone in front of me. Wild stuff. My friend told me she posted a selfie saying ""#hideyourhusbands"" and a selfie celebrating the divorce ""post breakup glowup!"".

She moved out a few months ago. I am fighting for my home in a no-fault state. I am in a much better spot now. Divorce is not final yet but getting there. No kids THANK GOODNESS!

The hardest thing I am dealing with still is the betrayal and the loss of my dogs. I would have loved to keep them but with my profession I can't properly care for them alone.

In court she enthusiastically said ""Hey so do you want to hear about Buddy (one of our dogs)!?"" I looked at her shocked and just said ""no"".

I have been hitting the gym, putting on muscle, been on a couple dates. Dating scene is really bad.... lots of ghosting.

She always struggled making any friends, always had issues with co-workers, had some childhood trauma, and I have seen her discard relatives on/off.... red flags I wish I never ignored.

I am 34, but guys that have gone thru this, how do you overcome the betrayal? We have been no-contact since she moved out.",2,1761508710.0,GuyCry,3,1.0,False

1ogu9ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1ogu9ns/how_can_i_improve_my_relationship_with_my_mom/,How can I improve my relationship with my mom (while living at home)?,"Hi everyone, I’m 26F and currently living at home with my parents. I love them and I’m grateful for everything they’ve done for me, but I’ve really been struggling with the lack of independence and the constant clashing - especially with my mom.  My parents are doing me a huge favor by letting me live at home. Culturally, it’s pretty normal for adult children to stay with their parents until they’re married or more established. That said, moving out isn’t realistic for me right now. I work in a very low-paying field and live in a high cost-of-living city. Staying home helps me save money, but I still need to figure out how to make this situation more livable and less emotionally draining.

I wish my relationship with my mom were better. Sometimes things are good, but other times it gets so tense that I just want to avoid her. I often feel isolated here. She can be very involved in my business- for example, she goes into my room to clean or change my sheets, usually while I’m at work (I work part remote, part in-office). I know her intentions are good, but it makes me feel like I don’t have any personal space.

She also tends to snap easily, and I’ll admit that I sometimes react the same way. When we argue, it can turn into a full-blown storm. I’ve been trying to assert more independence, but it’s tough because my family is so intertwined.

For instance, everything in our household is communal - whoever wakes up first makes coffee for everyone. Grocery shopping is done together. I can’t even buy certain things I like (like a big bag of spinach) because I’m the only one who’d eat it, and my mom thinks it’s wasteful. Growing up, it wasn’t really a thing to buy food just for one person - it was always all or nothing. I’m not sure if that’s a cultural or immigrant-family thing, but it makes it hard to have autonomy.

My mom also cooks for all of us - me, my dad, and herself. If I try to be more independent and make my own meals (like we’re roommates), she gets upset. She’ll say I’m wasting food or creating extra work. It’s the same with other household chores like laundry or cleaning; there are certain things she won’t let anyone else do.

I’m trying to be respectful and grateful, but also maintain my sanity and sense of adulthood. Has anyone else navigated this kind of dynamic with their parents? How did you set boundaries or improve the relationship without constant fighting or guilt?

I’ve tried bringing some of these things up to her, but she always gets defensive or snarky about it, as if I’m offending her just by trying to talk. It’s frustrating because I *wish* I could afford to move out, but I can’t right now. It’s not like this situation is amazing for me either. I feel stuck. I just want a little more space and understanding. ",1,1761508630.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

1ogu8ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1ogu8ts/dismissed_all_the_red_flags_early_on/,Dismissed all the red flags early on,"I am 33M she is 27F we had a period of long distance (2 hours) whilst I was at university and on my final year we moved in together and then the final 2 / 3 years I was staying at her parents and sometimes going home to my parents for a week or two. I recently got a new job and needed to pass probation so we could buy a home and the day after passing she broke-up with me (also 2 weeks after my dogs death).

Met her randomly in a bar one night, things were great at the start although quite rocky as I am an AP and she was DA / FA - but of course I have only just learnt about attachment styles and it all makes sense now.

After a few months I met her family and everything was good, then I wanted her to meet my family and she did everything she could to avoid it by creating small arguments, excuses but then eventually just pulled away and then came back like normal after the weekend was over so she got out of it - I thought this was weird and just carried on as normal.

We then had a trip to Paris for a few days and we had a great time and I went back to university and she went home and I tried messaging her but she was very distance and didn't want to talk and she then ghosted me for a few days and I was left in limbo and again a few days later she comes around and we 'make up'.

Other scenarios include:

* When moved in final year of university I asked for more sex and she got mad at me for it and it didn't improve and I just suppressed my needs
* Stonewalling - one instance was a week before the breakup I woken up tired and she was on her phone reading an article to me and I said 'yeah' and she told me to 'fuck off' and I asked why she saying that and she ignored me which was very frustrating
* My dog who I have had for 15 years was dying and a week before her death I was on the phone to her and insecurely asked 'do you still wanna be with me?' and she shutdown and her words were 'I can't deal with your emotions right now' and wanted to hang up but I calmed her down
* Random shutdowns - just randomly not wanna speak to people (sometimes aimed at me and sometimes her friends / family)
* No compromise - I did 95% of the effort in the relationship I was always travelling to see her whilst she probably seen my family 3 - 4 times a year, wanted specific house location, car model, dog breed - absolutely everything
* Hated conflict - would shutdown and no matter how much I try and talk she would start ignoring me and push me away until the next day
* Bottled feelings / emotions - never really spoke about feelings and her words 'why would I speak about them as no-one can do anything about them'. Her brother was diagnosed with brain tumour 6 months ago and is waiting for the results and keeps everything to herself
* Fault finding - this was especially obvious near the end of the relationship... She went back to nightclub / bar photos of me in university 2-3 years ago trying to find suspicious photo of me with a girl so it's a green light to end (I think that was her mindset)?
* Nitpicking - during the end when she was breaking up she said everything I was doing even little things that normally didn't effect her were now annoying her
* Unsure - when I went to pick my things up 2 weeks after breakup I said why don't we give it another chance and have coffee or something and she kept saying 'I don't know' 'not sure' 'don't want to lead you on incase I change my mind'
* Low libido - similarly to the final year of university after we moved in it hasn't improved in that 3 years after and I just got used to it, I remember a few months ago being rejected 3 times in 3 days with the excuses 'I'm tired what about tomorrow?' and I just ended up crying alone.

At the end she gave me random reasons such as because I was 50/50 on kids and used to say 'if you want kids then I will have them' that was a red flag as she wants someone who fully wants kids (although never been a problem for her for the past 7 years).

Sporadic lurker, wanted to try my own methods before making a post. Feel like I have tried everything and all roads lead to Rome. 

Mother is raging narc with sprinkles of religious psychosis. Examples of latter are few but consider: for some days/weeks she chooses to roleplay happy families and I go along with this, but then randomly God will speak to her and reveal that I am secretly plotting against her back to runaway and leave her. What follows is her typical display of verbal abuse, running around the house being loud, shouting about me, and plays gospel music loudly, pretends to speak in tongues. This continues for a few days then she randomly will decide that none of it ever happened and we are best friends that should go out for lunch this weekend. Religious psychosis is always present but less theatrical. 

Regarding the former... well. I can only try my best to summarize what I go through:

* Typical cyclical structure on repeat: we are best friends and I must play along, until she decides she hates me. Rinse, repeat. Rinse, repeat. Rinse, repeat. 
* Makes demands and when I meet them, instantly moves the bar up. My duties started off by being clean the kitchen every day. We have now reached the point where I clean the house alone every week plus I need to clean certain rooms during the week, too. Most recent addition is that I must do the weekly clean on Friday. Why? Because cleaning makes too much noise. Once she got home and I had cleaned the house before the weekend and was asleep, then the argument was that I'm 'a psychopath' because I didn't cook her a meal to come home to and stayed up to see her come home. Grown ass mother talking to her daughter, by the way. 
* Regarding cleaning, she purposely makes a mess every day for me to clean up. Literally throws the spoon she uses to mix her coffee on the table. Oil splatters everywhere around where she used the hob. In the bathroom, doesnt flush - EVER (??), leaves trash and used hairbands, hair brushes in and around the sink, despite bin and storage being ON THE WAY OUT OF THE BATHROOM. 
* Mental games. Real example: 'Don't forget to text your father for father's day' (something I would have never remembered to do without her reminder). Later asks me whether I did it. After I said yes, it was a 3 day rampage about how dare I text my father but not so much as buy her flowers for mothers day, how could I prefer my father over her, I am souring her soul. 
* I only got 1 gift for my birthday. Would have been fine with that, except it was a gift for her. She collects orchids, takes pride in caring for them. I have never expressed interest in any flower. Can you guess what I got for my birthday this year? I got an orchid. It's kept in her room. 
* I'm vegan and she regularly tries to make me food with non-vegan items and tries to lie to me about it. Also over-indulges on animal meat and constantly talks about cooking meat, eating meat, mocks the noises the animal she's cooking makes when she's cooking and I'm around. 
* Makes snide comments about me, but as if they're about other people. As in, she shit talks people to me but refers specifically to things about them that I've also done. 'Can't believe X did that, you have to be a certain type of crazy to do that.', 'Well at least Y didn't do V, at least she had the guts to see it through.'. 
* Accuses me of doing drugs. I do nOT DO FUCKING DRUGS BUT AT THIS RATE I MIGHT PICK IT UP. Goes beyond 'you do drugs'. I get bombarded with texts and voice messages. Real example of her psycho ramblings (translated), to set the scene I had come home after failing a workout at the gym due to an infection, said I was heading back out to hit a walk to make myself feel better. Which I did, and also called a suicide prevention hotline: 'You have disgusted me enough in this lifetime. I play dumb because I need to live and survive to honor my obligations. You are now a woman with \[retracted\] years of age, it is past the time for you to get out of the energy of stupidity and insanity. At times our house smells of weed \[impossible, I DO NOT SMOKE WEED\]. I say nothing because you are scandalous and I do not want that for my life anymore. There does not exist anymore apologies for your wrong choices in life. I will disappear from your life \[feel free\] and you will never again hear from me \[you'd be doing me a favor\]. You better stop thinking that I'm stupid and dumb because I SEE YOU. I do not even need to look at you to see you \[she means God shows her\]. Your face does not even tremble when telling lies. The entire world has changed and you are still in the vibe of lying. I AM TIRED'.

The issue is that I feel like I have tried most methods and they do not work. When I was grey rocking, she became/acted majorly depressed. Would only speak about dying, saying she has nothing to live for. The outbursts seemed more prominent. But then when I pretend to like her, I have to dedicate a lot of my energy. I have to share parts of my life which she then uses against me and SABOTAGES ME and just sucks the fucking life and enjoyment of anything I have left. And the abuse hits closer when she knows what I'm currently doing, etc... 

I'm a recent graduate, currently unemployed, looking for jobs always. The main issue is the weekend when she's home. I'm considering going back to hospitality just for the weekends so I can be away from her and also begin to generate money so I can fucking GET OUT. I also worry she will attempt to control my money when I start earning.

Learn more about our flexible approach to where we work.
## **Overview**
Every year, people across the world spend nearly one trillion dollars on groceries. It’s an industry that’s been around for centuries. Food itself, however, has been a constant in people’s lives since the beginning of time. Yes, sustenance is essential, but it’s also much more than that. Food can be a part of a daily ritual or a special moment that resonates with people on a meaningful and emotional level. It can be a much-needed break in a long day, a taste that brings back memories, a creative experiment, a shared meal with loved ones, or even comfort during a hard time. Whether it’s a special occasion or an everyday occurrence, it should always be easy for people to get the ingredients they need.
The Instacart Design Team is dedicated to making grocery shopping effortless for everyone and finding solutions to large-scale opportunities that will forever change the way people feed themselves and their loved ones. We’re a four sided marketplace and design for the needs of Consumer, Shoppers, Retailers, and Advertisers.
The Instacart design team focuses on designing, building & landing multi-platform product experiences that make grocery shopping effortless and create economic opportunity for our shoppers. The team crafts solutions for large-scale challenges that will change the way people feed themselves and their loved ones. 
## **About the Role**
The Staff Content Designer is one of our highest-impact roles on the Platform design team. You will serve as a Content Design lead and work fluidly across multiple design disciplines to deliver exceptional experiences for our retailers with a heavy bias toward content strategy, writing, taxonomy, conversational design, AI system prompting, and scalable content patterns that evolve our design system. This role requires you to develop strategic and intuitive self-service experiences that enable retailers to configure and operate their businesses while gaining insights into their performance.
You will have the opportunity to shape and drive innovative design solutions across a variety of impactful initiatives. These include retailer-facing platform-wide core features that elevate usability and efficiency, such as information architecture, navigation, notifications, roles and permissions, and inline education systems. You'll play a pivotal role in evolving retailer operations tools for catalog management, order management, and fulfillment, empowering retailers to succeed at scale. Additionally, you’ll contribute to crafting seamless and engaging user experiences in our marketplace app, focusing on loyalty programs, deals, coupons, and more that delight millions of users. As a general standard for all our designers and leaders, we are looking for people who thrive on building a strong design culture, lead with empathy and collaboration, and are committed to pushing the boundaries of quality and innovation in everything we ship.

I said that’s totally fine, because it genuinely is and she added:

I replied politely, told her the same, and left it there.

Thing is, I really vibed with her and keep thinking it might be worth a sober, low-pressure 2nd meet (like grabbing a coffee), in whatever direction it might lead, nothing, casual or serious, since we both are not looking for anything in particular so I’m fine if she’s not into it, but part of me feels like there’s no harm in sending a short text next week like something casual, not pushy.

During my time at uni I tried to befriend lots of people but never quite managed it. Except with this one colleague I really clicked with (also neurodivergent, ADHD). I found it really easy to talk to her, we talked at uni and also through text, spent time together in cafes, libraries, parks etc. I liked her a lot honestly. 

When I finally graduated I was sooo burnt out and just absolutely done with everything I just went back home, never said a word to anyone back at uni.
Almost a year later I texted this former colleague asking about something and she kinda attempted to reconnect I think? Asked if we could go out for a coffee or something. We never got round to doing that, as I was living quite far from where I went to uni. 

So there was that. Yesterday, I kid you not, yesterday, more than 1.5 years later, I realized that I was friends with this person and she probably felt confused by my very sudden disappearance. 

I think what I have always thought of as friends was actually what people generally consider *close friends*. Like I actually had something with this person, we were casual friends at the very least and I fucked it up without even realizing it. 

I'm so mad at myself but also feel bad now because looking at this in this light, my behaviour must have seemed confusing at best and shitty at worst.

For context: this weekend was Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) — a full week of electronic music events, DJs from all over the world, afterparties, etc.

Friday – Black Coffee
I didn’t have anyone to go with, so I connected with a girl from a Facebook group. She was already inside with her friend when I arrived. We spent over an hour searching for each other in that packed venue. The night felt tense before it even started.

And the set… I expected warm, danceable Afro House. Instead it was super minimal deep afro. No groove, no drop, no release. Everyone was just standing still pretending it was a transcendent experience. I felt nothing. I left disappointed.

Saturday – Gordo
I decided to go alone — and the night turned into chaos.

Traffic was insane. Cars driving the wrong way, no control, security giving wrong directions. I drove in circles 30+ minutes, finally parked near some random furniture warehouse area and walked because taxis couldn’t get through.

On my way there, I started doubting going alone.
My ex (we were together 4 years) was at another ADE event that night with a group — his friend, the friend’s girlfriend, and the cousin of that friend. So keep in mind, he’s not with just “the boys”. 

During our relationship, he always said:

“I don’t like going out. That’s not my thing.”

Since we broke up, he goes out constantly.

And here’s the part that hurts:
The last two weeks, we were actually spending almost every day together because we live in the same building.

But when I hinted at joining their event, he said things like:

“It’s not really your vibe,”
“There’s not much space,”
“It’s just random people.”

Not a direct “don’t come” —
but very intentionally discouraging.
A soft rejection that still cuts deep.

So I kept going to Gordo alone.

When I arrived, the event had stopped letting people in. People outside started forcing doors open, meaning people were going in with zero security checks. No bag check. Nothing.
Police pushing crowds back. Chaos.
It felt unsafe. Hundreds of people couldn’t get inside.

I was standing there fully dressed, exhausted and alone.

So I called him — because I didn’t want to be in that moment alone.
I thought maybe after everything:

“Come join us”
would finally happen.

Instead he hung up on me.
Then turned his phone off.

He was out with a group.
There was space.
But I still wasn’t welcome.

That’s when it hit me:
When I needed someone — there was genuinely no one.

My closest friend in the past stole from me.
Every friend group I’ve ever been in was always pairs — and I was the third wheel.
Now it’s Sunday, the final day of ADE and I have no one to go with, AGAIN.

Two nights.
No dancing.
No joy.
Just stress, loneliness, exhaustion — and the realization I’ve been avoiding:

I am actually on my own right now.

I don’t know what I want from posting this.
I think I just needed someone to hear it.


If you read this, thank you.

1. ive been hearing his name a lot for about a year, and for the past two weeks have been having headaches and a voice in my head that wasn’t me told me it was him trying to contact me. has anyone else experienced this?

2. i’ve invoked him three times now, each time i get headaches and feel tired and drained. when i repeat his enn i’m almost out of breath. is this common?

3. how long should i keep offerings on his altar? as well as what offerings should i give him, so far i’ve given him a cinnamon stick, a red 7 day candle, two dragons blood votive candles, a cinnamon stick, a heart shaped carnelian, coffee with cinnamon and dragons blood incense.

4. how do i know my invocations worked and he is willing to work with me? so far ive had his candle flicker whenever i say his enn or say ave rex asmodeus, as well as what i experienced as described in question two.

5. can he contact me through tarot cards?

6. people reference him speaking to them, how do i get to that point?

7. how do i get better at meditating with him?

8. what rituals can i do with him?

9. when is an appropriate time to evoke rather than invoke?

Issue just started (working previously),"I have had a Breville Bambino for about 2 years. The machine has always worked well for me. I use a Normcore 54mm bottomless portafilter, an IMS precision basket, tamp, puck screen, etc. 

  
My grinder is a Baratza Encore, I usually grind in setting 3-5, depending on the coffee. This has always been fine enough and sometimes too fine. 

  
For the past 2 years I have been using this set up to make great espresso. For the past month or so something seems to have changed. Even when I set my grinder to 1 (the most fine setting), the Bambino is acting as if I am not grinding fine enough. 

  
The shots are pulling extremely fast, and water sprays out form the sides of the portafilter and makes a mess. I have not changed anything in my set up so I am really unsure why this is happening. I have tried running a clean cycle on the machine, which did nothing. I have tried without the puck screen which also did nothing.

But every so often, on my ""off time"", I'll mention how I'm free this weekend, that we should grab lunch (on me), watch a movie at home, whatever. And sometimes its met with a ""for sure! Let's do it!"" But then day of- radio silence. 

Ok, that's fine i guess because in a day, I know I'll be back to working my life away and who knows when I'll have another day ""off"".

Or if its someone i used to see all the time (like my entire weekends were dedicated to them, month after month), I have cut back on it bc it was spent doing their chores, doing their house work, their yard work while my own piled up. If I'm not willing to help them with that, it feels as if they don't want to hang out with me. I've invited them in/ out multiple times and it's been flat out denied (let's go shoot pool- why would I wanna do that... let's go to dinner- this is news to me, I'm not going but you can take the kids). 

In those moments, I just want someone to spend time with but when do I stop asking about it? Do i stop asking if they're up for a visit/ up to do something? Do it just accept that they're 'text only' people that I guess I'll never see again? One- it's been almost a year and that's only bc i was invited to their child's bday party. 

The other gets ""mad"" that I don't text often but after the regular ""what have you been up to"" communication, it dies off and work once again takes over. I can't even be like ""so excited to catch up with you, let's get coffee on Sunday"" bc i know Sunday, it'll be silence. 

Thing is, I know this is a me problem- I'm the common denominator here. I guess i just don't know how to let go bc i feel guilty... idek why I feel guilty, but I do... so i gotta respond to the text, hope we'll hang out and be sad that we never do. ",1,1761505960.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False
1ogt5g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/XXRunning/comments/1ogt5g8/what_should_i_change_for_my_next_race/,What should I change for my next race?,"Hi all! I recently ran my first half marathon - I’m so glad I did it, and crossing that finish line was amazing, but it did not exactly go according to plan either, haha. I’d love any insight about changes to make when I train for my next half!

Many of my easy runs while training were around a 9:45 min/mile pace, with faster training runs around 8:15-9:00, so I thought aiming for a sub 2 half might be doable. I ended up running a 2:08:00 (hit my B goal!), but I had some intermittent nasty stomach cramps, nausea, and chills that slowed me down and made parts of the run much less fun. The weather was in the 40s/50s and I ran in shorts and a t shirt, so I don’t think the chills were heatstroke? Pretty much the whole thing felt a lot harder than my longest training run (10 miles, following a marathon handbook plan). I felt great afterwards, though! Thirsty, but bounced back quick. 

For hydration/nutrition info: i did a one day carb load at 500 g carbs, which I also practiced first before my 10 mile runs. I had breakfast ~2 hrs pre race (PB toast + banana + coffee) and then had one Huma gel every 30 min while running (uncaffeinated at 30 and 90 min, 25 mg caffeine at 60 min). I used salt sticks and totaled ~300 mg sodium per hour. I brought a half liter of water with me during the race and found myself getting noticeably thirsty. I took 2 small water cups from aid stations as well. I had a sip of Gatorade at an aid station, but otherwise all my nutrition was practiced before hand (and I’ve never had stomach issues with Gatorade in normal life). 

Some things I think weren’t ideal, in retrospect:
- the huma gels have 4% of your daily fiber requirements per gel…so I had 12% of my daily fiber while running 
- my warmup was cut short due to long bathroom lines, but the lines were so long that I also didn’t get a chance to pee pre-run and had to take a pee break mid course. Maybe TMI, but with the cramps I thought I might need a BM, but I never did, even hours post-run.
- my thirst/chills makes me think I might’ve been dehydrated? I thought my nutrition/hydration was enough, but maybe I was wrong? Especially want feedback here!!
- I started too fast out the gate - I was trying to keep my pace for a sub 2 and my body couldn’t manage after the first couple miles…so maybe that jump started the cramps?

In the “maybe relevant” category, I took Advil the day before my race, which I have not mixed with previous long runs but tolerate fine in day to day life. I slept well the night before but was pretty nervous ahead of the race!

Thanks in advance for any insight! I’ll be resting up and recovering for the time being 😊

I haven't been there for all that long and I feel like I've been in the team since the beginning.

I had a breakdown one day because I was super overwhelmed with with and was dealing some stuff at home, and he brought me a water bottle, kleenex and just stayed with me until I was better. Keeps finding excuses to talk, to be close, lots more eye contact and much longer ones too. Then couple nights ago, we were about to leave from work and he asked if I had a sweater because it was cold outside, I told him no and he just gave me his sweater, saying that its his favorite, its really warm and comfortable and that i could just bring it back to him the next day. I've asked some of my friends and they think he's just being nice and caring since I'm the only woman but I feel like he likes me and is trying to keep things professional since we work together.

During my college years I used to starve myself. I’d skip breakfast and dinner almost every day. My “meals” were just morning and evening coffee and a few bites of lunch shared by my friend that was what kept me going. I only had proper meals on weekends and even those weren’t really proper. I’d still try to cut them down.

I remember this one moment from my first year  a guy was telling his friend he was on a diet for some competition, saying he’d basically been starving for three days and felt weak. And I remember thinking to myself “I haven’t had a proper meal in a month… and I’m fine.”
I wasn’t fine. Not even close.

I kept this up for about two and a half years out of my four year degree. I was suffering a lot, both physically and mentally. The crazy part is that when I started starving myself I was already around 50 kg completely healthy for my height. But in my head I had to be under 40 kg to be “pretty.”

People would tell me things like “You look ghoulish,” “pale,” or “not even human.”
And I took those as compliments.

Looking back now I realize how twisted that was how much I hated myself without even realizing it. I was chasing an idea of beauty that was literally killing me.",12,1761505753.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.88,False

I (26f) am looking to make more friends. I'm currently trying to get out of a depressive funk and being around people gets me out of my head. 

A little bit about me: I don't live in Madison proper, but I am willing to drive wherever on the west or east sides or downtown (provided i can find reasonable parking). I love reading, listening to rock/metal/alt music and podcasts, binging random tv shows, DnD, knitting, embroidery, video games, cats, food, and finding new coffee shops. I have 2 cats that are absolute hooligans but I love them. 

Pros: I'm pretty much a go with the flow kind of person. I don't have any major reoccuring things besides an every other week dnd campaign and work, so as long as it's not 10 at night, I'm probably always down to hang out. 

Cons: I'm not great in large crowds, so most small bars where everyone is on top of each other is off the table. I am introverted so sometimes my social battery is nonexistent, but usually if I'm out and about, its not a big deal. I earn just below a liveable wage so expensive events/restaurants aren't really an option for me. I also have a hard time being around people who smoke/vape due to having bad asthma.

I've had a Sage Barista Express for a while now. Up until recently, I was using the single basket because I only want one cup of coffee. Online, I see almost everyone using the double basket as standard. I understand, after doing some research, that people do this because it's supposedly easier to pull a good espresso shot.

Now I have the double basket in. I have fresh beans and started at grind setting 12. My cup weighs 200 grams, and when there's coffee in it at setting 12, it weighs 260 grams. Ideally, that should be 236 grams, right?

I then set the grind setting to 6. Now my cup with contents weighs 240 grams. So that's already better.

Now I'm wondering a couple of things:

Am I doing this right? So, aiming for 36 grams of coffee. And then with an extraction time of approximately 25-30 seconds.

I see people doing it this way online. But I also see people manually pressing the button to stop the extraction around 25-30 seconds. So they don't let it stop automatically. How does that work?

Last question. I'm now using a double basket. But if I say I want 2 coffees, I'm essentially getting 4 espresso shots. I think that's quite a lot. If you want coffee in the morning, afternoon, and evening, you're quickly up to 8 ""cups of coffee."" What are your thoughts on this?

-i love to RP! have been for around 4 years now, can go up from just a few paragraphs to full novella! ties in with my love for writing and love to create characters and headcanons 
- i like to play video games a lot in my free time, like a lot a lot! some of the games i like to play with others are fortnite and roblox, and some that are single player that i love to play are fallout, Farcry, cyberpunk, terraria, borderlands, and minecraft as well! i play on a ps5, if you were wondering!

He just put down his fork, looked at me for maybe ten seconds, and said, ""Okay.""

That wasn't supposed to happen. I wanted him to fight for me. To beg. To tell me he'd change. Instead he asked if I needed help carrying boxes to my car.

We'd been married for eight years. Good years, honestly. He was stable, kind, always came home on time. But stable felt boring. My ex had been texting me for months, starting casual, then flirty. He remembered things about me my husband never seemed to notice anymore. Like how I used to love spontaneous road trips. How I hated my job. My husband just came home, ate dinner, asked about my day in that autopilot way, then watched TV.

My ex made me feel alive again. We met up for coffee twice. Then lunch. Then he kissed me in his car and I didn't stop him.

I convinced myself I deserved this. I was only thirty-two. I didn't want to spend the rest of my life feeling invisible.

So that night at dinner, I told my husband everything. About the texts. The meetings. The kiss. How my ex wanted me back and I was going.

He didn't yell. He didn't cry. He just nodded slowly and said, ""If that's what you want, I won't stop you.""

I actually got mad at him for not getting mad. I said, ""That's it? You're just giving up?""

He looked tired. ""I'm not giving up. You already did.""

I moved in with my ex the next day. My husband signed the divorce papers without a lawyer. Didn't ask for anything. Even let me keep furniture I wanted.

The first month with my ex was exciting. We went out constantly. He complimented me. Wanted me. It felt incredible.

Then I noticed things. He didn't have a job. He was between things, he said. I started paying for dates. Then groceries. Then his car payment because he was short that month.

He got annoyed when I worked late. Said I was choosing my job over him. Started arguments about stupid things. Accused me of flirting with a coworker when I mentioned a guy's name once.

Three months in, I found texts on his phone from two other women. Same things he'd said to me. Same lines about feeling alive.

When I confronted him, he shrugged. Said we weren't married, he could talk to whoever he wanted. Said maybe if I was more fun like I used to be, he wouldn't need to look elsewhere.

I left that night. Stayed with my sister. She didn't say I told you so, but I saw it in her face.

I tried texting my husband. Just to talk. He responded politely but briefly. He'd started seeing someone, he said. A woman from his gym. She made him happy.

I drove by our old house once. Saw her car in the driveway. Saw them through the window, cooking dinner together, laughing.

He looked lighter. Younger somehow. Like a weight had lifted.

That's when it hit me. He'd loved me. Really loved me. Came home every day, asked about my day because he actually cared, gave me stability because he wanted to build a life with me. And I threw it away because I wanted to feel like I did at twenty-two.

My ex made me feel desired. My husband made me feel loved. I was too stupid to know the difference.

I'm thirty-three now, living in a tiny apartment, working the same job I hated. My ex is probably texting some other bored wife. My husband is getting remarried next month.

My sister asked if I was going to try to win him back. I told her no. He deserves better than someone who only realized his worth after destroying him.

**So am I wrong for thinking I deserve a second chance, or should I accept that I ruined the best thing I ever had?**

After a couple weeks I decided I’d start tracking my weight, how I looked, and how I feel.  My scale is an older model Renpho and I’ve had it probably over five years, possibly more.  It showed I’m at 22.1% body fat, the same day I went and did a DEXA scan that put me at 30%.  The weight was within 0.2lbs.  How accurate are Renpho scales for the body fat measurement, older or newer models.  Is this a good way to track changes even if it is off by 8% to look for treads?

My second question, I did an RMR  test as well there, hadn’t eaten or had coffee in over 12 hours, and my RER showed that I was at 1.01.  Which she explained meant I was only burning calories, which meant I was strictly burning away muscle.  My diet is roughly a 1.2-1.2 grams per lean muscle, she said I need to go keto or very close to it or I’ll never actually lose fat, only muscle.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

A couple of lovely Mormon/LDS missionary gals stopped by my townhome recently. I invited them up and offered them a refreshing beverage - water, milk, juice, tea, coffee, soda. They both wanted a soda but told me as long as it was uncaffeinated. Apparently they have a lot of weird rules in their church, and abstaining from caffeine and hot beverages (wtf?) are two of them.

So I cracked open a couple of cans of Coke Zero and poured it into ice-filled glasses. I told them it was sugar and caffeine free, but tasted more like classic Coke than Diet Coke. They enjoyed their beverages and we had a lovely conversation for about a half hour. They asked if they could pray afterward, and I nodded. 

The whole time I was really wondering if Coke Zero really was caffeine free. It didn't matter much to me as an atheist but I did want to be respectful of their beliefs. Sure enough, Google tells me Coke Zero has the same amount of caffeine as regular Coke. 

Believe me when I tell you it was not a deliberate move on my part. I was mistaken. I actually asked a couple of other friends of mine who are former members of the Latter Day Saints church and they told me it's not a big deal. Then they told me about the Mormon practice of ""soaking"" for unmarried members who are courting each other, and their ""magic underwear"", and a bunch of other - in my opinion - fully bizarre practices and beliefs.

So me (18M) and this girl (18F) have been hanging out basically every day since college started around 2 months ago. We usually grab coffee in the evenings, then go for a walk and just talk for hours. She’s super comfortable with me — holds my arm, plays with my hair, side hugs, teases me, all that.

About 3 weeks after we met, I confessed to her. She said she didn’t like me that way and wanted to focus on herself and her studies right now. I said okay, and we just kept hanging out like before — every day, just the two of us.

A week later, she randomly asked why I liked her, and after I told her, she admitted she did like me too. Since then, we’ve gotten even closer, and she’s apologized a few times for rejecting me back then.

The thing is, even though she’s admitted she likes me, she still doesn’t want to be in a relationship. I don’t wanna rush her, but I also don’t wanna end up being the guy who’s just “almost” something to her.

I even told her recently that I kinda regret confessing because it made things weird, and she said that’s why she told me she liked me — so I wouldn’t feel too regretful.

Now I’m just confused. She clearly likes me, but doesn’t want to date. Do I wait and see where it goes, or start emotionally checking out before I get stuck?

My dad is a fisherman and whenever he goes out fishing, I personally enjoy the time without him, because he makes us and our poor mom do every single chore, and sometimes, make him coffee or a mix of soda/cranberry juice and vodka, whenever we miss a chore or make a coffee or drink wrong, instead of telling us kindly and asking us to resume said chore, he yells at us these words ""Didn't I tell you kids to get this (enter room name here) cleaned up? For the (exaggerated number here) time!"" He also favouratizes our younger dog over us, the dogs name is Echo, she is a great Pyrenees, and she is turning 3 or 4 this year, our dad makes us bake cookies, bread, and other foods, and feeds some to the dog, earlier he yelled at my younger brother for wanting to put chocolate in the cookies he wanted us to bake, and our dad yelled ""(younger brothers name here), your attitude for the dog needs to stop!, if you don't, your grounded for 6 months!"" The reason why my younger brother wanted to put chocolate in the cookies was because he hates baking for people, just for 40% of it to be given to the dog, just like most of us, another thing he does is that he favouratizes my 2nd oldest brother over the rest of us, because he goes fishing aswell, he seems to favouratize us based off of if we have the same interests as him, so, my 2nd oldest brother likes fishing, so he gets favouratized because he likes fishing, my younger brother like military, so, he gets favouratized for liking military, but less, I like dinosaurs, The only thing I am favouratized for is when dad wants a chore done

Here is one of the use case.

  
**Context / requirements**

* Example behavior to handle:
   * User A: rule → merchant == ""Ananda Bhavan"" → category = **Food**
   * User B: rule → merchant == ""Ananda Bhavan"" → category = **Restaurant**
   * User C: rule → merchant == ""Ananda Bhavan"" → category = **Snacks**
   * User D: rule → merchant == ""Ananda Bhavan"" → category = **Coffee Shop**
   * New User E: has custom category **Eating Out**; when E uploads a transaction with merchant ""Ananda Bhavan"", the system should map that merchant to E’s **Eating Out** category.
* Goals:
   1. Learn that “Ananda Bhavan” is a restaurant that serves food, snacks and coffee from aggregated signals across users.
   2. Respect each user’s custom categories and rules — perform personalized mapping when possible.
   3. Provide a robust default classification for first-time users while minimizing misclassification.

He rementions that the Experimental (Beta) Branch is again live for 1.1. to test this change that was released in [Patch 1.1.1.5](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Patch_1.1.1.5) (Wiki Link). The removal of the distant spline hitboxes for Conveyors, Pipelines and Hypertubes, has seen a marked improvement in game performance and reduction in memory used.

   * **Spline hitboxes for Railways are NOT removed** as doing so would cause train signals to not function properly and result in train crashes. However, Mikael did mention they are looking in improving train performance and logistics in the future.

   * The removal of the spline hitboxes has no affect or change in the number of Unreal Engine UObjects.

* [Q&A: Do you have a follow-up for a Roadmap from last week's stream?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRcYO_-MJM) - ANSWER: This is in reference to [this question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELBLXHedaZY) from last week. Other than the Console Release, and Version 1.2, other than that, they do have a clear vision of where the game is going and when they are ready they will share that.

   * [Q&A: Arced Walls, maybe?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szpooFPGXY8&t=32s) - ANSWER: *(Same answer as above)*

* [Q&A: Will we get to see any official way to handle Z-fighting on odd shapes in 1.2?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR3DfXn2jV0) - ANSWER: While Version 1.2 might squash an odd bug related to z-fighting, but as for properly handling it, they have no plans on doing that.

* [Q&A: Would there be any chance of Roads being buildable the same way as Railways or Conveyors?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IRhRAGrtZw) - ANSWER: There are no current plans. Being able to layout ""roads"" easily takes away from some of the core game mechanics.

* [Q&A: Whatever happened to the games from the Game Jam 2024?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUeQdhz8I50) - ANSWER: There release is *very low priority* as many of the games are not fully releasable as 4 out of 5 are not credited properly, along other possible issues.

I couldn't help. And my husband kept dismising him and told him he is busy and to go away and then called me to come and take him, while muting and unmuting his mic. Our son got frustrated too, started crying and in the end he spanked him so bad that my child fell to the floor. And then he ran to me crying and I talked to him and said dad didn't want to, but I will talk to him and he said its not the first time. And cried harder.

this is the original post (from my other account I cannot access)

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married within a year.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me very hard for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway.",1,1761504449.0,Marriage,7,0.67,False

—Have them directly call the allergist and ask for a quicker appointment

—Have my primary order blood allergy tests for the top food allergies

I see you all months or years into this and I’m wondering if you know anything else I should request.

The hives are just getting worse even on prednisone. I’m afraid I’m going to end up at the ER. Im not sure what exactly I’m allergic too. I got the hives to chill out quite a bit for 4 days while I only ate a handful of things, although I still had some hives. I was drinking coffee with creamer, but then I ate cheese at dinner and immediately felt flushed, and within 45 had hives all over my body. Woke up the next day with the swollen lips. I’ve avoided all dairy since Friday night but the hives are still bad. I donno if it’s from the one exposure or that was just coincidence. 

I’m just desperate and in so much pain. I cried while wearing jeans in the grocery store. I’ve never had hives before. I’ve had food sensitivities before but not like this. This all started on the 22nd of September. ",1,1761504335.0,FoodAllergies,3,1.0,False

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Safe to say it’s been… an experience. Every profile feels like déjà vu, the same clichés on repeat.

**Here are the greatest hits:**

1. A story about almost getting arrested abroad (Barcelona, Ibiza, Prague - bonus points if it involves “skinny dipping” or “stealing a street sign”).
2. Generic hobbies: “traveling, food, long walks, wine” - wow, you and literally every human being alive.
3. Scheduling a date that feels like booking a meeting with your manager. *“How does 3 weeks from Thursday look for a quick 30-minute coffee slot?”*
4. A proud declaration that you’re a “plant mom,” immediately followed by “lol I kill every plant I touch.” (Congrats, you’ve mastered the art of buying ferns just to commit slow botanical murder.)
5. Something about being “fluent in sarcasm” like it’s a rare skill.
6. A claim that you’re “so bad at texting” even though your screen time is 9 hours a day.

So let’s skip all that.

About me: I’m in London, I work in finance, and yes, I travel (though I’ve never been “detained in Spain,” so maybe I’m missing out). I’m more into finding the best dim sum spot in Chinatown, a strong negroni, or a last minute trip abroad.

What I’m looking for: something light, casual, fun. Not a serious relationship right now. Just meeting people who don’t treat dating like an admin task, enjoying a laugh, and seeing where it goes without the pressure.

**Things I appreciate:**

* A conversation that lasts more than 4 texts.
* Someone who can enjoy both a ballet at the Royal Opera House and a late-night kebab on the way home.
* A partner who doesn’t think “traveling” is a personality, but still has a valid passport.
* A sense of humour about how ridiculous dating apps have become.
* Binge watching reality tv and gossiping about the drama.
* Meeting IRL - London based only.

This is my first ever attempt at writing. I’m a huge horror fan and felt very inspired to make this and I’m looking for any feedback. This is part 1 of a 6 part series and the first 4 are available on Reddit and Wattpad. If you’re interested in more, let me know! Thank you for your time!!

Part 1


If you're reading this, it's because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It's only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it's hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We're barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it's already a ghost town. That's where this all began — a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

""Spectre's: Records & Rarities""; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn't be able to name a single song off the album they're donning. It really was a place frozen in time — the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game — finding an album I'd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I'm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight's choice: ""Secret Treaties"" by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" — who doesn't? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. I retired the familiar sounds of ELO off the turntable and introduced it to something new. 

Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70's. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ""Career of Evil"" blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn't have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ""Harvester of Eyes"" certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn't care anyway — he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn't have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn't nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody's grave. That was the reality of this place — four months out of the year, it's so full of life that it's overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that's why I never left. If I don't visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting — this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him — which was two blocks away — there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn't want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent's Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

""Oh my god! You scared me!"" she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ""I'm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.""

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

""Sure, sure. Three bucks.""

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ""So, any plans tonight?""

I thought about it, and I really didn't have any. I knew my ritual at this point — work and then visit Mick's for a drink or two until I've had enough to put me to sleep.

""I was going to head over to Mick's, maybe catch the game for a bit.""

She grinned. ""I know Mick's — right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I'll stop by. There isn't much else to do on a night like tonight.""

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

""Maybe I'll see you there,"" I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice — might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

""Hey bud, I haven't seen you in a while.""

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ""Hey Mac, long time.""

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ""It's been dead out here, huh?""

Without looking up, he lamented, ""Sure has. It's that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.""

Puzzled, I pressed him. ""What do you mean?""

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ""I need to get some help. I'm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.""

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn't have been happier.

""That's great, man! I'd give you a ride myself if I had a car.""

I chuckled — that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ""I just need to see her again.""

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

""I haven't really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and... everything just started falling apart..."" he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ""I'm just ready. Tonight's my last night — I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.""

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn't know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ""Vincent's was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I'll see you, I won't take no for an answer.""

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

""That's really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.""

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ""I really think what you're doing is great. It's been nice knowing you.""

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ""You too. I'd say I'll see you again, but I really hope it's not here.""

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

""Hey, what's your real name, by the way? Maybe I'll look you up someday to see how you're doing.""

Without turning fully around, he said, ""It doesn't really matter.""

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick's resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk — the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick's served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick's was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig — Mick's was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it — when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp's nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn't a wasp's nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving — rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was... breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn't very big — maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn't help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

They blinked at me.

**I've been getting some lovely messages from international ace's.  As I'm looking for something IRL please kindly only reply/DM if you're in the UK thank you.**

I seem to be one of the older folks around here, but thought I'd give this a try.  As the title says I'm 41 from the UK and would love to find a partner to enjoy life with.  In terms of my aceishness (not a word, but I'm running with it), I'm sex indifferent, but also consider myself kink positive, but I think that's a more private conversation for down the line.  On the flip side I can consider myself to be extremely romantic and love a good cuddle.

I work in tech (like every other Redditor it seems) and that keeps me very busy, but I find myself really lonely in my spare time, hence this post.  In terms of hobbies and interests I'm a huge lover of cinema, bit of a foodie, big reader (big interest in psychology) and I love my sci-fi, oh and coffee is my main vice.  I like to get out in nature especially if there's a cosy pub at the end of the hike.

What else?  I love animals especially dogs but don't have one at the moment unfortunately, I've dealt with my fair share of challenges in my life, but like to think that I've generally remained a positive person i.e. I've become a better more considered person despite said challenges.  

Feel free to say hello, while ultimately I'm looking for a partner I don't consider new friends a consolation prize.

1ogs8y4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenDogTraining/comments/1ogs8y4/rebuilding_relationship_between_two_dogs/,Rebuilding relationship between two dogs,"Based in UK if helpful.

My 4 year old spayed female dog (rescue hound mix) has recently started to growl at my father in law’s 9 year old intact male dog (border terrier) when he stays with us when they are on holiday (They aren’t able to put him in kennels due to various reasons and we have always been happy to care for him at a few points throughout the year and they often reciprocate and look after our dog too).

It began earlier this year when she started resource guarding her toys against him, plus she tries and steal all his toys too, even though she doesn’t play with them and just lies on top of them, so to manage this we have taken all toys away when he visits. She has also occasionally growled when he walks past the coffee table that she likes to sit underneath, so again we have removed this when he visits. She has never growled while he interacts with us but she often tries to push in between like she is jealous.

However my father in law’s dog is very submissive to her, he doesn’t actively try and take her toys at all or take his back. He isn’t a rude sniffer or otherwise pushy in his interactions with her, he’s mostly interested in getting attention from us. When she growls he backs off and avoids her and even refuses to come into the room she is in sometimes. When she stares at him he turns his face away from her. On the whole he is happy to leave her alone but she can growl and overreact even when he walks past her doing nothing.

From my understanding she doesn’t really display these behaviours when staying at my father in law’s house (although I can’t be 100% sure and they could be missing the signs) and they are fine outside and when walking together. It seems to be a problem of resource guarding within our house.

The dogs used to get on really well, our female was a rescue we got 3 years ago and was really timid when we got her and my father in law’s dog really helped her get out her shell and gave her confidences They used to play bitey face games a fair bit but that’s basically stopped now. On the rare occasion my dog tries to initiate play with him she really struggles to get him to interact as he basically wants nothing to do with her now!

My dog’s behaviour is now making it really difficult to look after my father in law’s dog as I’m always on tenterhooks that my dog is going to snap at him or that one day he won’t back down and they’ll fight. They have always eaten meals separately and slept separately but I’m worried now to even leave the room. I’m also due to have my first baby and really concerned about how that might affect the situation as I’ll have even less time to manage them in the future and won’t be able to focus on them as much.

I really want to try and repair their relationship and encourage my dog to see my father in law’s dog visiting as a positive thing, but I have no idea where to start and don’t want to make it worse.

I would be incredibly grateful for any advice on what to do. I am also likely going to consult a local trainer but wanted to see if there was any helpful thoughts from this sub first.

1ogs0x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypoglycemia/comments/1ogs0x3/any_suggestions/,Any Suggestions?,"Hello all,

Long story short, I (30F) have hypoglycemia, have had it for at least 20 years. Parents were not the 'going to the doctor' type and just let me eat more often to accommodate some of the symptoms.

I have seen my pcp, who sent me to an Endo. Endo stated that it's not diabetes so manage with diet and sent me to a dietician. Dietician said I'm eating exactly as I should aside from not having protein as soon as I wake up in the morning. I have GERD and have a hard time eating actual food first thing in the morning, so we compromised at having a protein shake in my coffee once I get to work.

My lows happen inconsistently randomly throughout the day and overnight; I barely ever go higher than 140. I currently manage with a Lingo cgm but the out of pocket is getting a bit ridiculous.

Yes, I have a finger monitor. Yes, it is fairly accurate to what the cgm shows. I have two T2D in the family so the general knowledge of all thing's diabetic is familiar.

I had a 2 hr. GTT done in January of 2025. fasting glucose was 85 (i had a huge late-night dinner the night before-pasta and ice cream), end of 2 hr. result was 70. After the lab was drawn, I barely made it back to the parking lot where I had my Hypo snack pack at. I had dropped significantly after the 2hr mark, hitting a low of 48 (verified on CGM and fingerstick) before I got it high enough that I could drive home and have a meal. I explained what happened to the endo who stated that the lab showed I was ""not diabetic"" and ""normal"". He refused to write a RX for a monitor; stating that with a diet change I should be fine (despite the dietitian saying I was eating correctly). I really don't love the Lingo purely bc it doesn't have alarms (I get that it can't bc it's an OTC) and that it only measures to 55 then states LO.

I'm frustrated with the healthcare system (I work for it) and the fact that I have to beg my providers for any kind of testing. For example, the dr offices aren't willing to submit any paperwork in order to justify a CGM without having a diabetes diagnosis. I carry TWO decent, nearly full coverage insurances. I verified with both that there is coverage available if the provider will fill out specific forms justifying the CGM (i.e. had months' worth of finger sticks listed out, multiple times a day- before/after meals and whenever symptoms hit).

Anyone with advice? There are no other providers available within my insurance network, and even though they are all within the same office, I have to wait 6-9 months for an appointment.",1,1761503302.0,Hypoglycemia,0,1.0,False

I recently started using the Paidwork app, and it's been a solid option for earning a bit of extra cash in my free time.

What's unique about Paidwork is that it combines several methods in one place. You can earn by completing small tasks, participating in surveys, testing apps, and even playing games. It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it's legitimate and the low payout threshold means you can actually get your money without waiting forever.

The app is free to use, which is perfect for a student budget. If you're interested in checking it out, you can use my referral link to sign up: [Insert Your Referral Link Here]. Using a referral can sometimes give you a starting bonus.

Recently I’ve been more and more interested in TM, I learned a few years ago but I wasn’t consistent. Last year my wife asked me for a solution for her overthinking and stress. She learned TM and I got engaged having and expressing astonishing results. But muy wife just lost interest and it’s very difficult to watch her so in her head all day doing stuff without purpose and still trying to meditate and maintaining a calm atmosphere in the house. I am loosing the motivation. I feel stupid putting the effort to take the time to do the asanas and the Tm. I’ll rather just wake up and take the coffee and whatever. I know it’s childish and silly. 
We went to a tm retreat and my wife told everyone that she was meditating regularly and then she told me that she liked the retreat but after coming home she just don’t take the time . She tells me that sometimes she does one in the evening but I still see the difference in her way of acting and it is as we lived in two different worlds.

The date was nice and we were chatting and having fun plus we had texted back-and-forth a fair amount the week before we met. 

The weird thing that happened was that somewhere towards the end of the date he looked at me and he said I almost grabbed you and kissed you in the fiction section of the bookstore and I was kind of surprised and I laughed and said, oh you mean without asking me? and he said “well I thought about it and I decided not to, but I was going to do this” and then he grabbed my jacket and pulled me pretty hard towards him like halfway and then let go and I was really surprised and said something like like “why would you do that?” And then he said “oh I decided not to, but I thought it would make a really good story in the future”. 

This made me really uncomfortable at the moment, but I kind of brushed it off and laughed about it at the time (wish I had handled it differently but the fawn response kicked in pretty strong). Looking back, it feels so strange that somebody would do or say any of that on a first date, and we had also talked about the fact that my ex had been abusive in a way that made me feel physically unsafe so for me that was just doubly strange. As I’m reflecting on this, it makes me more and more uncomfortable, but I’m trying to figure out if I’m overreacting or not. What do folks think?",3,1761503070.0,TwoXChromosomes,2,0.71,False

I (f23) broke up with my boyfriend (m29) of three years, and now I’m having serious doubts about whether it was the right thing to do.

A bit of context: my boyfriend and I are very different in some major ways. He likes staying up late, while I prefer getting up early. I enjoy being spontaneous — like going out for a coffee on a Thursday night — but he prefers his routines and rarely strays from them. He likes spending time alone, whereas I’d love to bring him along to family gatherings or hang out with friends together.
These differences never really bothered me until a few months ago, when I was traveling more for work and started realizing how much I miss spontaneity.

We talked a lot about how we could change things — like me staying up later so we could do something together, or setting up a monthly “date day” where we’d make time for each other, maybe cook or go out. But unfortunately, those ideas never actually turned into action.

And now come the doubts. I love him — he’s incredibly supportive, we share the same sense of humor, and he has such a kind and gentle soul.

But I don’t know if that would have been enough in the long run, especially thinking about my future. Writing that down feels so selfish though.
