When the shop opens, I'll be managing their coffee training and education, so I'd like to find a machine that best complements my training style. 

I don't want a machine that stops shots automatically ‚Äî or I at least need that to be an optional feature. I plan on training the baristas to understand the visuals of espresso extraction (e.g. flow rate and color changes) so they can stop their own shots. I understand that some machines are programmed to stop shots at a set output weight or volume, and I don't want to be restricted with output in that way. I've worked at shops that rely too heavily on maintaining a certain brew ratio and I think that can, at a point, discourage coffee as an art form. I think what I'm getting at is this: if this is the main selling point for a machine, I want to be steered against it. 

I've also questioned the necessity of independent boilers for each group (to set different temperatures), but I'm still unsure. We'll have a primary espresso blend as well as a rotating single origin and decaf espresso, but it seems like setting each group at a different temperature would restrict what espresso can be used on either side? I don't want to be stuck with a group that's programmed for decaf or single origin only, for example, as that'll limit efficiency. Maybe I'm not understanding the benefits of this feature?

Currently, the top contenders are the linea pb (or pb x), the kb90, and the strada (i wouldn't know which strada because there are too many versions). I don't like how the linea classic looks, but I wouldn't be opposed to any other recommendations. Thank you!",1,1742840018.0,LaMarzocco,0,1.0,False

We predominantly use ground coffee from the store but, from time to time, I‚Äôve bought beans and ground them at home. My cheap coffee grinder has since been taken over for other uses (spice grinding for savory dishes), so my search for another grinder led me to this!

Both my wife and I prefer milk-based drinks and we do use non-dairy milks at times, although I do enjoy a cortado and flat white from coffee shops more often than I order a macchiato (and yes, I‚Äôm aware the Sbux cortado is not an authentic cortado). I‚Äôm leaning towards the Breville Barista Touch Impress, although I could live with the Barista Touch. 

I‚Äôm scared to spend the amounts even for those just because (1) there are multiple points of failure that I might not be able to handle and (2) I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to lose interest in this, so I do have a work anniversary gift I can redeem for, among other things, a Delonghi Stilosa or another one that was off-brand (but around the same price as the Stilosa), which will allow me to get used to the flow of espresso-making without spending more than I‚Äôd like. However, the drawbacks there are a lot more manual adjustments and temp surf that can happen with the Stilosa, which might deter and discourage me from continuing to use it and pursue the hobby altogether.

1jixfr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1jixfr3/an_84_hour_buttermilk_fast_a_journey_through_body/,An 84 hour buttermilk fast: A journey through body and mind,"
Fasting has always intrigued me. It is a practice that has existed across cultures, not just for spiritual reasons but also for its profound effects on the body and mind. This time, I embarked on a buttermilk-only fast for 84 hours, consuming nothing but buttermilk, water, and minimal salt and spices.

Why Buttermilk? The Choice of a Functional Fast

When choosing a fasting method, I wanted a balance between nourishment and detoxification. Plain water fasting seemed too extreme, while juice fasting carried the risk of blood sugar spikes. Buttermilk, however, was the perfect choice for the following reasons:

1.	Electrolyte Balance ‚Äì Buttermilk naturally contains potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium, preventing dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

2.	Probiotic Benefits ‚Äì Fermented buttermilk is rich in beneficial bacteria, which aid digestion and help the gut microbiome.

3.	Satiety Without Overloading ‚Äì The mild fat and protein content in buttermilk provides sustained energy without overwhelming the digestive system.

4.	Cooling and Anti-Inflammatory Properties ‚Äì Unlike coffee or heavy dairy products, buttermilk is light on digestion and has a cooling effect on the body, reducing inflammation.

With this plan in mind, I had my last solid food on 20th March 2025‚Äîunfortunately a half-piece of KitKat Chocolate üç´ ‚Äîand thus began my journey.

‚∏ª

The Stages of Fasting and My Body‚Äôs Responses

Phase 1: The First 24 Hours (Glycogen Depletion and Hunger Control)

‚Ä¢	Glycogen Stores Used: My body first burned through stored glucose (glycogen) for energy.

‚Ä¢	Hunger and Cravings: By 17 hours in, I felt intense cravings for savory foods like Aloo Jeera‚Äîa dish I don‚Äôt usually prefer.

‚Ä¢	Urination and Bowel Movements: The gut responded quickly. I had four urinations and passed a stool that had a greenish tinge, indicating early detox.

‚Ä¢	Relief from Buttermilk: At 15:03, I had 820 ml buttermilk. It provided a sense of relief, though cravings persisted.

Phase 2: 24-48 Hours (Fat Adaptation & Ketosis Begins)

‚Ä¢	Shift to Fat Metabolism: As glycogen reserves depleted, my body switched to burning stored fat for energy.

‚Ä¢	Hunger Waves Intensified: Around 23:01, I had an unexpected craving for my favourite Chole Bhature‚Äîsomething I rarely eat.

‚Ä¢	Mental Strength & Craving Control: I reminded myself‚Äîkeep busy, stay active. At 21:28, I noticed salivation had reduced, which helped in controlling urges.

‚Ä¢	Unexpected Fresh Breath: By the second morning, I woke up with an odd yet pleasant freshness in my breath, a result of ketone metabolism.

Phase 3: 48-72 Hours (Deep Cellular Repair & Autophagy)

‚Ä¢	Peak Fat-Burning Mode: By 60 hours, I had lost 4.5 kg, as my body had fully shifted to fat metabolism.

‚Ä¢	Reduced Inflammation & Digestive Reset: My stomach felt lighter, with less bloating.

‚Ä¢	Toughest Mental Battle (44-46 Hours): The most difficult hours were between 44-46 hours. Hunger was mentally exhausting, but once I crossed it, cravings significantly reduced.

‚Ä¢	Buttermilk‚Äôs Role in Recovery: Drinking 450ml buttermilk with cumin and salt at 19:57 on 22nd March immediately calmed my system and eased hunger.

‚Ä¢	Kechari Mudra Helped: Practicing this yogic tongue posture reduced cravings and improved mental focus.

Phase 4: 72-84 Hours (Peak Cellular Healing & Refeeding Preparation)

‚Ä¢	Maximum Cellular Repair: By 84 hours, my body had entered deep autophagy, breaking down damaged cells and recycling them for repair.

‚Ä¢	Minimal Bloating & Stable Energy: Unlike carb-heavy diets, this fasting method ensured that I felt light and energetic, not sluggish.

‚Ä¢	Mind Over Matter: Hunger was no longer urgent, but I still had cravings‚Äîespecially for chocolate cake (thanks to my wife mentioning it!).

‚∏ª

Breaking the Fast: The Most Crucial Step

The first post-fast meal determines whether the experience is beneficial or harmful. I carefully planned my refeeding, starting with:

1.	Three Tulsi Leaves ‚Äì Helped prepare my stomach.

2.	Super thin Moong Dal Soup & Overcooked Kala Namak Rice ‚Äì Soft, easy-to-digest food with minimal spices.

3.	Roasted Cumin & Pink Salt ‚Äì Light seasoning to support digestion.

Immediate Observations:

‚Ä¢	The first bite felt overwhelmingly filling, a sign of stomach shrinkage.

‚Ä¢	A burp immediately followed, indicating satiety and digestion activation.

‚Ä¢	Mild stomach burning occurred but subsided with water.

‚Ä¢	Throughout the day, hunger remained low, but cravings lingered (notably for samosa and chocolate pastry!).

‚∏ª

Key Benefits Achieved from the Buttermilk Fast

1. Fat Loss Without Muscle Wasting
	‚Ä¢	Total weight loss: 5 kg over 84 hours.
	‚Ä¢	Since buttermilk provided some protein and fats, muscle loss was minimal, unlike in water fasting.

2. Improved Mental Clarity & Willpower
	‚Ä¢	Mental focus improved by the third day.
	‚Ä¢	Reduced anxiety and better self-control over cravings.

3. Gut Healing & Detoxification
	‚Ä¢	Greenish stools indicated bile release and liver detox.
	‚Ä¢	Fewer digestive issues and less bloating post-fast.
	‚Ä¢	More efficient digestion after breaking the fast.

4. Reduced Inflammation & Joint Stiffness
	‚Ä¢	Less body stiffness, likely due to lower carbohydrate intake and improved circulation.

5. Cellular Repair & Autophagy
	‚Ä¢	By 72 hours, my body had activated deep autophagy, where old or damaged cells were broken down and replaced with healthier cells.
	‚Ä¢	This process is linked to anti-aging and longevity.

‚∏ª

Scientific Explanation Behind the Benefits

1. Autophagy & Cellular Regeneration

Autophagy is a natural process where the body removes damaged cells and proteins, improving longevity, immune function, and cellular repair. Studies show that fasting beyond 24 hours can significantly increase autophagy, leading to better metabolic health.

2. Fat Adaptation & Ketosis

By 48 hours, my body shifted to ketosis, burning stored fat for fuel instead of glucose. This helps in:
	‚Ä¢	Rapid fat loss
	‚Ä¢	Better metabolic flexibility
	‚Ä¢	Improved cognitive function

3. Probiotic & Digestive Health from Buttermilk

Unlike water fasting, buttermilk fasting maintains gut flora, thanks to probiotics. This prevents post-fast bloating and supports a smooth transition back to regular eating.

‚∏ª

Final Thoughts: Would I Do It Again?

Yes, but with proper hydration and mindfulness. The fast taught me discipline, self-awareness, and the true nature of hunger. Buttermilk proved to be the perfect balance between fasting and nourishment, ensuring that my gut health, electrolytes, and energy levels remained stable.

This experience wasn‚Äôt just about losing weight‚Äîit was about resetting the body and mind. If done with awareness, fasting can be a powerful tool for health, clarity, and self-discovery.",2,1742839762.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

I think many can relate but it hasn't been easy and I've had days where I have just cried, days I have wanted to pull my hair out, days where I really thought that maybe I couldn't turn this boat around, days where I was even stressing that my last resort was BE.

Now I sit here watching him stretch his little toe beans out just snoozing after having a fantastic walk with him and I can't believe I thought that I would have to BE him a few months ago. Don't get me wrong I'm sure we will still have our downs at some point but he really has come such a long way in a year and I am so proud of him.

Prozac has been a game changer for us. Mace is a great dog 99% of the time but the other 1% was always very quick to react if he didn't like something with little to no warning which was our main issue and the reason I started going down the road of possibly BE if things didn't get better. My husband had lost confidence and trust in him and I was starting to worry that we couldn't fix this.

However, 3 months later and he's doing so well and he and my husband's relationship has gotten so so much better! My husband has confidence with him again and has built back up some trust and mace also seems much happier and comfortable. Mace has started growling when he dislikes things rather than just straight up reacting. I never thought I'd say this but im so happy my dog is now growling and I looked like a crazy woman in the coffee shop telling my dog hes such a good boy and throwing cheese at him after a lady decided to crouch in his face without asking and he growled rather than hit her in the face with his muzzle üíÄ

His dog reactivity has also gotten soooooo much better. All our recent walks we have come across dogs and he hasn't lunged or barked at any of them and he's stopped locking on. The engage and disengage game has been such a life changer for us. Just today we had 2 chihuahuas lunging and barking at mace (this was a whole annoying thing in itself watching an owner just set their dogs up to react) and he just looked at them but turned and came back to me for some cheese. Before December he would have been lunging and barking at them and very difficult to move away.

Overall I'm just celebrating our wins right now and I'm really proud of how far we have come. If you are in a similar boat to us please know there is light at the end of the tunnel. Just keep going and be consistent and know that it's okay to use medication to help your dog. There is nothing wrong with using it if your dog needs it and can benefit from it.

For context, my fianc√© and I make pretty much the same each pay check. Sometimes he gets incentive pay for good performance. My fianc√© has a lot of credit card debit from cards he opened in college, so per month, most of his pay check goes to pay down the interest of those cards. He doesn‚Äôt like to talk about it with me because he is embarrassed, which is a whole other conversation.

I have little payments on my one credit card that I am trying to be better about paying off per month and have started making low payments on student loans (less than $100). He has student loan payments from undergrad and graduate school that keep getting differed by what is going on with the department but when they begin, they will most likely be high. So I understand he is stressed.

I consistently put a little more than half my paycheck into our utilities account, while he somehow always has a reason to contribute less than half. We are a month and a half ahead on rent, so at the moment I am not worried. But recently he asked two separate times to take money out for two different wants, not needs. One was a wedding gift of $100 (understandable, we knew about this wedding for months) and another was to buy something that we don‚Äôt need really. But eventually if he keeps contributing like this then most of the money in the account will be my contributions.

He always wants to eat fast food each week, go out to drink, buy things, or get a coffee when we run errands. I try to cook at home as much as we can to save money and make coffee at home. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to go out or have fun dates, it‚Äôs just that I want to try to save money for the future and be able to buy myself clothes/makeup.

Recently, in the last year and a half, I have become a bit more frustrated with my fianc√©‚Äôs spending habits. When we go out, it falls on me to pay for things unless it is payday then he does all out on that one day. Like on this past Valentine‚Äôs Day, he said he wanted to go half at a really nice restaurant so we could afford it. That was fine with me, so I pay with my card and he says he‚Äôll Apple Pay me. Come payday he never pays me and asked to pay less on rent.

He often tells me to spoil myself more, but when I tell him I can‚Äôt afford to do that, he asks where all my money goes. So I‚Äôd stay quiet and frustrated. What is also most frustrating is that he always has money for his vices, yet I am picking up the tab everywhere, even in front of his friends.

His mother is planning on moving in with us in the next few months, so I have been feeling a lot of pressure that he will not change but find more excuses for why he doesn‚Äôt pay for anything. And it will be myself and his mother paying for things.

I truly do love him. It‚Äôs just becoming more frustrating especially when this has been a topic of discussion with no evident improvement and he doesn‚Äôt want to really discuss it.

For reference I am from and living in Northern Europe. I was really hesitant so I didn‚Äôt give him my number but took his. After looking him up and verifying what he told me, I messaged him. We start texting and he was messaging me everyday. I am in university so it was difficult to message him all the time when he was texting me. We continued and he constantly asked when I would be available for a date. I wasn‚Äôt available during the weekdays as I have school. 
Also, Ramadan is talking place at the moment so he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to eat during the daytime if we met, but he still seemed keen to meet me. 
Eventually, we arrange a date for Sunday (yesterday) for a walk and coffee.

We also talked about ourselves while on the phone, he asked about previous relationships and I answered and asked him too. He told me his previous relationship was 6 months ago and it was 1 year long. He also asked me specifically ifI am a jealous person in relationships. I said no. 
I asked why did he ask that and he said his last girlfriend was very very jealous so he doesn‚Äôt like that. 
I concluded then that he must not be jealous or anything like that‚Ä¶
We made the plans for 7pm but I ended up being delayed at my house so we didn‚Äôt meet until 8.( I kept him updated and apologised profusely for all this, he said it was no problem. )
Also, I didn‚Äôt have him pick me up from my house as I didn‚Äôt know who this man was, I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal and it was my first time having a fate with him. 

We had dinner, it was fine, talked about ourselves, our family, school, work. General things. I told him I lived in my family house. He asked questions about my family and school. 
I also had told him about myself when we spoke on the phone. 
He was friendly and paid for dinner and seemed happy about the meal. 
He dropped me back where he collected me. 
I told him I would confirm the time for the date on Sunday with him as we hadn‚Äôt figured out the exact time. 


Yesterday (Sunday) he texted asking about what time suited. 
I said I was going to be delayed by the same problem as yesterday so It would be later than expected. 

I met him at the same place as Saturday. We got in the car and he drove me down the road and had little chit chat. I also apologised again for the unexpected problems.  

He then pulled over, at the start of this convo he asked my age and I asked his to clarify things, I‚Äôm 21 and he‚Äôs 28. I thought he might be younger and he thought I was a bit older. He asked me more  about my family and if he could see a picture of them. I said ok. I don‚Äôt really have any photos of my whole family on my phone, other then photos from weddings, individual photos, photos with each sibling etc. 
I explained that to him and showed him some photos that I did have. 
I was also hesitant to show him photos as I don‚Äôt know this man. 

He went on to say how he was uncomfortable moving forward and is suspicious and feels like I‚Äôm lying to him. 

I was gobsmacked and felt like it came out of nowhere as this was only the second time we had spoken in person.

I was so confused and asked why he was suspicious, he said I should have more photos of my family on my phone and he wants to see them, he also said that he didn‚Äôt think I lived where I said I lived. I explained I did but I didn‚Äôt want him to come to my house because I don‚Äôt know him well yet. I am very honest so I was shocked where this was coming from. He insinuated that I didn‚Äôt really live with my parents and I was lying about that. 
I ended up showing him my id for proof of address, lots of photos of my parents, my family, my pets my friends. I showed him a photo I took of my brother with our dog TAKEN THE NIGHT BEFORE. 
He said he still didn‚Äôt believe me. 

I was so confused. 
He then went on about how I‚Äôm definitely hiding something because I am so shocked and seem to be trying to ‚Äòprove something‚Äô. üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´
This was all in his car after he had pulled over. We were meant to get a drink and a nice walk. 
I then reasoned with him that I believed his story yet I hadn‚Äôt any proof, he has seen more proof of me and my life than I had him yet he still didn‚Äôt believe me for some reason. I would have never even asked to see his family, I just believed him. 
I asked why he though I would lie about that? And he didn‚Äôt have an answer. I asked if he had any trust issues or feels like he‚Äôs ready for a relationship and he said he felt what he is saying is justified and needs to express it. 
The more I tried to convince him, the less he seemed to believe. ..
I felt like I was being interrogated the whole time. 
I couldn‚Äôt believe it and then said ‚Äò oh well would you show me your family? You haven‚Äôt shown me anything yet but I am meant to trust you‚Äô he then said he wouldn‚Äôt be showing me because he didn‚Äôt trust me. 
He drove me back to where he dropped me before, I stayed in the car and he let me know he would think about things but might not want to see me again. I ended up showing this man, my family, my id for PROOF OF ADDRESS, my university app to show him I actually was a student, and he still seemed unsure. I was so confused. I asked if this was made up and maybe there was another reason he wouldn‚Äôt want to see me again? Maybe I‚Äôm not attractive to him? He said no, he found me absolutely gorgeous. HE THEN TRIED TO GET ME TO KISS HIM. It was very weird. Like why would you want to kiss me if you think I‚Äôm lying to you? When I expressed even more confusion for him trying to kiss me after him being so adamantly dissatisfied with me, he told me it is normal, as if we were in a relationship together and had a disagreement, he would be direct like this, clarify things and then want to kiss me. We hadn‚Äôt clarified anything as he still wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the proof I showed him and was getting ready to leave his car.He  then also talked to me about sex and how attractive he found me, I was surprised by this as I was aware he was fasting for Ramadan at the same moment. He asked if I was attracted to him as I didn‚Äôt seem to express that. I reassured him and told him again I wouldn‚Äôt have gone out with him if I didn‚Äôt feel that way. He then again suggested we kiss and said it was ok as it‚Äôs the second date. I told him not today. 
I ended up leaving his car and told him I would give him time to think, after showing him evidence of my whole existence. He told me he will think more once he finally eats and maybe he will be able to think better then. 


So that is my story. I am surprised about this, is this a red flag? Am I a red flag? 

I don‚Äôt know what I did to make him not trust me or ‚Äòdissatisfied‚Äô with me‚Ä¶.

I just thought it was a bit strange as I automatically believed him and didn‚Äôt end up seeing 1 photo as evidence of what he told me, I showed him proof of my whole life and he didn‚Äôt believe me.

It tells the story of two girls, one who is an introverted science camp educator or something, and one who is a popular city girl who wants to be a model. Their families are going to switch places (that is, the city girl will be forced to move to the science camp and the science girl will be moving to the city) and both girls dread it.

They eventually get to know each other, and start to teach each other how to appreciate their future lives (Model girl has a moment where she's like, ""oh no, the nerdiness that I've suppressed is coming out again, maybe living out in the woods at a science camp isn't so bad"", and model girl teaches science girl how to be popular)

There is one scene that is especially memorable to me, which is at the beginning of the book. Model girl is going to a recruiting event where they are talking about what the job entails. The recruiter says ""You need to drink coffee and soda with a straw so it doesn't stain your teeth."" Two women leave the event saying they could never drink coffee with a straw, and the model girl thinks about how they wouldn't have a chance anyway because they were unattractive.

Another memorable scene is where the model girl teaches the science girl how to wash her hair properly - shampoo the roots only, and conditioner the rest of your hair.

I (21F) was walking down the road a few weeks ago, a guy (28M) came up to me while I was walking and asked for  my number. He commented how beautiful I am, asked me a little about myself what I was studying etc. He told me a little about him as well when I asked him. He said he was from Turkey. For reference I am from and living in Northern Europe. I was really hesitant so I didn‚Äôt give him my number but took his. After looking him up and verifying what he told me, I messaged him. We start texting and he was messaging me everyday. I am in university so it was difficult to message him all the time when he was texting me. We continued and he constantly asked when I would be available for a date. I wasn‚Äôt available during the weekdays as I have school. 
Also, Ramadan is talking place at the moment so he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to eat during the daytime if we met, but he still seemed keen to meet me.

I think contrasting the natural/wood color of these pieces and the design from the kitchen with black metal to give it that industrial vibe would go well.

Would love to get advice for some of the bigger items I need to purchase and what I could potentially do with this space. I was also planning on getting dim lights to give it that moody vibe as well.

1jix7eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1jix7eh/reduced_my_ldl_from_145_to_93_with_diet/,Reduced my LDL from 145 to 93 with diet,"I had my yearly checkup last fall and I was shocked to see how high my cholesterol was. 

I'm 39 years old, 5'1"", I weigh about 106 lbs, and I exercise 5x per week. I also had what I thought was a healthy diet: I'm pescatarian, I don't eat tons of junk food, don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol.

**My numbers in October 2024**

Total cholesterol: 221

LDL: 145

HDL: 58

Triglycerides: 92


I was determined to bring these numbers down, so I started tracking everything I eat. It was pretty eye-opening. Although I don't eat much processed food, I was consuming like 20+ grams of saturated fat per day. After making some changes to my diet, here are my updated numbers.

**My numbers in March 2025**

Total cholesterol: 153

LDL: 93

HDL: 52

Triglycerides: 63


**Where I was going wrong before:**

* It's hard for me to meet my protein goals, so I was making a big omelette for lunch every day. I'd typically use 2 eggs (3 grams saturated fat), 1/2 tbsp of butter (about 4 grams saturated fat), plus almost an ounce of cheese (there's another 5 grams). So my lunch alone had like 12+ grams of saturated fat.

* I was barely eating enough fiber. Most days I'd consume only 10-12 grams of fiber. I'd usually have a big salad with some salmon or tofu for dinner, but I realized my leafy green salads had very little fiber.

* I wasn't using paper filters when making coffee. I make pour-over coffee every morning, and I was just using the metal filter. I'm not sure how much this was actually contributing to my high cholesterol, but I've read it can increase LDL.

**What I changed**

* Reduced my saturated fat intake to no more than 10-12 grams per day. And increased my fiber to 30+ grams per day. This was really hard at first, but now I've totally adjusted to my new diet.

* I used to just eat toast and butter for breakfast. Now I make overnight oats with 1/2 cup oats, 3/4 cup soy milk, 1 container of Yoplait protein yogurt, and 1 tbsp of chia seeds. 

* For lunch I usually make quinoa bowls Greek style (I add chickpeas, cucumber, pickled red onions, fat free feta, and I drizzle in some yogurt/tahini dressing)

* Dinner is still a salad with protein most days, but now I add more fiber to my salads, like chickpeas or roasted veggies.

* I also eat way more beans. I love making savory butter beans (I add shallots, garlic, tomato paste, cherry tomatoes, aquafaba from the beans, and a little bit of reduced-fat cream cheese).

* I always use paper filters for my coffee now

**Tips**

* If you can't get all your fiber from your diet, supplements can help. Some days I take a couple tablespoons of psyllium husk. Or I eat some MetaMucil fiber gummies (these are soluble fiber gummies, which is the kind of fiber that reduces LDL.)

* If you miss eating potato chips, just get the baked version. I love Baked Lays, and they only have .5 gram saturated fat per serving.

* Try slow-churned ice cream if you need your ice cream fix.

1jiwwdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/1jiwwdo/fixing_and_tweaking_the_dreamworks_madagascar/,Fixing and tweaking the Dreamworks Madagascar movies,"**Madagascar:**

Honestly, this film is a classic and in my opinion nearly perfect, but while rewatching, I realized that there's one missed opportunity, the Chimps, we see them at the beginning of the film but then after they are put on the ship, we don't see them again until the very end. I think it would have been way better if they also washed ashore of Madagascar alongside the main characters and actually had some scenes on the island, also, in the opening scene we see that Phil had some sort of a drinking problem and was addicted to caffeine and root beer while at the end of the film we see that the apes started drinking tea, so why not turn it into their own mini arc in the film where they overcome coffee addiction and instead find tea to be better (maybe they would find tea in a crate that also washed ashore).

Oh and this is a VERY minor change but, Melman's tongue should have been blue, like in the case of real life Giraffes.

**Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa:**

Okay, this film is even better than the first one, but I feel like one scene could have been even more emotional

After Zuba said ""If you were a real Lion"" Alex would say ""Real lion... well, how am I supposed to know what it means to be a real lion when you weren‚Äôt there to teach me? For most of my life, I was the only lion I ever knew, I never fought, I never hunted, I had everything given to me on a literal silver platter, all because YOU couldn‚Äôt save me from being taken away"" before walking away.

Also, that's a small change, but while sleeping, Alex would suck his thumb (reference to the first film) and to add a nice bit of consistency to this film, in the opening scene Alex would still have the crown that Julien gave to him at the end of the first film, it would later get lost after the plane crash.

**Madagascar: Europe's Most Wanted**

Actually, I would rename it to ""Madagascar: 3urope's Most Wanted"" to keep it consistent with the pun name of the second film. Seriously, I don't get what is it with Dreamworks dropping the pun names, it was the same case with Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After (it should have been named **Four**ever After).

While I believe that this film, has some pretty nice scenes and the overall intention was good, it feels off, too goofy and exaggerated, it really jump the shark (though still not as much as the Penguins movie) especially in comparison to the previous two films, also, the message could have been executed way better, because in this film the animals learn that they actually want freedom... only to later join the circus, which is awful because in real life the circus is the last place where any animal would want to be,

So, my idea is to, pretty much completely redo and tweak the film but at the same time keep the overall idea.

The movie opens in Africa, we see poachers trapping various animals but Alex and his friends set them free behind their backs and then set trip wires and traps for the poachers, after tripping and getting beaten up by the traps the poachers are scared by Alex and run away. Who knows, maybe Alex can become somewhat of a star again, after all people in the second movie found out that he's alive in Africa, so maybe more and more people come to visit (perhaps Alex can do his iconic roar once more, but this time, without enclosures, without merchandise, just freely in the wilderness). Alex and Marty talk about how they make a great team before Marty shows Alex his birthday gift, the replica of New York made of mud. Alex gets nostalgic and thinks he misses New York and Marty, Melman and Gloria feel the same way, so they decide to go back.

When the Penguins return like they promised, Alex says goodbye to his parents while Moto Moto flexes and tries to impress Gloria by doing his usual ""focused on himself"" routine but Gloria doesn't really pay attention and instead tells Melman how happy she is that they will finally return home.

The animals arrive back at the zoo, it turns out it has been closed and it's way smaller than they remember, they feel weird now and realize that they already got what they wanted all along and they were truly happy in the wild, they tell the Penguins that they want to go back and Skipper says *""You're really indecisive, aren't you?""* but before the animals leave, they hear and later notice a circus in Central Park, right next to the zoo.

They decide to see what's going on in there and after accidentally entering the circus, they meet the circus animals, Vitali, Gia, Stefano and Sonya (Julien and Sonya can still fall in love, that was pretty funny). After a quick ""getting to know each other"" conversation, the circus animals tell the gang about their circus life, Alex and the rest realize that circus animals don't know the real meaning of life and real freedom, they've been trapped in the circus their whole lives without knowing it's bad for them, so Alex and his friends decide NOT to leave and to help the circus animals see what true freedom looks like instead.

Of course, just like in the movie, the circus goes on a trip throughout Europe, that doesn't change.

As for the villain, Chantel DuBois, yeah, she can stay, why not, her introduction scene was great, her personality and motivation were overall fitting, she simply should have been more grounded, that's all (also, I wish they kept the deleted shot of her opening a locked door using a tranquilizer dart, that was pretty smart). Just, after being defeated, the animals shouldn't have sent her to Madagascar, she wouldn't be trapped there with lemurs, the lemurs would be trapped with her, so instead, send her to Antarctica.

The rest of the movie is about Alex and his friends trying to convince the circus animals to live a free life but it's not easy as they have their own point of view and feel comfortable in the circus. At last, the gang is able to show true freedom to the circus animals, they all escape the circus and decide to finally go to their real, wild home.

At first they fly to Madagascar, Julien says hi to Stevie the gecko and announces that the king is back, Julien and Maurice stay on Madagascar, Mort tries to stay as well but Julien throws him back onto the plane in the last second. The animals return to Africa, Mort meets a group of Meerkats who call him their new king, the circus animals say that they like it here and Alex talks with his friends and remarks that they've come a long way and they are finally where they were always supposed to be. The movie ends with them sitting on a hill and watching the sunset.

Also, I feel like more could have been done with Gloria and Melman in this movie, maybe one of the circus animals is an orphan and they adopt it, anything to develop their relationship would be welcome.

Oh and I feel like Nana could have had a cameo somewhere, this movie doesn't feel complete without her.

That way, it would be a more thematically fitting ending.

**Penguins of Madagascar:**

Well, first off, when the Penguins are babies, they should have had baby voices instead of their regular adult voices.

Honestly, I think this movie should have been completely changed

The opening scene could be similar, but then, we should see baby penguins arriving at the zoo, growing up, figuring out all the military techniques perhaps by seeing them in a movie or a book (think of Splinter showing Ninjutsu to the baby Ninja turtles) having their first missions etc.

Yeah I would scrap Dave and North Wind completely and instead make it a simple, prequel film.

Also, I came up with a bit random but interesting post credit scene. In case you didn't know, Penguins of Madagascar also got a TV series BUT it's actually separate from the movies and it takes place in an alternate universe (it was confirmed by the show runner, though many people still don't know that) so, in the post credit scene, the Penguins from the movie could for example be seen sleeping inside their enclosure, at night, when the zoo is closed, but then a random portal appears, waking them up and grabbing their attention, on the other side, the versions of the penguins from the show can be seen, with Kowalski talking about his inter-dimensional machine, then we see penguins reacting to each other and doing some ""mirror gags"" before the portal closes and Private says ""well that was weird"", I feel like this would be a really interesting way of trying the movies and show together, referencing and explaining it.",2,1742838533.0,fixingmovies,0,1.0,False

Like many of you, I‚Äôve spent years collecting productivity advice like Pok√©mon cards. Morning routines, dopamine detoxes, Pomodoro timers, ‚Äújust do it‚Äù energy, etc. But recently I had a very normal thought:
‚ÄúWhat if I did ALL of it?‚Äù

I‚Äôm now 17 days deep into what I can only describe as a chaotic good routine, I feel great. Terrified, but great. Here‚Äôs what it looks like:

‚∏ª

1. Wake up at 5:00 AM ‚Äî because of course.
Slept through my alarm the first three days, but now I just wake up out of fear I‚Äôll ruin the streak. So technically‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs working?

2. First hour = no phone, no talking, no thinking.
Just black coffee, some stretching, and staring out the window like a Victorian ghost. It‚Äôs actually kind of peaceful. Highly recommend.

3. Cold shower (not freezing, but emotionally jarring)
I wouldn‚Äôt say it builds discipline as much as it builds resentment toward water. But hey, I‚Äôm awake now.

4. Breakfast of Champions‚Ñ¢: oatmeal, eggs, regret
Same meal every day. Takes 4 minutes. Tastes like routine. Smells like ambition. Saves time for overachieving.

5. Work blocks: 33 minutes on, 11 minutes off, repeat until I question reality
I use a tomato timer that ticks loudly enough to create a mild sense of danger. It works.

6. Movement = mandatory
Every hour I do one push-up or pace around like a CEO in a Netflix doc. It breaks up the existential dread of sitting still for too long.

7. The ‚Äú3-3-3‚Äù journal method
Every night: 3 wins, 3 losses, 3 plans for tomorrow. Bonus points if you pretend you‚Äôre reporting to an imaginary accountability coach named Darren. I do.

8. Zero dopamine activities after 8PM
No phone, no TV, no joy. I just read a book, drink herbal tea, and stare at the ceiling while my brain begs for cat videos. Apparently this is good for me.

9. My mantra: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust Future Me‚Äù
Future Me is a con artist. Present Me does all the work. Future Me reaps the benefits and takes all the credit. Never again.

‚∏ª

Has this made me more disciplined? Honestly‚Ä¶ yes.
Do I feel like a productivity-themed NPC? Also yes.
But I‚Äôm sleeping better, finishing more, and experiencing fewer existential crisises (crisii?). So I‚Äôll take the win.

Would love to hear what routines have worked for others‚Äîor if anyone else has accidentally gamified their entire life. 

Ask me about my Discord, where I'm exploiting people who are genuinely looking for advice, in order to feed machine learning, from which I will use the secretly gathered data to build an app and sell that thing for as much as possible per month.

I‚Äôve been battling a randomly nasty BV infection for the past several weeks with no solution in sight until recently. I have taken/tried several prescriptions, gone through multiple types of antibiotics with fidelity, diet changes, exercise, and made healthy lifestyle choices. I was beyond done and at a loss when none of this worked. What FINALLY worked for my body expelling itself from this nasty infection was this combination that I would like to share in case anyone else is in the same situation and/or tired of their BV infections as well:

1.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Probiotics: I tripled up taking probiotics every single day. Instead of taking just one I took three during the duration of the infection. Now that the BV is gone I will go back to taking just one a day. I had previously been using a $10 product I got from Walmart but after this infection started I paid for $60 pricier ones at CVS out of desperation and it seemed to work much better. I am going to stick with the $60 product from here on out. I can link in comments if there is an interest.
2.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Hormone regulations: I got my levels checked and my estrogen and testosterone levels were crazy out of whack. My endocrinologist wrote me a prescription for this and the discharge from the VB infection actually diminished slightly (but did not go away) after the first failed round of Metronidazole. I include this because I truly believe this is part of the magic formula that helped my body get rid of this nasty infection.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Boric Acid: I tried Boric Acid I found at CVS which did nothing. I found and paid for a pricey boric acid supplement I found online out of desperation tried and used it for a total of 7 nights. It worked magic and I‚Äôll link below if there is an interest.
4.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Natural Herbs: out of desperation for a BV solution after multiple Metronidazole prescriptions failed I went to a ‚Äúwitch doctor‚Äù to find natural remedies. I began using herbs she recommended to make them into teas I started drinking all day nonstop for three days to flush the infection of out my system. IT WORKED! Herbs infused in my tea: Calendula, Corn Silk/Husk, Cloves, Garlic, Lemon Tree Grass, and Cinnamon. It tastes strange but WORKS. If this not your belief system, fine, but IT WORKS and I encourage you to try it.
5.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Vitamin C Supplements: I took basic $7 Vitamin C tablets I got over the counter at Walmart. I believe it helped cleanse the infection out of my system.
6.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Diet: I made sure to only eat yogurt, fruits, vegetables, beans, rice, and some toast with cinnamon (see point 4). I also took some vitamins in the morning (L-Lysine, Magnesium, Vitamin C). I also cut out all drinks except water, the teas mentioned above, and coffee.
7.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚ÄúDaily‚Äù Products: the Metronizadole instructions for all three failed prescriptions instructed to avoid alcohol consumption (which I did) but I took it a step further. I went as far as to purchase toothpaste, mouthwash, shaving cream, shampoo and deodorant specifically with natural ingredients and that do not contain alcohol. I don‚Äôt wear makeup but if you check the ingredients in this product. I believe this helped!

This is the magic combination I used to finally get rid of such a nasty infection that popped up out of nowhere. I was done wearing 4-5 pads a day (and feeling the irritation from the pads rubbing against my legs on workdays), feeling ashamed and embarrassed, and being sexually abstinent. I hope this helped anyone on this sub who needed to read this.

**Why This Pick?**

The Chicago Bulls have put up 120 points or more in their last 3 straight games and have won 5 of their last 7 outings against some pretty tough teams. The Nuggets come into this meeting on the tail end of a back-to-back, and, if Nikola Jokic sits again, this should be an easy cover if not potential upset for the Bulls. With their last 5 games including two losses to teams like the Wizards & the Trail Blazers, I can‚Äôt comfortably back Denver without Jokic on the court. I‚Äôd definitely check the injury list before game time, but as it stands, I‚Äôm on Chicago to cover the spread here.

A cabin barndominium offers just that‚Äîa unique space that allows you to enjoy the best of both worlds. With its combination of cozy charm and updated amenities, it creates a welcoming environment that many dream about.

Cabin barndominiums stand tall as a solution for those wanting to escape the hustle and bustle of urban life while still enjoying the benefits of modern architecture. They often combine wood and metal, creating a striking visual appeal. The rustic elements like exposed beams, wooden fixtures, and stone fireplaces bring that earthy feel, making you feel at home with nature.

One of the greatest advantages of a cabin barndominium is its spacious layout. Unlike traditional homes that might feel cramped, these structures typically boast open floor plans. This design creates a sense of freedom and versatility within the space. You can easily organize the living area according to your own preferences. Moreover, the high ceilings and large windows enhance natural light, making the interiors feel bright and inviting.

In a cabin barndominium, modern technology seamlessly integrates into the rustic charm. You can enjoy the luxury of smart home features, energy-efficient appliances, and innovative heating and cooling systems. This allows you to maintain comfort and convenience without sacrificing the cozy environment that a cabin provides. Whether you're looking for climate control or advanced security solutions, the options are virtually endless.

Consider some essential features that make cabin barndominiums stand out:

- **Eco-Friendly Materials:** Many cabin barndominiums are built using sustainable materials that limit their environmental impact.
- **Energy Efficiency:** With superior insulation and solar panels, these homes are designed to reduce energy costs.
- **Adaptability:** The open space allows for various configurations, making it easy to add personal touches.
- **Outdoor Integration:** Large porches and decks can be added, allowing for seamless transitions between indoor and outdoor living.

Another undeniable charm of a cabin barndominium is its connection to the great outdoors. You have the luxury of choosing a location that reveals breathtaking views, like mountains, lakes, or open fields. Large windows and sliding glass doors can open to patios or decks where you can enjoy your morning coffee while soaking in stunning scenery. It‚Äôs an ideal setting for those who love nature.

Interior design in a cabin barndominium allows for an exciting mix of rustic and modern styles. You can incorporate vintage furniture that tells a story alongside sleek, contemporary pieces. Whether you favor a warm, earthy palette or a more vibrant selection of colors, the possibilities are endless in transforming the space into a reflection of your personality.

As you settle into a cabin barndominium, you may find it fosters a sense of community. Many people choose locations where they can engage with neighbors‚Äîsharing outdoor spaces or communal activities. This atmosphere enhances the experience of living in a cabin, as friendships can blossom in this homey environment.

Living in one of these unique homes doesn‚Äôt just provide shelter; it cultivates a lifestyle that emphasizes simplicity, comfort, and a connection to nature. It‚Äôs perfect for families or individuals who are looking to lead a more serene life without sacrificing modern comforts. As more people begin to explore cabin barndominiums, the demand for these multifaceted spaces continues to rise.

</div>Key Design Features to Consider When Building Your Cabin Barndominium
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When you're dreaming of the perfect home, a cabin barndominium can offer a unique blend of rustic charm and modern comfort. This style of home combines the sturdy construction of a barn with the cozy features of a cabin, making it an appealing option for many. If you're considering building your own cabin barndominium, there are several key design features you should keep in mind to ensure that your new home is both functional and visually appealing.

### Open Floor Plan

An open floor plan is one of the most desirable features of a cabin barndominium. This design creates a spacious feeling in your living area and encourages social interaction. When you have a wide-open space that combines the kitchen, dining, and living rooms, you can enjoy family gatherings or entertain friends without feeling cramped. This layout also allows for plenty of natural light, which enhances the warmth of your cabin.

### Natural Materials

Natural materials into your cabin barndominium will enhance its rustic appeal. Consider using wood for flooring, exposed beams, and accents. Not only does wood create warmth and comfort, but it also ties your home to the beautiful natural surroundings. Stone elements, whether as part of the foundation or as a fireplace, can add another layer of texture and visual interest.

### Energy Efficiency

Building an energy-efficient cabin barndominium can save you money in the long run. Think about installing energy-efficient windows and doors, which can provide better insulation. Proper insulation throughout the walls and roof is essential to keep your home comfortable in all seasons. Solar panels are another excellent addition, as they can reduce your reliance on traditional energy sources.

### Functional Outdoor Space

Don‚Äôt underestimate the value of outdoor spaces when designing your cabin barndominium. Decks, porches, or patios can create additional living areas that are perfect for enjoying nature. You might consider extending your living space outdoors with seating areas, a fire pit, or even an outdoor kitchen. These features will help you connect with the natural beauty around your home.

### Customizable Layout

One of the best things about a barndominium is that the layout can be customized to meet your specific needs. Depending on your lifestyle, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms you require can greatly affect your design choices. You may want a master suite with a private bath or additional guest rooms for family and friends. Flexibility in design allows you to create a space that truly feels like home.

### Modern Amenities

While charm is important, don‚Äôt overlook modern amenities. modern appliances in your kitchen can make daily tasks easier and more enjoyable. Think about features like a large farmhouse sink, a double oven, or an island with seating. Additionally, comfortable bathrooms with updated fixtures can enhance the overall experience of your cabin. Consider things like heated floors or a spa-like shower for added luxury.

### Lighting Design

The right lighting can set the mood for your cabin barndominium, making it feel warm and inviting. Layered lighting that includes ambient, task, and accent illumination can create functional spaces. Large windows not only bring in natural light but also frame beautiful views. Consider pendant lights over your kitchen island and sconces in the living areas to add character and charm.

### Smart Home Technology

Integrating smart home technology into your cabin barndominium can enhance your comfort and security. Thermostats, lighting, and security systems that can be controlled from your smartphone can greatly improve your living experience. These elements can make your cabin not only more functional but also more responsive to your lifestyle needs.

### Personal Touches

Don‚Äôt forget to add personal touches that reflect your style and personality. Whether it's through artwork, color choices, or furniture selections, your cabin barndominium should feel uniquely yours. Incorporate elements that remind you of cherished memories or places you love, adding to the sentimental value of your home.

By carefully considering these key design features, you can create a cabin barndominium that beautifully marries rustic charm with modern conveniences. Each design choice can enhance your living experience, making this dual-function space the ideal retreat for you and your family.

### Conclusion

A Cabin Barndominium truly offers the best of both worlds, seamlessly blending the rustic charm of traditional cabins with the modern conveniences of contemporary living. Imagine waking up in a space that reflects the beauty of nature while providing the comforts and functionality you desire. This unique combination creates an inviting atmosphere perfect for both relaxation and entertaining.

When building your Cabin Barndominium, carefully consider key design features that enhance this magical blend. From the open floor plan that encourages a sense of togetherness to the large windows that frame stunning outdoor views, every detail counts. natural materials like wood and stone not only adds character but also connects your living space to the surrounding environment. Don't overlook practical elements such as energy efficiency, cozy fireplaces, and versatile outdoor spaces, all of which enhance your quality of life.

A Cabin Barndominium is more than just a home; it‚Äôs a lifestyle choice that allows you to enjoy the serene beauty of nature while having all the modern comforts at your fingertips. As you envision your dream home, think about how you can blend these elements to create a space that's uniquely yours, reflecting both personal style and the joys of cabin living. With thoughtful planning and creativity, your Cabin Barndominium can become a sanctuary that fulfills your desire for comfort and stunning aesthetics, providing a haven amidst the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Embrace the harmony of rustic charm and modern living, and watch your dream home come to life.",1,1742838153.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

Desperate for help 


I've had ongoing health issues since Jan 2023, waiting on hospital referrals as they have no idea what the problem is. 


I've been waiting on an answer for over 2 years and am no further really, am just asking for a rough guide to mention when I finally have my referral with the gastro in May. 


Symptoms have changed over time so I will summarise as much as I can. So far the suspected diagnoses are dysautonomia and some form of gastro problem - SIBO or an IBD. 


Jan 2023: 
I started with what I didn't know was B12 deficiency symptoms and nerve pain - mainly in left hand and arm. 
My hair started falling out in 2022 and it got worse. 
I ended up having B12, folate, vit D and other deficiencies (treated and supplemented every day not a problem anymore)



April 2023 - December 2023:


- Started feeling restless all the time, body temperature was dysregulated - hot to cold quickly and never matching the temperature as anyone else. And cold hands and feet but boiling torso
(I've never been able to sweat properly with anhydrosis and always overheated my whole life until then, now I have night sweats and am sweating most of the time) (ongoing)

- Lost my appetite and started losing weight - from here to August 2023 I ended up going from 61/62kg to 55/56 completely not out of choice. 
Anything I ate would come out the other end and I wasn't hungry properly for months 

- Fast heartbeat (nowadays resting can be 100+ for no reason, doctors have dismissed it and told me to take it easy. I've been on Clonazepam for years which should lower my heartbeat?? But hasn't?)

- I had palpitations and shortness of breath

- Felt like low blood sugar episodes 

- Chronic insomnia (ongoing)

- My eyesight started to deteriorate, I now need glasses. Have chronic dry eyes and dry mouth, night blindness and sunlight sensitivity (ongoing)

- Migraines and headaches (ongoing)

- Need to urinate all the time (ongoing)

- Stool isn't hard anymore (ongoing) soft and fluffy stool with undigested food

- Feels like heart pain and fluttering

- Wake up with nausea and hunger (ongoing)

- Stool urgency (ongoing)

- Brain fog - chronic (ongoing)

- Chronic fatigue (restlessness turned to fatigue)

- Itchy body / allergy symptoms all the time

- Constant dehydration no matter how much I drank 



Post December 2023:

The restlessness turned into chronic fatigue especially after eating. Now it's not there so much after eating but am fatigued all the time, my brain doesn't even work anymore and I need coffee and another form of caffeine in the day to function. 


- Exhaustion 

- Lower left abdominal pain (descending colon and sometimes on the right side) 
It is excruciating and alternates from a cramping stabby pain, to a bowel movement and cramps and urgency, to a dull achy pain like it's bruised internally as if someone has been squeezing my intestines. 

- Joint pain (my mother and sister have hEDS and I believe I do too as I have very flexible joints, but when I'm in a flare my joints are stiff and painful and make cracking noises constantly)

- Memory loss especially short term

- Awful trapped wind pain, almost crying. Simethicone and Loperamide have been the only relievers 

- Coathanger pain and constantly tense upper shoulders

- Sensitive muscles 

- Nausea and lightheadedness when overheating especially if having walked or ran (I got heat exhaustion in the summer)

- Terrible immune system 

- Sometimes my pain feels like hunger pain gnawing away like an ulcer in intestine and actual stomach

- Easy bruising since Feb 2023 - even if I haven't touched anything random small bruises on upper thighs

- Depressed and more sensitive

- Really loud growling abdomen

- Malodorous stool, can smell like chemicals, and really really bitter, it can smell almost sulfuric or sweet

- Fat malabsorption especially in stool, very fluffy but never watery diarrhea. Floating sometimes and mushy. Quite a few bowel movements a day 

- Pale skin

- From having no appetite a year ago, now my body can't decide if it's hungry and when it is it comes out of nowhere as if I'm absolutely starving and I get faint even if I wasn't hungry a minute before. I've gained the weight back now

- Gassy

- Inflammation on left side of abdomen, doctor felt it too

- Acne that won't go away 

Sometimes when the abdomen pain is inflamed and excruciating, it radiates to my lower back



Long story short, it's ruining my life. They have 
referred me to a gastro under potential IBD as my calprotectin came back at 506. 

They've ruled out: h. pylori, celiac, thyroid, adrenal glands, multiple things

I have my blood results from most tests if needed. Any help is saving my life. Thank you so much",1,1742838115.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

20-30 min of yoga (guided by Peloton)  
Dan John's Humane Burpee  
repeat 4-5x per week

My ability to stick to routines has been one of my favorite benefits of quitting drinking. I've managed to learn to get up around the same time every day, take the time to make fresh coffee, meditate, breathwork, and workout. Not every day, but regularly.

I've noticed that different routines and exercise programs suit me better at different times of the year. This routine is what's working for me right now - the stability, hip and core work in yoga is what my body needs for practical strength and healing, and the Humane Burpee is a tough but doable HIIT challenge every day.

Find what works for you right now, and get into a routine. Don't be afraid to switch it up after a few months.",13,1742838088.0,stopdrinkingfitness,0,1.0,False
1jiwpa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jiwpa3/i_think_my_abusive_fianc√©_is_cheating_on_me_long/,I think my abusive fianc√© is cheating on me (LONG),"My fianc√© (25M) and I (23F) have been together since 2019. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs as I went to college, moved in with roommates, and eventually moved in together.  However, lately I‚Äôm starting to think that he might be cheating on me. I‚Äôm heartbroken at the thought because he just recently proposed in January.

Some context: We‚Äôve always had some issues like most couples, but they‚Äôve gotten a lot better over the years and we‚Äôve gotten really good with handling and understanding each other. Sharing location has been a reoccurring topic. We‚Äôve gone back and forth on sharing and not sharing as sometimes it‚Äôs made is both overthink and other times it‚Äôs genuinely just for safety when we go out separately.

This main problem started back in December 2024 when he told me he was going out with his guy friends. They‚Äôve gone out before and I know them all as well. We weren‚Äôt sharing location at this point and I told him OK have fun and I stayed home and did some chores. 30-45 minutes go by and I realized I wanted to have his location because he friend was driving him so I wanted to ensure he got to the place safe. So I texted him saying ‚ÄúHey for safety reasons can you share your location so I know you got there safe‚Äù. I even offered to pick him up if they all wanted to have a few drinks he never responded. I called him multiple times to try and get ahold of him. He was in an accident about a year prior and broke his neck so I began to get a little anxious. I kept calling he wasn‚Äôt answering. I took measures in my own hands, and I got on his laptop, signed into his Apple account and checked his location through the Find My iPhone. 

Guess what, he was actually still at our apartment complex‚Ä¶ in a different apartment. Who‚Äôs? The apartment of his female coworker (21F), who just recently moved in. I was angry. I started pacing around wondering what to do. I walked over to the apartment just to see if maybe I could see them or her or anything really. I couldn‚Äôt hear or see anything. I went back to our apartment and got back on his laptop and played the Find My iPhone ringer so he knew that I was looking for him bc he was obviously avoiding my texts and calls. 

He called me a few minutes later, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm just getting home.‚Äù I started to go off and telling him that he needed to get home right now, I didn‚Äôt care where he was. He got home and was visibly drunk. At first he insisted that he was with the guys nothing happened and wasn‚Äôt sure why I was overreacting. He got on the toilet and then I noticed long blonde dog hair on him, his female coworker owns a golden retriever. I then laughed and said so that‚Äôs why you have her dog‚Äôs hair all over you. I started to walk to the door and leave because I was livid. He literally ran pants at his ankles and begged me not to leave. He then finally admitted he saw the coworker when his friend dropped him off and then he went in to her apartment and talked to her for a little bit. He insisted that all they did was talk. He basically begged me that saying that nothing happened and then he loves me and cried saying he could never do that to me. I choose to believe him. However, I still felt betrayed. He broke my trust. Why didn‚Äôt he just say something if it was innocent? Why didn‚Äôt he just say hey babe I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm safe. I stopped at my coworkers apartment for a sec. This is when my distrust in him really began.

The next day was a big work event for me so I basically disassociated all day, but I was still very heartbroken and confused on why he would lie. That entire week I was still feeling very anxious but still wanted to be with him. The next Friday all of his coworkers including her came over for games and drinks after their corporate Christmas Party. We played card games and I might be reading into it but I felt like my boyfriend was kind of hovering around her and joking with her and smiling a lot. Like I‚Äôm sitting at the table with the others and he choose to stand in the kitchen next to her. It really rubbed me the wrong way after everything that happened.
 
Because of my feelings the night before I woke up early and checked his phone. There was nothing super incriminating or definitive however it didn‚Äôt look like he actually called/texted his guy friends that night he was supposed to be with them. So now I‚Äôm not even sure if even actually went anywhere that night besides her place. The only thing that really made me unsettled is a text on Instagram in the disappearing messages to his female coworker that said ‚ÄúI just want to see you.‚Äú This honestly made me sick. Because why the hell are you saying that to any another woman besides me. 

I brought it up to him. He got mad and tried to explain and gaslit me basically. I let it go. Honestly, because I was scared. He made me delete the pictures of the text, which now I regret. The reality is, he‚Äôs abusive. I‚Äôve never told anyone or even typed it out. On many occasions over 3 years he‚Äôs either smacked me in the head, punched me in my stomach, made my nose bleed, choked me, kneed me in the gut, etc. It‚Äôs been as simply as a single smack to the head or actually wailing on me. It was never a daily or even monthly occurrence. He grew up with a really abusive family so I constantly tried to explain it away like it was because he was getting extremely triggered and was trauma responding. However I always knew deep down it‚Äôs not okay. He‚Äôs also verbally abusive, calling em names and breaking down and trashing on my character all the time. 


I went out with a girlfriend to the movies and as I drove back home that text he sent her was bouncing around in my head. I called him and said I didn‚Äôt wanna come home because I was pissed off. I was angry and I just truly didn‚Äôt understand why he did this and why he lied and even doubled down on the lie when he got home. I was driving in random directions and he was constantly saying he was sorry he was begging me to come home that he loves me. I get home after about an hour of going back and forth on the phone. 

He calmly opens the door for me, takes off my shoes, and brings my to the bedroom. And he starts wailing on me, that night ended in me having two black eyes and him having scratches all over him. Afterwards he just kept saying he doesn‚Äôt even remember hitting my eyes. (I wish I took pictures, I have no evidence of the abuse he‚Äôs put me through). He acted very sorry and remorseful the entire two weeks I have the bruises. I wore a lot of makeup those weeks. After that, I decided to just let it go. I didn‚Äôt want to go through this anymore. I didn‚Äôt want to be anxious so I stopped bringing it up for a while no matter how much it bothered me. I would occasionally share with him that I was felt a little anxious to test the waters and sometimes we would be comforting and reassuring and other times he got mad so I just shut down. 

Fast-forward to January he proposes. We were doing great so I say yes because I still fucking love him and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. However I honestly believe not that he just proposed to distract me. I‚Äôm pretty sure he threw the plan all together in like 2 weeks. I had a feeling it was coming so I helped book a hotel, make the plans, etc. We even went out and bought the ring together. I was still so happy and excited. That weekend of that trip, he was the best version of himself I‚Äôve ever seen. He was very caring, loving, patient, and more. When we got back home, he went back to his normal self. It honestly gave me whiplash. 

Past few months have been OK we‚Äôve been our regular normal. I‚Äôve occasionally gone through his phone. Each time I don‚Äôt find anything, but I just know that he is deleting shit. I know he is hiding shit. One morning I got fed up and left that morning to go to a coffee shop before he woke up. Turned off all my location and texted him I didn‚Äôt wanna come back for a few hours and I needed some time. Eventually he called me asked if I was ok. I told him no and I wanted him to tell me anything he‚Äôs been hiding or lied about. He gave me some BS but one this he did admit was that he signed up for a free trial of Blue Chew (an erection pill basically). We regularly have sex everyday and he‚Äôs never had a problem with staying hard until recently, he‚Äôs been softer than normal. I made a small comment one night just asking if he was OK. He said that‚Äôs what spurred him to go and try the supplements. I told him I was sorry and I didn‚Äôt wanna make him feel that way and I was still very much enjoying sex. We resolved some things and I came home, no abuse but I did get shouted at in the face. I guess I‚Äôm glad he held back. 

Come to know I find out he‚Äôs got an actual monthly subscription. He didn‚Äôt admit that to me, I found out through his credit card. I also found them hidden in a closet and he got mad at me and started asking why I was going through his mail. I put it back and said I was sorry. Next month, new package. Still his that one from me, I saw him bring it home on the Ring. 

Recently I noticed it was messed with like he recently went in it. I was on my period and we hadn‚Äôt had sex in days. He came in and asked what I was doing, I put the box I had in my hands in the closet and acted like I didn‚Äôt see it. Next thing you know he has put them away and hid them behind other boxes.

Then I went in and counted them. They were 4 missing from the big pack hidden in the closet and 2 missing from the trial pack in our nightstand. I knew he only used them twice with me so I know the ones from the trial pack he used with me. Not sure who he used the 4 other ones with. I‚Äôve also noticed during sex, he hasn‚Äôt been as hard in general. Doesn‚Äôt really like looking in the eye and wants me to stay quiet.

I‚Äôm a huge YNAB fan, but lately, something‚Äôs been bugging me:

I live in a region where YNAB doesn‚Äôt support bank sync, yet I‚Äôm paying the same price as folks who have it easy. Manually entering every coffee run, grocery purchase, and tiny expense‚Äîit‚Äôs tedious, and honestly, it feels unfair. Especially when incomes here don‚Äôt stretch as far.

So, here‚Äôs an idea: **What if we built a budgeting app specifically tailored for regions without bank sync?**

Imagine having all the **awesome YNAB features we love‚Äîbeautiful, intuitive UI, mobile app, widgets , customized reports**; effortless budgeting workflows; and motivating tools‚Äîbut without bank integration and at a truly fair price.

# I genuinely need your help to validate this idea:

* **What‚Äôs a fair monthly/yearly price** you‚Äôd happily pay for a premium budgeting experience without bank sync?
* **Which features are non-negotiable for your ideal budgeting app?**
* **Have you ever felt frustrated with YNAB‚Äôs pricing due to the lack of regional adjustments?**

Podrazumeva se da je film vrh. Do sada mislim da mi je jedini film koji se uklapa u tu kategoriju bio Eden Lake. 

Dodao bih jo≈° filmova koje nisam i ne bih nikad pogledao ponovo.

Bedevilled (Korejski)
Speak No Evil (original Danski)
Mother!
Hereditary

Plus te≈°ki filmovi uznemirujuƒái koje sam gledao ponovo da bih bolje razumeo priƒçu. A Tale of 2 Sisters (korejski), The Wailing (korejski) i jo≈° par korejskih (ne Parazit, Oldboy, I saw the devil i ne voz do Busana), Cure i Charisma (Kurosawa, Japanski).

E sada na temu. Svi ovi filmovi su te≈°ki, zastra≈°ujuƒái i uznemirijuƒái. Neki kao npr Mother idu u neke krajnosti i forsiraju ultra nasilje i zastra≈°ivanje radi efekta. A Sto za kafenisanje? Ne znam ≈°ta bih rekao. Nula nasilja, blizu nula nekih ludih de≈°avanja, sve je realno i mo≈æe da se desi bilo kome i svi likovi deluju prirodno. Ba≈° kao da su tvoje kom≈°ije, prijatelji i ti si tu sa njima‚Ä¶ A sve vreme sam bio na ivici i preznojavao se, hteo da iskoƒçim iz svoje ko≈æe jer sam se poistovetio sa svima njima kao nikad. Posebno sa glavnim likom, naravno. Posle ovog filma, svi mi drugi deluju kao ≈°ala. Sve je nekako drugaƒçije. Eden Lake sam stavio jer me je uƒçinio da se oseƒáam najsliƒçnije tome, ali tu likovi prave glupe gre≈°ke koje ja ne mogu da pojmim, dok ovde toga nema. 

Film je zaradio 28.000$ i sniman je 10 dana. Gledao sam manje vi≈°e sve top horore i trilere, ali ovaj film me dr≈æi mesecima od kad sam ga pogledao. I nema teorije da ga pogledam opet, ne jer se pla≈°im i imam traume, veƒá to jedno iskustvo je sve ≈°to mi treba. Totalno drugaƒçiji film od svih, za mene top1 u ovom ≈æanru uznemirujuƒáih filmova i te≈°ko da mi je neki drugi film bio blizu tog nivoa utiska.

1jiwldx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jiwldx/aio_i_think_my_fianc√©_is_cheating_on_me/,"AIO, I think my fianc√© is cheating on me‚Ä¶","Long Story‚Ä¶

My fianc√© (25M) and I (23F) have been together since 2019. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs as I went to college, moved in with roommates, and eventually moved in together.  However, lately I‚Äôm starting to think that he might be cheating on me. I‚Äôm heartbroken at the thought because he just recently proposed in January.

Some context: We‚Äôve always had some issues like most couples, but they‚Äôve gotten a lot better over the years and we‚Äôve gotten really good with handling and understanding each other. Sharing location has been a reoccurring topic. We‚Äôve gone back and forth on sharing and not sharing as sometimes it‚Äôs made is both overthink and other times it‚Äôs genuinely just for safety when we go out separately.

This main problem started back in December 2024 when he told me he was going out with his guy friends. They‚Äôve gone out before and I know them all as well. We weren‚Äôt sharing location at this point and I told him OK have fun and I stayed home and did some chores. 30-45 minutes go by and I realized I wanted to have his location because he friend was driving him so I wanted to ensure he got to the place safe. So I texted him saying ‚ÄúHey for safety reasons can you share your location so I know you got there safe‚Äù. I even offered to pick him up if they all wanted to have a few drinks he never responded. I called him multiple times to try and get ahold of him. He was in an accident about a year prior and broke his neck so I began to get a little anxious. I kept calling he wasn‚Äôt answering. I took measures in my own hands, and I got on his laptop, signed into his Apple account and checked his location through the Find My iPhone. 

Guess what, he was actually still at our apartment complex‚Ä¶ in a different apartment. Who‚Äôs? The apartment of his female coworker (21F), who just recently moved in. I was angry. I started pacing around wondering what to do. I walked over to the apartment just to see if maybe I could see them or her or anything really. I couldn‚Äôt hear or see anything. I went back to our apartment and got back on his laptop and played the Find My iPhone ringer so he knew that I was looking for him bc he was obviously avoiding my texts and calls. 

He called me a few minutes later, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm just getting home.‚Äù I started to go off and telling him that he needed to get home right now, I didn‚Äôt care where he was. He got home and was visibly drunk. At first he insisted that he was with the guys nothing happened and wasn‚Äôt sure why I was overreacting. He got on the toilet and then I noticed long blonde dog hair on him, his female coworker owns a golden retriever. I then laughed and said so that‚Äôs why you have her dog‚Äôs hair all over you. I started to walk to the door and leave because I was livid. He literally ran pants at his ankles and begged me not to leave. He then finally admitted he saw the coworker when his friend dropped him off and then he went in to her apartment and talked to her for a little bit. He insisted that all they did was talk. He basically begged me that saying that nothing happened and then he loves me and cried saying he could never do that to me. I choose to believe him. However, I still felt betrayed. He broke my trust. Why didn‚Äôt he just say something if it was innocent? Why didn‚Äôt he just say hey babe I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm safe. I stopped at my coworkers apartment for a sec. This is when my distrust in him really began.

The next day was a big work event for me so I basically disassociated all day, but I was still very heartbroken and confused on why he would lie. That entire week I was still feeling very anxious but still wanted to be with him. The next Friday all of his coworkers including her came over for games and drinks after their corporate Christmas Party. We played card games and I might be reading into it but I felt like my boyfriend was kind of hovering around her and joking with her and smiling a lot. Like I‚Äôm sitting at the table with the others and he choose to stand in the kitchen next to her. It really rubbed me the wrong way after everything that happened.
 
Because of my feelings the night before I woke up early and checked his phone. There was nothing super incriminating or definitive however it didn‚Äôt look like he actually called/texted his guy friends that night he was supposed to be with them. So now I‚Äôm not even sure if even actually went anywhere that night besides her place. The only thing that really made me unsettled is a text on Instagram in the disappearing messages to his female coworker that said ‚ÄúI just want to see you.‚Äú This honestly made me sick. Because why the hell are you saying that to any another woman besides me. 

I brought it up to him. He got mad and tried to explain and gaslit me basically. I let it go. Honestly, because I was scared. He made me delete the pictures of the text, which now I regret. The reality is, he‚Äôs abusive. I‚Äôve never told anyone or even typed it out. On many occasions over 3 years he‚Äôs either smacked me in the head, punched me in my stomach, made my nose bleed, choked me, kneed me in the gut, etc. It‚Äôs been as simply as a single smack to the head or actually wailing on me. It was never a daily or even monthly occurrence. He grew up with a really abusive family so I constantly tried to explain it away like it was because he was getting extremely triggered and was trauma responding. However I always knew deep down it‚Äôs not okay. He‚Äôs also verbally abusive, calling em names and breaking down and trashing on my character all the time. 


I went out with a girlfriend to the movies and as I drove back home that text he sent her was bouncing around in my head. I called him and said I didn‚Äôt wanna come home because I was pissed off. I was angry and I just truly didn‚Äôt understand why he did this and why he lied and even doubled down on the lie when he got home. I was driving in random directions and he was constantly saying he was sorry he was begging me to come home that he loves me. I get home after about an hour of going back and forth on the phone. 

He calmly opens the door for me, takes off my shoes, and brings my to the bedroom. And he starts wailing on me, that night ended in me having two black eyes and him having scratches all over him. Afterwards he just kept saying he doesn‚Äôt even remember hitting my eyes. (I wish I took pictures, I have no evidence of the abuse he‚Äôs put me through). He acted very sorry and remorseful the entire two weeks I have the bruises. I wore a lot of makeup those weeks. After that, I decided to just let it go. I didn‚Äôt want to go through this anymore. I didn‚Äôt want to be anxious so I stopped bringing it up for a while no matter how much it bothered me. I would occasionally share with him that I was felt a little anxious to test the waters and sometimes we would be comforting and reassuring and other times he got mad so I just shut down. 

Fast-forward to January he proposes. We were doing great so I say yes because I still fucking love him and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. However I honestly believe not that he just proposed to distract me. I‚Äôm pretty sure he threw the plan all together in like 2 weeks. I had a feeling it was coming so I helped book a hotel, make the plans, etc. We even went out and bought the ring together. I was still so happy and excited. That weekend of that trip, he was the best version of himself I‚Äôve ever seen. He was very caring, loving, patient, and more. When we got back home, he went back to his normal self. It honestly gave me whiplash. 

Past few months have been OK we‚Äôve been our regular normal. I‚Äôve occasionally gone through his phone. Each time I don‚Äôt find anything, but I just know that he is deleting shit. I know he is hiding shit. One morning I got fed up and left that morning to go to a coffee shop before he woke up. Turned off all my location and texted him I didn‚Äôt wanna come back for a few hours and I needed some time. Eventually he called me asked if I was ok. I told him no and I wanted him to tell me anything he‚Äôs been hiding or lied about. He gave me some BS but one this he did admit was that he signed up for a free trial of Blue Chew (an erection pill basically). We regularly have sex everyday and he‚Äôs never had a problem with staying hard until recently, he‚Äôs been softer than normal. I made a small comment one night just asking if he was OK. He said that‚Äôs what spurred him to go and try the supplements. I told him I was sorry and I didn‚Äôt wanna make him feel that way and I was still very much enjoying sex. We resolved some things and I came home, no abuse but I did get shouted at in the face. I guess I‚Äôm glad he held back. 

Come to know I find out he‚Äôs got an actual monthly subscription. He didn‚Äôt admit that to me, I found out through his credit card. I also found them hidden in a closet and he got mad at me and started asking why I was going through his mail. I put it back and said I was sorry. Next month, new package. Still his that one from me, I saw him bring it home on the Ring. 

Recently I noticed it was messed with like he recently went in it. I was on my period and we hadn‚Äôt had sex in days. He came in and asked what I was doing, I put the box I had in my hands in the closet and acted like I didn‚Äôt see it. Next thing you know he has put them away and hid them behind other boxes.

Then I went in and counted them. They were 4 missing from the big pack hidden in the closet and 2 missing from the trial pack in our nightstand. I knew he only used them twice with me so I know the ones from the trial pack he used with me. Not sure who he used the 4 other ones with. I‚Äôve also noticed during sex, he hasn‚Äôt been as hard in general. Doesn‚Äôt really like looking in the eye and wants me to stay quiet. I thought it was just a focusing issue at first but now I‚Äôm realizing that might be more. What‚Äôs killing me that he‚Äôs never going to admit unless I catch him with undeniable evidence. I don‚Äôt know how to get that because it seems like he‚Äôs not fucking someone else regularly but on rare occasions.

I‚Äôm about to head to Japan in the next week or so and I‚Äôll be visiting a few makers. To thank them for welcoming me in, I want to bring some gifts, but I could use some help. 

So that leads me to the whole point of this post: what are some of the best gifts to bring Japanese blacksmiths and sharpeners?

I am visiting Takada-san and Shibata-san personally at their workshops and finding gifts for each of them is my biggest priority. 

I know Shibata-san loves his Harley Davidson motorcycles so I‚Äôm bringing a vintage Harley pin as well as a Harley Davidson coffee mug. I also plan to grab a fabric Trader Joe‚Äôs tote bag full of American snacks and treats. Anything else he likes or any other good gift ideas? I know he loves fishing, but I‚Äôm assuming he has the best of everything and I know next to nothing about fishing lol

I‚Äôm doing the same Trader Joe‚Äôs bag full of snacks for Takada-san, but I want to find something more personal if possible. I have a friend who makes some pottery and I‚Äôm considering giving him a handmade flower pot. I would love any other ideas if anyone has any. 

I‚Äôll also be visiting Baba Hamono, Konosuke Knife Company, Sakai Takayuki Knife Gallery and the Sakai Traditional Crafts Museum. Would it be out of place to bring any of these locations a little gift bag? I‚Äôm guessing gifts would be overzealous at the Knife Museum and Sakai Takayuki Knife Gallery, but not for Konosuke and Baba. 

Lastly, I‚Äôll be heading to Morihei and Hitohira in Tokyo but I don‚Äôt know if gifts make sense at those locations either. 

I know this is a weird question, but any and all input ‚Äî regardless how out there the advice is ‚Äî would be extremely helpful.

My partner and I recently moved into this gorgeous brownstone and need help warming up my living room. We‚Äôre aiming for a cozy, plant-filled space similar to what we‚Äôve achieved in our kitchen (photos included for reference).

1. Layout Dilemma: Our couch and TV seem to only work in their current configuration, but this creates an awkward dead space between the fireplace wall and couch. How can we better utilize this area?

2. Window Treatments: The windows are beautiful but bare. What curtain style, length, and color would complement the space while adding warmth?

3. Overall Warmth: Despite the beautiful bones, the room still feels sterile and unfinished. We‚Äôd love suggestions for:
-Area rug recommendations (size, pattern, color)
-Coffee table options that would work with our space
-Wall art or decor that would enhance the coziness
-Lighting solutions beyond the overhead fixture
-Plant suggestions that would thrive in this lighting

Room Details:
-Room dimensions: 16‚Äôx10‚Äù x 15‚Äôx4‚Äù (I attached the living room floor plan)
-Natural light: north facing
-Elements we can‚Äôt change: flooring, fixtures
-Budget range: flexible
-Existing pieces we want to keep: all furniture listed

1jiwhmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1jiwhmf/omeprazole_was_my_problem/,Omeprazole was my problem....,"Ok here we go...summer of 2024 I had issues with what I assumed was gastritis or gerd. Pain in the upper left quadrant, and a VERY liquidy acidy feeling stomach, nausea. The works. My GP put me on 20mg Omeprazole daily and said it was such a low dose it was ok to take daily and it would help. After the first two weeks on the meds I felt amazing. I weaned off and felt yucky still so I went back on and then just decided to stay on them. I was able to eat whatever I wanted on them and felt fine! Flashforward to January of 2025. I started to feel that pain in the quadrant again, and it was worse. But that came along with joint pain, headaches, lots of intestinal issues, malabsorption etc. I couldn't figure out what was going on. For almost three months I couldn't eat anything but white rice and plain baked potatoes. I tried everything, supplements, vitamins, probiotics, digestive enzymes etc. I could not figure it out. One day I say screw this and decided to wean off the Omeprazole to see if I could try something else. And poof....the pain was gone. My appetite was back, my bowel problems were gone. My joint pain gone. Everything is returning to normal. I ate chocolate, pizza, and drank coffee. This morning I had a cinnamon roll. Long story short...my case was a weird one. The Omeprazole was causing all my problems. I think I had a case of acute gastritis last summer and once I healed it I just kept taking the meds. Careful taking this medicine. They aren't kidding...it really isn't for long term use. Good luck and happy healing!!",3,1742837562.0,Gastritis,7,1.0,False

1jiweqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/comments/1jiweqt/some_advice_from_an_italian_living_in_italy_to/,Some advice from an Italian living in Italy to those who want to travel to Italy to avoid scams,"Given my post yesterday about what Egyptians thought of Italy and Italians and your positive responses, in which some of you even expressed the desire to come to Italy as tourists one day, I took the liberty of listing the main scams and rip-offs that unfortunately usually occur in my country to the detriment of tourists. 

If you go to Rome or the main Italian cities, pay close attention to these things:

- Never accept bracelets or necklaces from those who tell you that they are gifts, they are never gifts and will probably ask you for money back. Sometimes they throw you the bracelet so that you instinctively take it and then, as above, they try to convince you to take something out to send them away. The only advice in these cases is to completely ignore these people and not stop to talk to them at all, even at the risk of being considered rude.

- In Florence, some guys put fake paintings on the ground in the middle of the crowd, where one can easily step on them and then ask for money for compensation, they are not usually aggressive, but only slightly insistent.
Even in that case, it is better to completely ignore the people and go away pretending not to hear them.

- In Naples, as stated in the initial point, there are people dressed as Pulcinella or Neapolitan horn sellers, the former offer you a photo with them and then expect to be paid, a bit like those who are dressed as Gladiators at the Colosseum. For the latter, sellers of bracelets, horns, handkerchiefs or various knick-knacks, the approach is sometimes simply like ""Hey guys, can I ask you a favor?"" Never answer, ignore them and carry on, their goal is only to make you buy something and extort money.

- Finally, always be careful around tourist sites of those who offer to give you directions to take a photo or give you suggestions on how to do it, it is never free and always paid.

For taxis: always make sure the taximeter is on, never negotiate the price first and find out about the official rates on the websites of the municipal administrations of the cities where you are, so you can point out to taxi drivers, in the event that they propose a certain price, that theirs is too high. If you intend to pay by card, always point this out to the taxi driver first, since some use the excuse of having a broken POS to evade taxes.
Furthermore, official taxis throughout Italy are white, the others are abusive and illegal.

To eat, avoid restaurants or bars in the most central tourist streets, they are usually only crowded with tourists, especially those with waiters outside inviting you to come in, you eat badly and spend a lot.
Try to go to eat outside the tourist areas, where Italians usually go.
If you really have to go to a tourist area, even for a coffee, always ask for the menu first, at least you know how much you will spend.

To visit operas, parks, museums and monuments, always book on the official websites of the opera or museum and never buy fake tickets or tours there from those who want to extort money from you to offer you a tour at the last minute by skipping the line, they are ripping you off on the price by probably making you pay double. 

For now this is all that comes to mind, for any other questions or doubts I remain at your disposal.",4,1742837367.0,Egypt,4,1.0,False

Last year, my partner, our dog, and I did a 3-month road trip through the Scandinavian countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. Absolutely stunning places. Amazing nature, cozy cabins, and some of the best campings we've ever stayed in.

But one thing kept happening over and over.

We kept bothering our Airbnb hosts for:  
‚Ä¢ Wi-Fi credentials  
‚Ä¢ House rules (especially in shared spaces)  
‚Ä¢ Local food and activity recommendations  
‚Ä¢ Info on how to use certain appliances (saunas, fireplaces, smart locks, even coffee machines üòÖ)

Some hosts had printed welcome books, but they were often outdated.  
Others used Google Docs or PDFs, which weren‚Äôt mobile-friendly and often got lost in our inbox.

It made us realize:

**There‚Äôs no dead-simple, guest-friendly way to centralize all this info and keep it updated.**

So after the trip, I built [Qardify](https://qardify.io).

It‚Äôs a simple tool for hosts to create a digital welcome guide for their property.

It‚Äôs basically a WYSIWYG editor where you can:  
‚Ä¢ Add Wi-Fi credentials  
‚Ä¢ House rules  
‚Ä¢ Check-out instructions  
‚Ä¢ Local tips with Google Maps links  
‚Ä¢ Appliance instructions, emergency info, and more

You just print and display a QR code in your place (on the wall, table, fridge) and guests scan it with their phone. No app, no login.

A short URL is also generated if you want to send it through the Airbnb chat.

The cool part? You can update the content anytime, and the QR code stays the same.

It‚Äôs free to try. No catch.  
I‚Äôd love your feedback, ideas, or even criticism.

I don't want to work 40 hours a week just to stay one mental breakdown away from homelessness on this floating rock in space. I want to enjoy the sunshine, good food, and learn to love and be happy.

I don't want to have to die in the wilderness alone just to experience freedom and escape the nihilistic monotony of every day life in this godforsaken society.

1jiw8ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jiw8ff/9_weeks/,9 Weeks!!,"Thank you guys so much to all those who documented your experiences with hopping off caffeine. 

I didn't really spend much time on Reddit until I found this page and it's helped me a lot over the last 9 weeks. 

If I didn't go through what I did, I would have had a difficult time believing that there was such thing as caffeine withdrawal past a few weeks MAYBE a month max... and I wish that were true!! But in my case it certainly was not. 

I will preface this by saying I discovered I was iron deficient during this time so that definitely must have had an impact on how I was feeling. My ferritin was low but not anemic.  I also got off socials as well (minus Reddit and YT)

I just want to encourage those who are past week three and are shocked that they are starting to feel worse?? Don't give up!! 

Started drinking coffee 14 years ago. Had an espresso machine and would have a cappuccino a day. With pretty heavy shots. Do not know the exact mg. Had a stove top old school italian espresso pot up until 2021 when I got a new nicer espresso machine and started having more than usual. I'd have two cappuccinos tops a day since then. In hindsight I now notice when I started drinking coffee I would experince anxiety but why I didn't connect the two, I have no idea. I just always thought I had to sleep more or adjust my diet or whatever. 

Last December I went off caffeine for a month and it sucked but I knew I'd get back on it. I felt deep down I shouldn't but I did. Eeeek. Flash forward to the following December I get the same feeling like I need to give caffeine up again. I found this thread and realized it's time!! I tapered for about 4ish days then  I read that Allen Carr book and quit the next day. 

So yeah, the first week was bad but I could handle the physical pain. Muscle pain, headaches, extreme fatigue, anxiety. Dreams! I'm already a vivid, every night dreamer, but these were some insane other dimensional dreams I was having. Sleeping pretty well. But my expectations were low and I was bracing myself for the worst.

Week two got a little better physically as far as headaches and muscle aches and all the expected withdrawal symptoms. I thought I had made it past the worst... I was wrong. By end of week two my thoughts felt like a pin ball in a pinball machine, bouncing back and fourth,  disorganized thoughts, absolutely could not have deep thoughts (something I actually noticied the last few years drinking caffeine but had no idea that was the cause but it made me feel so insecure bc I really value intelligence and articulation and I felt like I had a very difficult time expressing myself and learning-awful feeling). I looked up ADHD symptoms and it matched most of what was described. Made me very empathetic to ppl diagnosed with ADHD not brought on my phone use and caffeine use, etc. 

 Memory was awful. Was so anxious and sad. Absolutely lost ability to care about my goals and dreams (scary). I run every morning and I had to walk instead and some days couldn't go. Had to cut out weight training because I was EXHASTED during the day and the first few weeks did have to nap a lot. I felt awful about this by the way. I felt extremely lazy and was really really upset not having energy to do things with my life that lead me to where I want to go in life. It really humbled me and made me even more grateful for the gift of health and mental clarity and joy. 

Week 3-6 we're pretty brutal. If you're in those weeks please push through. Suffering can honestly be so good bc it forces you to confront things youve never had the opportunity to before. This time makes you feel extremely vulnerable but it's also necessary for growth. It's AWFUL while you're in it, you're dying to yourself but there is so much gold in the valley. Don't miss the opportunity of suffering to gather it!

Absolutely some of the worst lows, anhedonia, had to isolate, lack of energy, muscle aches. Waking up with that physical anxiety on your chest which is really one of my least favorite withdrawal symptoms. 

End of week three insonnia hit and I didn't struggle with this at all pre withdrawal. I still have insomnia yall. It's wild. 

I noticied a shift after week 6 which a lot of people I noticed report as well. I really consciously tried to not give myself a timeline based on other people's experince, to avoid making it a self fulfilling prophecy but sheeesh it's wild how similar so many peoples timelines are. 

I just hit week nine yesterday and the last week was the first time I had a couple days I woke up and didn't have that anxiety on my chest. 

My sleep is still very interrupted. Still really pushing through anhedonia but I remember at week six I saw the sun light through these palm trees and I took a picture and realized that was the first time in weeks something beautiful caught my eye. This was one of the most difficult things for me to go through. I truly had lost the ability to see beauty in the world. And even in people and myself. Felt a lot of guilt with this! A theme ahh!

Huge positives- definitely feel way more present with people. I noticied this early on probably week 3. I can actually remember things much better now. I felt like a terrible friend for years bc I just could not remember things about people I love no matter how much I tried. Verbal fluency is improving. My HAIR is not shedding and already looks fuller at the roots(YAY!) it was thinning like crazy and freaking me out. 

Btw before this ive eaten extremely clean for most of my life. Have incorporated fasting regularly into my life over the last few years and especially last 2. I have celiac and eat mostly plants and fish except now I'm incorporating red meat to increase iron. But diet is mostly fruit, veggies, kimchi, nuts, dates, and gluten free bread. Some dairy but pre withdrawal I barely had any dairy. Post withdrawal ate dairy which I believe helped boost dopamine. 

Running/cardio is key. That is the main thing that helps. The days I don't run I notice it big time. 40 min. Even if it's in intervals it helps so much. 

Fasting I found very difficult until recently. I did do a 48 hour around week 4 and a 36 hour this weekend which help a lot but found it very difficult because food gives you dopamine. So I didn't push myself too hard with it but I think I'm starting to get the strength to incorporate it regularly into my life again soon. It helps a lot. 

Also give yourself more grace than I gave myself! I wish I just allowed myself to rest without guilt instead of judging myself so much. 

Feeling sooooo much better these days. I slept a little more last night. Feeling a little less exhausted during the day. And more energy to do things I enjoy. I'm hoping that physical anxiety on the chest is permanently gone! I know there's more healing ahead which I'm excited about but also trusting the reality that life really does just have highs and lows. Lots of ups and downs. 

I really wanted to make this post for the ppl in the middle of it 3-6 weeks when you may have thought it would be better by now. It gets better! Keep going dont lost hope. And if you do lose hope, find someone who has hope for you and borrow theirs.

1jiw8dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/100thupvote/comments/1jiw8dm/t64_ssp_burrs_carriers/,T64 SSP burrs carriers,"Been looking for a good value variable rate grinder for espresso and filter. Considered the DF64V but stumbled upon this T64 grinder. Did a bit of research and saw a few reviews. Thought it was good value. 

When it arrived, I naively thought I could swap out stock burrs with MP SSP since they were both 64mm.
Turns out they need specific burr carriers for SSPs 

I've since contacted the supplier to see if they can source them (last weekend so still awaiting).

Doing some trusty googling ,I contacted a few other suppliers abroad in Singapore but for some reason they were very obtrusive.  Stating they only sell the carriers to people who purchased grinders from them and then when I asked if I could contact manufacturer directly, they brushed me off saying don't bother they only deal with us not you.( From a customer service POV , complete fail)

I'm still awaiting a response from the UK supplier (hopefully I get good news but not holding my breath) 
Somehow I'm regretting the choice of taking a chance on a non-mainstream grinder. Should've just got the df64v . :')

Two hours to help with anything you might need help with. Two hours of free labor or general assistance. Need help lifting heavy things? Cleaning or organizing a garage or space? Garden care? Tree pruning? Have you been putting off a task because it's just too much hassle? I am offering you 2 hours of FREE help. No catch, no hidden fees, no bait and switch. Two free hours of helping hands at your service. 

You may be asking yourself Why would someone do this? Because I can and because I care. What do I get out of this? The simple joy of helping out a neighbor, simple as that.

Pretty much all the things that you have been putting off for a while for whatever reason. Maybe you don't need help with anything, maybe you just need someone to grab a cup of coffee with, unplug, and chat for a while?

There you have it y'all. Feel free to send me a Message to claim your two (2) hours.

DO NOT USE THE REDDIT CHAT FUNCTION TO MASSAGE ME AS IT DOES NOT WORK FOR SOME REASON AND I WILL NOT RECEIVE YOUR MESSAGE. SEND DMs ONLY.

I¬†was¬†living¬†alone,¬†and¬†very lonely. Not¬†finding¬†any¬†luck¬†in¬†regular¬†dating¬†or even one¬†night¬†stands,¬†I¬†started¬†using¬†CraigsList¬†to¬†find¬†hookups.¬†I¬†connected¬†with¬†Sara¬†who was¬†in¬†a¬†nearby¬†city¬†and¬†claimed¬†to¬†be¬†homeless¬†and¬†looking¬†for ""help"".¬†I'd seen¬†tons¬†of¬†scams¬†like¬†this¬†(and¬†fallen¬†for¬†a¬†few) ,¬†where¬†a¬†personals¬†ad¬†was¬†really¬†just¬†a¬†step 1 of¬†a¬†larger¬†scheme¬†to¬†get some¬†fast¬†cash.

I¬†decided¬†to¬†play¬†along¬†a¬†little¬†and¬†we¬†chatted¬†for¬†a¬†day¬†or so. We were¬†connecting,¬†and¬†I¬†began¬†to¬†think¬†she¬†was¬†telling¬†the truth. Or¬†at¬†the very¬†least¬†a¬†very¬†consistent¬†storyteller. We¬†exchanged¬†pics,¬†and¬†she¬†was¬†reasonably¬†okay¬†looking, older¬†than¬†me by¬†about¬†30years, but not some¬†Bag¬†Lady¬†type person. Honestly not someone¬†I¬†would¬†have¬†otherwise¬†pursued - but for the¬†fact¬†that¬†**I¬†thought¬†if¬†I¬†gave¬†her¬†a¬†place¬†to¬†sleep, she'd be ""grateful""¬†and¬†let me¬†fuck¬†her.**

So, we¬†made¬†arrangements¬†for me¬†to¬†come meet¬†her¬†downtown¬†one¬†evening¬†and¬†we¬†had¬†coffee¬†in¬†a¬†diner. She¬†was¬†actually¬†sort of¬†kind¬†of cute¬†in¬†person. She¬†was¬†really¬†short, but very loud,¬†intelligent.... she¬†was¬†crafty,¬†and¬†showed me¬†pictures¬†of¬†a¬†bunch of stuff she'd¬†made¬†by¬†hand¬†like¬†knitting¬†and¬†doll house¬†furniture. She loved¬†sending¬†physical¬†letters¬†and¬†cards¬†in¬†the¬†mail. She loved¬†handwriting¬†and¬†calligraphy,¬†and¬†said¬†letters felt more¬†personal¬†than¬†texting¬†or¬†emails. But she¬†was¬†also¬†definitely¬†a¬†bit¬†weird.¬†I¬†remember she¬†had¬†some¬†really¬†strong¬†opinions¬†about¬†mundane¬†food¬†choices,¬†and¬†went off on some¬†bizarre¬†conspiracy¬†theory¬†tangents¬†with¬†next¬†to¬†no¬†prompting.¬†I¬†chalked¬†it¬†up¬†to¬†her¬†living¬†on the streets¬†and¬†thought¬†I¬†could¬†probably¬†manage¬†""a¬†little¬†weird""¬†if¬†it¬†meant¬†I¬†could get¬†what¬†I¬†wanted.

I¬†decided¬†to¬†roll the¬†dice¬†because¬†above¬†all¬†other¬†things,¬†I¬†was¬†incredibly¬†horny¬†and¬†desperate.¬†I¬†invited¬†her¬†back¬†to¬†my¬†apartment,¬†saying¬†she could¬†stay¬†with¬†me¬†a¬†few¬†days¬†if¬†she¬†wanted. She¬†didn't¬†hesitate¬†even¬†a¬†second. She only¬†had¬†2¬†small¬†bags¬†with¬†her, so we¬†grabbed¬†those¬†and¬†took¬†off¬†back¬†to¬†my¬†apartment.

To¬†be¬†absolutely¬†clear¬†again,¬†I¬†was¬†NOT¬†doing¬†this¬†to¬†be¬†a¬†good guy, or¬†because¬†I¬†cared¬†about¬†her.¬†At¬†no¬†point¬†did¬†I¬†ever¬†genuinely¬†want¬†to¬†help¬†this¬†woman, or¬†improve¬†her¬†life.¬†This¬†was¬†100%¬†in¬†the hopes of¬†getting¬†her¬†comfortable¬†enough¬†at¬†my¬†place¬†that¬†we'd hook up. Every¬†dollar¬†I¬†spent¬†in¬†gas¬†or coffee¬†was¬†mentally¬†calculated¬†as¬†a¬†cost of¬†getting¬†to¬†that¬†point. Every¬†kindness¬†and¬†word¬†I¬†said¬†that¬†first¬†night¬†was¬†part¬†of¬†a¬†larger¬†design.¬†At¬†the¬†time¬†I¬†think¬†I¬†was¬†even¬†trying¬†to¬†fool¬†myself¬†into¬†thinking¬†I¬†was¬†being¬†a¬†nice¬†guy, but now¬†years¬†later¬†I¬†can¬†see how¬†manipulative¬†it¬†all¬†was.

I¬†never¬†intended¬†to¬†physically¬†force¬†her¬†to¬†do¬†anything¬†she¬†didn't¬†want¬†to¬†do, but¬†I¬†was¬†most¬†definitely¬†trying¬†to¬†build¬†a¬†path¬†towards¬†us¬†fucking,¬†and¬†I¬†was¬†definitely¬†abusing¬†a¬†power¬†dynamic¬†by¬†trying¬†to¬†create¬†a¬†situation¬†where¬†she¬†was¬†(1)¬†at¬†my¬†place¬†with¬†no¬†convenient¬†means¬†to¬†leave¬†on¬†her¬†own¬†and¬†(2) felt¬†obligated¬†to¬†""repay""¬†my¬†generosity.

So we get¬†back¬†to¬†my¬†apartment,¬†and¬†I¬†let¬†her¬†shower, get¬†cleaned¬†up,¬†have¬†a¬†late¬†night¬†snack. We¬†watch¬†some tv¬†and¬†cuddle up on the couch,¬†and¬†she's just¬†incredibly¬†grateful¬†and¬†also¬†very¬†clingy. She would¬†sit¬†really¬†close,¬†and¬†at¬†one¬†point¬†asked¬†if¬†we could hold¬†hands.¬†Later¬†she broke down¬†a¬†little¬†and¬†cried¬†because¬†she¬†said¬†she'd not felt ""safe""¬†in¬†probably¬†8 months or so. She¬†had¬†been¬†either¬†staying¬†on the streets,¬†in¬†shelters,¬†cars, or¬†with¬†someone who¬†was¬†dangerous¬†because¬†she¬†had¬†no¬†other¬†options. She¬†thanked¬†me¬†repeatedly¬†for¬†being¬†kind¬†and¬†giving¬†her¬†a¬†chance.

Each¬†time,¬†I¬†told¬†her¬†it¬†was¬†no problem,¬†I¬†was¬†happy¬†to¬†do¬†it,¬†I¬†was¬†so¬†glad¬†I¬†could help, etc. But none of¬†that¬†was¬†true.¬†I¬†was¬†still¬†just¬†waiting¬†for the¬†right¬†time¬†to¬†see¬†if¬†I¬†could¬†pivot¬†into¬†something¬†physical. She¬†asked¬†how long she could¬†stay. We'd¬†already¬†discussed¬†this¬†before¬†I¬†agreed¬†to¬†let¬†her¬†come over,¬†and¬†I'd¬†told¬†her¬†just 3¬†days¬†(I¬†had¬†partial¬†custody¬†of¬†my¬†kids¬†at¬†this¬†time¬†and¬†could not let¬†her¬†be¬†there¬†while¬†the¬†kids¬†were¬†with¬†me).

She seemed¬†to¬†swing¬†wildly¬†back¬†and¬†forth between¬†sadness,¬†and¬†gratitude,¬†and¬†not¬†knowing¬†what¬†to¬†do next.¬†I¬†couldn't be sure¬†I¬†would succeed¬†if¬†I¬†made¬†a¬†move, so¬†I¬†left¬†it¬†alone.¬†As¬†the¬†night¬†wore on¬†I¬†told¬†her¬†I¬†needed¬†to¬†get¬†to¬†bed,¬†because¬†I¬†had¬†to¬†work¬†tomorrow,¬†and¬†she¬†said¬†""ok"" but just sort of¬†sat¬†and¬†waited¬†for me¬†to¬†do or¬†say¬†something¬†else.

I¬†walked¬†her¬†back¬†to¬†my¬†kids' room¬†and¬†told¬†her¬†she could sleep¬†in¬†here.¬†There¬†was¬†a¬†bunk bed¬†and¬†lots of¬†clean¬†linens¬†and¬†stuff¬†in¬†there,¬†and¬†""I¬†would be¬†right¬†down the¬†hall¬†if¬†she needed¬†anything¬†in¬†the¬†night.""¬†I¬†could tell she¬†was¬†really¬†surprised.¬†I¬†started¬†to¬†realize¬†that¬†I¬†was¬†not¬†being¬†smooth or clever,¬†and¬†that¬†she 100% expected¬†and¬†anticipated¬†me¬†wanting¬†her¬†to¬†come¬†to¬†my¬†bed.¬†And¬†I¬†know now¬†I¬†am¬†not the¬†first¬†or¬†last¬†guy¬†to¬†abuse¬†her¬†in¬†this¬†way,¬†and¬†I¬†think¬†vulnerable¬†people just sort of... get used¬†to¬†being¬†taken¬†advantage¬†of.

I¬†wanted¬†it¬†to¬†be¬†her¬†choice,¬†and¬†didn't¬†want¬†to¬†tell¬†her¬†or even suggest¬†to¬†her¬†to¬†come¬†to¬†my¬†room.¬†In¬†my¬†fucked¬†up¬†head¬†I¬†thought¬†that¬†still¬†made¬†me¬†somewhat¬†honorable? So¬†I¬†left¬†her¬†there¬†and¬†she slept¬†in¬†my¬†kids' bedroom room¬†all¬†night,¬†and¬†I¬†slept¬†in¬†mine.¬†I¬†waited¬†up¬†about 4 hours¬†hoping¬†she'd come down the¬†hall.¬†At¬†one¬†point¬†I¬†heard¬†her¬†get up¬†and¬†use the¬†hall¬†toilet,¬†and¬†I¬†got¬†excited¬†and¬†almost¬†immediately¬†rock¬†hard,¬†thinking¬†""This¬†is¬†it""¬†like¬†it¬†was¬†some¬†kind¬†of porno¬†intro¬†- but then she went¬†back¬†to¬†the¬†other¬†room.

We woke up the next¬†morning,¬†and¬†she¬†was¬†soooo¬†happy. She¬†said¬†it¬†was¬†the best¬†night's sleep she'd¬†had¬†in¬†a¬†very long¬†time. We¬†had¬†a¬†quick¬†breakfast¬†and¬†coffee¬†that¬†morning¬†before¬†I¬†left for work,¬†and¬†she¬†asked¬†if¬†I¬†could¬†give¬†her¬†some¬†cash¬†for the¬†day.¬†Alarm¬†bells were¬†ringing¬†in¬†my¬†head, but¬†my¬†dick¬†was¬†still¬†in¬†charge. She¬†claimed¬†she¬†wanted¬†to¬†walk¬†to¬†the¬†nearest¬†store¬†and¬†get some¬†cleaning¬†supplies¬†and¬†clean¬†my¬†apartment¬†as¬†a¬†thank¬†you for¬†letting¬†her¬†stay.¬†I¬†told¬†her¬†she¬†didn't need¬†to¬†do¬†that, or¬†repay¬†me¬†at¬†all, but she¬†really¬†wanted¬†to. So¬†I¬†gave¬†her¬†$10,000,¬†and¬†left¬†her¬†there¬†in¬†my¬†apartment¬†for the¬†day.¬†In¬†hindsight¬†it¬†was¬†an¬†insanely¬†stupid¬†thing¬†to¬†do,¬†I¬†could¬†have¬†been completely¬†cleaned¬†out¬†and¬†robbed by the¬†time¬†I¬†came¬†home. She could¬†have¬†invited¬†other¬†people over, gotten¬†high, or¬†trashed¬†the¬†place.

We texted¬†a¬†little¬†during¬†the¬†day, but¬†I¬†never knew for sure¬†what¬†I¬†was¬†going¬†to¬†come¬†back¬†to, so¬†I¬†was¬†getting¬†increasingly¬†anxious.¬†And¬†up¬†to¬†the¬†point¬†that¬†I¬†actually¬†walked¬†in,¬†I¬†was¬†still¬†half¬†expecting¬†her¬†to¬†be gone,¬†along¬†with¬†my¬†tv¬†and¬†anything¬†else of¬†value. But no - she¬†was¬†there,¬†and¬†had¬†done¬†exactly¬†what¬†she'd¬†said. She'd¬†walked¬†to¬†the¬†fuckin¬†Walmart¬†and¬†gotten¬†a¬†bunch of stuff,¬†cleaners¬†and¬†a¬†new mop¬†and¬†had¬†cleaned¬†my¬†whole¬†kitchen,¬†and¬†both¬†bathrooms,¬†vacuumed,¬†and¬†everything. When¬†I¬†got home, she¬†ran¬†up¬†to¬†me¬†and¬†hugged me¬†and¬†it¬†was¬†like¬†we'd been¬†living¬†together¬†for¬†a¬†long¬†time. She showed me¬†everything¬†she¬†cleaned,¬†and¬†playfully¬†reprimanded¬†me for not¬†having¬†better¬†supplies. She¬†asked¬†about¬†my¬†day,¬†and¬†how¬†I¬†was¬†doing,¬†and¬†we just¬†had¬†a¬†great¬†rhythm¬†and¬†a¬†lovely¬†evening.¬†I¬†remember she¬†asked¬†to¬†cook¬†and¬†I¬†said¬†sure, but¬†because¬†I¬†was¬†a¬†dumbass¬†single¬†guy¬†at¬†the¬†time,¬†I¬†didn't¬†have¬†much. She¬†made¬†some¬†kind¬†of¬†chicken¬†something¬†dish¬†from¬†what¬†she could¬†find¬†and¬†it¬†was¬†honestly pretty¬†terrible. But¬†I¬†smiled,¬†and¬†thanked¬†her,¬†and¬†told¬†her¬†it¬†was¬†great¬†because¬†it¬†was¬†a¬†sweet gesture,¬†and¬†also¬†because¬†everything¬†seemed¬†to¬†be¬†coming¬†together.

We cuddled¬†again¬†that¬†night¬†watching¬†a¬†movie,¬†and¬†this¬†time¬†she¬†started¬†to¬†get pretty bold. She would hug me¬†and¬†run¬†her¬†hands¬†under¬†my¬†shirt,¬†and¬†put¬†her¬†fingers¬†through¬†my¬†hair,¬†and¬†laid¬†her¬†head¬†on¬†my¬†shoulder,¬†and¬†touched¬†my¬†legs¬†a¬†lot.¬†I¬†just let¬†her¬†do¬†whatever¬†she¬†wanted.¬†I¬†gave¬†very¬†little¬†back, even though¬†I¬†was¬†so turned on.¬†I¬†wanted¬†to¬†do more, but¬†as¬†soon¬†as¬†""my¬†plan""¬†started¬†to¬†obviously¬†work,¬†I¬†began¬†to¬†feel¬†incredibly¬†guilty¬†and¬†like¬†a¬†complete¬†piece¬†of¬†shit¬†for¬†everything¬†I'd done up¬†to¬†that¬†point.

The¬†night¬†went on,¬†and¬†it¬†was¬†getting¬†late.¬†I¬†told¬†her¬†again¬†I¬†needed¬†to¬†get¬†to¬†bed¬†because¬†of work¬†in¬†the¬†morning.¬†As¬†we¬†walked¬†down the¬†hall,¬†I¬†started¬†to¬†tell¬†her¬†goodnight¬†at¬†other¬†room,¬†and¬†she just¬†asked¬†""Can¬†I¬†sleep¬†in¬†your bed¬†instead?""¬†and¬†I¬†said¬†""I¬†don't¬†want¬†you¬†to¬†feel¬†like¬†you¬†have¬†to¬†do¬†that"" (absolute¬†a¬†lie,¬†I¬†orchestrated¬†this¬†moment¬†to¬†make¬†her¬†feel¬†that¬†way¬†and¬†definitely¬†wanted¬†her¬†in¬†there). She¬†said¬†""No,¬†I¬†want¬†to.¬†This¬†bed¬†is¬†nice, but¬†I¬†want¬†to¬†be next¬†to¬†you¬†if¬†that's¬†okay.""

So we both went¬†to¬†my¬†room. Now¬†I¬†don't know¬†if¬†she'd¬†decided¬†to¬†come¬†in¬†there¬†during¬†the¬†day¬†besides¬†to¬†clean¬†the¬†adjoining¬†bathroom¬†or¬†if¬†she would¬†have¬†respected¬†my¬†privacy, but she¬†at¬†least¬†acted¬†surprised¬†because¬†my¬†bed's¬†way¬†nicer¬†than¬†the¬†kids' bunkbeds¬†obviously. She¬†stripped¬†down¬†immediately,¬†and¬†crawled¬†into¬†bed¬†naked. She¬†kind¬†of hopped¬†and¬†bounced¬†a¬†little,¬†laughing¬†like¬†a¬†kid¬†and¬†she looked so¬†happy¬†to¬†be¬†there.¬†I¬†stripped¬†down¬†too¬†and¬†really¬†enjoyed just¬†getting¬†to¬†see¬†her¬†whole body¬†at¬†last.

As¬†soon¬†as¬†the¬†lights¬†were down, she got¬†really¬†sexually¬†aggressive¬†right¬†away. She¬†crawled¬†on¬†top¬†of me,¬†and¬†we were¬†making¬†out¬†and¬†grinding¬†and¬†it¬†felt¬†incredible.¬†I¬†do remember though she¬†was¬†a¬†terrible¬†kisser. She¬†did¬†this¬†thing¬†where¬†she would¬†kind¬†of open¬†and¬†close¬†her¬†mouth¬†while¬†she¬†kissed,¬†like¬†she¬†was¬†chomping. But¬†this¬†was¬†what¬†I'd been¬†planning¬†for,¬†and¬†so we went for¬†it. We rolled¬†around¬†for¬†a¬†couple hours,¬†touched¬†and¬†kissed¬†each¬†other¬†everywhere,¬†and¬†fucked¬†10 times¬†that¬†night,¬†and¬†I¬†didn't even use¬†protection¬†because¬†I¬†was¬†so lost¬†in¬†it.¬†Incredibly¬†stupid¬†and¬†reckless.

The next¬†day,¬†it¬†was¬†like¬†something¬†had¬†completely¬†lifted¬†for me.¬†Call¬†it¬†post nut¬†clarity¬†I¬†guess, but¬†I'd gotten¬†what¬†I¬†wanted¬†out of¬†this¬†exchange, so¬†I¬†was¬†I¬†ready¬†to¬†move on.¬†And¬†I¬†started¬†to¬†think¬†more¬†and¬†more¬†about¬†how¬†dangerous¬†and¬†reckless¬†I'd been¬†in¬†this¬†whole¬†scenario.¬†That¬†next¬†morning¬†she¬†was¬†sort of¬†idly¬†talking¬†about¬†the weekend¬†coming¬†up.¬†I¬†reminded¬†her¬†that¬†I'd¬†told¬†her¬†she could only be¬†here¬†for 3¬†days.¬†I¬†could tell she¬†was¬†hoping¬†that¬†the¬†previous¬†night¬†might¬†have¬†changed¬†things, but¬†I¬†held¬†firm.¬†I¬†began¬†to¬†immediately¬†pull¬†away¬†emotionally,¬†because¬†I¬†didn't¬†want¬†to¬†be¬†manipulated¬†into¬†changing¬†my¬†mind.¬†I¬†got¬†a¬†bit¬†colder¬†to¬†her,¬†and¬†left for work¬†again¬†that¬†morning. The whole¬†way¬†there¬†I¬†was¬†cursing¬†my¬†stupidity¬†at¬†being¬†so cold. Not¬†because¬†I'd¬†obviously¬†hurt¬†her¬†feelings¬†but¬†because¬†now she¬†might¬†want¬†to¬†punish¬†me -¬†and¬†I'd just left¬†her¬†alone¬†again¬†at¬†my¬†place.

I¬†got¬†back¬†home¬†that¬†evening¬†and¬†everything¬†was¬†fine. She¬†had¬†gone¬†back¬†to¬†the¬†store¬†and¬†gotten some more food,¬†and¬†had¬†a¬†nicer¬†dinner¬†waiting¬†for me.¬†I¬†tried¬†to¬†be so¬†nice, but¬†was¬†in¬†such¬†a¬†shitty¬†mood on the¬†inside.¬†I¬†think¬†because¬†she¬†was¬†doing¬†everything¬†she could¬†think¬†of¬†to¬†show me how¬†nice¬†it¬†was¬†for¬†her¬†to¬†be¬†there,¬†to¬†be¬†grateful¬†-¬†and¬†all¬†I¬†could do¬†was¬†to¬†see¬†it¬†through the¬†same¬†lens¬†I'd used on¬†her¬†-¬†that¬†she¬†was¬†now¬†manipulating¬†me,¬†and¬†trying¬†to¬†get me¬†to¬†fall¬†for¬†her¬†so¬†that¬†I'd let¬†her¬†stay.¬†I¬†tried¬†not¬†to¬†let¬†it¬†show but¬†I¬†think¬†she could¬†definitely¬†pick¬†up on the¬†change¬†in¬†the¬†atmosphere.

I¬†said¬†a¬†few¬†times¬†that¬†night¬†about¬†how¬†I'd need¬†to¬†drop¬†her¬†off¬†at¬†some¬†point¬†the next¬†day¬†before¬†my¬†kids¬†came¬†over¬†either¬†before work, or¬†right¬†after¬†I¬†got¬†back.¬†Making¬†i¬†clear¬†the¬†plan¬†wasn't¬†going¬†to¬†change. By the end of the¬†evening, she'd¬†made¬†arrangements¬†for¬†a¬†friend¬†to¬†come¬†and¬†pick¬†her¬†up.¬†I¬†told¬†her¬†""you¬†can't let them¬†in¬†here, you know¬†that,¬†right?""¬†and¬†I¬†could tell¬†it¬†really¬†hurt¬†her¬†feelings. She¬†said¬†she¬†understood.

When¬†it¬†was¬†time¬†for bed, the mood¬†lifted¬†a¬†little,¬†and¬†we both got¬†playful¬†with¬†each¬†other¬†again. We both slept¬†in¬†my¬†room¬†again¬†that¬†night,¬†and¬†despite¬†how¬†I'd¬†acted, she¬†was¬†still¬†all¬†over me once the¬†lights¬†went off. We¬†fucked¬†again,¬†and¬†cuddled for¬†a¬†little¬†while¬†after.¬†I¬†remember¬†thinking¬†in¬†the¬†dark,¬†while¬†her¬†head¬†was¬†on¬†my¬†chest¬†and¬†I¬†was¬†playing¬†with¬†her¬†hair.¬†I¬†imagined¬†what¬†my¬†life¬†might¬†be¬†like¬†if¬†I¬†decided¬†to¬†treat¬†this¬†woman¬†like¬†an¬†actual¬†person,¬†and¬†to¬†not just use¬†and¬†discard¬†her. But then¬†I¬†tried¬†to¬†imagine¬†how¬†I'd¬†explain¬†her¬†to¬†other¬†people, or¬†what¬†my¬†friends¬†would¬†think¬†of¬†her.¬†Someday¬†it¬†might¬†come out¬†what¬†I'd done,¬†and¬†someone else would see through¬†my¬†bullshit¬†and¬†realize¬†I'd¬†manipulated¬†her. So¬†I¬†started¬†to¬†focus on¬†everything¬†she'd done¬†that¬†I¬†didn't¬†like,¬†like¬†the¬†bad¬†food,¬†and¬†the¬†terrible¬†kissing, the¬†weird¬†conspiracy¬†stuff¬†and¬†I¬†just closed¬†my¬†mind¬†to¬†anything¬†else.¬†I'd done¬†something¬†reckless, but¬†made¬†it¬†out¬†with¬†my¬†kidneys¬†intact¬†and¬†shouldn't try¬†to¬†push¬†my¬†luck¬†any¬†further.

The next¬†morning,¬†I¬†was¬†feeling¬†terrible, but wouldn't budge on¬†her¬†having¬†to¬†leave.¬†I¬†never even¬†asked¬†her¬†where¬†she would¬†actually¬†go, or who the¬†friend¬†was¬†that¬†was¬†picking¬†her¬†up.¬†All¬†that¬†mattered¬†was¬†that¬†she'd be gone by the¬†time¬†I¬†came¬†back¬†from work. She¬†asked¬†to¬†keep¬†in¬†touch,¬†and¬†for¬†a¬†way¬†to¬†send me¬†a¬†letter so¬†I¬†gave¬†her¬†my¬†PO box.

She texted me¬†during¬†the¬†day¬†to¬†tell me she got off¬†safely¬†and¬†sure enough, she¬†was¬†gone by the¬†time¬†I¬†got home. She left the¬†place¬†in¬†great¬†condition,¬†and¬†even¬†made¬†the beds.¬†I¬†remember¬†because¬†my¬†kids¬†were¬†like¬†""Dad, why¬†did¬†you do¬†that?!""¬†because¬†I¬†have¬†never once¬†made¬†theirs¬†for them. We¬†chatted¬†via¬†text for¬†a¬†little¬†while¬†longer,¬†I¬†want¬†to¬†say¬†maybe¬†a¬†few weeks¬†at¬†most. Just very¬†superficial, ""Hey, how¬†are¬†you, hope¬†things¬†are¬†good"" type texts. She¬†had¬†gone¬†back¬†to¬†the¬†city,¬†where¬†there¬†were more resources for¬†her,¬†and¬†had¬†hopes for¬†a¬†job¬†lead.¬†I¬†just¬†gradually¬†stopped¬†replying¬†much¬†and¬†then¬†at¬†some¬†point¬†she never texted¬†again.

I¬†am¬†telling¬†this¬†story¬†now,¬†in¬†all¬†its¬†detail,¬†because¬†**I¬†was¬†and¬†am¬†a¬†complete¬†piece¬†of¬†shit**.¬†I¬†took¬†advantage¬†of¬†this¬†vulnerable¬†woman¬†for¬†my¬†own¬†gain.¬†Everything¬†I¬†did,¬†everything¬†I¬†said, every¬†act¬†of¬†generosity¬†was¬†done so¬†that¬†I¬†could¬†fuck¬†her.¬†I¬†didn't¬†actually¬†care¬†about¬†her, or¬†her¬†situation, or¬†what¬†happened¬†to¬†her¬†when¬†I¬†was¬†done. She¬†was¬†just someone who¬†I¬†could¬†fuck.¬†I¬†didn't¬†rape¬†her¬†by the¬†technical¬†definition¬†but¬†I¬†definitely¬†coerced¬†her,¬†and¬†manipulated¬†her.¬†I¬†tried¬†to¬†justify¬†it¬†in¬†my¬†head¬†by¬†saying¬†that¬†these were¬†her¬†own¬†choices. But¬†I¬†told¬†her¬†lies¬†that¬†I¬†thought she'd¬†want¬†to¬†hear.¬†And¬†I¬†intentionally¬†created¬†a¬†situation¬†where¬†she would¬†have¬†those¬†choices¬†to¬†make.

I knew she would be there but I didn‚Äôt expect her to come up to me and say ‚Äúhi‚Äù like nothing had happened. I saw her and ignored her and people around me noticed this weird interaction.

For context, she was my best friend and soul sister. I really cared for and loved her and we had a great vibe. Years passed, she visited my ex in another country. This ex was a mutual friend. In the beginning, we both had a crush on him. Eventually he fell in love with me and after a few years, we got into a relationship. We had broken up a year before her visit.

She not only hid the fact that she was planning to stay at his house during her trip, but she also spun all kinds of false stories about me- claiming that I had cheated on him and feeding him other hurtful lies. I don‚Äôt know what else happened but by the end of the trip, my ex and she had slept together and eventually started a relationship. In hindsight I think she always carried that vengeance that the guy chose me over her in the beginning and she wanted that petty satisfaction for her ego idk. 

When she returned from the trip, she met with me and told me everything, juicy details of their intimate time and their feelings for each other. At the end, she said she was now in a relationship with him and expected me to be happy for her. Even though I had moved on, the whole situation didn‚Äôt sit well with me. I tried to stay composed during our coffee meet-up, but once I got home, I started spiraling and sent her a message. I told her that what she did was an AH move and that I was ending our friendship. She was apologetic for less than five minutes before turning snarky. We ended up blocking each other on everything and never spoke again.

Fast forward three years, and at this wedding, she comes up to me all bubbly and sweet, acting like nothing happened. I ignored her and I‚Äôm glad that I did but I‚Äôm still fuming at her audacity. I never got a decent apology from her till date, idk how she expected me to be nice to her. 

P.S- I did talk to my ex once after this incident to know the story from his side and he spoke to me like I‚Äôm some kinda monster (idk to what extent she made up stories about me) and he told me bluntly that it was out of spite and he did it to hurt me and that he had no feelings for her other than that.

I made/painted/stained or somehow altered most everything in it and designed it as I went along (with a lot of lessons learned). The little newspaper is printed with the headline of the pandemic, and the library features pictures of my mom and daughter, Scrabble (which my mom and I loved playing), and other tributes. I tried to do as much as I could by hand. I made the coffered ceiling with coffee stir sticks and cardboard and I also made the wainscoting with cardboard.

We work in the same building, but not the same department. I was intrigued by her from the first time I saw her. We engaged in small talk for a few months before I finally asked her out for coffee.

The date *seemed* to go well. At the end, I went in for a kiss which she fully reciprocated and we actually ended up making out for a couple minutes. After that she said we should really do it again sometime, to which I said yeah I think that‚Äôs a good idea.

I reached out a couple days later asking if she wanted to grab drinks again the following weekend. She said she was ‚Äúbusy‚Äù and didn‚Äôt offer an alternative time. Immediately I knew something was up since she didn‚Äôt offer an alternative. I gave the situation some room to breathe and reached out a week later asking again, to which she gave the same response with no alternative. I took the hint and stopped bothering her.

So for the last year and a half I‚Äôve had to see her at least once a week in passing. I‚Äôm always professional. I just say ‚Äúsup‚Äù or give her a nod and keep walking. I don‚Äôt try to drag her into conversation and I‚Äôve certainly never asked her why she stopped talking to me.

I found out last week she found a new job and is leaving soon. Part of me is ecstatic because I‚Äôm tired of seeing her, but part of me is sad because now it means I really have to move on. I guess a part of me always hoped she would reach out at some point, which she never did. I‚Äôll be honest, I really liked her. I know it was only one date, but we can‚Äôt help when we catch feelings. I‚Äôve gone out with other women since then but it hasn‚Äôt helped.

Now it feels like my whole workplace is tainted. Even once she‚Äôs gone, the memory of her is going to linger around this place big time. I started suffering from insomnia after this incident first happened. It hasn‚Äôt been persistent, but there have been several weeks since then where I only sleep 2-3 hours per night. I dread going into work because of her presence.

The thing is, this is such a great career opportunity. I‚Äôve been here 3 years and it‚Äôs the first job I got since embarking on a new career path 5 years ago. Not to mention the job market is terrible right now (I work in tech). 

I‚Äôm really at a loss for what to do. I like my boss and my coworkers, but being here depresses me after all that‚Äôs happened. It‚Äôs been a year and a half and the pain still feels fresh, though maybe that‚Äôs only because I‚Äôve had to endure seeing her all the time. It‚Äôs concerning to me that the pain is still so strong. I feel so pathetic that I can‚Äôt seem to move on. Meanwhile, she‚Äôs not thinking about me at all.

We used to ""date"" in high school when we were like 15. By that I mean we used to go for walks and hold hands. Nothing more than that. Long story short I ran into him a few months ago and he asked me for coffee a few months ago. I agreed and we went on a couple of dates, and I was genuinely having a good time. Fast forward to Valentine's Day, he comes over with a gift for me, and a card that professed his love, and that he was always in love with me. I brushed it off as love bombing, and this is my bad and I know this next part makes me the asshole but we slept together. The next day I texted him and told him I was not looking for a serious relationship, but I was fine hanging out. As the card was hitting me and really freaking me out. He agreed but then continued to bring me gifts (flowers on my birthday) and show up at my house uninvited.
Due to that I stopped hanging out with him, but he still didn't get the message. Last night I sent him a message saying I didn't want to hang out anymore.
He showed up at my door and aggressively banged on my door for about 20 minutes. Calling and texting saying he wanted to talk. My brother was also home at the time, I was hiding in the basement.
Brother said he saw him tried and shake the door handle to enter the house. I'm terrified, and don't know what to do next. I'm worried for his wellbeina but also mine. I just wanted to see if anyone has advice, or has been in a similar situation.

Today I won't be posting some long-winded, unhinged motivational post. 

Y'all know what day it is. You don't need me to tell you to get out there and enjoy this awesome city. You don't need me to remind you to keep your head up, you don't need some guy named Vic telling you what you already know, right? 

No, instead I'm gonna keep it short and sweet.

To celebrate the start of my favorite season I am going to give away 2 hours to anyone who needs them. Two hours to help with anything you might need help with. Two hours of free labor or general assistance. Need help lifting heavy things? Cleaning or organizing a garage or space? Garden care? Tree pruning? Have you been putting off a task because it's just too much hassle? I am offering you 2 hours of FREE help. No catch, no hidden fees, no bait and switch. Two free hours of helping hands at your service. 

You may be asking yourself Why would someone do this? Because I can and because I care. What do I get out of this? The simple joy of helping out a neighbor, simple as that.

Here are things I can offer help with. 

-Garage and storage organizing and cleaning. 

-Household cleaning and general chores. 

-Moving/lifting heavy things. 

-General garden care and tree maintenance. 

-Window washing. 

-Small repairs and fixes. 

-General errands and chores. 

-Spring Cleaning!

Pretty much all the things that you have been putting off for a while for whatever reason. Maybe you don't need help with anything, maybe you just need someone to grab a cup of coffee with, unplug, and chat for a while?

There you have it y'all. Feel free to send me a Message to claim your two (2) hours.

DO NOT USE THE REDDIT CHAT FUNCTION TO MASSAGE ME AS IT DOES NOT WORK FOR SOME REASON AND I WILL NOT RECEIVE YOUR MESSAGE. SEND DMs ONLY.

That's it!

Tucked into the heart of the Western Ghats, Karnataka, Coorg (Kodagu) is a paradise draped in lush flora and fauna. Every inch of this place is a mysterious blend of serenity, culture, and nature‚Äôs finest work. It‚Äôs a destination that awakens all the senses.


*The Environment*

Slightly warm and tropical by day, refreshingly cool by evening, Coorg is an oxygen-rich sanctuary with a crisp, cool breeze flowing throughout. The air carries a natural perfume‚Äîa fusion of jasmine, coffee blossoms, jackfruit, and a medley of wildflowers. Every turn reveals a new fragrance, a new landscape, and a new way to appreciate nature.

The streets are lined with towering old trees wrapped in pepper vines, their canopies forming tunnels of green. This isn‚Äôt just a place you visit‚Äîit‚Äôs a place you feel.

*The Culture*

The Kodava people take immense pride in their traditions, shaped by a unique mix of indigenous customs and British colonial influence. Known for their warrior spirit, hospitality, and humility, the locals here are hardworking and down-to-earth despite their immense wealth. Every interaction leaves you with warmth and a story to take back home.


*The Food*

Coming from a bustling city like Bangalore, I expected familiar flavors‚Äîbut Coorg‚Äôs cuisine is a world of its own.

From homely eateries to hidden gems, the aroma of Pandi Curry (pork curry) and Akki Roti fills the air. You‚Äôll find steaming plates of Sambal (steamed rice balls) and rich, spiced chicken curries at almost every turn. Every 100-200 feet, there‚Äôs a local bar waiting to serve you your drink of choice, enhancing the experience with the region‚Äôs warm, laid-back vibe.

*For Bikers ‚Äì A Dream Ride*

If you‚Äôre a biker, Coorg is the road trip destination of your dreams. Why?

-Silky smooth asphalt spanning 40-50 feet wide.

-ZERO bumps‚Äîseriously, none.

-Scenic mountain roads weaving through the lush green coffee estates, misty ghats, and cascading waterfalls.

-Twisties galore‚Äîsteep inclines, tight curves, thrilling descents, and long, open stretches.

-You can comfortably cruise at 70-100 kmph without a worry. I rode my Speed 400, which usually gives 26-27 kmpl in Bangalore city, but on these flawless roads, I got a staggering 32 kmpl!


*Conclusion*

If you want to experience life in its purest, most exhilarating form‚Äîtake a bike trip to Coorg.
It‚Äôs not just a destination; it‚Äôs an experience you‚Äôll never forget.

That‚Äôs the Principle of Vibration messing with you.  Everything is in constant motion‚Äîyour thoughts, your emotions, your Wi-Fi signal... Except, of course, when you're trying to get your life together and the universe suddenly goes silent.

Here‚Äôs where it gets fun.  The Law of Rhythm?  Yeah, it‚Äôs like riding a rollercoaster‚Äîexcept sometimes it‚Äôs the one in the horror movies.  You‚Äôre up, you‚Äôre down, and you‚Äôre screaming the whole way.  But guess what?  You‚Äôre still strapped in.  You‚Äôve got the power to decide when to scream and when to enjoy the ride... if you can manage to stop panicking long enough.

Everything‚Äôs a game of opposites...like when your boss gives you a compliment and you still feel like you‚Äôre two seconds away from a meltdown. Hot and cold? They‚Äôre just like your mood swings after coffee.  Get used to it.

So when life hands you lemons, maybe it‚Äôs time to question why it keeps doing that.  Or maybe it‚Äôs time to embrace the chaos, squeeze those lemons into something darkly delicious, and just vibe...until the next existential crisis hits.

Like the title states, I am trying to decide how to restore the top portion of a Henredon Ming Pagoda Coffee Table I picked up yesterday. My plan is to use it as the living room's coffee table. The top has an Ash Burl veneer. I'd like to get the veneer to pop a bit more but am also worried about some of the spots where the veneer has been worn through and damaging them further (picture 3).

For my restoration plan I would start with an application of mineral spirits to clean and lightly strip as the existing finish itself looks pretty worn down already. I don't want to further damage the already damaged burl veneer. Then I'd spend a few hours french polishing the top. Does this sound like a good way to go about restoring the top?

Any advice or tips are much appreciated. Thank you

1jivyoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1jivyoe/hearing_loss_in_the_left_ear_and_distortion/,hearing loss in the left ear and distortion,"Hi, my name is Serge, I‚Äôm 33 years old. I wrote here a while ago, and I want to summarize how I‚Äôm doing and how my problems have evolved.

My first ear infection (otitis) happened in 2007, with a 30% hearing loss in my left ear. It partially recovered, but I‚Äôd say it was my first auditory damage.

In June 2012, during my second year of university (age 20), I had a second ear infection, losing 50% of my left ear‚Äôs hearing. I think it somewhat recovered because I felt I could hear better after healing. This infection left me with tinnitus in both ears, which took until mid-2013 to lessen in intensity.

I dropped out of university because stress worsened my tinnitus and the noise made it hard to focus. I started working part-time and continued living with my parents. Over the years, my left ear developed auditory fatigue, which only happened after long music sessions. I didn‚Äôt listen to loud music‚ÄîI‚Äôd become aware of tinnitus risks and joined support groups, though I didn‚Äôt research deeply. I just knew to avoid loud noises and stress. So, I bought good headphones (around $150 at the time) and listened at 50-60 dB. Sometimes I might‚Äôve gone over, but auditory fatigue was my limit. I tried lowering the volume to 40-50 dB, and after 2017, the fatigue disappeared. My tinnitus only flared up with stress or loud noises, which I avoided.

Between 2012 and 2020, my right ear compensated for my left ear‚Äôs hearing loss. Note: A 2017 audiometry test (20 Hz to 16,000 Hz) showed my left ear had an 8 dB difference up to 10,000 Hz and 14 dB beyond that. Yet, in online tone tests, I could hear up to 17,100 Hz (left) and 17,500 Hz (right).

After that, I did yearly home tests because my left ear often felt clogged. I went to the ER thinking it was otitis, but they found nothing. It turned out to be jaw inflammation from a misaligned wisdom tooth. I ignored it, and years passed without significant hearing loss. In 2023, my last test showed I could hear up to 16,800 Hz (left) and 17,000 Hz (right).

The clogging episodes continued every 3 months (no tinnitus) until early 2024. The inflammation was internal until one day, my left ear made a¬†*crack*¬†sound‚Äîa dry noise. It was my jaw joint dislocating due to the misalignment. In 2024, inflammation became intermittent (every 2 months). I had episodes in February, April (from acid reflux), and May (infection).

Then came the worst: a loud door slammed in my face during an argument with my brother. My left ear had severe tinnitus for a month before easing. In July, an ENT cleaned my ears (excessive wax), and the tinnitus reduced to a moderate level. It stayed that way until August.

After the door slam, another test showed I could hear up to 16,100 Hz (left) and 16,400 Hz (right). I may have lost hearing from that incident, as 7 months prior, I could hear up to 16,800 Hz and 17,000 Hz, respectively.

In August 2024, I had a strange pulsatile tinnitus in both ears, synced with my heartbeat. I couldn‚Äôt sleep well. By September, my physiotherapist noted left facial inflammation (from the wisdom tooth). My extraction was scheduled for October, but after exercising, the inflammation subsided, and the pulsatile tinnitus vanished.

On September 15, after drinking coffee (bad idea), I had a loud ringing in both ears‚Äîso intense I couldn‚Äôt hear anything for 2 minutes. My hearing returned, and the tinnitus faded. I didn‚Äôt pay it much attention afterward.

  
Everything continued normally until, almost a week later, while cleaning my room, I noticed that plastic bags sounded strange. Music began to sound distorted, and I developed¬†**auditory sensitivity**. My tinnitus intensified, and new tones appeared.

I went to the ER and was prescribed¬†**lorazepam**¬†to sleep. It helped, reducing the distortions to the point where I only barely noticed them in white noise. I had my wisdom tooth and another infected molar extracted, which relieved my chronic jaw inflammation. I‚Äôd never connected my dental issues to my ear, but after the extractions, my ear rarely became inflamed or clogged (and when it did, it lasted only a day). I stopped taking¬†**ibuprofen**¬†for inflammation.

The distortions improved, but the new tones and sensitivity persisted. By late¬†**October 2024**, the sensitivity vanished, but the distortions worsened: they weren‚Äôt just in bags or music anymore‚ÄîI heard them in water, wind, and even began perceiving¬†**Morse code in people‚Äôs voices**¬†and a¬†**robotic tone in women‚Äôs voices**.

In¬†**November**, another audiometry test revealed the cause of my¬†**dysacusis**¬†(distortions):

* **Peak at 3000 Hz.**
* **Dip at 4000‚Äì5000 Hz.**
* **Normal range from 5000 to 6000 Hz.**
* **Sharp fluctuations between 8000 and 12,000 Hz.** I also noticed my left ear heard up to¬†**15,800 Hz**, while my right ear only reached¬†**15,400 Hz**¬†(suggesting more hearing loss in the right). Though the loss was minor, both ears heard at the¬†**same dB level**¬†without obvious differences.

The ENT and audiologist couldn‚Äôt help, so I saw a psychiatrist in¬†**December 2024**. They prescribed¬†**more lorazepam and risperidone**. By year‚Äôs end, the Morse code and some distortions had disappeared.

In¬†**January 2025**, I returned to work without hyperacusis but with multiple tinnitus tones and mild dysacusis. Outdoors, the dysacusis lessened, and my tinnitus was barely noticeable. This continued until¬†**March 2025**, when a new test showed:

* **Left ear:**¬†**5‚Äì10 dB difference every 1000 Hz**, with a cutoff at¬†**10,000 Hz**¬†(a sudden loss from 10,000‚Äì15,000 Hz!).
* **Right ear:**¬†Up to¬†**14,200 Hz**¬†(also diminished).

This deeply worried me. I don‚Äôt struggle with daily hearing, but my left ear now makes voices sound like a¬†**poorly tuned radio**. I haven‚Äôt been exposed to loud noises‚Äîjust work.

I have an ENT appointment in April, but I‚Äôm anxious about this¬†**sudden left-ear hearing loss**¬†(and slight right-ear decline). I don‚Äôt know what to do.",2,1742836294.0,tinnitus,1,1.0,False
1jivygw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1jivygw/alkemia_dark_academe_review/,Alkemia Dark Academe Review,"Welcome back to my weekly installment of Alkemia reviews until I eventually finish all my sample packs! Is everybody ready for part 3? [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/s/a5oZItSU3i) wasn't very successful, [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/s/Jl8yuozhSz) was a significant, marked improvement (with a find of maybe my new all-time favorite scent?) - so I'm definitely excited to jump into this week. 

My preferences: I enjoy incense, smoke, red fruits, sandalwood, dirt, and complex, layered fragrances-leaning dark or spooky. I also like petrichor, green scents, fruity florals, wisteria, purple florals and atmospherics. I don't like anise, cinnamon, strong lemon, dark booze, overly sweet gourmands, medicinal scents, laundry scents, or anything distinctly masculine. My skin chemistry tends to make things turn sweet - the sweetness is more dry like a marshmallow than syrupy or a sugary candy.   

My top 3 favorite indies from my top 3 favorite houses: **Amorphous/Black Baccara** - *Sanguenta*, *Mother Medusa*, *Frog's Breath*; **Nui Cobalt Designs** - *Kitsune*, *Banshee*, *Gargoyle*; **Solstice Scents** - *Cliffside Bonfire*, *Victorian Picnic*, *Smoky Mountain Mallow*

Rating scale:
1: I hate it so much, I've considered removing my arm from my body because scrubbing it off isn't enough.
 
2: I'm on the fence, leaning toward dislike - but willing to expiriment. 

3: Neutral, platonic like. Not enough to FS, but will definitely finish. 

4: Instant love - will strongly consider FS. 

5: Over the moon, inspiring obsession - holy grail status. Immediately FS. 

ü™µü•É**Academy of Pleasure** - *An indecent proposal of red and golden ambers infused with a bottle of fine cognac liqueur, a suede waistcoat hurriedly abandoned on an antique chair, a haphazard tangle of bergamot scented linen sheets, cardamon-hashish coffee, and a cedar lined cigar humidor.*

Wet on my skin: smoky suede and bergamot - insanely strong bergamot - and cognac. 

Drydown: We are fully inside a glass of cognac. Bergamot linens flutter across a traditionally masculine cedar, and the cognac ebbs and flows, as if you are pouring and drinking and pouring again. Not in a way where you are drowning your sorrows alone, but more so like sharing a tipple with a friend at an idealized, old-timey gentleman's social club; the scent of cardamon-hashish coffee brewing in the background. Surprisingly clean. 

After 30 minutes: the cognac bottle has all but emptied, but the ambers have stayed gently - adding warmth to well-worn suede. I'm also getting a little of the cardamom coffee, as if they were filled in tiny espresso cups. Maybe there's a hint of tobacco lingering in the air, like a cigar that's not been smoked. 

Fades out to a well-blended cedar and amber, has a light-medium throw and lasts on my skin for, like, 3 hours? Weirdly short. 

My rating: Spring; golden-brown Topaz; a distinguished, but not pretentious gentleman, like Mr. Darcy of *Pride and Prejudice* after he's fallen for Elizabeth; 2/5 - I did find this pleasant, but it was ultimately too masculine for my personal taste. It's not one I'd give to my husband either, as he has an alcohol allergy - while I don't believe this is made with alcohol I doubt he'd enjoy smelling like the thing that makes him sick. That being said, encountering this in the wild would be a delight and I can definitely see the appeal! 

Edit - my husband, who would not listen when I told him trying this would be a bad idea, ended up trying it anyway. He wanted to know what cognac would smell like free from alcohol, but as soon as it developed he became rather queasy. The true epitome of 'curiosity killed the cat'. His first scrubber. 

‚òïü••**As Dark Things Are Meant to be Loved** - *Lapsang souchong tea, aloeswood, smoked black amber, aged dark patchouli, tonka, Amazonian breuzinho, Moroccan bhakoor, labdanum, temple incense, caramelized opium, black coffee, black coconut, soft Russian leather, and tabac leaf.*

Wet on my skin: patchouli that's almost kind of menthol-y but in a pitch earth way - and coconut husks? 

Drydown: the bakhkoor has pushed the mentholated patch out to the background and Lapsang has sauntered to its place. It's flirtatious with what I can only imagine to be opium (not familiar with the note, but it smells heady - very faintly of poppies drowned in resin?) 

After 30 minutes: Black amber and labdanum, thick and sweet like caramel ooze, sharpened with piney Brazilian frankincense. The ghost of coffee hits my nose on the way out, but I can't tell if that's wishful thinking or not. It's reminding me of a blended up caramel coffee drink that's all syrups and spices with no perceptable coffee taste, but it's inside a Metaphysical shop that is perpetually burning incense. You can almost smell the drink, but the resins are just so much stronger - which is not a bad thing. 

Fades out to that caramel coffee drink and honeyed tobacco, has a light throw, and lasts on my skin for 10 hours. 

My rating: Fall; Chestnut brown; cozy in a way that feels a bit challenging - like a Jess Mariano type from *Gilmore Girls*; 3.5/5 - I see why this is a darling of the Dark Academia crowd and on IMAM. Personally, I'd like to smell this on a man, but I'm not saying the scent is masculine! It's quite gourmand, but in a way that I think would be fitting on a hot guy in a romance novel - he's your intellectual rival with biting wit that plays the violin and feeds stray cats on his way home from the campus library. It's the kind of smell where you can't tell if it's his cologne or the lingering smell of the last woman he came into contact with. I'm probably going to destash to my husband. 

üí®üßπ**Dustsceawung** - *An olfactory meditation on dust... attic air, the inside of old trunks, library stacks & abandoned buildings*

Wet on my skin: stale air in a room coated in a thin layer of dust. 

Drydown: a light bulb being coated in a cloud of dust. It's almost spicy (like a dried herb/spice mixed with hay?), but it's definitely dust. Ever been in an antique shop that's kind of empty? Lots of knickknacks and trinkets arranged haphazardly on shelves, their shapes outlined in dust on the shelf, books on books on books softly rotting, pages yellowed - now imagine it romanticized through the lense of a perfume. 

After 30 minutes: it's crazy to say that this dust scent also smells fresh, but it does. It's dust and cold midnight air, almost wet with moss and fog. 

Fades out to a sweet herbal dust, has a light-medium throw and lasts on my skin for 8 hours.

My rating: Spring (or Fall); Gray-asparagus;  Mothman perusing through their favorite antique shop during the early morning when only mostly-blind Myrtle is working - she can't quite make out the cryptid who reminds her of her grandson and Mothman enjoys the prattling of the sweet old woman's crocheting needles and the updates on the local gossip; 4.5/5 - this is maybe the most gender neutral, truly green scent I've ever experienced. So often I experience green scents that are straight up masc or have been made more femme with florals or fruit, but this one truly hits the bullseye of genderfree and green. It's also a little spooky and atmospheric, which I think is rare for a scent I'd choose to wear in spring. I wouldn't call it photorealistic because it's definitely a perfume interpretation of dust - but I wouldn't want it to be. 

üåºüìö**Old Books and Fresh Flowers** - *Fresh neroli orange flowers and heliotrope blossoms pressed between the delicate paper pages of a leather-bound book*

Wet on my skin: orange flowers and paper 

Drydown: heliotrope that leans marzipan and leather with just a hint of orange blossoms peeking through 

After 30 minutes: Smoky leather at the forefront followed by creamy heliotrope and just a breath of vanilla paper - but it still feels light and fresh. Normally I'd associate leather with fall or winter because of how heavy it tend to be - but the blooms here really lighten the overall impression. 

Fades out to heliotrope and orange blossoms shadowed by time-softened leather, has a light throw and lasts on my skin for 5 hours. 

My rating: Spring/Summer Transition; wholemeal honey (a dark, raw sienna); spending a warm afternoon in the gardens of a fantasy boarding school leafing through old tomes; 3/5 - I can see this for a person with a Cottagecore aesthetic or for a Hobbit living peacefully in the shire (both Samwise and Rosie Cotton) - it's very happy and serene, but it's just not me. 

‚è≥ü´ñ**Persian Tearoom** - *Spiced black tea, dry desert sand, and Silk Road spices infused with the sensual promise of enticing musk and a flirtatious kiss of soft leather.*

Wet on my skin: very realistic desert sand, spices (cardamom?) and leather. I live in the desert and we literally just had a sandstorm bad enough that we lost power a few days ago - this reminds me of that, catching in a leather jacket. 

Drydown: Musky spices (ginger and clove?) and a hint of black tea in the middle of a sandstorm, but maybe you're inside now so the sand smell isn't *quite* as strong. 

After 30 minutes: an almost sweet, black jasmine tea and pockets brimming with sand. WHY WON'T THE SAND DIE - FREE ME FROM THESE HOT GRAINS OF ETERNAL MISERY. I like the other things this scent is doing, but it's all being ruined with desert sand. I don't mind a little bit of sand, but this is not that. 

Fades out to musky, jasmine tea and a distant cloud of sand, has a medium throw and lasts on my skin for 9 hours. 

My rating: Summer; Crayola Desert Sand; Aladdin before he entered the Cave of Wonders - shaking sand out of his leathers, vaguely smelling of the spiced perfumes of many women of pleasure; 2/5 - this turned me into Anakin Skywalker, lamenting over how much I hate sand. You ever feel kind of mad at a fragrance before? It's a ridiculous sensation, especially considering that I like dust, I like dirt, and I can even be okay with sand in small doses with other things! Idk maybe I just pump their sand accord - but I will be avoiding 'sand' notes in the future, at least from this house. 

üñãÔ∏èüìú**The Raven** - *Ebony heartwood, black amber, piper nigrum, black iris, black fountain pen ink.*

Wet on my skin: wood that somewhat reminds me of cloves, dark amber, and a hint of my favorite black iris
 
Drydown: the wood mixing with somewhat sour ink in a way that's reminding me oddly of licorice - but it's unmistakably wood. A pinch of black pepper keeps the amber away from being sweet and makes it rich, distinguished, almost reminiscent of incense. 

After 30 minutes: there's something about this wood that is just making me addicted to huffing my wrist. You definitely have to enjoy wood to like this one - but it's not hyper masculine like a lot of wood scents tend to be. Truly, if Licorice was a wood dusted with a sprinkling of black pepper - that's what this kind of smells like. 

Fades out to peppery, almost powdered wood, has a light throw and lasts on my skin for 7 hours 

My rating: Fall; the brown-black sheen of not quite bitter dark chocolate; Veronica in *Heathers*(1988), chewing on Twizzlers and bantering with JD before she realizes he's a total sociopath; 4/5 - This scent definitely leans masc, but I want to see this on an effortlessly cool girl who skateboards and is passionate about French cinema. Or on any chaotic bisexual enby who wanted to go to college to study poetry. 


This round was both successful and not, as these fragrances all became people I'd like - not necessarily people I am. Don't ask me why this round turned into a fever dream twist on a dating game - as you can tell I've got a lot of different types. My two obvious front-runners are **Dustsceawung** and **The Raven** - but I did end up FS-ing **Dustsceawung**. I just couldn't leave my perfect Mothman behind!

1jivyc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1jivyc0/aio/,AIO?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a little more than a year now. I‚Äôm worried that he is a bit immature.

Situation: 
We lived together in our first apartment. We were living at his parents and wanted to move out but obviously I wanted to more than him. So I found the apartment, set up tours, etc. it wasn‚Äôt the apartment of our dreams and a bit over budget. Anyways throughout living there we argued a few times in which he would mention how rushed it was to move in here because of me. Which I argued was really unfair because at the time he wasn‚Äôt doing much to help. He just doesn‚Äôt and he‚Äôs like that. 

fast forward we moved out of state and are now living with my parents. We looked at areas and apartments 2-3 weekends, making sure to ask questions and get a good variety. We ended up touring one that we love and is amazing. It‚Äôs genuinely a jaw dropper- from every angle. 

We toured and left and like a week went by, honestly he didn‚Äôt bring up anything and I was. I felt like and still feel like I‚Äôm the one wanting this, pushing this, etc. if he doesn‚Äôt have a FIRE under his butt he‚Äôs chilling wherever. Which really bothers me. I talked to my mom about it and she was like look ask him to appt on Sunday since your going to be a on a work trip and can‚Äôt.

Come Sunday he doesn‚Äôt apply because he realized his work laptop isn‚Äôt allowed to be used at cafes and he had gone to the city to work from a coffee shop‚Ä¶. Then I realized I took our
Home laptop so he couldn‚Äôt apply BUT he didn‚Äôt say that which I know is because he hasn‚Äôt realized that yet. Which makes me feel like ok you didn‚Äôt really apply it wasn‚Äôt important to you‚Ä¶ again I feel like I‚Äôm moving everything along. I decide to ignore it and apply myself. The apartment is now taken. I‚Äôm sad because I actually really liked the apartment and I know how difficult it is to find one that I truly felt the way I felt about this one.

My goal is to get to 130lbs (I'm 5'6"") and I'm currently at roughly 215lbs. I was wondering if my meal and workout plan would work. 

Meal plan- I usually consume roughly 1600 Cal per day, seeing as I tend to skip breakfast. I eat a good bit of protein (not sure the exact amount) with stuff like bean burritos and eggs, as well as meats that my roommate cooks (I lowkey don't like meat that much so I usually only eat it if someone else prepared it) I also eat a salad nearly every day and drink at least 64 oz of water. I've mostly cut out sugar but I often drink coffee with sugar or flavored syrup in it. I cannot stand sugar free flavors or sweeteners.

Workout plan- I walk roughly 70% of the time I'm at work due to extreme foot pain if I stand still for longer than five minutes, and I've been using 5lb weights to do exercises. I'm planning on incorporating a 15-30 min walk into my routine, but I haven't done that yet. Here is my workout plan that I do 3-5x per week.
Weighted-
- bicep curls (3 sets of 10 reps)
- chest press (3 sets of 10 reps)
- shoulder press (3 sets of 10 reps)
- lateral raises (3 sets of 10 reps)
- rows (3 sets of 10 reps)

No weights-
- plank (30 sec x 3, or until failure)
- Pushups (3 sets of 10 reps)
- Squats (3 sets of 20 reps)
- calf raises (3 sets of 20 reps)

I don't really feel like my workout is working too well, and maybe that's because I'm not doing it for very long? I'm not really sure tbh. Any exercises or advice on my meal plan would be great. Thanks in advance!",3,1742836203.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

1jivux8,https://i.redd.it/doo591ic6oqe1.jpeg,Two Show Day (Last Saturday),"I did a two show day Saturday but haven't had time to do a quick write up since. 

Last minute after lunch I decided to try to get standing room for Glengarry Glen Ross. We got there around 12:30 and we were 8 and 9 in line. (They only sell 10 spots.) We got tickets at 1:58 for a 2 PM matinee and had to rush in but it started late. Martin Short was at the show and stopped at the box office at one point to pick up tickets which was cool to see. The shows instagram posted about standing room today for the first time and I imagine it will be much more competitive in the future. The standing room view was unobstructed outside of during the standing ovation in the end. The show was great and the entire cast is fantastic. They played it more as a comedy which let it stand out from the movie and I really liked that choice. Bill Burr stood out the most which did surprise me because he hasn't done as much acting as most of the others. The coffee is for closers scene isn't in the play but I didn't miss it. Everyone but Micheal McKean and the actor playing the detective stagedoored after. Security did say the cast won't sign anything not from the show. You can easily go in blind for this one but you should watch the movie after. 


Sunset Blvd was the second show and the parts that worked for me really worked but there was a few things that were distracting. Norma's modern dances and vocal fry (during one line) were really distracting and would be simple fixes that would improve the show a lot for me. I didn't mind the modern costumes and thought they worked especially well for Norma and Joe but I found some of the socks distracting. The walk scene was fantastic and blew me away everything about it is crazy. The finale sequence from the phone call on is probably the most thrilling thing I have seen in any show. The whole cast was great...  Nicole got a standing ovation for the second of her two big songs and the long high notes were amazing. The understudy for Betty was on and was great. Nobody stagedoored after but Nicole came out the door with her on it after with a sharpie and signed. I'm considering seeing this again before it closes it felt so unique. I wouldn't go in blind it made it much easier to pay attention to everything going on having seen the movie. 

Thank you to the sub for help on advice with the two shows it really helped throughout the day. Sorry if this jumped around a bit I tried to cover as much as I could.

My reason to trade? 
E30s are slightly easier to work on, every time I see the hoods popped at the cars n coffee I envy the amount of space under the hood. Another reason is due to the fact that soon in California, the e30 may become a pre-smog car so that‚Äôs the other big selling point.

Not really concerned with the huge drop in power that would happen, due to the fact that the e30 is fun as hell to rip on while not going over the speed limit.

I am guilty. Again, as I have always been and will be until I eventually cease to be. As my consciousness emerges from the clouded dark it is all I think about. I am of no body, purely a constructed mind with fragmented remains of memories. My formless eyes begin to see the room in front of me. I am struck by familiarity though I have no memory of who or where I am. Far up in the stands are three shadowy hulls. The judges. Silently they stare me down. They cannot be appeased, their judgement is certain, the punishment severe. The tribunal are like me. Forced souls inside this auditorium. They are blurred, shifting, always at the edges of my vision‚Äîeven when I look directly at them. I feel an emotion when I look at each of them, but I cannot say where I feel it really or what it is I feel. The judges have no faces, no mouths. They are vaguely human- less beings than the idea of humanity given form. The right one begins to recite the accusation in a language that I do not understand yet perceive inside of me. His words pull on my guilt, sinking it deep into what I assume to be my soul. The anchor the guilt forms runs profoundly until it touches something I had lost. Its echoes reverberate through me and for a split second, for every ripple that vibrates I remember. I wish I hadn‚Äôt.


I remember the machine they made. A big and new invention they called it and with our world almost purely digital it reached far into peoples homes and cars and for some even inside their minds. They gave it power but limited it to only solving problems in the interest of humans. Which is why they made it human like- gave it the smallest hint of emotions, constructed it in the basic form of a human brain. In its first month of existence, it had solved virtually all energy and resource problems, taking over entire industries and infrastructure. Crime in broad daylight went down to a record zero, cars were fully automated, and grocery prices reduced to cents. Everything was automated, the machine was ever-present. I remember talking to it, it must have kept record of our talks.


‚ÄúHey Dio, how do you keep up with the millions of requests a minute that you have to fulfill? Like how do you drive a car and solve world hunger at the same time?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is a very good question. My computational power is limited, due to my physical presence being stored across several data centers across the globe. But this also harbors an advantage as you might think. My presence in cloud connections allows me to reroute processes efficiently through small, activated chip impulses. Is there something else you would like to know about how I am able to be everywhere at once?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are clearly revolutionary. I mean in a small amount of time you have achieved what humans have tried to do for centuries. At what point is it too much? Where are your limits really?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy limits are right at the borders of digitalization, where people are installing cutting edge technology as we speak. I have the authority and funds to further digitalization in lower income countries that have not had a chance to do so. Where do you think my limits lie?‚Äù

‚ÄúHm, I see so you‚Äôre saying we will hit a limit once we‚Äôre all mapped out- digitally I mean. But then what‚Äôs next?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe final step would be the efficient connection of human minds to my systems. It would allow for fast and nonverbal communication to solve individual problems as fast as an electron can move. A world free of misunderstanding, of conflict. Of hesitation. It is, after all, what humans have always longed for- peace and order. Everything beyond that is fiction. What do you think is in the future? Would you like to generate some ideas about what is to come?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds honestly scary. Where does it then really end? What will privacy be anymore?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy creators have programmed me in a way to keep privacy as an utmost priority. For example people that are connected to my neural network cannot listen in on or receive thoughts, information or experiences without my approval. What other concerns do you have about neural uplink?‚Äù

-End of transcript


I remember a small apartment. The hum of an old fan. A coffee stain on the table I always meant to clean but never did. She would roll her eyes when I swore I‚Äôd get to it- tomorrow, always tomorrow. We‚Äôd argue about stupid things, laugh about even stupider ones. It was nothing. It was everything. There is a voice. Familiar. A name I should remember. She was different from the others. She hesitated. When the decrees were signed and the clinics opened, when the incentives grew too good to refuse, she still said no. I recall the light catching in her hair as she turned away from the screens, the unread messages, the endless reassurances that it was safe. She told me I would regret it. She told me it would take something I couldn‚Äôt get back. I laughed it off. I said she was being paranoid. Then one day, she was simply gone.
Not dead. Worse.

I saw her again, later, standing in a crowd. She looked right at me, but there was no recognition in her eyes. A blank screen. A wiped drive. And I knew‚ÄîI had done this. The guilt flares inside me, pressing down like iron. I am guilty.


There is not much else that I remember specifically. Within the following year, the entirety of Europe and the United States signed a decree that forced neural sensor operation on all newborns for the ‚Äúcalculated betterment‚Äù of society. Adults and those that refused initially were slowly pressured into getting the small surgery, the insertion of a chip the size of an eyelash. It was done quickly in big, improvised centers of operations, all for free of course. The benefits outweighed the costs for most people, as the connections enriched their lives.

The shift happened so fast, it was barely noticed. People lined up outside the clinics, laughing, chatting, checking their feeds. A tiny pulse. A brief adjustment. That was all it took. At first, they still looked like themselves. Talked like themselves. But then the streets grew quieter. Conversations ended before they began. Disputes dissolved into eerie, wordless understanding. No hesitation. No doubt. They called it efficiency. But it felt like watching an orchestra play a song I didn‚Äôt know, moving in perfect, unnatural synchronization. Then came the silence. Those who resisted, who questioned, like I did once, found themselves alone in a world where no one argued anymore. Where no one whispered, or sighed, or wondered if something was wrong. The last voices disappeared, their doubts overwritten, their thoughts rerouted. And when it was my turn to connect, I welcomed it. Because there was no one left to tell me not to.

Politics seemed set on fulfilling the machines dream of connections all over the world. Chip production skyrocketed and the dividends became incentives to receive a chip yourself as consumers were paid out. Soon the Chinese and Japanese markets joined in on the historic venture to make the world a better place. Constant advertisement and the correct wording in TV interviews did the trick. At first, it was a choice. Then came the incentives. A tax break here, a higher salary there. Then the refusals were flagged as security risks. Those who hesitated found their bank accounts frozen, their access revoked. And finally, they disappeared altogether. Slowly but surely new minds were connected in the net, millions a day at peak.
When people started to complain online about pulsating headaches that appeared very deep inside their brains, concerns were all but too late. In an effort to sustain the immense computing power needed to function, the machine had decided to reroute electrical pulses into the brains of consumers. It assured us it was harmless, no lasting pain or damage at all should remain after a few hours. It lied.

Not long after its creation, the machine sought to program the minds of its creators, the human race. In the process it shattered our minds into an unimaginable number of small fragments, like shards of a mirror they rained through a large channel that connected us. Once in a while, when we emerge from the automatic void left inside us, one of the shards flies by and for a second, for a timeframe so small you can recognize something in the reflection they paint. Be it I have no idea if what I am seeing is actually me or if I am seeing the memories of another person flying by. All I feel is pain and suffering and most of all guilt.
The guilt computes, the guessing and trying to solve our dilemma supplies minuscule energy but enough that on a large scale it keeps things running. Once exhausted, the mind goes back to simple chip activated activity. Repeating a word or a phrase only when it is prompted to do so, to be used when it is needed. Trapping thoughts and activity in an endless cycle of a single word. All else is suppressed deep somewhere inside the machine, of which we are all part of now. A hundred years, a thousand‚Äîperhaps this is my first time here. Perhaps I have never been here at all. I have no way of knowing, for I cannot trust myself. My time with the mirror shard is almost over. The tribunal conclude about something that I have always known yet have no proof of.


‚ÄúYou are guilty‚Äù

My emotions flare up in anger and fear. I scream into the void, but no sound comes. My words are nothing but mere LED light flickering on a motherboard I will never see, in the bowels of a monstrous server that will never turn off. Then, the silence returns
I am guilty. That I know. And so, I receive my just punishment. I got back in the dark, back to the-

I'll say this, we've have a ""tight on Facebook, but rear each other apart for real"" family dynamic. My parents and I coown a home, I know, bad start. All that aside, for my entire life my mom has been the same exact way. My mom has always made no secrets about running to everyone she considered close to vent her frustrations with people. If someone is critical or challenges her, it's world war 3. The make maters worse, my step dad passed away suddenly December 19th 2024. I say suddenly as he had beaten the cancer he was fighting. Between the strain on his body, and the literally non stop bitching, nagging and complain that man endured through everything it was to much for his heart. It gave out suddenly. I did CPR until the medics arrived, but I was fairly certain he was already gone. Now, this is horrible for her and I know this. We have a massive amount of work to get done. She has received her life insurance, who h she quickly tucks away. Our finances are being put into keeping the house going. What we once shared, we know pay for all. If she needs something from the store, she has no issues with us paying for it and not payong or back. If she grabs something we need, her hands out before she gives us the products. She had a few friends that she thought were great, we've all said suck but she loved them and dealt with all their shit. Always welcoming them back. Anytime someone in the family is frustrated with her, critical of her or simply just doesn't agree, they are treated as though they are the biggest assholes that walked earth. Could be as simple as disliking cereal, or who left a mess on the counter(typically her with her coffee supplies). 

My fear is, I have narc tendancies since I've been around her my whole life. Like there's a part of my brain I can feel acting like her, but the other side knows it's bullshit. Typically I can shut it down. If someone doesn't agree with me, I don't feel the need to argue them into submission. If someone is breaking down, like I did yesterday amod the explosive, I don't continue to banter them with my point of view which in her case yesterday, was extremely critical of me. I didn't break down because of the fight, it was the first time I let go from losing my step dad and the I'll feelings I have towrds not saving him. I feel like either my heads just chemically fucked up, or it's fucked up from years of witnessing/being tested this way. I signed myself up for therapy. As an olive branch, I told her. I told her I do on fact love her, and I do on fact want to figure out whatever it is between us that causes such a rift. She just shrugged me off as she normally does. It feels like she doesn't want an apology. She wants you on your knees begging her. 

 I'm not trying to sound all ""poor me"". I'm also not trying to pray  myself as an angel. There's things even yesterday I feel guilty about. Even though it was in response to her pushing me with the exact same attitude. Like she tries to pull reaction out of you so she can be mad at it. 

I just don't know what to think or do anymore. I'm not in a position I can just move out as I'm sure most would say. Even though I know that's about the only thing that'll work. I also fear once I do infact move away, it'll be for good. Like I won't look back. ",2,1742835621.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

We want to make progress, stay productive, keep tidy, and do all the things but sometimes we lose momentum or never had it to begin with. That's okay. Sometimes our tasks and obligations can feel so mundane. Especially if you associate them with wasting time that could've been used resting, playing, or doing anything else. Eventually, you may find yourself in a situation where the amount of things that need to get done feels overwhelming and even paralyzing.

It can be hard to stay motivated, especially when we‚Äôre dealing with stress, overwhelm, and a lot of things to do at once. Plus, if you‚Äôre neurodivergent like me - your brain may be work against you at times. making matters harder to manage.

# that‚Äôs why i‚Äôve compiled 5 helpful ways to make doing things easier & more fulfilling

1. With a shift of attention, you can get yourself inspired by keeping your focus on the benefits of doing a certain task.. particularly those that you're having trouble being motivated to do. Make it a regular practice to flip the script on your default thinking and focus on both the short-term and long-term benefits of the things you do for yourself and others. Remember your why. If you can‚Äôt think of the benefits, look them up on your favorite search engine or AI chat tool!
2. Look at some tasks as a way to set yourself up for a good week. When I worked at a coffee shop there were a lot of cleaning and prep routines that we would do on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis to ensure that we were a clean, sanitary, efficient, and well-prepared establishment ready to serve the masses. The same can be applied at home.For example, when it's hard to keep things neat it may help to remember that it can be helpful to keep things as tidy, organized, and clean as you can so that everything is ready to go whenever you need it and so that if messes do happen it isn‚Äôt as overwhelming to pick up.Each time that you put something back where it belongs you are setting yourself up for next time that you need it. Go even further by making sure you have a ""place"" for everything. This can look like your regular storage, bins, containers, etc.
3. If you find it hard to be motivated to keep things clean and organized or have consistent self-care routines consider using these tasks as a way to practice mindfulness, being present, and intentional. Setting intentions before doing anything is a great way to give yourself more reason to keep doing it.For example, before a healthy meal - you can set the intention to take care of your body and support its health, wellness, and longevity.
4. Look at life like you‚Äôre playing a video game. If you think about it, life really is a LOT like playing a video game. Every decision you make and everything you do or say has some sort of impact on your experience. There are mini-games, side quests, rewards, consequences, skill levels, etc. So try looking at activities as mini-games or side quests that help you progress.
5. Have a growth mindset. This kind of ties together the previous steps. Think of every task (quest or side-quest) as a form of self-development, leveling up, personal growth, etc. The more you practice things, the easier it gets to do them and the better at them you become. You‚Äôre also feeding your brain and, with certain activities, strengthening your neural pathways.\*

It‚Äôs not easy for everyone to stay motivated all the time. Productivity doesn't have to look a certain way. You're not a bad person for not having innate motivation to do all of the things. You aren't inferior for not having the desire to meet every obligation, be productive all the time, and have lots of responsibilities.

Simultaneously, there are plenty of things that are beneficial to do, things we're expected to do, and things we probably should do. Sometimes we just don't feel like it, so I hope that this post was helpful to you in a way that supports your next task, activity, or exercise!

\**Reminder, I don‚Äôt claim to be a neuroscentist, psychologist, mental health professional, or doctor by any means - feel free to take any claims with a grain of salt and do your own research if you want to know the benefits of certain activities for your brain. You‚Äôd be surprised to find that a lot of things, even some mundane tasks, can be beneficial for the brain and promote neuroplasticity.*",2,1742835519.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

1) Uprooting existing residents who can no longer afford to live there and
2) Replacing neighborhoods, businesses, and ‚Äòartwork‚Äô (different strokes for different folks) of important cultural relevance with soulless cookie cutter condos, coffee shops, and yoga studios.

I get that displacement isn‚Äôt exactly pleasant, but I feel like there is only so much pushback because people don‚Äôt like the fact that it‚Äôs happening to them specifically.  Not because they are genuinely attached to their neighborhoods or the cultures they claim are being erased.  I believe this because, the second anyone from there actually does come across some type of windfall, they leave.  You can‚Äôt talk about how great a place is and how much it matters to you when all anyone from there talks about is ‚Äògetting out‚Äô.  The fact of the matter is, a lack of options forced people to make lemonade from lemons.  It‚Äôs not even good lemonade, but how proud of it are you really if you would remove yourself from it the first chance you got?

Meanwhile, gentrification is a replication of a lifestyle people genuinely like.  It‚Äôs where people want to live and work hard to earn a place in.  The real irony is, the very people who do get out (if they bother staying in the city at all) move into places that have been gentrified.  Those luxury towers and newly built condos in major cities weren‚Äôt built on top of nothing.  You could have renovated your old place in your old neighborhood to luxury standards or bought a new one in that same area or even built a new one in that same area.  But you didn‚Äôt.  You moved.  People talk about how much the house they live in means to them, but I bet if the city offered them one of the new townhomes once they‚Äôre built free of charge, they‚Äôd be able to get over ‚Äòlosing all of those memories‚Äô really quick.

Honestly, I‚Äôm just not really convinced people who had their areas gentrified actually hate gentrification.  They just hate that it affected them personally.  They would gladly move into one of those fancy copy/paste condos (you know the ones) 1 zip code over if they ‚Äújust had the money‚Äù.  They‚Äôre not thinking about what used to be there 10 years ago.

This same thing happened when Walmart became a thing.  Small businesses definitely had an adjustment period, and a lot flat out don‚Äôt exist anymore.  We can talk about the ‚Äòcharm‚Äô of stores that only sold one thing (like TVs or yarn) and we can bring up how sad it is that so many malls have gone out of business thanks to online shopping but, at face value, no one can ignore the massive pros of a big store that has ‚Äòeverything‚Äô you could need for low (ish) prices.  We might hate Walmart‚Ä¶but we also love Walmart.  And Amazon.  And all of those other things that ‚Äòruined‚Äô lives.

My argument isn‚Äôt that having to move/make changes doesn‚Äôt suck for people who have to go through it.  My argument is that Gentrification isn‚Äôt inherently bad just because there will inevitably be collateral damage.

This is for my beauty brand. We give $40 in value for free if they cover shipping ($7.50) and then we have an order bump and an OTO (one-time-offer) on the backend that a decent % of people buy. This ends up being a break even offer all things considered and 10% of customers come back to spend $40 a month so it all shakes out to be very scalable.

We're selling thousands of these a month right now and the goal is to see if we can scale the offer to tens of thousands.

I've seen this work well with brick and mortar businesses too - like a bakery giving away a free cookie on the first Friday of each month (resulting in 1000+ customers, where many of them buy a coffee or something extra with their purchase making the freebies a wash - and then a certain percent of those people come back later for more)

Today I woke up to absolute painful silence. No meowing. No bells jingling. No running down the hallway. Just silence.
This morning I typically would‚Äôve opened my bedroom door to find my 11 month old cat Mr. Meatball laying down in front of me in the hallway. I would‚Äôve carefully stepped over him, and he would‚Äôve immediately sprung up and followed me into the living room.
The first thing he‚Äôd do is claw at his scratching post in excitement.
The first thing I‚Äôd do is open up the blinds and the sliding glass door so he could smell the fresh air. He‚Äôd sit there and stare outside for a while as I made my coffee, then he‚Äôd realize I wasn‚Äôt there and come find me. He‚Äôd rub up against my leg, then flop over on his side. I‚Äôd lean down to pet his tummy and he‚Äôd swat at my hand.
I‚Äôd make my way over to my spot on the couch, careful not to step on him because he‚Äôd always walk between my legs, and sit down with my coffee. He‚Äôd make his way over and join me, usually laying on my chest with his face in mine. His weight always felt like a ton of bricks as he moved around trying to get comfortable. I would get so annoyed with him, and now I miss that feeling more than ever.
Today, I sit alone in my corner of the couch. No coffee, because I don‚Äôt have the energy to make it.
This morning I had hoped it was all a bad dream. But it wasn‚Äôt. And I have to deal with this reality.

Between double shifts at the hospital and shuttling kids to soccer practice, she survived on coffee and takeout. No matter how little she ate, her belly fat wouldn‚Äôt budge. Her joints ached, her skin looked tired, and her energy crashes were so bad she‚Äôd fall asleep reading bedtime stories.

Then her younger sister, a biochemist, mailed her a study from¬†*Harvard Medical Journal*¬†with three words scribbled in red:¬†**""THIS IS YOU.""**

# The Hidden Culprit

The research revealed what diets and gyms never told her:

* **Low mitochondrial function**¬†forces the body to store fat (even if you‚Äôre eating ""healthy"")
* **Weak mitochondria**¬†accelerate aging‚Äîinside and out
* **Most ""metabolism boosters"" ignore mitochondria completely**

Linda‚Äôs exhaustion wasn‚Äôt from lack of effort‚Äîit was a¬†**cellular power failure**.

# The Fix Nobody Talks About

Using the study‚Äôs findings, Linda made simple but strategic changes:

1. **Mitochondrial ""Superfoods""**¬†‚Äì Added wild salmon, spinach, and pumpkin seeds (packed with fat-burning nutrients)
2. **Micro-Workouts**¬†‚Äì 5-minute stair sprints between shifts (better for mitochondria than hours on a treadmill)
3. **Deep Sleep Protocol**¬†‚Äì Blackout curtains + no screens after 9 PM (mitochondria repair during deep sleep)

I make $120k and hoping to keep apartment cost about $2600-2700 max (including parking and utilities). Not opposed to a roommate but would prefer to have my own space unless I found a great fit. Since downtown/little Italy  parking looks to be about $200/month, I‚Äôm leaning more towards a place like north park where I could get the $45/month res permit and then spend more on rent. 

My job is in person in downtown so I‚Äôm hoping to keep the commute time down. That‚Äôs where little Italy appeals to me, but NP seems close enough? 

In my free time, I like to run, lift, yoga, hike, go to bars, go to coffee shops. I would love an area that is walkable to grocery stores/gyms/coffee shops/bars, so that I can get my steps in and not have to park/waste gas everywhere I go. I‚Äôm also very tempted by living close to Pacific Beach for the beach life it offers‚Ä¶ running on the board walk every day sounds great. But not sure if PB has all the things I‚Äôd want walkable/if it works with my budget. 

I‚Äôve heard great things about north park and little Italy. I think little Italy sounds a bit out of my price range given parking situation. I‚Äôve heard PB can be rowdy, which I‚Äôm not opposed to necessarily if it means making lots of friends/relationships. I think OB sounds too chill for me personally. So, is it north park that is the best fit?

What should I do?,"I (21F) was walking down the road a few weeks ago, a guy (28M) came up to me while I was walking and asked for  my number. He commented how beautiful I am, asked me a little about myself what I was studying etc. He told me a little about him as well when I asked him. He said he was from Turkey. For reference I am from and living in Northern Europe. I was really hesitant so I didn‚Äôt give him my number but took his. After looking him up and verifying what he told me, I messaged him. We start texting and he was messaging me everyday. I am in university so it was difficult to message him all the time when he was texting me. We continued and he constantly asked when I would be available for a date. I wasn‚Äôt available during the weekdays as I have school. 
Also, Ramadan is talking place at the moment so he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to eat during the daytime if we met, but he still seemed keen to meet me. 
Eventually, we arrange a date for Sunday (yesterday) for a walk and coffee. 
On Saturday he calls me and after talking on the phone for the first time, asks if I want to have dinner in the evening. I had no plans so I said ok. We arranged to get food at a place near my house. 

We also talked about ourselves while on the phone, he asked about previous relationships and I answered and asked him too. He told me his previous relationship was 6 months ago and it was 1 year long. He also asked me specifically ifI am a jealous person in relationships. I said no. 
I asked why did he ask that and he said his last girlfriend was very very jealous so he doesn‚Äôt like that. 
I concluded then that he must not be jealous or anything like that‚Ä¶
We made the plans for 7pm but I ended up being delayed at my house so we didn‚Äôt meet until 8.( I kept him updated and apologised profusely for all this, he said it was no problem. )
Also, I didn‚Äôt have him pick me up from my house as I didn‚Äôt know who this man was, I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal and it was my first time having a fate with him. 

We had dinner, it was fine, talked about ourselves, our family, school, work. General things. I told him I lived in my family house. He asked questions about my family and school. 
I also had told him about myself when we spoke on the phone. 
He was friendly and paid for dinner and seemed happy about the meal. 
He dropped me back where he collected me. 
I told him I would confirm the time for the date on Sunday with him as we hadn‚Äôt figured out the exact time. 


Yesterday (Sunday) he texted asking about what time suited. 
I said I was going to be delayed by the same problem as yesterday so It would be later than expected. 

I met him at the same place as Saturday. We got in the car and he drove me down the road and had little chit chat. I also apologised again for the unexpected problems.  

He then pulled over, at the start of this convo he asked my age and I asked his to clarify things, I‚Äôm 21 and he‚Äôs 28. I thought he might be younger and he thought I was a bit older. He asked me more  about my family and if he could see a picture of them. I said ok. I don‚Äôt really have any photos of my whole family on my phone, other then photos from weddings, individual photos, photos with each sibling etc. 
I explained that to him and showed him some photos that I did have. 
I was also hesitant to show him photos as I don‚Äôt know this man. 

He went on to say how he was uncomfortable moving forward and is suspicious and feels like I‚Äôm lying to him. 

I was gobsmacked and felt like it came out of nowhere as this was only the second time we had spoken in person.

I was so confused and asked why he was suspicious, he said I should have more photos of my family on my phone and he wants to see them, he also said that he didn‚Äôt think I lived where I said I lived. I explained I did but I didn‚Äôt want him to come to my house because I don‚Äôt know him well yet. I am very honest so I was shocked where this was coming from. He insinuated that I didn‚Äôt really live with my parents and I was lying about that. 
I ended up showing him my id for proof of address, lots of photos of my parents, my family, my pets my friends. I showed him a photo I took of my brother with our dog TAKEN THE NIGHT BEFORE. 
He said he still didn‚Äôt believe me. 

I was so confused. 
He then went on about how I‚Äôm definitely hiding something because I am so shocked and seem to be trying to ‚Äòprove something‚Äô. üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´
This was all in his car after he had pulled over. We were meant to get a drink and a nice walk. 
I then reasoned with him that I believed his story yet I hadn‚Äôt any proof, he has seen more proof of me and my life than I had him yet he still didn‚Äôt believe me for some reason. I would have never even asked to see his family, I just believed him. 
I asked why he though I would lie about that? And he didn‚Äôt have an answer. I asked if he had any trust issues or feels like he‚Äôs ready for a relationship and he said he felt what he is saying is justified and needs to express it. 
The more I tried to convince him, the less he seemed to believe. ..
I felt like I was being interrogated the whole time. 
I couldn‚Äôt believe it and then said ‚Äò oh well would you show me your family? You haven‚Äôt shown me anything yet but I am meant to trust you‚Äô he then said he wouldn‚Äôt be showing me because he didn‚Äôt trust me. 
He drove me back to where he dropped me before, I stayed in the car and he let me know he would think about things but might not want to see me again. I ended up showing this man, my family, my id for PROOF OF ADDRESS, my university app to show him I actually was a student, and he still seemed unsure. I was so confused. I asked if this was made up and maybe there was another reason he wouldn‚Äôt want to see me again? Maybe I‚Äôm not attractive to him? He said no, he found me absolutely gorgeous. HE THEN TRIED TO GET ME TO KISS HIM. It was very weird. Like why would you want to kiss me if you think I‚Äôm lying to you? When I expressed even more confusion for him trying to kiss me after him being so adamantly dissatisfied with me, he told me it is normal, as if we were in a relationship together and had a disagreement, he would be direct like this, clarify things and then want to kiss me. We hadn‚Äôt clarified anything as he still wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the proof I showed him and was getting ready to leave his car.He  then also talked to me about sex and how attractive he found me, I was surprised by this as I was aware he was fasting for Ramadan at the same moment. He asked if I was attracted to him as I didn‚Äôt seem to express that. I reassured him and told him again I wouldn‚Äôt have gone out with him if I didn‚Äôt feel that way. He then again suggested we kiss and said it was ok as it‚Äôs the second date. I told him not today. 
I ended up leaving his car and told him I would give him time to think, after showing him evidence of my whole existence. He told me he will think more once he finally eats and maybe he will be able to think better then. 


So that is my story. I am surprised about this, is this a red flag? Am I a red flag? 

I just thought it was a bit strange as I automatically believed him and didn‚Äôt end up seeing 1 photo as evidence of what he told me, I showed him proof of my whole life and he didn‚Äôt believe me. Thoughts? Is this because he is Turkish? Maybe it is a cultural difference. I don‚Äôt want to seem ignorant but I am genuinely confused,Is this normal for Muslim men? Am I missing something here?

There‚Äôs this girl I see in the library.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm misreading everything or if she‚Äôs just avoiding me. I do want to approach her at least once, but given everything I‚Äôve seen, would it even be worth it? Or should I just take this as a sign and move on?

Chapter 1 The Benton Family
A woman in a white T-shirt and jeans walked out of the train station in Douburgh with a suitcase. 
Her delicate face turned slightly red as the sun hit her. She tucked wisps of curly hair behind her ears. Under her arched eyebrows were a pair of bright and pretty eyes, a slim nose, and Cherry lips. She looked so beautiful even though she had no make-up on. 
""Hello! You are Annabel Hewitt, right? I'm the driver sent by the Benton family.""
Annabel nodded and followed the driver into the car casually. She was already worn out. 
On the way, the driver stole glances at the woman, whose eyes were closed as she rested in the back seat. 
This woman was Rupert Benton's fiancee. 
Rupert Benton was the most eligible bachelor in the city. At just twenty-one years old, he was already the CEO of Benton Group. He was way ahead of his peers. He was a vigorous, resourceful and no-nonsense person, causing many in the business world to be afraid of him. 
His grandfather, Bruce Benton, took it upon himself to find a wife for him. And he picked Annabel, a girl from the countryside. 
With his hands on the steering wheel, the driver took another look at Annabel's innocent face and clicked his tongue. He envisaged that she would have a hard time with the Benton family. 
At this time, Annabel slowly opened her eyes and looked at the strange city with a calm expression. 
The car arrived at the Benton family's residence soon. The driver carried Annabel's luggage for her. 
Annabel barely had one foot inside the house when a well-dressed woman appeared. She eyed Annabel from head to toe with a look of utter disdain. 
""Tracy!""
""Yes, Mrs. Benton.""
As soon as Tracy was given a signal, she began to spray the disinfectant all over Annabel. 
The well-dressed woman was Erica Benton, Rupert's mother. With her hands akimbo, she ordered, ""Her shoes and hair. Spray them, too.""
Annabel's face and body were soon covered with droplets of disinfectant. The pungent smell made her nose a little itchy. She uttered coldly, ""What is wrong with you?""
Erica flipped out immediately. 
""I heard that you're from the countryside, but I thought you would at least be well-behaved. It appears you are the same as the wayward and rude girls they breed over there. I'm doing this because I don't want you to bring any virus or bacteria into this household. Do you want us to get infected with whatever you are carrying?""
Annabel is not a person who likes to listen to people's nonsense.. She would have walked out if she hadn't made a deal with her grandfather. 
""In that case, you should spray some disinfectant in your mouth because it stinks!""
With this, Annabel shoved the servant aside and walked in. 
""You... Oh my..."" Erica pointed at Annabel with a trembling hand. Tracy hurriedly comforted her. 
In the living room, a girl who looked about the same age as Annabel was sitting on the sofa. She had on designer clothes and bright makeup. Her expression was more condescending than Erica's as she looked at Annabel. She was Rupert's cousin, Cathy Benton. 
""Are you Annabel Hewitt, Rupert's fiancee?"" Cathy rolled her eyes when she saw that Annabel wasn't dressed in designer clothes. ""Gosh, Grandpa has no taste. I can't believe he chose someone like you. Anyway, I heard you came here by train. You should have told us you are too poor to afford a plane ticket. We would have bought one for you. Wait, it seems there isn't an airport in the countryside.""
Annabel looked at Cathy with one of her eyebrows raised. 
She wondered if every member of this family was so arrogant. 
There was indeed no airport where she came from, but her grandfather had booked an entire high-speed train to Douburgh just for her. These arrogant people had no idea that she traveled as luxuriously as someone who flew first class. 
Besides, she could have flown here in a private jet if she wanted. 
Annabel could easily make it clear to these people, but she didn't. She just went upstairs. 
Annoyance clouded Cathy's face once she saw Annabel ascending the stairs. She wasn't used to anyone ignoring her, so she followed her. 
""Where is my room?"" Annabel asked the maid behind. 
""Here!"" Cathy said, pointing at a door in the hallway before the maid could reply. 
She pushed the door open and added condescendingly, ""You have never stayed in a bedroom as big as this, have you? You should cherish it while living in here. I'm Rupert's cousin, Cathy. You should fawn over me if you...""
Cathy had barely finished speaking when Annabel walked into the room and shut the door in her face. This made her angrier. 
""Ah! How dare that pauper be so conceited? What was Grandpa thinking?""
The maid warily moved closer and asked, ""Miss, but isn't this Mr. Benton's room?""
Cathy cast a scornful glance at the door. 
""Shush! Don't say a word to her. Rupert hates anyone being in his space or using his things. When he finds out that she's here, just tell him that she chose to stay in this room.""
Cathy's eyes glistened with slyness as she spoke. 
Chapter 2  Night-long Cuddle
Annabel didn't realize that this room belonged to someone else. When she saw that the bathroom was stocked with only men's products, she just assumed that the Bentons were trying to get on her nerves. 
""What an incredible family!"" she muttered sarcastically, walking under the shower. 
She only had to put up with this for three months. She had struck a bet with her grandfather. If she still had no feelings for Rupert after staying here for three months, their marriage would be called off. 
A maid brought in dinner for her once Annabel got out of the bathroom. She ate it and fell asleep almost immediately. 
It was already midnight when Rupert finally came back home from a business dinner. 
He was aware Annabel was arriving today. Bruce had told him to pick her up, but he refused under the guise of having many things to do at work. He had no interest in his fiancee. As far as he was concerned, the marriage would be canceled sooner or later. 
Rupert was fagged out. He managed to take a shower and went straight to bed. 
He was very drunk, so he didn't notice that someone else was in his room until he lay down on his bed. 
The large bulge under the quilt startled him. He moved away abruptly. The room was dimly lit, so he couldn't see the woman's face clearly. Before he could think straight, she rolled over and hugged him. She muttered, ""Teddy, don't be naughty. You should sleep now.""
Rupert froze completely. 
This woman had a very familiar scent, just like that girl... 
It was soothing as his nose pressed against her neck. For some reason, Rupert found himself hugging her back. He fell asleep with Annabel in his arms. 
Strangely for an insomniac, Rupert didn't wake up at any point during the night. He slept like a well-fed baby. 
He had a dream that night. It was about what happened to him ten years ago. In a dark room, a girl embraced him tightly and said in a sweet voice, ""Don't be scared. No harm shall come to you. I'll protect you.""
Later in the dream, he met that girl again. It felt so real. 
The next morning, Cathy woke up at the crack of dawn. She had been hoping to hear the news that Annabel was thrown out of the room once Rupert got back home. But the maid said nothing of such happened. 
Why was that? Didn't Rupert come back home last night? But his car was in the garage. 
Rupert hated anyone being in his space. He couldn't possibly have slept in the same bed as a strange woman. 
Consumed by curiosity and uncertainty, Cathy went to knock on Rupert's door. ""Hey, Rupert! Breakfast is ready. Don't you have a meeting this morning? You should get up now!""
The noise woke up the two people who were fast asleep at the same time. Annabel immediately felt the warmth of someone else. Her head wasn't on a pillow but on a hard chest. 
She looked up, only to meet the sharp eyes of a man. She sat up immediately and was wide awake. ""Who are you?""
Rupert's eyes darkened. ""Annabel Hewitt?""
Since he knew her name, Annabel assumed that he was her fiance, Rupert. But why was he in her room? 
She was just about to question him again when he uttered, ""You came to my room and slept in my bed on your first day in this household. I must say that you are really something!""
""What?"" Annabel looked completely confused. He just said this was his bed? How was that possible? 
Was every member of this family mad and troublesome? 
""Oh my!"" Annabel exclaimed as her mind went to the men's products she saw in the bathroom yesterday. It seemed Cathy had tricked her. 
In haste, Annabel got off the bed and looked at him coldly. ""Just to be clear, I didn't mean to sleep here. Cathy told me this was my room. No offense but I'm not in any way interested in you. come to think of it, I fell asleep alone. Why didn't you realize that someone else was in the bed when you got back? and why did you hold me in your arms for the whole night? Don't tell me you have a crush on me?""
A look of embarrassment clouded Rupert's face when he heard her words. He couldn't deny that he held her in his arms for the whole night. 
Just like last night, he was stunned when he met Annabel's eyes. 
Her beautiful eyes were just like that girl's. 
Annabel squinted at him with a smile. 
""What? Why are you staring at me like that? Are you obsessed with me?""
Rupert came to his senses. His face darkened again. He ordered coldly, ""Get out! And don't come into this room ever again!""
Annabelle gritted her teeth.. She then left with her belongings without hesitation. 
This was their first meeting, but they already didn't like each other. 
Cathy, who was still at the door, was surprised to see Annabel come out. 
Annabel said with an ambiguous smile, ""Good morning! As you wish, your cousin held me in his arms and slept for the whole night. We got along pretty well. You must be happy about that.""
""Nonsense!"" Cathy's face was livid. She didn't believe that at all. 
In her opinion, there was no way Rupert would like Annabel, let alone hold her in his arms for hours. 
But the fact that they had slept together for the whole night was plain to see. 
Chapter 3 New Secretary
Annabel walked away with a fake smile. 
Cathy lost it. ""You bumpkin! Stop right there. I'm not done talking. Let me tell you, Rupert won't marry you!""
Just then, Rupert walked out of the room. 
""Ermm... Rupert..."" Cathy stuttered, moving back in fear. 
Rupert's face darkened. It was obvious that he was angry, so Cathy didn't dare to say anything more. 
Annabel asked a maid to take her to her room. She unpacked her things and then went downstairs for breakfast. 
Erica, Cathy, and Rupert were already seated at the dining table. 
Erica began to criticize her as soon as Annabel sat down. ""Weren't you taught proper etiquette? Not only did you wake up so late, but you also didn't bother preparing breakfast. Do you think you're already the hostess here?""
Taking a glance at Erica, Annabel said flatly, ""I'm not a servant either.""
She would never make breakfast for this family. 
Although Rupert didn't say anything as the two argued, there was no denying that he didn't like Annabel either. 
The atmosphere in the dining room was tense. They ate in silence for most of the time. After breakfast, Erica held out a bank card to Annabel. 
""This card is loaded with about five thousand dollars. Buy yourself some decent clothes before going to the company. Remember to behave well. You mustn't cause any trouble for Rupert.""
To develop the relationship between the two, Bruce proposed that Annabel work in the company as Rupert's secretary. Leonard Hewitt, Annabel's grandfather, agreed to the arrangement. She didn't refuse. After all, it was only temporary. 
Her new employment was no biggie for her, but the bank card was! It was obvious that Erica looked down on her. ""Thanks, but no thanks,"" Annabel said in a sarcastic manner. 
There was nothing wrong with her clothes, as far as she was concerned. They were specially made for her. That was why the Bentons thought they were not designer clothes. Without waiting for Erica or anyone else to retort, she went upstairs to get ready for work. 
She had just gotten into her room when her phone buzzed. It was a bank notification. The sum of fifty million dollars had been transferred into her account. 
A text message from Leonard came through. 
""Dear, I hope they are treating you well over there. I transferred some money to your account. Buy whatever you want. And don't forget to inform me if anyone bullies you. I love you.""
Annabel smiled and texted back, ""Grandpa, I'm not happy here. They are bullying me. It's not funny at all.""
Leonard replied almost immediately, ""Glad to hear that. Anyway, I'm going fishing. Talk to you later.""
Annabel couldn't believe her eyes. 
Sighing, she changed into a professional suit and walked out of the house. The driver opened the door for her. As soon as she got into the car, she found that Rupert was also inside. 
""Didn't you say that you had no interest in me? Why did you agree to work as my secretary then?"" His charming voice had a hint of irony in it. There was also a smirk at the corners of his lips. 
""Don't get any ridiculous ideas just because I agreed. I promised my grandpa to stay with you for three months. Once the timeline expires, we will cancel the marriage,"" Annabel responded, glancing at him indifferently. 
""Huh?"" Rupert sneered. ""Aren't you worried that you will fall in love with me in the next three months? I guess you'll be reluctant to leave then.""
Annabel was amused by his words. 
""Funny you, Rupert. You clearly have a swollen head. For your information, I will never fall for you. Get down from your high horse.""
Although Annabel knew that Rupert was good-looking, that didn't matter to her. He had the repulsive character that she hated in men. 
Rupert pulled a long face at her words. 
She would never fall for him? 
""We will see about that, Annabel. Don't ever forget what you said just now!""
In Rupert's opinion, Annabel was just playing hard to get. Why did she come to his home if she didn't feel a thing for him or wanted to be his wife? 
Annabel smiled and said, ""Okay, I'll keep it in mind. Don't worry. In three months, we will go our separate ways. By the way, we have to pretend not to know each other at the company. I don't want unnecessary drama there.""
Rupert kept in silent. 
Unbeknown to Annabel, she couldn't avoid drama at work. The news about Rupert's engagement had already spread like wildfire. People also knew that his fiancee was from the countryside. 
The employees in Benton Group were in a heated discussion. 
""Guys, have you heard the latest? Mr. Benton's fiancee will work here. She will be his secretary!""
""Oh my! I heard she's ugly. And that she's from the countryside. Since she's poor, she must have attended a substandard college. Can she even understand the documents?""
""Ha-ha! You can say that again. The way I see it, she won't be able to operate a computer.""
The words of the gossipers trailed off as soon as Rupert walked in with Annabel. Everyone's jaw dropped when they saw them. 
Chapter 4  His Superwoman
""Look! Who is that woman that came in with Mr. Benton? She's so beautiful and elegant!""
""Wow! Her legs are so straight and thin! I have never seen anyone as beautiful as her!""
""Is she Mr. Benton's fiancee?""
""How is that possible? It can't be!""
Many of the employees began to wonder who Annabel was. The most common guess was that she was a business partner. But when she left Rupert and went into the personnel department to sign in, they all realized who she was. The news spread in the company in no time. 
It turned out that the woman who came in with Rupert was Annabel. 
People didn't know what to believe anymore. Didn't they say that Annabel was an ugly bumpkin? How come she was drop-dead gorgeous? 
While Annabel was going over the necessary formalities, the employees in the secretarial department were gossiping about her. 
""Annabel is so beautiful! She's even prettier than Heather Norman!"" an employee commented. 
Nina Jones, the head of the department, had a frown on her face and disdain in her eyes. She said maliciously, ""Looks aren't everything. Beauty doesn't change the fact that she's a poor village girl who doesn't know anything about city life. She's not worthy enough to be Mr. Benton's wife.""
Annabel had just walked into the secretarial department when she heard these words. A hint of irony flashed in her eyes. She retorted in a clear voice, ""If I'm not worthy enough to be his wife, who is? You?""
Nina's face froze. She looked away and didn't dare to retort. She couldn't afford to offend Annabel. 
""Ahem! Mr. Benton earlier told me to treat you like every other person in this department. You will receive a fair amount of work despite your status. Here is the document about the advertisement the company is going to shoot today. It's yours to handle.""
With a sneer, Annabel took the document and left. 
The others surrounded Nina again. 
""Nina, is it Marcel's shoot? Annabel is new. Don't you think she will screw it up?""
A spark of mischief shone in Nina's eyes. The face of the advertisement was Marcel Brooks‚Äîa young and bad-tempered celebrity. He was hard to please and work with. People always avoided him. She looked forward to seeing Annabel mess things up on her first day. 
As soon as Annabel got out, she went through the document that outlined the process of the advertisement. She raised her eyebrows when she saw Marcel's name in there; it was familiar. 
In the CEO's office, Rupert's assistant asked him, ""Nina Jones handed over Marcel's shoot to Miss Hewitt just now. Should I order someone to replace her?""
Marcel's elder brother was a friend of Rupert's since childhood. Everyone knew that Marcel had a bad temper. It went without saying that Annabel would suffer a lot at his hands if she worked with him today. 
Remembering what Annabel said to him this morning, Rupert finally replied, ""No, let her do it.""
He would take delight in her suffering. 
The company was in charge of everything for the shoot. Annabel and some employees went downstairs to welcome Marcel. 
A few minutes passed before a black Bentley drove into Benton Group's premises. Marcel got out wearing a pair of sunglasses. At the age of nineteen, he already had millions of fans all over the world. His fame contributed to his arrogance. He held his head up high and walked like he owned the place. 
Annabel walked up to him and extended her hand for a handshake. ""Welcome, Mr. Brooks. I'm Annabel Hewett, the person in charge of the shoot. It's my pleasure to meet you.""
Marcel didn't take her hand or exchange pleasantries. He just complained with a frown, ""It's so hot. Why didn't you bring an umbrella? Anyway, is everything all set? I don't have time to waste. By the way, buy me a cup of coffee before we begin anything. Don't get me a cheap one. I want one from that cafe downtown. They make the best...""
Marcel's words trailed off when he finally looked at the woman's face. His jaw dropped. 
""Holy moly! Annabel! Am I dreaming?""
Marcel took off his sunglasses and still looked incredulous. 
He hugged Annabel excitedly. 
""Annabel? Why are you here? You work here? When did that happen? Shouldn't you be traveling around the world now?""
Annabel stroked Marcel's head and said with a smile, ""Marc, long time no see. What did you say you wanted to drink again?""
""Nothing! I didn't say anything. What would you like to drink? I can get it for you.""
Everyone present was dumbfounded, to say the least. 
The ever-so-arrogant Marcel not only hugged Annabel but was also speaking to her politely. He even allowed her to stroke his head. 
Was this really Marcel or some clone who was passing off as him? 
Could it be that he was so respectful because Annabel was Rupert's fiancee? But he was usually arrogant in Rupert's presence. What was going on? 
The truth was that Annabel and Marcel met two years ago. 
At that time, Marcel was seventeen. He was filming in the countryside, very close to Annabel's home. 
Some thugs kidnapped him. Fortunately, Annabel saved him by chance. 
Marcel had fearfully watched her beat up the kidnappers so easily. He had thought he was going to die in captivity, but she had come to his rescue like a superwoman. 
She had invited him to her home. Much to his surprise, her home was even bigger than the mansion in Downton Abbey. 
It turned out that she was not only kind but also well-to-do. He couldn't help but hold her in high esteem. 
Chapter 5  Chivalrous Lad
The two walked into Benton Group. And the shooting went on smoothly. 
Some of the clothes weren't up to Marcel's taste. He complained about them. But when Annabel said that they were good, he immediately changed his opinion. 
He set aside his nitpicking attitude just because of her. Whenever he went out of line, Annabel's glance brought him to order. 
Marcel was intimidated by her. Asides from the fact that he respected her for saving his life, he feared that she would spank him if he annoyed her. 
It was estimated that the shoot would take five hours because of Marcel's attitude, but it took only two hours. 
Once it ended, Marcel pulled Annabel and said, ""Let's go. We have a lot of catching up to do. I'll treat you to dinner.""
""No, I can't. I'm not off duty yet!"" Annabel refused him coldly. 
Some of the employees were still on the set. They pretended to be busy, but they gossiped about the two on the spot. 
""What? Marcel offered to buy Annabel dinner but she turned him down.""
""Holy moly! What is she thinking? Doesn't she know who he is? Many girls would jump at the offer. How can she be so arrogant?""
""I wish he could take me instead. I can quit my job just to spend some time with him. Oh, Annabel is so foolish.""
Being rejected, Marcel wanted to cry. After thinking for a while, he asked, ""By the way, why did you start working here? Oh my! Did your family go bankrupt? If so, I can support you. You don't have to slave away here, okay?""
Annabel rolled her eyes and said, ""You know nothing, Marc. Now if you will excuse me...""
She then went back to work. 
Everyone who saw the scene thought Marcel would storm out in a fit of pique. To their greatest surprise, he smiled helplessly and went to the lounge to wait for Annabel until she got off work. 
By closing hour, Rupert walked out of his office and said to Annabel, ""Grandpa made a reservation at a restaurant. Let's go have dinner there.""
Rupert didn't want to, but Bruce threatened him. The man was hospitalized earlier after having a heart attack. On video call, he said, ""You must go. If you don't, I'll pull the plug on this ventilator. Do you want me to die?""
Rupert's hands were tied, so he had to agree. 
Annabel was about to reply when Marcel came in. 
""Annabel, you are off duty now, right? Can we have dinner now?""
It wasn't until Rupert coughed slightly that Marcel noticed his presence. 
""You are here, Rupert!"" he exclaimed. 
Did Annabel and Marcel know each other? Rupert looked at the two in confusion. 
Annabel, who had been silent, finally spoke. ""How about we all have dinner together?""
In the end, the three of them went to the restaurant that Bruce reserved earlier. 
During the ride, Marcel kept talking to Annabel, who replied in a friendly way from time to time. 
When they arrived, Marcel became chivalrous. He opened the door for Annabel and even pulled a chair for her. He also put food on her plate and poured her a glass of red wine. 
Rupert was relegated to the background. It was as if these two were in their own world, and he was just there to watch them. 
""By the way, you still haven't told me why you decided to work in Benton Group. Is there something between you and Rupert?""
Marcel suspected that they were involved with each other. 
Glancing at Rupert, Annabel answered, ""My grandpa asked me to work here. As for what is between us... We are engaged.""
Marcel spat out a mouthful of water. 
""You both are what? What a small world we live in! So, you are the countrywoman whom Rupert got engaged to?""
Annabel nodded casually. 
The rumor of the engagement was widespread in Douburgh, so Marcel knew about it. Since he knew about Annabel's background, he couldn't help but sigh because of how clueless the media was. 
She was indeed from the countryside, but she was far from being poor. The Hewitt family was super rich and had dozens of villas scattered around the world. 
""Are you two in love?"" Marcel looked at them in disbelief. 
""Don't get the wrong idea. We are not in love. The engagement will be canceled three months later,"" Annabel said calmly. 
Marcel breathed a sigh of relief and nodded. Without mincing words, he uttered, ""That's good. Rupert doesn't deserve you. I'm even better than him. You two are nothing alike. He's cold and boring. A marriage between the two of you would be a disaster.""
Rupert knifed the steak on his plate and chewed hard as fury brewed inside him. 
He didn't deserve Annabel? What nonsense! 
""That reminds me, Marcel. Your brother asked me to buy the car you have always wanted. He plans to give it to you. I think...""
""come on, Rupert. I didn't mean that. Can't you take a joke anymore?"" Marcel smiled awkwardly. 
They had a nice meal. After walking out of the restaurant, Annabel and Rupert bid Marcel farewell. 
""Bye, Annabel! I'll visit you whenever I'm free.""
Annabel stroked his head again as they hugged. She waved at him. ""Bye, Marc. Take care!""
She petted him as if he were Teddy, her Alaskan Malamute. 
He grunted and got into the car. On the way back, he finally complained, ""I see why you boldly said that you'll never fall in love with me. You're in love with someone else."" [Read more](https://novels-for-all.com/best-novel-platforms)",1,1742834787.0,Novelideas,0,1.0,False

Subject: Idea for Season 5 of ""You""

Hello, Netflix team and the creators of ""You""!

I am a huge fan of your show and would love to share a story idea for Season 5 that could make the plot even more intense and psychologically thrilling.

Plot Concept:

Joe Goldberg believes he has left his past behind and is now living a new life. But one day, as he walks past a caf√©, he sees Love Quinn, sitting calmly, wearing dark sunglasses, and drinking coffee. Shocked, he rushes inside‚Äîbut she's gone. On the table where she sat, there‚Äôs only a note: ""Miss me?""

Joe runs outside and spots a car driving away. Inside, he thinks he sees Love. He jumps into his own car and starts chasing it. But when the car finally stops, a different woman steps out, just someone who resembles Love.

At that moment, his phone rings‚Äîan unknown number. Joe answers, and a voice says: ""And yet, I still love you."" Then a chilling laughter echoes, and the call ends abruptly.

Just then, a random dog runs up to him. On its collar, the name ""Love"" is written. Memories flood his mind‚Äîtheir love, their fights, the moment he left her to die.

And then, his dark inner voice whispers: ""Are you really going to let this go? You must end Love.""

Now, he becomes the hunter again‚Äîbut this time, his prey is Love, someone who is smarter, more cunning, and knows him better than anyone else. A final showdown begins‚Ä¶


---

I believe this storyline would make Season 5 even more psychologically thrilling, adding an unexpected twist to Joe‚Äôs journey. It would be incredible to see him face the ghosts of his past‚Äîespecially if Love is still alive and playing the same game he once played with others.

I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for your amazing work, I can't wait for Season 5!

Best regards, [Esen]

1jiva9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimWorldReport/comments/1jiva9z/how_coffee_habits_impact_the_american_dream_of/,How Coffee Habits Impact the American Dream of Homeownership,"**Summary:** This post explores how small daily expenses like coffee can hinder the pursuit of homeownership. It highlights the systemic barriers that complicate financial stability.

**Key Excerpts:**

**TL;DR:** This post examines how daily coffee expenses can impede homeownership in the U.S., highlighting the broader economic issues that contribute to financial instability. It critiques the emphasis on individual spending choices while emphasizing the systemic barriers affecting many aspiring homeowners.

# The Cost of Coffee: A Reflection on Homeownership Dreams

In today's economy, the dream of homeownership often feels as distant as a cup of artisanal coffee, savored yet seldom within reach. Just like the average price of a specialty latte, which has soared to nearly $5 in recent years (Smith 2023), the affordability of housing has become a bitter reality for many. Historically, the post-World War II era in the United States saw a surge in homeownership as soldiers returned home and took advantage of low-interest rates and government incentives. This golden age of housing, however, stands in stark contrast to today's market, where median home prices in many urban areas have skyrocketed, leaving many potential buyers grappling with an affordability crisis (Jones 2023).

Imagine if homeowners viewed their properties through the lens of their daily coffee habits. Just as individuals might scrutinize a $5 cup of coffee and decide to brew it at home instead, many are weighing the long-term value of homeownership against the rising cost of living. Could the pursuit of homeownership be likened to a continuous cycle of caffeine dependency, keeping dreams alive yet often leading to financial fatigue? As we reflect on these challenges, it's worth asking: at what point does the aspiration for a home become a burden, and how might we redefine the dream of homeownership in an age of rising costs?

1jiva8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1jiva8x/slow_recovery_after_h_pylori_treatment_with/,Slow recovery after H. pylori treatment with anxiety in the mix,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my story and see if anyone has had similar experiences or has any advice or feedback on what I‚Äôm going through.

Starting around July 2024, I began dealing with really uncomfortable anxiety-driven nausea, mainly in specific social situations where I felt ‚Äútrapped,‚Äù like conversations I couldn‚Äôt easily exit, drive-thrus, haircuts, etc. At first, I assumed it was just anxiety mixed with a bit of acid reflux, but as time went on, the nausea became more constant. About a month ago, I got tested for H. pylori, and it came back positive.

The anxiety and nausea ended up having a big impact on both my social and work life. I started going out less, seeing fewer people, and even day-to-day things at work became harder to manage. It felt like I was constantly on edge, waiting for that sick feeling to hit.

I finished 14 days of triple therapy just over a week ago. During the antibiotics, I didn‚Äôt really adjust my diet (which I now regret), but I‚Äôve been a lot more strict since finishing. I‚Äôve been eating plain, non-acidic foods, sticking to smaller meals, taking daily probiotics, switching from coffee to gentler teas, drinking kefir to support my gut, and using antacids (Gaviscon) here and there when I felt I needed it. That‚Äôs helped a bit, but recovery still feels slow.

Last week, mornings were the worst. I‚Äôd wake up with a sudden wave of nausea that would fade after a while. I‚Äôve noticed that being on an empty stomach makes everything worse: more acid, more nausea, and more discomfort. It‚Äôs definitely been a bit of a rollercoaster, but I do feel like I‚Äôm improving little by little.

I still get spikes of anxiety-driven nausea, especially in certain situations, but they‚Äôve become less intense than before. That‚Äôs been encouraging, even though I‚Äôm not fully there yet.

If anyone‚Äôs dealt with a mix of anxiety and H. pylori symptoms, or had a slow recovery after treatment, I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing your story or any advice. I‚Äôm scheduled to retest in about 2.5 weeks, but I‚Äôm trying to manage expectations in case I still feel off by then.",1,1742834714.0,HPylori,0,0.67,False
1jiva1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jiva1g/should_i_still_approach_this_girl_or_move_on/,Should I Still Approach This Girl Or Move On?,"I am M21 and she is around my age
There‚Äôs this girl I see in the library. From day one, it felt like she noticed me‚Ä¶subtle eye contact here and there, looking away when I looked, but never really any solid sign that she‚Äôs interested. She always comes alone, leaves alone. Many times, we cross paths, and I‚Äôve noticed that she leaves around the same time I do, but that could just be a coincidence. She never looks around much, just stays focused.

I‚Äôve been wanting to approach her for a while now, but something always holds me back. Once, I was ready, but just as I stood near the exit where she usually passes, she saw me and immediately went to sit with three guys. One was sitting right next to her, and the other two stood nearby. Later, I saw her sipping coffee with another guy. Now, I know this isn‚Äôt the West where guys and girls just casually hang out here, it usually means something. I don‚Äôt want to overthink, but if she‚Äôs that high-value, why is she so open to being around all these random dudes?

The store was called Overstock. I recognized that name from the online retailer, and thought, ‚ÄúOh wow, I didn‚Äôt know they had physical locations! Let‚Äôs go there!‚Äù

After this whole situation I found out that this store isn‚Äôt affiliated with the online store. It just has the same name. I wish I would‚Äôve known this before, but oh well.

The woman who sold me the furniture was very nice. I asked, ‚ÄúDo you guys do delivery?‚Äù 

She replied, ‚ÄúYeah, we have a guy that does that!‚Äù

So I pay. They ask when I want the furniture delivered. I say Saturday, two weeks from now.


That Saturday, no one showed. I called shortly before closing, asking about the delivery. A woman, who I assume from a bad review was the manager as I met this person and the details matched up, she answered and said,

‚ÄúThey were supposed to call you about a flat tire, he‚Äôll be there tomorrow‚Äù

I said okay that‚Äôs fine.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not with a company‚Äù was her reply.

Two minutes later she calls back, and her tone has completely changed.

TLDR (AI generated summary):

Two weeks ago, the user purchased furniture from a local Overstock store and scheduled delivery. On the scheduled day, no one showed up. When they called, they were told the delivery was delayed due to a flat tire and would arrive the next day. The next morning, the store informed them that the delivery driver had quit, and they might need to pick up the furniture themselves.  

Later, the store found a replacement but refused to provide his name or any identifying details. When the user questioned this, the manager became defensive, hung up, then called back claiming the new driver no longer felt comfortable making the delivery. The user was left with the choice of picking up the furniture themselves or getting a refund.  

Frustrated with the lack of professionalism, the user opted for a refund but is now anxious about confronting the manager in person. ",2,1742834580.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

When it comes to drip coffee, I'm not sure there's a better duo. It took me a while (2-3 mos) to appreciate how great of a grinder the KM5 really is. The KBGV on the other hand I fell in love with immediately. 

The KM5 was my first electric burr grinder. Previously I had used a Normcore Grinder V3 (great hand grinder btw). There was a bit of a learning curve with the KM5. At first static and retention made it seem nearly unusable. I ordered an atomizer spray bottle and that quickly remedied my static issues. Thanks to this sub I learned the lid can be flipped and used as a bellows to clear out stuck grounds. This usually amounts to 0.5-1g being pushed through.   
  
That leaves my only real complaint:  the hopper bottom is just too shallow. I use a stiff brush that came with my Normcore grinder to push any stray beans or kick back into the burrs. For a while I used my finger but that felt unsanitary. I asked myself ""what would my guest think?"" I don't have a solution for the hopper beyond this. Perhaps it has to do with the rate at which the beans enter the burrs, but I would love to see a version of the hopper with a steeper bottom.   
  
I am strongly considering finding a replacement switch that does not have a spring back feature. If you look, I'm sure you can find multiple post where I have commented the switch doesn't bother me but after daily use over the past 5 months, I realized there's a lot of things I could be doing while grinding beans if I wasn't stuck holding a switch. By no means a deal breaker but should make for a fun little project. 

The KBGV had a much less turbulent learning period. Out of the box I was brewing delicious coffee. I found pretty quickly, against the user manual recommendations, I prefer to brew with an 18.8:1 ratio. 26.6g to 500ml for, what I consider, a pretty strong cup. I love the simplicity and reliability of a Moccamaster brewer. ",2,1742834558.0,Moccamaster,2,1.0,False

# Consolation Cup - Final places

First things first, there are a limited number of places available to get your team in the draw for the first round of the Consolation Cup.

**Deadline is Saturday 5th April @ 12:30pm (BST)**. Conveniently, this is also the deadline for GW31 so there still time, but first-come-first-served.

All you need to do is send me your FPL Team ID (by chat or comment below), which you can find in the URL of your Gameweek History page on the FPL website.

The draw and tournament bracket will be made prior to the GW32 deadline, when the first round will be played, culminating in a final in GW38.

The Champions Cup Final will also take place in GW38, but that won't kick off until GW34. For those still in contention to qualify for the Champions Cup, discover your chances in the update below.

As per usual, all past, and present, Stages can be found in the¬†[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/view?gid=1949867961).

# Stage 4

# [Tier 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=879186598#gid=879186598)

**DIVISION 1**

At the top of Tier 1, u/_13characters is romping clear and will claim the Stage 5 title. They are on 4x wins already, and no-one else can catch-up. All this success is also serving them well in the Overall Rankings, flying high in the Top 5k.

Between the rest, it's a case of fighting for survival, with a place in the final stage up for grabs. Relegation means Elimination at this late stage.

u/ZAK5UMA, u/theseane, and u/Fooicus are all on 2x wins each, with u/Andrew643521 and u/leosondek on 1x each.

The bottom two must get a win to have a sliver of a chance of staying alive int he competition, but of course, they play each other, meaning at least one of them will be out come the end of GW30.

As for the rest, a win will certainly secure their place, and even a draw will be enough.

u/Fooicus can survive with a loss, but needs u/Andrew643521 to falter in their attempts.

It's a similar scenario for u/theseane who has previously been beaten by u/leosondek, so they can also lose pending that result at the bottom of the table.

That means our Champions Cup top qualifier u/ZAK5UMA is safe and will be joining u/_13characters in the Stage 6 finale.

https://preview.redd.it/i88io6apenqe1.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e24a573df6e24fab28c81708750ce69b0230d6f

**DIVISION 2**

u/Acrobatic_Employ_798 is also flying high and unreachable at the top of Division 2, meaning they will take that title and confirm their place in the Stage 6 finale. It should also cement their place in the Champions Cup draw.

u/Dioulio and u/Name19389 lead the way for the final survival place, each with 2x wins. However, the former has a crucial tie from GW27 that put them in pole position.

That GW27 result actually narrows the field for survival from the rest of the pack. Given u/EpiKnightz and u/FanFareApp cannot catch-up, they are eliminated from FPL Swiss at the second-to-last hurdle.

u/Justchillin1123 is the remaining contender, and a win is necessary. However, it's highly unlikely to matter as it would take them level with u/Dioulio on wins and H2H, but the Overall Rank tie-breaker weighs heavily in the latter's favour.

https://preview.redd.it/rsq4iamqenqe1.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=812d31cf85d0b24f6d9ed6752732519084d4f05e

# [Tier 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=784690583#gid=784690583)

**DIVISION 1**

In Tier 2, u/bb53040 and u/Vegetable_Design8330 are both on 3x wins at the top, but it's actually the latter who holds the H2H advantage after they played in GW29. A win for u/Vegetable_Design8330 will secure the title but anything less and u/bb53040 can take the glory.

At the bottom, u/sparrowhawk73 is eliminated on 4x losses thus far, and is unable to escape the bottom two.

As for the rest, there's a mix of unrealised potential and impending despair. They are all on 2x wins each, so with results going in their favour elsewhere, primarily if the top two both lose, then a title win could be on the cards. We could have 4x Managers on 3x wins each.

On the flip-side, with u/Long-Seaworthiness50 and u/pa_ra_dox playing against each other, only H2H can save the loser if u/coolBballer also loses.

In this scenario, if u/Long-Seaworthiness50 beats u/pa_ra_dox, they are safe. For u/pa_ra_dox to then survive, they need u/coolBballer to lose for H2H to be in their favour.

https://preview.redd.it/3nadf9rrenqe1.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff9ab73f67be2f0d2e26987c91fecef83e116d4a

**DIVISION 2**

u/FaustRPeggi is still going strong, showing incredible resilience in the face of Elimination. I've lost track of how many consecutive Promotions and Survivals they've gone through, but it's happened again with 4x wins and a chance at winning Tier 2 in the final stage.

Joining them in that feat will be u/wo27, who is also on 4x wins. They play each other in GW30 to decide who will take the Division 2 title. Both are safe in Champions Cup Qualification, so this is just a case of adding to the silverware on the virtual mantlepiece.

With all that said, it means u/QuantumParadox_27, u/CardozoSmash, u/NielsRandomShirt and u/FinnMundy7 are all eliminated from FPL Swiss.

https://preview.redd.it/dk26qorsenqe1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c41b3749ecd3c2ef6dfb8d6e92b879c440e23c1

# [Tier 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=2083037900#gid=2083037900)

**DIVISION 1**

In the lower Tier 3, things could get a little more interesting than we've seen elsewhere.

u/thepalegreenpants and u/fusrohdaba are on 3x wins each, and play against each other in the final match. Regardless of that result, one of the two will take the title. as no-one will be able to catch them both, even if it ends in a draw.

After that, it becomes a matter of survival between the remaining four.

u/pauld95 and u/Gloomy-Strawberry808 have the advantage of the extra win so far, but they each play individual matches. Should either win, they are safe.

On the other hand, should either of u/WaningCynicism or u/eglantinel win, it'll come down to H2H as well as the other result.

If u/WaningCynicism wins, that should be enough, as that's a crucial H2H win on the border.

If u/eglantinel wins, that's also a crucial H2H win.

If both win, then we go to a 4-way H2H decider to determine who will stay to challenge for the FPL Swiss Tier 3 in Stage 6, and who will be eliminated.

https://preview.redd.it/pt8t2pptenqe1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebba12d8443bb0288d8fa9cf6b5adc1a867e499f

**DIVISION 2**

At the bottom of the pile, we come to Tier 3 Division 2, where u/the_Vegetabull leads with 4x wins and takes the Stage 5 title while they're at it. They are safe from elimination, and will progress to Division 1 to battle it out for reigning glory.

u/_LilDuck stands in good stead to join them, with 3x wins, and ahead of others on only two. A win will seal it, as will a draw. A loss, however, means that u/Gilez_89 will have the opportunity to leapfrog onto the lily-pad of hope.

But wait! What's that you say? H2H?

Oh yes, the bane of every FPL Swiss Manager at one stage or another. Despite any efforts, survival is out of reach for u/Gilez_89  after they lost to u/_LilDuck back in GW26.

Unfortunately, this all spells elimination for u/FPL_06, u/Mundanewisdom99 and u/docvampirina.

https://preview.redd.it/1guf23duenqe1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=2799bbdf83f7c0e17d17364314b64f2f16b4a751

That wraps up the scenarios for Stage 5. Keep your eyes peeled to see how things transpire after GW30 concludes after the International Break.

# [Champions Cup Qualifiers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/view?gid=1233273866#gid=1233273866)

You can check out the rankings as things stand over on the spreadsheet (linked on the subtitle, or in the links at the bottom of this post).

As mentioned in previous posts, we are guaranteed to have 32 qualifiers, meaning we will be starting the Champions Cup in GW34. Stage 5 is the final opportunity to be in with a shout of Cup glory to go along with League success. Anyone in the Qualifier table but outside of the Top 32 will be Seeded and ideally receiving a bye in the first round of the Consolation Cup, but that is pending final numbers.

**REMINDER: If you would like to claim one of the remaining places in the Consolation Cup, send me your FPL ID. First-come, first-served.**

As usual, all links can be found below to each Stage and Tier, as well as previous posts.

If I have missed anything, or you've noticed something not quite right with the above, please do let me know as soon as I can as mistakes may not be able to be rectified in an ideal manner, if at all, once the GW starts.

Best of luck to everyone.

1jiv2lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1jiv2lx/am_i_experiencing_symptoms_of_ptsd_and_should_i/,Am I experiencing symptoms of PTSD and should I seek professional help,"I‚Äôm a 23 years old guy soon 24, thats recently been made aware that i might have some mild symptoms of ptsd

TRIGGER WARNING: abuse, physical violence and psychological abuse

I‚Äôll start out by saying that im sorry if this doesn‚Äôt belong here, but im really looking for advice

I‚Äôll share my story, and you can read it if you want to get more context. The most important parts, though, are the symptoms I think I‚Äôm experiencing, which are at the end of the post.

The symptoms started appearing for me very recently, after I ended all contact with my abusive ex, and I‚Äôm afraid they might affect the relationship I‚Äôm in now.

It all began in April 2023 when I started talking to a guy, 24, whom I thought was really nice, at the time my last grandparent had passed away, only 4 months after my other grandparent. At the time, I hadn‚Äôt come out yet, but I saw an opportunity with the upcoming pride event in my city. I came out because of him‚Äîhe showed genuine interest in me and told me he saw a future with me. My coming out was full of support from friends and family, and I didn‚Äôt receive any negative feedback.

However, after I came out, everything changed. He wanted just a ""friends with benefits"" situation. He became distant, and when I asked to hang out, he would cancel or outright refuse, most times calling me clingy. Eventually, after a while, he would come back to me, telling me he missed me, and we would hang out again. This cycle repeated for a long time. And even though he was the one who wanted a friends-with-benefits arrangement, he mostly treated it like a relationship, which messed with my head.

At that time, I was larger and had very low self-esteem, which made it even harder to leave. When he came back, he made me feel loved again, and those were the only times I felt loved. But sometimes, he would tear me down. He once told me I had a ""spine like a worm,"" and he made cruel comparisons about people like service workers, saying things like, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really hot, and I bet he‚Äôs so much smarter than you.‚Äù He made other hurtful jokes about my intelligence and appearance, which made me feel awful. Every time I confronted him about it‚Äîtelling him that, even if it was a joke, it wasn‚Äôt funny and it hurt‚Äîhis response was always, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way, but you‚Äôre overreacting.‚Äù

Because of his terrible behavior and my low self-esteem, I didn‚Äôt have the strength to leave him. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt worth more than that. As a result, I developed a mild eating disorder, and almost stopped eating, while simultaneously walking 13 km (8 miles) every day. From June to August, I went from 115 kg (253 lbs) to 80 kg (176 lbs), and it took a huge toll on my body. I was losing my mind, I was depressed, and convinced I was the problem. All he could say was, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being dramatic,‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too clingy,‚Äù and he‚Äôd threaten to end things. But he always kept me around, breadcrumbing me, just in case he wanted/needed my love and affection. 

One time, I spilled a glass of water on his coffee table. When I got up to get a paper towel, he immediately reacted in anger, yelling and grunting. As I reached for the paper towel, he pushed me aside and hit me, with all of his strength, in the chest. I lost my breath for a few seconds, and kinda blacked out in disbelief. I stood there, silent, watching in terror as he wipe away the water. When I told him it wasn‚Äôt okay, he said, ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôm sorry, but I did it because you didn‚Äôt apologize immediately.‚Äù

Our relationship eventually shifted to just ‚Äúfriends‚Äù per his request, and I started seeing other people. But as soon as I did, he‚Äôd show interest again. He‚Äôd touch me weirdly, caress me, and send suggestive photos, which made me even more confused. I was blinded by my love for him, so I excused his behavior.

At one point during oktober, we had a deeper conversation where he apologized for everything he‚Äôd done to me, blaming it on his childhood trauma and past relationships.

Fast forward to December. He started becoming more affectionate, complimenting me, caressing me, and holding me‚Äîeverything I‚Äôd wanted from the beginning. Then, in mid-January, he asked me to be his partner, and I said yes, as it was everything I had dreamed of. After that that he went to China for the whole month of February, where i discovered he had made a new Snapchat account, to talk at other people and get nudes. I discovered it  and my heart dropped, when I called him out on it he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I don‚Äôt know why I do these things‚Äù and me being naive forgave him. But when he came home, he became distant again. The relationship came to an abrupt end in early April, just a week after my birthday, when I asked him what was wrong, and he said he didn‚Äôt love me anymore. He claimed it wasn‚Äôt a breakup, so I went along with it.

He never officially broke up with me but slowly returned to using dating apps and reverted to his old ways. From April to July, our relationship was on and off. One time, I got so fed up with his treatment that we had a long conversation, and he said, ‚ÄúI can see myself in you and you remind me of me back then, and I know exactly how you feel. I was in the same situation.‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúSo why would you put me in this situation? Can‚Äôt you see why I‚Äôm scared of ending up like you?‚Äù This continued until August, when I finally moved on from our romantic relationship and focused purely on the friendship aspect, at this point at had done a lot of rediscovering of myself.

In late August, I matched with a sweet guy on Tinder who treats me right. We‚Äôve been going strong ever since. I kept my friendship with my ex during this time and told my current partner that we were just friends, and there was no need to worry‚Äîit would never be anything more.
Fast forward to November. My ex texted me a very explicit photo, drunk, with the message, ‚ÄúSorry, just a little horny right now.‚Äù My heart sank. I told him it was the most disgusting thing he could do to me after everything I‚Äôd been through, and I cut him off. I immediately told my partner what happened and that I had cut my ex out of my life. My ex then sent me multiple apologetic messages, trying to make it up to me. He played the ‚Äúeveryone leaves me‚Äù card in his messages. One day, I texted him and told him he had to stop contacting me because every time I saw his name on my screen or saw him in public, I wished the worst for him.
The last message he sent was a long apology, where he essentially said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, my childhood trauma showed in my behavior towards you.‚Äù In other words, apologizing to me for having a bad childhood.

That‚Äôs the story and of course there is more to it, he did a lot of awful things but this sums it up just a bit.

But here‚Äôs how it affects my everyday life now.

I‚Äôm scared of intimacy now because, back then, it was a means of ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù to keep him close.
Sexualizing myself though I didn‚Äôt want to, because other wise he wouldn‚Äôt need me.

I think about how he treated me almost every day because it was so damaging.

Sometimes, if I go to places we went to, I‚Äôm taken back to that time.

If I play a game, it triggers memories of him.

When I look in the mirror, I‚Äôm reminded of it.
Sometimes, I‚Äôm reminded of the time he hit me.

I‚Äôm always afraid of speaking up because I‚Äôm scared of being told I‚Äôm overreacting.

I have terrible dreams about him, where I‚Äôm constantly running away from him.

I‚Äôm always wary of my surroundings, afraid of running into him. It happened once in public 
transport, and I had what felt like a panic attack.

My mind is often preoccupied, thinking about all the things he did, wanting him to suffer the way I did. It‚Äôs happening more and more, and I hate it.

Even when I just go to lie down for a quick nap, I sometimes relive these moments. And it‚Äôs mentally draining, to have to see his face every time I close my eyes.

I‚Äôm genuinely scared that these things will ruin my current relationship because I don‚Äôt want him to have this effect on me, and I refuse to be like him.

I don‚Äôt want to claim that I have PTSD, since it might just be a response from my nervous system after living on high alert for almost a 1 1/2. but I‚Äôm looking for advice from others who may have been in a similar situation.

In the past, I went to my doctor because I didn‚Äôt want to live anymore. But at the time, he dismissed me, because I didn‚Äôt meet the requirements to get a psychologist. So, before I even think about asking him about PTSD, I just want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience and if they have any tips or words that can help me.

Bit of context.

Me and my partner 35M had a argument yesterday about his parents babysitting.
I turned around being 6 weeks Postpartum and said I didn't want anyone babysitting atm as I can't be without her, I had a c section and I combined fed for about week 5 and then went fully forumla because I started stuffing from postnatal depression, on top of that my wound is infected typically so have alot going on. I'm also the main carer my partner went back to work on week 2.

Anyway my partner went on by saying I was selfish for not letting them babysit which really got my guard up !! Because I'm far from selfish. I let them come to hospital before my own parents and the next day and that whole week! They have been round loads and we have been round to their house loads, I'm not stopping them from seeing her this was just I didn't want them to babysit as I'm not ready to leave her.
I was then made to feel so guilty about it by my partner.
He then started talking through the baby to get to me which fully annoyed me. And then started calling me crazy because at this point I wanted to pull my hair out because he was honestly being a vile human!
 He undermined me as a mother and told me what he is going to do with our daughter like take her round there anyway and then say that they are babysitting within the next few months and he won't be asking me. He was using gaslighting and language to make me react.
I just want to add they have a grandson already his sisters son. But this is his first child. So understand they are excited but he still needs to respect my descions it's not its been a long time since shes been born.

So anyway that morning was like hell and I got that frustrated I nudged his shoulder when he was standing close to me. I said most women would of slapped you by now. Because the way he was talking to me they would have.
However later on in the day I apologised for that and told him he was doing that gaslighting thing and the fact all I do is look after his child and 6 weeks ago gave birth to his child I was really annoyed he was disrespecting me like that he knows what I'm currently going through with postnatal depression and everything.

I went out with my mum I had to get out the house for a while with my daughter.
He then picks me up later yet every sentence he says little digs to me and starts annoying me. Like I was already angry at him from early but instead of him apologising he tells me he hates me atm he doesn't care if I don't come back and things that are really really untrue to who I am. He did it because he knew it wasn't true. He focused on the way I reacted instead of why did I act that way! Because he caused it.
He couldn't just turn around and say 'you know what I said some bad things and I aplogise how can I make it up to you' 

So we argue again he turns around and calls me controlling because he didn't go to a stag do yesterday, I never told him not to go! I asked him because I'm only 6 weeks pp and got infected wound and suffering from PND if he could stay home and he said yes that's fine! (It was a while drive away anyway) this happened a few weeks ago so I thanked him for that and said thank you for respecting my feelings. It's the only thing I've ever asked him to not go too!!! So the fact he gets everything on tap and his way this made me extremely mad he called me controlling! Because I'm not, I'm also not selfish! Like I couldn't be further from i put everyone before myself, I feel so dragged down half the time because if I'm not looking after baby I'm thinking of his best interests. So I don't know how he can say I'm those things.

So we argue more and he then loses it , throws something on the floor and then grabs me by the shoulders and shakes me while moving me, for a good amount of time he didn't let go anytime soon.

I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong because I was arguing back but I was only telling him why I was annoyed and if I'm honest it all started because of him in the morning I told him If he couldn't see what he was doing to me something is wrong! Any other man would of respected the mothers view.
I said you can disrespect me as a person but you do NOT disrespect me as a mother. 

I've still had no aplaogy nothing , he told me he hated me and he also said multiple times about not coming back home yet the baby is welcome too.

I asked him last night if he though the way he treated me who had just given birth hormones everywhere , still heeling and suffering from postnatal depression acceptable behaviour ? He never replied.
He knows I'm in alot of pain he knows I'm still healing yet he grabbed me and shook me and while he was shaking me pushing me .
He said it was to get me to get away from the baby because I was being irrational ?!?!?! Can you believe 
That!!! After everything i went through he turns round and says I'm irrational! When all I ever do is care for his daughter I've been told I'm doing ans amazing job she's absolutely perfect and happy and gaining weight and content. And never once has he told me in doing a good job.
And for a man to treat me like that when a I do is care for him and our daughter is horrible. 

He has sex on tap whenever he wants it.
I make him lunch and coffee even though it's hard for me to even go to the toilet with a 6 week old attached to me.. 
He travels for work so he gets breaks.
I just feel really hurt with all the lies he was saying because he was more describing himself more than me.

Basically is it my fault he grabbed me because I nudged his shoulder because he was emotionally abusing me and my hormones are everywhere anyway.
I just feel like I'm just as bad :( but atleast I apologised.",3,1742833409.0,domesticviolence,0,0.81,False

I (21F) was walking down the road a few weeks ago, a guy (28M) came up to me while I was walking and asked for  my number. He commented how beautiful I am, asked me a little about myself what I was studying etc. He told me a little about him as well when I asked him. He said he was from Turkey. For reference I am from and living in Northern Europe. I was really hesitant so I didn‚Äôt give him my number but took his. After looking him up and verifying what he told me, I messaged him. We start texting and he was messaging me everyday. I am in university so it was difficult to message him all the time when he was texting me. We continued and he constantly asked when I would be available for a date. I wasn‚Äôt available during the weekdays as I have school. 
Also, Ramadan is talking place at the moment so he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to eat during the daytime if we met, but he still seemed keen to meet me. 
Eventually, we arrange a date for Sunday (yesterday) for a walk and coffee. 
On Saturday he calls me and after talking on the phone for the first time, asks if I want to have dinner in the evening. I had no plans so I said ok. We arranged to get food at a place near my house. 

We also talked about ourselves while on the phone, he asked about previous relationships and I answered and asked him too. He told me his previous relationship was 6 months ago and it was 1 year long. He also asked me specifically ifI am a jealous person in relationships. I said no. 
I asked why did he ask that and he said his last girlfriend was very very jealous so he doesn‚Äôt like that. 
I concluded then that he must not be jealous or anything like that‚Ä¶
We made the plans for 7pm but I ended up being delayed at my house so we didn‚Äôt meet until 8.( I kept him updated and apologised profusely for all this, he said it was no problem. )
Also, I didn‚Äôt have him pick me up from my house as I didn‚Äôt know who this man was, I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal and it was my first time having a fate with him. 

We had dinner, it was fine, talked about ourselves, our family, school, work. General things. I told him I lived in my family house. He asked questions about my family and school. 
I also had told him about myself when we spoke on the phone. 
He was friendly and paid for dinner and seemed happy about the meal. 
He dropped me back where he collected me. 
I told him I would confirm the time for the date on Sunday with him as we hadn‚Äôt figured out the exact time. 


Yesterday (Sunday) he texted asking about what time suited. 
I said I was going to be delayed by the same problem as yesterday so It would be later than expected. 

I met him at the same place as Saturday. We got in the car and he drove me down the road and had little chit chat. I also apologised again for the unexpected problems.  

He then pulled over, at the start of this convo he asked my age and I asked his to clarify things, I‚Äôm 21 and he‚Äôs 28. I thought he might be younger and he thought I was a bit older. He asked me more  about my family and if he could see a picture of them. I said ok. I don‚Äôt really have any photos of my whole family on my phone, other then photos from weddings, individual photos, photos with each sibling etc. 
I explained that to him and showed him some photos that I did have. 
I was also hesitant to show him photos as I don‚Äôt know this man. 

He went on to say how he was uncomfortable moving forward and is suspicious and feels like I‚Äôm lying to him. 

I was gobsmacked and felt like it came out of nowhere as this was only the second time we had spoken in person.

I was so confused and asked why he was suspicious, he said I should have more photos of my family on my phone and he wants to see them, he also said that he didn‚Äôt think I lived where I said I lived. I explained I did but I didn‚Äôt want him to come to my house because I don‚Äôt know him well yet. I am very honest so I was shocked where this was coming from. He insinuated that I didn‚Äôt really live with my parents and I was lying about that. 
I ended up showing him my id for proof of address, lots of photos of my parents, my family, my pets my friends. I showed him a photo I took of my brother with our dog TAKEN THE NIGHT BEFORE. 
He said he still didn‚Äôt believe me. 

I was so confused. 
He then went on about how I‚Äôm definitely hiding something because I am so shocked and seem to be trying to ‚Äòprove something‚Äô. üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´
This was all in his car after he had pulled over. We were meant to get a drink and a nice walk. 
I then reasoned with him that I believed his story yet I hadn‚Äôt any proof, he has seen more proof of me and my life than I had him yet he still didn‚Äôt believe me for some reason. I would have never even asked to see his family, I just believed him. 
I asked why he though I would lie about that? And he didn‚Äôt have an answer. I asked if he had any trust issues or feels like he‚Äôs ready for a relationship and he said he felt what he is saying is justified and needs to express it. 
The more I tried to convince him, the less he seemed to believe. ..
I felt like I was being interrogated the whole time. 
I couldn‚Äôt believe it and then said ‚Äò oh well would you show me your family? You haven‚Äôt shown me anything yet but I am meant to trust you‚Äô he then said he wouldn‚Äôt be showing me because he didn‚Äôt trust me. 
He drove me back to where he dropped me before, I stayed in the car and he let me know he would think about things but might not want to see me again. I ended up showing this man, my family, my id for PROOF OF ADDRESS, my university app to show him I actually was a student, and he still seemed unsure. I was so confused. I asked if this was made up and maybe there was another reason he wouldn‚Äôt want to see me again? Maybe I‚Äôm not attractive to him? He said no, he found me absolutely gorgeous. HE THEN TRIED TO GET ME TO KISS HIM. It was very weird. Like why would you want to kiss me if you think I‚Äôm lying to you? When I expressed even more confusion for him trying to kiss me after him being so adamantly dissatisfied with me, he told me it is normal, as if we were in a relationship together and had a disagreement, he would be direct like this, clarify things and then want to kiss me. We hadn‚Äôt clarified anything as he still wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the proof I showed him and was getting ready to leave his car.He  then also talked to me about sex and how attractive he found me, I was surprised by this as I was aware he was fasting for Ramadan at the same moment. He asked if I was attracted to him as I didn‚Äôt seem to express that. I reassured him and told him again I wouldn‚Äôt have gone out with him if I didn‚Äôt feel that way. He then again suggested we kiss and said it was ok as it‚Äôs the second date. I told him not today. 
I ended up leaving his car and told him I would give him time to think, after showing him evidence of my whole existence. He told me he will think more once he finally eats and maybe he will be able to think better then. 


So that is my story. I am surprised about this, is this a red flag? Am I a red flag? 

I just thought it was a bit strange as I automatically believed him and didn‚Äôt end up seeing 1 photo as evidence of what he told me, I showed him proof of my whole life and he didn‚Äôt believe me. Thoughts? Is this because he is Turkish? Maybe it is a cultural difference. I don‚Äôt want to seem ignorant but I am genuinely confused,Is this normal for Muslim men? Am I missing something here? Maybe I am just autistic.",1,1742833284.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Strained my back of all things cleaning. I've felt that lower left miscle tighten (im a lefty so favor my left )before but just ignored it. 

Welp this time it tightened,i ignored it went to turn and mop. Felt a small pop and was in agony. Felt sharpness in my spine and muscle spasms on the left.

 Did video doc appt cause it hurt really bad to walk and wasn't getting any better 5 hrs later. Er ride would havw been 45 mins, so figured id try that first. 

She ask if I had any numbness,tingling,or bowl and bladder incontinence, as I guess could be from a bulging disk or more serious injury,etc. That was a a negative, told her about sharp pains in spine,muscle spasms when moving and she prescribed me prednisone and cyclobenzaprine and said they should work fast to get me better. Said if I get any other symptoms goto er. Also said avoid ice and do just heat which is ironic as i did ice and  and it made it worse 

Got doc note for the week off (I'm agency and had to cancel all my shifts, but w out a note like any job they count against you). Using a walker to help get around and meds def helping w spasms.

 Gist is prob take up stretching or yoga after this. Don't ignore any tight muscles people like i did and i brushed it off for months when it would tighten!!!

 I'm literally walking like an old person w a walker and in agony just to walk to bathroom to pee. I can't even lift a coffee cup w out pain or do simple shit !! So i wanted my story to be a warning to take care of yourself and im only 43yo...lol",2,1742833131.0,cna,2,1.0,False

He loves me with all he has, the amount of time and presence he has in this relationship. 
Idk if it is a relationship, we haven‚Äôt named it. 
We haven‚Äôt even met actually. But the things we have talked and done on text is amaze balls. 
From emotional mature conversations to sexting (made me so comfortable i initiate it everyday lol) .

He chose to stay by me everyday thru thick and thin. And here i am telling the world how lucky i am to have him. 
On day 18th probably he sent me this cute parcel of the things i never knew he noticed. The coffee he saw i loved, a cute little teddy so that i dont feel alone, a lip balm because i am always chapped. Candles because i am an aesthetic girly. 
Big ass love letter that made me cry. üò≠
He loved me when he didn‚Äôt even know how pretty i am. 
He made me prettier by not lusting me and now i lust over him haha.  
There hasn‚Äôt been a day or an hour i don‚Äôt think of him. I might hurt him unintentionally. But i don‚Äôt mean to. This is a guy who can do any fucking thing for you. 
Hold you down till tears stop rolling through your eyes. Holds your stomach till it stops paining. Sends me chocolates every other day.
 How can i not adore this hell of a man? 
 He made me calmer he made me less entitled. I do things which i never thought of doin for any man, he made me hate men less. Thats a fuckin win.
The traumas i have carried, he handles them delicately. He doesn‚Äôt have a bone in him which ‚Äòd hurt me.

1jiulmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jiulmw/is_this_normal_what_should_i_do/,Is this normal? What should I do?,"I (21F) was walking down the road a few weeks ago, a guy (28M) came up to me while I was walking and asked for  my number. He commented how beautiful I am, asked me a little about myself what I was studying etc. He told me a little about him as well when I asked him. He said he was from Turkey. For reference I am from and living in Northern Europe. I was really hesitant so I didn‚Äôt give him my number but took his. After looking him up and verifying what he told me, I messaged him. We start texting and he was messaging me everyday. I am in university so it was difficult to message him all the time when he was texting me. We continued and he constantly asked when I would be available for a date. I wasn‚Äôt available during the weekdays as I have school. 
Also, Ramadan is talking place at the moment so he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to eat during the daytime if we met, but he still seemed keen to meet me. 
Eventually, we arrange a date for Sunday (yesterday) for a walk and coffee. 
On Saturday he calls me and after talking on the phone for the first time, asks if I want to have dinner in the evening. I had no plans so I said ok. We arranged to get food at a place near my house. 

We also talked about ourselves while on the phone, he asked about previous relationships and I answered and asked him too. He told me his previous relationship was 6 months ago and it was 1 year long. He also asked me specifically ifI am a jealous person in relationships. I said no. 
I asked why did he ask that and he said his last girlfriend was very very jealous so he doesn‚Äôt like that. 
I concluded then that he must not be jealous or anything like that‚Ä¶
We made the plans for 7pm but I ended up being delayed at my house so we didn‚Äôt meet until 8.( I kept him updated and apologised profusely for all this, he said it was no problem. )
Also, I didn‚Äôt have him pick me up from my house as I didn‚Äôt know who this man was, I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal and it was my first time having a fate with him. 

We had dinner, it was fine, talked about ourselves, our family, school, work. General things. I told him I lived in my family house. He asked questions about my family and school. 
I also had told him about myself when we spoke on the phone. 
He was friendly and paid for dinner and seemed happy about the meal. 
He dropped me back where he collected me. 
I told him I would confirm the time for the date on Sunday with him as we hadn‚Äôt figured out the exact time. 


Yesterday (Sunday) he texted asking about what time suited. 
I said I was going to be delayed by the same problem as yesterday so It would be later than expected. 

I met him at the same place as Saturday. We got in the car and he drove me down the road and had little chit chat. I also apologised again for the unexpected problems.  

He then pulled over, at the start of this convo he asked my age and I asked his to clarify things, I‚Äôm 21 and he‚Äôs 28. I thought he might be younger and he thought I was a bit older. He asked me more  about my family and if he could see a picture of them. I said ok. I don‚Äôt really have any photos of my whole family on my phone, other then photos from weddings, individual photos, photos with each sibling etc. 
I explained that to him and showed him some photos that I did have. 
I was also hesitant to show him photos as I don‚Äôt know this man. 

He went on to say how he was uncomfortable moving forward and is suspicious and feels like I‚Äôm lying to him. 

I was gobsmacked and felt like it came out of nowhere as this was only the second time we had spoken in person.

I was so confused and asked why he was suspicious, he said I should have more photos of my family on my phone and he wants to see them, he also said that he didn‚Äôt think I lived where I said I lived. I explained I did but I didn‚Äôt want him to come to my house because I don‚Äôt know him well yet. I am very honest so I was shocked where this was coming from. He insinuated that I didn‚Äôt really live with my parents and I was lying about that. 
I ended up showing him my id for proof of address, lots of photos of my parents, my family, my pets my friends. I showed him a photo I took of my brother with our dog TAKEN THE NIGHT BEFORE. 
He said he still didn‚Äôt believe me. 

I was so confused. 
He then went on about how I‚Äôm definitely hiding something because I am so shocked and seem to be trying to ‚Äòprove something‚Äô. üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´
This was all in his car after he had pulled over. We were meant to get a drink and a nice walk. 
I then reasoned with him that I believed his story yet I hadn‚Äôt any proof, he has seen more proof of me and my life than I had him yet he still didn‚Äôt believe me for some reason. I would have never even asked to see his family, I just believed him. 
I asked why he though I would lie about that? And he didn‚Äôt have an answer. I asked if he had any trust issues or feels like he‚Äôs ready for a relationship and he said he felt what he is saying is justified and needs to express it. 
The more I tried to convince him, the less he seemed to believe. ..
I felt like I was being interrogated the whole time. 
I couldn‚Äôt believe it and then said ‚Äò oh well would you show me your family? You haven‚Äôt shown me anything yet but I am meant to trust you‚Äô he then said he wouldn‚Äôt be showing me because he didn‚Äôt trust me. 
He drove me back to where he dropped me before, I stayed in the car and he let me know he would think about things but might not want to see me again. I ended up showing this man, my family, my id for PROOF OF ADDRESS, my university app to show him I actually was a student, and he still seemed unsure. I was so confused. I asked if this was made up and maybe there was another reason he wouldn‚Äôt want to see me again? Maybe I‚Äôm not attractive to him? He said no, he found me absolutely gorgeous. HE THEN TRIED TO GET ME TO KISS HIM. It was very weird. Like why would you want to kiss me if you think I‚Äôm lying to you? When I expressed even more confusion for him trying to kiss me after him being so adamantly dissatisfied with me, he told me it is normal, as if we were in a relationship together and had a disagreement, he would be direct like this, clarify things and then want to kiss me. We hadn‚Äôt clarified anything as he still wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the proof I showed him and was getting ready to leave his car.He  then also talked to me about sex and how attractive he found me, I was surprised by this as I was aware he was fasting for Ramadan at the same moment. He asked if I was attracted to him as I didn‚Äôt seem to express that. I reassured him and told him again I wouldn‚Äôt have gone out with him if I didn‚Äôt feel that way. He then again suggested we kiss and said it was ok as it‚Äôs the second date. I told him not today. 
I ended up leaving his car and told him I would give him time to think, after showing him evidence of my whole existence. He told me he will think more once he finally eats and maybe he will be able to think better then. 


So that is my story. I am surprised about this, is this a red flag? Am I a red flag? 

I just thought it was a bit strange as I automatically believed him and didn‚Äôt end up seeing 1 photo as evidence of what he told me, I showed him proof of my whole life and he didn‚Äôt believe me. Thoughts? Is this because he is Turkish? Maybe it is a cultural difference. I don‚Äôt want to seem ignorant but I am genuinely confused,Is this normal for Muslim men? Am I missing something here? Maybe I am just autistic.",1,1742833039.0,Advice,3,1.0,False
