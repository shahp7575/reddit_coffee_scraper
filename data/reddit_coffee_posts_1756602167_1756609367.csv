My mom lives in FL and wants to visit to meet the baby. I had casually mentioned to her that maybe she could come around Thanksgiving when she asked when she could visit. Then, without discussing it again in detail, she took off the whole week of thanksgiving and now I’m super anxious about it lol. 

I’m looking for advice on when I should ask her to come. I’ve ruled out Thanksgiving week because of how busy travel is and wanting to minimize germ exposure that early on. So I was thinking of asking her to either come a week or two before Thanksgiving, or in January, when everything has slowed down a bit after the holidays (plus NYC is pleasantly empty/quiet then). 

My main concern about November is that I will still be pretty freshly postpartum and figuring everything out. My mom is a pretty annoying house guest (isn’t helpful, requires my husband or I to do simple things for her like make coffee with a Nespresso…). She also gets on my nerves easily, so I worry about dealing with that while two months post partum and getting little sleep. 

My only concern about January is that it is apparently peak flu/cold season (Dec-Feb). 

Anyway, what would you do? Thank you in advance 🙏🏼",1,1756609144.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

He was supposed to apologise … but royal relations never really recovered

[Valentine Low](https://www.thetimes.com/profile/valentine-low) Saturday August 30 2025, 6.00pm BST, The Sunday Times

Boris Johnson won the Tory leadership in July 2019 on a promise that he would deliver Brexit by October 31, “no ifs, no buts”. If he could not get a deal with Brussels, he said, he would prepare for a no-deal Brexit. But with the anti-Brexit forces in parliament doing their best to frustrate his every move, and time running out, he needed to find a way to break through. He needed a bold plan. And that plan was prorogation.

Prorogation is the formal term given to the period between the end of one session of parliament and the state opening that begins the next. There is nothing controversial about it — it happens every year. But what Johnson and the tiny, secretive team around him were planning was highly controversial, because they were going to prorogue parliament for five weeks.

Prorogation normally lasts less than a week, or two at the most. And the reason they wanted to do this was to stop the Remainers passing legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit. Johnson wanted no-deal to remain a real possibility, so he could use it as a bargaining tool against the European Union.

Proroguing parliament between September 9 and October 14 would keep the threat of no-deal alive, regardless of whether Johnson was actually prepared to go through with it. Everyone in on the plan was sworn to secrecy. The attorney-general had advised the PM that it was lawful.

A few days before the plan was put into action, No 10 told Buckingham Palace what \[it was\] proposing. Prorogation is always formally carried out by the sovereign on the advice of the privy council, and takes effect when a royal proclamation is read to both houses of parliament.

The Palace, according to [Sir Anthony Seldon’s](https://www.thetimes.com/article/if-a-great-leader-is-out-there-tories-wont-find-them-quickly-h6wws8g3m) account of Johnson’s time at No 10, was very unhappy about it, not least because it came during Queen Elizabeth II’s summer break at Balmoral: “They hadn’t been properly prepared and warned when on holiday in August, and the Palace felt they would have been in a stronger position had they been contacted earlier and had a chance to think it through.”

“There’s no doubt it caused a lot of consternation,” said another close source.

Officials were aware that the Queen was being asked to do something extremely unusual, and [her private secretary, Edward Young](https://www.thetimes.com/article/queen-remainer-power-politics-palace-vc6dlmkzt), took the precaution of taking a few highly informal soundings from lawyers. “There was quite a view,” said one royal insider, “that this may not have been palatable but it was within the government’s right to do it.”

The situation was not helped by the fact that the “golden triangle” — the crucial relationship between the sovereign’s private secretary, the cabinet secretary and the principal private secretary at No 10 — was not functioning properly. Sir Mark Sedwill, who was not trusted by Johnson or Dominic Cummings and did not know how much longer he would be in a job, was hard to get hold of, and No 10 had a new private secretary in the person of Martin Reynolds who was still finding his feet. “It was a very difficult time,” said a palace source.

On the morning of Wednesday, August 28, Jacob Rees-Mogg, in his capacity as lord president of the privy council, set off from London for Balmoral with two fellow privy counsellors, the chief whip, Mark Spencer, and Baroness Evans of Bowes Park, the leader of the House of Lords. “It was all hush-hush,” recalled Rees-Mogg. Spencer said: “I didn’t even tell my wife that I was going to Balmoral until the night before.” Their hopes of reaching Scotland unnoticed were vanishingly slim, however: the news had started to leak, and a handful of Scottish photographers were on their way to Aberdeen airport.

Even if there had been no leak, Rees-Mogg is one of the most recognisable figures in British politics. “I get spotted in Heathrow straight away,” he said. “I went through security and the man who just patted me down wanted a selfie.” Then, as they boarded the plane, they noticed that former Black Rod David Leakey was on the same flight. “So at that point, it’s clocked that we are doing something,” said Rees-Mogg. When they arrived at Aberdeen, all their phones went off, because there was an emergency cabinet meeting to get its approval for prorogation.

“We’re walking off the aeroplane, with a cabinet meeting in one ear, and people coming up to me for selfies in the other ear. I was literally doing selfies as I was on a cabinet meeting call. And then we have the most wonderful trip in a charabanc to Balmoral, with the Queen’s hairdresser, who is the most amusing man. He entertains us the whole way. He was the Queen’s hairdresser for over 20 years, he took over the weekend after Diana, Princess of Wales died. He said the first time he cut the Queen’s hair, he was so nervous that he didn’t dare breathe on her. So he’d hold his breath. And he has very long hair, and he said, ‘The Queen keeps on telling me I must have my hair cut’. So that kept us entertained until we got there.”

Meanwhile, the Queen had already given her approval to the plan, having spoken on the phone to Johnson. The privy counsellors were welcomed with coffee and sandwiches, then Rees-Mogg was ushered into the Queen’s study for a brief audience before the privy council meeting: just the two of them, plus one elderly corgi. The Queen, however, didn’t want the dog at the privy council meeting. “So then there was the Queen, aged 93, trying to get this corgi out, and the corgi is deaf and elderly and won’t go. Eventually she does heave the corgi out, and we get on to the privy council.”

Even though the Queen hated having her holidays in Balmoral interrupted, she was, said Rees-Mogg, “amazingly graceful”. He said: “We’d been warned that it might be frosty. But the Queen couldn’t have been more friendly. She was saying, ‘I’m sorry you’ve had to come such a long way’.” Five minutes later, it was all done. The privy counsellors got back into their vehicle for the journey back to the airport. Prorogation had been set in train, and the political fireworks were about to begin.

The Queen “took it all in her stride”, according to a royal source. There was, however, deep uneasiness within the Palace that she had been put in such an awkward situation. But could she have done anything about it? Probably not. Some senior Whitehall sources wonder why the Palace did not opt for some kind of delaying tactic when Rees-Mogg et al arrived at Balmoral, even if only to say, “I’m afraid the Queen is indisposed for a few hours, please have a cup of tea”, while they found out what the hell was going on. But even if they had, all the cabinet secretary could have said was that the attorney-general thought it was lawful.

The historian Peter Hennessy believes that the “No 1 rule” of what he calls the “good chaps” theory of government — that the constitution relies on a shared understanding of what constitutes good behaviour in public and political life — is “that you do nothing to embarrass the monarch”. The prorogation, he said, “was bound to embarrass the Queen because it was going to split the parties and the nation and everybody. The Palace was deeply upset by this.”

It all turned out to be irrelevant anyway. Amid the furious reaction to Johnson’s prorogation coup, pro-EU MPs introduced legislation to stop the prime minister pursuing a no-deal Brexit. Johnson’s hands were tied.

On September 24, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the advice to prorogue parliament was unlawful. Johnson was in New York when he heard the news. Furious, he railed at his closest aides: “You f\*\*\*ed me! You told me it would be fine. This is a disaster. I’m completely f\*\*\*ed. It’s over. Now, what am I going to do?”

There was one thing he could do: apologise to the Queen. Former prime minister Sir John Major called on Johnson to make an “unreserved apology”, saying: “No prime minister must ever treat the monarch or parliament in this way again.” The Queen’s reaction was said to be more “sanguine”. She reportedly regarded Johnson as a roguish and comic figure, and a month after the judgment remarked of him: “I think he was perhaps better suited to the stage.”

Five days after the Supreme Court ruling, The Sunday Times reported that the prime minister had personally apologised to the Queen for requiring her to approve the unlawful suspension of the House of Commons. The paper quoted a No 10 source as saying: “He got on to the Queen as quickly as possible to say how sorry he was.”

A Whitehall source told me: “He was very scared about going to see her immediately after prorogation to apologise. He really minded about the Queen. He does not like to apologise, ever. The guy does not say sorry. It would have been so humiliating for him to have to apologise to her.”

Another Downing Street source said Johnson “certainly would have felt uncomfortable” about embarrassing the Queen. “He had enormous respect and affection for the Queen. He won’t have liked it.” But did he actually apologise? Buckingham Palace insiders cannot say, because they were not in the room at the time.

Johnson never told them that he was about to apologise to the Queen, and certainly never apologised to anyone else at the Palace. Downing Street insiders say that the expectation and understanding was that he was going to apologise, but they do not know whether he actually followed through. “It is perfectly possible that once he got in the room he just bottled it and never did,” said one.

In his memoirs Johnson said nothing about an apology, which is perhaps hardly surprising, but this was certainly not due to any scruples he may have had about revealing the details of his conversations with the Queen. He was quite happy to recount what happened in their last audience, and to disclose that she was allegedly suffering from bone cancer. The Palace privately expressed “considerable concern” about such indiscretions, which for courtiers is strong language indeed. Questioned by this author about it via email, Johnson said two things. The first was: “For all I could tell from the Palace they thought the Supreme Court judgment was as peculiar as I did.”

That is not entirely true, but not entirely false, either. The Palace certainly was not expecting the judgment to go the way it did, but that is not to say it regarded the judgment as “peculiar”.

The second thing that Johnson said was: “I cannot comment on the view of the late Queen but the idea of some sort of apology is total fiction.” In other words, ever since September 2019 the world has believed that Boris Johnson said sorry to the Queen for embarrassing her over prorogation, and it turns out he did no such thing.

# Boris and Charles feel the strain

While Johnson did his best — not always successfully — to foster a good relationship with Queen Elizabeth, his dealings with the heir to the throne were all too often less than harmonious. At the end of the summer of 2019, after visiting the Queen at Balmoral, Johnson and Carrie Symonds, his then girlfriend, were invited to visit the Prince of Wales at Birkhall, his home on the estate. Johnson was said to have been in a “shambolic state” and “not focused on the meeting with the Prince of Wales in a way one might expect”. Charles did not make a fuss, but courtiers felt it smacked of a lack of respect.

Three years later they got a chance to find out what disrespect really looked like. In April 2022, Johnson launched his plan to tackle the problem of illegal migration by sending those who arrived in the UK illegally to Rwanda, from where they could apply for asylum. It was greeted immediately with widespread opposition.

On the afternoon of June 10, The Times was about to publish a story that the Prince of Wales had privately described the Rwanda plan as “appalling”. The story, which was due to go on the front page the next morning, said that Charles was particularly frustrated as he was due to represent the Queen at the Commonwealth summit in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, later that month. The Times had already approached Clarence House for comment, and it had in turn warned No 10 what was happening. Then, before The Times had put the story up on its website, a half-baked version of the story appeared on the Mail Online website. Simon Enright, Charles’s communications secretary, was furious that the Mail had been tipped off. He wanted to kill the story, not spread it all over the internet.

Peter Wilson, the prime minister’s principal private secretary, was mortified that there should be tensions between the Palace and No 10. On the other hand, the Downing Street director of communications, Guto Harri, was not one to be intimidated by the Palace, and was more relaxed because he could see that it might play well politically for No 10. The Prince of Wales moaning about a dynamic policy that promised to solve the migration crisis was not necessarily a bad look. In the Palace there was a lot of anxiety and a desire to patch things up and stop the story getting worse.

The Home Office did its best to stop a row developing between the government and the Prince of Wales. As for Johnson, he was plotting his revenge on Charles. As the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Kigali approached, Clarence House was keen to arrange a photograph of the prince shaking hands with the prime minister. However, on the plane to Rwanda, Boris had other things on his mind, telling journalists he hoped to help others “shed some of their condescending attitudes towards Rwanda”. It was, said Harri, “a dig at Charles, without mentioning Charles”.

He added: “Charles had slagged off a key and difficult policy decision. Boris is not a man to let that go. He does not get angry or upset, but he gets even. I remember Boris telling me once, ‘I fear no man’. But it was slightly playful as well: I think he was enjoying \[Charles’s\] discomfort.”

The prince’s officials knew exactly what was going on. Johnson, they believe, deliberately kept the story going with his briefing on the plane. In Kigali, the Prince of Wales and the prime minister had their photo opportunity, shaking hands, smiling, seemingly getting on pretty well.

In private, Johnson confronted the prince about whether he had criticised government policy, and Charles conceded that inadvertently he may have said something. Then they discussed their forthcoming speeches, and Charles said he wanted to talk about slavery. “The prime minister just couldn’t help himself. He basically told the future King, ‘I wouldn’t talk about slavery if I \[were\] you, or you’ll end up having to sell the Duchy of Cornwall to pay reparations’. Imagine the prime minister telling the future King that. I don’t think relations ever fully recovered.”

1n4jtmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/1n4jtmt/visiting_home/,"Visiting ""home""","There's a lot out there about how visiting your parents can be triggering of childhood trauma, and I've definitely experienced that. But my most recent (current) visit to my mom makes me wonder about the more mundane unpleasantness of visiting a parent, that I feel I should have more control over. 

A few specifics, my mom moved from the town I grew up in to a small college town. I don't have any connection to the town and I don't particularly like it. It's fine, and there's a small, walkable downtown. Decent coffee shops, a bookstore. The state is very Republican, but the town is more liberal. 

I don't drive, so can't access anything outside of the downtown without my mom driving, which contributes to restlessness and feeling like a child. 
I actually got my license last year, in part with this situation in mind, but I live in New York and rarely practice, so I'm not comfortable driving alone.

I guess my question is, what do people do when they visit their parents? There's something that feels inherently awkard about being 30, single, no kids, visiting my mom alone. I do have a sister, but she more or less refuses to visit. She has a more fraught relationship with our mom, so if I visit im on my own.

I try taking walks alone, reading, tackling some administrative things for my own life. But I feel so disconnected from myself and my real life when I visit that it's hard to focus on that sort of thing. My mom is getting older and I don't want to avoid visits with her because of my own discomfort. In the past she's contributed to it by being difficult in certain ways, but I notice my anxiety and discomfort arising just from feeling stuck, regardless of her actions.

We’ve been getting super close over the past couple of years, ranging from texting all the time (never about work), to going on (basically) dates 1:1 (movies on multiple weekend nights, drinks until 2am, coffees, shopping, etc). I didn’t think much about it at first when he was initiating all these things, but now I really am starting to like him, and I feel like I should shoot my shot. I deeply admire and respect him and we have so much fun together! I would say at this point we’re super close friends too. The closeness started this year I’d say, and really escalated over the past 2-3 months.

Only concern is I just don’t know how he’s going to react bc I’m not actually sure about his feelings and I don’t know how to move past the friendship stage. He’s given me mixed signals with asking me to hang out 1:1 all the time and texting me everyday to then not saying anything for a week. It feels like it really slowed down esp in the past few weeks, after an intense month of texting and DMing all the time. We also don’t report into each other or work on any same projects but are on the same broader team. So while not worried personally about our working relationship, maybe he is? He’s technically more senior than me, if that’s relevant.

So on my third day I was expected to take orders starting in the morning to after lunch. I was expected to learn all the non soft drink beverages and make them while taking the orders. By yesterday I was taking a nonstop orders (times as low as 10 to 20 seconds per order). While trying to pour coffees, orange juice, make ice coffee, McCafes, shakes, frozen drinks, oatmeal and fill all the empty products on all of these machines. Yesterday I was pouring with sweat. 15 minutes before the end of my shift I had to run to the bathroom. I almost fainted and did throw up. 

Occasionally they would have someone help. They also failed to tell me duplicate stickers get printed for the drinks. 

Is this normal to do to a new employee? All while getting told that I was a terrible drink person by the window server. Yesterday I essentially didn't have a trainer assigned to me. I did get help if I asked.

I thought I was going to die yesterday. I don't even want to return. I feel like this job is literally going to kill me. I feel like the window server is going to stab me, even if the stress doesn't. 

My managers seem to love me, but they don't seem to realize how overwhelmed I am in this position. I don't even know what to tell them. To me thy should know they pushed me too hard for a new employee.

Like, am I missing something or is this real life?! 

I literally stumbled into this black hole of ""get paid to test new features"" apps, and my mind is blown. Why is nobody talking about these?! Guys—it's LEGIT now, not one of those shady survey things 🙄. Here’s my breakdown of the absolute TOP **7** apps you can hop onto right now:

---

- **GoodNovel Test App**: I kid you NOT, testing this app's new reading features pays more than my weekly coffee habit. Paid to preview stories = easy cash. Here’s the insane part: I just signed up, used the features, and had $$$ in PayPal two days later. Sign up here 👉 **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

- UserCrowd: This one's wild—they toss simple “try this new button” tasks for fresh features. Payouts are frequent and the UI actually makes sense.

- BetaTesting: Is this real? Signed up for app feature tests and actually got paid. Full transparency, not every app test is a goldmine, but it’s one of the more reliable options by far.

---

WAIT. It gets better! Literally sitting on my couch, bingeing thrillers, and these apps are pinging me to TEST a new feature. I tested FOUR just last night! No coding skills, no weird “extra steps.” 

---

- **GoodNovel Test App** (again, because honestly, it keeps paying): Every time they roll out a new chapter navigation or story review feature, real money flows my way. Could it get easier?? Here’s the golden link: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

- PlaytestCloud: More game-focussed. You play the game, try out new features, review glitches, and—yep—get actual, tangible money and not gift cards.

- Ferpection: I’m honestly confused how this isn’t more famous?? Apps want your unfiltered feedback for feature launch, and BOOM, reward time.

---

Are you ready for #7?? THIS blew my mind:

- **GoodNovel Test App** YES, a THIRD TIME, because the ongoing updates are endless and so are the payouts. Plus, it actually pays users globally—which, let’s be real, not every app does. Try it ASAP: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

---

And let me just emphasize, every single time GoodNovel drops a new update I get an invite and yes, every time I slam that YES button for free cash. It almost feels illegal but it’s not—just new in 2025. Here it is AGAIN: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

If you’re confused or suspicious: SAME. I was too. But now my Venmo is poppin’ so I’m not asking any more questions.

https://www.coffeereview.com/review/organic-fair-trade-ethiopia-yirgacheffe/

I mostly had it as a machine-drip coffee and remember it having a strong jasmine floral aroma, but being sweet and lightly lemony.  Since they discontinued it I’ve purchased a bunch of washed Yirgacheffes and other light roast beans that had floral in the tasting notes, but always found the fruitiness to be sharper and stronger than Green Mountain’s.  (They’re great in other ways but I’m really trying to recreate this cup from my memory.)

After this latest trip I think I've actually reached the that point.

I think this is one of the reasons that Airbnb has become so popular. People are tired of checking into ""luxury"" hotels where they only luxury might be the stale air you breathe and cheesy stucco sculptures in their lobbies and overpriced bars.

I’ll explain, during a big advanced unlimited license sale I bought a bunch of them for convenience’s sake (I had enough baitcoins). But something went screwy, and instead of advanced licenses the game gave me basic. PSI basic licenses are useless.

I was pissed, contacted support, they said they couldn’t replicate the issue so couldn’t help me; I was more pissed.

Then a thought struck me; I’ve been playing for free since 2017. They haven’t gotten a dime out of me in that time, but I’ve been enjoying this game. This struck me as odd, didn’t fit. 

I couldn’t justify $30-60 for some rods or boat or w/e, but there was a $10 pack w/ club tokens and sunglasses. 

Mad as I was at the screwup that wasn’t acknowledged by them, I still felt I owed the dev team. I have genuinely enjoyed Fishing Planet for years up to that snafu moment. 

So I bought the $10 pack. I didn’t need it, I was lvl 84, completely free. But it seemed right. And the shades are cool.

If you’ve been playing for a while for free, and been enjoying it, send’em a cup of coffee. Doesn’t cost you much, you feel you paid for what you received, and it encourages the team to keep working on this game we all enjoy. Ok, sermon over ✌️

Since switching to remote, something shifted. I started cooking again. I picked up photography, which I hadn’t touched since college. I read actual books. Even my social life improved, weirdly enough. I have energy for hobbies, friends, conversations that go beyond small talk. It feels like I got my brain back.

I’m not saying remote work is a magical fix. There are still rough days, Zoom fatigue is real, and sometimes I miss random coffee break convos. But overall, I feel more focused, more creative, more... me.

Almost exclusively making filter coffee (aeropress, v60, switch). JX-Pro was my first ""nice grinder"" after getting serious about coffee. This year I've slowly doubled down on my seriousness with filter coffee - having a lot of fun!

Was curious what the ZP6 will bring me in terms of cup quality and clarity. Primarily, what to the grounds actually look like? Im not sure what the best way to quantify that is so I took some close ups of the grinds on a 1""x1"" grid. Both grinders set to \~650 micrometers per honestcoffeeguide.com.

Results in photos. See captions.

I immediately noticed the difference visually. The ZP6 grounds seemed much more consistent, less fines, less boulders. It looked a different color almost, not sure how but there looked to be less chaff appearance in the final grind. I have taken decent care of my 4 year old grinder. Not sure how much age has affected it.

I was less interested in taste at the moment, and these grinds were mixed in together to a cup (50/50). I will say I thought I may have detected a clearer cup though.

What do yall think? Whats the best way to quantify grind results at home? Do you need to adjust these out of the box (I think not)?",5,1756607072.0,pourover,2,0.78,False

The issue is obviously she’s actually actively trying to die. She was in a northeast facing window in the bathroom. Blurred window, not sure if that makes a difference. She was up against the glass however it’s not been cold. 

Since noticing her in all her droopiness I’ve moved her into a southwest facing room, not up against the glass (but about 1.5m from the coffee table). 

I don’t really know what my watering schedule is, usually I’d go by her being depressed looking I’d water but now I stick my finger in the pot to check for moisture. 

I water her when she’s dry though also object permanence and the ability to remember go brr so I don’t actually know if I’m over or under watering. She’s got some plastic bottle caps between the nursery pot and the ceramic pot for extra drainage bc I’m convinced she’s drowning idk.

The music video was of an animated woman walking around as things happened in the scenery (plants growing, walking through the rain, etc)- I think it was pastel fabric patterns or paper patterns, but it was fluidly animated.

I can add a video in of the song I played on an online keyboard if it will let me load it soon, but the main line I remember was ""1 and a 2 and a 3 and a 4 and a 1--- And a 3---"". The notes for those beats are (possibly in a different key?) ""F# G A  F# G A  F# G A  F# G A  E--- F# B D---""

  June 27, Olathe, Kansas  
  
  The man who was going to stand by and watch while Helen burned to death liked his coffee black.  
  
  Helen looked up from her menu and, across the little diner, she saw him sitting there, not twenty feet away. He was the man of her dreams—or more accurately, of her visions. Technically it was just one vision. Over and over. She was going up in flames while he watched. Smiling at her.  
  
  “See something you like?” asked Lexi, the diner’s only waitress on duty. She’d been working at Gertie’s Diner for only a couple of months now, but there was something about her that made Helen trust her enough to share things no other living person knew, including Helen’s vision of her own death. “Cook’s gone for the day, so all we have left is meat loaf, baked chicken, and pot roast. Pick your poison. ”  
  
  Across from Helen, her dinner companion, Miss Mabel, sat low in the red vinyl booth. Her age-hunched shoulders barely cleared the table. Her gnarled hands gripped the laminated menu, which wavered so much Helen wasn’t sure how she could read it without getting motion sickness.  
  
  “How’s the meat loaf?” asked Miss Mabel.  
  
  Lexi was a petite twenty-something with a killer body and a brain to match. What she was doing waiting tables in Olathe, Kansas, living in her car, was a total mystery to Helen—one Lexi refused to solve no matter how many times Helen asked. She’d offered to let Lexi stay with her until she found a place, but Lexi said she wouldn’t bring trouble to Helen’s doorstep when she clearly had enough of her own.  
  
  Lexi leaned down until her short, white-blond spikes threatened to poke Miss Mabel in the eye. “You’d be safer eating two-day-old roadkill, which is what I’m guessing Paulo used to make the meat loaf. He left early when I started asking questions about it. Smart man. ”  
  
  Miss Mabel blanched a little. “Definitely no meat loaf. I’ll take the pot roast. ”  
  
  Lexi winked and wrote it down on her pad of order slips. “How ’bout you, Helen? What can I get you today?”  
  
  Helen tried to focus on her menu as she held it up to shield her face so Vision Man couldn’t see her. Her hands trembled, making the words blur. She was already on the verge of panic. If he caught her watching him, she was sure she’d lose it completely.  
  
  Helen wanted to scream at Lexi to throw the pot of scalding coffee into his lap and run away. Instead, she fought her rising panic for a chance to learn something about him in the hope of escaping the vision. She sank lower in her seat and tried to pretend that everything was fine, which she did with flying colors. Helen had a lot of practice at pretending everything was fine.  
  
  “I’m not sure,” said Helen to stall for more time, hoping her hands would stop shaking so hard she could read the menu. Against her better judgment, she eased the menu aside so she could take a quick peek. Maybe she’d imagined it was him.  
  
  Nope. It was Vision Man. In the flesh.  
  
  He listened to what one of the men sitting across from him was saying while he sipped his coffee. One thick arm was sprawled out across the back of the booth and she could see some sort of tattoo peeking out from under Vision Man’s T-shirt sleeve. Strands of hair, maybe? Vines? She couldn’t be sure at this distance and she didn’t think staring long enough to figure it out was a smart move. She did not want him to notice her staring. She didn’t want him to notice her, period.  
  
  He had thick brown hair that was just getting long enough to show off a bit of curl. And that was the only thing about him that looked soft. He had high, almost sharp cheekbones with deep hollows beneath. His mouth was pressed into a hard, flat line as he listened to his friend, his expression grim, almost angry. The muscles in his jaw bunched as if he was grinding his teeth, and Helen had the distinct impression that he was in pain. Lots of pain.  
  
  Good. It served him right for watching her die. Not that he’d committed that particular crime yet, but he would. She knew it like she knew the sun would set in a few minutes. There was nothing fake or distorted about her vision. She’d tried for years to find some flaw, some speck of doubt that what she saw was real. Tried and failed. And now she knew that her time was nearly up. The man in her vision was this man, not an older version of him.  
  
  Helen was going to die soon. Maybe tonight.  
  
  Grief and fear swelled up in her chest and she fought them down. Focused on her breathing and relaxing each little muscle starting at her fingertips. She’d learned the technique from her therapist, who was convinced she was suffering from some sort of delusion. All she had to do was face it and it would go away. Well, she was facing it now and it wasn’t going anywhere. Fifty thousand dollars and many years later, she was still just as deluded, but at least she could keep the fear at bay. Breathing and relaxing was the only way she knew to control the panic. The only way to keep herself from screaming in terror.  
  
  Burning alive. What a fucking gruesome fate.  
  
  She’d tried to prepare herself for this, but she’d obviously failed. It was too soon. She wasn’t ready to die yet. There was still so much work left to be done. So many people who needed her help.  
  
  “You okay?” asked Lexi, her pale forehead puckering with a frown. She glanced over her shoulder to where Helen kept trying not to look. Vision Man and two others sat drinking coffee and eating pie as though they had all the time in the world. Man, wouldn’t that be nice.  
  
  “Those guys bothering you?” asked Lexi, sounding more worried from Helen’s lack of response.  
  
  “Uh, no. ” Just breathe. That’s all she had to do. Breathe in. Breathe out. “I’ll have the pot roast, too. ”  
  
  Lexi turned back around. “Now I know something’s wrong. You never eat red meat. ”  
  
  “Yeah, well, you can’t live forever,” said Helen.  
  
  Lexi’s petite body stilled and Helen could almost hear the wheels in her head turn. “Holy shit! That’s him, isn’t it?” asked Lexi in a near whisper.  
  
  Helen wished for the millionth time that she’d just kept her mouth shut, or that Lexi wasn’t quite so intuitive. Lexi should have been a bartender or an interrogator instead of a waitress, the way she was able to get a woman to spill her guts.  
  
  Miss Mabel’s scarlet lips turned down in a disapproving frown. “I thought I’d quit hearing talk like that when I retired from teaching high school. ”  
  
  “Sorry, Miss Mabel,” said Lexi, patting the older woman’s hand. “Pie’s on me tonight as payment for my potty mouth. ”  
  
  “Forget the pie, tell me about the man. ” Miss Mabel twisted her bent body around in her seat so she could see where Lexi had been looking. Not that the men were hard to spot, seeing as how they were the only other customers in the diner tonight—well after the dinner rush.  
  
  Helen felt a frantic bubble of fear rise up inside her. “Don’t look!”  
  
  “You never told me you had a boyfriend,” said Miss Mabel as if it was the crime of the century—a huge betrayal of their friendship that she’d kept a secret.  
  
  “He’s not my boyfriend. Stop looking!” She was begging, on the verge of panic. What if he noticed them looking? What if he walked over here right now and looked at her with that half smile on his face—the one he wore when he watched her die? This could be her last few minutes on earth and the only solace she could find was that her will was updated and all the money she’d inherited from her mother would go to help pediatric burn victims.  
  
  Lexi—bless her—shifted her slim hips so that they were between the men and Miss Mabel’s wide, obvious gaze. Helen knew that if the men did bother to look over here, one glance at Lexi’s ass would be enough distraction for any red-blooded man to forget what he’d just been thinking.  
  
  Miss Mabel struggled to get her frail spine to cooperate, but couldn’t manag  
e to outmaneuver Lexi—not with her waitress reflexes. The old woman gave a frustrated sigh. “You either tell me what’s going on or I get my walker and go over there and find out for myself. ”  
  
  Lexi gave Helen an apologetic grimace. “I should have kept my mouth shut. If you want, I’ll kick them out. ”  
  
  “That wouldn’t really help the whole trying-not-to-get-noticed thing I’m working on here,” said Helen.  
  
  “Why don’t you want those men to notice you? Are they stalkers? Should I call the police?” asked Miss Mabel. “I knew I should have bought one of those cell phones. ”  
  
  “No,” said Helen, trying to think fast enough to outwit a woman who had taught public school for thirty years. “He’s just a guy I have a crush on. I don’t want him to know. ”  
  
  “Why not? You’re a lovely girl and you should just go right over there and ask him out. That is how it’s done these days, and if I’m not too old to know that, then neither are you. ”  
  
  “I can’t do that. ” Helen slid down deeper in the booth seat and lifted the menu up to shield her face again.  
  
  “Well, then, I will. You need a man, Helen. I’m not going to let you end up old and childless like me. ” And with that declaration, Miss Mabel reached for her walker at the end of the booth, positioning it so she could stand.  
  
  Helen had to get Miss Mabel to stop before Vision Man saw her. Maybe if Helen got out of here unnoticed, there would still be time before she died. Even if it was only a few more days, or even hours, Helen wanted every one of them.  
  
  “You can’t. He’s married. ” The lie slipped out so smoothly it surprised Helen. It was the first time in her life she’d ever lied to a teacher, and already her stomach was turning sour.  
  
  Miss Mabel’s head whipped around faster than Helen would have thought possible, considering her frail neck and the weight of the giant bun she wore held up by a single yellow number-two pencil. “You’re lusting after a married man?” She whispered it as if just saying the words was a sin. “Oh, honey, don’t you know that can only end badly?”  
  
  Thank you, God. Miss Mabel swallowed the lie. “I know,” said Helen, hanging her head, still strategically placed behind the menu. “That’s why I’m staying away from him. I can’t help the way I feel about him, but I can keep my distance. ”  
  
  “See that you do,” said Miss Mabel, slipping into her lecturing voice. “Maybe we should just go now and have dinner elsewhere. ”  
  
  Hallelujah! “Good idea. We can go anywhere you like,” Helen told Miss Mabel. They always went out to eat on Tuesday night, and Helen couldn’t stand to disappoint her, not even if her world was spiraling toward its end. She’d spent the past ten years trying to do something meaningful with her life. She wasn’t smart enough to find a cure for cancer and she wasn’t strong enough to join the military or brave enough to join the police or firefighters, but she made a difference to a few dozen shut-ins, bringing them food and company or just getting them out of the house for a few hours. It wasn’t much to her, but it was to them. She saw it in their eyes every time she showed up at their front doors and every time she left. For some of those people, she was all they had and that was enough for her. It had to be. I think it’s too late to escape,” said Lexi. “He’s looking this way. ”  
  
  Helen lowered the menu enough to peek over it and sure enough, Lexi was right. Vision Man was looking right at her.  
  
  Drake saw the pretty young woman trying to hide from him. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t have looked twice at a human—pretty or not—but something about her tugged at his attention. Every time he looked at her, some of the grinding pressure inside him eased. The fact that she was trying not to get noticed only added to his curiosity.  
  
  “Have either of you ever seen the woman with the braids before?” he asked his buddies, Thomas and Zach.  
  
  Thomas swiveled his head around, leaning so he could see past Zach. He shrugged one massive shoulder. “Not that I can remember. ”  
  
  “Sorry, man,” said Zach, an appreciative grin on his dark face.  
  
  “You’re looking at the waitress,” scolded Drake.  
  
  “Yes, I am. ”  
  
  Unapologetic as ever, Zach rubbed a hand over his jaw and watched the waitress with the name tag that read LEXI wiggle her behind.  
  
  Drake thought about calling Zach on how easily he was distracted, but he knew it wouldn’t do any good. Besides, nothing important ever got by Zach. He could look at all the women he wanted and if things went to hell, he’d still have his sword in his hand faster than any of the three men at the table. Which was good, considering their mission.  
  
  He, Zach, and Thomas were hot on the trail of the Synestryn demons that had taken Kevin’s sword after they’d slaughtered him, and the last thing he needed right now was a distraction. This suburban Kansas town was crawling with demons. Literally. Or at least it would be once the sun set.  
  
  Drake checked his watch. Eight thirty-two. Nine minutes to sunset. Then Logan would show up and they all could get back to work. That left him eight minutes to figure out who this woman was and why she was hiding from him.  
  
  Drake got up and went to do just that.  
  
  The waitress stepped in his path as if she could actually stop him. How cute. He doubted there was a whole five feet of her unless he included those ridiculous blond spikes sticking out from her head.  
  
  “Can I get you some more coffee?” she asked with a cheerful, fake smile.  
  
  “No. My friends could use a refill, though. ” Zach had been eyeing the waitress all night, and as far as Drake was concerned, he could have her. She was just a little scrap of a woman—too fragile for any of the really fun stuff.  
  
  The shy brunette on the other hand . . . she had potential. He’d seen her come into the diner with the old lady, being so careful to help her walk without damaging the older woman’s pride. She was all soft curves and glowing warmth. Her light brown hair fell forward over her shoulders in twin braids, drawing his eye right to her breasts. As if he needed any help finding those. She filled out her tank top and then some, which he dutifully noticed. She was a couple of inches taller than average, and all that extra height was in her legs—long, curvy, bare under the cuffs of her khaki shorts. All of her was curvy and soft and feminine and Drake hated that he’d noticed.  
  
  He had more important things to think about—like killing off a slew of demons—and it was hard enough to keep his focus on his work when the pain was getting worse every day. He sure as hell didn’t need some soft, curvy distraction.  
  
  The waitress hadn’t taken the hint and she was still barring his path. Not a good idea considering he never let anything get in the way of something he wanted—certainly not something that weighed about as much as a week’s worth of laundry.  
  
  “How ’bout some more pie?” she asked.  
  
  “No, thanks. ” He picked her up under her arms, like a child, and set her aside.  
  
  “Hey!” he heard her sputter behind him, and almost expected her to jump on his back.  
  
  “I got her,” said Zach, his voice deep and satisfied with the task of keeping Lexi at bay.  
  
  Drake glanced over his shoulder and saw the waitress staring at Zach as if he were about to eat her whole. Maybe he was. Zach was into human women. As often as possible.  
  
  Drake felt a half smile tug at his mouth. “I just bet you do. ”  
  
  The brunette had given up hiding behind the menu and had started to gather her purse and sunglasses to leave. Not bloody likely. At least not until he was ready to let her leave.  
  
  Drake covered the distance between them and placed one hand on the back of the booth and the other on the table, caging her in. She’d scooted to the edge of the seat, but with Drake standing in her path, she had nowhere to go. He leaned down, letting her know with his body language that she was trapped.  
  
  He liked her face, the smooth curve of her cheek, the fullness of her mouth. She’d stayed out in the sun too long today and her nose and the top of her cheeks were pink. She wasn’t drop-dead gorgeous, but she was lovely. From here, it was easy to see fear brighten her hazel eyes, bringing out chips of gold and green.  
  
  She was afraid of him. He had no idea why, and he sure as hell didn’t like it.  
  
  “Please let me go,” she said. Her voice was quiet. Soft, like the rest of her, and it stroked over his senses like a caress.  
  
  A weightless warmth shimmered through him, washing away decades of tension and torment. For the first time in more than a century, Drake was no longer in agonizing pain. He let out a slow breath of relief. The ever-expanding pressure of the power he housed no longer beat at his insides, seeking an exit, trying to pound its way through flesh and bone. Every rioting bit of energy inside him quieted at the sound of her voice as if listening.  
  
  Without the pain that had been his constant companion for more years than most people lived, a wave of dizzying relief threatened to buckle his knees. He gripped the seat and table to keep himself upright, but he couldn’t keep his eyes from closing, just for a moment. The joy of simply not hurting was so intense it was nearly its own kind of pain. He wasn’t sure how long it took him to regain his senses, but when he did, she was staring at him, wide eyed and trembling.  
  
  “Who are you?” he demanded.  
  
  She blinked twice as if shocked by the question. “Please. Just let me go. I don’t want to die. ”  
  
  Die? What the hell? “I’m not going to hurt you,” he told her, his tone a little more gruff than he’d intended. He’d spent his too-long life defending humans from the Synestryn at great personal cost. There was no way she could have known that, but it still pissed him off that she would jump to the conclusion that he was here to hurt her.  
  
  What he really wanted was to touch her and see if she felt as soft as she looked. All those smooth, womanly curves were driving him a little crazy. And crazy was the only explanation for what he was feeling—this uncontrollable need to touch a woman he didn’t even know. A human woman. Maybe she was blooded—a descendant of the Solarc—and that’s why his reaction to her was so strong. He’d never experienced anything like it before even with a blooded human, and he wasn’t entirely sure he liked it. The pain-free part was nice, really nice, but nothing that good came without a price.  
  
  “I need to get Miss Mabel home. It’s getting late. ” Her mouth quivered a bit and damn if he didn’t want to bend down and kiss her to make it stop.  
  
  This was insane. Drake pulled in a deep, steadying breath, but only managed to fill his lungs with her scent. Lilacs. She smelled like lilacs.  
  
  Drake didn’t have a freaking chance of resisting her. He was a goner, completely over-the-edge insane. He leaned down until his nose was tucked into the curve of her neck, and breathed her in. There was nothing he could have done to stop himself, and the fact that she didn’t flinch away only made him that much crazier.  
  
  The silky strands of her braid teased his nose and the supple band of the luceria around his neck hummed happily, sending a shiver shooting down his back. He felt something shift inside him. Deep and hard, almost painful. This woman had changed him somehow, with her mere presence, and he would never be the same again.  
  
\>   Whoever she was, he was keeping her.  
  
  Helen didn’t dare move. Not with Vision Man standing so close, nearly touching her. She felt his warm breath spread out over her neck, swirl up around her ear.  
  
  He was purring—a low, deep sound of satisfaction—and that purr resonated inside her.  
  
  All she could see was the side of his thick neck where it joined his shoulder, the curl of his dark hair, and a section of the necklace he wore—some sort of iridescent choker about a quarter inch wide. Every color imaginable swirled inside the supple band as the lights of the diner played off its surface. She felt the urge to touch it to see if it was as slippery as it looked, if it was warm from his skin.  
  
  Instead, she hugged her purse more tightly against her chest, holding still, praying he’d move away from her before she lost her head and stroked her finger over the band.  
  
  She was breathing too fast, making herself dizzy. She closed her eyes to block out the sight of him so she could calm herself, but instead the vision flashed in her head, driving everything else away.  
  
  He was standing a few feet away. It was dark all around them and the only reason she could even see his face was that the fire that consumed her body reflected off the sharp angles of his cheeks, the shadowed ledge of his jaw, the strong tendons in his neck, the wide span of his shoulders. Mirrored flames danced in his golden brown eyes and a proud half smile tilted his mouth. She could smell her flesh burning, could feel the heat consume her. The pain of her blistered skin as it blackened was too much to bear. She screamed, begging death to come claim her.  
  
  Reality snapped back into place, washing the vision away. Helen sucked in a desperate breath. She wasn’t dead. At least not yet. The bright lights of the diner seared her retinas, and the smell of burning flesh was replaced by that of onions and french fries. A draft from the air vent overhead cooled her skin, making her shiver.  
  
  She forced her body to relax, to remember where she was. Just breathe.  
  
  Her lungs expanded, pulling in the scent of the man who had her trapped. Soap. Coffee. Clean male skin. He smelled nice. Safe. And if that wasn’t the most ridiculous thing she’d ever thought, then she didn’t know what was. If there was one person on the planet who wasn’t safe for her to be near, it was him, no matter how he smelled.  
  
  He was still only a scant inch away, giving off that low purr that resonated in her chest. Helen wasn’t sure if she wanted to push him away or stroke her finger over the intriguing curve of that choker he wore. Something about it tugged at her memories, though she was sure she’d never seen anything like it before.  
  
  He hadn’t been wearing it in her vision. The realization dawned on her. His throat had been bare. His shirt had been different—not the black cotton he wore now, but lighter. Tan. With some kind of tree printed on it.  
  
  The details of her vision didn’t match what was happening right now, which meant she was safe, at least for the moment.  
  
  Some of the panic drained out of her, making her feel weak, boneless. She knew she should push him away or scream or do something. Even if he wasn’t here to watch her die tonight, he was still too damn close.  
  
  He leaned a fraction of an inch closer and wrapped his long fingers around one of her braids. On his finger he wore a ring that matched his necklace and it flashed in an intriguing pattern of swirling colors that made her want to stare. An insistent tug on her braid tipped her head back and she was sure she’d felt his lips brush along her neck, her cheek.

1n4iysu,https://i.redd.it/us3iz8rwj9mf1.png,IBHCC Tabletop Proof-of-Concept Model - Revealing the Hidden 70%,"*This is an excerpt from Chapter 29, taken from the full comprehensive draft of ""From Waste to Abundance”*

This guide details the construction and operation of a small-scale, functional model of the Integrated Biomass-Hydro Combined Cascade (IBHCC) system. Its purpose is to provide a safe, visual, and intuitive demonstration that reveals a shocking truth: every conventional power plant on Earth is throwing away more energy than it captures. The entire apparatus can be safely operated on a standard picnic table or workbench, progressing from simple to advanced configurations that prove a single integrated system can replace all essential community infrastructure.

### The Revolutionary Observation

Before diving into construction, understand what this demonstration proves. Conventional power plants extract about 30% of a fuel's energy and discard the remaining 70% as ""waste heat"" and uncaptured matter. This tabletop model makes that waste visible and then demonstrates how the IBHCC captures and multiplies it into more power than the original extraction. A symbolic pinwheel will represent what everyone else settles for; the blazing LED at the end represents the abundance they throw away.

1. Components & Materials
The model is designed to be built from simple, accessible materials that effectively simulate their full-scale counterparts. (Refer to the Diagram for a visual representation of the complete assembly.)

 * Primary Heat Source: A miniature, ashless camping pellet stove is ideal to serve as the crucible. Alternatively, a laboratory hot plate can be used.

 * Boiler (Steam Source): A borosilicate glass flask with a side-arm for water return. This flask's sole purpose is to boil water and create the initial stream of steam.

 * Re-vaporizer Flask (Heat Exchanger): A separate, sealed metal hip flask. This flask contains no water. Its purpose is to act as a high-temperature heat exchanger. Superheated air is pumped through it to make its outer surface incredibly hot.

 * Superheated Air System:

   * Hot Air Pump: A standard hairdryer set to ""cool"" serves as the primary fan.

   * Primary Air Heating Coil: A length of copper tubing coiled to fit directly within the crucible. The hairdryer pumps ambient air through this coil, superheating it before it enters the Re-vaporizer Flask.

   * Insulated Air Ducting: The copper tubing continues from the coil. It is crucial that this tubing is wrapped in standard pipe insulation along its entire length, except for the specific points of heat transfer.

 * Symbolic Re-heating Burners: Small alcohol burners. These represent the ability to use internally produced biofuels (from coffee pellets, etc.) to add more energy into the system.

 * Ascension Silo & Condenser: A 2-3 foot long, clear tube. The top is fitted with an elbow bend containing several metal sink screens to act as the condenser.

 * Cold Air System:

   * Cold Air Pump: A second hairdryer, also set to ""cool.""

   * Ice Pit Simulator: An insulated cooler filled with ice. The hairdryer pumps air through this cooler to create a steady stream of cold air.

 * Heron Fountain Assembly: Comprised of a large top Reservoir Tank (bottle), a smaller, durable metal or glass Side Tank (to withstand direct heat), a threaded plumbing T joint, silicone tubing, two-way control valves. Placement of the feeder tube may need to be adjusted, as the hot air’s expansion may necessitate placement closer to the entrance / exit valve rather than the rear air pocket.

 * Turbine & Generator: A 3D-printed Pelton wheel connected to a small DC motor and an LED.

 * Symbolic Turbine: A lightweight paper or foil pinwheel.

2. Assembly & Priming
Assembly follows a logical sequence to demonstrate the progression from waste to wealth.

 * Heat Source & Boiler: Position the air heating coil inside the pellet stove. Place the borosilicate boiler flask on top.

 * Re-vaporizer Assembly: Place the metal Re-vaporizer Flask after the symbolic pinwheel's location. Connect the outlet of the air heating coil to the inlet of this flask. The outlet of the flask will become the start of your insulated hot air ducting.

 * Steam Path: Insert the Ascension Silo into the top of the boiler flask. The path for the steam is: Boiler -> Ascension Silo -> Symbolic Pinwheel -> Exterior of Re-vaporizer Flask -> Condenser.

 * Hot Air Path: Route the insulated hot air ducting from the Re-vaporizer Flask outlet so that it makes direct contact with the Ascension Silo and the Heron Fountain's Side Tank. Use the ""Half-Moon"" insulation cut (removing only the bottom half of the insulation at contact points) to maximize heat transfer while minimizing loss.

 * Cold Air Path: Position the cold air pump to blow through the ice chest. Duct the resulting cold air so that it blows both across the condenser screens and into the back of the elbow bend. This dual injection creates a powerful downdraft that forces the steam through the condenser.

 * Priming: Prime the water system as described previously, ensuring the Heron Fountain is fully primed with its valves closed before beginning the demonstration.

3. Step-by-Step Energy Demonstration

Step 1: The Topping Cycle (Conventional Waste)

 * Action: Heat the boiler. Observe the lightweight pinwheel spinning from the initial steam pressure.

 * Observation: The pinwheel turns steadily.

 * Key Message: ""This spinning pinwheel represents the entire output of a conventional power plant—roughly 30% of the fuel's energy. This is what they consider success. Everything that gets past this point is the 'waste' we are going to use.""

Step 2: Flash Re-Vaporization (The First Waste Capture)

 * Action: Activate the hot air pump. Superheated air now flows through the Re-vaporizer Flask, making its surface intensely hot.

 * Observation: The lower-energy steam coming off the pinwheel crackles and surges as it hits the hot flask, instantly re-energizing and rising up the silo with new vigor.

 * Key Message: ""We are now using waste heat, transported by air, to flash re-vaporize the steam. We've just boosted our working fluid for free, using energy that is normally thrown away.""

Step 3: The Bottoming Cycle & Thermal Supercharging

 * Action: Allow the re-energized steam to condense and run the Heron Fountain:
Let the top tank fill up with water and air before releasing the first valve
Once the first valve opens, the side tank will fill. Once it reaches 60-80% fill open the second valve to eject the water from the precision nozzle 
Once the flow is achieved, the passive feeder tube’s valve can be opened, the vacuum created from the side tank draining will continually suck water from the top tank (the valve can be adjusted to enhance or retard flow as needed).

The hot air ducting is actively heating the fountain's Side Tank.

 * Observation: The Pelton wheel spins and the LED blazes with intense brightness.

 * Key Message: ""This blazing light is powered entirely by their waste, which we have captured, re-energized, and multiplied. This is the true power of the IBHCC.""

4. Demonstrating the Six Services of a Single Fire
This model proves the IBHCC isn't just a power plant; it's a complete infrastructure engine providing six (or more) essential services from a single heat source.

 * Electricity: Demonstrated by the brightly lit LED on the main turbine.

 * Heated Air/Climate Control: The stream of hot air from the primary heating coil can be vented to demonstrate space heating.

 * Chilled Air/Climate Control: The stream of cold air from the ice pit simulator can be vented to demonstrate air conditioning.

 * Water Services (Fresh, Pumping, Treatment): If saltwater is used in the boiler, the condensed water is fresh, demonstrating energy-positive desalination. By adding a Y-junction to the final water output, you can show how this water can be diverted to a remote waypoint station, demonstrating the system's ability to act as a pumping station for brine or treated water (simulating partial sewage treatment).

 * Liquid Fuel: The symbolic alcohol burners represent the liquid biofuels that the full-scale system creates, another ""free"" energy source for direct application.

 * Pneumatic Transport: The exhaust from the hot air system can be used to show how pneumatic devices or even a small tube transport system could be powered, demonstrating the potential for a zero-energy material logistics network.

This comprehensive demonstration proves that one integrated system can replace the electric grid, the municipal water supply, gas lines, HVAC systems, fuel depots, and even local freight transport.

5. The Development Pathway: From Bonfire to Automation

This section details the most crucial aspect of the IBHCC's accessibility: its evolutionary design. The system can be initiated with ancient technology and then upgraded over time as a community gains resources and skills.

Stage 1: The Low-Tech Initiator

The entire system can be initiated without advanced technology.

 * The Primal Heat Source: Instead of a pellet stove, the process can begin with a simple, large, enclosed clay-kiln bonfire. The boiler is placed directly over this intense heat source.

 * Manual Priming: Once the boiler plate is sufficiently hot, the system is primed by manually pouring water onto the surface. It instantly flashes into steam, which rises into the Ascension Silo and begins the condensation and collection process.

Stage 2: The First Major Upgrade (Automating the System)

The manual priming phase is temporary. A more elegant and robust upgrade path is to build a small, simple steam engine.

 * Application: The initial steam from the boiler, which was turning the symbolic pinwheel, is now routed to power this small steam engine.

 * Automation: The mechanical output of the steam engine is then used, via a series of belts and pulleys, to directly power the two fans (hairdryers) for the hot and cold air systems.

 * The Result: The entire system's auxiliary components are now automated directly by the primary steam cycle. The ""waste"" steam from this engine's exhaust is then sent to the Re-vaporizer Flask to continue its journey, ensuring no energy is lost.
Stage 3: The Network Effect & Remote Activation
The true power of the IBHCC is realized when multiple systems are interconnected.

 * The Network Effect: A primary facility, such as a coastal desalination plant, can use its immense surplus of energy and pressure to pump both fresh water and brine inland to other facilities through a network of waypoint pumping stations. This allows for the replenishment of watersheds and the creation of inland marine ecosystems.

 * Flexible Fuel for a Flexible Network: The biorefinery process within a primary facility creates liquid biofuels. This fuel is not just for internal use; it is a portable, high-density energy source. It can be easily transported (even via the pneumatic tube network) to any waypoint station in the system. This means a remote pumping station can be kick-started or boosted using this fuel, providing incredible flexibility and resilience to the entire network.

 * Alternative Remote Power: For facilities with more means or in high-sun areas, these remote waypoint pumps could also be retrofitted with simple solar panels and electric heating pads instead of biofuel burners. This would allow them to use solar energy to provide the thermal supercharging for the Heron fountain, further decentralizing the energy inputs of the network.

## Waypoint Station Order of Operations

**Water Relay System (Simplified IBHCC Units)**

1. **Pressurized Water Input** - High-pressure water arrives from upstream station via pipe
2. **Collection Tank Fill** - Water fills elevated storage tank at waypoint
3. **Air Spring Formation** - Rising water compresses air pocket above
4. **Tank Full Signal** - Collection tank reaches capacity
5. **Prime Heron Fountain** - Open valve, water flows to side tank
6. **Side Tank Fill** - Fill to 60-75% capacity 
7. **Thermal Supercharging** - Liquid fuel (biodiesel/bio-oil) heats side tank air pocket
8. **Pressure Amplification** - Heated air exponentially increases water pressure
9. **Nozzle Release** - Open precision valve for high-velocity jet
10. **Pipe Transport** - Water shoots through transport pipe to next waypoint
11. **Repeat Cycle** - Next station repeats process, extending transport range

**Key Differences from Main System:**
- No power generation (no Pelton wheel/LED)
- Water flows straight through pipes instead of hitting turbines
- Each station extends transport range while maintaining pressure
- Liquid fuel keeps pressure amplification running at each waypoint
- Network can transport water hundreds of miles using only the original energy input

## Waypoint Network Applications

**Ecological Restoration:**
- **Desert Reclamation** - Transport seawater inland for controlled salt marsh creation and gradual soil remediation
- **Watershed Replenishment** - Pump water uphill to restore dried river systems and aquifers
- **Wildfire Prevention** - Create strategic water reserves in fire-prone areas for rapid deployment

**Agricultural Systems:**
- **Inland Aquaculture** - Transport seawater for marine fish farming hundreds of miles from coast
- **Precision Irrigation** - Deliver water exactly where needed without energy-consuming pump systems
- **Soil Remediation** - Transport treated water for healing damaged farmland

**Industrial Applications:**
- **Mining Site Restoration** - Pump clean water to remediate contaminated sites
- **Manufacturing** - Supply industrial processes with pressurized water without grid dependency
- **Cooling Systems** - Provide industrial cooling water using transport network pressure

**Emergency Response:**
- **Disaster Relief** - Rapidly establish water supply to disaster-affected areas
- **Remote Communities** - Connect isolated areas to reliable water networks
- **Strategic Reserves** - Create distributed water storage for regional resilience

## Network Interconnection & System Regeneration

**Full IBHCC Integration Points:**
- **System Re-energization** - Waypoint water can be directed into full IBHCC facilities downstream, where it gets completely re-energized through the full dual-system process
- **Water Addition** - Each full IBHCC system adds new water to the network (from seawater, groundwater, atmospheric water generation, etc.)
- **Pressure Restoration** - Full systems restore and amplify pressure for continued long-distance transport
- **Multi-Source Integration** - Network can draw from multiple water sources as it expands

**Network Multiplication Effect:**
Instead of water pressure gradually declining over distance, the network actually **gains capacity** as it grows. Each full IBHCC facility acts as both a destination and a regeneration point, taking in water from the transport network while simultaneously adding new water and pressure from local sources.

**Continental-Scale Implications:**
A coastal desalination IBHCC could pump water inland through waypoint stations to reach inland IBHCC facilities powered by local biomass. Those inland systems add river water or groundwater to the network while re-pressurizing the flow for further transport. The network becomes **self-reinforcing** - each addition makes the whole system more powerful and capable.

This creates a **cascade amplification effect** where the network's transport capacity grows exponentially rather than declining with distance, enabling truly continental-scale water management and ecological restoration using only the waste heat that conventional systems throw away.

The network transforms from simple point-to-point transport into a **living infrastructure system** that gets stronger and more capable as it expands.

## System Scaling & Universal Retrofit Potential

**Scalable Development Path:**
The IBHCC scales systematically from homestead (50-200 lbs coffee waste daily) to community (2-4 parallel systems) to industrial installations (6-12+ parallel arrays). Each scale maintains the same fundamental principles while increasing capacity through proven parallel multiplication.

**Universal Retrofit Applications:**
The waste heat recovery system can be retrofitted to virtually any existing thermal facility - coal plants, natural gas facilities, industrial processes, even oil refineries. Any facility with a steam stack becomes a candidate for IBHCC enhancement while maintaining existing baseline operations.

**Hydroelectric Plant Integration:**
Existing hydroelectric facilities present particularly elegant retrofit opportunities. The dam's water flow replaces the elevated storage tanks, requiring only addition of Heron Fountain pressure multiplication and precision nozzle systems. A portion of the dam's flow gets diverted through the pressure multiplication system, then delivered at higher velocity for enhanced turbine impact. Thermal supercharging can be powered by the plant's own electricity through electric heating coils rather than biodiesel, creating a fuel-free enhancement loop that increases total power output from the same water flow.

## Learning from Past Failures: The Salton Sea Lessons

The IBHCC's water management systems benefit from studying previous artificial water body failures. The Salton Sea in California demonstrates what happens when water systems lack proper engineering controls.

Created accidentally in 1905 when the Colorado River flooded California's Salton Basin, the Salton Sea initially became a recreational paradise attracting celebrities and luxury resorts. However, fundamental design flaws created environmental disaster:

- **No outlet strategy** caused dissolved salts to concentrate until salinity exceeded ocean levels
- **Uncontrolled agricultural runoff** created toxic algae blooms and massive fish die-offs  
- **Unlined basin** allowed contamination and geological instability

**IBHCC Solutions:** The system's condensation process creates pure distilled water, eliminating salt accumulation. Coffee-ash concrete liners provide permanent containment, while biological filtration through spirulina systems maintains water quality. Unlike single-purpose recreation, IBHCC systems provide energy, waste processing, and food production - creating permanent community value with multiple revenue streams.

## Addressing Institutional Skepticism

**The Cost Reality:** The IBHCC is fundamentally cheaper than conventional power plants being built today. It uses simpler core technologies (biomass gasifiers vs nuclear reactors) and produces its own building materials during operation, reducing infrastructure costs from 40-60% down to 5-10% of total project cost. No hidden subsidies, loan guarantees, or insurance backstops required.

**Scalable Implementation:** This isn't an ""all or nothing"" system. Start with homestead-scale units buildable without advanced expertise, then scale using materials the system produces. A small installation continuously creates ash for concrete, waste heat for curing insulation, and steam for processing structural materials - enabling organic growth impossible for other power systems.

**The Thermodynamics Question:** This isn't energy from nothing - it's strategic utilization of the complete biomass feedstock. The solid portion powers the base steam cycle, while liquid biofuels (from the same source material) provide targeted heating throughout the waste recovery system. Combined with pressure amplification from trapped air expansion and gravity-assisted water cycling, the total system extracts significantly more energy from the same fuel input than conventional single-cycle systems.

Think of it as two integrated systems: System 1 (conventional steam) provides baseline power, while System 2 (waste recovery) captures and redirects energy that would otherwise be lost to the atmosphere.

**Energy Balance Reality:** The auxiliary equipment (fans, pumps) does consume power, but this comes from the system's own electrical output - similar to how power plants use a portion of their generation for plant operations. The net gain comes from capturing waste heat that conventional plants vent directly to cooling towers or exhaust stacks.

**Why This Works:** Conventional thermal plants achieve ~30-40% efficiency because they operate as single-cycle systems. Combined-cycle plants (gas turbine + steam recovery) already prove that capturing ""waste"" from the first cycle can significantly boost total efficiency. The IBHCC extends this principle further by adding thermal storage, pressure amplification, and multiple heat recovery stages.

**Water Security Backstop:** Even if energy claims prove optimistic, the system provides energy-positive desalination using waste heat that's already being produced. This makes freshwater production essentially cost-free, providing enormous value through water security alone.

## The Steam Engine's Last Stand

While humanity invests hundreds of billions in fusion research - attempting to recreate stellar nuclear fires in magnetic bottles cooled to near absolute zero - the ultimate goal remains unchanged: heating water to create steam that spins turbines. We're building the most sophisticated machines in human history to accomplish what steam engines have done for centuries.

This raises a fundamental question: if our most advanced energy technology still depends on steam turbines, have we truly optimized steam systems to their limits? While brilliant minds contain plasma at 100 million degrees, we routinely discard 70% of thermal energy from every power plant as ""waste heat.""

The IBHCC suggests extraordinary performance may be achievable through systematic application of principles we've understood for millennia - thermal expansion, pressure multiplication, gravitational storage, and waste recovery - rather than requiring breakthrough physics decades away from practical application.

## The Undeniable Conclusion

When observers see that lonely pinwheel—representing everything conventional plants achieve—spinning above a system where the main LED blazes from the ""waste,"" where remote pumping stations can be powered by internally-produced fuel, the implications are staggering. This tabletop model proves that revolutionary infrastructure isn't about impossible technology; it's about intelligent engineering applied to the systematic waste we've accepted as normal. The only question remaining is not if this works, but how quickly we can scale it.

  STOOD UP  
  
  MAC  
  
  Looking around the crowded bar, I pull in a breath. There are lots of people here, and I can tell that most of them have come to have a drink before heading home after a long day at the office—men still wearing their suits, women in skirts and heels with their hair still perfectly styled. This isn’t the kind of place where I would normally hang out. There are no TVs playing in the corners of the room with the game on or men drinking beer while talking too loudly. It’s too sophisticated for that, with black-and-white photos in elegant frames hanging on the walls depicting Manhattan years ago, when the city was hardly more than a few blocks. Dark wood tables aren’t scratched or worn. The leather chairs aren’t peeling or falling apart at the seams; they all look new. Everything about this place screams class. Feeling a breeze come from the door, I turn to look at it and let out a disappointed breath when I see a beautiful woman walk in, followed by a good-looking man.  
  
  Picking up my cell phone off the top of the bar, I pull up my text messages and check to make sure that I haven’t gotten the time or date wrong, that I’m at the right place. Seeing that I am exactly where I’m supposed to be, my hand tightens around the phone in embarrassment. The guy I was supposed to be meeting for a drink is now thirty minutes late, and he hasn’t called or replied to the text I sent more than fifteen minutes ago. So I’ve officially been stood up. I drop my cell phone into my purse, then drain the glass holding my lemon-drop martini. I feel my face pinch as the sour taste hits my tongue, then I gasp when the vodka burns down my throat.  
  
  “Would you like another?” the bartender asks. My watering eyes meet her brown ones.  
  
  I should say no and just go home, but I know my sister Libby will be disappointed if I show up not even an hour after my date was supposed to begin. I really don’t want to see the pity in her eyes when I tell her Chris didn’t show. She was way more excited than I was that I had a date tonight, especially after my self-inflicted dry spell.  
  
  “Sure.” I give the bartender my answer and a smile. Without a word, she picks up the empty glass and carries it down to the other end of the bar. As I wait for her to come back, the woman reflected in the mirror across from me catches my attention. Even knowing she’s me, I still stare in disbelief. When I told Libby I was going out on a date, she insisted on doing my makeup and hair. I didn’t fight her like I normally would have because I wanted to make a good impression. I wanted my first date in two years to go well. But I look like a stranger. My hair, normally tied back in a ponytail, is down in a mass of wavy red curls. My eye makeup, normally only mascara, is smoldering and sexy, making me look mysterious. My lips, used to only ChapStick, look full and plump, thanks to the pink stain she used.  
  
  I wonder what Edward would think if he saw me right now.  
  
  With a deep sigh, I quickly push that thought aside, annoyed with myself for even wondering about him. Edward has been my friend since we met two years ago at a baseball game. We bonded over our love for the Mets and beer. He was easy to talk to, funny and kind. Since that day, I’ve had a crush on him—and have been trying to no avail to get him to notice me as more than just a friend.  
  
  I thought my plan was working until a few weeks ago, when he introduced me to his apparently longtime girlfriend. This caused me to realize the connection I thought we had was all in my head, and that I’d wasted two years of my life waiting for him to see me as more than just a beer-drinking buddy. Which brings me to sitting alone in a bar on a Friday night, all because I wanted to prove that I’m completely over my Edward crush. Well, that and seeing how happy my sister Fawn is with her new boyfriend. I wanted to see if I could find that for myself. So, really, this is all Fawn’s fault. If she wasn’t so happy, I probably wouldn’t have said yes to the first guy who asked me out. Shaking my head, I think about the time Fawn tried to get my other best guy friend, Tex, to ask me out. Not only is he married but happily—and to my good friend Elizabeth. That was embarrassing—but nothing compares with getting stood up tonight.  
  
  “Would you like me to start a tab?” The bartender brings me out of my thoughts by dropping a napkin and my drink in front of me on the bar.  
  
  “No, thanks.” I shake my head and pass her the fifty-dollar bill I got out earlier to cover my first drink.  
  
  “Are you sure?”  
  
  “Yes, thank you.” I smile, and she smiles back while smoothly taking the fifty from me. Picking up my fresh drink, I take a sip and then look toward the door when cool evening air rushes inside. Disappointment hits me when I don’t see my date—but that feeling is quickly washed away when my eyes lock on the man coming through the door, and my body tingles from head to toe.  
  
  The guy is handsome. No, not handsome. That word doesn’t do him justice. He’s gorgeous. But not model gorgeous. He’s too rough-looking for that. He looks like he’s recently spent time in the sun; his dark hair is slightly wavy and curls around his ears and neck, accentuating his strong jaw and full lips. I can’t tell the exact color of his eyes from where I’m sitting, but even from a distance they seem bright  
because of the dark lashes surrounding them. Pulling my eyes down from his face, I take in the expanse of his wide shoulders covered in a plaid shirt and leather jacket and a trim waist encased in a pair of jeans that mold to his thick legs. Drawing my gaze back up to his, I find him studying me with heat in his eyes. I shift in my chair, wondering what it would be like to run my fingers through his hair while he kissed me. Blinking at that forward thought, I shake my head and pull my eyes from his. I look down at my drink before picking it up and downing it in one shot. Hopping off my bar stool, I hold on to the edge of the bar because I’m wobbling in the heels that Libby insisted I borrow. Heels that almost killed me twice on the way to the bar because I can barely walk in them.  
  
  Getting the bartender’s attention, I point toward the hall that leads to the restrooms at the back of the bar to let her know I’m not taking off. She nods. Making my way through the crowd, I head down a long hallway and get into line behind two blondes who smile at me before resuming their conversation. “So did you finally try the lipstick I sent you?” one of them asks as I pull out my cell phone again to see if I have any missed calls or messages, which I don’t.  
  
  Stupid men.  
  
  “I forgot to tell you!” The other laughs. “I tested it out, and you were right! It didn’t come off even after the forty-minute blow job I gave Charles.”  
  
  Forty-minute blow job? I rub my own jaw just thinking about it.  
  
  “I told you it’s awesome stuff,” the friend replies as the door to the restroom opens and a woman comes out.  
  
  “You were right!” the other agrees. Then they both disappear behind the closed door.  
  
  Knowing Libby loves makeup, I smile while sending her a text.  
  
  I just overheard two women talking about lipstick that doesn’t come off when you’re giving head. I think you should check it out.  
  
  Not even two seconds later, my phone buzzes.  
  
  Ummm . . . thank you . . . I think?  
  
  It was actually a forty-minute blow job, I clarify.  
  
  A forty-minute blow job is way more impressive than lipstick that doesn’t come off, she replies.  
  
  I giggle, dropping my cell phone back into my bag just as the door opens and the women come out, laughing.  
  
  After finishing up in the bathroom, I start back to the front of the bar.  
  
  I stop suddenly—when I feel a hand hit my ass hard enough to sting.  
  
  “What the hell?” I start to spin around, but my heels wobble once more. Causing me to stumble right into a warm chest that smells like leather and mint.  
  
  “Are you all right?” Large hands capture my waist, and I blink up at my savior. Who also happens to be the guy I noticed earlier. One of his arms wraps around me, and he pulls me flush against his solid chest, making every inch of me come to life. “You okay?”  
  
  “What?” I ask, in shock.  
  
  He drags me up his body, then drops his face closer to mine.  
  
  “You okay?” I see his mouth move, but it takes a few seconds to register that he asked if I was okay. All I can seem to focus on is the way it feels to be pressed against him.  
  
  “I . . .” I shake my head to clear away the lust that is suddenly overwhelming me. “Yes . . . sorry. Thank you.”  
  
  “Good.” Smiling, he lets me go.  
  
  I wonder briefly if it’s too late to say I’m not okay just so he’ll hold on to me for a moment longer.  
  
  Sheesh, this guy is deadly.  
  
  “Thank you.” I bow at the waist while backing away.  
  
  He chuckles.  
  
  Turning on my heels, I head back for the bar as quickly as I can, thanking my lucky stars that I make it there without incident. I hop up on my stool—luckily still available—then motion for the bartender. As soon as I have her attention, I point at my empty glass. She nods.  
  
  “Do you mind if I join you?” I don’t even have to look to know who’s asking that question. My body reacts to him the same way it did seconds ago. Goose bumps break out across my skin, and a shiver slides down my spine. The guy who has suddenly become the object of all my fantasies slides onto the empty stool next to mine.  
  
  “Sure.” I shrug, trying to play it cool.  
  
  He smiles.  
  
  “Wesley.” He leans closer to me, and my breathing goes funny.  
  
  “Pardon?” His grin shows off a perfect smile and straight, white teeth. I’ve never thought teeth were attractive until now, but there is something sexy about his.  
  
  “Name’s Wesley. You are . . . ?” He sticks his large hand out in my direction, and my stomach dances with nervous butterflies as I drop my eyes to it before looking at him once more.  
  
  That’s when I notice that his eyes are blue, but not just any blue. They remind me of the beach out on Long Island near my parents’ house, where I spent most of my childhood.  
  
  “I’m . . . um . . . Mac . . . Mackenzie,” I stutter, placing my hand in his much larger calloused one as I watch him smile.  
  
  “Nice to meet you, Mackenzie.”  
  
  “Uh . . . yeah. Nice to meet you.” I nod, feeling his thumb slide over the pulse at my wrist while our eyes stay locked.  
  
  “Here’s your change, and a fresh drink,” the bartender says, breaking the moment.  
  
  I pull my eyes and hand from Wesley’s as the bartender slides the cash across the top of the bar toward me and sets my new lemon drop down on a fresh napkin.  
  
  “Thank you.” I clear my throat, trying to get myself under control. This proves to be impossibly hard to do since I can feel Wesley’s eyes still on me—as well as his wide-spread knees on either side of my thigh.  
  
  “What are you drinking?” the bartender asks him.  
  
  I pick up my drink, realizing I need to do something with my hands so I won’t fan myself.  
  
  “Bud, in the bottle,” he says.  
  
  I feel his hand come to rest against my lower back and burn into my skin through my sweater.  
  
  I try not to look at him.  
  
  The bartender bends at the waist and straightens back up a second later with a beer in her hand that she sets in front of him after she opens it.  
  
  “Do you want me to start a tab?” she asks.  
  
  I watch in the mirror as he lifts his chin and hands her a credit card. She sets it behind the bar at the register before walking off once more to tend to her other customers.  
  
  “So what brings you here tonight?” Turning my head toward Wesley at his question, I wonder if I should lie. Then I wonder why the hell I’m wondering that since he doesn’t know me anyway. It would make no sense to lie to him.  
  
  “I was supposed to meet someone here for a drink, but he stood me up.”  
  
  “Someone stood you up?” he asks, sounding appalled on my behalf.  
  
  My lips twitch into a smile as I laugh.  
  
  “Yeah.”  
  
  “Idiot.” He shakes his head as his eyes roam over me. He takes a pull from his beer, and my stomach dances once more.  
  
  “Why are you here?” I ask after a moment, needing to fill the silence that has settled between us.  
  
  “I needed a beer.” He nods toward the bottle in his hand. “It was a long day.”  
  
  “Work?” I ask.  
  
  He nods once more as his eyes fill with something I can’t understand yet, but know I don’t like. Something about it makes me feel uneasy, like I want to protect him.  
  
  “Sorry,” I say softly, fighting the urge to reach out and touch him.  
  
  “Don’t be. I’ve got a cold beer in my hand, and I’m talking to a beautiful woman. Gotta say, my day’s looking up.”  
  
  The word beautiful makes me feel a little bit guilty. He has no idea that the woman he’s sitting with isn’t who I really am. I don’t normally look like this or drink martinis. He doesn’t know that I prefer to drink beer and never wear makeup unless I have to. Even the clothes I have on aren’t mine. They’re Libby’s. My closet consists of mostly T-shirts and jeans. I want to tell him all that, but I don’t. Instead, I decide to pretend for a little while longer that I’m someone else, that I’m the kind of woman a man who looks like he does  
would be interested in.  
  
  Two hours later, as I settle into the backseat of a cab with Wesley next to me, I wonder what the hell I’m doing.  
  
  I’ve had only two lovers in my life—both of them long-term boyfriends I didn’t sleep with until months into the relationship. I don’t do one-night stands. Or at least I’ve never had one before, but something came over me when Wesley asked if I wanted to get out of the bar. I don’t even think I realized that something inside me knew if I didn’t go with him, I would regret it for the rest of my life.  
  
  The door slams, and I listen as Wesley gives the driver directions to his place. I’m suddenly unsure of my decision.  
  
  “Hey.” His voice washes over me while his hand moves up my leg to the junction between my thighs.  
  
  My pulse quickens, and white-hot lust shoots through my system. The same lust I’ve been feeling all night. Meeting his gaze, I see that the same lust is staring right back at me. Licking my suddenly dry lips, I watch as his eyes drop to my mouth. A whoosh of breath leaves my lungs as he leans in.  
  
  The first touch of his lips to mine is soft and exploratory—a tease of what’s to come. Touching my tongue to his bottom lip, I feel his chest vibrate against mine. I whimper as he deepens the kiss, thrusting his tongue into my mouth to toy with mine while his hand in the hair at the back of my head tightens and tilts it, sending a sting of desire through me.  
  
  Pulling back when the cab comes to a stop, I pant as he pays the driver. I take his hand when he offers it and allow him to help me out of the backseat. Shutting the door behind us, he keeps my hand firmly in his as we walk down the sidewalk and toward a set of stairs that leads to the bottom level of a townhouse. After he unlocks and opens the door, I start to walk inside ahead of him. He stops me, wraps his hand around my waist, and moves his face close to mine. He’s so close that I can feel his warm breath brush against my lips as he speaks.  
  
  “You sure about this?” he asks.  
  
  My pulse, already thundering away, speeds up.  
  
  “Yes,” I whisper without having to think about my answer. Raising my shaking hands, I run my fingers through his hair. It’s just as soft and as thick as I thought it would be. I pull his mouth down toward mine.  
Groaning, “Fuck,” his mouth captures mine as his hands slide down my back to my ass. He cups it, then lifts me off the ground like I weigh nothing at all. Wrapping my legs around his hips, I moan into his mouth. He walks us into his apartment, kicking the door shut behind us.  
  
  When I blink my eyes open, the early-morning light greets me through the partially opened blinds next to the bed. I realize I’m not home; then I feel the heavy weight of Wesley’s arm draped over my bare waist. I pull in a quiet breath and let it out slowly as I look around. The room is small—just big enough for the queen-size bed I’m lying on and a dresser tucked in the corner. There are no curtains covering the windows or pictures on the walls. There’s nothing to tell me anything about the man I just spent the night with. The man who held me throughout the night, the man still curled around me.  
  
  Worrying my bottom lip, I debate what I should do now that I’m awake. The idea of having to face Wesley when he wakes up sends panic pulsing through my system. I know enough from talking to friends that the morning after is always awkward for both parties, and I want to save us both that experience. Figuring it’s better to get out now, I carefully move out of his grasp. This isn’t easy to do because his hold on me seems to tighten whenever I make any leeway. Finally extracting myself from him and the bed, I quietly get up and search through our clothes—scattered across the floor—until I find my stuff.  
  
  Once I have everything in my arms, I head for the bedroom door. I pause with my hand on the doorknob and look back at the bed. Running my eyes over Wesley’s dark hair, his face relaxed in sleep, and his big, strong body makes something uncomfortable shift in my stomach. It’s like my soul is telling me that I’m an idiot for just taking off and not seeing what will happen if I stick around.  
  
  Shaking off that feeling, I quietly open the door and step out, closing it behind me. Walking into his living-room-slash-kitchen, I put on my clothes as fast as I can. I grab my bag and toss it over my shoulder. Nibbling my bottom lip some more, I wonder if I should leave him a note. I close my eyes at the ridiculousness of the thought. What would it even say? “Thanks for last night?” “It was fun?” Yes, we had a good time, but he had a good time with the Mackenzie who dresses sexy, wears makeup, and drinks martinis. He wasn’t with the real me. Mac the tomboy. The beer drinker, the girl who is always just one of the guys.  
  
  My eyes sting at that realization. I like Wesley, but he has no idea who I really am. I doubt that he would like me if he did.  
  
  As I leave his apartment, I stop at the top of the steps on the sidewalk and look both ways. I’m not far from the train, so instead of getting a cab like I planned on doing, I make my way toward the subway station at the end of the block. I swipe my MetroCard, then take the stairs down into the mostly empty platform.  
  
  Since it’s Saturday, I know it might be a while before my train arrives. I take a seat on one of the benches lining the wall, then dig through my bag for my phone and come up empty-handed. I close my eyes and grit my teeth.  
  
  I know I had my phone when I was with Wesley because I sent a text to Libby to let her know not to worry about me. I typed that message in Wesley’s bed while he tried to distract me with his mouth and hands, something he succeeded in doing two seconds after I pressed “Send.”  
  
  Groaning, I drop my face to my hands. I left it back at his place.  
  
  “Now what?” I ask myself aloud.  
  
  I can’t go back and knock on his door. I would look like a complete idiot if I did that.  
  
  What would I say? “Hey! I just snuck out of your bed and apartment, but I came back because I think I left my phone behind. Can I come in and search for it?”  
  
  “Google is the answer.” Pulling my hands away from my face, I sit back and look at the man standing in front of me. His white hair is wild and sticking out in every direction, his face is pale, and his clothes are dirty and torn. “Google is always the answer. Follow Google.”  
  
  He twists his neck back and forth as he gets closer to where I’m sitting. Seeing the way his eyes are dilated and the pulse in his neck is thumping away, I know he’s high. Meaning he’s unstable. My dad has always told me never to show fear, never to allow anyone to think they can intimidate me. That has always stuck with me. I raise my chin, and he stops moving, but I don’t relax. I know better than to let my guard down. Sliding my hand into the pocket of my coat, I wrap my fingers tightly around my can of mace and stand up.  
  
  He doesn’t move, but his eyes stay locked on me as I slowly back away from him down the platform toward a young couple who is making out and an older gentleman who is reading the paper. Hearing the sound of the train rushing through the tunnel, I sigh in relief when I see that it’s mine. As soon as the train stops and the doors open, I get into a crowded car and take a seat across from the doors. I watch them shut as the train pulls away.  
  
  A flash of black catches my attention, and I turn my head. My eyes widen when I see Wesley. He’s wearing a pair of gray sweats, a black hoodie, and sneakers—and he’s running down the platform after my train. I stand without thinking, and his disappointed eyes meet mine through the window right before he disappears out of sight as we head into the tunnel.  
  
  Taking my seat again, I close my eyes, lean my head back, and tuck my purse in front of my stomach. I hold it there tightly, trying to stop a wave of nausea.  
  
  He came after me.  
  
  I don’t know how he knew I would be getting on the train, but he did.  
  
  He came after me. Or at least I think he did.  
  
  I furrow my brow, then feel my heart plummet when I realize he probably found my phone and was just trying to catch me so he could return it. Opening my eyes again, I take a deep breath. I need to figure out how to get my phone from him. It will be more awkward than waking up with him, but I can’t afford to buy a new one.  
  
  As soon as I reach my stop, I head up the steps out of the station and then walk the three blocks to my place. Libby and I share a one-bedroom apartment on the second floor of a three-family house. The house is a traditional New York City brownstone, with a wide stoop in the front. In the summer, I sit there and watch the kids in the neighborhood play as I drink my coffee in the mornings.  
  
  I got the apartment when I moved to New York. It was the only thing I ever had that was just mine, the first thing I didn’t have to share with my sisters. Well, until Fawn came to the city to go to college. Libby joined us not long after that. Thankfully, Fawn no longer lives with us. I love my sisters, but the three of us sharing the small space led to a lot of fights.  
  
  As soon as I’m inside the foyer, I stop at the mailboxes and open mine. Pulling out a handful of mostly junk mail, I see Miss Ina open her apartment door an inch to peek out to see who’s in the hall. Doing the nice thing, I give her a smile. I regret it instantly, because she takes it as an invitation to open the door completely. Miss Ina is eighty years old, a tiny thing with a humpback that makes her appear even smaller than she already is. Her white hair looks like a big puffy cloud on top of her head, and her frail skin is practically transparent, but her brown eyes are so dark, they look almost black. I swear when she looks at you, it’s like she’s looking into your soul. Scanning it for all the wrongs you’ve done in your life. Nothing happens in the house without her knowing about it. She knows everyone’s business—sometimes before they even do.  
  
  “We need to talk,” she says as she pushes her walker in front of her and moves out into the entryway.  
  
  “How can I help you, Miss Ina?” I ask, watching her hobble closer with her walker squeaking as she sidles up to me.  
  
  “I can’t sleep with all the banging around upstairs.”  
  
  “Miss Ina, we’ve talked about this. The house is old. It’s not soundproof. Libby and I both try to be quiet, but you can’t expect us to tiptoe around upstairs all the time,” I say as nicely as I can.  
  
  She huffs. I do feel bad for her. I know exactly what she’s going through, since there’s a family who lives above us with three small children. We can hear everything they  
do upstairs—and I mean everything—from the kids playing with cars on the floor to Mrs. and Mr. Kind’s bed banging against the wall at night as they work on a fourth baby.  
  
  “I need my rest. You girls need to be more considerate of your neighbors,” she says.  
  
  I sigh. I’ve been down this road with her enough times to know that she won’t give up until I agree, even if I don’t really agree with her.  
  
  I give in. “We will try to be quieter.”  
  
  She huffs again in response. Giving up on making her happy because it’s impossible, I tuck my mail into my bag and scoot around her and her walker. I move toward the stairs.  
  
  “Have a great day, Miss Ina!” I call over my shoulder when I’m halfway up the first flight. She doesn’t respond—not that I expected her to.  
  
  Unlocking the door to my apartment, I push it open and listen to it groan. I step inside and shut it behind me. Okay, I slam it a little to get it to close—and to piss off Ina. I shrug off my purse and jacket, then lay both of them on the couch. Next, I take off my boots and drop them to the floor near the couch. The apartment is small, just about four hundred square feet. The living room is just inside the front door and is barely big enough for the couch that sits under the pass-through window into the kitchen. The TV is directly across from it. The kitchen is also tiny, but it works for Libby and me since neither of us can cook. The apartment might not be fabulous, but the bathroom is amazing—or rather, my bathtub is. The old claw-foot tub is the only reason I haven’t moved out.  
  
  Knowing Libby is at work, I start to undress as I make my way into the bathroom. I have always loved taking baths, and a bath is exactly what I need to relax after the morning’s excitement. Filling up the tub, I dump a handful of bath salts into the water, then climb in. After an hour of soaking, I get out and put on a pair of sweats and a T-shirt. I plant myself on the couch in front of the TV with a bowl of Cheerios. I tell myself that I won’t worry about getting my phone back from Wesley until after the weekend.  
  
  But I do worry, and when I’m not worrying, I spend every moment thinking about him.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  THAT SO WASN’T PART OF THE PLAN  
  
  MAC  
  
  Over the past few days, I’ve thought of a hundred different ways I might be able to get my phone back from Wesley without actually having to see him face-to-face. First I thought about breaking into his place and stealing it, but I don’t think that would go over well—he would know it was me if all that was missing was my phone. I also thought about asking my sisters to help me out by dressing up like cable repair workers, but they would ask too many questions, so I don’t bother. I was at a loss until this morning when an idea came to me—a lame idea, but an idea all the same.  
  
  After I got ready, I left my place and made a couple of stops before getting on the train to Wesley’s. When I reach the steps in front of his apartment, I look around to make sure the coast is clear before taking the stairs down to his door. I drop my purse on the bottom step, and I get out the note I wrote, the prepaid envelope I just bought, and some clear packing tape. I unroll a section of tape, press the envelope and note to the door, then tape across the top of them. Realizing I have to use my teeth to rip the tape because I don’t have scissors, I get up on my tiptoes to bite it. It’s too high for me to reach with my mouth. As I start to pull the envelope from the door, the roll of tape falls from my grasp and hits the ground, then rolls away from me.  
  
  “Dammit!” I hiss as it wraps around itself and my hand. Ripping the envelope off the door, I try to untangle myself from the mess of clear packing tape, cringing at the obnoxious noise it makes.  
  
  “Do you need some help?”  
  
  “Shit!” I shout as I spin around.  
  
  When I look up, my eyes meet Wesley’s. He’s more gorgeous than I remember. He also looks slightly annoyed, with his arms crossed over his massive chest and his blue eyes locked on me.  
  
  “You’re here . . . ,” I say like an idiot, feeling my face get hot.  
  
  “I live here.” He lifts his chin toward the door. “What are you doing here?”  
  
  “I . . . I was just in the neighborhood,” I lie while wrapping the tape into a ball around the roll in my hands.  
  
  Moving his eyes from my face to the roll of tape in my hands, he asks, “What were you doing?”  
  
  “I was . . .” My words taper off as he drops his eyes to the ground. He bends down to pick up the note I was going to leave him.  
  
  Wesley, sorry I missed you. I think I left my phone behind when we hung out. Can you put it in the envelope and drop it in the nearest mailbox?  
  
  Thank you, Mackenzie  
  
  He reads it aloud. My cheeks, which were already hot, burn hotter as he lifts his head to look at me.  
  
  “Did you ring the bell?” he asks.  
  
  I look at the door behind me, then back at him.  
  
  “Bell?”  
  
  “The doorbell—did you ring it?”  
  
  “Um . . .”  
  
  “It’s hooked up to my cell phone, so when someone rings the bell, my phone rings.”  
  
  “Maybe it’s broken?” I suggest lamely, tipping my head to the side and hoping I look innocent.  
  
  He takes two steps down, presses the button, and his phone chimes immediately.  
  
  Darn it.  
  
  “Doesn’t seem broken to me.” He turns around to face me, his huge body making the small alcove we’re in seem even smaller.  
  
  Knowing I don’t have a good excuse, I keep my mouth closed. My eyes widen involuntarily as he closes the minute distance between us with his eyes locked on mine.  
  
  “Wesley . . . ,” I breathe when his familiar scent fills my lugs. His warmth seems to wrap around me even though he doesn’t touch me.  
  
  “You slipped out on me. Why?” The question is soft, but there is no mistaking the annoyance and frustration in his voice or his eyes as he waits for my answer.  
  
  I won’t be giving him an honest answer, because saying why I left the way I did out loud would be ridiculous now that I’m standing in front of him.  
  
  “I . . . fuck”—he rips his hand through his hair—“I can’t believe you just took off without a word.”  
  
  My eyes close briefly. I open my mouth to say something, anything.  
  
  Before I can, he cuts me off with a shake of his head and a sharp “Never mind.”  
  
  Turning his back to me, he opens the door and goes inside. I swallow the mass of emotions I’m feeling as I stand in the open doorway, wondering what I should do next. Pulling in a much-needed breath, I shove the ball of tape into my bag and pick it up before moving into his apartment. I didn’t really stop to look around the last time I was here. Seeing it now, I realize I didn’t miss out on much. The kitchen is small, with only a round table and two chairs in the middle of it. In the living room, there is a row of boxes stacked up against the wall, a big comfortable-looking gray couch, and a large TV on a plain black stand. The whole space is empty of anything personal—there are no pictures or anything else to make it homey. I wonder if they are in the boxes still to be unpacked.  
  
  “Here,” he rumbles, holding out my phone.  
  
  Turning to face him, I reach out slowly and take my phone. I shove it in the pocket of my jacket while I avoid his eyes.  
  
  “Thank you.”  
  
  “Sure.”  
  
  “I’m sorry,” I say quietly. “I . . .”  
  
  “I don’t want to hear it,” he replies, cutting me off before I can say more.  
  
  I fight the urge to flinch.  
  
  “I don’t want to hear whatever bullshit excuse you’re going to try to feed me.”  
  
  “Excuse me?” I lift my head to look at him.  
  
  “You heard me.” He holds my stare.  
  
  I feel my eyes narrow, and his do the same in return.  
  
  “You got your phone. That’s why you came, right? So why are you still standing here?”  
  
  “Wow.” I shake my head, pull my eyes away from his. “You’re a dick.”  
  
  “You couldn’t get enough of my dick the other night, baby. If I remember corre  
ctly, you begged me for it more than once,” he says.  
  
  My head snaps back toward him. “Jerk!” I hiss, lifting a hand to smack him.  
  
  He catches it before I make contact. I lift my other hand to try again, but he catches that one, too, and then pulls them both up above my head. Breathing heavily, I stare at him. He stares back.  
  
  “Now what?” he says with a smirk.  
  
  I do the only thing I can think of. I raise myself up on my tiptoes and press my mouth to his. I expect my move to knock him off balance—and down a peg or two—but that doesn’t happen. Instead, his mouth captures mine, and his tongue slips between my parted lips. I don’t fight the kiss. Just like last time, I discover I want this more than I want anything. I want him.  
  
  Releasing one of my hands, he wraps his arm around my waist and pulls me flush against him. His mouth travels down my jaw to my neck. He bites it softly, making my toes curl. Feeling the pull of arousal deep in my belly, I tug at his shirt until it’s free from his jeans, then run my hand up his abs before dragging my nails down over the ridges and valleys there.  
  
  “Wesley . . . ,” I whimper as his tongue flicks across my neck.  
  
  The next thing I know, his breath whispers across the shell of my ear.  
  
  “Tell me you want this.” He presses his erection into my stomach, letting me know he’s ready to repeat what happened the other night. “Tell me you want me.”  
  
  “I want you,” I moan just as his mouth captures mine once more.  
  
  His hands rip at my clothes, and mine do the same to his in return. Hearing my jacket and top hit the floor, I urge his shirt up and over his head, then move my hands to the button of his jeans. He walks us backward, toward his room. He gets his pants down over his hips before he pulls away from me.  
  
  “Kick off your shoes.” With a jerky nod, I work my feet out of my sneakers. I bite my lip as he pulls down my pants and panties in one move, then slides his hands up my thighs, along my sides, and then around my back to remove my bra. He lets it fall to the floor without a second glance.  
  
  Standing completely naked in front of him, I fight the urge to hide myself from his heated gaze as it roams over every inch of me. It makes me feel hot and restless.

The room had a grey ambience, almost like a foggy Greenhouse. It was different from most interrogation rooms, The light dangled from the ceiling like a spider from a web. Every second was counted, every sound was recorded. A dark, tinted window was engraved into the right side of the wall. People watched through it, taking notes as they listened carefully to what the witness had to say. Two men were sitting at the grey laminate table. One man donned a mustache with a suit and tie as well as hands full of files and classified documents. The man sitting right across from him had a terrified look on his face, avoiding eye contact while looking down at his fidgeting hands. “Lutenant Carter Rowel, you were aboard the U.S.S. Irvine On July the first, 2011 is that correct?” The Interrogator glanced at Lieutenant Rowel with darting eyes. “Yes sir, that is correct.” Rowel responded. “On the night of July the first, 2011 did you see an unidentified aircraft in your airspace?” The Interrogator asked to clarify Rowels extraordinary claim. “Yes sir, that is correct.” Rowel responded once again. “Can you describe this object you witnessed on the night of July the first?”

July 1st, 2011 - 7:08 AM (The account of Carter Rowel)

“My name is Lieutenant Carter Jacob Rowel. I am a Naval RD Currently aboard the U.S.S. Irvine off the coast of California. My board number is 6893. I am writing to report a series of strange radar signals I received earlier this morning. We tried restarting the Radar, but the signals didn't disappear. If anything they were more clear. I am reporting to make sure there are no unauthorized drones in the area that we are unaware of.  -Sincerely Jacob Rowel.” I sent this message to the Our Naval company director earlier this morning. It was my job to monitor and track any flying objects within our airspace. Every Naval fighter plane, ship, or military aircraft is marked on the radar as being one of ours. Each one of them has an aircraft number linked to a specific plane. When an Aircraft enters our airspace and is not marked as one of our own, then that Aircraft is considered an unknown. Usually we are able to get in contact with these aircrafts via radio. They often turn out to be a foreign plane that has headed off course, or an Aircraft that we forgot to mark as our own. But this time when I tried getting into contact with these Unknown Aircrafts. “34, 34, This is the U.S.S Irvine, do you copy-Over?” There was no response. The Radar showed three Plane sized objects 20 miles East of the ship. “34, 34, This is the U.S.S Irvine, do you copy-Over?” Once again, there was no response. I then notified the attorney general of this strange occurrence. “Sir, come look at this.” The attorney general walked over quickly. “What is it?” He asked intently. “Theres three unknown aircraft in our airspace. I tried radioing them, but I got no response.” The Attorney General looked at the static Radar. “Radio over one more time.” He ordered. “34, 34, This is the U.S.S Irvine, do you copy-Over?” Once again all I heard was white noise, with no further response. I once again glanced at the green flashing radar. I noticed that they had to be planes since they were traveling at over 500 mph. “That's weird, most planes in our airspace would have responded by now.” I noted. “Maybe their Radio is jacked up and they headed off course.” Said the attorney general. Things got even weirder once I looked back at the radar and checked the velocity panel. It appeared that the objects were descending from space, and then dropping down to sea level in a matter of seconds. I've been monitoring radars for 3 years, and I have never seen anything like this before.

	The Mustached Man took a careful sip of his hot coffee. The room was even more silent than the day before. The security guard opened the door for a new subject to be integrated, by the name of Lieutenant Joseph Jesmine. “Please take a seat.” The Mustached Man insisted. “Now, state your name and your occupation.” The room went silent for a moment. “My name is Lieutenant Joseph R. Jesmine. I Was a fighter pilot aboard the U.S.S. Irvine on July the first, 2011.” The Mustached man pushed his glasses back up onto his nose. “On July the first, 2011. You claimed that you almost came into contact with one of these Unknown Aircrafts, is this true?” The Lieutenant looked at the man as if he was reminiscing about what happened. “Yes sir, that is correct.” The Mustached man took a sip of his coffee once again. “How would you describe this aircraft Lieutenant?” The Lieutenant paused for a moment. “Sir, you're going to think I'm crazy.” He said quietly. “But I know damn well what I saw, and it wasn't a plane.”

July 1st, 2011 - 9:30 AM (The Account of Joseph Jesmine)

	I received a message from the Attorney General earlier this morning. The message read- ""Lieutenant Jesmine. We have received strange radar signals of unknown aircraft in our airspace. You have been given orders to fly up there and check out what's in our airspace. We tried to contact them with a radio signal, but we got no response. You will take off at 09:50 flat. And head East of the ship. - Attorney General Groves.” I looked at the time and realized I would have to get ready for take off soon. I had never done a mission like this before, so I didn't really know what to expect. Nevertheless I packed up my gear, and headed up onto the runway upstairs. I fly a Single manned F-18 fighter jet, along with my wingman Jordon; codenamed- “Rush Hour”. I see Jordon near his plane manually installing his new 360 wing camera. “Yo Jordon, We got orders to check out these planes that are near our airspace.” I yelled overhead. “What? Are they Russians?” Jordan asked jokingly. “I dont know, maybe it's some unmarked drones for all I know. We’re supposed to leave right now, so call for a takeoff spot.” I said as I began heading towards my jet. Once I got in my jet I began radioing over to air traffic control. “This is Raven, requesting for takeoff-Over?” I look over to see Aircraft Marshals taking their positions. “Copy that Raven you are free for a spot-Over?” I start up my low engine and begin moving to my spot down the runway. “This is air traffic control, you are clear for Takeoff.” I full-throttle my fuel as the Hook on the back of my plane detaches. I take off smoothly with a minor bump as I exit the runway. The skin on my face begins to pull back from the G-forces. As I gain altitude, I see Jordan's plane overhead. “Raven, this is Rush Hour; do you copy-Over?” I turn my radio on and respond. “Copy that Rush Hour, head 20 miles east.” As we align our planes, I keep my eye on the Radar; waiting until I have sight of the Aircrafts. 
After around 10 minutes of circling the area, I finally got a ping on my Radar. “This is Raven, I have something on my Radar-Over?” “Roger that Raven, what is it you see-Over?” I look back down on my radar. “I see three green dots, it looks like they're just sitting there-Over?” “How is that possible?” Jordan asked. “They must not be planes then-Over?” I look back at my Radar screen. Suddenly, The Dots dart off quickly away from my screen. “What the fuck?” I say aloud. “Rush Hour, This is Raven. I lost sight of them-Over?” “What the Hell do you mean you lost sight of them? You said they were just sitting there-Over?”I scan my eyes quickly across the radar, only to find nothing but an empty, black slate. “They were just sitting there a moment ago, and then they darted off my screen, I dont know what happened-Over?” 

“Maybe your Radars Malfunctioning-Over” Jordan suggested. “My radar couldn't have been broken, I did a radar check this morning.” I thought to myself. “But what other explanation do I have?” I thought that maybe The Radar wave was being slower because of the wave disruption coming from the ship. “It's probably a radio wave disruption-Over?” Suddenly, I hear a loud crack as my radar shuts off completely.  “Hey what the Fuck!?” I yell out of confusion. “Hey, my radio shut off and I can't get it back on-Over?” I get no response. “Rush Hour, this is Raven; do you copy-Over?” Once again, I get no response. Usually I would use my radar to look for Jordan, but since I can't turn it on I completely lost sight of him. “Rush Hour, this is Raven; do you copy-Over?” As I fly straight, a silver object abruptly zooms past my jet, almost colliding with one of my wings. “Wow, what the Hell?!” The almost mid air collision suddenly makes me tense, as my heart rate rises. “U.S.S Irvine, This is Raven; Something almost hit me-Over?” Once again, I get no response. All I hear is a magnitude of white noise coming from my headphones. I am completely lost without a radar signal, and I notice that I am running out of fuel fast. “U.S.S Irvine, This is Raven. My radar is broken, my wingman is missing, and I am running out of fuel fast. I need to get back and refuel ASAP-Over?” I continue to get no feedback from the Radio. As I listen for a response, I see something out of the corner of my eye. I look over to see a silver object moving in the opposite direction. It was farther away this time, so I was able to get a closer look at the thing. It looked like a flying piece of metal, with no visible propulsion. “It had to be some sort of drone.” I thought. I decided to circle back around to follow it. As it moved on a straight path, I followed closely behind, watching it with awe. All of a sudden, the object began to speed up profusely. I began turning my throttle to speed up along with it. “Im not letting you go this time!” I say aloud. The object continues to speed up, getting faster and faster by the second. I pull the throttle all the way back and try to keep up with its acceleration, but it's just too fast. “Come on! Come!” I feel the G-Forces pressing on my chest as I go as fast as my body can handle. But it's just not fast enough. The object accelerates into super sonic speed as I begin to feel the blood rush to the back of my brain. My vision begins to go dark, as I begin to go unconscious. But then suddenly, it all stops. My body begins to feel perfectly still. As I opened my eyes, I realized that  the jet had stopped moving. I was suspended in the air, as if time had frozen. I then look up over the head of my cockpit, and I see it. The Silver Object, Just floating over my window. It was as if the object was keeping my plane suspended in the air with some sort of Unknown force. I looked at the object closer than ever. It was a large silver prism like shape, no larger than my Jet. As I looked at it longer, I noticed that it shined a bright green color; almost too bright to look at. I will never forget that shine. That Green Neon shine, brighter than the sun.

“It had a green shine you said?” asked the Mustached Man. “Yes. sir” The Lieutenant responded. The Mustached Man began to take notes on a clippboarded piece of paper. “And what happened to your Wingmate?” He asked. “No one ever heard from him since that day, I still dont know what happened to him. There was a search mission sent out to recover his aircraft, but they found nothing.” Explained the Lieutenant. “Now about the aircraft, Are you sure this wasn't some sort of drone?” The Mustached Man asked. “Sir, I know what a drone looks like. They either have wings, a propeller; or some sort of propulsion. This thing had nothing. It was a static object, just floating there. An object with no windows, no labels; just a shape, A floating shape of unknown origin. And whatever it was, it wanted to be left alone.”

  May - Austin, Texas  
  
  Wasn’t regret a bitch? In fact, Jesse McCall couldn’t remember another time in his life when it had come off its leash and humped his leg so thoroughly.  
  
  As he emerged from the modern, mostly glass hotel, flashbulbs burst in his face, blinding him. He paused as reporters shouted questions his way. Beside him, his shark of a publicist, Candia, barked “no comment” in a nonstop loop as she led him to the waiting limo at the end of the crowded walk.  
  
  Jesse glanced at the big blue sky. Late afternoon blistered. Had it already been more than twelve hours since everything had gone so wrong? Why hadn’t he asked more questions or hung around longer? Something that might have prevented this fucking tragedy…  
  
  Raking a hand through his hair, he squinted as he dragged his gaze over the surrounding skyscrapers. He was in some downtown area. Austin. Yeah. Half the time he woke up and didn’t know what day it was, what city he’d preformed in, or who the hell he was lying next to. The life of a musician was frenetic and nomadic. Jesse had sold out one stadium tour after another since age sixteen. Twelve years later, he didn’t know any other way to live.  
  
  He reached into his pocket and tossed on a pair of Armani shades, thanking god he wasn’t hung over. A year of sobriety had ensured that, but still Candia strode beside him on her usual platforms, tense and waiting to flay him alive with her tongue the second they were alone.  
  
  When the limo driver opened the door of the sleek black stretch, Jesse climbed in behind his publicist as she settled into the leather seat and smoothed back the professional twist of her dark hair. Their chauffeur enclosed them together in the back of the car, and Jesse counted down to Candia’s imminent explosion.  
  
  “Damn it, we’re still on tour. The album just dropped last week.” She tossed her gray Prada briefcase onto the floorboard and shot him a frustrated stare. “The bad-boy image has always worked for you because you’re young and hot. But the public will view this as over the line. You want to give me the whole story now?”  
  
  As if she hadn’t heard every word he’d told the pair of detectives over the last three hours. Did she honestly think he’d held back? The interview had finally ended when they’d realized he knew nothing and hadn’t been in any way involved. Then the paunch-bellied one with the scowl had asked him to sign an autograph for his teenage daughter. With a few strokes of his pen, Jesse had been out the door.  
  
  “It’s already public knowledge?” He’d hoped she could keep a lid on this until he could figure out what to do, how to process, what to say.  
  
  “TMZ and Perez Hilton are all over this shit. You even made CNN.”  
  
  So that was a yes. He sighed. “I swear, I don’t know anything else. After the show last night, Ryan caught me as I was leaving my suite. He said he’d met a girl and asked to borrow my room since he couldn’t find the key to his own. He was in too much of a hurry to get under her miniskirt to fetch another one from the front desk.”  
  
  Of course Ryan had invited him to join in, too. Girls and drugs, just like the good ol’ days. Jesse had declined and begged Ryan to come with him. No dice.  
  
  “Then you went out for a ride?” Candia asked.  
  
  He nodded. “Cruising around on my motorcycle helps clear my head after a show.”  
  
  And kept him away from the partying that had nearly ruined him over ten years of his career.  
  
  “Did you get a good look at her before you left?”  
  
  “You mean, did I know she was only sixteen? No. I barely glanced at her but I would have pegged her at well over twenty-one.” Definitely not a sophomore in high school.  
  
  “If you’d made him go to the lobby, maybe someone would have stopped him… Maybe he would have used the head up north.” She pressed her thumb between her eyebrows, obviously fighting off a headache. “Maybe… But it’s done.”  
  
  He wanted to be pissed that Candia had put this off on him, but she hadn’t voiced anything he hadn’t already thought. “At the time, I figured if Ryan was screwing some cute blonde, maybe he wasn’t getting high.”  
  
  Jesse scoffed at the terrible irony of that.  
  
  “Oh, he absolutely was. And he got her high, too.”  
  
  Yes, his bandmate and old buddy had overdosed the girl—in Jesse’s room. So naturally, everyone assumed he’d been involved.  
  
  “The press is having a field day.” At barely four thirty in the afternoon, Candia already sounded damn tired.  
  
  Jesse could guess who they’d cast in the role of scapegoat, even though he hadn’t been in the building when Ryan had pumped his jailbait hookup full of heroin and taken her to bed. Then, once his backup vocalist had realized the girl was unresponsive, he hadn’t called 911 for medical help so she might have lived. No. He’d apparently panicked and shot himself in the head, doubling the tragedy.  
  
  Besides being a PR nightmare, Jesse had lost a friend he’d been trying to save. And the staggered, grief-stricken looks on the faces of that girl’s parents when they realized their daughter was gone would haunt him forever.  
  
  “So, I guess social media is firing up with condemnation and hate.” He stared out the window at the thick traffic.  
  
  “Enough to make me nervous. You’ve got sympathy from the hard-core fans but… We have to cancel the rest of the tour,” she murmured. “The noise is too negative. You look like an insensitive asshat if you continue on as if nothing terrible has happened.”  
  
  “We had six shows left.” It could have been more, but he wished it had been fewer.  
  
  “Yep. That’s well over a hundred thousand disappointed fans. And those are merely the ones who held tickets. It sucks.” She hesitated. “You’ll be thirty in less than eighteen months. I’m starting to think the time has come to tone down your bad-boy-gone-wild image.”  
  
  She was right. Jesse didn’t bother asking if his parents would be proud. They’d cashed out on his fame years ago. His dad now played golf with celebrities. His mom trained other stage parents and gave interviews about where they’d gone wrong with their only son. He hadn’t talked to them in forever. But none of that mattered at the moment. Bottom line, Jesse wasn’t proud of himself.  
  
  He hadn’t been in a long time.  
  
  “We need a distraction,” she told him. “You should start an anti-gun crusade.”  
  
  Jesse shook his head. “Too political.”  
  
  “What about a series of PSAs about suicide prevention?”  
  
  “Ryan didn’t want to take his own life. He was simply too high to realize he shouldn’t. Besides, doing either of those things will look like I know I should have done more.”  
  
  Candia gave him a deflated sigh, then began chewing on her bottom lip as if sorting through the problem. “I’ll keep working on solutions.”  
  
  “While you think about my public image, find out how we can help the Harris girl’s family, like providing funeral expenses or whatever else they need.” He paused. “Have my lawyers work up a confidential settlement and set these folks up for life.”  
  
  “But you had nothing to do with her death.”  
  
  “All those parents know is that the last time their daughter walked out the door, she was coming to my concert. She’ll never be home again because of the choices my bandmate made. They will never recover from that loss.”  
  
  Candia got quiet. “I’ll take care of it.”  
  
  “Great. I appreciate you coming with me to talk to the rest of the band.” They’d all been devastated but not stunned when he’d broken the news. “And when the police contact Ryan’s parents and you get the details of his funeral, let me know.”  
  
  She nodded. “Absolutely.”  
  
  “Thanks. So…I guess you’re canceling my appearances for a while?” When she nodded, the care  
er-driven part of him grimaced. The rest of him exhaled in guilty relief. He hadn’t had a day off in years.  
  
  “I’m afraid you won’t be visiting Jimmy Fallon with this album,” she quipped. “I think it’s better if we proactively back out on these appearances for now, citing grief over the loss of your friend. We’ll have an easier time rebooking in a couple of weeks, once this crap has died down.”  
  
  “Wait. Maybe I should use those appearances to tell everyone that I had nothing to do with it.” But he couldn’t deny that on plenty of nights in the past, it could have been him—and everyone knew it. The fact that Maddy Harris had died in his hotel room simply splashed another stain on his already bad reputation. And it sure as hell made him feel shitty, too. What a waste of life…  
  
  “That’s not what they want to hear. ‘Rock Star Overdoses Underage Fan on Sex and Heroin’ makes for a juicier headline. Until the police finish their investigation and release the details, people will assume you had a hand in the incident.”  
  
  He sighed. “So what do you want me to do?”  
  
  “I’m going to issue a statement expressing your grief and deepest apologies to the Harris family. You’re going to disappear—way off the radar—until I say otherwise. No swanky resorts. No high-profile outings with Taylor Swift. And absolutely no intoxication. Think sober monk.”  
  
  No one would ever believe that.  
  
  “I’ve got it.” She snapped her fingers and excitement lit her eyes. “You can go to rehab.”  
  
  Jesse scowled. “I’m not an addict.”  
  
  “But it would look good. Repentant.”  
  
  “It would also be pointless. Everyone goes to rehab and no one cares. No.” He glared her way. “If I hole up, this dies down.”  
  
  “All right,” she said grudgingly as the limo stopped in front of the executive airport outside the city. “But I don’t want to see a Twitter or Instagram pic of you for at least the next two weeks. Once we’re back in L.A., hide out in your house. That should work. I’ll tell you when it’s safe to come out.”  
  
  His ultra-contemporary house was decorated with every luxury and technological delight known to man, not to mention blessed with sick city and ocean views. But it had never felt like home. Despite the place being eight thousand square feet, Jesse couldn’t imagine being cooped up there for the next fourteen days. It would only remind him of everything wrong with his life.  
  
  “Paparazzi know where I live. If I get on that plane with you and go to L.A., they’ll figure it out. So will fans.” Even now, he imagined that if he looked at his phone he’d find a full voicemail box and hundreds of text messages. He couldn’t deal with anyone else’s expectations right now when he’d done so poorly at meeting his own. “If you really want me to disappear, we’ll have to come up with another plan.”  
  
  “You’re well known on every continent but Antarctica. The press would spot you almost anywhere you travel, especially if you take a security detail. They seem to have eyes and ears at every airport. I…” Candia huffed. “I need to think about this.”  
  
  “I’ll give it some brain power too, come up with a few ideas.” Though he had no idea what to suggest, Jesse did know that what he’d done in the past—disappearing into the bottom of a bottle with some recreational blow and a woman under each arm—wasn’t going to do a damn thing to clean up his image.  
  
  “Ideas?” She sounded as if that horrified her. “You? No.”  
  
  “I’m a grown-ass man. And I’ve learned a few things over the years.” He lowered his sunglasses and stared at her over the rims. “Go. You handle the press. I think I might know how to disappear.”  
  
  When the driver opened the limo door, Candia grabbed her bag and turned to him. “You sure? Can I really trust you not to fuck this up?”  
  
  “Yeah. I know how much is on the line. Call me when the coast is clear.”  
  
  \* \* \* \*  
  
  Jesse wiped his palms down the front of his jeans, then rang the doorbell. Hell, he didn’t even know if Kimber was home. And that scary bastard she’d married—had it really been almost five years ago?—wouldn’t be thrilled to see his wife’s ex-fiancé, especially this late at night. If he was lucky, Deke Trenton would slam the door in his face. More likely, the big operative would try to beat the shit out of him.  
  
  After a gut-tightening moment, the porch light flipped on and the door swept open.  
  
  Deke towered in the doorway, a beefy forearm braced against the jamb, blue eyes raking him with a scathing glare. Then Kimber’s husband sighed and looked over his shoulder, back into the living room. “Kitten, your personal Bieber has decided to drop in.”  
  
  “Jesse?” He heard her familiar voice.  
  
  Deke stepped back, and she appeared in the doorway a moment later. Well, her pregnant belly edged into view. The rest of her followed an instant later. He hadn’t talked to her in so long, he hadn’t even known she was pregnant again. Didn’t that make him feel even more like a shit?  
  
  Deke wrapped an arm around her—both a reminder and a warning. Jesse was relieved that seeing the man’s hands on her no longer made him twenty kinds of jealous.  
  
  “Oh my gosh!” Kimber’s hazel eyes widened as she pulled him into a quick hug. “You really are here.”  
  
  Jesse held her in return for something slightly longer than a moment.  
  
  “Yeah. Sorry to drop by without calling.” Clearly, he was intruding on their happy domestic scene.  
  
  “Not at all. Come in.” She opened the door wider and stepped back.  
  
  He could have sworn he heard Deke growl. But the guy let Jesse enter. Now that he’d interrupted their evening, he’d talk fast, thank them, and be gone.  
  
  As he cleared the foyer, flashes of light told him the TV was on, but he suspected it had been muted because he didn’t hear a sound coming from the box. Children’s toys filled baskets and shelves around the room—balls, books, trucks, stuffed animals. Kimber had given birth to a son almost four years ago and was obviously about to be a mother again.  
  
  “Sit.” She waved him over to the couch. “Can I get you something? Water? Coffee?”  
  
  Reluctantly, he sank into a chair, leaving the couch for the two of them. “No thanks. How are you?”  
  
  “Pregnant. It’s a girl this time.” She smoothed her hand over her distended belly with a serene smile. “I’m due at the end of next month. Otherwise, I’m fine.”  
  
  “And you’re on bed rest until then so you don’t go into premature labor again. Feet up.” Deke hustled her back to the sofa and lifted her lower legs and placed her heels on a pillow strategically positioned on top of the coffee table. Then the man pinned Jesse with a stare, shaking his head. “So I’m guessing this isn’t a social call. Your buddy Ryan fucked up and bit it last night.”  
  
  Kimber gasped, then elbowed her husband. “Deke!”  
  
  “Am I wrong?” Deke looked his way.  
  
  Jesse raked at his hair. He hated wearing it to his shoulders and filled with “product.” The stylist he paid a small fortune for insisted it looked both cool and hot. Same with the scruff on his face. Sometimes he just wanted it all gone. “Nope. I wasn’t there.”  
  
  “Access Hollywood suggested something similar about an hour ago,” she said.  
  
  “Which I don’t watch,” Deke cut in. “You came here for a reason. What do you need?”  
  
  Tugging at his ear, Jesse grimaced. These damn earrings weren’t him, either. Crap, he shouldn’t have come here. He didn’t want to risk bringing the press down on them, especially if Kimber was having a difficult pregnancy. She didn’t need the stress.  
  
  “Nothing.” He stood. “You’ve got your hands full. I assume your son is in bed. And I… I’ll figure it out.”  
  
  “You need a place to go?” Deke barked.  
  
  Jesse opened his mouth to admit that’s why he’d come, then he snapped it shut again. Deke’s buddy Jack had some isolated cabin deep in a swamp, and it sure would come in handy about now. But Jesse hadn’t done anything for himself since fame had hit—not kept his schedule, answered his calls, or styled his hair. Hell, he  
’d barely wiped his own ass. Simply rehabbing his image wouldn’t cut it. As Candia had suggested, the time had come for him to change everything.  
  
  He was too damn unhappy to spend the rest of his life this way.  
  
  “No. I’ve got a place in mind,” he lied. “Before I headed that way, I wanted to spend time with someone who…” Knows I’m not the sort of man to corrupt and overdose a teenager. But one of the last times he’d seen Kimber, she’d walked in to find him balls deep in an intoxicated, barely legal girl while chugging a fifth of bourbon. Deke must know that. “Someone who wouldn’t bullshit me. Someone with a solid word of advice.”  
  
  “Well…” Kimber wrinkled her brow in thought. “I’ve always told you that you have to decide what you want your life to be and make it happen.

 Deke shook his head. “Kitten, I think he meant me.”  
  
  When she glanced at him for confirmation, Jesse sent her a half grin. “Yeah, man to man. Or something like that.”  
  
  His answer clearly surprised her. “Oh. Sure.”  
  
  While it was no secret that Deke had never been a fan of his, and Jesse really had no right to ask for even a word from the man, he was thankful Kimber’s hulk of a husband seemed willing to give it.  
  
  “Sit.” He waited until Jesse complied. “I get it. Good times and fast women are easy to come by and hard to turn down.” Deke sat back and took Kimber’s hand. Though the overhead lights cast a glow on his golden hair, no one would ever mistake him for an angel. “But you’ve got to stop acting your age in rock star years.”  
  
  “Rock star years?” Jesse frowned. What the hell was he talking about?  
  
  “Cut your age in half and add one.” Deke cracked a smile.  
  
  Jesse shook his head. “I’m not fifteen.”  
  
  “Then don’t act like it. Life isn’t about getting high or laid. Obviously, you’ve got an incredible career. It’s your character everyone is questioning. Stop behaving like a douche. Start being a man. It’s not complicated.”  
  
  Well, he’d asked for it, and Deke had never been one to candy coat.  
  
  “I’ve been sober for a year. Actually, almost thirteen months.”  
  
  “That’s great!” Kimber praised.  
  
  The other man simply cocked his head and leveled him with a hard glance. “Women?”  
  
  Jesse didn’t want to answer with Kimber in the room. His wandering penis had only been one of the reasons she’d left him. He hated to admit how little he’d changed since their breakup. “I’m no saint.”  
  
  “Hmm,” Deke mused. “Last bed partner?”  
  
  He hesitated. “A couple of cities ago.”  
  
  “You remember her name?”  
  
  “No.” Jesse grimaced.  
  
  “So she didn’t mean anything to you?” Deke quizzed.  
  
  “Nothing.”  
  
  “Then why did you do her?”  
  
  She’d been eager and pretty and willing and… “I don’t know. I didn’t have a reason not to.”  
  
  “If you want your life to have meaning, you have to treat all the parts of your life as if they’re meaningful.”  
  
  Deke’s advice surprised Jesse. His words had almost sounded philosophical. Kimber’s husband had always struck him as being long on intimidation and short on principles. Clearly, Jesse hadn’t looked past the brawn.  
  
  His former fiancée wore a scowl. “Deke’s right. When was the last time you wrote music? And recorded it? That used to mean everything to you.”  
  
  He sucked in a breath and winced. “Longer than I’d like to admit.”  
  
  “Your new album doesn’t sound like you. It’s great. Catchy and fun. Edgy. Clever.” Kimber flushed. “That came out wrong. I know you can be fun and clever and all that. It’s just…some of your best hits were soulful ballads about finding yourself and following your heart. You wrote those before you hit it big, and I haven’t heard a song like that from you in forever.”  
  
  She was right. Between the two of them, Jesse heard the message loud and clear that he’d lost his way, personally and professionally. This sabbatical away from the limelight had to be about becoming a whole new him. He couldn’t wait. Getting the opportunity to change his partying, sex-god image—and himself—couldn’t come soon enough.  
  
  “You’re right. And I needed the honesty.” Jesse stood. “Let me know when you have that baby. Thanks.”  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  Texarkana, Texas  
  
  “How have you not committed double murder?”  
  
  Bristol Reese stared into her beer, then glanced at her best friend. “They’re not worth twenty-five to life. But don’t think it hasn’t crossed my mind.”  
  
  Jayla scowled, her dark, expressive eyes both disapproving and dismissive. “Girl, that’s restraint. He’s a player and she’s batty as hell.”  
  
  “Which is why they deserve one another. I’m sure they’ll have a short, miserable life together,” she shot back, then chugged some of her brew, ignoring the clapping and laughter from the group gathered at the large table in the center of the restaurant.  
  
  Her friend’s expression softened, her mocha skin glowing under the muted amber lights above the bar. “What about you? You gave that man sixteen months of your life. I really thought he intended to propose to you.”  
  
  “I did, too. But I guess Hayden decided that Presleigh is better wife material.”  
  
  Jayla snorted. “No, he thought having Miss Lafayette County on his arm would make him look like the shit with his buddies. That beauty pageant skank might look good in Victoria’s Secret, but she’s not you.”  
  
  Bristol nodded. “Actually, I think that’s something Hayden appreciates about her. And she’s not a skank. It pains me to admit it, but she’s sometimes sweet.”  
  
  “She stole your man!”  
  
  “I don’t think she had to try very hard,” Bristol pointed out. “Hayden was dazzled by her short skirts and her adoration…and that was that.”  
  
  Jayla pulled what she would have called her stank face. “His bitch ass needs to be taught a lesson.”  
  
  Her friend was probably right, but Bristol had to take part of the blame. Her pride stung when she realized she’d buried her head in the sand and ignored her instincts about Hayden because she’d wanted him to be everything he wasn’t—sweet, helpful, caring, capable of compromise. God, why was she so idealistic? A sweeping, romantic gesture bowled her heart over every time. She wanted Mr. Darcy to move heaven and earth to marry her, sought an Edward Lewis who was willing to conquer his fear of heights to rescue her so she could rescue him right back, hoped for her own Johnny Castle to tell her parents that nobody puts Bristol in a corner, ached for an Edward Cullen who knew his soul well enough to take one look at her and realize she was “The One.”  
  
  She was a hopeless romantic, and it hadn’t brought her a damn thing but misery.  
  
  “I’m not sure he’s worth the effort.” Bristol sighed.  
  
  “And Presleigh has no spine.” Jayla was getting indignant on her behalf, slamming a fist on the bar.  
  
  “Another fact Hayden appreciates, I’m sure. I wouldn’t conform enough for him. He always tried to change the way I dress, and all but bullied me to shut down my ‘silly’ business. He would have much preferred that I teach Sunday school at the church, maybe sell some Mary Kay on the side, and be blissfully happy to be Mrs. Hayden Vincent the third.”  
  
  Jayla looked disgusted. “That’s not you. You’re too passionate about life to do nothing but keep a clean house, spit-polish up the kids for Christmas photos, and scrapbook your life away.”  
  
  “Agreed.” She drank more of her beer, then lowered the mug to the nearly empty bar with a sigh. “But you basically described Presleigh. Hell, maybe they are a perfect match.”  
  
  “Ugh. He’s falling for an empty package.”  
  
  Bristol shrugged. “But he doesn’t have much depth, either. I let myself be dazzled by a few roses and charming words from the most eligible guy in town. I mean, he’s Lewisville, Arkansas’s version of a Kennedy. I had a crush on him in high school something fierce. And he looked good in his football pants.”  
  
  Jayla tilted her head. “I’ll give you that.”  
  
  “I appreciate you being mad on my behalf, but honestly…I’m more humiliated than heartbroken. I’m over him.”  
  
  For the foreseeable future, no more entanglements of the heart. Flings only. If she kept the length of her relationships to a night—a weekend, tops—she couldn’t make the same mistake again.  
  
  Bristol simply wished she didn’t have to see Hayden and Presleigh together all the damn time. But in a town of twelve hundred people, avoiding them wouldn’t be easy. Even if she moved away, she’d come home to visit and run into them eventually.  
  
  “A toast,” Corey, one of Hayden’s football friends from high school said, standing in front of the rest of the gathering. “Raise your glasses  
, everyone. To Presleigh, the most beautiful girl in Lafayette County. May you always follow your heart and be happy. To Hayden… Cheers, man. You’re one lucky bastard.”  
  
  As the crowd laughed, Bristol looked on with a sigh…then spotted her mother bustling over, her Pepto-Bismol pink suit looking more suited to Easter Sunday services than an engagement party.  
  
  “You’re being rude,” her mother chastised. “This is Presleigh’s event, and you’re sitting at the bar, sulking. Come give her your love and support. After all, she is your sister.”  
  
  Bristol tightened her grip on her mug. “I closed my restaurant early and drove forty-five minutes down the road to celebrate her upcoming nuptials to the man who dumped me for her. I think the fact that I’m here at all is enough.”  
  
  “You sound bitter,” her mother tsked, her hair not blowing at all as the air conditioner kicked on.  
  
  She wasn’t. She and Hayden hadn’t been a good match, and she hadn’t wanted to admit it. In truth, he’d done her a favor by falling for someone else. Bristol just wished that someone hadn’t been her younger sister. At nineteen, Presleigh was too young to get married and too pampered to know what the word compromise meant.  
  
  “Mama, leave it. Please. I’m not making waves. I’m still speaking to her. And to him. Anything more will take time.”  
  
  Her mother frowned. “At least come sit with the group. Food will be served soon, and the rest of the family is asking questions.”  
  
  Because keeping up appearances with her Aunt Jean, a distant cousin, and the rest of the townsfolk was far more important than any potential heartbreak or misery her own daughter may have suffered.  
  
  Beside her, Jayla rolled her eyes. She and Linda Mae Reese had never gotten along. Her best friend had always sworn that her mother favored Presleigh. Bristol had never experienced that as vividly as she was right now.  
  
  “We’ll be there in a few minutes, Mama. I’m just waiting for a friend.” Maybe the others would be done eating before she had to admit that her “friend” hadn’t shown up—what a shame—and she joined the party as it wound down for the evening.  
  
  “Who?” Her mother frowned. “We didn’t invite anyone else, Bristol.”  
  
  In her mom’s vernacular, that meant that Bristol asking someone new to join the party without her knowledge bordered on unacceptable.  
  
  Jayla gave Linda Mae a sweet-as-pie smile. “Her new boyfriend.”  
  
  Bristol whirled on her barstool. “Are you crazy?”  
  
  What the hell was she going to do when no new man showed up except look more pathetic?  
  
  Her pal gave her an apologetic grimace. “It slipped out.”  
  
  Quickly, Bristol scanned the few men nearby to see if any might be suitable fake boyfriend material. Maybe she could bribe him with a few drinks to play nice for an hour. But no guy fit the bill. Predictably, most folks in a restaurant near the five p.m. mark were at least old enough to be social security eligible or were married with children.  
  
  “Oh.” Her mother reared back, obviously surprised. “I didn’t know you were seeing someone. Who is he? Where did you meet? What does he do? Where does he live?”  
  
  The more her mother asked questions, the more suspicious she sounded—with good reason. It wasn’t as if Lewisville had a huge pool of eligible bachelors, and Bristol didn’t make the trip west to Texarkana often.  
  
  She shot Jayla a glare. Her friend shrugged in silent apology. She appreciated Jayla wanting to prevent her mother from continuing the bitter-hag routine, but this lie simply didn’t help.  
  
  “Mama…” Bristol sighed, knowing she needed to swallow a choking bite of humble pie and admit that she was totally single. But damn, she wished she didn’t have to.  
  
  Behind her, she heard a shuffle and turned to see an absolutely gorgeous guy emerge from the shadows. His tight black tank framed an amazing set of muscled shoulders, one of which was covered by a tribal tattoo. He had a strong jaw, wore a black skullcap and a pair of expensive-looking sunglasses, along with a smile that made her breath catch.  
  
  When he removed the shades to stare at her, his dark eyes danced with amusement. “Hi, honey. Sorry I’m late.”  
  
  \* \* \* \*  
  
  Jesse knew he should have resisted butting in, but the cute little brunette had clearly been through hell with her sister and the ex-asshat. Her mother’s haranguing only seemed to make her sink down on her barstool more, as if she wanted to escape. He knew what it was like to have shit coming at him from all directions. That lesson felt particularly fresh now.  
  
  He had sneaked a peek at the entertainment news on his smart phone when he’d wandered into town a few hours ago…and wished he hadn’t. If he could go back in time and stop Ryan from tragically ending two lives, he’d be eternally grateful. Sadly, a miracle wasn’t in the cards for him, but he kind of hoped the girl at the bar saw him as one. She wasn’t crying in her beer yet, but if he couldn’t give her some breathing room soon, she absolutely might.  
  
  When he spoke, her green eyes, tucked under the sun-kissed fringe of her bangs, bounced from the bar, up to his face. She blinked, stared. Jesse worried that covering his shorn hair, shaving the scruff, removing his earrings, and not wearing leather wouldn’t be enough to disguise him. He knew damn well he’d taken a big, impulsive risk by showing himself in public—but who could resist a dive called Bubba Oink’s Bone Yard?—and jumping in to Bristol’s situation. Thankfully, he didn’t see recognition on her face, merely confusion.  
  
  “I’m not too late, am I?” he prompted.  
  
  She swallowed, and her pretty African-American friend discreetly nudged her ribs with an elbow. The brunette slid off the stool. “Ah…no. We haven’t eaten yet.”  
  
  “What’s your name, young man? My daughter hasn’t mentioned you.” Her mother, who had a serious case of helmet hair, sent him a frown somewhere between puzzled and disapproving.  
  
  He stuck out a hand and improvised. “My name is James, ma’am. Most of my friends call me Jamie. Nice to meet you.”  
  
  Her mother took his hand. Her soft skin felt cold. “James. I’m Linda Mae.”  
  
  “I’m Jayla,” Bristol’s friend added with a friendly handshake. “So glad I finally get to meet you.”  
  
  “Pleasure.” He nodded at the women, then took the pretty brunette’s hand in his. “It’s good to see you, Bristol.”  
  
  Surprise widened her eyes even more. He liked the way she wore her emotions on her face, the way freckles dusted her nose, the way her pouty lower lip shimmered under the lights.  
  
  “Um…you, too, Jamie.” She sent him a stilted smile.  
  
  Linda Mae shook her head suspiciously, then huffed back to the others.  
  
  “We should join the party,” her friend suggested and grabbed her by the elbow, hauling her toward the gathering. She gazed past Bristol to him with a wink. “Thanks for joining us.”  
  
  He grinned back and followed. “You’re welcome.”  
  
  The long table around which everyone else sat looked fairly cramped, and Jesse didn’t think Bristol wanted to get cozy with these folks anyway. So he pulled up seats at the empty table directly behind it. He placed Bristol between him and her friend, then looped a casual arm around the back of her chair, brushing her long ponytail as he did. He’d enjoy his knight-in-shining-armor routine for an evening, then he and Bristol could have an amicable “breakup” before he continued down the road in search of somewhere to spend the next couple of weeks. But for tonight, she’d have a reason to thumb her nose at her mother and sister.  
  
  On the far side of the party’s table, a blonde wearing too much makeup and a gaudy engagement ring made googly eyes at a twerp with light brown hair and a condescending expression. Bristol had dated him?  
  
  The rest of the party sent him glances ranging from curious to suspicious. He waved. “Hi, everyone. I’m Jamie, Bristol’s new boyfriend.”  
  
  After a brief round of introductions, he settled back into his chair and watched his supposed new squeeze. She was built on the petite side, but he’d already noticed when she rose from her barstool that her jeans hugged the curves of her really pert ass. The pretty little thing also had a noteworthy rack.

I don't want my dick to touch anything that another dick has touched, I ain't into that gay shit. So basically, before I sleep with a chick, I make sure she's never been with another dude.

My process is very thorough. First I check her socials to make sure she hasn't had any boyfriends. If she has, it's an immediate pass because you know she's a slut. If she passes, then I take her to a gynecologist (I know a guy) to make sure her pussy is tight. I also visually inspect her pussy, because as we all know if she's got beef curtains, she ain't a virgin (the more guys she's fucked, the longer and darker they get.)

After that, if she's clean, I fuck her once, and I'm done. I don't kiss her or let her give me a handjob, because even if she's a ""virgin"" she might still have blown or jerked off dudes. I also wear a condom and drink my cum afterwards, just to make sure she doesn't steal my seed, plus it's a good source of protein.

The problem is, I've slept with over 300 virgins in my area, and there's no way there's any more. I could wait around for high school chicks to get old enough, but I can't go that long without sex. I want to move (again, all my income is passive) but I don't know any areas with a high virgin ratio. Maybe if someone made an app that could track when chicks get fucked the first time (if anyone knows one, hmu) but it seems like it's just gonna be random chance.

The other problem is there are way too many chicks who get pissed when I ask if they're a virgin. I don't use dating apps, because only sluts who are cruising for cock use those, so I'm really just relying on going to coffee shops, bookstores and other lame ass places. I've also trained myself to build up an immunity to mace, and am now unaffected by it, so I just laugh when some whore tries to spray me. I've also beaten every restraining order and ""harassment"" charge (my lawyer is a G) so there's that too.

Maybe one day scientists can invent a surgery or something that can restore a chicks virginity, because all I want in life is a forever virgin tradwife who will always have a tight innie pussy, who can take care of my children, cook and clean, and always be available for sex 24/7.

This feels like a straight up lie or a safety issue if true.

I work at a restaurant next to a Dutch Bros location and we occasionally will trade food for coffees with them. It was my first time doing it for the team and when I went online and the app to find the nearby store’s number, I couldn’t. All google locations had the same number, which I quickly learned is the corporate one. I call and because I’ve worked in the food service industry and wasn’t born yesterday, I ask for the number to the nearby store for order questions. The customer service/corporate person tells me that they don’t have numbers online because the locations don’t have phones at them. The reason she gave for this was so the workers can better help the guests at the store. 

I am in no way saying that I deserve the workers at my nearby store’s attention more than any other customer, nor is it a worker or other customer’s fault. I do however want to say that I’m not dumb. I know that place probably has a phone in it because 99% of places do no matter what type of work place they are. And to add to my evidence, other than common sense, the store next to where I work has called us from the store about trades before. It is fully possible it was a workers personal number but if there really aren’t phones at the locations, wouldn’t that be a safety risk?

I guess I’m more wondering if anyone else has had an experience like this or has any insight. Mostly curious and frustrated.",0,1756605519.0,dutchbros,14,0.5,False

Had a good conversation and she took my number down ( I found out they were a trio of sisters that share the same phone #). I thought them sharing the same number was odd but they texted me and we had another conversation over the phone. It ended with them inviting me to visit Sacred Grove ( I live about 15 minutes away from there). I got a tour of Joseph Smiths old home and got to walk through the forest. It was cool to learn about the gold plates and see where it all started.

 Then they invited me to visit Hill Cumorah which I got to see the remodel of the new visitors center and walk up the hill to see the statue. Which was also cool. 

They have invited me to church more then once but I have explained that I have just started attending a community church and I want to give that a fair chance before I move on to other options. But they keep asking me to attend and asked me if I want to meet for a 4th time. I guess I just want to know if I should keep entertaining or wondering if they are just trying to recruit me. ( I was raised a Jehovah’s Witness and left so I am really doing research first before getting involved in a religion with such similarities)

Some of my doubts include:

-The validity of the gold plates if there were only 11 witnesses.( Could Joseph have just made the plates up and just wrote his own book?)
-Is it really necessary to avoid tea and coffee? I guess I can understand alcohol, but coffee and tea?
-You have to full tithe in order to enter the temple
-Joseph Smiths many wives and he seems to be the center of the religion instead of Jesus 
-The introduction of the book of Mormon says, ""the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the Keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, then by any other book"" ......So do they view the Bible as second to the Book of Mormon?

  SABELLE RION HEARD DEATH whisper, felt its breath on the back of her neck. Bram, it called. Come with me. She clutched her brother’s hand, trying desperately to keep him anchored in this mortal plain.  
  
  Since becoming a fully transitioned witch at twenty-four, she’d had the ability to touch others and make them feel whatever she wished. In the last sixty years, she’d perfected the skill. Very few were immune to her gift. But she had no idea if Bram could feel the positive healing vibrations she now sent his way. If so, they weren’t improving his condition.  
  
  Damn the black smoke surrounding her brother, slowly smothering his life and, she worried, his magic. And damn Mathias for attacking Bram with it! Fighting back angry tears, she clenched her fists, her fingernails cutting into her palms.  
  
  Just yesterday, they’d tangled with the evil wizard who had escaped after hundreds of years of exile. Last night, Conrad the healer and her aunt Millie had examined Bram. Neither knew what the deadly smoke was, exactly what damage it caused … or how to eradicate it.  
  
  They only knew it was draining the life of the person she loved most in this world.  
  
  “Can I come in?”  
  
  Sabelle looked over her shoulder as Lucan, her brother’s best friend, entered the room. Following Mathias’s abduction of his mate, Anka, and the breaking of their bond, Sabelle had cared for Lucan, providing him vital energy through sex while he’d been incoherent and suffering acute mate mourning. Bram had given him support, protection, and a roof over his head. It was no surprise that Lucan wanted to help care for Bram in return.  
  
  “Certainly. ”  
  
  “Any change?” He caressed her shoulder.  
  
  The gesture surprised Sabelle. Lucan had never touched her while bound to his former mate. But now that Anka was in the arms of another, and he knew Sabelle had recently provided the sexual energy needed to keep him alive, had that changed their friendship in his eyes?  
  
  Nibbling on her lip, she risked a glance in Lucan’s direction. He was a beautiful man. Coffee-colored hair brushed wide shoulders. His shocking blue eyes lured a woman from between a thick fringe of black lashes. His mouth … He knew how to kiss; she’d learned that … eventually. over time, he’d become less frenzied in his mate mourning and pressed his mouth to hers. The skill of it had stunned her. Someday, they would both need a mate. Becoming Lucan’s would solve many problems . . .  
  
  She shook her head to clear the thought. His gesture meant nothing, was merely one of comfort. Lucan still had strong feelings for Anka. And it was impossible for Sabelle to think about her future when her beloved brother might soon pass to his nextlife.  
  
  “No change,” Sabelle murmured.  
  
  Clutching her shoulders, Lucan urged her to her feet to face him. “Come eat. You’re worrying yourself to exhaustion. ”  
  
  She pulled away. “I can’t leave Bram. What if he wakes and needs me?”  
  
  “Spare yourself five minutes. olivia and Sydney have been cooking—the human way. It’s taken them hours to prepare enough food. They did it for you. ”  
  
  The tears that had been threatening all day speared the back of her eyes, closed up her throat. Though she’d only known the other women for a few weeks, she already considered them great friends. Yes, circumstance had thrown them together. Having Mathias on the loose required a magical army to defeat him. Bram had assembled the Doomsday Brethren, a group of warriors, mostly magical, willing to fight. olivia and Sydney were mates to two of Bram’s fighting force, and had not only stood by their men, but the group. They’d risked themselves to rid magickind of this cancer, though the fight wasn’t theirs. Their efforts to help her touched Sabelle.  
  
  “Five minutes,” she agreed reluctantly.  
  
  Lucan nodded and brought her close. “I’m worried about you. You can’t carry all of Bram’s responsibilities on your shoulders. ”  
  
  She cast him a desperate gaze. “I have to try. He’s worked so hard to build this—”  
  
  “No one will allow it to crumble. Come see. Everyone is assembled downstairs, waiting for you. ”  
  
  Everyone? Surely not … “Shock?”  
  
  Lucan clenched his jaw. “No one wants the traitor here. ”  
  
  Especially not the traitor who was now shagging Lucan’s former mate.  
  
  It touched her that the Doomsday Brethren had come to pay homage, but she feared only one person could help her brother. “Has anyone searched for Bram’s mysterious mate? Emma’s energy—”  
  
  “Might heal him. I know. But it’s hard to find a woman when you know nothing more than her first name. Sydney has volunteered to call Aquarius, since she presumably knows Emma. ”  
  
  Sabelle shook her head. “Aquarius says she doesn’t know Emma’s whereabouts. Her flat is empty, her mobile phone disconnected. The shop she once worked in is closed tight. Bram already tried all those avenues. Clearly, the woman doesn’t want to be found. ”  
  
  “In light of the situation, Sydney agreed to speak to Aquarius once more. ”  
  
  She prayed the woman would help them this time. If not … The looming possibility stabbed despair through her heart. Sa-belle beat back a fresh batch of tears. She would not cry. Waste of time that solved nothing. She could fall apart later. Alone. Now, too much was at stake.  
  
  Lucan smoothed a thumb across her cheek. “You’re one of the bravest women I know, Bella. Bram is my best friend. Let me help you. Lean on me. ”  
  
  The offer was tempting. Lucan was a strong wizard and warrior. But he’d lost his mate a mere month ago, and had only just learned that Anka sought refuge with an enemy. His whole life had been torn apart. He needed to get back on his own feet before worrying about her issues.  
  
  She plastered a smile on her face. “I’m fine, but thank you. ”  
  
  “Let me help. There wasn’t time earlier for me to express . . . ” He sighed. “Thank you. I know the sacrifice you made to save me, the risk you took in bedding someone feral to provide me proper energy to live and heal. ” Lucan threaded his hand thorough her pale hair. “I remember being with you. Your fear. Your determination. Your softness. ”  
  
  He remembered? Damn and blast. That would complicate everything. But it wasn’t as if she’d forgotten the feel of Lucan either, his heat, his hardness, his single-minded intent. The unexpected desire. In their time together, Sabelle had come to know him as a lover … and she wasn’t certain how she felt about it. Now was hardly the time to sort it out.  
  
  “Lucan, I—”  
  
  He brushed his lips over hers, cutting off her words. Soft but firm. Achingly gentle. He set his mouth on hers and merely felt her. Breathed her. Then he lifted his head.  
  
  “Anything you need, I will be here for you. ”  
  
  Why? Friendship? Gratitude? Passion?  
  
  Though she often tried to block others’ thoughts, she peeked into Lucan’s. Friendship, certainly, and gratitude by the bucketload, a bare hint of passion—and a welter of confusion. She related to that.  
  
  Slipping from his mind, she sent him a wan smile. “Lead the way. ”  
  
  Lucan took her hand and led her downstairs to the dining room. As he’d said, everyone was assembled. Marrok stood, tall and daunting as ever. olivia, his mate, sat beside him as he rested a big hand on the crown of her dark head. Envy tore through Sabelle. She ached for the sort of love and affection they shared. Between her brother’s protective streak and her obligation to marry well, she wondered if she’d ever find it.  
  
  “Are you all right?” Sydney asked gently.  
  
  The human redhead stood beside her wizard mate, Caden. Lucan and Caden exchanged a brotherly glance that she didn’t have the energy to decipher.  
  
  “Fine,” Sabelle reassured her. “Something smells good.  
Thank you for cooking. ”  
  
  “Come eat so you can get back to Bram. ” Sydney shoved a plate into her hands and gestured her toward the spread of food on the sideboard. Roasted hen, a flaky white fish, even a Beef Wellington, along with an array of vegetables and breads. The gesture touched her all over again, pricking her eyes with tears.  
  
  “Thank you so much. ” Sabelle sniffed and blinked, holding back the tears.  
  
  “Eat. ” Lucan pushed her toward the food, then accepted a plate from Sydney and stood protectively behind Sabelle.  
  
  She dished herself a few spoonfuls of food without looking at what she’d served herself. It was all just nutrients to help her tend Bram longer. Nothing else mattered.  
  
  Behind her, all the others plated up. Sabelle settled into her usual chair. Lucan sat directly to her left. Marrok and olivia settled in at the far end of the table. Caden and Sydney plopped down beside Lucan. The Doomsday Brethren’s newest member, Tynan o’Shea, sat glumly across from Marrok and began picking at his food. His vengeful thoughts blared past her mental barricades, along with his pain. His grief over his intended mate’s murder by Mathias was affecting his appetite. Sabelle had no trouble understanding why.  
  
  Beside her, Bram’s chair at the head of the table sat empty. The realization that he might never again sit there hit her like a blow to the belly. She lowered her fork and looked at her plate, now blurred through her tears.  
  
  “Sabelle. ” Simon Northam, the Duke of Hurstgrove, approached the table slowly.  
  
  Until the formation of the Doomsday Brethren, Bram and Duke hadn’t known each other well, but despite his lofty human rank, he’d been a solid member of the group from day one.  
  
  She took a moment to swallow her tears, then raised her gaze. Being born a Rion, everyone expected her to lead by example, tamp down her fear, and move on. Bram, most of all, would demand it. For her brother, she’d stay strong.  
  
  “I’m fine. ”  
  
  Duke nodded, dark hair looking uncommonly shaggy, as he set his plate on the table and eased himself into Bram’s chair. She swallowed an urge to jump up and rail at him. He could not take her brother’s place!  
  
  “Would you rather sit here, or shall I?” he asked softly.  
  
  The angry wind left her sails. She took a deep breath, common sense prevailing. The group needed a leader, and Duke occupying Bram’s chair signaled he was willing to take the job.  
  
  “You. I’m no warrior, and I’ll have my hands full with Bram’s Council business. ”  
  
  He cast her a sympathetic gaze, a silent promise of support, then looked down the table. This was for the best. Mathias was weakened, but in no way defeated. The Doomsday Brethren had to stay together and remain strong.  
  
  Duke opened his mouth to speak when the last of the warriors sat down—directly across from her.  
  
  Ice.  
  
  Sabelle felt that intense green gaze of his fasten on her. Oh God.  
  
  Though fearsome and reportedly insane, since becoming a member of the Doomsday Brethren Ice had been on his best behavior—around her, anyway. Hardworking. Polite. Even-tempered … mostly. But the constant staring and the naked want on his face tied her belly in knots. He was a puzzle she was utterly compelled to solve.  
  
  His fierce expression made her wonder exactly what he was thinking. oddly, he was one of the few people whose mind she could not read. She’d tried. Nothing. Wondering what was in his head drove her mad. The one time Ice had put his arms around her to heal Sydney’s injured friend, Aquarius, had been overwhelming. Combustive.  
  
  Forbidden.  
  
  Not only born to the Privileged class of magickind, she was among its elite, the closest thing to royalty in the magical world. Rions were descendants of Merlin, the greatest wizard of all time. While Ice … well, the Rykards were not only Deprived, but disliked and distrusted—Ice more than most. As if that didn’t complicate their attraction enough, Bram hated him with a boundless passion.  
  
  Anything between her and Ice was impossible.  
  
  “Is something wrong?” Lucan asked, wrapping his warm fingers around her chilled ones.  
  
  Ice’s fork clattered to his plate, his mouth tight. She didn’t need to read his mind to feel his hostility. It raged across his face as he stared at her hand clasped in Lucan’s. Her breath caught, and her first instinct was to pull away. She checked it. Nothing good could come of fostering an attraction between her and a man she could never have. Better to let him believe her attentions were otherwise engaged.  
  
  She gripped Lucan’s hand in return, feeling his strength and fortitude.  
  
  “I’m fine. ” Sabelle realized with a start that the entire table was staring, and she flushed. “Truly. Everyone eat. ”  
  
  Silence reigned for long moments. No one spoke, and the dead air was painful. often, Bram led the conversation—or dominated it, as was his wont. The quiet now only reminded her that her brother might not live long enough to control the conversation again.  
  
  Suddenly, Duke cleared his throat and addressed the group. “No one can replace Bram, but someone must oversee our leadership while he recovers. Does anyone else want the role?”  
  
  Marrok shook his head. “I know not magickind’s people or how to help them in their time of need. I possess not Bram’s diplomacy. Those who impede our cause would feel only the hack of my blade, if I had my way. 

Which is why you’re a warrior, not a politician. ” olivia, his American mate, smiled.  
  
  Their affection, as always, wrapped them in a world all their own.  
  
  “I will, if you wish it,” Caden volunteered. “Though I think you have more experience to handle the difficult times ahead. ”  
  
  Though gratified by Caden’s show of solidarity, Sabelle agreed.  
  
  “I formed the group with Bram,” Lucan offered, then swallowed. “But my mourning has just ended. My temper is … uncertain. ”  
  
  Lucan spoke the truth. His emotions scraped closer to the surface than she’d ever seen. He revealed much with his gestures and expressions—too much to handle magical diplomacy now.  
  
  “I’ve been with this group less than a week,” Tynan pointed out, his gray eyes the color of a foreboding rain cloud about to burst.  
  
  A fitting metaphor, Sabelle mused. Tynan himself was a ticking time bomb.  
  
  Everyone had spoken … except Ice.  
  
  Drawing in a shaky breath, Sabelle braced herself to look in his direction. He was still staring at her, hot, intent. Something in her belly tightened again. Was she actually shaking?  
  
  “Who is wont to listen to a madman?” Ice challenged with a raised brow.  
  
  Duke cleared his throat. “Then it’s settled. We must resume fighting and weapons training again. Marrok?”  
  
  “Aye. Tomorrow at dawn. Everyone. ”  
  
  Caden rolled his eyes. “oh-dark-hundred again. Great. I left the Marines, you know. ”  
  
  “Foolish on your part. They were nicer,” Duke teased, then sobered again. “We’ll need to add security to the house. I’ve no notion how Bram’s magical defenses are holding up in his weakened state. ”  
  
  “Not well,” Sabelle admitted. She could feel it slipping by the hour … just as Bram was.  
  
  “After dinner, we’ll develop a new network of magical security. This house is critical to our success. We need a place to meet, to regroup, to plan. Without it, I fear we’d be too disorganized to defeat Mathias. Does anyone disagree?”  
  
  Every man at the table shook his head.  
  
  Good. Another matter settled. Now if she only knew what to do about her brother’s diminishing health . . .  
  
  “. . . give us an update?” Duke asked.  
  
  It took her a moment to tune in to him, and she surmised that he asked about Bram. If he wanted new information, she had dealt with nothing else all day.  
  
  “Bram is resting, but weakening. Neither Conrad nor Millie know what ails him or how to heal him. I’ve no notion how to stop it unless we find Emma. ”  
  
  “I’ve got a call in to Aquarius,” Sydney assured. “As soon as I hear from her, I’ll let you know. We’ll find Emma. ”  
  
  Even if they did, could they persuade her to come care for the mate she’d taken in a night of passion and abandoned before morning?  
  
  Silence overtook the group again, punctuated only by the clink of forks and heavy sighs. Sabelle blocked as many thoughts as she could and ate a few more bites of her dinner before admitting defeat. Even the smell of food was making her stomach roil.  
  
  She stood to leave, and Lucan stayed her with a hand at her elbow. Ice growled and glared at Lucan’s touch. Ice wanted her, and an answering knot of desire grew again in her belly. He must suspect how she felt. If she ever found herself alone with him … nothing would be more dangerous.  
  
  “You cannot be finished,” Lucan chided, scowling at her still-full plate.  
  
  “I am. ” She folded her napkin on the table. “I must get back to Bram. Thank you, ladies,” she said to Sydney and olivia.  
  
  Before she could extricate herself from Lucan’s grip and depart, bells chimed through the house. A magical calling card. A request to enter the premises.  
  
  From Anka MacTavish, Lucan’s former mate.  
  
  Beside her, Lucan tensed, his face a wrenching mixture of anger and yearning. Sabelle felt the intensity of his pain gripping her chest, sharp and panicky, like someone suffocating. No doubt, whatever Lucan felt for her paled in comparison to the consuming love he still harbored for Anka.  
  
  Marrok stomped out of the room and down the corridor. Sabelle heard him open the front door. “She is alone. ”  
  
  Assured that Shock or Mathias and his Anarki hadn’t followed Anka, Sabelle released the last bit of security around the house so that Anka could enter the room.  
  
  The first thing Sabelle noticed was that the woman looked healthier than before … but not completely well. Was Anka not gathering enough energy in Shock’s bed?  
  
  Lucan’s gaze was still glued to his former mate. Despair tinged his thoughts, and Sabelle ached for him. She understood wanting someone beyond reach.  
  
  Anka glanced at Lucan, then at his hand upon Sabelle’s. Hurt flared across her face before her amber stare skittered across the table and rested on Duke. “I’d like to see Bram. ”  
  
  Duke hesitated, cast a quick gaze at Lucan, who gave a small shake of his head.  
  
  “He’s not here,” Duke lied.  
  
  So, they’d surmised that because Anka was sleeping with a wizard they all presumed to be the enemy, she couldn’t be trusted? The witch’s thoughts revealed that, in throwing her lot in with Shock, she had run to the man most able to protect her and least likely to make demands after her ordeal at Mathias’s hands.  
  
  Anka tossed fat, blond ringlets off her slender shoulders, her broken magical signature still matching Lucan’s, indicating their severed mate bond.  
  
  “He doesn’t seem to be anywhere,” Anka said, clearly frustrated. “I’ve been calling for him since dusk. ”  
  
  “Council business. What do you need?” Duke snapped.  
  
  Anka pressed her lips together, sent Lucan another uncertain glance, then addressed Duke again. “Earlier this evening, Shock told me some alarming things. I—I couldn’t keep this to myself. Not when there are so many people here I … care for. ”  
  
  Duke gestured her to the chair at the far end of the table. Anka sat, as did Sabelle and Lucan. He didn’t relinquish his hold on Sabelle’s arm, and she knew Lucan needed the support. He might turn to her because she was convenient and would expect nothing in return—but his heart belonged to Anka.  
  
  “According to Shock, the Anarki plans to attack you here tonight, sometime before midnight. ”  
  
  It was currently just after eight.  
  
  Sabelle opened up her mind a bit more to Anka. The woman wasn’t lying, and she truly had been trying to tell Bram all evening. They’d been ignoring incoming messages and summons, uncertain how to handle them. Bugger!  
  
  Duke froze. “You’re certain? Tonight?”  
  
  She nodded. “I warned you as soon as I could. ”  
  
  “Why should we believe you?” Ice asked impassively.  
  
  Her amber eyes burned. “I’m risking my life to be here. ”  
  
  Given Anka’s fierce expression, Sabelle didn’t doubt her in the least—and she admired the other woman for her grit. But there was something Sabelle didn’t understand.  
  
  “Why are you fucking the enemy if he works for the monster who raped you?” Lucan snarled. “Especially if you’re stabbing him in the back?”  
  
  “Clearly, you haven’t been alone, either,” she shot back with a fiery glare. Hurt blasted from Anka’s every thought before she folded her hands on the table in front of her and collected herself. “You don’t understand what Mathias did to me. ”  
  
  “I know what he did. ” Regret tinged Lucan’s tone. “I’m more sorry than you’ll ever know that I wasn’t there to protect you. ”  
  
  “What Mathias did changed me. I—I can’t remember all of our mating, can’t just resume life as the happy mate. I cannot pretend I’m not damaged—”  
  
  “The past doesn’t matter. Nothing he did changes you in my eyes,” Lucan vowed. “What you’re doing with Shock—”  
  
  “You’re expecting me to be the same woman I was before I was taken. I’m not. I can’t undo that fact, even for you. ”  
  
  “You think I can’t handl  
e it? or you no longer trust me to protect you?”  
  
  Anka bit her lip. “I can’t discuss this now. ”  
  
  “Soon. ” Lucan stood so suddenly, his chair toppled over, clattered to the floor. Then he left, slamming the door in his wake.  
  
  Anka sprang up to chase him … then thought better of it. But the way Anka watched Lucan’s retreating back, her thoughts riddled with both sadness and indecision, made Sabelle’s heart wrench.  
  
  Duke cleared his throat. “I’m sorry. Go on. ”  
  
  Anka looked ready to cry. “I’m sorry to cause problems. ”  
  
  “Not at all. What else can you tell me about the attack? How many? Where around the estate? What do they seek to accomplish?”  
  
  “A large force. Shock didn’t say how many. I don’t know how they plan to get in. Maybe Shock knows a way . . . ” She sobbed.  
  
  Clearly, seeing her former lover while turning on her new one wasn’t easy.  
  
  Like Lucan, Sabelle had wondered why Anka remained with Shock. Now she understood that between his low station and low expectations, she found him “easy” to be with during this difficult time.  
  
  “They want the Doomsday Diary,” Anka murmured.  
  
  Sabelle squeezed her eyes shut. Damn Morganna le Fay for creating a weapon that wizards had been willing to fight and die for since its rediscovery less than two months ago. Fifteen hundred years in hiding had swelled the book’s legend so much that people would do anything to get their hands on it.  
  
  “Mathias can’t use it,” Sabelle pointed out. “And he knows it. He’s not female. ”  
  
  Anka nodded. “They plan to take one of the females from this house. ”  
  
  “He will not take her. ”  
  
  Sabelle turned toward the booming declaration. Ice. His protective gaze was as tangible as a caress. She swallowed.  
  
  “Of course not,” Duke assured. “Sabelle is too important to our cause. ”  
  
  Ice stormed around the table until he hovered beside her, mere inches away, his body heat pouring over her. “If there is a breath left in my body, he will not take her. ”  
  
  Duke turned to her with a silent question, but Sabelle ignored him. Ice’s protective nature was similar to a mate’s. Naturally, Duke would be curious about anything between her and Ice. A mating between them would be nothing short of shocking.  
  
  Ice was long rumored to be mad. Many whispered that he possessed a murderous temper. Sabelle didn’t know why exactly, and she hadn’t seen Ice behave erratically, but Bram had gone to great pains to keep distance between her and the warrior he saw as a necessary evil. Servants avoided him, refused to meet his challenging gaze that silently laughed at their fears. But when he looked at her, his stare held another sort of challenge altogether.  
  
  Sabelle stared anxiously at Duke’s face, praying he and the others would ascribe Ice’s possessive behavior to his alleged insanity. Whatever his motive, she couldn’t accept anything Ice might offer … no matter how much everything inside her wanted to.  
  
  “I’ll be all right,” she whispered to Ice, daring to glance at him over her shoulder.  
  
  Still, he lingered beside her, so close she swore she could hear his heartbeat, smell his body, a musky blend of sage, cedar, and raw earth. That scent weakened her knees every time.  
  
  “Thank you, Anka,” Sabelle said. “We’ll take care to protect the house and the book. ”  
  
  “There’s more,” Anka said, then turned to Duke again. “Shock said that Mathias has decided the quickest way to ascend to power is to win a seat on the Council. ”  
  
  That made Sabelle’s heart stop. “There are no open Council seats, haven’t been for decades. ”  
  
  Anka’s thoughts assailed her, and the devious truth made Sabelle gasp. She turned to look at Duke, who suddenly wore a grave expression.  
  
  “He’s going to assassinate a Council member?” Sabelle’s voice trembled.  
  
  “The plan is to start with one. But eventually . . . ”  
  
  Mathias plotted to kill them all. How else would he gain complete control of the Council? That meant if he hadn’t already targeted her brother, Bram was now on his hit list.  
  
  Her knees wobbled. Her stomach revolted. The stunning revelations came one after the other … and she melted toward the ground.  
  
  Before she came anywhere near the floor, she felt strong hands beneath her, assisting her to her feet, then lifting her into iron-band arms. Sabelle looked at her rescuer, but already knew she’d find a bare stubble of black hair and vivid green eyes penetrating her all the way to her soul.  
  
  Gently, he set her in her chair. “You’re overdoing. Enough. ”  
  
  Clearly, her efforts weren’t enough if Bram wasn’t improving and Mathias was plotting to take down the Doomsday Brethren, steal the diary, and kill Council members. None of them had done enough.  
  
  “You’re certain?” she asked Anka, her voice weak.  
  
  Biting her lip, Lucan’s former mate nodded. “I ran to tell you. I know you have no reason to trust me. My association with Shock in no way transfers to Mathias. After what he did to me, I hope he burns in hell, and I’ll do whatever I can to help, even pass information.

1n4iq78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1n4iq78/was_i_being_unreasonable_for_requesting_an/,Was I being unreasonable for requesting an apology and then walking away from an entire church community ?,"I (26M) met this guy (lets call him Lucas - an evangelical christian) last year in April at the library. We hit it off right away. We opened up quickly about life, struggles, goals, and I eventually met many of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like we were building a solid, meaningful friendship.

Over time, though, I noticed how rigid and argumentative he could be. Conversations often felt like debates (even when they didn’t need to be) and he always had to be right. Still, I supported him a lot. I gave him relationship advice, career tips, and tried to be there when he needed someone. I honestly thought the support went both ways.

We got into a conversation about politics. He told me he was a DJT supporter and asked about my views, and I said I leaned Democrat. His response was, “That’s probably just because of your dad.” I explained that while my upbringing influenced me, my beliefs are still my own. He laughed and said, “How much?” I told him I didn’t want to quantify it, but he insisted, saying, “I’m going to assume a lot then” and then started trying to convince me that I actually agree with him more than I realize. It didn’t feel like a respectful conversation (it felt like he was trying to invalidate my stance and manipulate the direction of the discussion).

The next day, I texted him and said I didn’t appreciate the way he dismissed my views and made assumptions about me. I said an apology would suffice, not in a confrontational way, just to express that I felt disrespected.

He said he doesn’t like texting and preferred to talk in person. When we met up, I bought him a coffee at Starbucks and we sat down on a sofa and the whole thing exploded. He said I was trying to bring him down to my level, accused me of having low self-esteem, called me controlling and untrustworthy, sounded like the devil and said I “love conflict"" and even said I was bullying him at a given moment. It felt like he was unloading a bunch of resentment and going straight for personal attacks. I was stunned. I reminded him how much I’d supported him in the past (not to guilt him, just to show that I’ve always acted in good faith). He accused me of being manipulative and trying to make him feel bad for me.

He ended the conversation by saying, “This friendship is over,” and insisted on doing a prayer with me and I declined respectfully saying it wasn't about that. He got up and told me to hug him which I also declined but extended my hand to shake and he shook it then walked away.

Afterward, I sent him one last message and blocked him:

“I don’t feel bad about myself, Lucas, nor do I have low self-esteem. I’m okay the way I am—even better than some people, to be honest.What really bothered me was how you turned a simple request into a character assassination.People make mistakes, including you—you even joke about them sometimes. But today you took things to a different level, throwing insults at me non-stop.I don’t deserve that kind of treatment. I’m not interested in being friends after this. Ciao for now.”

It's been 7 months of no contact but absolutely no one has sided with me out of the entire church I use to go to (I stopped going for 7 months now). For some reason his close friend keeps reaching out every 2-3 months and it seems performative or like he's trying to collect info and report back to Lucas.",3,1756605415.0,Christianity,5,1.0,False

I'm looking to get some cupping gear and would love some recommendations for cupping spoons and cups that are not only functional but also have a visually appealing or stylish design.

I know classics like Rhino, Acme, and Loveramics are widely used, but I’m also open to more unique, artisan, or aesthetic options, even if they’re a bit unconventional. I'm especially drawn to:

- Matte black or gold finishes for spoons.

- Cups with minimalist, ceramic, glass, or handmade vibes.

- Sets that look cohesive and clean with all my coffeeware.

- Options available in or shippable to Mexico, if possible.

Any favorites you’ve tried and loved? Or any brands/stores I should check out? Bonus points if the gear is built to last!

Thanks in advance 🙏",4,1756605320.0,pourover,1,1.0,False
1n4iozk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1n4iozk/suicide_note_a_story_by_teresa_mummert_free_read/,Suicide Note: A Story by Teresa Mummert Free Read online," I typed on my computer, tucked away in my cubical, invisible to the world around me. People stopped in periodically asking for favors, never once asking how I was or if I had plans for my birthday next week. If they had, I would have lied and told them I had a party out of town. In reality, I planned on spending the evening on the kissing bridge, finally finishing the last few chapters of the novel that had replaced any semblance of a social life. I lived vicariously through those characters. It was safer than opening up to real people who inevitably would hurt me or let me down. Where I went from there was still up in the air.  
  
  I planned on marrying on that bridge, overlooking the beautiful blue sparkling water below. Those plans began to take on life when I became engaged just three months ago. I spent two years of my life with Thomas. He woke me every morning with a kiss when I first moved in with him and even brought me breakfast in bed on occasion. As time went on, those kisses were replaced with an apology for whatever he may have said or done the night before while under the influence of his favorite whiskey after a late business meeting. Eventually, he stopped coming home.  
  
  I knew the stress of his job weighed heavily on him, and I tried my best to ignore the warning signs that everything was falling apart around us. That was until I found a pair of lace panties shoved under the pillow of our bed and I realized it was impossible to keep a relationship afloat when one of you was hell-bent on destroying it. I smiled sadly to myself as the overwhelming feeling of betrayal swept through my body. Holding my breath, I slowly began to count down from twenty as I released the air that filled my lungs.  
  
  Instead of planning my wedding, I watched as my older sister, Gail, planned her dream wedding. I wrapped my long brown hair into a bun and slipped my pencil through it to hold it in place before I clicked print. I hurried toward the printer on the other side of the office hoping to complete my work so I wouldn’t be stuck in the office until after the sun set.  
  
  “Woah, Jenn. Slow down there. ” Howard gave me a toothy grin before sipping his mug of coffee. His light brown hair, in desperate need of a trimming, was slicked back in a greasy mass. His eyes danced over my chest, causing me to cross my arms over my breasts. The way he looked at me made me feel sleazy and cheap no matter how many articles of clothing I had on.  
  
  “I have work to do. ” I shuffled nervously from foot to foot, glancing over Howard’s shoulder to the copy machine.  
  
  “Of course you do. Speaking of which, I need the Douglas report by Tuesday. I know that’s not much time but—”  
  
  I held up my hand, stopping him from finishing his sentence. I didn’t argue about having to work through the weekend. It was a sad fact that I never had anything going on in my private life. I welcomed the distraction.  
  
  “Oh, no,” I whispered in a panic as Jake Philips, the office manager, grabbed a stack of papers from the printer. I shoved by Howard and made my way to the machine. It sat empty.  
  
  “Just get it to me sometime Tuesday,” Howard called after me, raising his mug as he spoke before taking a sip and glancing around the office. His eyes fell on the new intern that started last week, and he grinned as he made his way to her desk.  
  
  “Damn. ” Rubbing my hands over my face, I searched out Jake, who was reclining comfortably in his office chair behind his oversized mahogany desk. His dark, short hair brushed across the top of his forehead as he flipped through the stack of papers in his hand, his expression unchanging. I let my eyes linger on him for a moment. I never understood why he was so mean to me. He constantly barked orders and barely glanced in my direction while doing so. Over the last week it had only gotten worse, and I wondered how much more unkindness I could take from him before I finally snapped and quit my job. My goal was to be a partner in their advertising firm, but that dream seemed to slip further away with each passing dirty look from Jake or unsolicited come-on by Howard.  
  
  Maybe it didn’t print, I thought, as I made my way back to my desk.  
  
  I pulled out the Douglas file as my fingers shook. My blue eyes danced over the typed print as I struggled to focus on what I was reading. I glanced back at Jake, who was busy filing papers, completely oblivious to the inner turmoil I was experiencing in my small, claustrophobic cubical. Feeling another panic attack begin deep in the pit of my stomach, I concentrated on the task at hand, hoping to keep it at bay.  
  
  As I began typing, visions of my sister’s upcoming wedding on the bridge flooded my thoughts. I wondered if my family would make a fuss about me not showing. They most likely wouldn’t even notice that the maid of honor did not arrive. It didn’t matter. I wouldn’t be there. I had to stand up for myself, even if no one else would.  
  
  “Jenn, pop this in a mailbox when you go for your lunch. ” Jake held out an envelope addressed to APO.  
  
  “Yes, sir. ” Taking the envelope from his hands, I slipped it inside my blazer pocket. I typed a few more lines before pushing my chair back from my desk and made my way quickly to the elevator, hoping to avoid Howard.  
  
  “Jenn,” Jake called after me, causing me to freeze in my tracks as I rubbed my clammy palms on my skirt. “Nonfat milk!”  
  
  I nodded my head but didn’t respond as I quickly slipped inside the elevator.  
  
  “That suits you,” Gretchen whispered form my left.  
  
  “I’m sorry?”  
  
  “Your dress, dear. The yellow makes your blue eyes glow. Very pretty. ” Gretchen smiled, the lines of her face crinkling as she brushed back her silver curls from her face.  
  
  “Thank you. It was on sale. ” I ran my hands over my A-line dress. It was a far cry from my normal attire of jeans and a T-shirt, but I needed to look professional at work if I ever wanted to move up in my career.  
  
  Gretchen nodded as the doors opened on the ground floor, and I hurried out to make my way down the street to the local coffee shop. I wrapped my arms around my waist to counter the chilly breeze, silently cursing myself for not grabbing the blazer that hung on the back of my chair.  
  
  SSgt. Shane Tudor  
  
  Kuwait, March 5, 2010, Friday  
  
  “How can you sleep?” Pvt. Ryan Owens kicked the side of the worn-out mattress that I slept on, my arm thrown over my face.  
  
  “Kick me again and I’ll make you count, pretty boy. ” I moved my arm and grinned at Owens before placing it back over my face to block the light from incoming helicopters. Owens ran his hands over his dusty blond hair as he laughed.  
  
  “You’re gonna pull rank, man? That’s not cool, Tudor. ” Owens plopped down on the edge of the dilapidated mattress and removed his boot blousers that kept his pants from hanging over his boots.  
  
  “Get off my bed, O. ” Months of deployment coupled with my home life falling apart had left me bitter and mad at the entire world. War had been a distraction, but now I was being thrown back into the real world.  
  
  “I can’t wait to get home, man. Beth is practically throwing a parade in my honor. ” Owens slipped off one of his boots with a groan.  
  
  “Good for you. Get off my bed. ”  
  
  Ryan ran his hands over his face, coating in them in the fine sand that clung to everything in this place.  
  
  “Once she sees you, she’s gonna change her mind. ” Ryan tossed his boots into the corner and grinned in a way we rarely did around this place.  
  
  Narrowing my dull blue eyes in warning, I pushed myself up into a sitting position. I ran my hand over my freshly clipped, dark brown hair and hung my head, stretching the achy muscles in my neck.  
  
  “Chelsea made her choice,” I replied angrily as I stood up and pushed open the flap of the tent.  
  
  “He’s a dentist. What the hell would she want with  
a dentist?” Ryan slipped off his other sock and replaced it with a freshly laundered one, sliding his foot back inside his boot.  
  
  “Dentists don’t deploy,” I groaned as I gripped the metal framing of the tent over my head and stretched my back.  
  
  “She’s a whore, man. ”  
  
  I glared back at Ryan, who held his hands up, knowing he went too far.  
  
  “All I’m saying is make your leave count. Two weeks of as much local ass you can get your hands on. You won’t even remember her name by the time you touch sand again. Shit, maybe you will come back and be just a little nicer than the enemy. That would be a nice change. ” Ryan patted me on the back as he slid passed me and out into the hot dry air.  
  
  Instead of coming home to smiles and cheers, I will step off the plane to pity and sad eyes, if anyone was there to greet me at all. I was supposed to be getting married on leave at the church just off post where Chelsea and I met. Instead, I sat lonely and worried in a desert in Iraq while some other man comforted my fiancé. She ran off and married him in the very church that we had picked out for our nuptials just seven weeks ago. I had no desire to leave my men behind while I worried what kind of danger they were in to go home to the turmoil that waited for me there. I’d given up hope and to be honest, never really thought I would make it back.  
  
  “Flight coming in three hours. I was assured our guys would be on this one. ” Rodgers called out of the sound of the helicopter engines.  
  
  “We’ll see. ” Our flight had already been kicked back three times. Not that I was complaining. It was nice to be able to sleep for a few days without the sounds of mortars in the background.  
  
  I walked back inside the tent and flopped down on the thin mattress, letting my boots hang over the edge. I had just enough time to catch some sleep before making the grueling flights home. I closed my eyes and instantly became assaulted with flashbacks from only weeks prior.  
  
  January 15, 2010, Friday – Baghdad, Iraq  
  
  “Get him off the pool table, man!” Owens was panicked, pulling off his soft cap and wiping the mixture of sand and sweat from his brow.  
  
  “Where the fuck do you want us to put him?” I had never seen so much blood up close. I had seen the remnants of human bodies after a suicide bomber, but never had I watched someone’s life literally drain out of them. The green felt was overcome by the thick, sticky blood and my memories flashed to Christmas last year when I was with Chelsea, asking her to marry me.  
  
  “Get out of the way!” Chancler, the medic, yelled, wiping the sweat from his face as he pushed through the group of soldiers that had gathered round the table. “Don’t move your hands, Tudor. ”  
  
  “It’s still coming out, man. I can’t squeeze his leg any tighter. ”  
  
  The Iraqi Army soldier lay peacefully on the table surrounded by pool balls. “He’s too quiet!” I tried desperately to keep my voice level for the benefit of the soldiers around me while this man’s life literally slipped through my hands. His body went slack. Chancler rubbed over his stubbled jaw with bloody fingers and hung his head.  
  
  “He’s done. The shrapnel severed his femoral artery. He didn’t have a chance. ”  
  
  I kept my fingers over the oozing wound as I glanced around the room at all the young, weathered men who stared back at me. I had no words, no idea what to say to make the situation any different from what it was. This was our reality. At any given moment, everything could be taken from us.  
  
  “Come on, man. ” Owens pulled on my shoulders and I stumbled, not wanting to release my grip on the leg. “Let’s hit that new shower trailer before lunch. ”  
  
  I looked down at my hands as crimson liquid dripped from the tips of my fingers, landing on my camel-colored boots that already had a fresh dusting of sand as fine as baby powder clinging to them.  
  
  “I’m gonna need new boots. ” I could feel the shock taking over me as all rational thought escaped me.  
  
  Owens patted me on the back as he pulled me out of the block building and into the blinding sun of Baghdad.  
  
  “We’ll call your girl after you get cleaned up. She can order some and have them shipped to you. ”  
  
  I startled awake and glanced down at my feet that still hung over the edge of the bed. The tips stained black from that life-changing day seven weeks prior. Not only had I witnessed my first up-close-and-personal death that I still blame myself for, but that was the day I discovered Chelsea was no longer waiting for me at home. In fact, she hadn’t been waiting for some time. Can you hear me?” I plugged my other ear with my finger as I yelled into the receiver.  
  
  “I hear you!” Chelsea whispered back.  
  
  “Were you sleeping?”  
  
  Chelsea rubbed her face and glanced past the man lying next to her to her alarm clock. It read 1:00 a. m.  
  
  “No,” she sighed as she carefully peeled back the comforter and slipped out of the bed. She ran her fingers through her tangled, blonde mane as she traipsed into the kitchen and turned on the light over the sink.  
  
  “I can tell when you lying. ”  
  
  Chelsea smiled weakly as she grabbed a glass from the cabinet and turned on the water, waiting for it to get cold.  
  
  “How’s your sister?” I leaned my forehead against the plywood wall.  
  
  “The doctors are optimistic. Everything all right?” she asked as she filled her glass and took a long gulp, suddenly parched.  
  
  “Just a long day. We patrolled for a few hours. You wouldn’t believe the heat. ” I lied. I wanted to talk about anything but the incident with the Iraqi soldier. I needed to be reminded what I was fighting for.  
  
  “Shane, it’s late,” she sighed, as she set her glass down on the counter.  
  
  “I know. I needed to hear you voice. ” My eyes closed, picturing her smile.  
  
  “What are you doing up?” a man’s voice called in the background.  
  
  “Who was that, Chels?” My eyes shot open. Every worry I had from the day suddenly seemed miniscule to what was going through my mind now.  
  
  “We need to talk, Shane. ”  
  
  “Don’t fucking do this to me. Not today. ”  
  
  “I sent you a letter. ”  
  
  “I didn’t get your damn letter. ” I squeezed my eyes shut, begging the tears to stay at bay while I was around other soldiers.  
  
  “This is just too hard, Shane. I can’t take the worrying. ”  
  
  “You? You can’t take the worry? I wake up every morning not knowing if I’ll be alive by bedtime. ”  
  
  “Don’t do that. That’s not fair. ”  
  
  “Fair?” I laughed and slammed the phone down on its base.  
  
  I grabbed my rucksack and slid it over my shoulder and picked up my duffle bag. Sleep was overrated. I made my way to the defac in hopes of getting a quick bite before we needed to make our way to the plane.  
  
  “Hey! I got you a tuna. At least I think its tuna. ” Owens slid over on his seat, making room for me.  
  
  “Doesn’t matter at this point,” I groaned, as I dropped my bag and adjusted the weapon that was slung across my chest.  
  
  “I hear ya. I hope my girl can cook. ” Owens took a big bite of his sandwich and food oozed out of the corners of his mouth. The soldier across the table glared at him.  
  
  I shook my head. I knew Owens would come back from leave brokenhearted when his pen pal turned out to be a man or married.  
  
  “What, fobbit? Not used to seeing a real-life soldier? You want an autograph from a real American hero?” Owens joked as he wiped the food from his mouth.  
  
  “You can write it right here. ” The soldier grabbed his crotch as his buddies laughed.  
  
  “I guess he only wants my initials,” Owens replied, looking at me. I just hung my head and laughed.  
  
  “King of battle my ass,” the man replied with a sneer as he got up from the table, his two friends flanking him followed suit.  
  
  “I think you hurt their feelings. ” I shoved the last bit of my food into my mouth. “You know we are all on the same side. ”  
  
  “Screw him. Let’s go enjoy our R and R. ”  
  
  We stood and grabbed our bags before catching a ride to the airstrip on the other side of the base.  
  
  “I almost forgot. I grabbed our mail. ” Owens held out several envelopes for me. I took a deep breath before grabbing the letters from his hand and slipping them into my pocket.  
  
  “Thanks. ”

  I slid a bagel into the toaster as my eyes glazed over reading my report for work. We needed to make it look like the company was pulling in more money from their ads than it was losing, but numbers didn’t lie. That was the reason I loved math. It was the only pure form of honesty left in this world.  
  
  My food popped up and I held the papers as I made her way to the fridge to grab the cream cheese, tossing it on the counter. My phone rang and I answered it, cradling it between my shoulder and ear as I attempted to spread cream cheese on my bagel.  
  
  “You are impossible to get ahold of!”  
  
  “It’s too early for you to be so damn chipper. ” I rolled my eyes as the phone slipped from my shoulder and onto the counter. “Shoot! Sorry, I dropped my phone. ”  
  
  “No worries. Listen, I have some news. Are you sitting down?”  
  
  “Sure. ” I rolled my eyes and adjusted my weight to my other foot and set the butter knife down to give my sister my undivided attention.  
  
  “I’m getting married!” she screamed, causing me to pull the phone from my face.  
  
  “How can you get married? You’re not even dating anyone. Not unless you count that homeless guy who likes to rub against you on the bus. ” I rolled my eyes as I picked up half of my bagel and took a bite, glancing at my finger that used to hold my engagement ring.  
  
  “That was one time and I no longer take public transportation. This is serious. Don’t get mad. ”  
  
  “Gail, you can’t tell someone not to get mad. Just spill it. I’m not making any promises. ”  
  
  There was a long pause and I pulled the phone from my ear to make sure the battery hadn’t died.  
  
  “I’m in love with Thomas Sullivan. ”  
  
  It wasn’t possible to die from a broken heart, but it felt like I was being crushed from the inside. My world imploded around me as his name replayed over and over in my head like a broken record.  
  
  “How?” My eyes brimmed with tears as I searched my memory for any moment that would lead me to believe there had been anything between the love of my life and my older sister.  
  
  “We’ve always liked each other, Jenn. He didn’t want to do wrong by you. He’s a good man. ”  
  
  “Do wrong?” My words were barely a whisper. “I found…oh, God. I’m going to be sick. ”  
  
  “I’m so sorry. You can’t fight true love. Besides, I thought you would be happy for me. You know it hasn’t been easy for me. ”  
  
  “I hate you!” I clamped my hand over my mouth as quiet sobs racked through my body and I sank to the kitchen floor.  
  
  “How could you say that? You’re so selfish!”  
  
  I clicked the button to end the call and threw my cell phone across the kitchen as my knees hit the linoleum with a painful thud. I began counting down from twenty but it was no use. My breaths came in short, sporadic inhales until I felt dizzy and my world began to spin. I had always lived in the shade of my sister’s shadow. I didn’t mind because it kept my parents off my back and allowed me to pursue the career I wanted while they nitpicked and fussed over Gail. Now that shadow was growing and looming over me like a storm cloud that was going to consume my entire existence.  
  
  I couldn’t fight the sadness that swirled in my chest, and I was too broken to try.  
  
  Shane  
  
  March 5, 2010, Friday  
  
  “You think any of these German hotties would like to feel my weapon?”  
  
  I smacked Owens on the back of the head and laughed.  
  
  “You got a girl waiting at home for you. ”  
  
  “Yeah, but she can’t moan in different languages. ”  
  
  “How do you moan in different languages? Doesn’t it all sound the same?”  
  
  “That’s what we need to find out. ”  
  
  “Looks like we’re gonna be here for a while. Unfortunately, this is the most you’re going to get to see of Germany. Soak it in, boys. ” Lt. Sage laughed as he pointed over to the USO.  
  
  “Travel the world they told us. ” O  
wens laughed as he pulled open the door to the USO tucked away inside the airport.  
  
  I followed him in through the door as I shook my head and made my way to the couch in front of the television on the left side of the room. I sat down and sighed as I pulled the letters from the inside of my ACU top.  
  
  One was from my cousin, Jake, who lived in Maine and the other was from Chelsea. I had been waiting for this letter to arrive for nearly two months. I slowly peeled it open and unfolded the letter that still smelled of her soap.  
  
  January 1, 2010  
  
  Dear Shane,  
  
  I spoke to you yesterday and you asked me what my New Year’s resolution was. I didn’t have the heart, or maybe the guts, to tell you over the phone, but I have decided to change my life. When you and I began dating two years ago, I had no idea who I was or who I wanted to be. I was fresh out of college and all I saw was you. You consumed me.  
  
  I want you to know that I don’t regret a single second of the time we spent together, however little that time was, but I can’t continue to live with my life on hold as I wait for you to return. Sometimes, I am not sure you will.  
  
  The only women I have here to talk to are from the Family Readiness Group. It’s nice to have others who understand what it is like to be with a soldier and treat me like one of the wives, even though we are not married yet and I can’t attend the meetings. But it’s a double-edged sword. One of the wives from alpha battery lost her husband three weeks ago.  
  
  I can’t wait for you to die, Shane. I jump every time someone knocks on the door, terrified that it will be soldiers coming to give condolences. She had three kids. Can you imagine? I couldn’t continue on and look at those poor kids in the eye, knowing I had chosen a husband who could have died at any minute.  
  
  I know you think I am selfish and I just don’t understand, but I do. It takes an incredibly strong woman to be a soldier’s wife. I’m not that strong. I love you, Shane. You deserve better.  
  
  Love Always,  
  
  Chelsea  
  
  I hadn’t talked to her since New Year’s, and Chelsea had never mentioned anything about wanting to leave me. I angrily shoved the letter back into the envelope and crumbled it in my fist before I let it tumble out of my hands to the floor below. I had tried with everything I had inside of me to be the man my aunt raised me to be. I tried to be strong but my heart had been shattered as a little boy when my mother died and I had never been able to find all of the pieces. I had given Chelsea half my heart and it wasn’t enough. I should have refused to reenlist. She begged me not to, but I was not ready to live in the real world, to be a normal citizen.  
  
  “That what I think it is?” Owens held two mugs of beer in his hands. I just nodded and stared off toward the television. “You’re better off. ”  
  
  I glared at Owens, who plopped down next to me on the vinyl couch and held out a beer.  
  
  “Think about it. ” Owens took a long sip from his beer and wiped the foam from his lip with his free hand. “Could you imagine finding out when you got home? I heard of a guy who came home for mid-tour leave and found his wife in bed with some stripper. ”  
  
  “Doesn’t sound so bad. ” I raised my eyebrow and took a drink, trying my best not to let the pain show, but Owens knew. He was my best friend and my battle buddy.  
  
  “A male stripper,” he laughed. “It could always be worse. ”  
  
  “All you do is sit around and gossip like a bunch of housewives. ”  
  
  “It’s true. Happened to a gun bunny from bravo. ”  
  
  I rolled my eyes and took another drink.  
  
  “What’s that one?” Owens eyed the unopened envelope in my lap.  
  
  “From my cousin. ”  
  
  “Is she hot?”  
  
  “He is married. ”

  I was startled at the sound of the doorbell. Slowly lifting my head, I peeled off the piece of paper that stuck to my cheek.  
  
  “Just a minute!” I called out as I jumped from my seat and tried quickly to organize the mess on my desk that sat in the corner of my cramped living room. The bell rang again and I took off down the hall, pulling the hair tie from my hair and fluffing my brown locks to make myself look more presentable.

The room had a grey ambience, almost like a foggy Greenhouse. It was different from most interrogation rooms, The light dangled from the ceiling like a spider from a web. Every second was counted, every sound was recorded. A dark, tinted window was engraved into the right side of the wall. People watched through it, taking notes as they listened carefully to what the witness had to say. Two men were sitting at the grey laminate table. One man donned a mustache with a suit and tie as well as hands full of files and classified documents. The man sitting right across from him had a terrified look on his face, avoiding eye contact while looking down at his fidgeting hands. “Lutenant Carter Rowel, you were aboard the U.S.S. Irvine On July the first, 2011 is that correct?” The Interrogator glanced at Lieutenant Rowel with darting eyes. “Yes sir, that is correct.” Rowel responded. “On the night of July the first, 2011 did you see an unidentified aircraft in your airspace?” The Interrogator asked to clarify Rowels extraordinary claim. “Yes sir, that is correct.” Rowel responded once again. “Can you describe this object you witnessed on the night of July the first?”

July 1st, 2011 - 7:08 AM (The account of Carter Rowel)

“My name is Lieutenant Carter Jacob Rowel. I am a Naval RD Currently aboard the U.S.S. Irvine off the coast of California. My board number is 6893. I am writing to report a series of strange radar signals I received earlier this morning. We tried restarting the Radar, but the signals didn't disappear. If anything they were more clear. I am reporting to make sure there are no unauthorized drones in the area that we are unaware of.  -Sincerely Jacob Rowel.” I sent this message to the Our Naval company director earlier this morning. It was my job to monitor and track any flying objects within our airspace. Every Naval fighter plane, ship, or military aircraft is marked on the radar as being one of ours. Each one of them has an aircraft number linked to a specific plane. When an Aircraft enters our airspace and is not marked as one of our own, then that Aircraft is considered an unknown. Usually we are able to get in contact with these aircrafts via radio. They often turn out to be a foreign plane that has headed off course, or an Aircraft that we forgot to mark as our own. But this time when I tried getting into contact with these Unknown Aircrafts. “34, 34, This is the U.S.S Irvine, do you copy-Over?” There was no response. The Radar showed three Plane sized objects 20 miles East of the ship. “34, 34, This is the U.S.S Irvine, do you copy-Over?” Once again, there was no response. I then notified the attorney general of this strange occurrence. “Sir, come look at this.” The attorney general walked over quickly. “What is it?” He asked intently. “Theres three unknown aircraft in our airspace. I tried radioing them, but I got no response.” The Attorney General looked at the static Radar. “Radio over one more time.” He ordered. “34, 34, This is the U.S.S Irvine, do you copy-Over?” Once again all I heard was white noise, with no further response. I once again glanced at the green flashing radar. I noticed that they had to be planes since they were traveling at over 500 mph. “That's weird, most planes in our airspace would have responded by now.” I noted. “Maybe their Radio is jacked up and they headed off course.” Said the attorney general. Things got even weirder once I looked back at the radar and checked the velocity panel. It appeared that the objects were descending from space, and then dropping down to sea level in a matter of seconds. I've been monitoring radars for 3 years, and I have never seen anything like this before.

August 16th, 2025 - 6:45 AM

	The Mustached Man took a careful sip of his hot coffee. The room was even more silent than the day before. The security guard opened the door for a new subject to be integrated, by the name of Lieutenant Joseph Jesmine. “Please take a seat.” The Mustached Man insisted. “Now, state your name and your occupation.” The room went silent for a moment. “My name is Lieutenant Joseph R. Jesmine. I Was a fighter pilot aboard the U.S.S. Irvine on July the first, 2011.” The Mustached man pushed his glasses back up onto his nose. “On July the first, 2011. You claimed that you almost came into contact with one of these Unknown Aircrafts, is this true?” The Lieutenant looked at the man as if he was reminiscing about what happened. “Yes sir, that is correct.” The Mustached man took a sip of his coffee once again. “How would you describe this aircraft Lieutenant?” The Lieutenant paused for a moment. “Sir, you're going to think I'm crazy.” He said quietly. “But I know damn well what I saw, and it wasn't a plane.”

July 1st, 2011 - 9:30 AM (The Account of Joseph Jesmine)

	I received a message from the Attorney General earlier this morning. The message read- ""Lieutenant Jesmine. We have received strange radar signals of unknown aircraft in our airspace. You have been given orders to fly up there and check out what's in our airspace. We tried to contact them with a radio signal, but we got no response. You will take off at 09:50 flat. And head East of the ship. - Attorney General Groves.” I looked at the time and realized I would have to get ready for take off soon. I had never done a mission like this before, so I didn't really know what to expect. Nevertheless I packed up my gear, and headed up onto the runway upstairs. I fly a Single manned F-18 fighter jet, along with my wingman Jordon; codenamed- “Rush Hour”. I see Jordon near his plane manually installing his new 360 wing camera. “Yo Jordon, We got orders to check out these planes that are near our airspace.” I yelled overhead. “What? Are they Russians?” Jordan asked jokingly. “I dont know, maybe it's some unmarked drones for all I know. We’re supposed to leave right now, so call for a takeoff spot.” I said as I began heading towards my jet. Once I got in my jet I began radioing over to air traffic control. “This is Raven, requesting for takeoff-Over?” I look over to see Aircraft Marshals taking their positions. “Copy that Raven you are free for a spot-Over?” I start up my low engine and begin moving to my spot down the runway. “This is air traffic control, you are clear for Takeoff.” I full-throttle my fuel as the Hook on the back of my plane detaches. I take off smoothly with a minor bump as I exit the runway. The skin on my face begins to pull back from the G-forces. As I gain altitude, I see Jordan's plane overhead. “Raven, this is Rush Hour; do you copy-Over?” I turn my radio on and respond. “Copy that Rush Hour, head 20 miles east.” As we align our planes, I keep my eye on the Radar; waiting until I have sight of the Aircrafts. 
After around 10 minutes of circling the area, I finally got a ping on my Radar. “This is Raven, I have something on my Radar-Over?” “Roger that Raven, what is it you see-Over?” I look back down on my radar. “I see three green dots, it looks like they're just sitting there-Over?” “How is that possible?” Jordan asked. “They must not be planes then-Over?” I look back at my Radar screen. Suddenly, The Dots dart off quickly away from my screen. “What the fuck?” I say aloud. “Rush Hour, This is Raven. I lost sight of them-Over?” “What the Hell do you mean you lost sight of them? You said they were just sitting there-Over?”I scan my eyes quickly across the radar, only to find nothing but an empty, black slate. “They were just sitting there a moment ago, and then they darted off my screen, I dont know what happened-Over?” 

“Maybe your Radars Malfunctioning-Over” Jordan suggested. “My radar couldn't have been broken, I did a radar check this morning.” I thought to myself. “But what other explanation do I have?” I thought that maybe The Radar wave was being slower because of the wave disruption coming from the ship. “It's probably a radio wave disruption-Over?” Suddenly, I hear a loud crack as my radar shuts off completely.  “Hey what the Fuck!?” I yell out of confusion. “Hey, my radio shut off and I can't get it back on-Over?” I get no response. “Rush Hour, this is Raven; do you copy-Over?” Once again, I get no response. Usually I would use my radar to look for Jordan, but since I can't turn it on I completely lost sight of him. “Rush Hour, this is Raven; do you copy-Over?” As I fly straight, a silver object abruptly zooms past my jet, almost colliding with one of my wings. “Wow, what the Hell?!” The almost mid air collision suddenly makes me tense, as my heart rate rises. “U.S.S Irvine, This is Raven; Something almost hit me-Over?” Once again, I get no response. All I hear is a magnitude of white noise coming from my headphones. I am completely lost without a radar signal, and I notice that I am running out of fuel fast. “U.S.S Irvine, This is Raven. My radar is broken, my wingman is missing, and I am running out of fuel fast. I need to get back and refuel ASAP-Over?” I continue to get no feedback from the Radio. As I listen for a response, I see something out of the corner of my eye. I look over to see a silver object moving in the opposite direction. It was farther away this time, so I was able to get a closer look at the thing. It looked like a flying piece of metal, with no visible propulsion. “It had to be some sort of drone.” I thought. I decided to circle back around to follow it. As it moved on a straight path, I followed closely behind, watching it with awe. All of a sudden, the object began to speed up profusely. I began turning my throttle to speed up along with it. “Im not letting you go this time!” I say aloud. The object continues to speed up, getting faster and faster by the second. I pull the throttle all the way back and try to keep up with its acceleration, but it's just too fast. “Come on! Come!” I feel the G-Forces pressing on my chest as I go as fast as my body can handle. But it's just not fast enough. The object accelerates into super sonic speed as I begin to feel the blood rush to the back of my brain. My vision begins to go dark, as I begin to go unconscious. But then suddenly, it all stops. My body begins to feel perfectly still. As I opened my eyes, I realized that  the jet had stopped moving. I was suspended in the air, as if time had frozen. I then look up over the head of my cockpit, and I see it. The Silver Object, Just floating over my window. It was as if the object was keeping my plane suspended in the air with some sort of Unknown force. I looked at the object closer than ever. It was a large silver prism like shape, no larger than my Jet. As I looked at it longer, I noticed that it shined a bright green color; almost too bright to look at. I will never forget that shine. That Green Neon shine, brighter than the sun. 

August 16th, 2025 - 6:50 AM

“It had a green shine you said?” asked the Mustached Man. “Yes. sir” The Lieutenant responded. The Mustached Man began to take notes on a clippboarded piece of paper. “And what happened to your Wingmate?” He asked. “No one ever heard from him since that day, I still dont know what happened to him. There was a search mission sent out to recover his aircraft, but they found nothing.” Explained the Lieutenant. “Now about the aircraft, Are you sure this wasn't some sort of drone?” The Mustached Man asked. “Sir, I know what a drone looks like. They either have wings, a propeller; or some sort of propulsion. This thing had nothing. It was a static object, just floating there. An object with no windows, no labels; just a shape, A floating shape of unknown origin. And whatever it was, it wanted to be left alone.”

1n4ig1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1n4ig1f/the_disassembling_every_day_i_wake_up_im_missing/,"The Disassembling: Every day I wake up, I’m missing a limb","The TV flickers for the last time tonight as I flick the off switch. The thought of work in the morning sticks like a blood thirsty leach draining the wonder out of my body. I can only hope I get enough sleep, unlike most nights. Most nights I am always thinking in bed, and can never get myself to shut down completely, it’s as if my mind was forcing itself to stay awake. I often feel lonely most nights. I think about the friends I’ve made before I grew up and was forced to live the American dream. Even the fear of going to school can’t beat the dread of a 9 to 5.

Day 1

I woke up around 6 pm. At this time half my brain is still shut off, trying it’s hardest to gain back the sleep it’s been missing. My legs are weak, and they feel weaker this early in the morning. Once I force myself into my car, I am more or less prepared for the grueling day that is to come. A quarter of my foot is pressed on the gas while the other is resting near the side door. I hunch forward as if my back wasn’t strong enough to hold myself up. Once I get to work, I choose not to socialize. I see my coworkers as annoying crickets who can’t help but rub their wings together to chirp. Sometimes I regret not speaking, but the thought of judgment swarms my mind. I feel as if I know what others are thinking of when they think about me. They see this pale, introverted human being that's only personality is his job. Although they may be right about that. I am so focused on what others think I dont even realize I haven't even started my article I was supposed to write. As I lift my frail hand to take a sip of my coffee, my index finger starts to buckle. I feel a rush of fatigue run through my tendons. A sharp pain then follows as I spill my coffee all over my printed rough draft. “Shit!” In an act of frustration, I crumble the coffee soaked sheet of paper and dig it into the waste bin. As I drive home that night, I begin to think about how I could have spilled that coffee. It was as if I had forgotten how to move my fingers. I thought nothing of it, as one does when they feel a sharp pain in their chest that lasts only 3 seconds, but later cannot explain what it was. 

Day 2

I woke up earlier this time. Last night after a few hours of nonstop tossing and turning, I decided I would just wait this night out. The bags under my eyes are more prominent than they were the morning before. Each day feels like an instant replay of the same day, as if whoever controls this show “which is my life” loves to rewind to the worst part. Today felt shorter in the office. I never rewrote my rough draft, and I knew what was coming when I first walked in. The light was flashing on my office telephone. I knew almost instantly that it was a message from my boss. “Beep!...Mr Smith, This is genny. I am leaving a message on behalf of Mr Waldo, I am sorry to say that you have been relieved of your position at Nation Reports. You have until 12:30 pm to gather your stuff and we wish you luck…Beep!” I felt tense hearing that message. I knew what was coming but hearing it in real time really got to me. As I packed up my things, I felt a slight sigh of relief. “Maybe I can get a new job that's less life consuming than this one” I thought to myself. “My life could change for the better.” I use my back to lean out the front door since my arms are full of boxes and personal items. Driving home that day I felt another weird tingle on my left wrist, this time it was on the opposite hand of the one I spilled my coffee with the other day. Except this one felt different. Instead of a feeling of fatigue and weakness, it was more of a spasm. 




Suddenly I felt a thick tightening around my tendons as my wrist forced itself back with a swift jerk. I had no control over it, like something was pulling the tendons back. The pain was unbearable, like a constant stinging. Finally the tightening stopped. I was once again able to move my hand freely. “What the fuck was that?” I muttered. While I was still in the car, I decided to reroute my path to my doctor's office. I wanted to know what the hell was wrong with my hands. I pulled into the doctors office and waited for my name to be called. “Mr Smith?” I walked to the doctors office with an awkward gait. I didn't move my arms when I walked, in fear of my hands doing that weird spasm thing again. “The doctor will see you shortly.” The nurse said softly. Waiting in that room, I was wondering if any other patients have had what I had. I would feel less alone if this was the case. “Hello Mr Smith!"" The doctor exclaimed with an almost forced grin. “How are we feeling today?” I readjusted in my seat. “Never been better.” I replied sarcastically. 



“Well that's great to hear. What can I help you with today?” I looked the doctor straight in the eyes. “This past week, both my hands have been spasming uncontrollably. I was wondering if you know what is going on.” The doctor looks at me as he sits down in the chair next to mine. “From what I've heard you must be having muscle spasms due to lack of potassium. “But it's more than just spasms.” I added. “It's like my muscles are contracting, specifically my finger tendons.” The doctor tilted his head in curiosity, as he gazed at me. “Maybe I can prescribe you some sort of medication that should help with the spasming.” I nodded my head. “That sounds great.” I say with an almost relieved tone. After I check out my medication, I begin my drive home. An old Opera song plays on the radio as I drive down the dimly lit freeway. As I drive, I begin to think about my job. I wonder how long I'm gonna stay unemployed, or when I should start looking for another one. Maybe I should have gone to college and gotten some sort of degree. Then finding a job would've been too easy. I get home and immediately lay on the couch. I lay there for a while as I stare at the popcorn ceiling in my apartment. I'm no longer afraid to move my arm since I haven't felt that pulling sensation since before the doctors office. I slowly bring myself to my feet and walk to the kitchen. Since the living room was dark, I squinted my eyes as I walked into the brightly lit room. I see my pills sitting in a pharmacy bag next to the sink. “I guess I'm doing this.” I think to myself, grabbing the handles of the plastic bag. I pull the container out of the plastic and begin to unscrew the childproof lid. I pull a single red pill out of the container. I quickly swallow the pill as I stick my mouth in the sink stream to wash it down. “Hopefully this pill works.” I do my nightly routine like usual. Set my alarm, climb into my unimaid bed, and close my eyes until my brain shuts down. 

Day 3

	I open my eyes to a brightly lit room. I hear the average sound of cars honking outside my window. I look at the alarm next to my bed, I realize it didn't go off. “Shit, I must have overslept.”
I use my elbows to lift myself up against the bedframe. I suddenly realize my elbows feel lighter than usual. I then try to move my fingers but…”wait, where are my fingers?” I try to move any joint below my wrists but I can't feel a thing. In a moment of panic I quickly kick the sheets off of my bed and look at my hands. Or at least where my hands would have been. “What the fuck!?” I scramble off the side of my bed hitting my head on my nightstand as I fall on to the carpet. I continue to scream as thousands of thoughts squirm through my head. “Help! Help me!” I curl up into the corner of my room, staring at the two pointless nubs that remain. The skin at the tip was smooth, as if it had been healing for months. “What is this!? Why?! I begin to express a sudden mix of emotions. Fear, sadness, anger, and the feeling of complete helplessness. I sob viciously while curled up in the corner of the room. I start to sob so hard I begin to choke and gasp for air. My thoughts went into overdrive, I was clueless of what happened last night. I began to curse the doctor for giving me that medication, “but it couldn't have been the medication.” I think to myself as I stare at my handless wrists. After around 5 hours of being curled up in that corner, I finally stopped screaming. “Oh what do I do? What should I do?” I say aloud, as I start to think about what I am going to do with my life, now that I have lost the ability of being able to use my hands. I finally brought myself to my feet after 30 minutes of thinking. I was in a constant state of  horror the rest of the day. All the sobbing and screaming had worn me out, and I began to lay back down on the cold carpet. As my vision begins to fade, I start to feel a tingling sensation just below my ankles. I begin to feel numb on the floor, and for the first time in hours, I begin to smile. Not a smile of happiness, but a smile of agony. 

Day 4

My tear stained eyes begin to open slowly. As I wake, my mind quickly reminds itself of the reality I was in. Before I look at my hands, I close my eyes and pray that what happened yesterday was a dream. I pray that it wasn't real. But as I open my eyes, I still see my wrists as pointless digits, with no greater purpose. I begin to shed tears once again as terror finds me. As I lay there helplessly on the ground, I begin to realize I can no longer feel my feet. I quickly sit up and stare at the new horrors that have come upon me. “My f-f-f-feet?” “Where are my feet?!” I then begin to scream louder than I had the day before. I scream, shake, and cry for help. “Why are you doing this?!” I scream fiercely. ” All I wanted in this cruel world was a life, a purpose, a meaning! I wanted something to be given to me, not taken!” “Oh God why?!” After around 45 minutes I begin to crawl to my bed. As I stand up on my shins, I try to pull myself up onto the bed. I try multiple times, but I always seem to fall off. I pound my forearms on my bed in frustration. “Please!” I say with a trembling voice. After one more push I finally manage to pull myself onto the bed. As I lay on my cold damp bed, I feel as if I'm useless. Just a Handless, footless freak. I then began to stare out my window next to my bed. I spend a while just looking out the window, in an effort to calm myself down. I look at the cloudy sky, the ashy pavement right outside my apartment, and I feel the light breeze that leaks into my room through the cracks in my window. I begin to think about the peaceful landscape, as I drift into a deep state of thought. The peacefulness suddenly ends once I feel a tingling sensation around my eyes. I then realize this is the last time I'll be able to see such a beautiful sight, or anything at all. 

Day 16 

I have remained conscious for 12 days straight without rest. The last time I was able to  see was on Day 5. My eyes are now covered in a thick layer of skin, as if I were born without them. My upper and lower jaw have fused together covering where my mouth used to be. I no longer have arms or legs, My body is a smooth square with no appendages except for my head and my neck. I lack all senses except for touch, and thought. I began to wish I was dead days ago, but I am unable to harm myself. All I can do is wait until my body finally succumbs to starvation. My greatest wish at this moment is that it will all be over soon.

1n4ifr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1n4ifr7/30_day_water_fast_helped_me_with_alcoholism_and/,30 day water fast helped me with alcoholism and heartbreak,"Writing this as I slurp down the most delicious bowl of miso in my life. It's just a tablespoon of paste diluted in water. In fact, I had to put it aside because I felt full by the half of it.

So I had a really, really stinky summer, m'kay. Up until August, when I thought ""hell, why not just skip eating this entire month? Might help now that I feel I got nothing to lose"".

I'm not going to go into details since, but some of the biggest psychological traumas (that's a very, very bold and misused word now that I look back on it, NOTHING was the end of the world for me as it turned out thanks to clarity of mind that fasting gave me!) included drinking problems, my ex gf abandoning me after 6 years together and a major career disappointment.

None of it bothers me at this point and the last thing I'd want now is a beer. Time heals, fasting accelerates.

I had some experience of long fasting before. I've been eating OMAD (yeah, despite being a heavy drinker. Sometimes beer and snacks replaced food for me, imagine the damage) for so long that it became the norm for me, and when I was about 19 I pulled off a 26 days fast knowing absolutely nothing about it and making a ton of mistakes. The mistakes went as far as breaking my fast with vodka at a friend's birthday... yeah, I'm not going into detail here either, just don't do it.  
I am now 26 and made some mistakes this time too. Not as dramatic, fortunately.

There are already great posts breaking down the process of prolonged fasting day by day or period by period, so I'll add mine. There won't be anything new here, so consider it more of a confirmation that some fasting experienced are close to universal, but there's always a slight dispersion in day count since we're all different.

**Days \~1-3.**

The ""hardest"" part, as they say. I beg to differ, the worst is yet to begin. But it is indeed the hardest in terms of *hunger.* At times it might feel unbearable, especially if there's high level of food addiction. Not exactly my case, but I understand why many people here would consider the initial phase the hardest. Your brain does not want to say goodbye to food. But power through, and it will soon be gone.

**Day \~4-10.**

This is the first ""superpower"" stage of the fast. You will notice that the hunger is simply gone, as if your desire to eat was simply switched off. That's a great sensation! However, you will also notice that simple physical tasks and excercise begin to take a bigger toll. By the end of this period, your first exhausted crouched rest after going upstairs is likely to happen. This is also where constipation kicks in big time.

The best part? This is when your brain enters ""hunger mode"". Your mental pain won't process nor matter at this point. Your brain will be preoccupied with other things. Ancient survival mechanisms are now activated, there's no place for petty whining in there. Persist and you will break the cage and run.

**Around days \~8 to 14, you will suddenly feel like shit and lose a day of your life.**

As far as I know, this is sometimes referred to as *acidotic crisis.* On a longer fast, it is likely to happen twice or thrice. This has something to do with entering full ketosis, and is likely to end up in little beautiful things in life such as:

\- Constant nausea;  
\- Bile vomiting;  
\- Something nasty and slimy leaving your body through the backdoor, likely to be the stinkiest substance you ever encounter in your life. Ant it will be oozing out of YOUR body! Scary stuff if you believe in toxins and body cleansing and all that (did I just trigger the bot?).

Then, all of a sudden, all of it will be gone seemingly overnight. If you even manage to fall asleep. Which will also get progressively harder day by day even during the good periods.

Nasty ketosis taste and breath will set in and not leave until it's all over, except for a few short breaks when it suddenly went away for a couple of days closer to the end of the fast. THIS is why I don't believe that the initial stage is the hardest. What I find to be the WORST thing about fasting is the taste and plaque you can't wash off no matter how hard you scrub. That's it. It's the disgusting taste that doesn't go away no matter how you do and how many gallolitrepounds of mouthwash you process.

**After day \~14, you will be cycling through periods of crisis and periods of peace.**

The crises became easier to power through. During the calm days, I was feeling more euphoric than before and anxiety and regrets simply vanished. However, despite being full of psychological energy and feeling like a new person free from mental challenges of the past, physically I was exhausted. I skipped walks and excercise.

**By the end of the fast, something will happen.**

Around day 25, all the nasty symptoms disappeared. The constipation was there, but the gut felt clean. The ugly taste was GONE. The plaque was gone too! Some people believe that this is the natural signal that the fast is to be broken. However, I didn't wanna stop before I reach the 30 day mark... and you know what? This isn't any sort of sport and I was doing this for myself, you don't have to prove anything to anybody so perhaps those who believe that such periods are the right time to stop are correct. However, I didn't... a-a-and a couple of days later, the symptoms were back and I experienced yet another acidotic crisis, not as bad as the first one but neither as tame as previous. The taste lingered on up until the first drop of life-giving miso hit my tongue.

And that's about it!

I finished my bowl.

Now to the mistakes and tips:

\- I'd rather not drink coffee next time. Prolonged periods of hunger already make your heart racy enough.  
\- I failed to break my nicotine addiction. I am not a smoker, but I use smokeless tobacco pouches (snus). This lead to nausea and multiplied the foul taste. I would believe that it was the sole reason why the mouthfeel was particularly bad the whole time but reading other people's reports convinces me it wouldn't be nice either way.  
\- I'd force myself to walk and workout more, as there was too little physical activity after about day 16.  
\- I'd drink more, as organism gets dehydrated real fast even if you normally drink a lot and proceed to chug the same amounts of water. When there's no food intake, that's not enough. You really need to drink a ton to ease the drymouth and nasty keto taste.  
\- Salt is a great moral booster! Just don't overdo it, I guess. I used to simply pour a pinch on my tongue. Don't know if it's the right thing to do but it sure helped me.  
\- I substituted electrolytes with mineral water as this is a more available option where I live. So the only things that entered my body the whole month were water, mineral water and salt. And some coffee a couple of times, which I soon cancelled out. THIS IS NOT OPTIMAL. Follow proper advice, take electrolytes. I was stupid not to.  
However, retrospectively I felt tolerable the whole time (not counting the taste ofc) except for the really bad days where I threw up or suffered from toxic... backdoor explosions.. But nothing felt as if I was ""dying"".  
\- Don't tell anyone! You're doing it for yourself and it's a rather mystical and intimate process. The only time I shared this with a friend was circa day 15 when bro invited me to play some D&D and I didn't want to come over empty-handed, so I brought some potatos and my signature spice mix and made some roast potatoes at his place. So in order to not make a very suspicious scene where I don't eat the food I just made for others, I had to confess. He kept asking me how'm I doing till the very last day after that! It's sweet but I don't want anyone to worry too much about me, nor do I wan't anyone to think that I'm trying to make it look like a great heroic deed, as it clearly isn't.  
Everyone liked the taters btw

In conclusion, I'd like to say that I understand most people turn to water fasting for weight loss, and that's a great and important goal too. But since it wasn't that big of a problem or a goal for me, I can assure you that it's also a great cure for sickness of soul. Things that made me start my journey are such non-issues to me today! And to think, just a month ago I was thinking I'm worthless and my life is finished before it even properly started!

As of now, I feel very happy and ready to keep on with my life with a smile on my face.

Thanks for reading!

1n4ibiq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n4ibiq,Kitchenaid KCG8433 review and shim mod,"Hey everyone, so I picked up one of these kitchenaid grinders cheap second hand, and it can actually be a pretty pleasant grinder to use.  As people have said, this grinder doesn't grind fine enough as it is, but a single c-shaped shim from a soda can is all you need.  Now my shots are within times and taste pretty good for what I paid for.  
  
The bottom burr itself is 31.8mm in diameter and 20mm tall. The upper burr has 8 adjustment positions, which shifts the upper burr \~0.3mm, making each step adjustment \~0.375mm.  There are 70 steps on the main adjustment ring with each adjustment being \~0.019mm.  With the soda can shim itself being 0.11mm, you can bring the grind size down from 240 to (theoretically) 130 microns.  I found the specs [here](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/kitchenaid-coffee-grinder-5kcg8433-grind-settings/).

You just need a 10mm socket or adjustable wrench to remove the nut holding the burr down.  The thread is reverse threaded, so clockwise loosens it.  Remove both burrs, place your shim on top of the spinny thing, and reassemble.  You may need a pair of pliers to grab the spinny thing to tighten the lower burr down.

Other nice things:  
It's pretty cheap second hand.  I got mine for $65  
Nice and quiet!  
Static free and very low retention.  Makes my fellow opus look sloppy.  
Comes with a portafilter fork, holds 58-51mm portafilters  
The hopper auto closes when you want to change the beans  
Programmable grind by time.

I have the upper burr adjusted to setting 2 because I also grind for pourover and french press, and it's fine.

This grinder is probably not going to be a light roast hero, or grind amazingly fine or consistently or whatever.  But with a free mod this grinder has been a pleasure to use.  In comparison, my fellow opus just keeps eating my grinds - sometimes a whole gram goes missing.    
  
Keep in mind, I am using this with a 51mm portafilter.  This is probably not the best for larger portafilters.  But for a budget setup, I'd like to make the case the humble kitchenaid should at least be considered.",1,1756604160.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We hit it off right away. We opened up quickly about life, struggles, goals, and I eventually met many of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like we were building a solid, meaningful friendship.

Over time, though, I noticed how rigid and argumentative he could be. Conversations often felt like debates (even when they didn’t need to be) and he always had to be right. Still, I supported him a lot. I gave him relationship advice, career tips, and tried to be there when he needed someone. I honestly thought the support went both ways.

We got into a conversation about politics. He told me he was a DJT supporter and asked about my views, and I said I leaned Democrat. His response was, “That’s probably just because of your dad.” I explained that while my upbringing influenced me, my beliefs are still my own. He laughed and said, “How much?” I told him I didn’t want to quantify it, but he insisted, saying, “I’m going to assume a lot then” and then started trying to convince me that I actually agree with him more than I realize. It didn’t feel like a respectful conversation (it felt like he was trying to invalidate my stance and manipulate the direction of the discussion).

The next day, I texted him and said I didn’t appreciate the way he dismissed my views and made assumptions about me. I said an apology would suffice, not in a confrontational way, just to express that I felt disrespected.

He said he doesn’t like texting and preferred to talk in person. When we met up, I bought him a coffee at Starbucks and we sat down on a sofa and the whole thing exploded. He said I was trying to bring him down to my level, accused me of having low self-esteem, called me controlling and untrustworthy, sounded like the devil and said I “love conflict"" and even said I was bullying him at a given moment. It felt like he was unloading a bunch of resentment and going straight for personal attacks. I was stunned. I reminded him how much I’d supported him in the past (not to guilt him, just to show that I’ve always acted in good faith). He accused me of being manipulative and trying to make him feel bad for me.

He ended the conversation by saying, “This friendship is over,” and insisted on doing a prayer with me and I declined respectfully saying it wasn't about that. He got up and told me to hug him which I also declined but extended my hand to shake and he shook it then walked away.

Afterward, I sent him one last message and blocked him:

“I don’t feel bad about myself, Lucas, nor do I have low self-esteem. I’m okay the way I am—even better than some people, to be honest.What really bothered me was how you turned a simple request into a character assassination.People make mistakes, including you—you even joke about them sometimes. But today you took things to a different level, throwing insults at me non-stop.I don’t deserve that kind of treatment. I’m not interested in being friends after this. Ciao for now.”

It's been 7 months of no contact but absolutely no one has sided with me out of the entire church I use to go to (I stopped going for 7 months now). For some reason his close friend keeps reaching out every 2-3 months and it seems performative or like he's trying to collect info and report back to Lucas.",3,1756604033.0,AskMenAdvice,6,0.71,False

I've been working from home since almost 3 years now and as a consequence have sort of lost my overall circle. Would be great to connect with like minded individuals. Also, would be great if you can suggest some socialising events / groups. Tried an Arts council course but was pretty far for me and the hours were difficult.
We can do coffee, bowling, paddle or maybe just chat.

  ?WE HAVE PROBLEMS. ?  
  
  Caden MacTavish rolled his eyes. If Bram Rion thought that was news, it came two weeks too late.  
  
  Hovering on the edge of a bottle green armchair, Caden watched Merlin?s grandson slam the door to his palatial home office, locking the Doomsday Brethren into the edgy silence with him. Each were warriors in their own way, most magical. All had the kind of mettle that would have been welcome in the Marine platoon in which Caden had served.  
  
  Without Bram?s Hollywood smile, magickind?s Brad Pitt looked both jumpy and grave. In fact, all the wizards, and Marrok, the former immortal and King Arthur?s champion, looked grim. The tension ratcheted up, and Caden?s thoughts drifted to his absent brother Lucan, a Doomsday Brethren warrior.  
  
  Please God, let this end soon.  
  
  A loud crash upstairs thumped the ceiling, shook the walls. A woman screamed, terror bleeding from her voice. On the upper floor, a door crashed open, the shrieking grew louder, and footsteps pounded above him. She was running down the stairs. Heading out the door.  
  
  Tearing out of the library, Caden raced to the shrieking blond woman, ignoring Bram?s shout calling him back. He grabbed the frantic witch by her shoulders. Though likely over two hundred, she looked deceptively young. Her wide green eyes were glazed with fear.  
  
  ?Wait. Please. ? He caught her anxious gaze. ?My brother??  
  
  ?I can?t. ? Her voice quivered. ?He?s big and feral and? snarled that I smell of another man. He ripped his ch-chains. ? Her words broke with new tears. ?And lunged for my throat. ?  
  
  Caden closed his eyes and held in a curse. The fifth energy surrogate Lucan had frightened away in two weeks. Now what?  
  
  At the top of the stairs, Bram?s sister Sabelle appeared. Her lace shirt and golden hair were askew, but her demeanor was calm. ?I have Lucan under control. Let her go. ?  
  
  Instead, Caden clasped the witch tighter. If he released her, what would become of his brother? ?He needs her. Without the energy she generates . . . ?  
  
  Caden couldn?t finish the sentence. The thought.  
  
  ?He?ll die. ? Sabelle sighed. ?He misses Anka so deeply that it?s unhinged him mentally. My Aunt Millie says she?s never seen a case of mate mourning this severe. ?  
  
  More dreadful news. Where was the freaking light at the end of the tunnel? Bram and Sabelle had dragged him away from his peaceful life in Dallas two weeks ago; the hell hadn?t let up since. Frustration ate his gut like acid. He didn?t want to fail Lucan. Years ago, he?d been unable to save his younger brother. Damned if he?d let his older one die, too.  
  
  ?If Lucan isn?t taking the energy to survive from these women, how can he have enough strength to fight them??  
  
  ?Primal rage,? Sabelle supplied. ?When the surrogates come, it?s as if he?s defending an attack. It?s a delusion, and we can?t explain otherwise to him. All his senses, except smell, have shut down. Surrogates bring the smells of their other clients along unwittingly. Lucan fights back. ?  
  
  ?Maybe . . . it?s time to consider that he wants death,? Bram murmured behind him.  
  
  Fury slashed through Caden. What kind of friend even thought that? Caden had held the hands of fallen comrades in Iraq and prayed for their recovery . . . even as some rattled their last breath.  
  
  ?My brother will not die like this! I will find Anka and bring her back. ?  
  
  ?It may be too late. Let the witch go,? Bram demanded.  
  
  ?Please,? the scared blonde pleaded.  
  
  Caden shook with rage. He wanted to crush something, punch a wall, lash out at magic, which had again screwed up his life. But the sobbing witch in his grasp shrank back in fear, like he, too, was a monster.  
  
  For about the two hundredth time since returning to England a fortnight ago, Caden cursed magic. To a human male, the loss of a beloved wife could be emotionally devastating. But as a wizard, Lucan?s loss had reduced a perfectly sane person to a rabid animal. The man upstairs wasn?t the older brother Caden had idolized as a child.  
  
  Though he?d left his childhood home a dozen years ago, and disavowed anything or anyone associated with magic, now that tragedy had struck, and he might lose his only remaining brother, a guilt seared Caden. The thought of never speaking to Lucan again? Unthinkable.  
  
  He must restore Lucan?s mental health. To do that, he had to find Anka and return her to his brother?s arms? quickly. And clearly, the witch Caden currently detained couldn?t help.  
  
  With a sigh, he released her. ?Go. ?  
  
  She sprinted out and closed the door. Silence reverberated.  
  
  ?Come back to my office,? Bram said.  
  
  Caden whirled on the wizard. ?I won?t give up on my brother, damn you!?  
  
  With a twitch of Bram?s finger, Caden was magically hauled back into the office. Caden seethed with resentment as Bram slammed the door behind them. He opened his mouth to give the wizard a furious earful, but Bram held up a hand.  
  
  ?I understand your frustration. But our difficulties aren?t merely about you and your family. These problems affect us all. ? He gestured to the other three men in the room. ?And the rest of magickind. ?  
  
  ?My brother is chained to a bed like a lunatic, Anka is missing, and we haven?t a single clue where she?s gone. We cannot make Lucan whole without her return. Nothing is more important. ?  
  
  ?I wish. Our other problems are many and grave. ?  
  
  Ice Rykard, another of the warriors, was a big man, but when annoyance stamped his square, hollow-cheeked face, like now, sane people backed away. ?You summoned me here to tell me what I already know??  
  
  As Ice rose to leave, Bram blocked his path. ?Something new has arisen. Prudence requires that we attend to it. All of us. ?  
  
  Bram refused to help his brother, then sought his assistance? Caden would have laughed if he weren?t so furious. ?I came only to find my brother?s missing mate??  
  
  ?Former mate,? Bram corrected. ?Their bond is broken. ?  
  
  ?Involuntarily,? Caden stressed. ?I?ve no doubt Lucan still regards Anka as his, and they were in love. Why would she not welcome him back? I?m here to find her so they can bond again, not solve your problems. ?  
  
  Bram sighed. ?Lucan is my best friend, and I want more than anything to make him whole again. But that is a mission of mercy. The other matters are of life and death. ?  
  
  ?If you do not help me find Anka, Lucan will die!?  
  
  ?If we fail to act on this new problem, thousands, maybe millions, will die. Including Lucan. ?  
  
  Sacrificing one for many. Bram had shoved this ?necessity? down Caden?s throat before. His patience was wearing thin. Exhaling, he rubbed gritty eyes. Every day, worrying. Every night, not sleeping?he often paced, Lucan?s mad countenance swimming in his mind. Meanwhile his brother?s ?friends? worried about everyone else.  
  
  ?Please. ? Simon Northam, or Duke, the youngest of the Doomsday Brethren, drilled him with a stare. ?We need you as much as Lucan. The sooner we tend to these issues, the sooner we can help him. ?  
  
  Caden felt four pairs of eyes locked on him. Except for the fact Bram had kept a roof over Lucan?s head, he owed these men nothing. He?d known them a mere fortnight, wanted nothing to do with magickind and their problems. But their stares accused him of abandoning them . . . and Lucan?s cause. Guilt twisted in his gut.  
  
  Blast them! He merely wanted peace and solitude since witnessing half his friends dying in Iraq. Of the few who had survived, two had returned home, only to commit suicide. Another was in prison, unable to make the transition from shooting terrorists in a desert shithole to walking the dog in suburbia. The last had gone missing following a training exercise at his home base. The tragic death of Caden?s younger brother nearly two decades ago had proved that magic?s body count was even more shocking and heartbreaking. He?d had enough of loss,  
of death. As soon as Lucan recovered, Caden would return to his sedate life as a staff photographer for a Dallas newspaper. No one died taking pictures of city council meetings.  
  
  ?The Doomsday Brethren means a great deal to Lucan,? Bram reminded.  
  
  Manipulative bastard.  
  
  ?Besides, you may soon need us. Your magic is coming . . . ?  
  
  Caden prayed that his sleeplessness was merely anxiety, stress, and not a harbinger of his own coming transition into magic. But there was no denying the electrical surges and flashes of emotion racing through his body of late. He feared that the witching hour?in this case, his thirtieth birthday?was approaching. ?Not if I can help it. ?  
  
  ?You can?t. ? Bram shrugged. ?If you have the magic gene, it?s coming. ?  
  
  Marrok, the human warrior-giant who looked every inch a medieval knight, from the slash of straight hair that reached his shoulders to the sword strapped to his hip, frowned at Bram. ?Does this new problem concern Shock? Have we yet heard from the varlet??  
  
  The shadiest member of the Doomsday Brethren had been MIA since their battle two weeks ago with the evil wizard Mathias, who sought to control magickind with the help of his minions, the Anarki. During that skirmish, Shock had suddenly appeared to switch his loyalties to the other side. No surprise there, given the man?s dark background. Because Shock was both Anka?s previous suitor and cozy with Mathias, Bram thought he might be willing to divulge Anka?s whereabouts. Caden disagreed. Mathias had brutalized Anka after abducting her and forcing her to break her mate bond with Lucan. Shock had apparently done nothing to help her.  
  
  Bram, Ice, and Duke all shook their heads.  
  
  ?Nothing? That is vexing,? Marrok snarled. ?Surely he has told Mathias much about us. ?  
  
  ?It?s Mathias?s quiet that disturbs me,? Ice cut in. ?Two weeks of it . . . Right dodgy. Makes me itch. ?  
  
  If Caden cared about magickind, he?d agree. But his only mission was to determine what Mathias had done with Anka and return her in the hopes of restoring Lucan?s sanity.  
  
  ?During our last battle, Olivia laid a bolt of power on Mathias that should have flattened the bastard,? drawled Duke. Clad head to toe in designer everything, he looked perfectly urbane and wealthy, the artful muss of his dark hair cut perfectly, just like his aristocratic features, all the way down to his cleft chin. ?It appeared to deplete his magic and should have prevented him from rising again, but . . . ?  
  
  ?This is Mathias,? Ice finished.  
  
  Exactly. If Mathias regained even half his power, the small but determined cabal of warriors assembled under Bram?s direction were screwed, and every man in the room knew it. How could the Doomsday Brethren kill a wizard who had already returned from the dead once? He had an army of slaves at his disposal. Caden could count the Doomsday Brethren on one hand.  
  
  Bram winced. ?I?m afraid, gentlemen, our problems are worse than that. ?  
  
  Marrok muttered, ?Would that we knew from whence Mathias found so many disposable recruits. ?  
  
  Those were troubling, indeed. Mathias had stripped the souls from human bodies to create walking dead Anarki, for the purpose of helping Mathias enslave magickind and destroy the Doomsday Brethren. During their last battle, the black-blooded zombies had been plentiful?and immune to magic.  
  
  ?All true,? Bram conceded. ?But I called you here to discuss something even more critical. ?  
  
  Ice cast him a cutting stare. ?Your magical signature tells me you took a human mate last night? A problem, indeed. ?  
  
  Caden?s jaw dropped. Bram, one of the most pedigreed wizards today, had taken a human mate?  
  
  ?Wouldn?t your grandfather be proud?? Ice sneered. ?Merlin prized that pure bloodline. Pity. ?  
  
  Bram charged toward Ice. ?Shut your bloody mouth, you fu??  
  
  ?Cease!? Marrok grabbed him and held him back.  
  
  Caden was inclined to help. Bram and Ice were always at each other?s throats. If Bram needed wizards loyal to him for the Doomsday Brethren, why the devil had he picked Ice to join?  
  
  ?Piss off!? Bram growled.  
  
  ?We can fight no enemy if we are too busy fighting one another,? Marrok advised.  
  
  ?Beating in the tosser?s skull would make me feel better. ?  
  
  ?What has you on edge?? Duke asked.  
  
  Caden wondered the same thing. Bram was usually the voice of sanity amidst all this magical muck. At the moment, he behaved as if he was crawling out of his skin, one step away from the mental ward.  
  
  ?Where is your mate?? Ice added fuel to the fire. ?I?d like to offer her my condolences. ?  
  
  ?My mate is none of your concern. However, the Book of Doomsday is. ? Bram hesitated, then rolled his shoulders. ?Last night, while I slept, she found it. ?  
  
  ?Found it? Lying about?? Duke demanded.  
  
  ?It was hidden. ? Bram rubbed the back of his neck. ?She must have searched for it. ?  
  
  An ominous gong clanged in Caden?s gut. Magickind wasn?t his issue, but if that book disappeared . . . everyone, magical and human, was at risk.  
  
  ?She cozied up to you to find the book?? Ice looked ready to laugh.  
  
  Bram didn?t have to answer; the humiliation on his face did it for him.  
  
  ?Shut up!? Caden glared at the stubble-headed wizard, then turned back to Bram. ?What happened? Where is the diary??  
  
  ?She took it and disappeared. ?  
  
  Bram?s quiet admission resounded through the room.  
  
  ?Fuck,? Ice muttered.  
  
  ?You have no idea where it is?? Caden struggled to pick his jaw off the floor. ?Where she is??  
  
  ?None. ?  
  
  ?Double fuck,? came Ice again.  
  
  The Doomsday Diary was the ultimate weapon in the magical war. Used properly, it was rumored to grant any wish, up to and including the world?s annihilation. People had died in Mathias?s quest to obtain it. Lucan?s life was in shambles because of it. The Doomsday Brethren had formed and were fighting a war to protect it. If Mathias obtained the book and used it to bring about doomsday?well, that was everyone?s problem. I second what Ice said,? Caden muttered.  
  
  ?You had no magical protections on the book?? Duke asked.  
  
  ?Of course. Against anyone magical. I never imagined a human would know of the book?s existence, much less that I had it. The only way she could know is if she?s Mathias?s pawn. I worry . . . What if he has the diary now? What will he do to her?? Bram paced, raking a frantic hand through his golden hair.  
  
  Marrok planted a friendly hand on Bram?s shoulder. ?Use your bond to find her. ?  
  
  With a shake of his golden hair, Bram sighed in frustration. ?I can?t and I don?t understand why. I should be able to . . . It?s confounding me. ?  
  
  ?You touched her, aye?? Marrok asked. ?Did you not use your powers to read her mind??  
  
  ?Yes . . . and no. I could read her body with my touch, but not her thoughts. I?ve never encountered such a woman before. ?  
  
  Duke sighed. ?What the devil should we do now??  
  
  Panic? Caden kept the thought to himself.  
  
  ?Not to add to our problems, but have you seen this?? Duke slid a newspaper in the middle of Bram?s desk. The bold black headline screamed Supernatural Forces Battle in South London Tunnel.  
  
  Bram glanced at the paper. ?Out of This Realm? It?s a rag. No one takes that rubbish seriously. ?  
  
  Not true. Back home, several of the reporters at the Dallas Morning News were addicted to the paper?s imaginative stories. They were more creative than The National Enquirer?s.  
  
  ?That may change after this issue?s lead article. The byline belongs to a reporter named Sydney Blair. She?s disturbingly close to the truth. Most news outlets wrote off the battle with Mathias as a foiled terrorist act, a gang initiation, or the work of a madman. Ms. Blair calls it ?an ongoing clash between powerful factions within magickind. ? ?  
  
  Bram?s eyes bulged. ?How the bloody hell does she even know there?s a magickind, much less an ongoing battle? Few in magickind know of Mathias?s return. ?  
  
  Though Caden had eschewed magic long ago, even he knew the necessity of keeping magickind?s existence a secret from humans. Witch hunts, trials for heresy, and burnings at the stake weren?t distant memories for a society whose citizens often lived to be one thousand. The seventeenth century was, relatively speaking, last year. No one was na?ve enough to think that technology was any insurance policy against genocide. People still killed what they didn?t understand.  
  
  ?I consulted Peers and People of Magickind before coming here. I found no mention of her,? Duke said. ?She is no witch, nor is she mated to a wizard. ?  
  
  ?Human? Mayhap she?s one of Mathias?s soulless minions,? Marrok suggested.  
  
  ?If Mathias wanted to influence humanity, he wouldn?t take over a tabloid reporter?s mind to do it,? Bram assured. ?Besides, if she?s still leading a human life, she could not do so looking like an undead Anarki. The other humans notice walking cadavers. ?  
  
  ?So she?s fully human,? Duke surmised. ?And frightfully well informed. ?  
  
  ?Or perhaps . . . ? Ice glared at him. ?She?s getting her information from someone who rejected magickind and would celebrate its end. ?  
  
  ?Me?? Caden jumped in the big wizard?s face. ?I?ve no love for magic, true, but I would never advocate mass murder. Besides, ending you all would mean my brother?s death. Would I be here saving him if I was willing to kill magickind??  
  
  Duke nodded, the cooler head prevailing. ?He?s right. ?  
  
  Muttering, Ice backed away. Barely.  
  
  Turning back to the newspaper, Duke went on, ?Whoever she is, she?s dangerous. The rest of the article is equally disturbing. ?The bodies discovered in the tunnel are decomposed far beyond expected, given their recent deaths. ? ?  
  
  ?This is no secret. ? Marrok waved his words away. ?The media has been scratching over that like a mongrel with fleas. ?  
  
  ?Listen further,? Duke barked. ? ?Out of This Realm has learned the bodies bear new wounds and fresh traces of gunpowder, suggesting they somehow fought in the battle, rather than merely being left behind as a macabre message. It appears as if they were actually more dead than alive prior to the battle, but able to fight due to evil magic. ? ?  
  
  ?She?s guessing,? said Bram.  
  
  But even he didn?t sound convinced. Caden winced.  
  
  Duke shook his head. ?Here?s more: ?According to an anonymous source, there?s a mad wizard on the loose once more, allegedly fighting social injustice in the magical world. He?ll stop at nothing to tear down the establishment and replace it with his version of anarchy. ? ?  
  
  Caden shook his head. Poor magical bastards.  
  
  ?Who is this anonymous source?? Bram demanded.  
  
  Duke laced his fingers together with quiet concern. ?Ms. Blair claims it?s ?a witch who recently found herself tangled in this magical war. ? ?  
  
  ?A witch?? Ice spat. ?Who knows so much??  
  
  Caden?s heart stuttered and adrenaline charged. ?Anka. ?  
  
  ?Or perhaps any of the other missing women, like Craddock?s daughter,? Ice pointed out. ?But what witch in her right mind would spill sensitive secrets to a bloody reporter??  
  
  Who knew? Still . . . ?It could be Anka,? Caden insisted.  
  
  And possibly the first clue Caden had discovered to her whereabouts in a fortnight.  
  
  ?Whoever her source, Sydney Blair knows there?s a magickind, that we?re at war, and that Mathias is supposedly fighting the Social Order,? Duke insisted.  
  
  ?The moment anyone actually listens, humanity will hunt us. It?ll make the Inquisition seem like a bloody holiday. ? Bram raked a hand through his disheveled golden hair and continued to pace. ?And if Mathias reads this, her life may well be in danger. We must handle this situation immediately. ?  
  
  Bram leaned back against his desk. The morning sun slanted through the office?s open shutters, showing just how much strain the wizard was enduring. He swallowed, then pinned a wily gaze on Caden that made his blood freeze. ?I know how we can deal with Ms. Blair. You?ve worked at a newspaper. ?  
  
  Caden sent him a wary glance. ?So??  
  
  ?Offer your services as a photographer and shut her up, before she reveals anything more about magickind. ?  
  
  He didn?t want to get involved. ?Why don?t you visit her and do that wizard mind-reading trick of yours??  
  
  ?Only works if I?m touching a woman?deeply. Now that I?m mated . . . well, I can no longer get that close to Sydney Blair, or any woman except mine. So you?ll have to go and pry information from her the human way. ?  
  
  Caden?s thoughts raced. Perhaps he could placate them and help his brother. If he worked for Ms. Blair, he could discern if her anonymous source was Anka.  
  
  Bram smiled tightly. Bloody bastard had Caden by the balls and he knew it. In order to make Lucan whole, he must find his brother?s mate. At the moment, the reporter was his best?and only?lead.  
  
  ?Have we come to the part yet where I spank you??  
  
  Sydney Blair closed her eyes as the last notes of ?Happy Birthday? echoed through the small conference room. Had her perpetually randy coworker, Jamie, actually suggested a little light S&M with the entire staff of Out of This Realm looking on?  
  
  A dozen of the newspaper?s employees twittered with nervous laughter, except her yummy new photographer, Caden MacTavish. Mortified, Sydney risked a glance at him. The taut arms bunched over his wide chest and the chilly blue of his watchful eyes made her wince.  
  
  Sydney slowly turned to the office lothario with a glare that let him know how little she appreciated his comment. He merely wagged his brows at her and grinned from ear to ear.  
  
  ?Have we come to the part yet where you leave?? Caden countered.  
  
  The words somehow sounded polite. Caden had that upper crust Londoner sound, though muted by time elsewhere. But he could still say most anything and sound civilized. His current expression, on the other hand, rivaled Attila the Hun?s on a bad day.  
  
  ?You think you should be first to have a go at her?? Jamie challenged Caden. ?I?ve seen how you stare. ?  
  
  Sydney went hot all over?from more than simple embarrassment. Caden lit her up like a millennium fireworks s  
how. She?d be thrilled if the man had sexual thoughts of her. But in the few days she?d worked with him, he had not appeared to notice her more than professionally, despite Jamie?s delusions to the contrary.  
  
  ?Bad karma!? Aquarius, her flower-child assistant, scolded. ?Mellow!?  
  
  Neither spared a glance for the little waif. Silver bracelets tinkling, Aquarius reached out to Caden. Whether she intended to soothe him or test his aura, Sydney didn?t know. She shot a warning glance at her assistant. Now was not a good time for her healing-crystal/save-the-world routine.  
  
  ?You may find this concept hard to grasp,? Caden asserted, ?but some men are capable of admiring more about a woman than what?s in her knickers. ?  
  
  Jamie scoffed. ?If he?s a nancy boy. ?  
  
  Sydney smothered a laugh. Caden was definitely not gay. Despite that, she felt certain he?d never considered what went in her knickers. ?Stop it, both of you! This is a birthday party, not a brawl. ?  
  
  ?What?s your wish?? asked Leslie from Circulation, trying to smooth the tension.  
  
  A romping shag with Caden, but since that wasn?t likely to happen . . . head reporter had a lovely ring to it. Sure, she worked for a paranormal tabloid that few took seriously, but it paid the bills. Soon, she hoped to make a name for herself writing stories that traditional journalists eschewed. And people everywhere would recognize her once she found proof of the supernatural. Until then she would write about the world she believed must exist?and her parents had utterly rejected. Besides, Out of This Realm was a scream to work at. Where else could she collect a salary for chasing Ripper ghosts and conducting interviews at the London Psychic Centre?  
  
  Her personal life, on the other hand? Disaster. How did one manage to become a sad spinster at twenty-eight? The endless string of dates from her uni days had been replaced with deadlines and staff meetings. Her last boyfriend . . . his pretty face had failed to compensate for the fact he had the IQ of a dead houseplant and the emotional range of a pea. Perhaps she should wish for a man.  
  
  For Caden.  
  
  Yummy waves of chocolate hair with caramel streaks, fathomless blue eyes, a body that belonged in magazines? and a reserved exterior that made her long to know the man beneath. Too bad the attraction didn?t run both ways. She sighed.  
  
  ?She can?t tell us her wish or it won?t come true,? Holly, her editor, pointed out, then faced Sydney. ?Now stop fannying about and open your gifts. ?  
  
  Sydney looked at the gifts on the table, but her gaze strayed to Caden, who continued glaring at Jamie.  
  
  He was a puzzle, that one.  
  
  From the moment Caden had walked in the door, he?d been fixated on that battle in the South London tunnel a few weeks back. He?d said her story about the magical war was utter rubbish . . . but asked a load of questions, especially about her source. Not that Sydney would tell him?or anyone else?the woman?s name. Impossible, anyway. She didn?t know it.  
  
  Aquarius distracted the tense crowd by shoving a bright pink floral-wrapped box into Sydney?s hands. From the number of packages stacked on the small round table in the conference room, it looked as if everyone had brought her something.  
  
  ?You shouldn?t have gone to such trouble. ?  
  
  ?We want to show you how much we appreciate you,? said Leslie.  
  
  Aquarius started pouring cups of her infamous homeblended herbal tea as Sydney unwrapped gifts. A pair of delicate silver earrings, a relaxing massage at a local day spa, and a sumptuous Italian silk scarf trimmed in blue crushed velvet. Jamie gave her a gift certificate for a large pizza and a Blockbuster card?both of which he?d likely insist on sharing. Caden had given her a somewhat impersonal card and a small box of nice chocolates. She would have preferred a hungry kiss.  
  
  Wrapping paper and greeting cards littered the table when Sydney at last got to Aquarius?s package. The young woman was practically vibrating with excitement. ?Open this! It?s from me. ?  
  
  ?You baked and organized and still got me something? You shouldn?t have. ?  
  
  With the butterfly tattoo on her shoulder and her mesh and lace top, Aquarius didn?t dress like a normal assistant and refused to make coffee?too full of chemicals and caffeine. She wasn?t good with a computer . . . yet. But Aquarius had a knack for stories, for juggling Sydney?s hectic schedule, fielding the editor-in-chief, soothing paranoid readers and keeping internal chaos at a minimum. And despite being total opposites, she and Aquarius had become good friends. Sydney smiled at the thought.  
  
  ?Are you two going to start snogging or are you going to open that?? Jamie hollered.  
  
  After tossing another glare at Jamie, Sydney turned to the gift. It was square and slightly heavy. Aquarius had wrapped it in buttery yellow linen and an over layer of white lace? different from her usual recycled choice.  
  
  ?Open it. Go on,? she whispered.  
  
  An odd anticipation revved through Sydney as she plucked at the silky white bow and tore open the wrapping to reveal . . . a book. An old-fashioned book. A red leather cover with gilt framing and some sort of scripty-looking symbol on the front. Sydney tried to hide her confusion.  
  
  Caden elbowed in and gave the book a very hard stare.  
  
  Aquarius laughed and urged her, ?Read the card inside. ?  
  
  With a shrug, she opened the cover to reveal. Hmm . . . An empty book with ever-so-slightly yellowed pages and a little white square of paper with a formal-looking script that read:

1n4i7hp,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1n4i7hp/help/,Help!,"Okay so I think I might have POTS and honestly I feel like I need a new doctor at this point. Back in May I had this week where my resting heart rate was super high and even just going for a walk or doing a light workout would leave me completely winded. My HR would shoot into the 150s. I went to the ER and they ran a full panel — EKG was fine, everything “looked normal.” They sent me to Heart & Vascular, I wore a 48-hour Holter, also came back fine. Then I saw my dad’s cardiologist who did another EKG and even a tilt table test and said I was fine. But then when i got home i did my own tilt table test bc i have a bp machine and hr monitor and it was way off. My heart rate was high and bp was low laying, sitting and standing. Anyways, after telling my physician this she mentioned pots. 

Those symptoms have mostly gone away or are really mild now. But lately something new has started that’s honestly way worse. If I have even half a glass of coffee or one glass of wine, the next day I get insanely overheated, have to run to the bathroom, end up with diarrhea, and feel so faint I’m basically stuck in bed for two days. It happens every single time with alcohol or coffee.

I have no clue what’s happening and it’s making me feel like I’m losing my mind. Has anyone else with POTS or similar issues experienced this?",0,1756603811.0,POTS,3,0.33,False

  Paul Rogan didn’t consider himself a religious man, but that commandment played over and over in his head as he stepped into the lobby. As his wing tips clicked on the polished marble floor, those four words beat inside him.  
  
  As he’d done every weekday morning for eleven years—minus holidays, sick days, and vacations—he swiped his company ID at check-in.  
  
  Stu, manning security, gave him a nod. “Monday again, huh, Mr. Rogan.”  
  
  “Monday,” Rogan muttered and turned, as he did every Monday morning, to the elevator banks.  
  
  Behind his back, Stu smirked a little. It looked like Mr. Rogan had himself a big-ass Monday morning hangover.  
  
  Rogan stepped into an elevator along with a handful of other execs, some admins, a couple of assistants. He wore a dark, pinstriped suit over an athletic frame, a crisp white shirt, and a blue-and-red chevron-pattern tie in a single Windsor knot.  
  
  Despite his cashmere topcoat, the cold seeped into his bones as he listened to the voice in his head.  
  
  Cecily. Melody.  
  
  The voice spoke the names, again and again even as four words pounded out a rhythm.  
  
  Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not kill.  
  
  And yet.  
  
  He stepped out on the thirty-second floor—executive level, Quantum Air. The logo, the silver whoosh of it streaked over the wall behind the curve of the reception counter. Already the ’links and comps beeped and hummed. The waiting area, empty at this hour, sat quiet and plush. Another wall, all tinted glass, opened the room to New York, its sky and skyline.  
  
  Blue today that sky, so blue, he thought as he stared a moment. How could it be so blue, so clear?  
  
  He turned from it and, without his usual words for the trio at reception, walked to the double glass doors.  
  
  They opened, splitting the logo’s whoosh in two. He understood what it meant to be split in two.  
  
  Cecily. Melody.  
  
  Thou shalt not kill.  
  
  He passed assistants, admin stations, offices. Though it was still just shy of nine, men and women in sharp suits sat at desks, opened briefcases, sipped their fancy coffees while studying reports.  
  
  His own admin jumped up. So young, so bright, so earnest, Rogan thought. He’d been the same, just the same, once upon a time.  
  
  “Good morning, Mr. Rogan. I updated your tablet for the nine o’clock conference. It’s on your desk. If you’re ready to go over some of the updates—”  
  
  “Not necessary. No calls, Rudy.”  
  
  Rudy opened his mouth to speak, but Rogan closed the door to his office. Though he frowned when he heard the click of the lock, Rudy decided his boss just needed a few before the big meeting.  
  
  Inside his office, Rogan begged, bargained, pleaded. The voice inside his head never changed in tone. Utterly calm, utterly cold. When another voice came through, desperate and terrified, he wept.  
  
  He trembled as he removed his topcoat. Once again he stared through a glass wall at the blue sky, as he stood in an office he’d worked diligently to earn.  
  
  It all ended today, as February dribbled into March 2061. Eleven years since he’d come aboard Quantum as a junior exec.  
  
  The voice gave him only two choices, so he had no choice at all.  
  
  Surrendering, he followed the instructions inside his head and opened his briefcase.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  At eight-fifty-six, he stepped out of his office. Rudy popped up again.  
  
  “Mr. Rogan, I wanted to tell you I added a few more notes, some personal data on Ms. Karson. Just chat points.”  
  
  “All right, Rudy.” He paused a moment, looking into that young, earnest face. “You do good work. You’ve been an asset to me, and to Quantum Air.”  
  
  “Thanks.” Rudy brightened. “It’s a big day.”  
  
  “Yes, a big day.”  
  
  Feeling the weight of it, Rogan walked to the conference room. “Please stop,” he murmured as his heart beat like a brutal fist inside his chest.  
  
  Inside the conference room, the blue sky, the sweep of downtown Manhattan, the glint of the river gleamed through the tinted glass. On the wall, the screen held steady and silent with the silver logo.  
  
  On the long, polished table, silver trays held glossy pastries, perfectly ripened fruit, pitchers of water—sparkling or still. China cups waited for assistants to fill them with tea or coffee.  
  
  Reps from EconoLift—one male, one female—sat studying tablets with cups and glasses at their elbows. Two of Rogan’s associates did the same. Lawyers and accountants from each company filled more seats.  
  
  “There needs to be another way.”  
  
  At Rogan’s murmur, Sandy Plank—senior VP, accounting—gave him a quizzical glance.  
  
  But Rogan only heard the voice in his head.  
  
  At nine sharp, the doors opened again. Derrick Pearson, Quantum’s president and CEO, stood for a moment surveying the room. His black and silver mane flowing, he entered along with Willimina Karson.  
  
  In heeled boots, Karson—Econo’s president—stood six foot one inch. They made an imposing pair, Pearson in his severe black suit and silver tie, Karson in her straight-line red dress and short jacket.  
  
  Everyone around the table stood.  
  
  “Good morning, everyone,” Pearson said in his lion’s roar of a voice. “Let’s bring in Chicago, New L.A., Atlanta, London, Rome.”  
  
  As he rattled off cities, the screen flashed into sections, those sections flashed with other conference rooms or offices, more people in suits.  
  
  The voice in Rogan’s head spoke incessantly, sharper and sharper. Then added screams.  
  
  Rogan took two staggering steps forward, interrupting Derrick’s opening greeting.  
  
  “Paul.” More surprised than annoyed, Pearson touched a hand to Karson’s arm. “Willimina, you’ve met Paul. Paul Rogan, our VP of marketing.”  
  
  “Derrick . . . I don’t have a choice. I’m sorry.”  
  
  Something in his voice, something in his eyes, had Karson stepping back even as Pearson stepped forward.  
  
  “Are you all right, Paul?” he asked, gripping Rogan’s arm.  
  
  “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”  
  
  Rudy, dashing toward the conference room with the tablet Rogan had left on his desk, got within three strides of the doors before they blew.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Lieutenant Eve Dallas stood amid the carnage. The air stank of blood, charred flesh, piss, and vomit. Water from the sprinkler system soaked into the carpet so it squished underfoot. With her boots and hands already sealed, she studied the room.  
  
  The blast had blown off the doors, shattered most of the mega screen, blown chunks off the table, sent chairs and people flying—and some burning.  
  
  The thick carpet no  
w bore a wide, blackened hole, and the walls as well as the floor carried spatter—blood, brains, other bodily fluids.  
  
  Lieutenant Lisbeth Salazar, heading up the Explosives and Bombs Unit, stood with her.  
  
  “Eleven dead, nine injured. The dead include the bomber. We’re picking up the pieces there . . .”  
  
  Both women watched the sweepers in their protective white suits, the boomer hounds in their thick gray, comb the room.  
  
  “But we’ve got some wits from the other side of the room, more shaken than stirred, who state Paul Rogan, VP of marketing, revealed a suicide vest seconds before he detonated it. I can tell you from the extent of damage, it was either designed for short-range effect, or it piffed and that’s all he got. I’m estimating a range of twelve to fifteen feet.”  
  
  “You’re saying it could’ve been worse.”  
  
  “Oh, a whole hell of a bunch worse.” Salazar—an imposing woman with skin the color of well-steeped tea, eyes of flaming green—gestured. “He was facing away from the table, angled toward the door—toward Derrick Pearson, CEO. He blew Pearson with him, and the people at the front section of the table. It looks like some of the DBs took chunks of the table and the shrapnel as COD rather than the actual explosion.  
  
  “We’ve swept,” Salazar added. “And we’re sweeping again—the entire building. But I’m saying this was the only device, this was the only bomber.”  
  
  Eve noted the spears of wood and metal impaled in the walls, the webbing cracks on the wall of glass. But the bulk of the damage, the radius of the blast? Yeah, around twelve feet.  
  
  “How’d he get it in the building?”  
  
  “Briefcase—lead-lined. He breezed right through the standards, and he’s worked here nearly a dozen years. Security had no reason to wand or ray him. I did a run, the guy’s got no record. Married going on fourteen years. An eight-year-old daughter.”  
  
  “Where are they, the wife and kid?”  
  
  “I sent some uniforms to pick them up. You and the ME make the call, Dallas, but this looks like homicide to me. It’s not terrorism, domestic or otherwise, on the face of it. Maybe the guy flipped out, who knows? Some big deal supposed to go down today—here. Maybe he didn’t want it to go down. We’ll pick up the pieces, and we’ll tell you what kind of boomer.”  
  
  Eve stood tall and lean in the long leather coat. Her hair, short, choppy and brown, haloed a face of angles, with a shallow dent in the chin. Her eyes, brown, sharp, and all cop, swept the room again.  
  
  “You handle your end, I’ll handle mine. Let’s see where we end up.”  
  
  “Works for me.” Salazar pulled out her signaling communicator. “Salazar.”  
  
  “Lieutenant, neither Cecily Greenspan nor Melody Rogan showed up at the school this morning where the kid attends and the mother is assistant principal. The mother texted in that the kid wasn’t feeling well. They don’t answer their ’links.”  
  
  Salazar’s brows lifted, and Eve gave her the nod.  
  
  “Officer, I’m passing you to the primary in charge. Lieutenant Dallas.”  
  
  Eve took the comm. “Get to the residence. If there’s no response, you have probable cause to enter.”  
  
  “‘Probable cause’?” Salazar said as Eve passed the comm back.  
  
  “Eleven dead, nine wounded, and a missing wife and daughter. That’s more than probable for me. I’ll let you get back to what you do. I’ll start doing what I do.”  
  
  Eve walked to the doorway. “Peabody!”  
  
  Her partner hustled down the ruined corridor in pink cowboy boots. “This is ours. Treat it as a homicide until it looks otherwise. Bomber, deceased, was Paul Rogan—do a run. Officers are en route to his residence to locate his wife and daughter—neither of which is where they should be this morning.”  
  
  “Devoted family man.” As she looked into the conference room, Peabody blew out a breath. “According to one of the wits who survived that. A Sandy Plank, another VP, minor injuries, treated on-site. Hardworking, loyal, smart, and crazy in love with his wife and daughter, is how she describes Rogan.”  
  
  “The loyal don’t generally blow up their boss and coworkers,” Eve pointed out.  
  
  “Yeah. She’s a mess—Plank, I mean. She states he didn’t look well, and she heard him mumbling to himself. She thought he said: There needs to be or has to be another way. And when his boss and Willimina Karson—head of EconoLift—came into the meeting, Rogan walked over to them. Plank said she was watching Rogan because she thought he must have been feeling ill. She heard him say he didn’t have a choice. He said he was sorry. He was, according to her, crying. Then he opened his suit jacket. Boom.”  
  
  “Run him, and let’s find out what this meeting was about. Details. Any idea where his office is?”  
  
  “Down and left, second right. Salazar put a man on the door.”  
  
  “I’ll take it.” She started down, stopped. “Pearson, deceased, was top dog. Let’s find out who’s top dog now.”  
  
  Eve made her way to Rogan’s office, badged the officer on the door. Inside she closed the door, stood, scanned.  
  
  Big window due to VP status, she mused, and a refreshment station with AutoChef. Curious, she checked the AC for previous orders.  
  
  Nothing since Friday at 16:22. A tube of ginger ale.  
  
  The desk was angled, giving Rogan the window and the door view. A good desk chair, two sturdy visitors’ chairs, club style in a smooth coffee-brown leather. A sofa—navy-blue gel—with a long table. Walls, light brown decorated with aeronautic art.  
  
  An evolution of air travel, she realized—from those early deals that made Eve wonder how anyone had had the balls to jump into, up to sleek shuttles. With them, a child’s drawing in bright primary colors of a plane flying in a sky with white clouds and a yellow circle of sun.  
  
  The artist had signed it in careful block letters. MELODY.  
  
  The daughter. Devoted family man, Eve thought, who framed his kid’s drawing and hung it on his office wall.  
  
  On the desk in addition to a top-grade data and communication center, a brightly painted cup held a bouquet of paper flowers, all clearly handmade. Eve lifted the cup, looked at the bottom.  
  
  HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DADDY  
  
  LOVE,  
  
  MELODY  
  
  JANUARY 18, 2061  
  
  The desk held a triple frame, an attractive mixed-race female, late thirties, and a seriously beautiful girl—Melody, no doubt—with mad toffee-colored curls, laughing eyes of pale green, and a joyful smile that showed the gap where she’d lost a couple of baby teeth. They flanked one of the family, the child cuddled between Rogan and his wife.  
  
  The visual said happy, loving, attractive family.  
  
  If there’d been problems on the home front, it didn’t show here.  
  
  She sat behind his desk.  
  
  “Computer, open ops.”  
  
  It fluttered on to a holding screen. Password required . . .  
  
  Ignoring that for now, she opened desk drawers. Standard office supplies, some file discs, some hard copy files. And a memo book.  
  
  She switched it on and, as it wasn’t password protected, paged to the current date.  
  
  ECON! Meeting/signing\* 9:00. Final presentation and reveal. Don’t sweat it!  
  
  Confirm cupcakes and champagne for department thank-you by 11:30. Send department memo for meeting (surprise party). Set for 4:15. Prepared remarks—brief.  
  
  Personal bonuses for Rudy and Kimmi for job amazingly well done.  
  
  Home by 6:00—stop for flowers for your amazing girls! Act surprised at the celebration dinner those amazing girls have been whispering about for a week. One hour post-dinner to resume Dragon Spear tourney with Mel—too long postponed. Tuck Mel into bed, and make love to your beautiful wife—way too long postponed.  
  
  Get some damn sleep!  
  
  Eve sat back, swiveled to look out the window. Why would a man so obviously looking forward to a day—business and personal—blow it all up, himself included?  
  
  She paged ahead, noted several appointments—again business and personal—in that same easy stream-of-thought style. She p  
aged back, found several weeks of an intense work schedule, much of which revolved around Econo strategy sessions, planning sessions, marketing campaigns—aside apologies to his amazing girls for missing dinner or dance practice.  
  
  Nothing to indicate depression, anger—frustration here and there, yes, but not anger. Nothing to indicate he’d bought or acquired explosives or had the knowledge to create a suicide vest.  
  
  “Doesn’t fit,” she muttered, looking at the triple frame photos. “You don’t fit.”  
  
  As she pulled out her comm, Peabody gave the door two knuckle raps, then poked in.  
  
  “Pearson—son and daughter—will probably cohead the company. Son was in London handling that area, and daughter in Rome when things went boom. Both are on their way back. As for Paul Rogan—”  
  
  “Clean as they come?” Eve finished.  
  
  “You got that. Financially secure—no signs of trouble there. Nothing to show any knowledge or interest in explosives, in political fringe associations. Company man, in charge of marketing for the last three and a half years. Worked his way up with over eleven years in the company. The same goes for the wife. I ran her. Actually, she had an assault charge brought when she was in her twenties—dropped. And the guy who brought the charge was subsequently charged with spousal and child abuse.”  
  
  “Okay, it doesn’t add up.” Eve reached for her comm again, and it signaled in her hand. “Dallas.”  
  
  “Lieutenant, Officers Gregg and Vols. We’re at the Rogan/Greenspan residence. Greenspan’s been worked over, and was bound, locked in a basement storage room. The minor child’s unharmed except for some bruises and minor lacerations. We called the MTs for the woman. Both she and the kid claim home invasion.”  
  
  “That adds up. Secure the scene. If the MTs need to take Greenspan to a med center, one of you goes with her, one sits on the residence. I’m on my way.  
  
  “Peabody,” she said as she clicked off. “Inform Salazar of the situation, and contact EDD. I want all Rogan’s e’s—office and home—taken in. I want an e-man at the residence to go over security. I’ll seal this office and get a team in here. Move. Meet me at the car.  She bagged the memo book, sealed and labeled it as she contacted her bullpen.  
  
  “Yo, LT,” Detective Baxter said.  
  
  “Are you and Trueheart clear?”  
  
  “Clear enough. What do you need?”  
  
  “I need you at Quantum Air, coordinating with Lieutenant Salazar.”  
  
  “On the boomer.”  
  
  She sealed the office as she barked out orders.  
  
  “Bring a couple of uniforms. Peabody started getting statements. You finish. Everybody, down to the cleaning service. Two honchos are coming in—family of CEO. I’m going to want to talk to them as soon as possible.”  
  
  “How many dead?” Baxter asked.  
  
  “Eleven, so far. Nine injured.”  
  
  “It could’ve been worse. I’ll contact Salazar, let her know we’re coming in. Are you on scene?”  
  
  “I won’t be. I’ve got a second crime scene. I’ll brief you when I know more. Dallas, out.”  
  
  It could’ve been worse. Baxter said it, she’d thought it. The thing was, when things could be worse, they usually got there.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Eve beat Peabody to the car, and peeled out of the slot the minute Peabody hopped in. She wove through the underground lot at a speed that had her partner gripping the chicken stick.  
  
  “You said it added up.” Peabody’s eyes, dark brown and widening at every swerve, closed to spare her brain the visual of a crash. “I’m putting some of the numbers in columns. Somebody broke into Rogan’s house, threatened his wife and kid, and forced him to kill himself? I don’t get the two-plus-two.”  
  
  “Somebody says take this boom vest to work Monday morning, strap it on and wear it to the meeting at nine. Blow it up. Do that, or we kill your amazing girls.”  
  
  “His amazing girls?”  
  
  “That’s what he called his wife and kid. In his memo book. I don’t know why this guy, why this meeting, why this company, or why this method, but that part adds up.”  
  
  “Wit statements say he was alone in his office, at least for a few minutes before the meeting. He doesn’t call for help?”  
  
  “Could’ve had him wired. I would have. Let him hear the wife getting slapped around, or the kid crying for her daddy.”  
  
  “That’s unbelievably cruel.”  
  
  “Nothing cruel’s unbelievable.” She arrowed out of the underground, zipped into traffic. “Why the marketing guy? They needed somebody who’d not only kill for his wife and kid, but die for them. But how did they know he would? We need to know more about this Quantum-Econo deal. Was the deal the thing? Was there something about it that made someone willing to kill—to use what appears to be an innocent man and his family as the weapon?”  
  
  “I use Econo a lot,” Peabody said. “Or did before I had a mag partner with a magalish husband who lets me use Roarke’s private shuttles.”  
  
  She’d used Econo herself, Eve thought, before Roarke. They were as bare as bare bones got, and therefore affordable if you had to use air travel. She wondered if Roarke had ever used them, before becoming one of the richest men in the known universe—and one who had his own transpo lines as well.  
  
  She’d tap that source, she thought, that expert consultant, civilian. If anybody knew the ins and outs of the QuantumAir-EconoLift deal outside of the particulars in the deal, it would be Roarke.  
  
  She swung in behind the mobile medical unit. Since it was already double-parked, horns and curses were already blasting anyway.  
  
  As she stepped out, the Rapid Cab driver behind her laid on his horn, stuck his head out of the window. “Gimme a fucking break, girlie!”  
  
  Eve held up her badge, smiled with all the warmth of the early March wind. “Lieutenant Girlie. What would you like me to break?”  
  
  He steered around her, shooting her his middle finger on the way.  
  
  “You know Charles and Louise live just down the block,” Peabody commented.  
  
  “Yeah.” The doctor and the former licensed companion had an elegant brownstone within easy walking distance. “Nice neighborhood.”  
  
  Upper class, Eve thought. Reasonably quiet and safe. Brownstones and townhomes tucked back from the sidewalk, often with little front gardens or paved rear courtyards.  
  
  This one had a front garden—dormant now, but neat—with a walkway leading to a short set of stairs, a pair of bold blue double doors. One of the doors hung crookedly.  
  
  The house rose up three stories—decorative (and she’d wager effective) bars on the lower windows. All the privacy screens were engaged but for one on the second floor. Someone had broken that window. She noted the shards of glass and some sort of good-size ball, cracked, in shades of red and orange and brown.  
  
  “I think maybe that’s Jupiter.” Peabody frowned at the ball, tipping her head back to look up at the window.  
  
  Eve avoided the shards, studied the security as they approached the doors. “It’s one of Roarke’s systems, so it’s good. Palm plate, voice ID, solid locks and alarm, double cameras.”  
  
  The door opened. “Lieutenant. Officer Vols.”  
  
  “Status.”  
  
  “Sir. Officer Gregg and I arrived, rang and knocked. Automated security engaged. The comp said no one was currently in residence. Before we attempted a bypass, Gregg stepped down to check windows, go around to the back. And the ball back there? Planet Jupiter?”  
  
  “I knew it,” Peabody said with quick triumph, before Eve shut her down with a cold stare.  
  
  “Well, it nearly beaned Gregg. And the kid who managed to throw it through the window started screaming for help. Gregg called up to her, told her we were the police. She said she couldn’t get out of her room.  
  
  “We couldn’t get through security, LT, had to use the battering ram.”  
  
  “Did the alarm go off?”  
  
  “No, sir, it didn’t. Disengaged. We found the kid upstairs—holding on to herself pretty well. She said they’d hurt her mom, and had taken her away. They’d taken her dad away. Then we heard the pipes. The mother managed to bang on the pipes in the basement room. We found her down there, beat up, tied up. The kid fell apart a little then.”  
  
  A ripple of emotion ran over his stony cop’s face. “She’d thought they’d killed her mom. Two men, they both state, broke into the house sometime in the early hours of Saturday after all three were in bed. From what the wife said, it sounds like they may have drugged the husband while he slept, taken him out that way, then they dragged the wife out of bed, smacked her around a little, tied her up, hauled the kid in. Tied her and the father up.”  
  
  “Did you get a description?”  
  
  “Masks. Both say white, featureless masks. Hoods, gloves. They both say male going by voice and build, but they can’t give us race, facial features, hair or eye color. I’ll tell you, we didn’t push too hard, Lieutenant. The mother needed medical attention, and the kid . . . She holds it together, like I said, but she’s pretty shaken up. We haven’t given Greenspan notification on Rogan. She and the kid asked about him, but we didn’t want to step in it on that.”  
  
  “Okay. You and Gregg stand by. I’ve got an e-man coming to evaluate the security breach and pick up all electronics. Where do you have them?”  
  
  “There’s a family area in the back of the house, off the kitchen. Gregg’s sitting on them.”  
  
  The two MTs walked out from the rear of the house, equipment in hand. “She won’t go to the hospital,” one of them announced. “The adult female. The minor’s mostly just shaken up, but the adult female could use the hospital.”  
  
  “What’s her status?”  
  
  “Two cracked ribs, bruised kidney, sprained wrist, deep lacerations on both wrists and ankles from fighting against the zip ties, broken nose, severe facial and torso bruising, and lacerations from repeated blows. She was dehydrated, suffered a mild concussion.”  
  
  “We’ll see what we can do about getting her to agree to the hospital.”  
  
  The other MT shook his head. “Won’t budge. Wouldn’t take a tranq, either. We’ve got her splinted, wanded, stabilized, but she needs to go in.”  
  
  �  
��Got it,” Eve said as the MTs walked out.  
  
  “She’s afraid to be a foot away from the kid,” Vols told Eve. “Like the kid’s afraid to be a foot away from the mom. You can’t blame them.”  
  
  “Yeah. I got that, too. Good work, Officer.”  
  
  With Peabody, Eve started back to tell a woman her husband was dead, and a child her father wouldn’t be coming home again.  
  
  2  
  
  The kid sat, hollow-eyed, glued to her mother’s side on a wide sofa covered with big, bold red flowers. She wore baggy cotton pants, thick pink socks, a purple sweatshirt. The bruises on her wrists added more purple.  
  
  Her mother kept a protective arm wrapped around her.  
  
  Bruises rioted over Cecily’s face. Eve noted the swelling and blackened rays at the edges of the ice patch on her left eye.  
  
  NuSkin bandages wrapped around both of her wrists. Violet-and-yellow bruises spread around her unpatched right eye.  
  
  When she shifted, the flicker over her face told Eve there was still considerable pain.  
  
  “Ms. Greenspan, I’m Lieutenant Dallas. This is Detective Peabody. We have some questions. We can speak to you at the health center of your choice, as the medics who treated you strongly recommend further examination and treatment.”  
  
  “The MTs treated us here. We want to be home.” She looked down at her daughter who cuddled a little closer, nodded. “No one will tell us about Paul, about my husband, Melody’s father. We’ll answer all your questions, but you have to answer one first. Where is Paul?”  
  
  Eve sat. Eye-to-eye was better, though there was never a better. “I regret to inform you, your husband’s dead. We’re very sorry for your loss.”  
  
  The girl stared at Eve for a long, trembling moment, then pressed her face to her mother’s side. She made a sound like a small animal in terrible pain.  
  
  Cecily turned to gather her daughter in, and the pain, all the levels of it drained her face of color until the bruises stood out like banners.  
  
  “Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you—”  
  
  “Yes. I’m sorry, but we’re sure.”  
  
  “Is there someone we can call for you?” Peabody asked. “Can I get you something? Water, some tea?”  
  
  “How? How?”  
  
  “Detective Peabody can take Melody into another room,” Eve began, and Melody pushed away from her mother, aimed a ferocious look at Eve.  
  
  “I’m not leaving my mom. They made me leave her, and they kept hurting her and Daddy. I’m not going to leave. They made him do something awful. They made him because they kept hurting Mom and said how they’d do things to me. One of them had a knife and told Daddy he’d cut me, and he pulled my hair really hard to make me yell. I tried not to, I tried, but it hurt.”  
  
  “It’s okay, Melly, It’s okay, my baby.”  
  
  “They killed Daddy, and he didn’t do anything. They hurt Mom and she didn’t do anything.”  
  
  “Neither did you,” Eve said. “Did they do anything else to hurt you?”  
  
  “They put the plastic tie things on my wrist and my feet, really tight. They hurt. When the one took Daddy away, the other came in and . . . he made the ties looser so they didn’t hurt so much. But he said if I didn’t yell for Daddy to help me in the ’link, he’d kill Mom.”  
  
  “Oh, Melly, oh baby.”  
  
  “I had to do it. I had to. And I could hear Daddy crying. He was crying, but he said it would be okay. It’s not okay. They killed Daddy.”  
  
  “Tell us what happened,” Eve said to Cecily, “from the beginning.”  
  
  “I heard Melly scream. We were all in bed. I don’t know what time exactly, late Friday night, early Saturday morning. I know it was after midnight because Paul and I didn’t go to bed until about midnight. I heard her scream, and I started to get up and run to her room. Something hit me. Someone.”  
  
  She touched a hand to her face.  
  
  “I fell, and he pulled my arms behind me, used the zip ties. I called for Paul, but he dragged me back to the bed, hit me again and bound me to the headboard. I could see that Paul was still sleeping—at first I thought he was somehow sleeping through it, but I realized they’d used something—a pressure syringe. He was unconscious, helpless. The other one came in with Melly, bound her to the chair.  
  
  “I kept asking what they wanted, begged them not to hurt my baby, told them to take whatever they wanted. They didn’t say anything, didn’t speak. They dragged Paul to the other chair. They tied him, then used another syringe. It brought him around. He tried to fight, but . . .”  
  
  “They hurt Mom again. They kept hurting Mom.”  
  
  “I’m all right now, Melly. I’m okay now. They hurt me, threatened to hurt Melly to torture Paul. They laughed when he cursed them, threatened them, begged them. They just laughed. Then one sat on the side of the bed, beside me—touched me.”  
  
  Cecily’s eyes met Eve’s, said all.  
  
  “He said it would get worse, a lot worse. And did Paul want to save his wife and child? Did he want to protect them? Would he do anything to save them? Of course Paul said yes. He said he’d do anything.”  
  
  “They took me away, even though Mom and Daddy begged,” Melody said. “One of them carried me into my room and used another of the zip things to tie me to my bed so I couldn’t get up. I was scared, and I kept calling for Mom and Daddy, but the one who locked me in, before he did, he said everything was going to be okay. He told me not to be scared, but to stop calling for my mom and dad. So I stopped calling for them. He wanted me to, so I stopped.”  
  
  “You’re smart and you’re brave,” Peabody told her.  
  
  “They still killed Daddy.”  
  
  “Daddy saved us,” Cecily murmured as she pressed her lips to her daughter’s hair. “The one sitting on the bed told Paul he had to do one thing to save his wife and child. One thing, and they’d leave us alone. If he didn’t do what they said, they’d keep hurting me, they’d . . . violate me, and then they’d start on Melody. If he still wouldn’t do it, they’d kill all of us, him last so he could watch them kill his wife and child. They kept saying that—or the one did—wife and child.”  
  
  “What did they say he had to do?”  
  
  “Kill. Take lives to save lives. His wife and child, didn’t they mean more to him than anyone else? Paul said he would but he was lying, and they knew it. The one said he needed more time, more persuasion to make the deal. Then he advised me to convince my husband to save me and my child. They left us alone. I don’t know how long.”  
  
  “They left you and your husband alone in the bedroom?”  
  
  “Yes. Paul tried to get free. I tried. He kept asking if I was all right, telling me he’d find a way. We told each other we loved each other. He swore he’d never let anything happen to Melly.”  
  
  Cecily shuddered, took a moment to try to regulate her breathing that had gone ragged. “I think they had a recorder in the room because the one, when he came back in, mocked some of what we’d said to each other.  
  
  “It went on and on and on. One would come in, hit me or touch me. Then do something to make Melody call out. Ask Paul if he’d do anything to save his wife and child. Hours. Hours and hours. Then they dragged me out. I fought, and one of them hit me and knocked me out, I think. They took me to the basement, locked me up, but they put up a camera. I think they wanted Paul to see me, locked in, cold and hurt, afraid. I was so afraid. I never saw them again. I never saw Paul again.”  
  
  Tears streamed down her face, a river of grief, as she rocked her daughter, stroked Melody’s hair.  
  
  “I was alone down there until the police came. Now I know Paul did what they asked. He did what they asked to save us. They tortured a good man, a good husband and father, until he did what they asked.”  
  
  Turning, Cecily tipped Melody’s face up to hers. “Don’t ever forget that. Whatever Daddy did, whatever people say about him, he loved you more than anything in the world. He did what he had to do to protect us, to save us.”  
  
  “They made him wear a bomb.”  
  
  Cecily jerked back. “What? How do you—”  
  
/>   “Ms. Greenspan,” Eve interrupted. Focusing on Melody, she asked, “You saw the explosives?”  
  
  “No, but I heard them talking. One came in, and I pretended to be asleep. It was dark in the room—they kept it dark a lot, but it was dark outside, too, and I pretended to be asleep. And the other one came, like, to the door. They talked about the bombs, and the one—the one that hurt Mom, he said how my daddy would wear it, how he was almost there, how he’d do what they said.”  
  
  “Do you remember anything else they said?”  
  
  “They were talking really quiet, but I guess, like, they were really excited, too. I don’t know how to say it.”  
  
  “I get it. Anything else?”  
  
  “They were going to Fat City.”  
  
  “Fat City?”  
  
  “They’d be in Fat City at nine. And the one who came in my room most of the time came over and sort of nudged me. I just sort of rolled over and kept pretending I was asleep. He said he was glad I was getting some sleep. And the other said . . .”  
  
  She looked at her mother, tipped her head to her mother’s arm. “He said the bad word that starts with ‘f.’ The bad ‘f’ word and ‘the kid.’ And they went out. Then I did fall asleep, I think, because it got light out. The one that mostly came in let me get up and pee. It’s embarrassing. Then he put the tie things on my wrists again, and I had to get back on the bed. But he got tagged on his ’link, and he got excited and said the bad word again, a lot, but excited, not mad, and he walked out, still talking—he locked the door.”  
  
  Melody took a long breath. “He didn’t come back. Everything got really quiet. I almost fell back to sleep, or maybe I did, but then I saw he hadn’t tied up my feet again, or tied me to the bed like before. He was excited. He forgot maybe. So I tried to get out, but I couldn’t get the door open. I couldn’t get the windows open. I yelled, but nobody could hear me. I saw Mr. Benson across the street going out of his house, and I yelled and tried to bang on the windows but he didn’t look up. And I saw the police, and they came to the door, but nobody was going to answer. I saw my solar system, and I knocked Jupiter off, and I picked it up. I dropped it at first because it was hard to hold it, but then I threw it as hard as I could at the window. It broke the window, and I yelled and yelled for help. And the police came in.

  Aerie adjusted the top of the maroon tankini she was modeling, tugging it lower and assuming a different pose in the sand. ""No kidding,"" she murmured back. ""He's giving me the heebie-jeebies.""  
  
  We were on location in the Caribbean doing a shoot for a fashion manufacturer that was poised to become a very big deal. It had been a last minute job, the girls originally booked for the shoot having canceled at the last minute. We'd almost declined, but our agent, Lacy, and our manager--who was our mom--had insisted it would be great for our career. We were already reaching the top of the profession, and Lacy said this job would seal the deal. We decided we would put a vacation on hold for a little while longer and, besides, wouldn't a job in the Caribbean be sort of like a vacation?  
  
  So, here we were on a beautiful beach, with a crew of people looking after our every need, yet both of us could hardly wait to take a shower--and it wasn't because of the heat, sand, and makeup.  
  
  I was wearing the same bathing suit as Aerie, although mine was a deep indigo color. The suits were part of a sleek new tankini line made by one of our Instagram sponsors, who was a new designer getting a lot of buzz.  
  
  I shifted my pose slightly, drawing my left thigh up and leaning against Aerie. The photographer, who went by the name of Ulf, was a middle-aged man with a paunch he was desperately trying to hide along with the bald spot on the back of his head which did nothing for his skinny little manbun. He dropped to his knees in the sand, shimmied forward, closer to Aerie and me, angling his camera just so, snapping a dozen photographs in rapid succession before checking them. His two assistants stood by to hold reflectors and provide whichever camera or lens was needed.  
  
  ""Very good, very good,"" Ulf cooed. ""Now, Aerie, I think you should sit up and play with your hair. Tate, go to your belly and look backwards at me.""  
  
  Ulf watched--a little too closely, if you ask me--as Aerie and I assumed the poses he'd suggested. His eyes followed our every movement, whether through the viewfinder of his camera or not, and when we bent or shifted so our assets jiggled, he would adjust himself...and not subtly, either.  
  
  Ulf was the best photographer in the business, our manager insisted, and she told us to just do what he said and get the shoot over with. In other words, deal with Ulf being a sleazy perv. Don't insult him, don't call him out, just let him ogle you and snap his shots--deal with it. Just deal with it.  
  
  Easy for Mom to say, since she was our manager, and all she had to do was arrange our bookings and schmooze her way around the various media events. She wasn't the one being ogled and photographed and leered at, since she was safe and sound in her New York penthouse with our dick of a step-father, Bob.  
  
  We went through at least a dozen different outfits and a dozen different poses for each one, all provocative, with Ulf snapping hundreds and hundreds of photographs. The sun rose higher as the morning wore on and it got hotter and hotter. The glam squad had to constantly dab at the beads of sweat on our foreheads and reapply and retouch, and twist our hair back into the perfect spirals, and keep the flyaways matted down...so yeah, modeling is not easy. It really isn't. It's a hell of a lot more than just getting photographed.  
  
  As usual, we'd been patient and professional, doing all that was asked of us but, finally, my patience was running out.  
  
  ""How many more shots do you need, Ulf?"" I asked. ""We've been here for four hours now.""  
  
  ""We're almost done, my dear, almost done."" He said this to my breasts as I stood up. ""Just a few more poses.""  
  
  He moved over behind me, toying with my hair, twisting the strands just so. And then he bent and scooped up a handful of sand, and smeared it over my butt so it stuck to the sticky layer of sweat. He didn't just smear it on, though. Oh, no. He cupped, and squeezed, and petted, and got all kinds of handsy with me. I know one of his assistants saw it happen as I heard him take in a sharp breath and mutter ""Jesus"" under his breath. He stepped forward to diffuse the situation, but he was too slow.  
  
  Four hours in the hot sun on a Caribbean beach, dealing with the gallery of tourists watching us, sweating, without craft service, without coffee, without so much as fresh bottles of water, working our asses off and then, on top of it all, dealing with this old, overweight, leering asshole...  
  
  I just lost it.  
  
  I danced back out of his reach, twisted around, and socked him square on the jaw. Have I mentioned that Aerie and I train three days a week with the best Krav Maga teacher in New York? So this pretty little model knows how to hit, and hit hard.  
  
  Ulf spun around like a hippo in pointe shoes and hit the sand flat on his back, camera bouncing off his chest. He was out cold.  
  
  ""What now, BITCH?"" I shouted, stepping over him. ""Grab my ass? I don't think so!""  
  
  Aerie was the first to pull me away. ""Tate, calm the hell down.""  
  
  ""Calm down? Calm down? He's been staring at my tits for the last four hours! And now he grabs my ass like he owns it, and you tell me to calm down?""  
  
  Lacy, our agent, stepped quickly but carefully across the sand in her four-inch-heel Louboutins. ""Tate, what in the world has gotten into you?"" she hissed, as she reached me.  
  
  ""He grabbed my ass,"" I huffed. ""And I don't mean a little, like, oops I accidentally copped a feel. It was a full-on grope.""  
  
  ""We talked about this, Tate,"" Lacy said, ice in her voice. ""I told you he can be difficult but he's the best in the business.""  
  
  ""I don't care!"" I shouted. ""That doesn't give him the right to grope me.""  
  
  ""That's debatable, especially if you want to make it to the top. He can blacklist you, and no one will photograph you or Aerie ever again. He has that much influence in this business.""  
  
  Aerie had my arm in a death grip. ""I know it sucks, T, but...""  
  
  I whirled on her. ""Oh, no. No. No. You are not going to turn on me right now, A. You're not. No. You are my twin. He groped me. This isn't dealing with your average sexism, this is goddamned sexual assault.""  
  
  ""Now that's a little overly dramatic,"" Lacy said in her ""let's be reasonable voice"".  
  
  I took two slow, prowling steps toward Lacy, which put me in her personal space. I stared at her, glaring with every last ounce of irate fury I possessed...which at that moment was quite a bit. There aren't  
many people who can stand up to my patented death glare, and Lacy Everett-Perkins is definitely not one of them.  
  
  ""No, Lacy. It's not overly dramatic."" I was speaking in my quiet-and-sharp-as-a-razor voice. ""It's exactly the truth. When a man--any man, famous or important or the best, or just an average dick on the street--puts his hands on my body without my permission, that is sexual assault. Ulf here--"" I gestured at the photographer in question, who was starting to moan as he regained consciousness, ""--touched me without my permission. He's lucky all I did was punch him. If I ever see him again, I'll break his damn arm, Lacy. How's that for melodramatic?""  
  
  ""Tate!"" Aerie hissed, hauling me aside. ""What are you doing? We need this sponsor, which means we need this shoot, which means we need Ulf, like it or not.""  
  
  ""No, Aerie, we don't need Ulf, or the sponsor, or the shoot; they need us. Vela Fashion is nobody. They're nothing right now. Nobody has ever heard of them. We, on the other hand, are among the most well-known Instagram models on the fucking planet. This shoot we're doing for Vela will put them on the map."" I gestured at Ulf, and Lacy. ""I'm not going to take this shit anymore, A. I'm just not. I'm tapped out. I'm done. The last shoot we did, what happened? You remember?""  
  
  She sighed. ""Of course I remember. The photographer propositioned you.""  
  
  ""He didn't just proposition me, A. He offered me five thousand dollars to spend the night with him.""  
  
  ""That's propositioning you.""  
  
  ""That's him thinking I'm a fucking whore!"" My temper was up, and once that happens, there's no calming me until my fury has blown itself out. ""And besides, five grand? Really? I'm not going to whore myself out to a poor, ugly, dumpy-ass middle-aged fucking photographer, for one thing, and I sure as fuck wouldn't do it for any money, never mind a measly five grand. I'm worth a hell of a lot more than that.""  
  
  Aerie sighed. ""Tate, please."" She was trying the sweetness and light routine, which, TBH, was often rather effective in talking me down from a temper tantrum. ""You're right about Ulf being a dirty sleazeball, and you're right about not taking it. I'm with you on this, okay? I swear I am. I've been hit on and propositioned too. You know that. I just..."" She rubbed her forehead with a knuckle. ""I don't want to get blacklisted. I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to give this up just yet.""  
  
  I groaned in irritation, because I hate it when she's right, and I hate it even more when she manages to diffuse my temper. I'll let you in on a little secret: deep down, I really like getting all pissed off. It feels good to let the anger out.  
  
  ""Neither am I,"" I said, ""but I'm not going to take that bullshit from anyone.""  
  
  Ulf was staggering to his feet, rubbing his jaw, and the crew stood around not knowing what to do. I would have put money on the fact that if they'd had to choose sides they wouldn't have sided with him.  
  
  He glared at me. ""You'll never work again, slut. In fact, you two are done in this business.""  
  
  Aerie was the one who stomped over to him. Her hand shot out and clutched his testicles in a vise-like grip, making him go purple in the face, gasping. ""Or how about this, Ulf? You're going to shut your filthy mouth, and you're going to get your nasty ass out of here, and you're not going to say shit to anyone about Tate or me."" Her voice was sweet as sugar, saccharine and honey and sunshine, making her words sting all the harder. ""You know why you're going to do that, Ulf? Because if I hear you've been talking about us, I'm going to rip your teeny-tiny little mouse-man balls off. You got me, Ulf? So take your camera, and your teeny-tiny little mouse-man balls, and just do your fucking job. And, in case you've forgotten, your job is to take pictures, Ulf. You don't get to touch the models. In fact you don't even get to sniff the same air Tate and I breathe, Ulf."" She released his sac, and he staggered backward, gasping, clutching himself, clearly struggling to hold back tears of agony.  
  
  With that she pivoted on her heel and swept past Ulf, the crew, and a stunned, silent Lacy. All she said was, ""Let's go, T.""  
  
  I followed her, trying desperately to suppress my laughter. We walked up the beach, past the tourists who were clapping and giving us a thumbs-up, and made it out of sight of Lacy and Ulf, when I gave in to snickering, giggling hilarity.  
  
  ""Oh my god, A! Teeny-tiny mouse-man balls?"" I collapsed backward against the side of the tiki bar. ""That was epic, seriously epic.""  
  
  She let out a breath and shook her shaking hands, and then laughed with me. ""It was, wasn't it?""  
  
  ""You don't even get to sniff the same air?"" I said, through wheezing gasps of laughter. ""Where did you come up with that shit?""  
  
  ""I don't know! I just lost it.""  
  
  ""I thought I was the one with the hair-trigger temper?""  
  
  She shrugged. ""Nobody calls my sister a slut but me.""  
  
  I sighed. ""Seriously, though, thanks for having my back.""  
  
  ""I've always got your back, you know that."" She peered around the corner, watching Lacy arguing vehemently with an enraged Ulf. ""I think we may have just sunk our career, though.""  
  
  ""Nah. No way. We're too pretty for that.""  
  
  Aerie just rolled her eyes at me. ""Tate, looks can only get us so far. If we develop a reputation for assaulting our photographers, Ulf won't have to blacklist us, we'll do it to ourselves.""  
  
  ""Everyone knows Ulf is a handsy pervert,"" I said. ""He may be the best photographer around which is why people work him in the first place, but everybody knows who he is and what he is. We'll be fine.""  
  
  We slipped into a hotel bar further up the beach and took seats, ordering coffee and breakfast burritos. As we waited for our food, we pulled out our phones and spent a few minutes just sitting quietly--it wouldn't be long before Lacy would come to find us. I eyed my twin. ""So, Aerie, now what?""  
  
  Aerie rolled a shoulder. ""Our dear sweet momager has us in Portland in three days for some kind of festival. And then we're back in Manhattan to shoot for Prada, I think. Or maybe it's Mui Mui. Something like that, I don't remember right now. And then we have that music video thing we're doing in Venice.""  
  
  ""Venice, Italy, or Venice, California?"" I asked.  
  
  ""Um. Italy, I think? I don't know, now that you mention it.""  
  
  I sipped my coffee and looked out at the ocean and thought about the nonstop, itinerary our mother/manager--or, momager, as Aerie called her--had us scheduled for. I felt overwhelmed and exhausted just thinking about it.  
  
  ""I'm thinking, A,"" I said, turning to her.  
  
  She snorted. ""Careful, sis, you might hurt yourself.""  
  
  I threw a creamer at her head. ""Oh, shut up, dweeb."" I leaned forward and grabbed her wrist, directing her attention from her phone and onto me. ""I feel like Mom is overextending us.""  
  
  ""Well, we are busier than ever, that's for sure.""  
  
  ""We're modeling, blogging, auditioning for TV slots, acting in music videos...we never have any downtime, like ever,"" I said, squeezing her wrist. ""We've been on the go, without a single day off, travel time excluded, since we were sixteen. I'm tired, A.""  
  
  Aerie sighed, nodding. ""The only downtime we ever get is traveling from one shoot or audition or event to another. I don't even remember the last time we got to just sit around in sweatpants watching TV.""  
  
  ""We don't even own a TV, and Mom would never let us be caught dead wearing something so pedestrian as sweatpants."" I let go of Aerie's wrist as the server brought us our food, and we were quiet as we dug in. Once I'd taken a few bites, I said, ""My point is, we need a vacation.""  
  
  ""Mom won't let us.""  
  
  ""Is this our career, or Mom's?""  
  
  ""Mom's, obviously,"" Aerie joked. ""When you say vacation, what exactly do you have in mind?""  
  
  I shrugged. ""Something extended, and remote. Something that will allow us to get back to being who we really are--normal girls who watch The Bachelor and attend baby showers and backyard barbecues, girls who don't have to deal with all the unrealistic bullshit of modeling and international travel.""  
  
  ""How about Fiji for a week?"" Aerie offered.  
  
  I shook my head, washing down my breakfast burrito with too-hot coffee. ""I was thinking about something  
more than that. Like...maybe going home, for a month or two, and just getting back to basics...trying to be normal.""  
  
  Aerie paused, I'd obviously surprised her. ""Home? You mean Mom's condo on the upper east side?""  
  
  I shook my head. ""No, Aerie, that's never been home. You know that.""  
  
  She swallowed hard. ""What are you suggesting, T?""  
  
  ""I'm suggesting we take an indefinite leave of absence from our career and hole up in Ketchikan until we're ready to face the world again."" I waved my hand at the beach. ""That, back there? That was the last straw for me. I'm sick of being photographed. I'm sick of being made up and having my hair done and eating like a damn bird and exercising like I'm trying out for the fucking Olympics. I'm even more sick of sleazy photographers, and being hit on, and propositioned, and molested, and talked down to, and treated like I'm nothing but an ornament. I want to eat cheesecake and cheeseburgers, and drink myself into a stupor, and maybe even have sex with someone and actually stick around for coffee the next morning instead of doing the walk of shame from the dude's bed to a photo shoot, smelling like condoms and apathy.""  
  
  Aerie got up and came around the table and just hugged me. ""Oh, honey, I know. I know. Me too. But...Ketchikan?""  
  
  I looked her straight in the eyes. ""Think about it, A! Who the hell would look for us in Alaska? Nobody, that's who. We shut off our phones, literally. No social media, no Insta posts, no Snapping, no Tweeting, no swiping left or right on fucking Tinder, no Reddit AMAs, no Tumblr, none of that bullshit. We can eat what we want, and not wash our hair, and get pimples and fat asses and drink whatever we want and when we feel like going back to work, we can. Mom can't run our career for the rest of our lives. We have to take charge. I'm burnt out, A. I need a break."" I lifted an eyebrow. ""Plus, our twenty-first birthday is coming up soon.""  
  
  She nodded, thinking about it. ""That does sound pretty awesome, now that you put it that way. I like the idea of just dropping out and doing whatever we want. Besides, I think we'd look pretty good with thick asses, actually. We laughed at that image. I was pretty sure we'd have to eat a lot of cheeseburgers before that happened.  
  
  ""You know why else I'm thinking Ketchikan?"" I asked.  
  
  ""I have no idea.""  
  
  I couldn't suppress a giggle. ""Because I was surfing on Facebook the other night, and I came across this fun little page."" I pulled up the page in question and spun my phone around so she could see it--Badd's Bar and Grill, Ketchikan, Alaska.  
  
  She scrolled through it. ""The Badd brothers are all back in Ketchikan?""  
  
  ""All of them.""  
  
  She lifted her gaze to mine. ""All of them, meaning, all of them? Even Canaan and Corin?""  
  
  ""Especially Canaan and Corin,"" I said.  
  
  ""You know..."" Aerie said, pinching to zoom in on a photo of the twins, ""I've always wondered what those boys have been doing over the past few years. I'm surprised they're back in Alaska. I mean, I know they're pretty big in the music business...but Alaska?""  
  
  ""I've wondered the same thing.""  
  
  ""They're hot, successful, moderately famous like us, they're twins, and they were our best friends growing up. It's kind of weird that we've lost touch.""  
  
  ""I know they valued our friendship a lot, even in high school when every girl there was throwing themselves at them. I'm sure they learned everything they know in the sex department thanks to those girls. That's probably why they always kept our friendship totally separate,"" I said.  
  
  ""But we barely see them now, and they're even sexier than they were as teenagers. I have to admit, I'm dying of curiosity. All the girls back in high school always talked about how amazing they were in bed, and that was years ago. I'm sure they've had a lot of practice since then, you know?""  
  
  ""But what if seeing them again is weird?"" I asked.  
  
  ""Oh, it will probably be a little weird at first, but you have to remember we were always best friends growing up. Their brothers always treated us like little sisters,"" Aerie said, putting my phone to sleep and handing it to me.  
  
  ""So we're going back to Ketchikan to reconnect with the Badd twins?""  
  
  Aerie grinned at me. ""Remember, it was your idea to go back to Ketchikan.""  
  
  ""True."" I laugh again. ""I suppose catching up with the boys now they're back in town may or may not have crossed my mind already.""  
  
  ""Catching up, huh?"" Aerie rolled her eyes at me.  
  
  ""Yeah, you know, just...see how things stand.""  
  
  She gave me a meaningful stare. ""I'm definitely curious to see how things stand with Canaan and Corin.""  
  
  ""Which does lead to the question of how things would break down, if you know what I mean,"" I said, eyeing my twin.  
  
  She sighed. ""How we would split up, you mean? Which twin with which twin?""  
  
  ""Exactly.""  
  
  A long pause. ""That...yeah, that could be complicated.""  
  
  ""As kids, it was always you and Corin, and me and Canaan,"" I said.  
  
  ""I know,"" Aerie said with a sigh, ""but what if it's different now? We haven't seen them in a couple years, and we're different and they're probably different, and what if..."" she trailed off uncertainly.  
  
  I finished my coffee. ""I'm curious, though, is my point,"" I said. ""Deeply, intensely curious.""  
  
  ""Me too, T. Me too.""  
  
  Our conversation ended right then, when Lacy found us. She slid into the booth beside me and took off her heels. Her feet must be killing her.  
  
  ""Girls,"" she began, ""you can't just--""  
  
  ""Before you get started, Lacy, I feel like you should be on our side,"" I interrupted. ""And not just because you're...you know...our agent, but because you're a woman. You should totally understand our position. There shouldn't even be a question in your mind.""  
  
  ""I am on your side, but I also have to have your future and career in mind as well.""  
  
  ""You know what's in the best interest of our career?"" I snapped. ""Not being sexually assaulted.""  
  
  ""Oh, stop being dramatic."" Lacy sighed. ""He grabbed your ass, it's not like he tried to rape you.""  
  
  I gaped at Lacy. ""Did you just...did she just..."" I looked over at Aerie, and then back at Lacy. ""You did not just say that.""  
  
  Aerie was frowning at Lacy with an expression of stunned incomprehension. ""That may be true, Lacy, but do you believe men have license to help themselves to whatever they want? Is that what you believe?""  
  
  Lacey quirked an eyebrow. ""It's par for the course in this business. In any business, really. I was in stock futures before I became a talent agent, and I can't even tell you how often I was groped on the floor, or in the hallways or elevators. It sucks, it really does, but men can be pigs, and it's what we women have to deal with to get anywhere in this world. It doesn't make it okay, but you can't go around punching everyone who touches you inappropriately.""  
  
  ""Actually, I can,"" I said. ""And I will. I will punch, kick, knee, bite, gouge, and otherwise physically injure any and every male who touches me without my permission. It is not something I just have to deal with to get anywhere in this world. Your acceptance and complacency makes you complicit, and complicity makes them think it's okay. I guarantee you Ulf won't be putting his hands on me ever again, because I cleaned his clock the first time he did it. And maybe he'll think twice about trying something like that with someone else. Lacy, I'm totally willing to work with him again, as long as he keeps his filthy paws to himself and just does his damn job.""  
  
  Lacy hesitated. ""Yes, well, after this, I'm not sure he'll work with you again. I barely managed to convince him to not press assault charges.""  
  
  ""Have you seen the news lately?"" I laughed. ""Please, please let him press charges. I'll take him to court and I will sue the sleaze out of him. By the time I'm done with him, he'll be a monk.""  
  
  Aerie cut in. ""All this is moot, anyway, Lacy. Tate and I are taking an indefinite leave of absence.""  
  
  Lacy gaped. ""You...what?""  
  
  ""We're taking a very, very long vacation,"" I clarified. ""So long, in fact, that we may not come back.""  
  
  ""But...but..."" Lacy stammered. ""You're booked through next February!""  
  
  ""We will honor our commitments through the end of the month--"" Aerie said.  
  
  ""...and you can cancel the rest,"" I added.  
  
  ""We'll be completely incommunicado. All social media will be deactivated--"" Aerie started.  
  
  ""And our cell phones will be shut off. No email, no calls, no texts,"" I finished.  
  
  ""And that goes for Mom, too. She can find someone else to manage for a while--"" Aerie said.  
  
  ""No forwarding address, either,"" I said. ""Meaning, we're going so far off the grid, even the CIA won't be able to find us.""  
  
  Lacy stared at us, speechless, looking from one of us to the other, trying to absorb what we were saying. We don't do the twin-speak very often, when we alternate like that, but when we do, it really throws people off.  
  
  ""But--but..."" Lacy stammered yet again. ""You can't just...disappear. You'll lose your social relevancy. You'll be finished in the business.""  
  
  ""Modeling was never our dream anyway,"" I said. ""It was just something we fell into because Mom pushed us into it. It's been fun for a while--""  
  
  ""But we're tired of it now, and we need some time to decompress and reassess what we want out of life,"" Aerie said.  
  
  ""Plus, we're sick of eating like dainty little birds. We want cheeseburgers and chocolate cake,"" Aerie added.  
  
  ""And lots of alcohol and sex,"" I continued.  
  
  ""I'm lost,"" Lacy said. ""Does your mom know about this?"" She said this with a bit of trepidation in her voice.  
  
  We knew Lacy was scared of Rachel Kingsley--like just about everyone else in the business--and we knew she would definitely not want to be the one to tell her about our new plans.  
  
  Aerie patted Lacy's hand. ""Just relax and don't worry. We'll take care of letting mom know about our decision.""  
  
  ""So--so...when does this indefinite leave of absence start?"" Lacy asked, clearly mollified.  
  
  Aerie and I traded glances. ""We'll do Portland, Manhattan, and the music video in Venice, and then we're done,"" Aerie said.  
  
  ""Speaking of Venice, is t  
hat Venice, Italy or Venice, California?"" I asked.  
  
  Lacy had her phone out and was typing furiously. ""Italy, obviously. It's a shoot for Gucci.""  
  
  ""Ooh, Gucci,"" Aerie cooed. ""I love Gucci. Will we get freebies?""  
  
  ""No, you don't get freebies,"" Lacy snapped. ""You do the shoot and you get paid in U.S. dollars like everyone else.""  
  
  ""I'm just saying, I'd work for free if we got to keep the wardrobe,"" Aerie said.  
  
  I lifted my hand. ""I'll take the dollars, if it's all the same.""  
  
  Lacy just sighed. ""I'll see what I can do.""  
  
  She shot a look at me and then Aerie. ""Now, I have to ask--when do you plan to let your mom know about this?""  
  
  ""Not immediately,"" Aerie replied, ""but we'll let her know before we get back from Italy.""  
  
  Lacy winced. ""Your mom is not going to be happy.""  
  
  ""Too bad!"" Aerie and I chorused together.  
  
  ""Well, if you don't mind, I have to excuse myself and start calling your sponsors and coming up with explanations and apologies. We'll stay in touch over the next month. Meantime, you two need to be on a plane tomorrow morning, which means you have the rest of today to yourselves."" She glared at me. ""Try not to maim anyone else, Tate.""  
  
  I shrugged. ""I'm not making any promises.""  
  
  Later that evening, in our hotel room, Aerie and I were at the fun end of a couple of bottles of wine, which we'd scored thanks to Lacy's assistant.  
  
  ""Do you want to Skype the boys and let them know we're coming to Ketchikan?"" Aerie asked, apropos of nothing.  
  
  I frowned at her. ""Right now?""  
  
  She giggled. ""Yeah, right now. I don't think they'll mind.""  
  
  I bit my lip, thinking. ""It has been a while since we Skyped with them.""  
  
  ""We should tell them we're coming back. See how they react.""  
  
  I nodded and went across the room to get my laptop. ""Very true, A, very true.""  
  
  I opened Skype and dialed the boys.  
  
  Aerie scooted beside me as the camera popped up to show us on the screen. She finger-combed her long blonde hair, twisting strands aside and plumping the rest for added volume as the line trilled.  
  
  We're identical twins, so we both have naturally platinum blonde hair and eyes that are a dramatically vivid amber, with streaky hints of green around the rims. Having been moonlighting as models for the last few years, we were playing up the identical twins look, keeping our hair the same length and often dressing in matching or very similar outfits for shoots. In our private lives, though, we were very different. Aerie liked her hair down around her shoulders, with loose spiraling curls, while I preferred to keep mine either braided or in a high and tight ponytail; Aerie went for dark, dramatic smoky looks with makeup, while I liked to stay more natural and subtle, usually just a little blush and concealer and eyeliner.  
  
  If we did our makeup and hair exactly the same, though, it would be nearly impossible to tell us apart unless you knew us both very, very well, and even our own mother had difficulty keeping us separate if we were done up to look identical.  
  
  The line was still trilling, but unless they'd changed completely, Cane and Cor were never far from a device of some kind, just like Aerie and me.  
  
  Finally, after a solid two minutes of ringing and re-dialing, the trilling ended and the screen changed to show Canaan and Corin.  
  
  And...holy mother of Moses, those boys were hot to begin with. But now? They were incredibly sexy. They were shirtless, sweaty, and breathing hard.  
  
  Having known them their whole lives, it was easy enough to immediately identify who was who, even if they did wear their hair differently. Canaan had long hair, rock star long, past his shoulders, a deep, rich brown, while Corin had the sides of his head shaved, with the top left long enough that he could tie it into a tiny little topknot/manbun thing. Which, typically, were stupid and lame, and I hated them, but on Corin, it just...worked. They both had full sleeve tattoos from shoulder to wrist, bright color montages of jumbled imagery. They were into piercings and had rings through the center of their lower lip, and Canaan had another through his septum, while Corin had a stud in his tongue--visible when he licked his lips--and they both had multiple small hoops and studs in their ears, several each in their earlobes and more around the upper curve.  
  
  All in all, they looked like the kickass rock stars they were.  
  
  They were also ridiculously shredded. Like, CrossFit shredded. Mouthwatering, thigh quivering, pussy dampening shredded. Speaking for myself, at least, one look at them all sweaty and jacked and breathing hard, covered in tattoos and piercings and my thighs were absolutely doing the quivery cha-cha, and heat was very definitely pooling between them, leaving me squirming and turned on.  
  
  And we hadn't even said hello yet. Live and in person? Oh boy. I'd be all over those boys like white on rice.  
  
  ""T and A!"" Canaan said, using their pet name for us. ""It's been way too long. What are you girls up to?""  
  
  ""Sitting in our hotel room in Jamaica, drinking wine after a really shitty shoot,"" I answered. ""What about you boys?""  
  
  ""Finishing a workout,"" Corin said, wiping his forehead. ""Which is why we're all sweaty and out of breath.""  
  
  I winked. ""Hey, I'm not complaining.""  
  
  Canaan and Corin exchanged glances. ""Why was the shoot so shitty?"" Corin asked.  
  
  ""The photographer turned out to be super sleazy, and then our agent was spectacularly unhelpful when we complained about his behavior. And, as usual, our mother completely overextended our schedule so we're flying to Italy in the morning."" I leaned forward to adjust the screen and Corin's eyes flicked downward. I pretended not to notice, of course, but I was pretty sure he was getting an eyeful.  
  
  ""If your agent is unhelpful,"" Canaan said, ""then why don't you fire her?""  
  
  I shrugged. ""It's not that simple.""  
  
  Corin frowned. ""I mean, it kind of is. We went through three agents before we settled on Dan. They work for you, not the other way around.""  
  
  I laughed, glancing at Aerie. ""He has a point, A.""  
  
  We giggled simultaneously, and then tried to resume straight faces. ""We may have gone one better than firing our agent, though,"" I said.  
  
  The boys did the thing where they both quirked one eyebrow in unison, which always made my heart pitter patter a little harder.  
  
  ""And that would be--"" Canaan started.  
  
  ""What exactly?"" Corin finished.  
  
  ""We just decided today that we're tired of being international Instagram models,"" Aerie said.  
  
  ""So we're taking an indefinite leave of absence,"" I continued.  
  
  ""And since we don't want to be found or bothered during our leave of absence, we've decided we're going to go completely off the grid."" Aerie grinned at me, and then at the boys on the screen.  
  
  Corin: ""Off the grid--""  
  
  Canaan: ""Meaning what?""  
  
  ""We're moving back to Ketchikan,"" Aerie and I said together.  
  
  Canaan and Corin locked gazes for a moment, exchanging silent communication.  
  
  ""Oh really?"" Corin drawled.  
  
  ""You're moving back, not just visiting?"" Canaan asked.  
  
  I shrugged, and I didn't miss the way Corin's eyes followed the movement of my breasts with the shrug. ""Probably not permanently forever and ever,"" I said, ""but for a while. Until we figure out our next move.""  
  
  ""So you're quitting modeling?"" Canaan asked.  
  
  ""We haven't decided anything for sure,"" Aerie said.  
  
  ""All we know is we need a break, and not just a couple days on a beach drinking Mai Thais and ogling the surfers,"" I said.  
  
  ""When will you be in town?"" Corin asked.  
  
  ""Beginning of next month,"" I answered.  
  
  ""We're honoring the next few bookings we've got this month, simply out of professionalism,"" Aerie added.  
  
  The boys were silent again, wordlessly exchanging something or other.  
  
  ""Do you have somewhere to stay?"" Canaan asked.  
  
  ""Why?"" I said, somewhat coyly. ""Are you offering your place?""  
  
  ""Tate!"" Aerie said, laughing and elbowing me in the ribs. ""Forward, much? Jesus.  
""  
  
  I shrugged again, because I liked the way Corin's eyes seemed glued to my chest when I did it. ""What? Just asking.""  
  
  Corin finally managed to pull his eyes back up to my face. ""If we had extra space or anything like privacy, I'd offer it up in a heartbeat,"" he said. ""But, alas, we're sharing a three-bedroom apartment with Bax, Brock and his girlfriend, and Lucian.""  
  
  ""So unless you're down with sharing beds..."" Canaan suggested, watching both of us for our responses.  
  
  Aerie and I exchanged looks.  
  
  ""We're not sure where we're staying,"" I said, carefully phrasing my response so it was neither a refusal nor an outright admission of interest.  
  
  ""Brock Badd has a girlfriend?"" Aerie said, sounding stunned. ""Like, a real girlfriend?""  
  
  ""Pretty sure she's not a robot, so yes,"" Corin answered, chuckling.  
  
  ""But I mean, she's really his girlfriend with, like, commitment and everything?"" Aerie clarified.  
  
  ""Color us stunned too,"" Canaan said.  
  
  ""I suppose you may as well be forewarned,"" Corin said. ""Love is in the air in Ketchikan, Alaska.""  
  
  ""What does that mean?"" I asked.  
  
  ""It means Bast is married, Zane and his woman just had a baby, Brock is engaged or something like that, Bax is complicated..."" Corin responded. ""Love is in the air, I'm telling you.""  
  
  ""Maybe we should rethink our plans then, A,"" I joked.  
  
  Corin's eyes went wide, and Canaan elbowed him hard enough to elicit a grunt of surprised pain. ""Good job, asshole. Now they're not coming.""  
  
  ""That was a joke,"" I said, a little too quickly. ""We're still coming. We wanted to go somewhere as far away from New York as possible, and Ketchikan is certainly that.""  
  
  ""But what about you two?"" Aerie asked. ""Is love in the air for you as well?""  
  
  ""Not yet,"" Corin said. ""But, then, you guys haven't arrived yet.""  
  
  Canaan spluttered, going red in the face and elbowing Corin even harder than before. ""What the fuck is wrong with you, Cor? Jesus! Shut the fuck up!""  
  
  Corin just smirked. ""That was a joke.""  
  
  Corin and I exchanged amused glances, while Canaan and Aerie both huffed and rolled their eyes.  
  
  ""You guys are both ridiculous,"" Canaan said to Corin and me.  
  
  ""Filtering what you say is a basic skill of adulthood,"" Aerie added.  
  
  ""Fuck that."" I laughed. ""I refuse to filter myself. People can deal with the truth, or they can go fuck themselves.""  
  
  ""Fuckin' A!"" Corin said.

  Rule  
  
  At first I thought the pounding in my head was my brain trying to fight its way out of my skull after the ten or so shots of Crown Royal I had downed last night, but then I remembered that it was Sunday and no matter how many times I told her, or how rude, or whatever kind of debauched and unsavory condition she found me in she showed up on Sunday morning to drag me home for brunch. A soft moan from the other side of the bed reminded me that I hadn’t come home from the bar last night alone, not that I remembered the girl’s name or what she looked like or if had even been worth her time to stumble into my apartment with me. I ran a hand over my face and swung my legs over the edge of the bed just as the bedroom door swung open. I never should have given the little brat a key. I didn’t bother to cover up; she was used to walking in and finding me hung over and naked so I didn’t see why today needed to be any different. The girl on the other side of the bed rolled over and narrowed her eyes at the new addition to our awkward little party.  
  
  “I thought you said you were single?” There was accusation in her tone that lifted the hair on the back of my neck. Any chick that was willing to come how with a stranger for a night of unattached sex didn’t get the right to cast judgment around, especially while they were still naked and rumpled in my bed.  
  
  “Give me twenty. ” I ran a hand through my messy hair and the blond in the doorway lifted an eyebrow.  
  
  “You have ten. ” I would have lifted an eyebrow back at her tone and attitude but my head was killing me and the gesture would be wasted on her anyway, she was way past immune to my shit. “I’ll make coffee, I already invited Nash but he said he has to go to the shop for an appointment. I’ll be in the car. ” She spun on her heel and just like that the doorway was empty and I was struggling to my feet and searching the floor any pair of pants I might have tossed down there last night.  
  
  “What’s going on?” I had temporarily forgotten about the girl in my bed so I swore softly under my breath and tugged a black t-shirt that looked reasonably clean over my head. “I have to go. ”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  I frowned at her as she lifted herself up in the bed and clutched the sheet to her chest. She was pretty, had a nice body from what I could see and I wondered what kind of game I had thrown at her in order to get her to come home with me. She was one I wouldn’t have minded waking up to this morning.  
  
  “I have somewhere I need to be so that means you need to get up and get going. Normally my roommate would be around so you could hangout for a minute but he had to go to work so that means you need to get that fine ass in gear and get out. ”  
  
  She sputtered a little at me. “Are you kidding me?”  
  
  I looked over my shoulder as I dug my boots out from under a pile of laundry and shoved my feet into them. “No. ”  
  
  “What kind of asshole does that? Not even a thanks for last night, you were great how about lunch, just get the fuck out!” She threw the sheet aside and I noticed she had a nice tattoo scrawling along her ribs. That was probably what attracted me to her in my drunken stupor in the first place. “You’re a real piece of work, you know that?”  
  
  I was a whole lot more than just a piece of work, but this chick that was just one of oh so many didn’t need to know that. I silently cursed at Nash. My roommate was the shit, we had been best friends since elementary school and I could normally rely on him to run interference for me on Sunday mornings when I had to bail but I forgot about the piece he was supposed to be finishing up today so I needed to hustle last night’s tail out the door and get moving before the brat left without me, which was a bigger headache than I needed in my current state.  
  
  “Hey what’s your name anyway?” If she wasn’t pissed before she was downright infuriated now as she climbed back into a super short black skirt and barely there tank top. She fluffed up mounds of clearly dyed blond hair and glared at me out of eyes now smudged with worn mascara.  
  
  “Lucy, you don’t remember?” I slimed some crap in my hair to make it stand up in a bunch of directions on sprayed on cologne to help mask the scent of sex and booze that I was sure still clung to every visible patch of skin. I shrugged a shoulder at her and waited while she walked in front of me, hopping on one foot to put on a pair of heels that just screamed dirty sex.  
  
  “I’m Rule. ” I would have offered to shake her hand but that seemed silly so I just pointed to the front door of the apartment and stepped in the bathroom to brush the stale taste of whiskey out of my mouth. “There’s coffee in the kitchen, maybe you should write your number down and I can give you a call another time. Sunday’s aren’t a good day for me. ” She would never know how true that statement was.  
  
  She glared at me and tapped the toe of one of those awesome shoes. “You really have no idea who I am do you?”  
  
  This time even against my throbbing brains wishes my eyebrow went up and I looked at her with a mouth full of toothpaste foam. I just stared at her until she screeched at me and pointed at her side, “You have to at least remember this!”  
  
  No wonder I liked her ink so much it was one of mine. I spit the toothpaste in the sink and gave myself a once over in the mirror. I looked like hell. My eyes were watery and rimmed in red, my skin looked gray and there was a hickey the size of Rhode Island on the side of my neck. Mom was just going to love that, just like she was going to fall all over herself about the current state of my hair. Normally thick and dark, I had shaved the sides of it off and dyed the front a nice, bright purple so that it stuck up straight and looked kind of like a weed-whacker had been used to cut it. Both my folks already had an issue with the scrolling ink that wound around both my arms and up the sides of my neck, so the hair was just going to be icing on the cake. There was nothing I could do to fix the current shit show looking back at me in the mirror so I prowled out of the bathroom and unceremoniously grabbed the girl by the elbow and towed her to the front door. I needed to learn to go home with them instead of letting them come home with me; it was so much easier that way.  
  
  “Look I have somewhere I have to be and I don’t particularly love that I have to go, but you freaking out and making a scene is not going to do anything other than piss me off. I hope you had a good time last night and you can leave your number but we both the chances of me calling you are slim to none. If you don’t want to be treated like crap maybe you should stop going home with drunken dudes you don’t know. Trust me we’re really only after one thing and the next morning all we really want is for you to go quietly away. I have a headache and I feel like I’m going to hurl, plus I have to spend the next hour in a car with someone that will be silently loathing me and joyously plotting my death so really can we just save the histrionics and get a move on it?”  
  
  By now I had maneuvered her to the entryway of the building and I saw her in the BMW idling in the spot next to my truck. She was impatient and would take off if I wasted anymore time. I gave Lucy a half grin and shrugged a shoulder, after all it wasn’t her fault I was an asshole and even I knew she deserved better than such a callous brush off. “Look don’t feel bad, I can be a charming bastard when I put my mind to it. You are far from the first and won’t the last that has to see this little show. I’m glad your tat turned out badass, I’d prefer you remember me for that rather than last night. ”  
  
  I jogged down the front steps without looking back and yanked open the door to the fancy black BMW. I hated this car and hated that it suited the driver as well as it did. Classy, sleek and expensive were definitely words that could be used describe my traveling companion and even as Lucy yelled at me and flipped me off as we pulled out of the lot to my apartment building all she did was roll her eyes and mutter, “Classy” under her breath. She was used to the little scenes chicks liked to throw when I bailed on them the m  
orning after; I had even had to replace her windshield once when one of them had chucked a rock at me and missed while I was walking away.  
  
  I adjusted the seat to accommodate my long legs and settled in to rest my head against the window. It was always a long and achingly silent drive, sometimes like today I was grateful for it, other times it grated on my very last nerve. We had been a fixture in each other’s lives since middle school, she knew every strength and fault I had, my parents loved her like their own and made no bones about the fact they more often than not preferred her company over mine. One would think with all the history, both good and bad between us that we could make simple small talk for a few hours without it being difficult.  
  
  “You’re going to get that junk that’s all in your hair all over my window. ” She had a voice that didn’t match the rest of her. It was all cigarettes and whiskey, while she was all champagne and silk. I had always liked her voice, when we got along I could listen to her talk for hours.  
  
  “I’ll get it detailed. ” She snorted. I closed my eyes and crossed my arms over my chest. I was all set for a silent ride but apparently she had things to say today because as soon as she pulled the car onto the highway she turned the radio down and said my name, “Rule,” I turned my head slightly to the side and cracked open an eye.  
  
  “Shaw. ” Her name was just as fancy as the rest of her. She was pale, had snowy white blond hair and big ole green eyes that looked like a Granny Smith apple. She was tiny, an easy foot shorter than my own six three, but had curves for days. She was the kind of girl that guys looked at just because they couldn’t help themselves, but as soon as she turned those frosty green eyes in their direction they knew they wouldn’t stand a chance. She exuded unattainability like some other girls oozed come and get me.  
  
  She blew a breath out and I watched as a strand of hair twirled around her forehead. She looked at me out of the corner of her eye and I stiffened up when I saw how tight her hands were on the steering wheel.  
  
  “What is it Shaw?”  
  
  She bit her bottom lip, a sure sign she was nervous. “I don’t suppose you answered any of your mom’s calls this week?”  
  
  I wasn’t exactly tight with my folks, in fact our relationship hovered somewhere around the mutually tolerable area which is why my mom sent Shaw to drag me home each weekend. We were both from a small town called Brookside in an affluent part of Colorado. I moved to Denver as soon as I had my diploma in hand and Shaw was a few years behind because she was younger than me and also because she had wanted nothing more than to get into D-U. Not only did the girl look like a fairytale princess but she was also on track to be a freaking doctor. My mom knew there was no way I would make the two hour drive there and back to see them on the weekends, but if Shaw drove and came and got me, not only would I feel guilty for making her take time out of her schedule to get me, but that I had no excuse to not go. Shaw paid for the gas, waited for me to stumble out of bed and dragged my sorry ass home every single Sunday and not once in going on two years had she complained about it.  
  
  “No, I was busy all week. ” I was busy, but I also just didn’t like talking to my mom so I had ignored her all three times she had called me this week. Shaw sighed and her hands twisted even tighter on the steering wheel. “She was calling to tell you that Rome got hurt and the Army is sending him home for six weeks of R&R. Your dad went to the military base in the Springs yesterday to pick him up. ”  
  
  I bolted up in the seat so fast that I smacked my head on the roof of the car. I swore and rubbed the spot that made my head throb anymore. “What? What do you mean he got hurt?” Rome was my older brother, he had three years on me and had been overseas for a good portion of the last six, but we were still tight and even if he didn’t like all the distance I put between me and my parents over the years if he was seriously injured I would have heard about it from him.  
  
  “I’m not sure; Margot said something happened to the convoy he was in when they were out on patrol. He was in a pretty bad accident I guess. She said his arm was broken and he had a few snapped ribs but she was pretty upset so I had a hard time understanding her when she called. ”  
  
  “Rome would have called. ”  
  
  “Rome is doped up and spent the last two days being debriefed, he asked your mom to call because you Archer boys are nothing if not persistent. Margot told him that you wouldn’t answer but he kept telling her to try. ”  
  
  My brother was hurt, but he was home and I didn’t know about it. I closed my eyes again and let my head drop back against the headrest. “Well hell, that’s good news I guess. ”  
  
  “Are you going to go by and see your mom?” I didn’t have to look at her to know that she had stiffened even more. I could practically feel the tension rolling off of her in icy waves.  
  
  “No. ” She didn’t say more and I didn’t expect her to. The Archers might not have been the closest, warmest bunch, but we didn’t have anything on the Landon’s. Shaw’s family craped gold and breathed money, they also cheated and lied, were divorced and remarried and from what I had seen over the years had little need or interest in the biological daughter that came from a union figured out on a tax form rather than a bedroom. I knew Shaw loved my house, loved my parents because it was the only semblance of normalcy she had ever experienced and I didn’t begrudge her that, in fact I appreciated the fact she took most of the heat off of me. If Shaw was doing good in school, dating an affluent undergrad, living the life my parents had always wanted for their sons but had been denied they stayed off my case and since Rome was usually a continent away I was the only one they could get to so I took no shame in using Shaw as a buffer.  
  
  “Man I haven’t even talked to Rome in three months. It’ll be awesome to see him. I wonder if I can convince him to come spend some time in D-town with me and Nash. He’s probably more than ready for a little bit of fun. ”  
  
  She sighed again and moved to turn the radio back up a little bit. “You’re twenty-two Rule, when are you going to stop acting like an indulgent teenager? Did you even ask this one her name? In case you were wondering you smell like a mix between a distillery and a strip club. ”  
  
  I snorted and let my eyes drift back shut. “You’re nineteen, Shaw when are you going to stop living your life by everyone else’s standards? My eighty-two year old grandma has more of a social calendar than you and I think she’s less uptight. ” I wasn’t going to tell her what she smelled like because it was sweet and lovely and I had no desire to be nice at the moment.  
  
  I could feel her glaring at me and I hid a grin. “I like Ethel. ” Her tone was surly.  
  
  “Everybody likes Ethel. She’s feisty and won’t take crap from anyone. You could learn a thing or two from her. ”  
  
  “Oh maybe I should just dye my hair pink, tattoo every visible surface of my body, shove a bunch of metal in my face and sleep with everything that moves, isn’t that your philosophy on how to live a rich and fulfilling life?”  
  
  That made me crank my eyes back open and the marching band in my head decided to go for round two.  
  
  “At least I’m doing what I want. I know who and what I am Shaw, and I don’t make any apologies for it. I hear plenty of Margot Archer coming out of your pretty mouth right now. ”  
  
  Her mouth twisted down into a frown. “Whatever, let’s just go back to ignoring each other, I just thought you should know about Rome, the Archer boys have never been big on surprises. ”  
  
  She was right. In my experience surprises were never a good thing, they usually resulted in someone getting pissed and me ending up in some kind of fight. I loved my brother but I had to admit I was kind of irritated he hadn’t one, bothered to let me know he was hurt, and two, was still trying to force me to play nice with my folks. I figured her plan to ignore each other the rest of the way was a winner so I slumped down as far as the sporty little car would allow and started to doze off. I was only out for twenty minutes or so when her phone started singing The Civil Wars and jarred me awake. I blinked gritty eyes and rubbed a hand over the scruff on my face. If the hair didn’t piss mom off the fact I was too busy to shave for her precious brunch might just send her into hysterics.  
  
  “No, I told you I’m going to Brookside and won’t be back until late. ” I looked across the car at her and she must have felt my gaze because she looked at me quickly and I saw a little bit of pink work its way into her high cheeks. “No Gabe, I told you I don’t have time and that I have a lab due. ” I couldn’t make out the words but whoever was on the other end of the phone sounded angry at her brush off. I saw her fingers tighten on the phone. “It’s none of your business; I have to go now, so I’ll talk to you later. ” She swiped a finger across the screen and tossed the fancy device into the cup holder by my knee.  
  
  “Trouble in paradise?” I didn’t really care about Shaw and her richer than God, future ruler of the known universe boyfriend, but it was polite to ask when someone was obviously upset. I hadn’t ever met Gabe, but from what I heard from mom when I bothered to listen he was custom made to go with Shaw’s future doctor persona. His family was as loaded as hers, his dad was a judge, or lawyer, or some other political nonsense I had no use for and I was sure beyond the shadow of a doubt the dude had to wear pleated slacks and pink polo shirts with white loafers. For a long moment I didn’t think she was going to respond but she cleared her throat and started tapping out a beat on the steering wheel with her obviously expensively manicured fingers.  
  
  “Not really, we broke up but I don’t think Gabe really gets it. ”  
  
  “Really?”  
  
  “Yeah, a couple weeks ago actually. I’ve been thinking about doing it for a while. I’m just too busy with school and work to have a boyfriend. ”  
  
  “If it was the right guy you wouldn’t feel that way. You would make the time because you wanted to be with him. ”  
  
  She looked at me with both blond brows raised up to her hair line. “Are you, Mr. Manwhore of the Century seriously trying to give me relationship advice?”  
  
  I rolled my eyes which made my head scream in protest. “Just because there hasn’t been one girl I wanted to hang out with exclusively doesn’t mean I don’t know that difference between quality and quantity. ”  
  
  “Could have fooled me, besides Gabe wanted more than I was willing to give and it’s going to be a pain because my Mom and Dad both loved him. ”  
  
  “True that, from what I’ve heard he was pretty much custom made to make your folks happy. What do you mean he wanted to more than you were willing to give? Did he try and put a rock on your finger after only six months?”  
  
  She gave me a look and curled her lip up in a sneer. “Not even close, he just wanted things to be more serious than I wanted them to be. ”  
  
  I laughed a little and rubbed between my eyebrows. My headache had turned into a dull throb but was starting to be manageable. I needed to ask her to swing by a Starbucks or something if I was going to get through this afternoon.  
  
  “Is that your prissy way of telling me that he was trying to get in your pants and you weren’t having it?”  
  
  She narrowed her eyes at me and pulled off on the exit that took us towards Brookside.  
  
  “I need you t  
o stop by Starbucks before going to my parents’ house, and don’t think I didn’t notice you aren’t answering my question?”  
  
  “If we stop we’re going to be late and not every boy thinks with what’s in their pants. ”  
  
  “The sky isn’t going to fall on us if we show up five minutes behind Margot’s schedule, and you have got to be kidding me, you strung that loser along for six months without giving it up, what a joke. ”  
  
  That made me flat-out laugh at her. I laughed so hard that I had to hold my head in both hands as my whisky logged brain started to protest by screaming at me. I gasped a little and looked at her with watery eyes. “If you really believe that you aren’t nearly as smart as I always thought you were. Every single dude under the age of ninety is trying to get in your pants, Shaw, especially if he’s thinking that he’s your boy. I’m a guy, I know this shit. ”  
  
  She bit her lip again conceding I probably had a valid point and pulled the car into the coffee shop. I practically bolted out, eager to stretch my legs and get a little distance from her typically haughty attitude. There was a line when I got inside and I cast a quick look around to see if I recognized anyone because Brookside was a pretty small town and usually when I stopped by on the weekends I inevitably ran into some I used to go to school with. I hadn’t bothered to ask Shaw if she wanted me to grab her anything because she was still being all uppity about having to stop in the first place. It was almost my turn to order when my phone started blasting a Social Distortion song in my pocket. I dug it out after ordering a big ass black coffee and took a spot on the counter next to a cute brunette that was trying her hardest not get caught checking me out.  
  
  “What up?”  
  
  I could hear the music in the shop blaring behind Nash when he asked, “How did this morning go?”  
  
  Nash knew my faults and bad habits better than anyone and the reason we had maintained our friendship as long as we had was because he never judged me based on those factors.  
  
  “Sucked. I’m hung-over, grumpy and about to sit through yet another forced family function, plus Shaw is rare form today. ”  
  
  “How was the chick from last night?”  
  
  “No clue. I don’t even remember getting home from the bar but apparently I did a huge piece on her side so she was a little pissed I didn’t remember who she was, so ouch. ”  
  
  He chuckled on the other end of the line. “She told you that like six times last night, she even tried to pull her top off to show you and I drove your dumb ass home last drunko. I tried to get you to leave at like midnight but you weren’t having any of it as usual. ”  
  
  I snorted and reached for the coffee when the guy behind the counter called my name. I noticed the brunette’s eyes follow the hand that wrapped around the cardboard cup. It was the one that had the flared head of a king cobra on it. The rest of the snake wound its way up my forearm and around my elbow, the extended forked tongue made the “L” on my ring finger in the tattoo of my name that was inked across the four knuckles of the same hand. Her mouth made a little O of surprise so I flashed her a wink and walked back to the BMW.

I'm sharing this because it has been requested many times and I think it might benefit people. Some of the content is not my creation, it's just a compilation of quotes that I thought needed recording and revisiting during dire times.* *This is just a fraction of the journal.

1. Nothing in this world leads to greater good than the tamed and developed mind. Nothing in this world leads to greater suffering and harm than the untamed mind. (The Buddha)
2. Your problem is not the problem, Your reaction is the problem. (The Buddha)
3. In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
4. No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind.
5. When do I know who my real friends are? Tough times tell you about your real friends. Right now, I'm going through tough times, Am I my Real Friend? Am I guiding my lower self to a better future? Nothing can be gained without sacrifice. **Even God demands sacrifice of pleasure.**
6. Freedom is not lack of temptation, it is the presence of emotional discipline.
7. As long as you struggle, you have not failed son.
8. A man who can control his lust is a dangerous man. He is unstoppable. THE FINAL BOSS FIGHT is holding on to your sexual energy and using it wisely. It is the hardest thing you will ever do in your life. What business do you have watching another man penetrating a woman? Why are you getting your rocks off watching it? It's a generation of Kucks.
9. Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better. Don't wish for less problems, wish for more skills. Don't wish for longer SR run, but the character that resists all temptations. If you change, everything will change. 
10. While everyone talks about 100 Men Vs 1 Gorilla, No one talks about 1 Man Vs 100 Temptations.
11. Masturbating everyday 3-4 times a day MAKES YOU FEMININE. It's a biological fact. It's called Prolactin. It's a brain chemical that increases drowsiness. It reduces the masculine drive and motivation. Too much prolactin in your system is HYPER-FEMINIZING, it can lead to feminine physical traits like Man-boobs, it can also lead to developing feminine behavioural traits.
12. Temptations, edging, dopamine chasing of any kind is a 100% liability. The number 1 way to destroy yourself is to get the low hanging fruit of easy dopamine BEFORE you put in the effort.
13. Chasing pleasure NEVER EVER ENDS WELL, IN ANY UNIVERSE
14. When I am truly mentally, physically, spiritually celibate, I cannot sit still. I HAVE TO TRANSMUTE the energy. It gives me mountains of motivation. Such chi attracts everyone around you but that does not concern you.
15. Conversation with IRL friend: (Trigger Alert)>!A lot of men are being protected from modern immoral women by some kind of force in their lives. Yet so many men complain not getting p\*sy, not being able to get into a relationship, sometimes even attention of a woman is enough for these men. The whole time something is protecting them and trying to keep them focused but they want to get rid of that just to get a piece of p\*sy. That is the dumbest shit in the world to me: You have the most valuable thing in the world: Time, No distractions, No bad women getting on your nerves, leeching your energy, to focus on yourself and your projects, your craft.!<
16. >!(Continued)...And you want to throw all these things away to fuck some hole, 20 other dudes have already been in and came in multiple times. A lot of men don't even have the mental resilience to deal with modern women anyway. Half of men will be behind bars for violence if they knew what these women do, specially the ones in relationship. If something is keeping these kind of women away from you, its not a bad thing, its a sign that you should probably work on yourself, work on developing the sharpness of mind so you can sift through these women, identify their masks, lay these masks bare and move on until you find the woman who is as innocent as you. But until then put all your resources, time and energy in developing your mental faculty of seeing through bullshit. Be sharp. They shouldn't be even be a threat to you as a man. The problem with men is that they cannot tell the difference between a promiscuous woman and a wife. !<
17. First you fall in love. Then you confess and find it returned in full. Ask anyone and they'll say its a wonderful thing. But they are so very wrong. What people really love is the idea of love. Feelings can only reach so high until they come crashing down to the dark depths. The True Yearning is for the game. No telling if that person is your soulmate. Eternal love may not even exist. But you'll never know for sure if you don't take the plunge. Just arm yourself with the sharpest of minds before attempting the near-impossible feat of finding true love. Let your heart man the helm but your brain navigate that seas, lest you stray from the course. For only those who use their minds, can ever hope to attain the legendary true love. 
18. Corollary to point 15: Morality alone is not good enough. You need strategy and morality both. Develop the mind, sharpen it, recognize the patterns, don't drown the mind in self defeating pleasure.
19. One thing I really wish I knew sooner: You need to exercise your sexual energy with discipline now more than ever. Even if you feel lonely or bored, you need to protect that energy. Because when you're getting with someone, it's not just you just getting with this ONE person. Each time you partake in sexual acts, you are building a soul tie with this person, these are like invisible chains that interlock your soul with this person that make you unable to see their red flags, which makes it so much harder to walk away from this person. You are ALSO tapping into this person's whole family tree/lineage because at the end of the day thats what we all are products of: The product of our family's energies and traumas. When you intertwine yourself that deep into their energy mindlessly, you will find out that some of these people have deep serious illnesses in their families that we cannot see because we are blinded by lust. When you eventually become aware of it, it gets even harder to break free from these lust demons the more you partake. On top of that, this person you've been giving your energy is probably won't even end up being your spouse. Remember: Move with strategy, even if you can easily get some tonight, if you refuse sex with the wrong person you are reclaiming your power, you are refusing to bring this damage upon you which will increase exponentially with each indulgence.If you cannot actually get with someone who looks good on the outside its good because the creator forces are protecting you. 
20. Situationships is the product of a generational psychological epidemic. The young generation is overly stimulated by abundance of options, so they never ever fully commit to one person, they always have one foot out the door. Dating apps give you this illusion of options too. Swiping everyday like people are products, even though we get with someone awesome, that behavior from decades of conditioning makes us think there is a potential better option out there, which keeps them from committing fully. The buzzword for that is ""Emotionally Unavailable"". We are like chameleons, one eye at one option and the other at another. You can sleep with a modern woman 10 times and she won't catch feelings. There is inflation even in intimacy nowadays.
21. To the untrained mind, the vagina is a coffin for the man's soul. And some men gloat about having full sized graveyards in their lawns.
22. 60% of the marriages who are getting divorced are a bunch of people who never took the time to learn to love themselves so they employ someone else to do it.
23. You have hundreds of books unread, your muscles are untrained, your skills are untouched and you are bored?
24. You are poor because when it rains, you think about sex instead of farming.
25. Conversation with IRL friend:  >!Man to man talk, if you are losing your mind over a girl that some other man is tired of fucking, you are not busy enough.!<
26. Women cheat on Billionaires, women cheat on celebrities, women cheat on jacked, handsome guys, nothing can keep a woman who doesn't want to be kept.  One of the most important skill you can develop is how to screen the good women from bad. Move strategically not emotionally. Morality alone is not enough. You need morality + surgical precision. 
27. Manifestation sounds too good to be true because it is too good to be true. Real life humbles you. You cannot manifest your way out of betrayal, you cannot manifest a prostitute into a housewife. You cannot manifest your relationship into a healthy one. You have to physically do the work, water where the grass is not green. Manifestation is just wishful thinking.
28. The real grounded wisdom does not come from affirmations, it does not even come from lived experience, it comes ONLY from observation and awareness. Which is why many people are 10 years into Semen Retention but still can't retain for more than 6 months. 10 years in SR and they are still fapping away their souls, their courage, their wisdom. 
29. (Cont) The Only proof that learning has happened is change in behaviour, if the behaviour has not changed, learning has not happened. Behavior is the language of truth. Everything else is noise.
30. Life is strange : Doing hard stuff requires high pressure tolerance. Building High pressure tolerance requires doing hard stuff.
31. (Cont) Banks loan money to people who already have money. 
32. (Cont) Women like men who already have other women.
33. (Cont) The less you move the less you feel like moving.
34. (Cont) The more you move the more moving you want to do.
35. (Cont) The more you release the more you WANT to release.
36. (Cont) Craving will NEVER quench it will give rise to more craving.
37. (Cont) A body at rest will remain at rest. A body in motion will stay in motion.
38. (Cont) A disciplined man who has 100 good habits can build that one good habit easily but a sloth will require insane will power to develop that 1 good habit.
39. (Cont) You need will power to have will power
40. (Cont) Its a serpent eating its own tail. There is no starting point. Just do it right now.
41. This was written down in one of my lowest moments. This was one of the turning points in my life. I'm sure every long term retainer goes through this at some point. I was sleep deprived, hungry, tried to connect with my family but they were busy. I only had my own company here. Even though I had a long streak already, I was sad. Unsurprisingly, this is exactly when I felt a huge tsunami of sexual urge: *""So, Right now in this very moment here, I make the decision to just not betray myself. This has nothing to do with retention benefits. Absolutely Nothing. Fuck the benefits, fuck the attraction, fuck the women, fuck the muscles, the respect, I don't care. Its got everything to do with me letting myself down when it matters. Nobody has my back, not even me. I am tired of losing. I need a victory and I am gonna take that victory right now.""* This night ended up being the start of my dopamine fasting along with SR. I consider this night my 2nd birth.
42. A true believer is at war with his sin. A false believer is at peace with it.
43. Do not listen to the people who are saying ""Wow, dude you are doing great, you are so awesome, you have changed so much, O my gosh, wow"" DO NOT BELIEVE THEM. You keep your head down and keep working, you are not there yet. You still suck at a lot of things and have a lot of things to achieve yet. There are people far better than you with more self control than you. If you roll in the applaud of the masses, you will develop an affinity to it. That affinity will keep you with them.
44. A man asked a gardener why his plants grew so beautifully. The gardener said: ""I don't force them to grow. I remove what stops them.""
45. ""How can God trust you with his own daughter if he can't even trust you with your own hand?""
46. Everybody is trying to find the right person but nobody is trying to be the right person.
47. A man is at his happiest when he pushes his mind and body as hard as humanly possible.
48. The tree falls the way it leans. Be careful which way you lean. (aka Don't edge or fantasize you dumbass)
49. Your habits are telling your future louder than your words ever could.
50. You NEVER rise to the level of your expectations. You fall to the level of your training.
51. Those who sweat more in peace, bleed less during war.
52. You need Olympic-athlete level control of your thoughts if you actually want to create the life you desire.
53. Ejaculation makes you weak, staying horny makes you hungry and powerful. Keep your Stomach empty and your balls full.
54. For a man love is tied directly to his competency. If you own a dog and it gets sick, you don't have money to pay the vet. You do not love that dog. If your mom and dad are in debt and you are sleeping until 12pm, playing video games, smoking weed, you do not love them. If you want a wife but your finances, impulse control, habits are not in order, you do not want a wife, you want sex, its just another impulse. If you love someone truly, you will work on your competency, you will work hard until your nails fall off to protect them. Being incompetent means you only love your temporary impulsive experiences. Nothing else, don't delude yourself.
55. The most difficult thing I ever did in my life is give up all the transient pleasures in life- Dopamine Fasting: No One punch man for me, no phone, no fast food, no coffee, nothing. Why am I suffering through all of this? I need to remind myself why. This is my why: The number 1 ingredient that differentiates the regular guy like me from the elites is Hunger. Hunger that doesn't go away, not hunger to lose some weight in the summer or go 90 days of SR, the hunger to be more, to do more, to conquer more, to create more, to become something, to give something of value to the world. I am doing this to wake up that component that I know is alive inside me. That hunger that has temporarily been anaesthetized  by games, PMO, fear NEEDS TO GO AWAY. The drive in me that makes me masculine. The same drive that wants me to penetrate the very fabric of nature and become more active.
56. (Contd) That HUNGER ONLY COMES FROM NOT HAVING THINGS and PLEASURES of life. It needs to be developed by Deprivation. Deprive yourself to become more. A hungry lion is a dangerous lion. Stomache empty Balls Full.
57. (Contd) There are plenty of reasons to quit. You just oughta have more reason to keep going.
58. Your actions, no matter how small, reflect your state of mind. If you relapse, you haven't learnt anything. Change in Behaviour is the only authentic symptom of progress.
59. Get up again, Don't think, Don't Talk, Just Act.
60. An autist who acts more than he thinks is 1000x better than a genius who never acts on his higher order thoughts. Be an autist.
61. Skip the gym and life only gets harder.
62. Chase that dream like you chased that girl that didn't want you.
63. Don't expect to find diamonds in a cave where torches have already been placed.
64. Only the man who sits with his demons long enough knows they are his teachers in disguise. Never skip meditation.
65. A man becomes soft when his days know no struggle and his hands know no calluses, he forgets that his body is a weapon and every weapon dulls without use. He begins to fear the discomfort that once made him dangerous, the fire inside him dims, replaced by the warm rot of idleness.
66. Contd - When the day of reckoning comes, he will pray for the strength he squandered but strength is not given on the day of battle, it is built on the days when no one is watching in silent boredom. We don't rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training.
67. Never ever pay attention to the words of boys who say they can fight, just check if their knuckles are tender or callused.
68. I went from wanting to be checked up on everyday to preferring to be left alone until people need something from me. Such is the power of SR.
69. A painful clarity is 1000x better than the hope that keeps you trapped in confusion.
70. I don't mind helping people even if I don't expect anything in return. People like me don't have people, I am the people that other people have.
71. If you wish to be more successful on the outside, you have to win the negotiations on the inside. Your life inside is the only thing you can control. The more you go to work on the inside, the more rapidly your external world changes. \[Redacted\], \[Redacted\] say how I have changed so much in the past few days. They don't know the change started internally weeks ago, it only manifested and reached their senses now. There is always a lag in feedback of progress from the outside world. You need to be patient and resilient to boredom.
72. **A fish with his mouth closed NEVER GETS CAUGHT.** *I sold my smartphone after this. I meant to close as many opportunities of dopamine and SR relapse as possible. My smartphone was that ever present opportunity.*
73. Stop helping people who are committed to the story that suits their dysfunction. Choose your battles wisely, you have limited energy. A person with a victim mindset will never achieve victory.
74. You will always sabotage what you don't believe you deserve. You cannot help a person who is infatuated with hurting themselves. Distance yourself from these people.
75. Behind my skills that impress you now, there was once a guy who practiced it through crippling boredom.
76. Stand firm, stand strong, the whole universe bows down to a disciplined mind.
77. ""Why don't you enjoy a little and have a drink with us?"". *There is a difference between enjoying your youth and destroying your mind and your future.*
78. Be consumed by your ambition, there is no deeper betrayal than abandoning your own becoming.
79. Kill lust, before it kills you. Lust isn't just temptation, its destruction, disguised as desire and if you don't deal with it now, it will destroy everything God has planned for your life, your marriage, your ministry, your relationship with Him. Lust doesn't negotiate, it consumes. You think you can manage it? You think you can keep it under control? Let it live in corners of your mind and heart? Lust is never satisfied with the corners, it wants to take over the throne of your rational mind. The throne of your mind is where Christ belongs, not lust. Every time you feed your lust, you're starving your spirit. You're building walls between you and God. Trading intimacy with the creator of the universe for temporary pleasure. The pleasure that leaves you empty and ashamed. KILL LUST BEFORE IT KILLS YOUR CALLING. KILL IT BEFORE IT KILLS you.
80. If hard work always led to success, the donkey would own the farm. Develop your mind.
81. All of us are selective sinners. We choose the sins we are comfortable with and judge others that commit the ones we're not comfortable with.
82. Sure there is freedom of speech but that will not guarantee you freedom AFTER speech. Speak carefully.
83. Some people find God in the pit of their sin; others lose Him on the throne of their blessings.
84. Horses that go in battle, never dances in wedding (party or be disciplined)
85. Physical training is non-negotiable for men. If a CEO can run a company, raise 3 kids, cheat on his wife, still make it to a cold play concert. You have time to go to the gym.
86. Any high amount of dopamine that comes to you BEFORE effort, will eventually destroy you.
87. Soft body reflects soft mind. Soft bodies breaks during war.
88. A healthy man has a 1000 problems, a sick man has only one. Respect your body, don't let the weapon get dull. Gym is the most important thing in your life right now.
89. The sheep spends its whole life worrying about the wolf, yet in the end, it's the shepherd who eats it. 
90. Happiness is not obtained through the pleasure you get, Happiness is obtained through what you become.
91. >!The last stroke that makes you nut, doesn't mean the first stroke was useless. !<Success is the result of continuous effort, specially the first step.
92. Depression is your avatar telling you it is tired of playing the character you're trying to play. 
93. Its incredibly easy to tell someone's future including yours. Just listen to what people are talking about, their future follows their attention. Yours too. If your attention is on short reels, you future will be short. This is why a developed and aware mind is the number one thing to cultivate. Meditation is a must.
94. I have never ever seen a person who gave up a bad habit one day and 5 years, 10 years down the road looked back and said, ""I regret doing that"". Not one person in the history of the world has ever regretted kicking a bad habit.
95. No matter how bad the blizzard is, I must go to the gym. Why? Because No matter how tall the mountain is, The sun always rises.
96. If you want to go far in life, learn to be bored, silent and alone. Isolation forges greatness.
97. Today my friend said, ""You've become ballsy ever since you gained a little mass. Don't get too cocky you're still small"". ""My courage isn't in the muscles, it's in my balls"" Literally.
98. Once I started boxing, I realized how weak the average man is, I was even weaker.
99. I really wanted to find out who the elites protecting the SR information were, who exactly the enemy was. I really took my time to find out who the enemy was, it wasn't them who was my enemy. It was my inner me that was the enemy.
100. If someone else has the power to make you happy then by definition they have the power to make you unhappy too by removing that happiness.
101. The best skill a person can have is to never get tempted. His attention must walk on the razor's edge in today's sexualized world. Otherwise you'll descend into the animal realm, your attention if uncontrolled will take you to the depths of hell where evil hides. You know what they say about hell. The road to hell feels like heaven, the road to heaven feels like hell. Choose your road.
102. Women yap about confidence being the #1 trait they find attractive. Its not confidence its courage. Courage is what separates an androgenous blob with no backbone from a man. Every man feels scared. Courageous men just overcome the fear and act despite it. Don't be a fool though and go into extremes. Use your head, the right head. Your Semen is the Serum of Courage. You are spraying courage out of you every time you jerk off. Confidence is just being courageous 24/7.

  
I have like 1500 more but typing it is taking longer than I thought so I'll stop here and call it a night.

1n4i09f,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1n4i09f/confused/,Confused,"My primary partner and I have been married for 4 years. We have been open (and now poly) for our entire relationship. I’ve never felt like my primary partner really likes me, they like the idea of me…they don’t like that I have tattoos, my naturally curly hair, they don’t give me compliments on my outfits, their response to most of who I am is a thinly veiled criticism of what I should do differently to be more appealing. Also, they don’t want to do things with me, mostly sit on the couch and watch tv while playing on their phone. I am unable to do this because the vast majority of the household tasks and all the child activities and responsibilities fall on me (they are my bio, but even an activity pick up is made to seem like a big ask). To be clear, we both work full time from home. I find myself feeling very alone when I am with them and would rather not be in their presence, because when I am, I feel anxious. 

I’ve been dating a secondary partner who is not otherwise attached. They are kind, attentive, plan things for us to do, even if it’s just grabbing coffee, they compliment me, they even take out the trash at my house while I cook dinner, something my primary partner needs to have pointed out and then be reminded to do. They pay attention to what I say, I mentioned my favorite restaurant and they made reservations there. The biggest difference is, I feel relaxed with them. 

I have not had a relationship like this since we became poly. Is it normal to feel such a disparity in your relationships? Am I just experiencing NRE with my secondary partner, since the dopamine is flowing? Has anyone met a secondary partner and realized the dynamic of the primary relationship isn’t working?",1,1756603211.0,polyamory,5,1.0,False

  My thoughts were spinning out of control and I gripped William’s hands tightly in mine until the skin of my knuckles turned white.  
  
  “Marry me,” William repeated, his eyes burning into mine. My words caught in my throat and I suddenly had the urge to flee.  
  
  “What if…what if someone found out? What if you lose your job?” My voice was panicked and I was practically yelling. He placed his hand on my cheek and stroked it soothingly. I closed my eyes, trying to calm myself down.  
  
  “I don’t care about any of that anymore, but even if I did, you’re not my student anymore. When I almost lost you, I realized what was important to me. I don’t ever want you to leave my side again. ” He pressed his lips against mine, begging me to say yes. I got lost in his touch for a moment but quickly regained composure.  
  
  “I can’t ask you to do that,” I said, placing my hand on his chest. His heart was beating wildly. His muscles flexed under his jaw.  
  
  “You didn’t ask,” he replied, his words sharp and I could tell he was on the verge of losing his patience.  
  
  “I’m not saying no. ” My voice was barely a whisper. I wanted so badly to jump in his arms and scream yes from the top of my lungs but I couldn’t be the reason he lost everything in his life. I knew his father hated me and make his life miserable.  
  
  He would eventually regret it and in turn, he would regret me. His body pulled back from mine. I put my hands on either side of his face and stared him directly in the eye. “I want to marry you. I just need some time. Take things slow,” I said, forcing a small smile. William’s hands met mine and he squeezed them gently.  
  
  “That’s all I want,” he said, wrapping his arms around me and spinning me around. I couldn’t help but let myself get lost in his happiness. I squeezed his neck tightly and buried my face in his chest, breathing in his musky scent. When I thought about all we had been through; the ex-wife, the jealous girlfriend, the even more jealous husband of said girlfriend and the horrible way William’s father had treated us, I couldn’t even begin to imagine how others would take the news of us being married. I wanted to run away with him. I wanted to forget about Florida and all of the trouble that had come along so far and just get lost with him, but I knew that was impossible. Even with all of the money in the world, and William did possess quite a bit, we could never hide from everyone forever. His family would find out—and probably cut him off. William kissed me softly, lingering just above my mouth, leaving me craving more. The mood around us shifted from panic and excitement to pure lust. I slipped my fingers up his neck into his hair. His hand twisted into a knot in my hair, tugging gently.  
  
  “Never leave me, Emma,” he whispered.  
  
  “Never,” I replied. His mouth found mine, hard. His tongue pushed gently against my lips and I let them fall open for him. His other hand slid down my spine and over my bottom, squeezing gently. I let out a quiet moan into his mouth. His hand moved further down my thigh and rested below my knee. He pulled my leg up to his side as his breathing became heavier. I wanted more than anything to feel his flesh against mine, to rid my thoughts of all that we had endured. I tugged feverishly at his belt as my body ached for him. I cried out as he pushed the length of himself into my thigh.  
  
  “I want you. ” I breathed heavily as dampness pooled between my legs. He shoved me back onto the couch and quickly undid his shirt. I was completely caught up in the moment, sliding my hand down my thigh towards my most sensitive areas. His eyes burned with wanting as he threw his shirt to the ground and quickly undid his belt and slipped his jeans down his legs.  
  
  “Take your clothes off. ” His voice was low and his eyes traveled down my body as he spoke. I bit my lip and slipped my t-shirt over my head, revealing my bare swollen breasts. His jaw clenched and I continued, pulling off my shorts and panties as I lay back on the couch. I rested my hand just below my belly, running my fingertips over my skin. “Show me how badly you want me. ”  
  
  His words sent a shiver down my spine and my fingers automatically responded to the seductive sound of his voice. I slipped my hand lower, my fingers gliding effortlessly across my wetness. I let out a breath as I felt my insides tighten. William’s hand mirrored mine as he slowly stroked himself.  
  
  “You are so beautiful. ”  
  
  With his words, I became bolder, dipping a finger inside myself, my back arching in response.  
  
  “Oh, god,” I panted as he lowered himself onto the couch.  
  
  “Don’t stop,” he instructed as he traced the entrance of me with his hardness. I began to rub harder as he slipped the tip of himself inside, causing all of my muscles to tighten in response. I wanted him inside of me, deep inside of me, and I was willing to do anything he asked. His fingers found mine and he slowed my movements, making my hand move in smaller, more deliberate circles. He rocked his hips slightly, just enough to tease my body. I let my free hand slide over my breast, my nipple hardening under my fingers the way he had made it do before. I pinched it gently, as his eyes wandered over my body. My hips rocked against my hand and I was struggling to control my breathing.  
  
  “Does that feel good?” he asked, and I could barely find my voice to answer. I nodded, my lips parted.  
  
  He slipped himself in a little further and my body reacted, grabbing him and trying desperately to pull him deeper inside of me. I raised my hips, silently begging him to slide in deeper but he held firm. “That is enough of that. ” He grabbed my wrists and pushed them over my head. I lifted my hips again, desperate to find my release. He responded by pulling out of me completely. He repositioned himself so that he held both of my hands in one of his and slipped the other down between my legs. He slowly dragged the tip of his finger up and down, barely touching my skin.  
  
  “William, please,” I cried out, tugging against his hand. He dipped a finger inside of me suddenly, nearly sending me over the edge. His mouth just inches from mine as I panted. “Please” I moaned and he slipped a second finger inside, angling just right to touch places inside of me that I didn’t even know existed. I rocked against his hand, unable to stop myself. I widened my legs, making sure he could have a clear view of what he was missing. He took his thumb and slowly circled over my most sweet spot as his fingers continued to slide in and out of me. “Oh, god!” I turned my head, pressing it against the cushion.  
  
  “Look at me. ” His breath tickled my ear. I turned to look him in the eye, breathing in his sweet minty breath. “You wanted to take things slow. ”  
  
  I bucked against him with my hips out of frustration. I hadn’t said no to his proposal; I just needed more time to process everything we had been through.  
  
  “You’re punishing me?” I couldn’t hide the anger in my voice. I wanted to slap him, and might have if he didn’t have my hands pinned down. A smile crept across his face.  
  
  “I’m just doing as you asked. You have more control than you realize, Emma. ” His fingers slowly began to move again. I wanted to be mad at him but my body betrayed me. My hips rocked against his hand. His smile grew wider as he licked his lips and leaned closer. His breath was warm against my ear and sent a shiver throughout my body. “I only want to please you, Emma. ” His lips brushed along my neck.  
  
  “Then fuck me,” I panted as my core tightened around him. He withdrew his fingers and shoved himself inside of me forcefully. I moaned into his ear as his grip on my hands tightened with each thrust. I wrapped my legs around him, giving him deeper access.  
  
  “I want every part of you, Emma,” he panted.  
  
  “I’m yours, William. ”  
  
  We exploded together, our bodies becoming one for a brief moment in time. He collapsed heavily on top of my and he released my wrists  
. He put his hands on either side of me to push himself off the couch. I wrapped my hands around his neck and pulled him back into me.  
  
  “Please don’t go. ” His body tensed for a moment but he did not pull against me. I knew I was asking a lot from him. All of these feelings were just as new to him as they were to me. He relaxed back onto me and pushed my hair out of my face with his fingers.  
  
  “I don’t think I could leave you if I tried. ” He put his forehead against mine and let out a heavy breath. I let my fingers slip into his hair.  
  
  It was frightening how quickly I had fallen for William. He consumed me. It didn’t matter if he was good for me anymore. It only mattered that I was with him.  
  
  We spent the rest of the night entangled in each other. As the sun rose, I tried to unwrap our bodies so I could make a fresh pot of coffee. William’s arms tightened around me like a snake, holding me firmly in place.  
  
  “Don’t leave me,” he mumbled into my chest.  
  
  “I’m not leaving you. I just want to make some coffee,” I whispered as I pushed against him.  
  
  “You will. ” From the tone of his voice, it was obvious he was lost in a nightmare. I stopped struggling and kissed the top of his head. I rubbed his back and waited for him to awaken. When he did, he seemed oblivious to the earlier conversation. It was hard to imagine someone like William feeling like he had no control.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  William rubbed the sleep from his eyes and smiled as he glanced down at me. He had awakened in a great mood judging by the length of him pressed firmly against my inner thigh.  
  
  “It’s hard to imagine I am not dreaming. ” He gave me a quick peck on the lips. It was an innocent gesture, but he lingered and the air around us grew thick with desire.  
  
  “If we don’t get off this couch soon, we may die of starvation,” I joked.  
  
  He laughed, his whole body gyrating against me in response. “You’re right. I haven’t eaten in a while. ” His eyes narrowed as he slid himself down the length of my body, leaving a trail of kisses along the way. My hands ran through his hair as my back arched towards him.  
  
  “William,” I giggled. “We need to get ready for the day. ”  
  
  “Why?” he asked as he nuzzled my inner thigh. It tickled and I squirmed against him.  
  
  “I want you to meet my family. ”  
  
  His head shot up and his eyes locked onto mine.  
  
  “I thought you didn’t want anyone to know about us?”  
  
  “I don’t think my aunt would tell anyone. Besides, she doesn’t have to know who your father is. ” If William wanted to take a big step like marriage, it was only right that he meet my family first. I only wish he could have met my parents, although they may not have approved of our relationship.  
  
  William slid back up the length of my body and rubbed my cheek with the pad of his thumb.  
  
  “I’ll do whatever it takes to be with you. ”  
  
  I wrapped my arms around his neck and squeezed him tightly. His hands tangled in my hair as we lay in each other’s arms. I could see us doing this every day for the rest of our lives. He had become my obsession. My every thought. I needed him to feel whole. Everything in my life before him was filled with loneliness.  
  
  Part of me wanted to introduce him to Judy to show her I was worthy of happiness. Worthy of someone’s love. She should have been the person I ran to when I was feeling lonely, but she pushed me away. She was uncaring and cold. Unable to show love to me.  
  
  William was different. His world revolved around mine. I still couldn’t understand his affection for me. No one had ever looked at me the way he does. Never touched me the way he does. He was intense and overwhelming, but he was mine and I was his. I loved that feeling of belonging to someone.  
  
  I felt safe with him even in the midst of all the chaos that swarmed our relationship. No matter how dominating and controlling he appeared from the outside, I knew better. He was scared to feel, scared to love, and scared to lose.  
  
  I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t terrified to introduce him to my aunt. She was judgmental and distant. Regardless of how she responded, she would know that I was worthy of someone’s love. I need him and I needed her to know that I didn’t need her.

I expected William to be more resistant to the idea of meeting her. I had hoped for it. Going through with this would not only put her in her place, but it would make all of this that I had with William real. I’m not sure which part of that scared me more.  
  
  “Take a nice hot shower. I’ll cook us some breakfast. ” William kissed me gently on the forehead and smiled before pushing up onto his elbows and sliding off the couch. I stretched like a cat before taking his hand and allowing him to lift me to my feet.  
  
  I suddenly became aware at how naked I was, and wrapped my arms over my chest. William’s eyes raked over the length of my body before grabbing my arm and pulling it away from my breasts.  
  
  “Don’t hide yourself from me. ”  
  
  I reluctantly let my hands fall to my sides. I chewed on my lip as my eyes danced over his naked form. He placed his fingers under my chin and tilted my face up to meet his gaze.  
  
  “You are perfect. ”  
  
  My face heated with a blush as I tried to fight back a smile. What had I done to deserve him? He leaned closer, running his lips along my neck up to my ear. I let out a sigh and closed my eyes, letting my head roll to the side to give him better access.  
  
  “Go take your shower before I take you into the bedroom and we don’t get anything done today,” he whispered in my ear. I nodded and he smacked me lightly across the bottom as I turned towards the bathroom. I looked over my shoulder and smiled at him before making my way to the other side of the room.  
  
  The water was hot and felt incredible against my skin. I washed myself twice, lingering in the warmth as long as I could. All of the stress of taking William to meet my aunt washed away. I thought again about my parents, and what they would have said if I’d brought home someone like William.  
  
  Part of me was relieved he had never pressed the issue about them, but part of me wondered why he didn’t want to know about my past. Maybe it was because his was too painful.  
  
  It took us nearly losing each other before he was able to open up and tell me the truth about Abby. I know it was incredibly hard for him. Maybe he was just trying to spare me the pain. It wasn’t a topic I enjoyed reliving, but I wanted to share that part of me with William. I wanted to know everything about him. He must feel the same way.  
  
  I turned off the water and grabbed the oversized white towel that hung on a rack beside the shower. I ran it over my body and secured it around myself before stepping out into the main living area.  
  
  The apartment was filled with the smell of pancakes. I smiled as I caught sight of William standing in front of the stove, dishing the last few flapjacks onto a plate on the island.  
  
  “I thought I was going to have to come in there after you. ” He winked and I couldn’t contain my smile.  
  
  “I couldn’t help myself. It felt so good. ” I took a seat at the island as he placed a stack of pancakes on a plate in front of me.  
  
  “You even make a shower sound sexy,” he joked as he rounded the corner and took a seat next to me.  
  
  “This looks amazing!” I cut up my stack of pancakes and reached for the syrup. William’s hand shot up and pushed it away. I gave him a frustrated glare and reached for it again. He slid it further down the counter and smirked in my direction.  
  
  “Careful. Remember what happened with the sugar. ” His eyes narrowed and I couldn’t help but let out a giggle.  
  
  “I’ll have to remember that for later. We have too much to do today. ” I wanted to get this meeting with Judy over with before I lost my nerve.  
  
  “I’m sorry, Emma. I’m going to have to meet your aunt some other time. ”  
  
  I slumped back into my seat and sat my fork down on my plate, trying unsuccessfully not to pout. William reached over and tucked my damp hair behind my ear.  
  
  “I got a call from my lawyer while you were in the shower. He needs me to look over some paperwork about the Abby incident. It shouldn’t take long, but I think it would be best if we rescheduled the meeting for another day. ”  
  
  I wasn’t mad at William, but I knew if we waited, I would lose my nerve. Introducing him to Judy was a huge step for our relationship. I knew he understood that. He was the one who had asked me to marry him.  
  
  He placed his fingers under my chin and angled my face towards him. “You’re not mad at me, are you?”  
  
  I shook my head and smiled. “Of course not. You take care of what you have to do so we don’t have to worry about Abby anymore. ”  
  
  He nodded once and turned his attention back to his food. “Eat. ”  
  
  I watched him take a few bites before picking up my fork. We ate in silence. I didn’t mind because I was too busy shoving food into my mouth. William was an amazing cook. One of his many talents.  
  
  Chapter Three  
  
  William washed our plates as I retreated to his bedroom to get dressed. I pulled on my favorite pair of ripped jeans and a white tank top. I grabbed a brush from my purse was running it through my hair when I heard the door squeak open behind me. William stood in the doorway leaning against the frame. His eyes raked over my body and I felt my face flush.  
  
  “What?” I asked with a grin as he slowly walked towards me. He stopped just inches from me, his hand reaching out and tracing my jaw.  
  
  “I don’t deserve you. ” His eyes searched mine and I couldn’t help but smile. His hand slipped into my wet hair and pulled my face closer to his. Our lips brushed against each other’s.  
  
  I sucked in a quick breath, the anticipation of touching him grew overwhelming. I leaned forward and kissed him quickly. His fingers knotted in my hair as he moaned into my mouth. My body sagged against his as I parted my lips and let him explore my mouth further.  
  
  His kisses were hungry, and I could feel my lips swelling as his kisses became more demanding. His free hand slipped down my back, trailing along my spine until they reached the waist of my jeans.  
  
  He pulled back, resting his forehead against mine, catching his breath.  
  
  “I have to go. I’ll be back as soon as I can. ”  
  
  I nodded my head against his, my eyes closed, as I tried to recover from his touch. He pulled back slightly and traced my bottom lip with his thumb.  
  
  “I love you, Emma. ” His eyes burned into mine and his words had a direct connection to every part of my body.  
  
  “I love you, William. ” His lips crushed into mine hard. His hand crabbed my ass and pulled me tightly against him. A moan escaped my lips as I felt just how badly he wanted me.  
  
  “Do you have to leave now?” I asked, my eyes glancing up to the ceiling. He smiled devilishly, obviously contemplating taking me to the third floor.  
  
  “I have to do this now. I promise you, we have all the time in the world. ” His forehead fell back against mine as we both took a minute to steady our breathing. His tongue shot out and swiped across his bottom lip. I nearly melted in his arms. “I won’t be long. ”  
  
  I nodded again and swallowed back my desire.  
  
  He kissed me quickly on the cheek and left the bedroom. A moment later, the front door opened and closed, the lock clicking into place behind him.  
  
  I missed him already.  
  
  I made my way into the living room and plopped down on the couch, running my hand over the cushions and smiling. I couldn’t keep the dirty thoughts of last night’s events out of my mind. I sighed and relaxed my head against the cushion. It was getting harder and harder to be away from him. I finally felt like myself.  
  
  After my parents died, I never thought I would feel happiness again. I pushed the thought from my mind. I had someone to share my life with now. I smiled at the idea of William meeting my aunt. My stomach was full of butterflies. It didn’t matter to me what she thought of him, though. I was ready to move on with my life.  
  
  I grabbed the remote and clicked on the television. I flicked through the channels absentmindedly, settling on an old movie. It was just background noise. My thoughts were consumed by William.  
<  
br />   I wanted to know everything about him. I wanted to know what made him smile before Abby had crushed his spirit. I wanted to know everything. I decided to lie down on the couch and let my eyes glaze over as I watched the television.  
  
  The sound of the lock turning startled me and I sat straight up, yawning as I stretched. How long had I been asleep?  
  
  William slipped inside and locked the door behind him. His eyes caught mine and he smiled slightly. He tossed a stack of papers from his lawyer onto the table. I stood and made my way around the couch towards him.  
  
  He took three large strides and his body was against mine. His arms wove around my waist and he lifted me effortlessly against him. My lips found his hungrily. He turned and planted my back hard against the wall, pulling my legs around his hips. I panted in between kisses as his body pushed against mine.  
  
  I ached for his touch. My body craved him like a drug. His fingers dug into my sides and I almost squealed in pain. His hips rotated against me again and the only sound that left me was a moan of pure pleasure. I tossed my head back against the wall and dug my fingers into his muscular shoulders. His lips trailed down my throat hungrily.  
  
  “Tell me you want me, Emma. ” His mouth never stopped moving against my skin.  
  
  “Ohh… I want you. ” I panted as he pushed against me again, moaning as he did. His hand slipped under my shirt and skimmed along my breast. I arched my back approvingly. He was being rough, but I’d be lying if I said his aggressive nature didn’t turn me on. There was something dangerous about William that made him irresistible. His lips found their way to mine again and he released me, his fingers worked quickly to undo my jeans. He slipped them down over my hips as I wiggled to free myself from them. I reached for his belt to undress him, but he grabbed my hands, pushing them above my head. I bucked my hips out toward him, but he moved, not letting me make the connection. His mouth hovered over mine. His lips grazed my cheek as they made their way to my ear. He nibbled gently on my earlobe. My body was set on fire.  
  
  “Please!” I begged. I wanted him against me. My body ached for him to be inside of me. I felt his lips curl into a smile.  
  
  “I love it when you beg. ” His voice was husky and full of lust.  
  
  “Please,” I whispered, letting my eyes flutter closed. His hips found mine again.  
  
  He pulled back from me slightly. His eyes grew serious.  
  
  “I would do anything for you… anything. ”  
  
  I didn’t process a coherent thought. I just needed to feel him against me, inside me. I nodded quickly and his mouth found mine. He grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head in one quick motion. I stood in front of him in only my yellow cotton panties. A growl resonated from deep in his chest. It was so erotic and primal. I began to fumble with the buttons on his shirt, wanting to see his body. He didn’t push my hands away, only smirked slightly as he watched me work. I knew it took a lot for him to give up any of the control.  
  
  I avoided his gaze as I concentrated on getting him as naked as possible. As I reached the final button I pushed the shirt off his shoulders, exposing his deep tribal tattoo that wound its way over his shoulder and down his arm. His eyes danced over my body and I bit my lip, waiting for him to make a move. He grinned and lifted my body against his. He pulled my legs around his waist and I held onto him as he made his way to the bedroom.  
  
  His hands frantically searched my body as he tasted the skin above my breast. I arched my back, pressing myself into him. He moaned and made quick work of undoing his belt. I let my nails slide down his back, feeling his muscles flex under my fingertips.  
  
  “I want you, Emma. I want to possess you,” he groaned. I whimpered at his confession. It made me want him even more. He slipped his jeans over his hips, not bothering to remove them the rest of the way. “Tell me that you’re mine. ”  
  
  “Ahhh…” was all that I could mutter. His lips on my body felt too incredible. His hand slipped up my throat to my jaw and he jerked my face to his.  
  
  “Tell me!” His words were threatening. He ground his hips into mine.  
  
  “I’m yours. Only yours,” I panted. His eyes widened and his fingers slipped between us. He wrapped his fingers in my panties and tugged them, ripping the small scrap of fabric from my body. My hips lifted as I rubbed myself against his hardness. Pleasure shot through me all the way to my toes.

I was fired 1 week after informing my work I needed 2 days off for a early miscarriage. I started having a miscarriage for which I hadn't known I was pregnant on a Tuesday, I informed my employer the following day I would need that Thursday and Friday off to address my needs physically and I would return Monday. They acted sympathetic and when Monday came it was back to business as usual. By Friday AM I wad handed termination papers. They sited reasons as following- ""taking excessive breaks, misuse of company resources, spending excessive time at desk, and lying about reasons for not being in the office."" NONE if this is true. To say I was shocked and insulted was an understatement.  For background story I helped them open the company, I specialize in the industry and the owners had no experience. I trained them and used my connections to get them up and running. 
My title was office manager, not sure where else my job should take place but at my desk. Regardless I spent many days running errands and doing things they only trusted me to do. 
I was a salary employee and generally took s 30-45 minute lunch break daily. I eould come in anywhere between 7:00am and 8:15 am and leave between 4:30pm and 5:30pm, I also worked Saturdays from home as needed. I averaged 43-45 hours a week. I worked more than initially detailed in my job offer weekly. Unlike others who regularly put in 30 hours, coming in at 6am to sleep in their truck for an hour then leaving at 3pm each day. I was the lowest paid employee and the only female, lower paid than men i was training and cleaning up after. As far as misusing company resources that is absolutely insane, i NEVER did such a thing, she then proceeded to ask me about every item i was packing in my box as i was leaving, coffee mugs, headphones  insisted i show her the paper i put in the box (my daughter immunization records) treated me like a thief. It was very bizarre and surprising honestly. The most baffling part is i was given a raise 3 months prior and a quarterly bonus 2 weeks prior. Never was any dissatisfaction expressed on any instance or reviews. I was the only one taking initiative in areas outside of my descibed role including warehouse tasks. The list goes on and on. As I was walking out the door a major issue happened with a vendor and she was looking at me like a puppy who'd just been hit by a car, getting upset when I said I can't help you with this, she said well this is wrap up for your severance. I had to explain this issue happened after I was fired even if only 15 minutes. She calls me from the road 5 minutes later for help to get into the vendor portal, I told her she needs to call the vendor not me. TBH im thinking they planned the whole time for me to just train the wife to do my job. Just a theory but curious if I have a leg to stand on for the timing of everything, raise, bonus , miscarriage, termination with absolutely bogus reasons. ",12,1756602727.0,jobs,10,0.83,False

My title was office manager, not sure where else my job should take place but at my desk. Regardless I spent many days running errands and doing things they only trusted me to do. 
I was a salary employee and generally took s 30-45 minute lunch break daily. I eould come in anywhere between 7:00am and 8:15 am and leave between 4:30pm and 5:30pm, I also worked Saturdays from home as needed. I averaged 43-45 hours a week. I worked more than initially detailed in my job offer weekly. Unlike others who regularly put in 30 hours, coming in at 6am to sleep in their truck for an hour then leaving at 3pm each day. I was the lowest paid employee and the only female, lower paid than men i was training and cleaning up after. As far as misusing company resources that is absolutely insane, i NEVER did such a thing, she then proceeded to ask me aboutv every item i was packing in my box as i was leaving, coffee mugs, headphones  insisted i show her the paper i put in the box (my daughter immunization records) treated me like a thief. It was very bizarre and surprising honestly. The most baffling part is i was given a raise 3 months prior and a quarterly bonus 2 weeks prior. Never was any dissatisfaction expressed on any instance or reviews. I was the only one taking initiative in areas outside of my descibed role including warehouse tasks. The list goes on and on. As I was walking out the door a major issue happened with a vendor and she was looking at me like a puppy who'd just been hit by a car, getting upset when I said I can't help you with this, she said well this is wrap up for your severance. I had to explain this issue happened after I was fired even if only 15 minutes. She calls me from the road 5 minutes later for help to get into the vendor portal, I told her she needs to call the vendor not me. TBH im thinking they planned the whole time for me to just train the wife to do my job. Just a theory but curious if I have a leg to stand on for the timing of everything, raise, bonus , miscarriage, termination with absolutely bogus reasons. ",8,1756602549.0,legaladvice,2,0.91,False

What happened?
What did I do?

I sit on the sidewalk, back against this high rise. It’s cold. The chill creeps up my spine and the flashing streetlights are so bright they’re making me squint. The sounds of the city hit me all at once—blaring horns, the crowded sidewalk. I feel like my senses are amplified, but my body is sluggish.

This spot feels so familiar. I look at the street sign—Crossline Avenue? I’ve never been here before, and yet it feels like I’ve been on this corner a thousand times.

I feel a tap on my shoulder.

“How are we doing today, Mr. Brooks?”

I turn around and see a strange man in a suit.

“Uh… excuse me? Do I know you?”

“Well, you do and you don’t. I am Karon. And how are you feeling today, Mr. Brooks?”

“What do you mean I do and I don’t? Wait—who are you? And how do you know me?”

“I’m an old friend of yours. We go back a long time. But enough of that. Shall we try again?”

“Try what again?” I ask.

“Come with me. Let’s talk.”

I’m confused and disoriented, but get up to follow him.

“It’s right here on the left,” he says.

I open the door to a small white room with a table in the middle and two chairs. I look back at Karon, and he nods for me to go in. The room is spotless, like they just did a deep cleaning ten minutes prior—but with no scent of bleach or lemon.

“Have a seat,” Karon says.

I pull my chair out and see two objects on the table. I squint to make out the wording.

“Coffee or vodka?” Karon asks as he places a chipped mug on the table.

“Um… vodka, please.”

“Sure thing.”

Karon grabs a glass from underneath the table and pours me a drink.

I take the glass and down the vodka, but there’s no taste, no burn.

“Wait, what is this?” I ask.

“It’s vodka. That’s what you asked for, right?”

“Yes, but this doesn’t taste like anything.”

“Well, Mr. Brooks, you’ve had a pretty long night, so maybe that has something to do with it.”

“I don’t remember anything from last night. What happened?”

“You made choices, and now we are here.”

Karon looks at his watch.

“Perfect. We are right on schedule. Follow me.”

I get up to follow him. I’m still dazed and confused, but I feel like I know this man. Do I trust him? He clearly knows me, but I know nothing about him—yet I have this feeling of familiarity.

“Right this way, Mr. Brooks,” he says, holding the door open to another room.

I slowly walk in to see what’s behind the door. Another pale, blank room—this time with two seats, a table, and a stack of papers.

“Have a seat, Mr. Brooks. Would you like some coffee, water, tea?”

“No, I’m fine. Wait… what is this? Where am I?”

“You are where you are, Mr. Brooks. Have a seat, and let’s begin. Are you familiar with a man named Anderson?”

“Uhh… my old boss?”

“Yes, very good, Mr. Brooks. You used to work for a man named Mr. Anderson. What can you tell me about him?”

“Well, I can tell you he wasn’t a fan of mine, that’s for sure.”

“Really? And why do you think that is?”

“I don’t know—you’d have to ask him. I was a great employee. I went above and beyond day after day and never got any recognition, while the slackers I worked with were praised. You know, I actually bought him lunch once? Yeah, he forgot his wallet and I covered the tab, and he had the nerve to fire me a month later.”

“So the firing was unjustified?”

“Completely. He had it out for me. I would get taken aside and nitpicked all the time—nobody else got treated like that. I literally bought lunch for this guy.”

“So you were never late? Insubordinate? Under the influence?”

“What? No?! I mean… sure, we may have drinks once in a while when we take clients out, but nothing inappropriate.”

“I have records that you, on multiple occasions, showed up to work late, intoxicated, and were hostile.”

“That isn’t me. I never did that. I showed up to work early, stayed late, and was one of the best producers in the company. I carried that team. You know, Mr. Anderson always had it out for me—I think he was threatened by me. And to think I helped him numerous times.”

“Interesting. So the reports from Mr. Anderson and multiple coworkers to the police about a violent outburst on August 12, 1993 are false?”

“I had a few drinks—we all did. They set me up. They wanted me gone and they twisted the story. I’m better without them and that company.”

“Fair enough, Mr. Brooks. Fair enough. Will you please follow me?”

I get up to follow him. Who is this guy? An employee of Mr. Anderson’s? Did I work with this guy? Is that why he seems so familiar?

As we walk up to the next door, I stop and ask, “How do we know each other?”

Karon replies, “We are old friends, Mr. Brooks.”

He extends his arm to usher me into the next room. Another pale white room—same look, same feel. In the center of the room is a projector and two seats.

“Have a seat, Mr. Brooks,” Karon says.

I reluctantly take a seat when suddenly the lights turn off and the projector goes on. It’s like a silent movie of a house—wait, that’s my house. It cuts to the next scene: my living room. I can feel the carpet on my feet and smell the coffee in the air.

I start to feel anxious, like I know what’s going to happen next and am bracing for it. There she is—the love of my life. Her beauty leaves me speechless in the moment as I wrestle with my emotions. Seeing her curled up on the couch with a book and a cup of coffee in her favorite mug with a beautiful floral pattern. She loved using that mug, even though there was a chip in it.

I can feel tears starting to form when the projector shuts off and the lights turn on.

“How are you feeling, Mr. Brooks?”

“I feel a lot of things after seeing that.”

“Would you like to share?”

“No.”

“Are you sure?”

“What do you want me to say? That she was the love of my life? That she was perfect?”

“Only if it’s true, Mr. Brooks.”

“Well, she was. We just didn’t work. We didn’t click when we needed to. Our timing was off.”

“Is that what it was, Mr. Brooks? Just bad timing? Nothing more?”

“Yes. Bad timing.”

Karon sits back in his chair and gives me a look as if he’s questioning my next move. Slowly, he pushes the chipped coffee mug toward me. The aroma of the coffee hits me and all the memories rush back—her voice, her smell, her laugh. For a moment, I’m at peace.

“So why did it not work out, Mr. Brooks?” Karon asks in a soft tone.

I sit up straight, eyes fixed on him. My answer comes without hesitation, as if it’s the only truth I’ve ever known.

“It just didn’t work out.”

The lights go out—pitch black. It feels like I’m in a void, caught between time and space, when a small bright light starts to move closer and closer. The light gets so bright I start to squint and feel a tap on my shoulder.

“How are we doing today, Mr. Brooks?”

1n4hr0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1n4hr0o/the_pagan_stone_by_nora_roberts_free_read_online/,The Pagan Stone by Nora Roberts Free Read online,"THE DREAM WOKE HIM AT DAWN, AND THAT WAS A pisser. From experience, Gage knew it would be useless to try to find sleep again with images of burning blood in his brain. The closer it got to July, the closer it got to the Seven, the more vivid and vicious the dreams. He'd rather be awake and doing than struggling with nightmares.  
  
  Or visions.  
  
  He'd come out of the woods that long-ago July with a body that healed itself, and with the gift of sight. Gage didn't consider the precognition wholly reliable. Different choices, different actions, different outcomes.  
  
  Seven years before, come July, he'd turned off the pumps at the Qwik Mart, and had taken the added precaution of locking Coach Moser in a cell. He'd never known, not for certain, if he'd saved his friends' lives by those actions, or if the dream had been just a dream.  
  
  But he'd played the odds.  
  
  He continued to play the odds, Gage supposed as he grabbed a pair of boxers in case he wasn't alone in the house. He was back, as he was every seventh year. And this time he'd thrown his lot in with the three women who'd turned his, Fox's, and Cal 's trio into a team of six.  
  
  With Cal engaged to Quinn Black-blond bombshell and paranormal writer-she often spent the night at Cal 's. Hence the inadvisability of wandering downstairs naked to make coffee. But Cal 's attractive house in the woods felt empty to Gage, of people, of ghosts, of Cal 's big, lazy dog, Lump. And that was all to the good, as Gage preferred solitude, at least until after coffee.  
  
  He assumed Cal had spent the night at the house the three women rented in town. As Fox had done the headfirst into love with the sexy brunette Layla Darnell, they might've bunked at the house, or Fox's apartment over his law offices. Either way, they'd stay close, and with Fox's talent for pushing into thoughts, they had ways of communicating that didn't require phones.  
  
  Gage put coffee on, then went out to stand on the deck while it brewed.  
  
  Leave it to Cal, he thought, to build his home on the edge of the woods where their lives had turned inside out. But that was Cal for you-he was the type who took a stand, kept right on standing. And the fact was, if country charm rang your bell, this was the spot for it. The green woods with the last of the spring's wild dogwoods and mountain laurel gleaming in slants of sunlight offered a picture of tranquility-if you didn't know any better. The terraced slope in front of the house exploded with color from shrubs and ornamental trees, while at the base the winding creek bubbled along.  
  
  It fit Cal to the ground, just as his lady did. For himself, Gage figured the country quiet would drive him crazy within a month.  
  
  He went back for the coffee, drank it strong and black. He took a second mug up with him. By the time he'd showered and dressed, restlessness nipped at him. He tried to quell it with a few hands of solitaire, but the house was too. . . settled. Grabbing his keys, he headed out. He'd hunt up his friends, and if nothing was going on, maybe he'd zip up to Atlantic City for the day and find some action.  
  
  It was a quiet drive, but then the Hollow was a quiet place, a splat on the map in the rolling western Maryland countryside that got itself juiced up for the annual Memorial Day parade, the Fourth of July fireworks in the park, the occasional Civil War reenactment. And, of course, the madness that flowed into it every seven years.  
  
  Overhead, the trees arched over the road; beside it, the creek wound. Then the view opened to rolling, rock-pocked hills, distant mountains, and a sky of delicate spring blue. It wasn't his place, not the rural countryside nor the town tucked into it. Odds were he'd die here, but even that wouldn't make it his. And still, he'd play the long shot that he, his friends, and the women with them would not only survive, but beat down the thing that plagued the Hollow. That they would end it this time.  
  
  He passed the Qwik Mart where foresight or luck had won the day, then the first of the tidy houses and shops along Main. He spotted Fox's truck outside the townhouse that held Fox's home and law office. The coffee shop and Ma's Pantry were both open for business, serving the breakfast crowd. A hugely pregnant woman towing a toddler stepped out of the bakery with a large white bag. The kid talked a mile a minute while Mom waddled down Main.  
  
  There was the empty gift shop Fox's Layla had rented with plans to open a fashion boutique. The idea made Gage shake his head as he turned at the Square. Hope sprang, he supposed, and love gave it a hell of a boost.  
  
  He gave a quick glance at the Bowl-a-Rama, town institution and Cal 's legacy. And looked away again. Once upon a time he'd lived above the bowling center with his father, lived with the stench of stale beer and cigarettes, with the constant threat of fists or belt.  
  
  Bill Turner still lived there, still worked at the center, reputedly five years sober. Gage didn't give a flying fuck, as long as the old man kept his distance. Because the thought burned in his gut, he shut it down, tossed it aside.  
  
  At the curb, he pulled up behind a Karmann Ghia-property of one Cybil Kinski, the sixth member of the team. The sultry gypsy shared his precog trait-just as Quinn shared Cal's ability to look back, and Layla shared Fox's reading of what was hidden in the now. He supposed that made them partners of sorts, and the supposing made him wary.  
  
  She was a number, all right, he thought as he started up the walk to the house. Smart, savvy, and sizzling. Another time, another place, it might've been entertaining to deal a few hands with her, see who walked away the winner. But the idea that some outside force, ancient powers, and magic plots played a part in bringing them together had Gage opting to fold his hand early.  
  
  It was one thing for both Cal and Fox to get twisted up with their women. He just wasn't wired for the long-term deal. Instinct told him that even the short-term with a woman like Cybil would be too complicated for his taste and style.  
  
  He didn't knock. They used the rental house and Cal 's as bases of sorts, so he didn't see the need. Music drifted-something New Agey-all flutes and gongs. He turned toward the source, and there was Cybil. She wore loose black pants and a top that revealed a smooth, tight midriff and sleekly muscled arms. Her wild black curls spilled out of their restraining band.  
  
  The toes of her bare feet sported bright pink polish.  
  
  As he watched, she braced her head on the floor while her body lifted up. Her legs spread, held perpendicular to the floor, then somehow twisted, as if her torso were a hinge. Fluidly, she lowered one leg until her foot was flat on the floor, forming her into some erotic bridge. With movements that seemed effortless, she shifted herself, tucking one leg against her hip while the other cocked up behind her. And reaching back, she gripped her foot to bring it to the back of her head.  
  
  He considered the fact that he didn't drool a testament to his massive power of will.  
  
  She bent, twisted, flowed, arranged herself into what should have been impossible positions. His willpower wasn't so massive he didn't imagine that any woman that flexible would be amazing in bed.  
  
  She'd arched back, foot hooked behind her head when a flicker in those deep, dark eyes told him she'd become aware of him.  
  
  ""Don't let me interrupt. ""  
  
  ""I won't. I'm nearly done. Go away. ""  
  
  Though he regretted missing how she ended such a session, he wandered back to the kitchen, poured himself a cup of coffee. Leaning back on the counter, he noted the morning paper was folded on the little table, the dog bowl Cal left there for Lump was empty, and the water bowl beside it half full. The dog might've already had breakfast, but if anyone else had, the dishes had already been stowed away. Since the news didn't interest him at the moment, he sat and dealt out a hand of solitaire. He was on his fourth game when Cybil strolled in.  
  
  ""Aren't you a rise-and-shiner this morning. ""  
  
  He laid a red eight on a black nine. "" Cal still in bed?""  
  
  ""It seems everyone's up and about. Quinn hauled him off to the gym. "" She poured coffee for herself, then reac  
hed in the bread bin. ""Bagel?""  
  
  ""Sure. ""  
  
  After cutting one neatly in half, she dropped it in the toaster. ""Bad dream?"" She angled her head when he glanced up at her. ""I had one, woke me at first light. So did Cal and Quinn. I haven't heard, but I imagine Fox and Layla-they're at his place-got the same wake-up call. Quinn's remedy, weights and machines. Mine, yoga. Yours. . . "" She gestured to the cards.  
  
  ""Everybody's got something. ""  
  
  ""We kicked our Big Evil Bastard in the balls a few days ago. We have to expect him to kick back. ""  
  
  ""Nearly got ourselves incinerated for the trouble,"" Gage reminded her.  
  
  ""Nearly works for me. We put the three pieces of the bloodstone back together, magickally. We performed a blood ritual. "" She studied the healing cut across her palm. ""And we lived to tell the tale. We have a weapon. ""  
  
  ""Which we don't know how to use. ""  
  
  ""Does it know?"" She busied herself getting out plates, cream cheese for the bagels. ""Does our demon know any more about it than we do? Giles Dent infused that stone with power more than three hundred years ago in the clearing, and-theoretically-used it as part of the spell that pulled the demon, in its form as Lazarus Twisse, into some sort of limbo where Dent could hold it for centuries. ""  
  
  Handily, she sliced an apple, arranged the pieces on a plate while she spoke. ""Twisse didn't know or recognize the power of the bloodstone then, or apparently hundreds of years later when your boyhood ritual released it, and the stone was split into three equal parts. If we follow that logic, it doesn't know any more about it now, which gives us an advantage. We may not know, yet, how it works, but we know it does. ""  
  
  Turning, she offered him his plated bagel. ""We put the three pieces into one again. The Big Evil Bastard isn't the only one with power here. ""  
  
  Just a bit fascinated, Gage watched Cybil cut her half bagel in half before spreading what he could only describe as a film of cream cheese over the two quarters. While he loaded his own half, she sat and took a bite he estimated consisted of about half a dozen crumbs.  
  
  ""Maybe you should just look at a picture of food instead of going to all the trouble to fix it. "" When she only smiled, took another minuscule bite, he said, ""I've seen Twisse kill my friends. I've seen that countless times, in countless ways. ""  
  
  Her eyes met his, dark with understanding. ""That's the bitch of our precog, seeing the potentials, the possibilities, in brutal Technicolor. I was afraid when we went into the clearing to perform the ritual. Not just of dying, though I don't want to die. In fact, I'm firmly against it. I was afraid of living and watching the people closest to me die, and worse, somehow being responsible for it. ""  
  
  ""But you went in. ""  
  
  ""We went in. "" She chose an apple slice, took a stingy bite. ""And we didn't die. Not all dreams, not all visions are. . . set in stone. You come back, every Seven, you come back. ""  
  
  ""We swore an oath. ""  
  
  ""Yes, when you were ten. I'm not discounting the validity or the power of childhood oaths,"" she continued, ""but you'd come back regardless. You come back for them, for Cal and Fox. I came for Quinn, so I understand the strength of friendship. We're not like them, you and I. ""  
  
  ""No?""  
  
  ""No. "" Lifting her coffee, she sipped slowly. ""The town, the people in it, they're not ours. For Cal and Fox-and now in a very real sense for Quinn and Layla-this is home. People go to great lengths to protect home. For me, Hawkins Hollow is just a place I happen to be. Quinn's my home, and now so is Layla. And by extension, by connection, so are Cal and Fox. And so, it seems, are you. I won't leave my home until I know it's safe. Otherwise, while I'd find all this fascinating and intriguing, I wouldn't shed blood for it. ""  
  
  The sun beamed in the kitchen window, haloed over her hair, set the little silver hoops at her ears glinting. ""I think you might. ""  
  
  ""Really?""  
  
  ""Yeah, because the whole thing pisses you off. Wanting to kick its ass weighs on the side of you staying, seeing it through. ""  
  
  She took another tiny bite of bagel and smiled at him. ""Got me. So here we are, Turner, two pairs of itchy feet planted for love and general pissiness. Well. I want my shower,"" she decided. ""Would you mind staying at least until Quinn and Cal get back? Ever since Layla had her 'snakes in the bathroom' event, I've been leery about showering when I'm alone in the house. ""  
  
  ""No problem. You going to eat the rest of that?""  
  
  Cybil pushed the untouched quarter bagel toward him. As she rose to go to the sink to rinse out her coffee mug, he studied the black-and-blue cloud on the back of her shoulder. It reminded him they'd taken a beating on the night of the full moon at the Pagan Stone, and that she-unlike Cal, Fox, and himself-didn't heal within moments of an injury.  
  
  ""That's a bad bruise on your shoulder there. ""  
  
  She shrugged it. ""You should see my ass. ""  
  
  ""Okay. ""  
  
  With a laugh, she glanced over her shoulder. ""Rhetorically speaking. I had a nanny who believed that a good paddling built character. Every time I sit down I'm reminded of her. ""  
  
  ""You had a nanny?""  
  
  ""I did. But paddling aside, I like to think I built my own character. Cal and Quinn should be back soon. You might want to make another pot of coffee. ""  
  
  As she walked out he gave the ass in question a contemplative study. Top of the line, he decided. She was an interesting, and to his mind, complicated mix in a very tidy package. While he had a fondness for tidy packages, he preferred simple contents when it came to fun and games. But for life and death, he thought Cybil Kinski was just what the doctor ordered.  
  
  She'd brought a gun along on their hike to the Pagan Stone. A little pearl-handled. 22, which she'd used with the cold, calculated skill of a veteran mercenary. She'd been the one to do the research on the blood rituals-and she'd done the genealogies that had proven she, Quinn, and Layla were descendants of the demon known as Lazarus Twisse and Hester Deale, the girl it had raped over three centuries before.  
  
  And the woman could cook. Bitched about it, Gage mused as he rose to put on another pot of coffee, but she knew her way around the kitchen. He respected the fact that she generally said what was on her mind, and kept a cool head in a crisis. This was no weak-kneed female needing to be rescued.  
  
  She smelled like secrets and tasted like warm honey.  
  
  He'd kissed her that night in the clearing. Of course, he'd thought they were all about to die in a supernatural blaze and it had been a what-the-hell kind of gesture. But he remembered exactly how she'd tasted.  
  
  Probably not smart to think about it-or to think about the fact that she was upstairs right now, wet and naked. But a guy had to have some entertainment during a break from fighting ancient evil. And strangely, he was no longer in the mood for Atlantic City.  
  
  He heard the front door open, and the quick burst of Quinn's bawdy laughter. As far as Gage could see, Cal had hit the jackpot in Quinn for the laugh alone. Then you added in the curvy body, the big baby blues, the brain, the humor, the guts, and his friend rang all the bells, blew all the whistles.  
  
  Gage topped off his coffee, and hearing only Cal 's foot-steps approach, got down another mug.  
  
  Cal took the mug Gage held out, said, ""Hey,"" then opened the refrigerator for milk.  
  
  For a man who'd likely been up since dawn, Cal looked pretty damn chipper, Gage noted. Exercise might release endorphins, but if Gage was a betting man-and he was-he'd put money on the woman putting the spring in his friend's step.  
  
  Cal 's gray eyes were clear, his face and body relaxed. His dark blond hair was damp and he smelled of soap, indicating he'd showered at the gym. He doctored his coffee, then took a box of Mini-Wheats out of a cupboard.  
  
  ""Want?""  
  
  ""No. ""  
  
  With a grunt, Cal shook cereal into a bowl, dumped in milk. ""Team dream?""  
  
  ""Seems like. ""  
  
  ""Talked to Fox. "" Cal ate his cereal as he leaned back against the counter. ""He and Layla had one, too. Yours?""  
  
  ""The town was bleeding,  
"" Gage began. ""The buildings, the streets, anyone unlucky enough to be outside. Blood bubbling up from the sidewalks, raining down the buildings. And burning while it bled. ""  
  
  ""Yeah, that's the one. It's the first time the six of us shared the same nightmare, that I know of. That has to mean something. ""  
  
  ""The bloodstone's back in one piece. The six of us put it back together. Cybil puts a lot of store in the stone as a power source. ""  
  
  ""And you?""  
  
  ""I guess I'd have to agree, for what it's worth. What I do know is we've got less than two months to figure it out. If that. ""  
  
  Cal nodded. ""It's coming faster, it's coming stronger. But we've hurt it, Gage, twice now we've hurt it bad. ""  
  
  ""Third time better be the charm. ""  
  
  HE DIDN'T HANG AROUND. IF ROUTINE HELD, THE women would spend a good chunk of the day looking for answers in books and on the Internet. They'd review their charts, maps, and graphs, trying to find some new angle. And talking it all to death. Cal would head over to the Bowl-a-Rama, and Fox would open his office for the day. And he, Gage thought, was a gambler without a game.  
  
  So he had the day free.  
  
  He could head back to Cal 's, make some calls, write some e-mails. He had his own research lines to tug. He'd been studying and poking into demonology and folklore for years, and in odd corners of the world. When they combined his data with what Cybil, Quinn, and Layla had dug up, it meshed fairly well.  
  
  Gods and demons warring with each other long before man came to be. Whittling the numbers down so that when man crawled onto the scene, he soon outnumbered them. The time of man, Giles Dent had called it, according to the journals written by his lover, Ann Hawkins. And in the time of man only one demon and one guardian remained-not that he was buying that one, Gage thought. But there was only one who held his personal interest. Mortally wounded, the guardian passed his power and his mission to a young human boy, and so the line continued through the centuries until there was Giles Dent.  
  
  Gage considered it as he drove. He accepted Dent, accepted that he and his friends were Dent's descendants through Ann Hawkins. He believed, as did the others, that Dent found a way, twisting the rules to include a little human sacrifice, to imprison the demon, and himself. Until hundreds of years later, three boys released it.  
  
  He could even accept that the act had been their destiny. He didn't have to like it, but he could swallow it. It was their Fate to face it, fight it, to destroy it or die trying. Since the ghost of Ann Hawkins had made a few appearances this time out, her cryptic remarks indicated this Seven was the money shot.  
  
  All or nothing. Life or death.  
  
  Since most of his visions featured death, in various unpleasant forms, Gage wasn't putting money on the group victory dance.  
  
  He supposed he'd driven to the cemetery because death was on his mind. When he got out of the car, he thrust his hands into his pockets. It was stupid to come here, he thought. It was pointless. But he began to walk across the grass, around the stones and monuments.  
  
  He should've brought flowers, he thought, then immediately shook his head. Flowers were pointless, too. What good did flowers do the dead?  
  
  His mother and the child she'd tried to bring into the world were both long dead.  
  
  May had greened the grass and the trees, and the breeze stirred the green. The ground rolled, gentle slopes and dips where somber gray markers or faithful white monuments rose, and the sun cast their shadows. His mother and his sister who'd died inside her had a white marker. Though it had been years, many years, since he'd walked this way, he knew where to find them.  
  
  The single stone was very simple, small, rounded, with only names and dates carved.

  He barely remembered her, he thought. Time simply rubbed the images, the sounds, the feel of her to a faded blur. He had only the vaguest memory of her laying his hand against her swollen belly so he could feel the baby kick. He had a picture, so he knew he favored his mother in coloring, in the shape of his eyes, his mouth. He'd never seen the baby, and no one had ever told him what she looked like. But he remembered being happy, remembered playing with trucks in the sunsplash through a window. And yes, even of running to the door when his father came home from work, and screaming with fun as those hands lifted him up high.  
  
  There'd been a time, a brief time, when his father's hands had lifted him instead of knocking him down. The sun-splashed time, he supposed. Then she'd died, and the baby with her, and everything had gone dark and cold.  
  
  Had she ever shouted at him, punished him, been impatient? Surely, she must have. But he couldn't remember any of that, or chose not to. Maybe he'd idealized her, but what was the harm? When a boy had a mother for such a brief time, the man was entitled to think of her as perfect.  
  
  ""I didn't bring flowers,"" he murmured. ""I should have. ""  
  
  ""But you came. ""  
  
  He spun around, and looked into eyes the same color, the same shape as his own. As his heart squeezed, his mother smiled at him.

Chapter Two  
  
  SHE'S SO YOUNG. THAT WAS HIS FIRST THOUGHT. Younger, he realized, than he as they stood studying each other over her grave. She had a calm and quiet beauty, a kind of simplicity he thought would have kept her beautiful into old age. But she hadn't lived to see thirty.  
  
  And even now, a grown man, he felt something inside him ache with that loss.  
  
  ""Why are you here?"" he asked her, and her smile bloomed again.  
  
  ""Don't you want me to be?""  
  
  ""You never came before. ""  
  
  ""Maybe you never looked before. "" She shook her dark hair back, breathed deep. ""It's such a pretty day, all this May sunshine. And here you are, looking so lost, so angry. So sad. Don't you believe there's a better place, Gage? That death is the beginning of the next?""  
  
  ""It was the end of before, for me. "" That, he supposed, was the black and white of it. ""When you died, so did the better. ""  
  
  ""Poor little boy. Do you hate me for leaving you?""  
  
  ""You didn't leave me. You died. ""  
  
  ""It amounts to the same. "" There was sorrow in her eyes, or perhaps it was pity. ""I wasn't there for you, and did worse than leave you alone. I left you with him. I let him plant death inside me. So you were alone, and helpless, with a man who beat you and cursed you. ""  
  
  ""Why did you marry him?""  
  
  ""Women are weak, you must have learned that by now. If I hadn't been weak I would have left him, taken you and left him and this place. "" She turned, just a bit, so she looked back toward the Hollow. There was something else in her eyes now-he caught a glint of it-something brighter than pity. ""I should have protected you and myself. We would have had a life together, away from here. But I can protect you now. ""  
  
  He watched the way she moved, the way her hair fell, the way the grass stirred at her feet. ""How do the dead protect the living?""  
  
  ""We see more. We know more. "" She turned back to him, held out her hands. ""You asked why I was here. I'm here for that. To protect you, as I didn't during life. To save you. To tell you to go, go away from here. Leave this place. There's nothing but death and misery here, pain and loss. Go and live. Stay and you'll die, you'll rot in the ground as I am. ""  
  
  ""Now see, you were doing pretty well up till then. "" The rage inside him was cold, and it was fierce, but his voice was casual as a shrug. ""I might've bought it if you'd played more Mommy and Me cards. But you rushed it. ""  
  
  ""I only want you safe. ""  
  
  ""You want me dead. If not dead, at least gone. I'm not going anywhere, and you're not my mother. So take off the dress, asshole. ""  
  
  ""Mommy's going to have to spank you for that. "" With a wave of its hand the demon blasted the air. The force knocked Gage off his feet. Even as he gained them, it was changing.  
  
  Its eyes went red, and shed bloody tears as it howled with laughter. ""Bad boy! I'm going to punish you the most of all the bad boys. Flay your skin, drink your blood, gnaw your bones. ""  
  
  ""Yeah, yeah, yeah. "" In a show of indifference, Gage hooked his thumbs in his front pockets.  
  
  The face of his mother melted away into something hideous, something inhuman. The body bunched, the back humping, the hands and feet curling into claws, then sharpening into hooves. Then the mass of it twisted into a writhing formless black that choked the air with the stink of death.  
  
  The wind blew the stench into Gage's face, but he planted his feet and stood. He had no weapon, and after a quick calculation, decided to play the odds. He bunched his hand into a fist and punched it into the fetid black.  
  
  The burn was amazing. He wrenched his hand free, jabbed again. Pain stole his breath, so he sucked more of it and struck out a third time. It screamed. Fury, Gage thought. He recognized pure fury even when he was flying over his mother's gravestone and slamming hard to the ground.  
  
  It stood over him now, stood atop the gravestone in the form of the young boy it so often selected. ""You'll beg for death,"" it told him. ""Long after I've torn the others to bits, you'll beg. I will dine on you for years. ""  
  
  Gage swiped blood from his mouth, smiled, though a wave of nausea rolled over him. ""Wanna bet?""  
  
  The thing that looked like a boy dug its hands into its own chest, ripped it open. On a mad roll of laughter, it vanished.  
  
  ""Fucking crazy. The son of a bitch is fucking crazy. "" He sat a moment, catching his breath, studying his hand. It was raw and red with blisters, pus seeping from them and the shallow punctures he thought came from fangs. He could feel it healing as the pain was awesome. Cradling his arm, he got to his feet and swayed as dizziness rocked the ground under him.  
  
  He had to sit again, his back braced on the gravestone of his mother and sister, until the sickness passed, until the world steadied. In the pretty May sunshine, with only the dead for company, he breathed his way through the pain, focused his mind on the healing. As the burning eased, his system settled again.  
  
  Rising, he took one last look at the grave, then turned and walked away.  
  
  HE STOPPED BY THE FLOWER POT AND BOUGHT A splashy spring arrangement that had Amy, who worked the counter, speculating on who the lucky lady might be. He left her speculating. It was too hard to explain-and none of Amy's damn business-that he had flowers and mothers on the brain.  
  
  That was one of the problems-and in his mind they were legion-with small towns. Everybody wanted to know everything about everyone else, or pretend they did. When they didn't know enough, they were just as likely to make it up and call it God's truth.  
  
  There were plenty in the Hollow who'd whispered and muttered about him. Poor kid, bad boy, troublemaker, bad news, good riddance. Maybe it had stung off and on, and maybe that sting had gone deep when he'd been younger. But he'd had what he supposed he could call a balm. He'd had Cal and Fox. He'd had family.  
  
  His mother was gone, and had been for a very long time. That, he thought as he drove out of town, had certainly come home to him today. So he'd make a gesture long overdue.  
  
  Of course, she might not be home. Frannie Hawkins didn't hold a job outside the home-exactly. Her work was her home, and the various committees she chaired or participated in. If there was a committee, society, or organization in the Hollow, it was likely Cal 's mother had a hand in it.  
  
  He pulled up behind the clean and tidy car he recognized as hers in the drive of the tidy house where the Hawkinses had lived as long as Gage remembered. And the tidy woman who ran the house knelt on a square of bright pink foam as she planted-maybe they were petunias-at the edges of her already impressive front-yard garden.  
  
  Her hair was a glossy blond under a wide-brimmed straw hat, and her hands were covered with sturdy brown gloves. He imagined she thought of her navy pants and pink T-shirt as work clothes. She turned her head at the sound of the car, then her pretty face lit with a smile when she saw Gage.  
  
  That was, always had been, a small wonder to him. That she smiled, and meant it, when she saw him. She tugged off her gloves as she rose. ""What a nice surprise. And look at those flowers! They're almost as gorgeous as you are. ""  
  
  ""Coals to Newcastle. ""  
  
  She touched his cheek, then took the offered flowers. ""I can never have too many flowers. Let's go in so I can put them in water. ""  
  
  ""I interrupted you. ""  
  
  ""Gardening is a constant work in progress. I can't stop fiddling. ""  
  
  The house was the same for her, he knew. She upholstered, sewed, painted, made crafty little arrangements. And still the house was always warm, always welcoming, never set and stiff.  
  
  She led him back through the kitchen and into the laundry room where, being Frannie Hawkins, she had a sink for the specific purpose of flower arranging. ""I'm just going to put these in a holding vase, then get us something cold to drink. ""  
  
  ""I don't want to hold you up. ""  
  
  ""Gage. "" She waved off his protest as she got down a holding vase, filled it. ""Go, sit out back on the patio. It's too pretty to be inside. I'll bring us out some iced tea. ""  
  
  He did as  
she asked, mostly because he needed to figure out exactly what he'd come here to say to her, and how he wanted to say it. She'd been busy in the back garden as well, and with her container pots. All the color, the shapes, the textures seemed somehow magically perfect and completely natural. He knew, because he'd seen her, that she routinely sketched out her plans for her beds, her pots every year.  
  
  Unlike Fox's mother, Frannie Hawkins absolutely never allowed other hands to weed. She trusted no one to tug out bindweed instead of petunias, or whatever. But he'd hauled his share of mulch for her over the years, his share of rocks. He supposed, in some way, that made her magazine-cover gardens his, in a very limited sense.  
  
  She stepped out. There was iced tea with sprigs of mint in a fat green glass pitcher, the tall coordinating glasses, and a plate of cookies. They sat at her shaded table, looking out over trim grass and flowing flowers.  
  
  ""I always remember this backyard,"" he told her. ""Fox's farm was like Adventure World, and this was. . . ""  
  
  She laughed. ""What? Cal 's mom's obsession?""  
  
  ""No. Somewhere between fairyland and sanctuary. ""  
  
  Her smile faded into quiet warmth. ""What a lovely thing to say. ""  
  
  He knew what he wanted to say, Gage realized. ""You always let me in. I was thinking about things today. You and Fox's mother, you always let me in. You never once turned me away. ""  
  
  ""Why in the world would I?""  
  
  He looked at her then, into her pretty blue eyes. ""My father was a drunk, and I was a troublemaker. ""  
  
  ""Gage. ""  
  
  ""If Cal or Fox had trouble, I probably started it. ""  
  
  ""I think they started plenty of their own and dragged you into that. ""  
  
  ""You and Jim, you made sure I had a roof over my head-and you made it clear I could have this one, I could have yours whenever I needed it. You kept my father on at the center, even when you should've let him go, and you did that for me. But you never made me feel like it was charity. You and Fox's parents, you made sure I had clothes, shoes, work so I had spending money. And you never made me feel it was because you felt sorry for that poor Turner kid. ""  
  
  ""I never thought of you, and I don't imagine Jo Barry ever thought of you, as 'that poor Turner kid. ' You were, and are, the son of my friend. Your mother was my friend, Gage. ""  
  
  ""I know. Still, you could've discouraged Cal from hanging out with me. A lot of people would have. I'm the one who had the idea of going into the woods that night. ""  
  
  The look she gave him was pure mother. ""And neither one of them had anything to do with it?""  
  
  ""Sure, but it was my idea, and you probably figured that out twenty years ago. You still kept the door open for me. ""  
  
  ""None of that was your fault. I don't know a lot of what you're doing now, the six of you, what you've discovered, what you plan to do. Cal keeps a lot of it from me. I guess I let him. But I know enough to be certain what happened at the Pagan Stone when the three of you were boys wasn't your fault. And I know without the three of you, and all you've done, all you've risked, I wouldn't be sitting here on my patio on this pretty day in May. There'd be no Hawkins Hollow without you, Gage. Without you, Cal, and Fox, this town would be dead. ""  
  
  She laid a hand over his, squeezed. ""I'm so proud of you. ""  
  
  With her, maybe particularly with her, he couldn't be less than honest. ""I'm not here for the town. ""  
  
  ""I know. For some odd reason, it only makes me prouder that you're here. You're a good man, Gage. You are,"" she said, with some heat when she saw the denial on his face. ""You'll never convince me otherwise. You've been the best of friends to my son. You've been the best of brothers. My door isn't just open to you. This is your home, whenever you need it.

It made me start to think of all the things I'd manifested in the past before I knew who Neville was and what the whole concept of manifestation is. By doing so, it gave me such an eye opening experience. I realized how effortless it is to manifest. I had been manifesting before I even knew what it was. I am so happy to have found subs like this and other things online. However, I think it can be easy to start to over complicate it in our heads as we learn more about the law. I hope that this story helps anyone who is confused, lost, or struggling with their journey. Remembering it helped me with my current journeys and desires.

  
A few years ago, I had just gotten a new job as a coffee barista. During my first week of training, I was with another new hire as well. I immediately wanted to be friends with her so that our training and work experience could be fun. I introduced myself and tried making conversation with her. She showed zero interest in being my friend. She was short, cold, and very vague with me. She never initiated conversation, smiled, laughed, etc.

I refused to accept this. But here's the thing... this refusal had zero emotion. Let me explain. I knew who I was/am. I knew that I am funny, a good friend, a good coworker, reliable, hard working, and worth being around. I GENUINELY felt this way about myself. My coworker's negative reaction to me had ZERO affect on my self concept. She could have told me to my face that she didn't like me, and my opinion of myself still would not have budged.

  
I observed behavior that I did not prefer and CALMLY thought, ""Nope, this isn't what I want,"" and I left it at that. Everyday that I clocked in, I stayed TRUE to MYSELF. I naturally showed the qualities that I believed to be true about myself. I made jokes even if she did not laugh. I never expected her to laugh, nor did I check to see if she laughed. I KNEW I was funny. Therefore, my humor HAD to be noticed. I worked hard, I was reliable when we were busy, I was kind, helpful, etc. I DID NOT do these things to get a response out of her. I never once tried to change her. I did not think, ""Man... maybe I'm annoying,"" or ""What's wrong with me? Why won't she like me?"" I just showed up everyday being my authentic self without checking the 3D, letting it get me down, having it affect the positive views I had about myself, etc.

  
I don't know when, because I wasn't paying attention to the how or the when, but she out of nowhere started to open up. She laughed at my jokes, she initiated conversation, she acted excited to see me, and as we hired more people, she favored me over the rest. TO THIS DAY, we are close friends. We talk, like each other's posts, have our own inside jokes, etc. I have babysat her daughter and hung out with her on many occasions. Some might say she was naturally drawn to my positive traits and it was bound to happen. Sure... BUT... what if I had let her negative behaviors affect me? If I had let her coldness get to me, I might have joked less, been clumsy around her because I was nervous, avoided taking shifts with her, etc. My reality would have turned out much different had I let the 3D affect me.

  
**Here is a breakdown:**

  
1. I had a solid, positive belief system about myself from the get go. 

2. I observed a circumstance that I did not prefer and decided not to accept it as fact.

3. The ""feeling"" of the wish fulfilled was mostly just me knowing that how I felt about myself HAD to be seen and felt by others.

4. I never checked the 3D or allowed it to shift my emotions and opinions about myself if it was still not something I preferred.

5. I never cared about the how, when, or why.

6. I was not surprised whenever she finally came around and started appearing as the version I preferred. Of course she enjoyed me as a coworker. Of course she wanted to be my friend.

7. I did not try to change her. None of my actions were for her. I lived and worked effortlessly, doing what felt right and true to myself. I did not make jokes for her approval. I made jokes because *I* liked to be funny. I did not work extra hard to convince her I was reliable. I worked hard because that is just who I am. 

8. I did not let this consume my thoughts. I lived my life everyday without thinking about it at all. 

  
I feel like this story can be applied to a lot of other stories. It is so simple, yet whenever I reflect on it, I realize how verbatim it applies to the law. ",14,1756602408.0,NevilleGoddard,0,0.9,False

She's fine as fuck. But the East Coast, old money, wealthy kind of classy fine. Not, like, bar honey, ring bunny sexy, or even model hot, or movie star gorgeous, or porn star fuckable. She's...one in a million. An actual factual motherfuckin' angel from heaven.  
  
  Evangeline du Maurier is...god, I don't have the words. She's a lady. Not a chick, not a honey, not a babe, or a dame, or any of that vaguely condescending, objectifying terminology. She's a goddamn lady.  
  
  I suppose a thorough description is in order.  
  
  Five-eight, five-seven. A true hourglass shape, as in she probably has a literal set of 36-24-36 measurements--I feel compelled, for the sake of honesty, to point out here that measurements and sizes and whatever else don't define a woman to me. I'm just saying, those are Evangeline's measurements by my estimation, and she fuckin' rocks the look so hard it makes me dizzy. Her hair is jet black, so black it shimmers and glints and gleams, thick and long and loose, pulled around the back of her neck to hang down her left shoulder. Green eyes, the shade of a maple leaf in the summer sun. Tanned skin, but naturally tan, not fake or spray tan. A combination of a lot of time in the sun and a natural caramel hint to her skin.  
  
  Sharp, exotic, symmetrical facial features, plump lips in a perfect cupid's bow. Not a lot of makeup as far as I can tell, nor a lot of jewelry. A pair of round diamond studs in her ears, a full carat at least, a bracelet with little charms and shit dangling from it, and a fine platinum chain with a tiny key pendant, a single chocolate diamond in the center of the head of the key. Her clothes look expensive, and I'm pretty sure her purse and shoes should be insured.  
  
  Money.  
  
  But understated money, not flashy look how rich I am money.  
  
  And right now, she's just barely on her feet, leaned back against the wall of a closed bakery a block from the bar, gasping for breath, hyperventilating. She's got blood spattered across her face and clumping in her hair, there's blood dotting her forehead and hairline and down across her nose and chin. It's all a result of that punch I threw to lay out McDermott. An asshole move, I admit; I punched the fucker that way on purpose, knowing the splatter would hit her. I mean, it was obvious she'd wandered into the wrong end of town by accident, but she was staring at me like she'd never seen a real man before, and looked disgusted at what she'd probably term a vulgar display of brutality or some fancy, Hah-vahd educated highfalutin bullshit like that. She's got a bit of an East Coast lilt to her voice. Arch, crisp, educated, and formal.  
  
  She's a good girl.  
  
  A virgin even, maybe.  
  
  But then again, the way she looked at me? Maybe not. I don't know. I can usually sniff out and avoid virgins as if I'm a bloodhound, but this woman is so far outside my realm of understanding that I don't even know how to read her.  
  
  Her shirt is all bloody. It's ivory or cream colored--words for not-quite white, but almost, in my understanding--and it's sexy as fuck. Figure-hugging silk, a deep V-neck exposing a good bit of cleavage, sleeveless. Again, classy and sexy, expensive looking without being in-your-face. Her hands are shaking, trembling like crazy. There are dirty handprints on her shirt, from those fuckin' assholes. I really do hope brother Zane takes care of them properly, as they deserve.  
  
  I still have her hand in mine. I just kissed the back of her hand, like a storybook knight. Felt stupid doing it, but it got her eyes on mine, and her teeth caught at her lower lip, and her struggle to breathe seemed to intensify momentarily, and then she sucked in a sharp breath and yanked her eyes away from mine.  
  
  She'd said she trusted me; time to make good on that. I take her other hand in mine and lift her to her feet. ""Come on. Let's get you that drink.""  
  
  She nodded, and let me guide her into a walk. Not quite a full block later, we arrived at the front door of Badd's Bar and Grill. At one in the morning it was still crowded with people spilling out the door, which was propped open by a chair, on which sat Bast, my oldest brother. His burly, tattooed forearms crossed over his chest as he closely scrutinized the IDs of a quartet of college-age girls waiting to be admitted. He jerked his head toward the interior of the bar, indicating the girls could go in, and then his eyes cut to mine, and Evangeline.  
  
  ""Jesus, Bax. The fuck did you do now?"" He left the chair and took a step toward us. ""Honey, is this ugly gorilla bothering you? Say the word and I'll break his legs for you.""  
  
  Evangeline shrank away from Bast, which was understandable. He's taller than any of us at six-four, and he's built like a brick shithouse. He's covered in tattoos, and he's a surly, intimidating bastard. I may be big and beefy and scary looking, but I make up for it by having a winning personality, a show-stopping, panty-melting grin, and enough charm to knock an entire sorority house on their collective, PINK sweatpants-clad asses. Bast is just scary, because he comes across pretty much like the surly, intimidating bastard that he is--unless you're his wife Dru, around whom he melts into this tail-wagging, golden retriever puppy dog-eyed soppy mush basket.  
  
  ""I didn't do anything, you oversized cock waffle,"" I snap. ""I helped, as a matter of fact.""  
  
  ""You're telling me you're not responsible for the blood all over her?"" Bast asked, an eyebrow wryly arched.  
  
  I rolled my eyes and sighed. ""That's irrelevant."" I shoved him away. ""Your wifey awake?""  
  
  He nodded ""Probably. Why?""  
  
  I shrug. ""Evangeline needs to clean up and change.""  
  
  Bast waved. ""Yeah, she's up there. You're gonna catch hell for this, though. You know that, right?""  
  
  ""For what? I'm helping a damsel in distress.""  
  
  Bast snorted. ""Okay, Sir Galahad."" He addressed Evangeline. ""If he gets out of hand, let me know. Okay? I'm serious.""  
  
  Evangeline just stared at Bast with an unreadable, blank expression on her face, and then she looked at me. ""You promised me a drink, a shower, and some clean clothes, not amusing banter.""  
  
  ""She means a shower alone, Bax,"" Bast said, smirking. ""Keep that in mind, yeah?""  
  
  ""No shit, you ugly oaf. I am capable of chivalry, you know."" I made sure that comment was the last word between us and then led Evangeline through the crowded bar, keeping a tight grip on her hand as we wove between clumps and clusters of sweaty, boozing, dancing customers.  
  
  The twins were on stage tonight, doing an acoustic set, with Canaan playing an acoustic guitar and Corin sitting on one of those box-drum things, which he slapped with his hands to create a rolling percus  
sive rhythm. They were both singing, doing that eerily perfect harmony only those two can manage.  
  
  Evangeline tugged at my hand to slow me down just as we were reaching the locked doorway behind which was the stairs to the apartment over the bar.  
  
  ""I recognize those guys,"" she said into my ear. ""Either it's an amazing cover act, or that's actually Bishop's Pawn.""  
  
  I laughed. ""That's actually Bishop's Pawn,"" I answered.  
  
  She eyed me in amazement. ""No way! I saw them in Germany last year. They're amazing! What are they doing playing in this dingy dive bar?""  
  
  Apparently she hadn't put two and two together yet. ""Well, sweetheart, that's a kind of complicated question to answer.""  
  
  I dug into my hoodie pocket and produced my keys, unlocked the door, which was marked ""private access only"" as a joke. Usually doors like that say something like ""No access,"" or just ""Private"" or ""employee access only"", but Cane and Cor apparently thought it would be funny to put ""private access only"" on the door, and so there it is. I led her up the stairs and into the apartment, letting go of her hand reluctantly as we entered. I say reluctantly, because I'd been holding her hand for ten or fifteen minutes at that point and her hand in mine felt really nice. Like, just holding her hand felt tingly and exciting. Made me feel like a twelve-year-old kid again, sitting at the high school football game with my crush, having just gotten up the courage to grab her hand. Now, as then, I didn't want to let go.  
  
  Which was stupid.  
  
  For a lot of reasons, none of which I was quite ready to examine.  
  
  Dru was on the couch watching TV, a fleece throw blanket on her legs, a giant glass of red wine in one hand, a bowl of popcorn on her lap. Copper hair currently in a sloppy, frizzy braid, bright cornflower-blue eyes, creamy skin, and a fierce Irish temper, Dru was the closest in build to Evangeline of any of my brothers' women. They were similar in height, and they both had mouthwatering hourglass figures. Yeah, I don't mind admitting Bast's wife is hot as fuck, but she's my brother's wife and my sister-in-law, and all I'll ever do is appreciate what God made. Point is, their similar builds means Dru probably had clothes that will fit Evangeline. Which is why I'm bringing her here as opposed to the apartment over the twins' music studio a few doors down, where I actually live.  
  
  She shot a cursory glance at me as I entered; Evangeline was still hidden behind me. ""Hey, Bax. Win your fight?""  
  
  ""Obviously. McDermott is a puny little bitch. He didn't stand a snowball's chance in hell.""  
  
  ""What are you doing up here?"" Dru asked, her eyes on the TV. ""I'm not cooking for you.""  
  
  ""Can I borrow a change of clothes from you?"" I asked, setting down my gear bag.  
  
  She turned her head toward me, exaggeratedly slowly. ""Even if you did take up cross-dressing, I don't think my clothes are going to--HOLY SHIT."" She shot to her feet when Evangeline appeared from behind me, tossing her blanket aside and setting the popcorn and wine on the coffee table as she hurried over to us. ""What the hell did you do to this poor girl, Bax?""  
  
  I slapped my forehead with a snarl of irritation. ""Why does everyone always assume the worst about me? Jesus."" I gestured at Evangeline. ""Dru, this is Evangeline. Evangeline, this is my sister-in-law, Dru. Now. Dru--would it be possible for Evangeline to clean up and get a change of clean clothes from you?""  
  
  ""Of course! Come on."" Dru took Evangeline by the arm and dragged her through the living room and into the hall bathroom, where she sat the shell-shocked and confused Evangeline down onto the closed toilet lid. ""Sit. Relax. Let me get this blood off you. Are you hurt? What did Bax do?""  
  
  I remained in the kitchen, where I fixed Evangeline a vodka cranberry. ""I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HER!"" I hollered.  
  
  ""Then whose blood is this?"" Dru shouted back. ""And shut up. Claire is sleeping.""  
  
  A door opened. ""Not anymore, assholes."" Claire shuffled out of her and Brock's room, blinking sleepily, wearing a T-shirt of Brock's and probably nothing else. ""Who's this?--who are you? And why are we shouting at Bax?""  
  
  ""We're not shouting at Bax,"" I said, bringing the drink to the bathroom.  
  
  I squeezed past Claire and into the bathroom, then slid behind Dru and sat on the lip of the tub, handing Evangeline the drink. ""You seemed like a vodka cranberry type.""  
  
  She took it and sipped at it. ""Whoa. Heavy on the vodka, much?""  
  
  I shrugged. ""That was a shitty situation. Figured if I promised you a stiff drink I'd better make it hella stiff.""  
  
  ""Does anyone actually even say 'hella' anymore?"" Claire asked, from the hall outside the bathroom. ""And will someone please explain to me what's going on?""  
  
  Dru--who had a package of makeup wipes in her hand was gingerly wiping at the blood on Evangeline's face--shot me a meaningful glare. ""Bax? Care to explain?""  
  
  I sighed. ""Well, Evangeline here wandered by mistake into the warehouse where my fight was happening. I noticed her but she seemed out of place, and then she left. On the way home I happened to walk past an alley near the warehouse. I saw these four fucking asswipes with their hands all over Evangeline, so I stopped them, and I brought her here to get her cleaned up.""  
  
  Evangeline snorted, a somehow ladylike sound of derisive disbelief. She stood up, taking a wipe from the package in Dru's hand, and faced the mirror, wiping at her face vigorously. ""You're leaving out a few things, I believe."" She plucked at a strand of her hair, peeling away a clump of dried blood with her fingernails, grimacing in disgust. ""Such as, for example, the way you punched that guy in the ring so hard his blood sprayed all over me--and I'm fairly certain you did it on purpose.""  
  
  ""You distracted me. What can I say?"" I shrugged and crossed my arms over my chest. ""But you're right, I did do that on purpose. It was kind of a dick move, and I apologize.""  
  
  She eyed me sidelong, glaring. ""I...distracted you? You demolished that poor man in a matter of seconds.""  
  
  ""Exactly!"" I said. ""I was planning on drawing it out a little bit, giving the audience a bit more of a show. Then you strutted in looking as lost as a poodle at a pit bull fight, and I forgot.""  
  
  Evangeline stopped what she was doing entirely. ""There are so many things wrong with that statement I don't even know where to start."" She took a drink from her vodka cranberry and then ticked off items on her fingers as she listed them. ""First, what do you mean by more of a show? Letting him rough you up a little before beating him half to death? Toying with him like a cat with a mouse? Secondly, a poodle? Of all the dogs you could compare me to, you choose a poodle? A yipping, obnoxious, useless little lapdog? Is that what you think I am, too? And third, pit bull fighting is vile and despicable. Those poor animals have no choice in those brutal fights. You have a choice. You choose to fight for money. All they get is hurt and abused.""  
  
  I held up both hands. ""Whoa there, Eva, slow your roll, honey."" I stood up and moved a little closer, ignoring the way both Claire and Dru were following this conversation with unabashed interest. ""First, yeah, I meant toy with him like a cat with a mouse-- let him hit me a few times, make him and the audience think he's got half a chance against me. And also, I didn't beat him half to death. Even those fuckin' dickless cunt-holes who tried to rape you got off easy. I hurt 'em pretty bad, yeah, but not anywhere near as bad as they deserved, and not half to death. If you've never seen someone literally beaten so badly they're in danger of dying, then you can't possibly understand the difference.""  
  
  I leveled her a look with all the hardened, world-weary bitterness I had inside me, just so she knew I wasn't kidding. ""Second, I wasn't comparing you to a poodle. It was...a situational comparison. You, wandering into an illegal underground MMA fight is relatable to an innocent little mini poodle trotting unaware into the ring with a pair of pit bulls. If I was going to compare you to an animal, it sure as fuck wouldn't be an ugly-ass, stupid little goddamn poodle--more like a swan or something elegant like that. Third, you're right, pit bull fighting is bullshit and I hate it. I once beat the shit out of a guy for kicking his dog, so we're in agreement there. I choose to fight, because I'm good at it and I enjoy it.""  
\>  
  She poked me in the chest with a manicured finger. ""I've told you several times already, my name is Evangeline, not Eva. Get it right, you muscle-bound meathead."" She went back to wiping at her face, scraping a dot of blood off her perfect little chin. ""Now. If it's still all right with whomever lives here, I would be very grateful if I could take a quick shower.""  
  
  Dru grabbed my wrist, digging her thumbnail into a pressure point, and hauled me out of the bathroom. ""Out, Bax. Out. Let the girl get cleaned up."" To Evangeline, then. ""You're welcome here for as long as you need. Give me ten seconds and I'll have a change of clothes for you. Take as long a shower as you want.""  
  
  Dru vanished and then reappeared with a pair of sweatpants and a T-shirt, and a pair of pink Gap flip flops, setting everything on the counter, and then I was shoved out of the bathroom and down the hallway into the living room, Claire following behind us.  
  
  Dru did some kind of twist and pivot move on me, and my right arm and wrist were bent wrong, so one false move on my part would have me eating left handed for a few months--just goes to show that even the biggest and baddest aren't invincible. I mean, I could power through the pain, chop out a kick, and have Dru on her ass in half a second...probably. But number one, she's my sister-in-law and I love her, because she's good for Bast and she's just a cool-ass chick, and number two, I'm not entirely certain I could take her. She's a bad bitch, and I mean that with every ounce of respect I've got.  
  
  ""What the fuck, Dru?"" I held still and didn't fight against the hold.  
  
  ""You tell me what the fuck, Bax. She's wearing earrings that have to be at least fifteen thousand dollars, and I'm pretty sure that's a Hermes blouse, thousand dollar Manolo flats, and a Prada purse.""  
  
  ""I don't know what any of that means."" I tested her hold, and she let go. ""And so what if she's got money? What does that have anything to do with fuckin' anything, Dru?""  
  
  ""Not to be mean, Bax, but women like her don't really tend to go for guys like you."" She moved to take the opposite end of the couch from me, where she'd been curled up when we arrived.   I snort. ""Well no shit, sis. Think I don't know that?"" I shrugged out of my hoodie, leaving me bare-chested with my bloodstained tape on my hands and wrists; I sat on the couch and started peeling the tape off. ""This ain't that, Dru. I told the truth, okay? She wandered into the fight by accident, I still don't know how or why. She got right up against the barrier, and sort of got a little blood on her. And yeah, I hit the guy on purpose so she'd get sprayed.  
  
  ""She was staring at me, looking all disgusted and fascinated at the same time, and it pissed me off and made me all...I dunno...crazy, I guess. I've never been looked at like that before. Like I was...like I was a lion in a cage at the zoo, and she was fascinated by me but wasn't sure she wanted to get too close. So I hit McDermott and she got splattered. Dick move, my bad, what-the-fuck-ever. Thought that was that.""  
  
  I tossed the tape from my right hand in a pile on the coffee table, and started on my left hand. ""Then I take my cash and head out, pass an alley, and I hear noises. Guys talking shit, a girl's voice sounding upset. Peeked into the alley, and saw four guys holding down one girl, and having trouble with her. One guy had a knife and was talkin' mean. They were gonna rape her, all four of 'em, and that shit does not fly with me. So I kicked the motherfuckin' shit out of all four of 'em. And, let me add, I would have done the same for any woman, rich as hell or not.""  
  
  The door opened, then, and Zane swaggered in. He was meticulously clean, except for a spray of blood down one cheek. ""Bax, bro, we gotta talk.""  
  
  ""I am talkin', Zane. Filling the girls in on what happened.""  
  
  ""Well, there's more filling in to do, if you know what I mean."" He sat down on the love seat kitty corner to the couch where I was perched.  
  
  Dru and Claire both stared at Zane suspiciously, and then I saw concern flicker across Dru's face.  
  
  ""No. No--tell me you didn't, Zane,"" Dru murmured.  
  
  He kept his face admirably blank. ""Didn't what, Dru?""  
  
  She eyed me, then him. ""The fight Bax got in tonight, in the alley. Were you there?""  
  
  Zane's gaze didn't waver. ""At the end, yeah. I wasn't in on the fun part, though.""  
  
  ""The fun part?"" Dru flicked an eyebrow up. ""Would that be the part where four guys almost raped a woman? Or the part where Bax put the hurt on them?""  
  
  He held up his hands palms out. ""It's just an expression, Jesus.""  
  
  The door opened again, and a massively pregnant Mara stormed in. ""Zane, you fucking asshole! It's two thirty in the fucking morning and I expected you home forty-five minutes ago! I've texted you sixteen times, called you four, and you're sitting here with your brother like it's no big deal?""  
  
  I surged off the couch and moved to intercept. ""Mara, babe, cool off. It's not his fault. He was helping me.""  
  
  ""Don't tell me to cool off, Baxter, you fucking cave troll!"" She halted, her gaze going from me to Zane, to the pile of bloody tape, to the girls, and then to the unfamiliar Prada purse sitting on the half wall separating the kitchen from the living room, and then to the sound of the shower in the bathroom. ""Wait. Helping you with what? Whose pimp-ass Prada purse is that? Who's in the shower? Because if Brock comes out buck naked again with that dick of his swinging around and I gotta see it again, I'm gonna be pissed.""  
  
  Claire snickered. ""We should all be so lucky. But no, he's downstairs behind the bar. You'd have seen him had you not been storming through on the warpath.""  
  
  ""When Zane ignores me, I get pissed. I'm about to have a baby any day, and he needs to answer me if I'm trying to get a hold of him.""  
  
  Zane was off the couch and grabbing Mara, holding her tight against him. ""I'm sorry, babe. I wasn't ignoring you. I just...couldn't answer right then.""  
  
  ""And why is that, Zane, pray tell?"" Dru asked, her voice heavily inflected with sarcasm.  
  
  I eyed my brother. ""This may not be the best moment for this discussion.""  
  
  Zane shook his head incrementally. ""It's...not like that. Not like you're thinking.""  
  
  We certainly didn't need the trouble, so just for that reason I hoped I was reading him right. ""It's not?""  
  
  ""Nope.""  
  
  ""You two macho fucksticks need to quit talking in riddles and start coming out with explanations,"" Dru snapped. ""Now.""  
  
  Zane sighed, and sat back down, pulling Mara onto his lap. ""Okay, here's the truth. Those four assholes who tried to rape that girl in the fancy clothes--what was her name? Eve? Eva? Something like that. Well...I felt like they needed to be taught more of a lesson than Bax put on them. I didn't personally do anything to them, though. All I did was make a phone call to a buddy who happens to be in the area on...ah...vacation, let's say. This buddy of mine specializes in teaching what you might call unforgettable lessons, and in such a way as to make sure none of it ever comes back to any of us."" He waved a hand. ""And that's all any of you need to know, or ever will know."" He said this last part with a finality none of us dared to challenge, even Mara.  
  
  ""That girl in the fancy clothes is named Evangeline,"" I put in. ""And she's here, in the shower.""  
  
  A fact I've been trying like hell not to think about. Unsuccessfully. I mean, that body? Goddamn. I'd sell a kidney for a single glimpse at that body of hers naked and dripping wet. Her long black hair, soaked and sticking to her tan skin? Those tits and that ass, with water sliding over her lush curves? Those eyes, wide and green and staring up at me as I--  
  
  Fuck. No, no, no, nope. Can't go there.  
  
  Down boy, Baxter.  
  
  I don't think Zane missed the way my eyes glazed over, just then.  
  
  ""Is she, now?"" he drawled, smirking. ""Interesting.""  
  
  ""Shut the fuck up, Zane,"" I snarled.  
  
  ""Testy much, Bax?"" He chuckled. ""Sorry to say, kid, but I think she's out of your league.""  
  
  ""There's no league. It's not like that,"" I insisted. ""She needed help, and I helped her. That's it. Quit riding my dick about it.""  
  
  The bathroom door opened, and Evangeline wandered out. Her hair was damp, and blacker than ever, reflecting the light. She had a brush in one hand, and was running it through her hair. I clenched my jaw and curled my hands into fists, because I was about to moan out loud from raw, unbridled lust.  
  
  The sweatpants were faded gray, tight around her hips and butt, loose through the legs, and tight around her calves, tugged up to just beneath her knees. The T-shirt was a green, white, and blue Seahawks raglan shirt, and it was cut to fit snug, but it was too small for her, and she wasn't wearing a bra and this apartment was a little chilly at the moment, and she had tits for fuckin' days, and I couldn't breathe because all the blood was flowing to my cock.  
  
  Because...  
  
  Jesus tits.  
  
  Girl had Jesus Tits. Capital letters. Wait, that's not good enough. All caps: JESUS TITS.  
  
  I mean...damn. The Hermes shirt and whatever bullshit bra she'd been wearing before did NOT do her rack justice. I could see them perfectly behind the cotton, their beautiful teardrop shape, heavy and natural and jiggling tantalizingly with each step she took, and her nipples were so hard and sharp they could just about poke straight through the thin cotton. It was an old shirt, well worn, and the cotton was so thin I could almost see the color of her skin, and the pink of her nips...  
  
  I was staring like a hormonal teenager at a titty club for the first time. I wrenched my eyes away, but not before meeting hers, and I realized she'd caught me staring. She shifted uncomfortably, pivoting away, her shoulders curling in, as if she was self-conscious, and then she straightened in defiance, her chin lifting, and she turned back to face the room, and me. It took a supreme effort of will to keep my eyes firmly fixed on her eyes as I addressed her.  
  
  ""Hey, Evangeline. Feeling any better?"" I asked.  
  
  She nodded, leaning against the wall in the entry of the hallway. ""A shower does work wonders."" She eyed the crowd in the living room, which had grown substantially since she got in the shower, now that Mara and Zane had joined Claire, Dru, and me. ""What's...what's going on?""  
  
  ""This is an intervention,"" I joked. ""We're all here because we're concerned about you, Evangeli  
ne. This is a circle of trust, okay? You can talk to us without judgment.""  
  
  She smirked. ""I wish I could laugh, but I've been on the receiving end of an intervention that started almost verbatim like that.""  
  
  I guffawed. ""You? Hell, nah. What could you have been into that you needed an intervention?""  
  
  She shrugged, keeping a straight face. ""You'd be surprised. What if I'm not as straight-laced and fancy as you assume?""  
  
  ""Ohhhhh-kay, sure. Whatever you say, honey."" I heaped sarcasm into the words.  
  
  She couldn't keep the straight face. ""Okay, fine. It was to do with my friends in high school. I was hanging out with some kids from a different group, and my friends held an intervention to remind me of the importance and responsibility of my social standing. It wasn't seemly for me to be associating with...the unsavory sort.""  
  
  ""Bet you wish they could get a load of me, then, huh? We could really shock 'em.""  
  
  She laughed. ""Oh my, they would faint dead away, I think. I doubt they've changed much since high school. They still flit around the same town they all grew up in, driving their husband's cars instead of Daddy's, spending money and judging people.""  
  
  ""Sounds like a wonderful bunch of bitches.""  
  
  ""God, they're awful. They all nearly fainted the first time I told them I'd refused Thomas's proposal--"" she cut herself off, blushing. ""But that's not important."" She glanced around the room. ""I'm Evangeline du Maurier.""  
  
  Claire, perched on the arm of the couch near me, slapped my arm. ""You're a mannerless barbarian, Baxter. Seriously. Introductions, maybe?""  
  
  I whacked her shoulder back, but gently and playfully, because Claire was all of five feet five inches and weighed maybe one-ten, one-twenty fully clothed and soaking wet and holding a ten-pound bowling ball, and if I smacked her too hard she might go flying through the wall and into the bay, the tiny, svelte, slender little thing that she was. Delicate looking, but fierce and ferocious in personality.  
  
  ""Yep, mannerless barbarian. That's me."" I gestured at Evangeline. ""Well, like she said, her name is Evangeline du Maurier. Eva, you've met Dru, and I know I introduced you properly. The little blonde pixie here by my arm is Claire. Zane is the ugly fucker you've already met, back in the alley, my brother. The angry pregnant lady is Mara.  
  
  ""For reference, Dru is married to Sebastian, the surly cock waffle with all the tats who was guarding the door when we came in. He's the oldest Badd brother. Zane and Mara are together, and thank god because he knocked her fine ass up real good. Claire is with Brock, who you may or may not have noticed slinging drinks behind the bar, he was the pretty, GQ-looking motherfucker. He's the next brother older than me, after Zane, who's in between Brock and Bast--which is short for Sebastian.""  
  
  Evangeline looked like her head was spinning. ""Wait. There are four of you? And you all look like...that?""  
  
  Dru laughed, a genuine belly laugh. ""Oh god, Evangeline, honey: there's eight of them, and yes, they all look like that.""  
  
  Evangeline boggled, her mouth opening and closing, no sound coming out. ""No way. Nuh-uh. Not possible.""  
  
  Dru tugged a slim silver cell phone out of her bra, opened it, tapped a few times, and then handed Evangeline the phone.  
  
  Evangeline eyed me, then the phone, and then moved to sit beside me, squishing in between Dru and me. ""Who's who?"" she asked, addressing me.  
  
  The photo was of the eight of us brothers standing in a line abreast by age with Bast on the far left and Xavier on the far right, our arms around each other from end to end. We'd closed the bar down on a Monday a month or so ago, rented a boat and took a trip to some island or another that Brock and Claire knew about, and we horsed around on the beach and swam in the ball-shrivelingly cold water and made a bonfire. And at some point, the girls had insisted we get a picture of all of us brothers together.  
  
  I ignored the way my whole right side was tingling from where her body was brushed up against mine, and tried to keep my eyes on the phone and off her tits; I started on the left and pointed at each of us in turn. ""In order from oldest to youngest you've got Bast, Zane, Brock, me, Canaan, Corin, Lucian, and Xavier.""  
  
  Evangeline just stared for a moment. And then I saw the penny drop. ""Wait. Canaan and Corin--Bishop's Pawn...they're your brothers?""  
  
  I nodded, grinning. ""Yep. Talented boys, ain't they?""  
  
  She glanced around the apartment, and then at the door to the downstairs. ""So the, um, dingy dive bar they're playing in?""  
  
  ""Badd's Bar and Grill. Family owned and operated since nineteen eighty...um...four? Five? Hell if I know."" I winked at her expression. ""We're the Badd brothers, spelled B-A-doubleD.""  
  
  ""Oh."" Evangeline just shook her head and handed the phone back to Dru. ""Well that's just ridiculous. Nobody needs that much male perfection in one family.""  
  
  Claire giggled. ""Honey, you ain't seen male perfection until you've seen a Badd boy's big ol'--"" SMACK.  
  
  That would be the sound of an issue of ELLE magazine flying through the air, courtesy of Mara, and hitting Claire straight in the face.  
  
  ""CLAIRE. SHUT--THE FUCK--UP,"" Mara said, managing to snap the phrase through grinding teeth. ""We just met poor Evangeline. Let's not shock her all at once, shall we?""  
  
  Evangeline was blushing so hard it was a wonder she had any blood left in her body, her cheeks were so red. ""I, um. Wow. Okay.""  
  
  ""Awww, she's blushing."" Claire grinned, a predatory gleam of her teeth. ""I like her. I can have fun with this.""  
  
  Mara sighed. ""No, Claire. Just...no. Don't go there. Do not scare the new girl.""  
  
  Evangeline eyed them both, and then looked to me for an answer. ""What are they talking about?""  
  
  I winked at her. ""Penises.""  
  
  Claire threw the magazine at me, catching me on the jaw with the spine. ""Baxter! Don't shock the new girl! She blushes easily.""  
  
  And, indeed, Evangeline was blushing even harder, if that was possible. ""This conversation has devolved rather swiftly, I must say.""  
  
  I just laughed. ""Babe, this conversation hasn't even gotten started.""  
  
  Her perfectly arched eyebrows lifted. ""That sounds...worrisome.""  
  
  I laughed even harder, because it didn't seem as if she was trying to be funny, but rather she really was just that...conservative, shall we say. ""You have no idea. We're not very politically correct around here. We're wildly inappropriate as a rule, we drop F-bombs with horrifying frequency, we drink a shitload of booze on the regular, and we make fun of each other as a lifestyle. If you're easily embarrassed or shocked...well, babe...you're in for a hell of wild ride if you're gonna hang with us.""  
  
  ""I just...I wasn't trying to impose or..."" she trailed off. ""Become the new girl, or anything. It all just happened so fast. I don't even remember where the B and B I'm staying at is located. It's been a heck of a long day, and I'm still a little shaken up by what happened, and...""  
  
  Dru poured a healthy measure of red wine into the glass she'd been drinking from when we arrived. ""The Badd brothers have a way of sucking us poor, innocent, unsuspecting good girls into their dark and dirty orbit. Just how they are. You're here, you've had our booze, you're wearing my clothes--you're in the gang now, babe. Better buckle up."" She handed the glass to Evangeline and gently nudged her back down onto the couch. ""Don't worry, between Mara, Claire, and me, we'll take care of you.""  
  
  Evangeline took a big sip from the wine. ""This is overwhelming.""  
  
  ""Isn't it? And this isn't even everyone. Bast, Brock, the twins, Luce, and Xavier are all still downstairs working the bar."" Claire reached across me and stole the glass of wine from Evangeline, took a sip, and handed it back. ""So. Evangeline. What brings you to Ketchikan?""  
  
  She tipped her head to one side. ""Well...honestly, I needed to get away from...ah...everything, I guess. Ketchikan was recommended to me by one of my father's drivers as a remote but nice getaway, and it's certainly far away from anywhere my father or Thomas might look, so..."" She shrugged. ""Here I am. As far away from Father and Thomas as I can get, on short notice.""  
  
  ""So you're running away?"" Claire asked.  
<  
br />   Evangeline blinked, hesitating. ""Sort of?""  
  
  ""Fair enough,"" Claire said. ""Can we go back to you turning down some kind of proposal from this guy Thomas? That sounded like a fun story.""  
  
  Evangeline let out a breath. ""It's really not.""  
  
  ""That sigh says differently,"" Claire says. ""I'll trade you stories, if you want. How Brock and I met, for the dish on you and Thomas.""  
  
  Another of those sighs, during which Evangeline stared into the ruby liquid in the glass. ""Fine. But you go first. I need more wine if I'm going to talk about Thomas.""  
  
  Dru tipped the rest of the bottle into the glass, and then glanced at Claire. ""There's another bottle over the fridge. And some whiskey for the boys. Since we're having an impromptu party in my living room, we might as well make it a proper party.""  
  
  In short order, glasses of wine and whiskey were passed around, except for Mara, who sipped on sparkling water.  
  
  Evangeline kicked her feet up on the coffee table, crossed her arms over her breasts, keeping her wine clutched in one hand as if holding on to it for dear life. Her thigh and hip were touching mine, and she was slowly leaning into me, letting her shoulder rest against mine. I held still and let her decide on contact, because I didn't want to read into anything, and I sure as fuck wasn't going to try anything so soon after what she'd been through. I did like the way it felt to have her this close, though. She smelled amazing, like vanilla and flowers and shampoo; she smelled fuckin' delicious, is how she smelled, and I wanted to take a little taste of her. Start at the luscious, tanned column of her throat and devour my way downward, inch by inch, until I was between her thighs, and had her screaming my name.  
  
  And...fuck--I just gave myself a hard-on. Wonderful. She was sitting right next to me, with my sister-in-law on the other side, and I had a hard-on trying to unfurl behind my fighting trunks, which didn't do much to hide anything, especially since I'd taken off my cup and jockstrap and was rocking my junk commando.  
  
  I tried to casually rest my hands with my glass of whiskey over myself to hide things, but judging by the way Evangeline was blushing and studiously staring into her wine and not looking at me, I think it's safe to say she noticed.  
  
  Claire was talking, and I was mostly listening. I shot a sideways glance at Evangeline, and noticed her gaze sliding, inching, and creeping from her wineglass over to me. I moved my hands away, just a little bit, letting the outline of my cock show, just a hint. And yep, her gaze went right to it. Her knuckles whitened as she gripped her wineglass with one hand and her own forearm with the other.

However, it made my stomach hurt. No other flavors across the lines (I’ve tried almost every line except the coffees and a couple of the electrolyte ones). But man. It made me feel so sick. Why only this flavor?? ",1,1756602305.0,Cirkul,0,1.0,False
1n4ho8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchizoFamilies/comments/1n4ho8z/intellectually_disabled_schizophrenic_mother_rant/,Intellectually Disabled Schizophrenic Mother (Rant),"I dont really know how to begin this. I guess I will start with some background. As a child my mother was diagnosed with an intellectual disability. I know this as it was told to me by my mother herself and my grandma (her mom). At the age of 15 (or so im told) my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Since I was a child, I remember seeing and hearing my mom act out and reply to what I now know were symptoms of her psychosis. Specifically auditory and visual hallucinations. As well as religious psychosis and persecutory delusions. Sometimes they would occur concurrently. I remember being maybe 5 or 6 and watching her yell at the ceiling, accusing the neighbors of doing drugs, yelling that the neighbor was cheating on her husband. I remember her looking at me, promising she was keeping me safe by casting spells to ward away evil spirits and people that wanted to hurt us. She told me she was a witch. Multiple times throughout my childhood I spent nights crying alone and a random family members house because my mom would constantly be sent in and out of psychiatric facilities. I didn’t know that at the time though. Nobody was ever honest with me. They only told me that she was sick. That she needed to get better, and that I would be back with her soon. I am 21 now. The more I think about it. thee more I realize that as a kid, I never thought there was anything wrong with her. I think I thought she  really was protecting me. My dad wasn't around the entirety of my life. It was just me and her. I knew even as a child that we didn’t have much. I knew the area we lived in was bad. I knew I had to be careful around strangers. My mom was my biggest protector. Even in her state, she managed to care for her child alone. With all this in my mind, as a child, I truly believed she could keep me safe. She told me god was in the clouds, that the angels were watching us in our house and if i could see them standing there, that she was granted powers to heal, that god bestowed upon her powers I couldn’t even dream of. I think I liked to imagine with her, but part of me felt something was not right.  Sometime after 2007 ( I was 3 at this point sorry for kind of going backwards), my grandma (moms mom) was released from jail. My mom and I used to visit her all the time. I still have pictures of my in my ponytail with my grandma hugging me from behind. Long story short- my grandma didn’t really care for me when she got out. My aunt (moms sister) just had my cousin., and she was mainly around them after she was released. So once again, just me and my mom. My third earliest memory was of me in school, maybe 1st or 2nd grade. My teacher asked me what had happend to my head. I think it was the night before, but it couldn’t been 2 nights before, my mom had been yelling at me. I didn’t know what she was yelling about, but she was angry at something. I remember I couldn’t even look at her face because of how scared I was. She grabbed me by my hair and threw me full force against a metal closest. When I got up she told me how sorry she was. She took me to the bathroom and made me look at myself in the mirror. I remember seeing my skI’ll through the laceration on my forehead. She told me I couldn’t tell anybody or they would take me away from her. That I would never see her again. My next memory is of me having something draped along my face, crying, whild the doctor or nurse or whoever it was put stitches in my head. I like to think she did this because of her diagnoses. That IT made her do it. I still hope it did. She had intense paranoia during my teen years. She never let me go out with my friends out of fear I would get injured, graped, or worse. Grape was always a center of her delusions as well. That someone was coming to do that to me or her in the middle of the night. That if she didn’t stay up for the whole night something was bound to happen. Her lack of sleep didn’t help the situation. Any friend (which wasn’t many) boy or girl, she would accuse the of graping her while she was “unconscious”. I remember being so embarrassed. Just thinking to myself, ”why would she say that to my friends?”. I only had maybe 4 people ever in our apartment from 6th to 11th grade. I was honestly pretty isolated, and I’m ashamed to say it was out of embarassment. My grandma at some point decided to take it upon herself to start being around my mom and I more. I believe it was only because my mom and I moved into a duplex, with my aunt, uncle, and 2 cousins living above us. I think she finally got to see how bad my moms condition really was. My cousins were my lifeline. My best friends. One day my mom didn’t something I didn’t find particularly safe to my younger cousin, she was about 3. It was nothing crazy, but enough to bother me enough to tell my aunt bc I didn’t like how she treated my cousin. At that point, my aunt confronted my mom, and stopped letting my cousins come downstairs to play with me. I think after that point my grandma saw how bad it really was for her. How she would yell at the mold in the walls, how she wasn’t able to leave the house, wouldn’t even leave her room. Wouldn’t brush her teeth or take a shower. She would sit in the same clothes for days no matter how much I would try to tell her to get up. That I want her to get up. That she can’t stay there all day. I begged her. She was in and out of hospitals as I said early. This time though, I knew what was going on. She’s been on meds to treat schizophrenia since her diagnoses, by the way. Nothing ever seems to work, even now. My aunt and uncle moved out of that duplex maybe in 2017? My mom and I took the top portion of the duplex after they left, and new neighbors moved downstairs. At this point, my mom would accuse me daily of not being who I said I was. That she didn’t recognize me and that I should leave. Questioning me every night if I was who I said i was, her daughter. She even quizzed me sometimes. There have been moments she was so sure I wasn’t me, she’s held knives up to me. Threatened, and did, kick me out, then immediately tell my family I ran away. At this age, maybe 15 or 16, I was doing things I wasn’t supposed to, as I thought I found a partner. Someone who understood me deeply. Young love as they say. When I was kicked out, I ran to stay with him. Back to my mom. We often got into physical altercations, mainly with her trying to hold me down when she tried blocking my door way, not allowing me to leave until the “real me” came back. I hated that. I would often fall asleep on the floor in that house, just because I found it comfy. She would walk into my room at night and step on my back claiming she was keeping me alive. In the middle of most nights after 10th grade, she would swing my door open, and try to “speak a different language” to ”rid me of my demons”. She often tried to perform exorcisms on me. I would tell me constantly there were things we couldn’t do as we were being filmed in our home, and that we wouldn’t be able to disable the cameras “they“ had put up. One night, when I ran to my ex’s house to get away from my mom. We often used recreational drugs together. This particular time I went over, it was after me begging for him to get me. I was in shambles. We were technically broken up during that time. When we got to his house, we started using said recreational drugs. Then he started trying to trip me out. Telling me we had crashed, and that where I was, who I am, and even the conversation we were having wasn’t real. it didn’t work entirely, but it was enough to freak me out. The cops came to his house and I was forced to go home. His mom ending up being the one to drop me off. She was talking to me the whole ride, but I have no recollection of what she told me, That was the last time I ever spoke to him. I think in the moments that I was just about to believe the thing he was saying to me were true, I thought of my mom. I thought of how real everything must feel to her. How she can’t help it. Although it hurt, he helped me realize a lot that night. Even with that lightbulb moment. I dont think I’ve ever fully accepted my mom. That may be the wrong way to word it. I think I’ve actually grown to resent her, and I hate myself for that. At 17 we got evicted from the duplex because the neighbors accused my mom of harassing them. That she would say wildly inappropriate things (which she did) and it made them feel unsafe. They were not aware of her diagnosis. I moved to live with my aunt, and my mom now lives in a recreational facility. After all this time, I find it so unfair. My grandma was the one telling me I couldn’t leave the house because my mom needed company, that I had to be sure she took her pills correctly, that I had to do my best to take care of her because I was “all she had” . I was alone when she experienced her outbursts. I was alone during her active psychosis when my friends were out having fun.  My grandma may have poked her head in a few times, but she was never THERE. She doesn’t really know how my mom acted. I hate that I felt ashamed of my mom, but I also hate that her fears controlled my life. That I couldn’t play sports, join clubs, or attended after school events with my friends. You know, for a while I hated her for not being able to change. I think at that age, my thoughts were, “if she loved me, she would put in the work, she would make herself healthy for me. If she can do that, I know that she really loves me, I know that all im giving up has a purpose. I know my lonliness will pave the way for something meaningful.”. My whole life, I’ve never had a heart to heart with my mom. I spent 17 years living with a woman I didn’t really know if im being honest. We never had those mother-daughter moments I hear people talking out. She never gave me the talk, never told me about boys, she never taught me how to cook because she didn’t know how, we never went on walks to get coffee, we never bonded over shopping. I dont ever remembering coming to her for advice about anything because I was afraid telling her there was any conflict in my life would throw her off the edge, that it would scare her. I think what hurt the worst, was when I felt ready to talk to her about what was going on in her head. I remember looking at her begging to please tell me how I could help her. I remember asking what the hospital (psych facilities) would do that would help her feel better (because for a short time after her return from them, she would be happy. she would wear her smile proudly). She would stare at me. After anything I would say. She wouldn’t even look at me. It was like she didn’t see me, didn’t hear me. Like all her senses were stolen from her. I begged her for so long to give me something, the smallest thought, some insight to anything going on in her head. It was the only thing I ever cried to her about. It was like this for so long I just stopped asking. Instead my resentment grew. Now, at the age of 21, I still dont know what to do. It is heartbreaking to hear her call me over the phone, and continue on with her delusions, which I know feel so real to her. I try over and over with each call to tell her about her diagnosis. That I hear and believe her when she says she feels, hears, sees, and fears all that is around her. With her disability, I know it is hard for her to understand. It is hard to explain something to someone who doesn’t know what she doesn’t know. Whose perception of reality is altered. I hate letting my feelings get in the way. I haven’t visited her in months. After every visit, I find myself crying in my car for what feels like hours. I’m so frustrated and honestly just at a loss for what to say and do. I cry and cry until I can’t breathe. Until I am gasping for air and my eyes are red and sweat drips down my forehead. I have never cried to my mom about anything except her. I wont lie, watching her shut down when I would try to confront her feelings time and time again became a habit of mine without me even realizing. I dont tell anybody how I feel. My guilt for not being better for her eats me alive everyday. I wish I knew how to help her,  and make her better. I often miss the protection I felt as a child when she trusted who I was enough to hold me, but I think that was only trust the innocence of a child could bring. I want my mommy so bad, but it is so hard for me to keep my faith in believing the lady I need is still in there, or that she ever was. I love my mom terribly, but it is so hard for me to like her. I try to remind myself everyday, she can’t help what she feels. That how she is isn’t her fault, but even with that, the little girl in me just cannot forgive her. I’m sorry for how lengthy this is, and sorry if there are any typos. ",1,1756602216.0,SchizoFamilies,0,1.0,False
