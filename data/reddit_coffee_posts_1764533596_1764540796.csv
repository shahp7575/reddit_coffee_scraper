1pav2c4,https://i.redd.it/517zl29axg4g1.png,"Review of Super Bright Mini COB Keychain Flashlight/bracket, Portable Rechargeable LED Light with Magnet for Work 1 Camping Emergency","[](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c4pT6oTT)

[View Product Page](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c4pT6oTT)

At $1.92, the listing’s 62 % discount from $5.05 already signals that we’re in the bargain-basement zone, where the only question is which corners were cut to hit that price. The product name alone ""Super Bright Mini COB Keychain Flashlight"" is a mouthful of buzzwords, but the specs are thin: no lumen rating, no battery size, no IP rating, and the images show a plastic body that looks like it could snap in a stiff breeze. Three orders in total suggests the market has already voted with its wallet, and the answer is: not very hard.

The discount is so steep it feels like a pricing psychology trick: the seller can claim a $5.05 ""original"" price, then slash it to under two bucks and still cash in. The risk, of course, is that the product is a lottery: it might work, it might not, and if it fails, you’re out the price of a coffee. The images show a USB-C port, but the description doesn’t promise a cable, so add another $2-3 for a cable if you don’t already have one. The magnet is a nice touch, but the listing doesn’t say how strong it is, so don’t plan on it holding anything heavier than a paperclip.

In short, this is the sort of impulse-buy that lives or dies on whether the gamble pays off. If it breaks, you’re out the cost of a candy bar. If it works, you’ve got a $2 keychain light that might just be the hero of the day when you need to change a fuse in the dark. Just don’t expect it to be the last flashlight you ever need to buy, and maybe don’t expect it to arrive in one piece if the shipping is as cheap as the product feels.

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

1pav1ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1pav1ef/35_m4f_connecticut_seeking_a_romantic_kinky_ltr/,35 [M4F] #Connecticut# – Seeking a Romantic / Kinky LTR in Southern New England Only.,"
Ahoy there, beautiful stranger.

If you’ve found yourself here, take a deep breath, settle in, and read on—I’m not the type to rush what could be the start of something truly special. 

I’m a 35-year-old switch male from Connecticut, seeking a genuine and lasting connection with a switch female in CT, MA, RI, or NY.

I’m not just looking for a fling or a quick fix. I’m looking for a woman who’s ready to be a true partner—someone who can match my laughter with her own, who loves the spark of chemistry but also values the deeper bond that comes from trust, honesty, and shared dreams.

I want a relationship where we can enjoy both the playful, passionate, and adventurous side of life and the softer, everyday moments—morning coffee together, holding hands on a walk, cuddling up on the couch while we game or read, and yes, plenty of heat and kink when the mood strikes.

💙 What I’m Looking For
• True Connection – built on emotional compatibility, shared passions, and a mutual willingness to invest in each other.

• Romance & Kink in Harmony – I want a relationship where the bedroom is a place of exploration and thrill, but the rest of our life together is equally fulfilling.

• Balance & Respect – While we’re together, I want to be your second priority—because your first priority should always be you: your dreams, your well-being, and your future. I’ll be doing the same for myself, because happiness starts within.

My philosophy of love is simple but deeply felt: Love is an offering, not a possession. When you care for someone, you don’t try to own them—you offer joy, comfort, and support, creating a space where they can thrive.

🌿 About Me
• Switch with Range – I’m comfortable and confident in both Dominant and Submissive roles, and I thrive on the natural flow of power exchange that comes from genuine compatibility.

• Dominant Side – Daddy, Wolf, Pet Handler, Master, Primal, and a bit of Sadist.

• Submissive Side – Pup, Little, and curious to explore more facets with the right partner.

• Personality – I’m loyal, protective, a little cheeky at times, and I like to keep things light and fun whenever I can. I’m a natural caretaker in relationships—whether that’s bringing you soup when you’re sick, making you laugh when you’ve had a rough day, or holding you close when words aren’t enough.

• Interests & Hobbies:
• Gaming – PC gaming, Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 & 5e), and fantasy worlds you can get lost in.

• Reading – Legend of Drizzt, Mistborn, Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Eragon, A Song of Ice and Fire, Harry Potter, and anything that stirs the imagination.

• Outdoors – Hiking through forests, bonfires under the stars, nature walks with good company.

• Animals – I adore animals and share my home with a yellow-belly slider turtle named Tokka and a mischievous cat named Munch.

• Communication Style – I believe that relationships thrive when both people are heard, valued, and respected. I’m a better talker than texter, but I’ll always make time for a good, engaging conversation.

🔥 Kinks & Play
I’m open-minded, passionate, and believe that kink should be fun, consensual, and safe. Some of my favorites include:

Pet play, primal play, switching, Mommy Dom/Little boy, Daddy Dom/Little girl, impact play, kissing, spanking, wolf play, roleplay, power exchange, lactation, collars, biting, clawing, butt plug tails, breastfeeding, age play, and aftercare.

With the right person, I’m always excited to discover new interests and explore your fantasies too.

❌ Hard Limits & Boundaries

• No hard-partying or daily heavy drinking.

• Not into BBW; preference for partners under 200 lbs and height-to-weight proportional.

• No hate, but I’m not seeking a trans partner.

• No Poly

• Please do not message me if you live in NYC, Long Island, Boston. Traveling to those places are a pain.

• Age Gap pluse or minus 10 years so 25-45 only.

• I am not a kink dispenser. Don't treat me as such.

💌 Let’s Make the First Move Count
If you’ve read all of this, start your message with:

""What music you’ve been jamming to lately""—and tell me a little about yourself: your age, location, and what you’re truly seeking in a romantic relationship.

I’m looking for more than just a partner—I’m looking for a co-adventurer, a partner-in-crime, a confidant, and yes… someone I can shamelessly flirt with and maybe drive a little wild when the mood hits.

So, if you’re ready for a connection that blends passion, romance, laughter, and genuine care… maybe it’s time to see if we can unlock each other’s next chapter.

My long-term boyfriend dumped me recently, so I’ve been having a rough time. Work and coffee have basically been keeping me moving.

I saw a Sony VAIO (SVF152C29L) in the ewaste pile at work and figured why not. It had a 1TB hard drive, 8GB of RAM, and some early-2010s CPU/GPU. Not great but worth a shot.

I got home, turned it on, and the whole laptop screen was just white. Plugged it into HDMI and Windows came up fine, so the internals were okay. Decided I’d just run it on an external monitor.

Since I switched my main gaming PC to Fedora, I wanted Linux on this one too. The problem was the VAIO wouldn’t show its boot menu on the second monitor, so I couldn’t select the USB drive.

Side note: a coworker/previous owner of laptop who’s a veteran had hyped this laptop up like it was loaded with “super advanced security features” and was “almost impossible” to install Linux on because he bought it off base. None of it was true. He just made up a bunch of stuff that didn’t make sense, and I didn't encounter anything he warned me about.

I flashed Nobara KDE on another machine and tried booting it. It would start the hard drive but nothing would appear on the external monitor. Tried several distros:

Nobara KDE

Fedora Lite KDE

Pop!_OS

a couple others

They all hit the same wall.

Then I remembered having issues as a kid where Windows Boot Manager blocked Linux. So I tried Zorin OS, and that actually got past it and booted.

I don’t like Zorin, but it at least installed. I set up PCSX2 and got the system running games.

Now I just want to switch the VAIO to something else, because Zorin isn’t what I want to stick with. I would like to use Nobara. Any suggestions to get past window boot manager?

1pav044,https://i.redd.it/5046o5lrwg4g1.png,Review of 2025 New Men and Women Starry Colors 18 Pieces Italian Charm Fit 9mm Stainless Steel Modular Bracelet Wholesale Jewelry,"[](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c30kfrYD)

[View Product Page](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c30kfrYD)

At $0.67 for 18 pieces, the unit price works out to about four cents per charm. That’s the kind of figure that makes you immediately suspicious of the metal being anything more exotic than the cheapest pot-metal alloy the factory had on hand the day they made the batch. The listing leans hard on ""stainless steel"" and ""Italian"" as code-words for quality, but at this price point you’re realistically looking at the thinnest possible electroplate over mystery metal.

The 7,272 orders are the only thing keeping this from being an obvious write-off. That volume suggests a lot of people are willing to take the gamble, or perhaps more likely, they know something we don’t. The 30% discount is a bit of a red herring; the original price was only 96¢, so the seller is not exactly signaling confidence in the product by knocking a third off the price.

The product name is a mouthful, but it’s doing a lot of work. ""Starry Colors"" and ""Italian Charm"" are the kind of phrases that sound like they should add value, but at this price point, you’re getting the absolute minimum viable product. The charms are probably printed on rather than any kind of inlay, and the ""stainless steel"" is likely to be the kind of alloy that turns your wrist green if you look at it funny.

In short, this is the sort of listing where the price is the story. The question is whether the risk of receiving something that looks like it came out of a Christmas cracker is worth the savings over going to a dollar store. The 7,000 orders suggest that for whatever reason, a lot of people are willing to take that risk. Maybe they know something we don’t, or maybe they just like the idea of getting 18 pieces of anything for less than the price of a coffee.

I've personally wasted countless hours brainstorming names, checking domain availability, and then getting stuck when the perfect `.com` was already taken. I figured there had to be a better way, so I decided to build one!

* **Infinite Feed of Ideas:** Just keep scrolling for an endless stream of unique, AI-generated name suggestions. No more hitting ""generate"" repeatedly!
* **TLD Control:** Filter by your preferred Top-Level Domains (like `.com`, `.io`, `.dev`, `.app`, etc.) so you only see what's relevant to you.
* **Style Filtering:** Want something ""techy,"" ""playful,"" ""professional,"" or ""abstract""? You can guide the generator to match the vibe of your project.
* **Domain Variations:** Found a name you love but the `.com` is gone? It can help you find variations of that name that *do* have better domain availability.
* **Instant Availability Check:** It checks domain availability in real-time as you browse.

1pauzbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pauzbh/urgent_2_week_pet_sitting_high_pay/,URGENT: 2 Week Pet Sitting - High Pay.,"For five years, I’ve been a professional pet sitter, a job that was once my passion. I’m Rover-certified, insured, and I have a 5-star rating that I guard with my life. Usually, the job is simple: walk a Golden Retriever with separation anxiety, or care for a cat that glares at me like I’m a war criminal. The weirdest pet I handled before was a Green Iguana named 'Godzilla', who had a fondness for being hand-fed raspberries.

Then, I got a message from Arthur. The subject line was deceptively ordinary:

URGENT: 2 Week Pet Sitting - High Pay. 

The house was a sleek, modern glass box overlooking the ocean. The duration was fourteen days. But when I replied asking about the animal, the response made me physically recoil.

“They are a colony of Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches. About fifty of them. They are low maintenance. I need someone to ensure humidity levels are kept stable.”

My finger hovered over the delete button. Hell no. I don't do bugs. I barely do spiders.

Then the follow-up message came through.

“Compensation is 10,000 dollars upfront.”

I stared at the screen. My student loans were drowning me, and my car was making a noise that sounded like a dying seal. Ten grand for watching bugs in a glass box? I couldn't turn that down.

I showed up at the house the next day. It was sterile, smelling faintly of bleach and lemon. Arthur opened the door, and the first thing I noticed was his eyes. They were a violent, bloodshot red, sunken deep into dark purple sockets. He looked like a man who hadn’t slept in a month. He scratched the back of his neck furiously, his fingernails digging into raw, red skin.

""Thank you for coming,"" he said, his voice raspy. He winced, gritted his teeth, and offered me a trembling hand. He led me to the living room. On the coffee table sat a massive, heavy-duty glass terrarium. Inside, a dark, shifting mound of black and brown carapaces moved sluggishly. There weren’t too many of them, maybe forty or fifty large ones.

""Humidity at 80%. I have fresh vegetables and oats set aside for them,"" Arthur said, rushing through the instructions as if he were holding his breath. He handed me a heavy brass key.

""Feed them every hour. Make sure to. And never leave them alone,"" he said before clenching teeth as his nails dug into his hand. He let out a long, shuddering sigh of relief. ""Take good care of them.""

And then, he practically ran out the door.

I locked up behind him and turned to the tank. I leaned in close. They were grotesque, their armored backs shining under the heat lamp. I checked the lid. It was heavy mesh with industrial clamps. It was shut tight. 

I crouched down and pulled open the cabinet doors beneath the tank stand. The shelves were stacked with gallon-sized Ziploc bags, each one stuffed with freshly chopped kale. Next to them were various frantic hand written notes. I grabbed the nearest bag and popped it open.

""Easy money,"" I whispered to myself.

I fed the roaches a handful of kale. My face wrenched at them as they fed. They scuttled over one another, hissing and snapping, fighting for the chunks of green. I glanced at Arthur's scribbled notes. Feed every hour. That sounded like overkill. A quick Google search confirmed that most of these colonies only needed food a few times a week.

""You guys can wait,"" I muttered. I wasn't about to be a butler to a box of bugs.

I finished up and headed to the guest bedroom. Arthur’s bed was absurdly comfortable, but the house was dead silent. Too silent. The quiet felt heavy, like it was pressing against my eardrums. I took out my phone, the blue light washed over my face as I doom-scrolled Reddit for about an hour.

Eventually, my eyes grew heavy. I put my phone on the nightstand and drifted off. 

A few minutes later, my eyes snapped open.

Scritch. Scratch.

It was coming from inside the walls. At first, I tried to ignore it, telling myself it was just the house settling or maybe a mouse. But it got louder. It sounded like thousands of tiny, dry legs rasping against the drywall.

I sat up, heart pounding, and turned my gaze toward the noise.

Instantly, it stopped.

I waited. Silence. I lay back down.

Scritch.

The night was unnerving. As the hours dragged on, the air in the room began to thicken. A smell drifted in from the hallway. It was pungent and earthy, like wet mud mixed with something sweet and sickly, like rotting flesh. The scuffling started again, weaving in and out of my dreams. Somehow, I managed to pass out from pure exhaustion, but it wasn't a peaceful rest.

I woke up feeling like I hadn't slept at all. My head pounded. I dragged myself out of bed and walked into the kitchen to make coffee, desperate for caffeine.

While the machine brewed, I glanced at the living room. The terrarium looked... darker. Fuller.
I frowned and walked over. The mound of bugs seemed to have doubled in volume. They were pressed against the glass, their antennae twitching frantically. Maybe they just woke up, I thought. Maybe they puff up or something.

I turned back to the kitchen and froze. There was a roach on the marble countertop. It was huge, the size of my thumb. I yelped, grabbing a paper towel. I crushed it, feeling it crunch underneath my finger, and threw it in the trash. My heart was hammering. I ran back to the tank. The clamps were still locked down tight. The mesh was intact.

""How the hell did you get out?"" I muttered.

I reached for the bag of vegetables to feed them, but my hand stopped halfway. My stomach curdled at the sight of them, they were pressed tight against the glass, their tiny legs scrabbling against it. I couldn’t open that lid. Not now. I felt like if I even cracked it an inch, they’d spill out through the mesh like an ocean. I turned away, desperately looking for a distraction. 

I opened the cupboard above the stove. It was nearly empty, save for a box of generic, store brand bran flakes. It wasn’t my taste but it would do. I ripped the cardboard tab open.

Dozens of small roaches were scrambling inside the box, climbing up towards the rim. I jumped in shock and reflectively hurled the box across the room. It slammed against the refrigerator, showering the floor with stale flakes. Just stale flakes.

Was I going mad?

The sight was still vivid in my mind, I couldn’t have just imagined it. My appetite had vanished. I didn’t want to be near the terrarium for the time being. I went about my day, headphones in, trying to pretend it didn’t exist. 

But by evening, the situation had spiraled into madness. 

I was sitting on the couch when I heard a sound. Like rain falling on dry leaves. Skitter. Click. Hiss. I looked down. A pool of roaches was spreading out from the base of the terrarium stand. It defied physics. There was no way that many bugs could fit in the tank, let alone squeeze through a locked lid. The black puddle grew, expanding across the white rug, moving toward my feet.

Panic, cold and sharp, seized my chest. I scrambled onto the couch.

""This isn't real,"" I gasped. The floor was disappearing under a carpet of black shells.
I fumbled for my phone. I needed proof. I needed to send this to Arthur or animal control or someone. I snapped a photo of the living room, my hands shaking so hard I almost dropped the device.

I looked at the screen to check the picture.

The floor was empty.

In the photo, the white rug was pristine. The terrarium sat quietly on the table. There were no roaches.

I looked up from the screen. They were climbing the legs of the couch. I screamed. I dropped my phone and sprinted for the bedroom. I slammed the door. Then shoved a chair under the handle, and stuffed a towel into the crack at the bottom. I sat on the bed with my knees to my chest, hyperventilating.

I was losing my grip on reality. I thought it could be carbon monoxide poisoning. Or stress. It just couldn't be real. I curled up under the duvet, praying that if I just slept, my brain would reset.

I was shaken awake by an unnerving sensation.

I felt a tickle at first, then it became a light frantic movement. On me. I threw the covers off and stood up, slapping at my arms. A roach fell from my elbow to the floor. Another fell from my hair.

But the tickling didn't stop.

It was deeper.

I felt a flutter beneath the skin of my forearm.

I stumbled into the bathroom, flicking on the harsh fluorescent lights. I looked in the mirror and screamed. My face was pale, but my eyes... my eyes were beginning to turn red.

I felt a sudden, violent heave in my stomach. I fell to my knees in front of the toilet and retched.

It wasn't bile that came up.

Three large, wet, hissing cockroaches splashed into the toilet bowl. They began to paddle frantically in the water.

My hands fell onto the sides of the toilet. I grasped for air. My throat still felt clogged. I looked down at my bare arms. Distinct oval outlines rippled through my skin... crawling through the muscle, tunneling under the epidermis, fighting for space.

It felt like a fire was lit beneath my skin.

I scratched viciously. My nails tore into my forearms, desperate to get them out, but that only made them burrow deeper. I rushed back to the bedroom and grabbed my phone. I dialed Arthur. It rang for a few seconds.

""Hello?"" His voice was clear. Well rested.

""You have to come back!"" I screamed, my voice breaking as I felt something crawl up the back of my neck, just under the hairline. ""I can't do this! I'm sick! Something is wrong with your pets! They're inside me!""

There was a pause on the line. I heard him take a deep, luxurious breath.

""They’re yours now,"" he said, his voice low with ice.

Click.

The line went dead. I dropped the phone and raised my hands to my neck, digging my nails in, and began to scratch. I drew blood, but the sensation of a thousand tiny legs churning beneath my dermis only intensified. I fell to my knees, sobbing, my vision blurring as the room seemed to fill with the chittering sound of the colony.

Then, through the haze of pain, a memory snapped into focus. Arthur's raspy, frantic voice: “Feed them every hour.”

I had ignored it. I had thought I knew better.

I scrambled up from the floor, gasping for air. I rushed toward the living room, wading through the sea of black bodies that covered the floor. They crunched under my bare feet, slippery and sharp, but I ignored the revulsion. I ignored the excruciating fire in my veins.

I grabbed the bag of kale from the counter and threw myself at the terrarium. The glass was vibrating.
With a scream of effort, I unlatched the clamps and ripped the mesh lid open. I didn't care if they swarmed me. I didn't care if they bit. I tore the kale into jagged chunks and hurled them into the mass of writhing shells.

""Eat!"" I shrieked. ""Eat it!""

The frantic hissing stopped. The colony turned as one, descending upon the greenery with terrifying violence. As they viciously ripped the leaves to shreds, the fire under my skin began to calm.

I watched as the last piece of kale disappeared beneath the swarm.

I blinked.

The room was silent. The floor was pristine white. The air smelled of lemon and bleach, not rot. I looked into the tank. There were no longer thousands of them. Just fifty or so large, sluggish cockroaches, munching quietly on their meal.

I collapsed onto the couch, watching them.

My phone alarm went off exactly fifty-nine minutes later.

I got up and fed them.

I stayed up the entire night, a slave to the second hand. Feed. Wait. Feed. Wait. It worked. As long as their hunger was satiated, they stayed in the box. By the time the sun rose, casting a beautiful orange light over the ocean view I couldn't enjoy, I realized the truth.

I looked at my reflection in the dark glass of the terrarium. My eyes were red. My skin was raw. I was exhausted.

Is this my life now? A prisoner to a glass box? I can’t live like this. I can’t live in fear of the swarm returning. I need to sleep for more than forty-five minutes at a time. And worse… I can't imagine what will happen if I leave them alone.

I grabbed my phone. My fingers hovered over the keys for a moment, trembling, before I began to type.

My long-term boyfriend dumped me recently, so I’ve been having a rough time. Work and coffee have basically been keeping me moving.

I saw a Sony VAIO (SVF152C29L) in the ewaste pile at work and figured why not. It had a 1TB hard drive, 8GB of RAM, and some early-2010s CPU/GPU. Not great but worth a shot.

I got home, turned it on, and the whole laptop screen was just white. Plugged it into HDMI and Windows came up fine, so the internals were okay. Decided I’d just run it on an external monitor.

Since I switched my main gaming PC to Fedora, I wanted Linux on this one too. The problem was the VAIO wouldn’t show its boot menu on the second monitor, so I couldn’t select the USB drive.

Side note: a coworker/previous owner of laptop who’s a veteran had hyped this laptop up like it was loaded with “super advanced security features” and was “almost impossible” to install Linux on because he bought it off base. None of it was true. He just made up a bunch of stuff that didn’t make sense, and I didn't encounter anything he warned me about.

I flashed Nobara KDE on another machine and tried booting it. It would start the hard drive but nothing would appear on the external monitor. Tried several distros:

Nobara KDE

Fedora KDE

Pop!_OS

a couple others

They all hit the same wall.

Then I remembered having issues as a kid where Windows Boot Manager blocked Linux. So I tried Zorin OS, and that actually got past it and booted.

I don’t like Zorin, but it at least installed. I set up PCSX2 and got the system running games.

Now I just want to switch the VAIO to something else, because Zorin isn’t what I want to stick with. I would like to use Nobara. Any suggestions to get past window boot manager?

Hey developers,

I've personally wasted countless hours brainstorming names, checking domain availability, and then getting stuck when the perfect `.com` was already taken. I figured there had to be a better way, so I decided to build one!

It supports:

* **Infinite Feed of Ideas:** Just keep scrolling for an endless stream of unique, AI-generated name suggestions. No more hitting ""generate"" repeatedly!
* **TLD Control:** Filter by your preferred Top-Level Domains (like `.com`, `.io`, `.dev`, `.app`, etc.) so you only see what's relevant to you.
* **Style Filtering:** Want something ""techy,"" ""playful,"" ""professional,"" or ""abstract""? You can guide the generator to match the vibe of your project.
* **Domain Variations:** Found a name you love but the `.com` is gone? It can help you find variations of that name that *do* have better domain availability.
* **Instant Availability Check:** It checks domain availability in real-time as you browse.

1pauu5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1pauu5g/is_8_seconds_worth_200usd_dunno/,Is 8 seconds worth $200USD? Dunno.,"So I'm heading off to Tokyo next week for a month long holiday. One of the side quest I have is to poke my head into some second hand electronic stores (not just the ones in the Akihabara tourist traps) to see if I can't score a Ser6 or other reasonable MiniPC. 

Research indicates local going rate is around the $200USD mark.

Then I stopped and thought ""am I just being silly? Do I *really* need to keep throwing money into this particular hole?""

Me being me, I decided to do some maths - 

My P330 tiny currently runs 4B model at around 16-18 tok/s and 8b around 8 tok/s. 

A nice Ryzen 7 SER6 should roughly triple that (45 and 24 tok/s respectively). 

Let's use the larger numbers -  16 vs 45 tok/s for sake of simple calculations.

I put the question to Kimi (still weening myself off cloud): just how much difference is there IRL between 16tok/s and 45 tok/s?

*****************************************************
Reading speed reality-check

Average adult silent reading: 200–250 wpm → 3.3–4.2 words per second. At 4.2 words/s a 200-word chunk needs ≈ 48 s.

Latency you actually feel
    16 tok/s → 200 tok ≈ 12.5 s of waiting.
    45 tok/s → 200 tok ≈ 4.4 s of waiting.

So the dollar buys you an 8-second disappearance of the “thinking” pause—roughly the time it takes to sip coffee. Whether that is worth AU $300 is personal:

    If you generate one answer, probably not.
    If you iterate prompts all day (coding, writing, chat loop), the saved seconds compound into minutes per session and lower mental context-switch cost—then the mini-PC pays for itself in sanity, not cash.

Bottom line: numerically huge, perceptually small; buy only if you hate waiting those extra eight seconds every single time.

*****************************************************

Thing is...as far as I can tell, that calculation *assumes* a cold pipe-line. So I re-framed the question ""ok, but what happens once the system is warm?""

*****************************************************
You’re absolutely right — once the pipe is warm you’re reading while it’s still being written, so the only human-noticeable difference is how far behind you are by the time you finish the paragraph.

Quick reality-math

    200-word answer ≈ 270 tokens.
    Your reading speed: 4.2 words/s → 48 s to finish the paragraph.

At 48 s the generator has produced:

    16 tok/s → 768 tokens (already 500 tokens ahead of you)
    45 tok/s → 2 160 tokens (miles ahead, but irrelevant)

So after the first two seconds you’re never waiting; you’re just consuming the buffer.
The perceptual gain is therefore:

    Colder TTFT (first 50-100 ms vs 150-200 ms) – invisible.
    Smoother cadence – 16 tok/s still feels like “instant words”; 45 tok/s just means the scroll-bar moves faster after you’ve finished reading.

Bottom line: once the stream is alive, 16 → 45 tok/s is almost entirely placebo for a human reader. Save the AU $300 unless you need the speed for batch jobs, API calls, or you simply hate seeing a slower counter.

Don't get me wrong...I'm still going to go (and probably buy *something* pretty) but it does sort of make me wonder if I shouldn't just save $200USD and sip more coffee.

being in Japan for 14 years, I'm always been into a good cozy darkish vibe coffee shop rather than generic ones that are bright ones.

I have my business plans 95% done and only left is execution, but I'd like to hear more about what people would want, just to validate my data more. I'd like to understand more on what is convenient for people to go even without a car.

for now, everything is under wraps but I'll drop a simple website I made.

🚚 10 years running a food truck taught me something important…

I thought social media would bring more private bookings.
One video even went viral with 2.3M views 👀.

But here’s the reality, the enquiries didn’t follow.
That was my turning point.

I realised what I actually needed was to get found where people are searching.
That’s when I learned how to get my website in front of potential clients – and everything changed.

Now I’ve launched Born & Raised Collective, a directory helping food trucks, dessert trucks & coffee trailers get seen and booked across Ireland & the UK.

👉 If you’re in the food truck or events business, let’s connect.

He hates the job that he has now. He works as a keyholder for a coffee shop. Whenever he's asked what he wants to do instead, he doesn't have an answer. He'll either tell you that he doesn't know, or he'll get really angry and lash out. My mom has even gone to a point where she's created an email for him and has applied to jobs on his behalf.

I am a decade younger than him. And I'm getting my masters degree in the medical field. I will get paid extremely well. I will never have to worry about buying a house, going on vacations, having good insurance. But it's stressful, you know? The weight of our family legacy is dependent on me. My mom is retired, she does consulting work but she doesn't get paid nearly as much as she used to. My dad is still working, but it's very clear he's burnt out from his job.

Yesterday, my family and I went to football tailgate. My brother got so drunk that he was unconscious for the entire game. He couldn't even walk by himself when he was going into the house. When I was helping him inside, he said, ""it's up to you"".",2,1764539850.0,BreadwinningWomen,0,0.75,False
1pauqai,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1pauqai/depressed_but_for_a_reason/,Depressed but for a reason,"So I am slipping into a dark depression but it’s because of my life circumstances right now. It didn’t just come out of no where which is usually the case for me. 

My wife and I have a 9mo baby girl. She’s the happiest sweetest baby that is a joy to be around. My wife and I both adore her. But my wife’s postpartum is really intense. She’s anxious plus she has C-PTSD and feels unsafe all the time. I also have C-PTSD but I’ve done a lot of work in therapy and don’t feel nearly as on edge as she is. 

My wife was spoiled as a child and still has droplets of this sense of entitlement. Like we live in a really small condo we own and she complains daily about our dogs hair that sheds and how small our place is. I just feel grateful to own something and don’t let the small space get to me. She spilled coffee this morning and it was like the world had ended. She has a lousy attitude about everything and it seems like she thinks she is entitled to an easy life. 

Everything bothers her and becomes something when it doesn’t need to be anything. 

I have a really good attitude and do well with accepting reality. I’m a new mom so I am accepting the fact that I’ll be tired until my kid moves out one day. That’s what happens to parents. They are chronically tired. 

My wife complains constantly. She is sort of on a bit of a high horse. 

It’s hard to partner with her because everything becomes something big instead of oh the kid put dog hair in her mouth I’ll swipe it out no big deal. 

It’s starting to cause me a lot of anxiety and I am starting to anticipate when she will spiral again and tell me we have to move to Canada because we are queer and unsafe. Or move it Michigan because of climate change. 

Maybe I’m not explaining myself right. But mainly everything can be a spiral at any moment. It’s the end of the world if our kid slips and bonks her head. 

I just want to be a team. Validate each other that it’s all hard and that we have each other to do it together. Sure our place is small but we are lucky to own. 

I have to be the stable one right now. I have to stay logical. But it’s hard when she is spiraling and always in a bad mood and in a PTSD response. 

How do I keep my depression from getting really bad? Because once I’m in an episode it tends to go hypo quickly then back to depression and back to hypo and it cause my wife more stress which puts more stress on me. ",1,1764539841.0,BipolarReddit,0,1.0,False

1paun9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1paun9i/aio_i_think_my_mom_is_narcissistic_and_abusive/,"AIO, I think my mom is narcissistic and abusive, but I have nowhere else to go and love her.","First I want to say thank you to the people who have validated me in my old posts, you really did help.

I, (15F) live with my mother (38), step father (46), and brother (16). We live comfortably, and I have no reason to complain. For years I grew up with my extremely physically and emotionally abusive father, and only earlier this year did my mother gain custody. He was  horrible man, and has been to jail for assault on a female (my mom), stealing, and a few other thing. I never want to go back to him, and my mother is my savior. I love my mother, I live off of her validation and praise, all I want is to make her proud. She literally saved me, but she makes me feel like the most disgusting thing on earth.

  
I'm big, I'm 5'3 and weigh 170-180 so I can see why she talks about it a lot, but she often makes comments on my weight, how much I eat, and how little I eat. I have an eating disorder (ARFIDS) and was diagnosed a year or two ago. I'm picky, I love a lot of foods but can't stand the textures of them when put together, cooked, etc. I give her a lot of trouble, we got into an argument last week (thanksgiving) when I got a third plate. I had just had my yearly physical, and the doctor said to watch my weight. She and my brother made snide comments, it really got to me so I walked away from the table and got into trouble. I tried to tell her that her comments hurt, but she explained that since we eat everything she has to say something- which I understand so after that I've been trying to only eat once a day so there's more food for everyone else.

  
She doesn't like being talked to in the mornings. If I knock on her door, she groans and yells, especially when I mumble or don't hear what she says. She critiques the way I dress, smile, talk, and even walk. Little things that I feel like I'm being dramatic about like the other day I cried after she yelled at me for leaving a dish to soak. A fucking dish. I cried over a dish. She recorded it and I feel embarrassed because she's probably going to send it to the family and it could've been avoided if I just washed the fucking pot. A lot of times she gets mad when I cry and laughs, especially after we get into arguments and she says hurtful things.

  
The day before thanksgiving she had a bag of pecans that I guess was full, but when she went to grab it it wasn't. She yelled at me and my brother in the car, mainly me because the weekend before I got grounded for 2 days for using the rest of the coffee creamer. Now maybe I misheard her, I don't think she's say this, but as I was crying she said 'you guys want to steal my food so much, I hope you fucking choke and 'unalive' on it'. I cried for hours after, because thats my mama. Sure we get mad, she says hurtful things all the time but I know she doesn't mean them. But this time, it made me thing, does she really want that? I can't tell anyone I know about this, we're in the middle of another court battle (my bio dad trying to get custody back) and I WONT go back to him, but why is my mom fighting so hard for me if she wants that?

  
All I want is for her to be happy. After the argument, it was never brought up again. We weren't grounded, she never mentioned it, and I'm not going to mention it either. For the last few days Its been all I can think of. My brother says I'm overreacting because my mom gets heated like that all of the time and its not like theres anything I can do, and i know he's right.

I came across the AeroPress and asked if he would prefer this - he likes the sound of it so has changed to now wanting this for his Christmas gift. We are both pretty new to coffee so not too fussy about how our coffee is made so long as it tastes good. My question is, do I get the regular AeroPress or the AeroPress go? Is the regular AeroPress portable? Which would you suggest for office/day out usage? ",3,1764539578.0,AeroPress,3,1.0,False
1paumhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/1paumhf/starting_a_small_edmonton_meetup_discord_board/,"Starting a small Edmonton meetup Discord — board games, bouldering, movies, arcades, casual hangs","Hey everyone — I put together a Discord for local meetups in Edmonton. I just didn't find anything and I've been looking to get some hangouts going but being new to the city, I haven't made too many friends who don't have familial obligations or their own friends already.

If anyone else is in the same boat, maybe this server can be helpful too!

Not a giant spammy server, not a dating group, not a drama pit. Just normal people wanting to actually hang out.

**What I'm looking to do:**  
• Board game nights (Hexagon, Table Top, Round Table)  
• Bouldering (Factory, Rock Jungle)  
• Rec Room / arcades / bowling  
• Movies, food spots, coffee meetups  
• Walks, gym sessions, whatever people want to host

**Why I made it:**  
I haven't found any local groups that actually engage or focus on hanging out irl.   
This one’s built around *real in-person events* and keeping things simple.

If you’re down to meet new people, join here:  
[**https://discord.gg/gcrDvBJweG**](https://discord.gg/gcrDvBJweG)

You’re welcome to just lurk until you see something you like. Mods, please let me know if this is okay, I don't see it violating any direct rules and my goals are just to get community engagement. I'm open to further convos if you guys are amenable to helping me connect the community here in Edmonton!",7,1764539577.0,Edmonton,0,0.89,False

1paukrr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1paukrr,"Iseul, South Korea - A fictional city built by yours truly 🎈","I started this build in november 2023, so it's taken almost exactly two years! the only reason I consider it ""finished"" is because I've maxed out my plot data sadly. you can see in the photos that for a lot of buildings, I had to fill windows with lightboxes because of this. unfortunately I also couldn't tour every building cause of reddit's 20 image limit, but I'll probably make a video tour next month.

the first building I completed was pianotopia, a quaint little music store slowly going out of business. you can see this on the left in the first slide!

the final building I finished was the auto repair shop seen on the last slide.

Iseul is set in the 2000s during a transition period between old and new technology, which is also noticable throughout the city. I also used bloxburg's existing tech company, NYX, as an opportunity to have their headquarters located here. (the fat TVs in bloxburg have NYX on them)

this is the proudest I've been of a bloxburg build, but I also don't see myself building cities again. I pride myself in my ability to detail, and this city already took two years, so I'll probably be sticking to smaller builds from now on.

**tips for your own city builds:**

\- invest in transform+

\- create your own decals

\- copy buildings off of google maps

\- never use plastic, always use snow for texture

\- experiment

\- don't burn yourself out (i took a 6+ month break which is probably why it took 2 years)

I pulled these rankings together by looking at what people are actually saying on Reddit and in Amazon reviews. I try to spot patterns across a lot of comments what gets consistently praised, what breaks, what’s easy to use, and which machines people actually recommend after living with them for a while.

If anyone wants to see the full data, you can check it out here: [Coffee Makers](http://redditrev.com/categories-list/Coffee-Makers)

The rankings update based on recent Reddit threads and new Amazon reviews, and I use semantic analysis to get a clearer sense of sentiment instead of relying on one-off posts. The #1 pick doesn’t mean it’s perfect for everyone, but it does mean it gets the most consistent positive feedback overall.

1pauiwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso_decaf/comments/1pauiwc/follow_my_experiment_in_decaf_storage_freezing_vs/,Follow My Experiment in Decaf Storage: Freezing vs Shelf,"I keep having bags of decaf go stale on me pretty quickly - they lose flavor, crema, body, etc. While this is somewhat expected and I did try vacuum storage and freezing loosely to try and combat it, I never really got a clear picture of how freezing did at retaining flavor because my trials weren't really done with proper storage or side-by-side, like-for-like comparison.

**Why Do This? Isn't Freezing Obviously Better?**  
Well, to be honest, the last time I tried freezing this decaf, I must have done something wrong because it turned out tasting like bland vegetables. Really unpleasant vs on the shelf, but I froze it glass tupperware with a rubber seal so maybe it got compromised. I also didn't single dose, which means that moisture entered the container every time. So this is a chance to improve the storage as well as compare to shelf storage in a more structured way.

**Beans:** [St. Frank Decaf Ubuntu](https://www.saintfrankcoffee.com/products/burundi-ubuntu-decaf) \- my favorite decaf, with a really nice chocolately body when brewed as a ristretto, perfect for me and my wife's daily lattes.

**Recipe & Equipment**: I burned 4-5 shots dialing in the newest bag I got, resulting in a 21g in, 24g out in about 25-30 seconds. This is the same recipe I'll use for every brew, though I may adjust grind if I feel that both samples need it. I'm grinding with a Timemore Sculptor 064S and brewing/steaming with a Bambino Minus.

**Samples:** After dialing in, I had about 178g of coffee left in the bag, enough for roughly 4 shots each with some left over. Less than I thought, but it'll do.

**Storage**: 4 doses will be stored in the valve bag on the shelf. We live in a mild climate but have a poorly insulated old house, so we might be running the heater a bit. The shelf isn't high, so shouldn't really be at over 75F ever. For the freezer, I bought[ these freezer-safe 4oz baby food containers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP56HJN1) that I'll be keeping in a Kirkland freezer-safe ziploc bag. I couldn't use centrifuge tubes because the readily available sizes (50ml) only hold about 16-17g of coffee and I regularly dose much higher than that. I did see 100ml tubes but they looked... sketchy.

**Method**: We usually take about a month (often less, depending on how much we are home) to go through a bag as we also have some other decafs usually and/or are drinking cafs as well, so that's a good timeframe for the experiment. I certainly felt that the longer we kept the decaf the bigger the difference we should see between the two storage methods, and a perceptible difference was important to have an outcome. But also, this is the timeframe we are most likely to use the coffee in, so for our purpose, spreading the 4 shots out over the month made the most sense.

The only strange bit is that we are going on vacation for 2 weeks, so I pushed the last shot out quite a bit for the day after we get back. This has the added benefit of giving an extra long gap to see how the beans develop over time, so I was fine with it.

I am going to test these in 8oz small-ish lattes, which is what we mostly drink. Yes, I know - I should be trying them as straight 'spro for the most clear comparison, but for my household, flavor in milk is the result that matters. Sorry!

**Dates** **& Results:**

|Date|Event|Result|
|:-|:-|:-|
|11/19/25|Roast||
|11/25/25|Bag open, dial in, freeze||
|11/30/25|5 Day Comparison|Freezer dose definitely had more flavor, perceptible even through 6oz of milk on top. It also had noticeably thicker crema, which I enjoy. I expected this result further down the line, but it's a bit wild that just 5 days is enough to see a very large difference in taste.|
|12/5/25|10 Day Comparison|TBD|
|12/10/25|15 Day Comparison|TBD|
|12/28/25|33 Day Comparison, Return from Trip|TBD|

Would love to know your thoughts! I'm sure there are many ways I could improve the integrity of the results and the comparison, but for me as long as I get a firm answer on how to store my decaf, I'll be happy. Plus, it's fun!

Him (33 M) & I (24 F) have been dating for nearly 2 years , living together for the majority of this time .
He has made it a consistent habit to be on his phone around me 98% of the time, like an iPad kid , particularly when it’s football season . 
I have continued to ask him to please be more present by maybe getting off of his phone when we are on outings , maybe saying good morning to me instead of just sitting next to me in on his phone laughing , while he sees me looking at him. (He responded “Well, you didn’t say good morning to me …”), and walk next to me instead of ahead of me constantly. 
We have gotten into SEVERAL arguments about this , him calling me sensitive , me feeling like he is being emotionally absent and dismissive of me and our quality time together .
He works from home and I have a very intense blue collar job 8-5 nearly each day , so whenever I come home to try and intentionally spend time with him and he acts as if he has better to do (such as scroll on his phone , or hide out in the office) , my resentment and sadness continues to grow . 
This morning , he was on his phone (as always) and wanted to rush out of the house to go to the gym. 
I just needed to put my shoes, so I asked him to please just wait one second. As I put them on;  he told me that I was too sensitive and he was allowed to go get his coffee alone. He left without me to go get coffee . I cried . 
Often I am met with the response of being “overdramatic, too sensitive, etc” while I think he is being quite the opposite , not sensitive enough. Emotionally absent even. 
I have spoken to friends about this and all have told me I am not in the wrong for feeling this way , but at the end of the day they are biased . (maybe)

I’ve been unwell for about four months. After being sick for three months straight, I finally took a Covid test, it was negative, but I think I did it very late.

I also have a history of an eating disorder, and while I’d kept it under control, the last two months have been rough. I suddenly can’t tolerate most foods. Even looking at some things makes me nauseous. I almost stopped drinking coffee (which I loved), can’t eat my usual meals, and the only things I can handle are burgers, fries, chips, and chocolate.

I know this isn’t sustainable or healthy, and on top of that it absolutely sets off my body dysmorphia. Almost everything else makes me sick, though. I’m constantly stressed because I’m terrified of gaining weight, which obviously isn’t helping.

Whenever I try to eat something “not-burger,” it doesn’t satisfy me, leaves me nauseous, and then I still end up eating something else afterwards, usually chocolate or chips. 🤦🏼‍♀️ My gastroenterologist just told me to “slowly reintroduce healthy foods,” which didn’t really help.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How did you get back to normal eating?",1,1764539113.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False
1paufez,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1paufez/i_fucked_up_and_lost_the_person_i_loved/,I Fucked Up and Lost the Person I Loved,"I’m a 28-year-old woman, and the past few years of my life have been an emotional rollercoaster. I spent five years in a codependent, toxic relationship with someone I’d describe as narcissistic. Two of those years, I’ve been in therapy, and therapy helped me break free and regain my life.

After starting to heal, I met a guy at work—let’s call him Lewis (28M). We started going out, but it was casual: dates, coffee, cinema. No real intimacy. While seeing Lewis, I also started talking to another guy, Peter (28M). I was essentially talking to and spending time with both, but never committed or intimate with either.

Eventually, I stopped seeing Lewis but stayed friends with him. Peter and I began spending more time together, and it became clear he wanted something serious. I wasn’t ready—I was still in my “single” era and didn’t want to commit too soon. His pushiness triggered memories of my previous toxic relationship, so I held back, argued, and acted distant.

Peter and I were on and off for 7–8 months. We eventually became intimate, but our arguments continued, mostly because of my avoidant behavior. While we were broken up, I’d text and meet with Lewis, and eventually became intimate with him too. For the last two months, I was seeing both of them simultaneously. I didn’t feel good about it and hated myself.

Through all this, I realized I was completely in love with Peter. Despite the arguments, I wanted to be with him, share my day, and connect emotionally. I never felt that way with Lewis.

Just as I was about to end things with Lewis and commit to Peter, he found out about the situation—through a Reddit post, of all things. He broke up with me, saying he considers what I did cheating and can no longer trust me. I told the truth to Lewis too, but I honestly don’t care about his reaction. My focus is Peter.

Peter wants no contact and made me promise not to try to convince him to get back together. I plan to respect that, even though I’m dying to reach out. I feel completely broken inside.

These past few years have been mentally and emotionally exhausting. I know I’m responsible for my actions, but I don’t know how to cope with the heartbreak. It feels like I’ve lost the person I could’ve had a future with.

How do I breathe again? How do I survive this without contacting him?

**TL;DR:**  
I got out of a toxic 5-year relationship and started seeing two guys, Lewis and Peter, at the same time. I was emotionally unavailable and avoidant, eventually becoming intimate with both. I realized I truly loved Peter, but he found out about the situation and broke up with me, saying he can’t trust me. He wants no contact, and I promised to respect that, but I feel dead inside. How do I move on and breathe again?",1,1764539086.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Toki pona is really fun to learn anyway. Translating a song is my go-to ""learning a new language"" project.
I noticed toki pona and asl share the need to make a lot of vibes based choices. Which I really like, haha.

I'm posting because I'm going to hire a singer to record it, then make a sitelen pona lyrics video to go along. And then I wanna send it to Artimus!
So I'd like it to be very polished.
So I'd like to get some editing help, with a focus on toki pona grammar and making the lyrics fit the timing of the music.

Particularly in the lines that contain lawa and lon, as I have been saying those wrong this entire time, as I was working with text that made l and I look exactly the same... Thanks to reddit having different font than my notepad, I literally just now realized realized it's pronounced lah-wa and lawn, not eyawa and eon. So those lines are gonna need an extra syllable somewhere haha. Although some of them might have been kinda squished in the first place, so could be good to have less?

I am asking for opinions and suggestions.

Without further ado, here's what I have so far:

There were a few mornings where I made my own, but most days she made the coffees and neither of us realised the decaf bag was at the front of the cupboard.

By the end of that second week the withdrawal was so bad I was genuinely considering going to the hospital. The dizziness, migraines and nausea were brutal. At that point I still had no idea it was caffeine withdrawal.

Saturday morning I went to make a coffee, saw the decaf bag sitting there, asked my wife, and sure enough she’d been using it the whole time. Suddenly everything made sense. I had a normal coffee and felt noticeably better.

Now the reason I’m sharing this:
I actually do want to quit caffeine. I don’t like being dependent on it. Part of me thinks I could have pushed through if I knew what was happening, but I had too many responsibilities and felt too awful to function.

So if I quit on purpose and go cold turkey, what do the next few months realistically look like?

So I let her out, then turned around to make a cup of coffee... Then my phone rang...

I happened to glance out of the upstairs window and there's my dog, walking in circles in the snow.

I raced downstairs to let her in. She was SO happy to see me, and so wet and so cold! 🥶

Of course I dried her off & gave her all the pets and hugs, a huge cookie treat and cuddles as I sobbed like a fool!

1pauci1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pauci1,What kind of art/furniture style is this?,"This is a coffee table I inherited from my mother who inherited it from my grandfather. Unfortunately both are gone now, and I'd like to have the artwork under the glass top restored and converted into a wall-hung piece, as it is sentimental to me rather than functional and therefore very difficult for me to keep as-is in my relatively small house. When I mentioned this plan to my grandmother she said she thought she had been told it had originally been artwork that was turned into a coffee table, but she also only ever saw it as a table, so I can't be sure. What I know about this table:
- Came from my grandfather's family in Queens, NY.
- Both of my grandfather's parents were first generation immigrants from Ukraine. It is extremely unlikely to have come from Ukraine with my great-grandfather, but it is possible it came from Ukraine with my great-grandmother.
- The artwork and glass top is 33"" diameter, the table is 36.5"" diameter. It sits 17"" off the ground.
- The artwork is not attached to the back of the glass top, it is applied to the substrate and the glass top is set overtop it.
- There is no maker's mark or signature that I could find.
- Age is unknown, but must be a minimum of 80 years old based on family timeline.

I can't even figure out what kind of style this is. I've tried reverse image searching but none of the results really look like this. Any help identifying the style or school would be extremely helpful in my quest to find someone to restore it.",2,1764538886.0,whatisit,1,1.0,False

Hi all,

Picked up my car last week and I’m still getting to know all the options but love it already.

Came from a P2 performance which I drove for almost 4 years.

The ‘mods’ on the 5N are the H&R -15mm performance lowering springs, the additional led trunk lights, the small ‘N’ decal inlays on the sideskirts and a matt anti fingerprint screen. I also had the letters IONIQ removed from the trunk but kept the ’N’.

Considering a dashcam and possibly the carbon wrapped ’Veloce’ bodykit.

N settings left custom 1 is the same as the regular full N but with smoother damping. The left custom 2 is my ‘rain’ setting with a mix of sport/normal but with full esc on.

The right N button is for e-shift with sound. Don’t use the sound without shifting as i find it a bit annoying.

Star on the steering wheel is for the N menu. Star on the dash for the EV menu. The media button always seems to go directly to my Carplay menu so no need to dedicate a star button to it.

Still figuring out how to disable the coffee break message and how to select the carwash tile. Sometimes it’s right there in the main menu but most of the time it isn’t haha. Other thing i noticed is that Waze sometimes gets ‘juddery’ and not running smooth. Wireless or wired doesn’t make a difference.

I’m sure I’ll come across some other things during the next weeks.

Looking forward to spring to get some real performance numbers in and see if it‘s as fast as the blue matte test car I drove a couple of months ago. And to take some decent photos. This one is a quick shot from this morning in an Amsterdam parking.

Looking forward to the topics here. Since there are only 100 ’N’s in The Netherlands the Dutch forums are a bit limited.

By the end of the week, Evan had developed a new routine—one that had nothing to do with earnings reports or chart patterns.
He’d wake up, check futures just long enough to reassure himself the world hadn’t collapsed overnight, and then walk—sometimes practically jog—to the café. It wasn’t efficient. It wasn’t disciplined. It wasn’t anything a good trader would do.
But he did it anyway.
Maya always seemed to spot him before he reached the counter.
“Black coffee, no indicators?” she’d call out with that teasing grin.
He started ordering cappuccinos he didn’t even like just to see what tiny drawings she’d make in the foam: a cartoon bull, a tiny sunrise, once even a little stick-figure trader clutching his head. He saved that one on his phone. “For motivation,” he told her. Really, it was for something else.
One morning, near the end of the month, Evan arrived early. The shop wasn’t open yet, but Maya was inside, adjusting chairs and humming a song he didn’t recognize. He hesitated—he didn’t want to seem strange or overeager—but before he could turn away, she noticed him through the glass.
She unlocked the door, breathless from moving tables. “You’re early,” she said, then lowered her voice. “I like that.”
He stepped inside, feeling the warmth of the café wrap around him like an embrace.
“Rough morning?” she asked.
“Honestly… not really,” he said. “I just wanted to be here.”
Her eyes softened. “Me too.”
Something fluttered between them—not loud, not dramatic. More like the gentle shift of a market before a breakout, subtle but unmistakable.
Their conversations deepened over the next few weeks. He learned she’d taken the barista job to support her art dreams. She learned he started trading after a layoff that had shaken him more than he liked to admit. He’d never told anyone that—not even friends. But with Maya, words seemed to fall out of him before he had time to second-guess them.
One afternoon, when the café was quiet, Maya wiped her hands on her apron and leaned over the counter.
“Can I ask you something, Evan?”
His heart skipped. “Sure.”
“You come in every day. You stay even when your phone is buzzing like it’s trying to escape your pocket.” She tilted her head. “Are you… running from something?”
He paused. His instinct was to laugh it off. To deflect. To keep things breezy.
But she deserved honesty.
“Maybe,” he said softly. “Or maybe I’m running toward something.”
Her expression shifted—gentle surprise, then something warm and hopeful.
Before she could respond, Evan’s phone chimed. A piercing market alert. The type that usually sent adrenaline racing through him.
He silenced it without even looking.
Maya blinked. “You’re not going to check that?”
“No,” he said, eyes on her. “I’m exactly where I want to be.”
For a moment, neither of them moved. The world outside passed by in its usual blur. But here, in the tiny pocket of warm wood and coffee steam, time stretched out—soft, delicate, full of possibility.
Then Maya smiled, slow and radiant. “In that case… want to help me taste-test a new syrup flavor?”
He laughed. “Only if you promise not to draw another panicking day trader.”
“No promises,” she said, bumping his shoulder lightly as she led him to the back counter.
Evan had always believed the market rewarded patience, discipline, and logic.
But standing beside Maya—sticky countertop, mismatched mugs, her laughter ringing like morning bells—he realized something else:
Sometimes life rewarded the people willing to step away from the screen.
Sometimes the best trades weren’t trades at all.
And sometimes the clearest signal wasn’t on a chart—it was in a smile.",1,1764538720.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I have some routines and habits that sometimes make me wonder if I possibly have OCD, but I feel like I don't quite meet the criteria.

This is my typical morning routine:

\-before I get out of bed, I do the wordle (this is random, and if I break this habit I think things would be okay)

\-wake up very early (4ish). when im on vacation/staying with friends i try to wake up about 2 hours before everyone else so i can finish my routine in peace before they wake up

\-get dressed, brush teeth. drink water and coffee. read at least 50 pages of a book.

\-poop (this is the hardest part because it's not directly in my control). most of the time it happens after coffee though.

\-when all that's done i can continue on with the rest of my day

I think that's a solid and healthy routine. The problem is that if something happens to limit me things get very hard. In the vacation example, I will spend a lot of mental energy worrying about where my coffee is going to come from (is there a coffee machine? how doss it work? do i need to buy coffee? will i wake everyone else up when i make the coffee? what if someone else gets to it before me?) until it resolves itself.

I also struggle sometimes with cleanliness, health, and eating. But again, those are all good things. But I do get super anxious about random things, like yesterday I felt a bump in my mouth and worried for at least an hour that I had an std despite not having had unprotected sex ever in my life, or sex period in several months.

I like to check and recheck things. I'm currently looking for a new job so spend about 2 hours a day looking at different jobs, even though I have several months before my current contract even expires.

I also constantly seek reassurance. Whether it's by Googling things, asking people their opinions on things, or things like this very post.

I was once on a weekend trip with some friends. We were planning to take a bus ride back on the last day, and busses weren't running. I spent about an hour confirming that there were no busses, because we were expecting there to be. We had to stay an extra day and I started panicking because I hadn't planned for an extra day, didn't know if I had clean clothes, wasn't prepared to do my morning routine away from home again, etc. I started ranting about the lack of busses and my friend nicely suggested I might have ocd- she said I reminded her of a relative she has who is diagnosed with it.

  
I also set super high expectations of myself and get obsessed with things easily. My new year’s resolution this year was to run a 5k and I just ran a marathon.

The air recycled through the vents smelled of ozone and stale coffee—the universal scent of bureaucracy working past midnight. He had been waiting for three hours. He had been stripped of his phone, his watch, and his wedding ring.

When the door finally opened, it wasn't a soldier who entered. It was a man in a rumpled charcoal suit, carrying a single black folder. He looked like an accountant who had just calculated the date of his own death.

""The Department of Energy?"" Elias asked, eyeing the man’s badge. ""I’m an exo-archaeologist, Director. I dig up bacteria fossils on Mars. Unless you found oil in the Valles Marineris, I don't know why I'm here.""
Vane didn't smile. He sat opposite Elias, placing the folder on the table. He didn't open it.

""We aren't here to discuss fossils, Doctor. We are here to discuss a specific psychological threshold."" Vane pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, ignoring the blinking smoke detector above them. ""Tell me, in your work, have you ever encountered a truth you couldn't process? Not a puzzle you couldn't solve, but a fact that made the tools of solving it useless?""

Elias frowned. ""Science is about processing facts. There is no such thing as a truth that can't be withstood.""

""That is a comfortable assumption,"" Vane said, lighting a cigarette. The smoke drifted lazily toward the vents. ""But we have a term for the moment that assumption fails. We call it ontological shock .""

Elias leaned back, crossing his arms. ""I've heard the term. It’s usually applied to indigenous tribes seeing airplanes for the first time.""

""It is much more than that,"" Vane corrected softly. ""It is the psychological dissolution that occurs when an individual—or an entire civilization—encounters information that fundamentally invalidates their prevailing model of reality . It is distinct from fear, Doctor. It is distinct from panic . Panic is a biological reaction to a predator. Ontological shock is the disintegration of the 'self' and the 'world' as intelligible concepts .""

""You're talking about the UAP hearings,"" Elias said, trying to regain his footing. ""The whistleblower testimony. Grusch. Elizondo.""

Vane tapped ash onto the pristine floor. ""The public thinks those hearings were about national security. They think we are worried about Russian drones or Chinese hypersonics. Even the optimists think it’s about nuts-and-bolts spacecraft visiting from other planets to conduct diplomatic surveys .""

Vane’s eyes locked onto Elias’s. They were grey and utterly devoid of hope.

""But the emerging narrative points toward possibilities that are metaphysically and psychologically far more destabilizing . The truth isn't that we are being visited, Elias. The truth is that we are not the authors of our own history .""

Elias felt a cold prickle at the base of his neck. ""What are you saying?""

""I am saying that the foundational axioms of your existence—time, space, human agency, and the sanctity of consciousness—are about to be revealed as false or manipulated constructs . And when that happens, the human mind struggles to maintain coherence .""

Vane slid the black folder across the table.
""Open it.""

Elias hesitated. The folder was heavy, the cardstock textured like skin. He flipped the cover.
There were no photographs of flying saucers. No blurry gun-camera footage. The first page was a transcript, heavily redacted, stamped ONTOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT // LEVEL 5.

""We asked a question,"" Vane said, his voice drifting through the smoke. ""Years ago, we asked a specialized AI to assess the existential threats posed by Non-Human Intelligence. We didn't ask for military scenarios. We asked for the truth humanity wouldn't be able to withstand .""

Elias scanned the document. Phrases jumped out at him, clinical and horrifying. ...eradication of meaning... ...metaphysical incarceration... ...humanity is not at the top of the food chain...

""This isn't intelligence,"" Elias said, his voice trembling slightly. ""This is philosophy. It’s a hypothesis.""
""It’s an assessment of the architecture,"" Vane countered. ""The data we have collected—from crash retrievals, from biological samples, from high-level whistleblowers—suggests a reality that renders human ambition, religion, and scientific achievement functionally irrelevant .""

Vane leaned forward, the smoke curling around his face like a veil.

""Elizondo called it 'somber' and 'sobering' . Do you know why? It’s not because they have better weapons than us. It’s because the data implies we are a mere byproduct of a cosmic industrial process .""
Elias looked up from the file. ""A byproduct?""
""Or a resource,"" Vane said. ""Or a prisoner.""
Vane stood up and walked to the wall, where a digital screen flickered to life. It displayed a taxonomy of threats, a chart that looked like a business plan for a slaughterhouse.

""We have categorized the threats based on the nature of the violation they impose upon the human psyche ,"" Vane explained, gesturing to the screen. ""At the bottom, you have physical predation. The 'Dark Forest' scenario. The idea that the universe is a hunter-gatherer ecosystem where silence is survival .""

""I know the theory,"" Elias said. ""If you shout in a dark forest, the wolves eat you.""

""We are the ones shouting, Doctor,"" Vane said. ""But that is just the physical threat. That triggers fear. We can handle fear. Fear makes us build weapons.""
Vane pointed higher up the chart.

""The real danger is the eradication of meaning . The metaphysical threat. The 'Zoo Hypothesis.' The 'Prison Planet.' The idea that human consciousness is trapped to harvest emotional energy .""

Elias laughed, a sharp, nervous sound. ""You're talking about 'Loosh'. The concept from Robert Monroe. That’s esoteric literature, Vane. That’s not science.""
""Is it?"" Vane turned back to him. ""If you discovered a cow had a philosophy, would you stop milking it? Or would you simply ensure it never found out about the slaughterhouse?""

The room seemed to tilt. The hum of the air cycler became a roar in Elias’s ears.
""You have evidence,"" Elias whispered. It wasn't a question.

""We have bodies,"" Vane said. ""And we have the math. We have analyzed the silence of the cosmos, Doctor. The Fermi Paradox isn't a paradox. It’s a sign of lurking danger . The universe isn't empty. It’s hiding.""
Vane returned to the table and stubbed out his cigarette. The crushing finality of his movement signaled the end of the preamble.

""We need you, Elias. Not to dig up the past, but to help us understand the owners of the property. Because they are coming back. And the Somber Truth is that we are not the residents of Earth . We are the tenants. And the lease is up.""

Elias looked at the folder again. The words seemed to swim, rearranging themselves into a sentence he didn't want to read but couldn't look away from.
The danger is not merely physical extinction, but the eradication of meaning .

""What do you want me to do?"" Elias asked, realizing with a sick certainty that his life as a civilian—as a man who believed he owned his own thoughts—was over.

""I want you to turn the page,"" Vane said softly. ""And I want you to try not to scream.""

1pau3e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1pau3e8/is_a_smart_plug_worth_it_for_energy_saving/,Is a smart plug worth it for energy saving?,"Smart plugs have gotten pretty popular lately, and you might be wondering if they actually help save money on your electric bill. Let's break down whether a smart plug is really worth the investment.

## What Smart Plugs Actually Do

A smart plug sits between your wall outlet and whatever device you're plugging in. You can control it from your phone, set schedules, and turn things off remotely. The main way they help with energy savings is by stopping ""vampire power"" – that's when devices suck up electricity even when they're turned off or not being used.

## Where You'll Actually Save Money

Here's the thing: smart plugs work best with certain devices. They're great for things like coffee makers, phone chargers, gaming consoles, TVs, and desktop computers. These gadgets keep drawing power even when you're not actively using them.

If you plug a smart plug into your coffee maker and schedule it to only have power during morning hours, you're cutting out all that wasted energy for the rest of the day. Same goes for entertainment centers – those things can drain 5-10 watts constantly just sitting there.

## The Math Behind It

A typical smart plug uses about 1-2 watts of power itself. So you need to make sure the devices you're controlling actually waste more energy than that. Good news is that most standby electronics do. An unused cable box might waste 15-30 watts, and a gaming console can pull 10-15 watts even when ""off.""

You can check out options at [athomewave.com/smart-plug](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug) to find models that fit your needs and start monitoring your energy usage.

## Beyond Just Saving Energy

Smart plugs offer other benefits too. You can turn off forgotten devices from anywhere, which prevents waste and reduces fire risk. You can also make your home look lived-in while you're away by scheduling lights to turn on and off.

The convenience factor matters too. Setting schedules means you don't have to remember to unplug things manually. Your devices automatically power down during times you never use them anyway.

## Is It Worth It?

For most people, yes. If you use smart plugs on 5-10 devices around your house, you could save $50-100 per year on electricity. The plugs themselves usually cost $10-25 each, so they pay for themselves within a year or two.

The best candidates for smart plugs are devices that draw phantom power, things you forget to turn off, and appliances you only use at specific times. Skip using them on devices that already have zero standby power or things that need to stay on 24/7.

1pau3a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CADAI/comments/1pau3a1/why_small_design_teams_benefit_the_most_from/,Why Small Design Teams Benefit the Most from Automation,"I remember sitting in a tiny engineering office years ago where our entire design team consisted of me, one junior engineer, and a guy who technically wasn’t even in engineering but somehow ended up helping with drawings because he was good at computers. Those were the days when a single complicated part would derail our entire week. If a senior engineer got pulled into a meeting or a customer visit, the whole workflow froze. Nothing moved unless someone pushed it manually.

Small teams know this pain better than anyone. You are doing design, checking, documentation, supplier calls, fire fighting, coffee refilling, and occasionally fixing the plotter because nobody else will. So when people talk about automation, small teams sometimes assume it is a luxury for big companies with big budgets. In reality, it is the smaller groups that feel the improvement the fastest.

One of the biggest advantages is bandwidth. Big teams already have layers of specialists who can pick up slack. Small teams do not. If one person is stuck dimensioning drawings or generating repetitive variants of a design, that is a chunk of engineering time that disappears. Automation acts like a silent extra team member who does the boring parts without complaining. I have seen small teams cut their documentation workload in half just by removing repetitive manual steps.

Another benefit is consistency. Small teams rarely have someone dedicated to maintaining standards and checking drawings. That means the only thing standing between a clean process and a messy one is whoever is the least sleep deprived that week. Automated routines help keep things uniform. Views are consistent, dimension styles match, notes stay accurate, and you do not end up with four different title block formats that nobody remembers creating.

Then you have the learning curve problem. In a small team, if one experienced engineer leaves, they take a big chunk of tribal knowledge with them. Automating repeatable parts of the process captures some of that experience. It is not perfect, but it reduces the shock when a junior engineer suddenly has to handle tasks that normally belonged to someone with fifteen years of scars.

I also noticed that small teams tend to innovate faster once they automate the tedious stuff. When people are not buried in click click drag tasks, they start experimenting again. They try new design approaches and run more iterations. Automation buys mental space, and mental space usually leads to better engineering.

If you have ever worked in a small design team, you probably know how often each person ends up doing the work of three roles. That is why the smallest groups actually feel the biggest impact when they automate anything at all. Even shaving off ten minutes per part becomes a major deal at the end of the week.

Curious to hear from others in small teams. What part of your workflow do you think would make the biggest difference if it were automated?",1,1764538261.0,CADAI,0,1.0,False

## 🏥 **A Small Mountain Town Faces Big Changes After Clinic Closure**  
In **Churchville, Virginia**, a quiet rural community of just **200 residents**, life has shifted dramatically since the closure of its only medical clinic—an outcome local officials say is tied directly to President Donald Trump’s sweeping legislation, the **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (HR 1)**.

Where neighbors once walked to see their doctor, patients now face long wait times, distant appointments, and difficult travel. The loss is reshaping daily life in a town nestled beneath the Blue Ridge Mountains.

## 🚪 **Local Residents Feel the Impact of Losing Essential Care**  
For longtime resident **Teresa Leach, 56**, the closure has been jarring.  
With asthma and limited local options, she’s been struggling to find alternative care:  
> “For just a well-being appointment, the soonest is the end of January.”

Leach—who voted for Trump—sipped her coffee inside the MTN. Mystic shop, only feet from the now-dark clinic entrance.

Others, like an unnamed woman who supported **Kamala Harris**, drive **over an hour** to Charlottesville for treatment. She says rural health care has always been fragile, but this closure was especially devastating for her husband. Still, she avoids displaying political signs:  
> “Because of the environment.”

Across the street, political tension is visible. One storefront window reads:  
**“Thank you Trump. Save America Again.”**

## 💸 **How Trump’s Megabill Reshaped Rural Health Systems**  
Rural clinics—many dependent on Medicaid—were already strained before HR 1 brought **hundreds of billions in federal health cuts**, along with stricter:  
- Work requirements  
- Eligibility checks  
- Administrative hurdles  

Augusta Medical Group cited these “new realities” when shutting down clinics in **Churchville and two nearby towns**.

Democrats hope to spotlight health care in next year’s midterms, but places like Churchville highlight a difficult truth: rural areas deeply supportive of Trump remain skeptical of Democratic messaging.  
Trump carried Augusta County by nearly **50 points** in 2024.

## 🗳️ **Democrats Struggle to Break Through in Rural America**  
Physician **Jena Crisler** ran for Virginia’s House of Delegates and lost by over **40 points**, despite a Democratic statewide sweep. She says Democrats can’t abandon these areas:  
> “I think they’re going to be even more concerned when it starts hitting them personally.”

Rural organizers like **Lynlee Thorne** of Rural Ground Game say face-to-face conversations still matter:  
> “There’s nothing that can replace that person-to-person conversation at your doorstep.”

Meanwhile, national and state Republicans—including **US Rep. Ben Cline**, who voted for the bill—have not publicly commented on the closures.

## 🌍 **A Democrat Who Won Says Health Care Messaging Still Matters**  
Pediatrician **Mark Downey**, who flipped a seat in Virginia’s 69th district, argues Democrats must persist on health care:  
> “When people start seeing loss of access and services… eventually it becomes more of a hardship.”

After two previous losses, Downey’s win suggests the message can resonate—slowly.

## 🗣️ **Voices From Churchville: Divided Perspectives**  
Some residents are speaking out:

### **Those Who Blame Trump**
**Irene Holmes, 59**, moved from New York seeking peace after losing her son. With chronic health challenges, she depended heavily on the clinic.  
When asked who was responsible:  
> “Absolutely Trump.”  
> “What he’s done is destroying rural areas.”

### **Those Who See It Differently**
Others, like **Dale White**, a church administrator, say fears are overstated:  
> “These are old-time rural farming folks… they’ve been going elsewhere for care since they can remember.”

The divide reflects a larger national split—one where health care, geography, and political identity collide.

---

## ❓ **FAQs**

### **1. Why did Churchville’s clinic close?**  
Augusta Medical Group cited financial pressures tied to HR 1, including steep Medicaid cuts and stricter requirements.

### **2. How far must residents now travel for care?**  
From **20 minutes to over an hour**, depending on specialty or availability.

### **3. How are politics shaping reactions?**  
The town leans heavily Republican, creating a politically sensitive environment around the closure.

### **4. Are Democrats focusing on rural health?**  
Yes. Organizers aim to rebuild trust via door-to-door outreach and local events.

### **5. Will more rural clinics close due to the bill?**  
Health experts warn that communities heavily reliant on Medicaid may face additional closures.

I've never actually created a post here but often comment in discussions.

This question is important to me to get an idea of where to go beyond just buying great decafs in general. Here in Australia espresso is the norm, so I usually need to develop more (at least for our blends) and filter roasts are a bit more niche.

Regardless, I come back after having going overboard on the December order, fresh and ready to put November behind me with one final post. So let's once again combine the last two packages and go over the many goodies found within them...

[Package 2.2.1](https://preview.redd.it/myc0fo4veg4g1.jpg?width=3543&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c03200a605b3b846f5c116cdd3c8c708b4b55ddb)

Apologies for some of my image quality. I was in a rush. Today's haul brings *Dark Explorers* down for the count with the addition of Blissey and Accelgor to the collection, and moves *BREAKThrough* and *XY* closer with the addition of their respective Zoroarks. Other than that, there's a ton of fun prints from mostly the BW and XY era, so with that in mind, let's go over some of my personal favorites of the lot.



**1. Clefairy (Generations 50)**

[Illus. Shibuzoh.](https://preview.redd.it/0px35mrffg4g1.png?width=2361&format=png&auto=webp&s=d37ca3afbb9c6ad5d01e38f68db4012e9a4bc453)

A fun aspect of these older lots is not just the really cool prints, but also those with a bit of history behind them. I do need to figure out how I'm gonna approach *Generations* as the final boss of the XY Era given all the pumping that's gone on, but for now we'll log Clefairy into our collection and call it a day. This print holds particularly significance though, as its the first ever print from one of my personal favorite artists on the TCG, Shibuzoh. It's quite the remarkable start too with its playful, textured style that really sells this almost dreamlike aesthetic that fits well into the cosmic origins of our subject. Always interesting seeing how different artists depict the night, and I think the more non-traditional use of lighter blues here work really well. It gives a sense of a really bright moonlit night, drawing your attention to the moon and tying into the history of Clefairy in a very playful way. It's also a rare Fairy-type card which is always a fun trip down memory lane and a reminder that I've been doing this for too long.

  
**2. Paras (Generations** **6)**

[Illus. Aya Kusube](https://preview.redd.it/wnav9bldgg4g1.png?width=2361&format=png&auto=webp&s=e94c3ce767a3128f4e0b9d57587c2e750f89ed89)

Gen 6 is really where I feel Aya Kusube started to ascend into the upper echelons of Pokémon artists with prints like one of my all-time favorites, Elgyem from *BREAKThrough*, and this lovely Paras. So glad to finally add this one to my collection. While most Pokémon cards love to get us up and close with our subject, the pulled-back composition here gives this lonely feeling to the piece as our subject looks out into the rain storm its currently sheltering from. These kinds of print are surprisingly risky given how the card's subject needs to be instantly recognizable from a quick glance. To this end, Kusube leverages the contrast between the greens of the foliage and the reds of Paras to make it an easy centerpiece that is easily discernible even from a distance. The Paras line doesn't get a ton of love in the TCG, but for this one brief moment back in 2016 it got the justice it deserved.

  
**3. Shiftry (Next Destinies 72)**

[Illus. match](https://preview.redd.it/jgm2n9wlhg4g1.png?width=2361&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4ebee768a99bb3050a8a101d0e8a720fa759f75)

Shiftry is a pretty classic match print from the early BW era that has quite a history to it. Shiftry was once a banned card in the Expanded format, being used with the Forest of Giant Plants stadium card to be an absolute menace on Turn 1 with the right set-up, leading to its ban from the format. The trouble didn't stop there though, and eventually Forest of Giant Plants itself was deemed to be problematic and banned from Expanded. Shiftry was freed from its false imprisonment and hasn't been particularly viable since then, but for its small stint in the halls of infamy it will make for a really cool addition to the collection.

  
**4. Panpour (Next Destinies 28)**

[Illus. Reiko Tanoue](https://preview.redd.it/mfhhenddig4g1.png?width=2361&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bc7b76ab5dd4478d979c694a2d18ec17a7d1d72)

I talk a lot about the OG artist of the TCG and the many now familiar names that built the TCG into what it is today, but it's sometimes worth taking a side tangent and looking at those contributors whose runs were a little... less pronounced. Reiko Tanoue printed twice across the entire TCG, first with Sceptile from *Arceus* and then with Panpour here. Their contributions aren't much, making the really creative use of Panpour here standout that bit more. I love the imagery of Panpour using it's head... hair(?) to pour steaming coffee into a cup. Reiko's texturing and colorful line work remind me a lot of what Shibuzoh. would achieve with their run, but with far more muted colors and less lively compositions. The result is possibly my favorite Panpour print and that's a good legacy for an artist whose footprint is so small.

  
**5. Zoroark (BREAKThrough 91)**

[Illus. kawayoo](https://preview.redd.it/2iroyzu3kg4g1.png?width=2361&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca14dadfbdf1e1ed4f2f22349fb77b72a94b9ed)

There's a few cards that pictures don't do justice and honestly this amazing Zoroark is one of them. kawayoo's oily style is one of the best out there, and is at its best when he can go wild with lighting. The holofoil pattern works so well here in a way I wish I could get across better in pictures, while the strong highlights complement the shadowy composition and give it that little extra pop. It's a piece that would have been a absolute treat to pull back in the day, and will continue its life as a crowning jewel of my growing Zoroark collection.

  
**6. Duosion (Plasma Blast 43)**

[Illus. match](https://preview.redd.it/lopu1mfzkg4g1.png?width=2361&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f2ff4e10a07d1f1d76e3c49a1823daa656d04b6)

The Solosis line is another guilty pleasure of mine. They're so fun to see every time they print and I've wanted this fella for the binders for a while. match's style is always fun and the fix of lighter greens and cooler blues just come together so nicely. There is something to cards set in recognizable locations too, and so seeing the Strange House once again brings a smile to my face. One can just imagine the location swarming with Solosis and Duosion as it does in the game, and that the furniture might just be thrust your way by these mischievous psychics as we see with the lamps here. Just a fun piece that brings me back to my nostalgic memories of the Gen 5 games and everyone's favorite butt jelly Pokémon line.

  
**7.  Ferroseed (Next Destinies 77)**

[Illus. match](https://preview.redd.it/8utwtxd3mg4g1.png?width=2361&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5f3ae21b1123b7404c78b7bbb1955a8a1940af9)

Let's finish this off with a match hat trick. As I mentioned in my [Black Bolt & White Flare write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1m4awv0/top_10_bulk_cards_of_black_bolt_white_flare_so/), Ferroseed is such a tough Pokémon to depict given its very static nature. Hasuno's print from that set might be my personal favorite, but that comes with the understanding that match's *Next Destines* print put up quite the fight to retain its title. I just love the imagery of Ferroseed lodging itself into the walls of the caves it inhabits haphazardly with no care in the world, as well as wondering what's going through the head of those other Ferroseed who look a lot more fully submerged in the cave wall. I have many questions, but I'll keep them to myself. The light from the entrance backlights our subject to help separate the foreground and background and the winding tunnel doubles to give depth to the piece and keep it visually interesting even with an... inert subject such as our demon Lego here. Goes without saying, but this is yet another banger to add to the halls of my binders.

...

With that, another month of Mail Days come to an end. I was also able to get my hands on the Illustration Contest promos when doing my Christmas shopping which was quite exciting as I thought that ship had long sailed, though they ended up missing out on the photo here. December was going to be a lighter month, but with all the pulls I've seen people posting I couldn't help myself and went a little more overboard. Lot of cool stuff coming down the pipeline to end the year including a few big guys that I'm excited to hopefully finally cross off the checklist. 

If you've made it this far, thank you for indulging me as a gush some more about bulk cards and that I could offer some respite from all the Charizards flooding the sub. Let me know your thoughts on the cards I highlighted here as well as some of the others I didn't get to specifically call out (they're all so wonderful). What beauties has the mailman brought you this month and what are you looking forward to them bringing in the next one?

Until next time, happy ripping, and remember: when you're chasing commons, every pack is a God pack.",39,1764537932.0,PokemonTCG,0,0.96,False

Looking for friends, and everything that comes with that.

Staying up all night and telling each other bad jokes, long talks about life, trying to solve together the mysteries of the blood, to find a way to return to the innocence, and definitely find the way out of the labyrinth of life. Looking for someone with whom we share our lives, someone who's gonna be there when everyone else leaves, someone who's gonna be the shoulder (and I'll be theirs) when we cry.

1patxn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MelodyEverAfter/comments/1patxn0/eat_your_heart_out_part_ii/,Eat Your Heart Out: Part II,"Three months later, I was unpacking my dorm at CSU. I had decided it was best that Lila and I didn’t dorm together at Central State. She had wanted to, *begged* even, but after all the fights we had been having, I told her it was probably better if we had separate spaces. Central State University was in Silkwood Creek, so Lila lived at home and commuted to her classes. Her parents didn’t trust her to be left alone after the *worm incident.*
I was staying in the Advanced Placement Dorms, which were basically apartment-style quads that had a cluster of four primary bed-and-bath combos around a small, shared living space. So while I did, technically, have roommates, we rarely spoke to each other in the beginning. After a few weeks of classes, I began to venture out into the living room to socialize with the other girls. My roommates were named Nova, Kaia, and Riley.
Nova was a softball player. We didn’t have much in common. And Riley was going into pre-med, so she was always busy with homework. Kaia and I were both liberal arts students. While I was studying communications, Kaia was going into theater. Sometimes, we would play video games together on her Xbox or get coffee at the campus coffee shop.
 I had promised Lila that since we weren’t rooming together she could come over any time she wanted. Sometimes after swim practice, she would shower at my place, hang out in my room, vent about therapy or something dumb Marcus had done, or tell me about her classes, but it always felt shallow. Lila wasn’t healed, and she was only doing it to make everyone “perceive” that she had gotten better. I found it frustrating. 
Lila had tried to come to her senses but needed a lot of help. She was still swimming, but she had to see a therapist for her eating disorder three times a week for the first few months of college, so she was often out of reach. As her therapy continued, Lila became more and more distant. I wasn’t mad about it. I did want her to get better…And I know this is wrong, but after seeing her like that—angry, shriveled up, broken, and shitting all over me—I was kind of glad she stopped coming around so much. I felt like I had this moral duty to protect her, help her be happy, even. But who was there to protect my happiness? She didn’t have my back, and having hers twenty-four/seven, after months of being treated like a second-class citizen, was exhausting. 

Lila never even apologized for screaming at me in the locker room that day, never thanked me for helping her when she fell out. She didn’t apologize for the way I had been humiliated while the swim team visually violated my body when I was trying to save her. And worst of all, she didn’t really seem sorry for doing all of that to herself. 

Sure, she was in therapy and had gained a little color back to her cheeks, but her green eyes were still hollow underneath. I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was being forced to get better, not actually recovering for the benefit of herself or the loved ones around her. And it wasn’t my responsibility to see that she did. I spent months doing all that I could. There was nothing else I could do to help her. That’s when I began going out on my own. I went to club meetings and GA parties. Kaia even started to come with me sometimes. It was fun to have a friend who didn’t know everything about me. I got to tell her about myself and learn all sorts of things about her too. Like how both of her parents were drama teachers, she competed in e-sports in high school, and she had started the first-ever special-needs theater troupe in her hometown. Her little brother had cerebral palsy. Her favorite restaurant was an Indian fusion place. 
By learning about Kaia, I also kind of felt like I was learning about myself. Who was I other than Lila Black’s best friend? I was Jordan Sinclair. A communications student. A swimmer on the CSU swim team. I liked video games, karaoke, sushi, and reading sci-fi books. I might have liked all those things before, but for the first time in my life, they came first. And that felt good.

One night, after swim practice and Lila had visited, Kaia and I were hanging out in her room. I was lounging on her bungee chair while she played Fortnite on the floor beside me.

“Kaia, you know I love watching you lose Fortnite for hours on end, but we should go out and do something,” I said, nudging her with my foot.

“No parties tonight. There’s nothing to do around campus except drink, and I’m not really in the mood,” she replied. “You’re the one from Silkwood. What do you like to do around here?” She closed the game.

“Fuck around in parking lots, mostly. Spend money I don’t have at Target.” I sighed. A sneaky grin inched across Kaia’s face.

“What about ghost hunting?” she asked, only half-sarcastically. I raised an eyebrow at her. *She couldn’t be serious.*

“Are you literally twelve years old?” I laughed at her.

“These girls from drama heard about this abandoned church camp in the woods not far from here. They said it was shut down because the director murdered a bunch of kids there in a satanic ritual back in the 2000s. We should bust in.” She rose to her knees and put her hands on my shoulders. Her smile was infectious, but I couldn’t help but laugh at her eager expression.

“They’re fucking with you. That’s not what happened.” I snorted at her. Kaia’s smile faded.

*“Fuck*… No abandoned camp?” She whined as if Christmas was canceled. 

“No, there is a camp, but if I tell you what really happened there, you’re going to be sorely disappointed.”

“Shoot.” She sat back on her heels.

“It wasn’t the 2000s. It was, like, the 2010s. When I was like fourteen or fifteen, word got out that the director of the church camp and one of his pervy counselors set up cameras in the girls cabins. Freaks were arrested for distributing child porn. No one sent their kids back to the camp after that, and they went bankrupt. It’s been closed ever since,” I said.

“Oh…That just sucks.” Kaia cringed. 
I kicked her playfully.

“You’re the one who was excited about sacrificing kids to Satan literally less than a minute ago.” I laughed. Kaia giggled and rolled over onto her side.

“Yeah, but let’s be real. That was more fun because I didn’t actually think it was true. What happened to the kids?”

“The girls who got recorded?” My stomach churned, but I shrugged. “Nothing really came of it. You know how those churchy people are. People like… *prayed for him.* The guy was arrested, and that was that.”

“You’ve got to know something to do around here,” she whined at me.

“Okay, fine.” I said. “There is one place we could go. But it’s not very exciting.”

“Where?”

“Waffle House.”

“Ew, Waffle House?” Kaia laughed.

“It’s not *‘ew.’* It’s the heart of our country. Have you even ever been?” I asked through giggles.

“I’ve heard stories…” She trailed off. We put on our shoes and jackets and began to make our way to the parking lot. That’s when I noticed them for the first time. 

Across the lot, a gaggle of three women stood in the streetlight. They were walking away from the quad complex. I know it was wrong of me to notice them just because of this, but there were two women who appeared average, and one of them was completely bald. Again, I’m not one to judge, but the second thing I noticed about them was their mismatched clothing. Bright neons contrasting against burgundies and gray sweatpants in the lamplight, like they had handpicked their outfits from a lost-and-found bin. 

They were pretty far off. I wasn’t sure why, but a strange feeling pooled in the bottom of my stomach. Something about their movements were mechanical. They slipped into the darkness, just out of my range of vision, when we got into Kaia’s car. 

“Ground control to Major Tom,” Kaia joked.

“Yeah, I was staring again,” I said, buckling into my seat. 
…

The local Waffle House glowed like a Christmas bulb as we approached. The big fixtures illuminated the steamy glass exterior, lighting our pathway to the most mediocre meal Kaia would ever have in her life. I felt honored to be the one to bring her here. Her parents weren’t the type to take their kids to a place like Waffle House. It was much too worldly for them. When I opened the car door, the faint buzz of the flickering sign came into earshot.
We sat at a table, freshly wiped down by a woman named Teresa, who brought us both coffees in thick ceramic mugs fit for kings.

“This place is pretty great,” Kaia said. “It’s like the opening scene of *Pulp Fiction,* if it was even stickier.”

I laughed, “Yeah, Lila and I used to come here after swim meets for team dinners. We’d always share an All-Star Special.”

“So, you gonna tell me about her?” Kaia asked with a smirk.

“About Lila? You’ve met her.” I took a drag off my coffee cup.

“Well, yeah. Before you slam your door and you two hide up in your room for a few hours after swim. Is that your girlfriend or something?”

“Ew, gross!” I laughed. “She’s my best friend from high school. She’s basically family.”

“Well, I knew that, but every time you talk about her, you get all misty-eyed and mysterious, like she’s your whole world.” Kaia snorted. I sighed.

“She used to be. We were like sisters in high school. Closer than close. I was kind of like her dorky sidekick. But then she started getting all weird when we joined swim. She got pretty deep into an eating disorder. Taking all sorts of witchdoctor shit and swallowing cotton balls.

Things kind of got out of control when she got ahold of some tapeworms and crashed out after a swim meet. I just can’t be around her all the time anymore.”

“Woah…That’s pretty heavy. Like, real tapeworms?”

“She passed out in the locker room from not eating for days and shit all over me. I’m pretty damn sure they were tapeworms.”

“Oh my god…What the *fuck?”*

“Yeah, she gets therapy or something now, but I don’t know. I’m really trying to just do my own thing. I feel bad but… I just can't help her anymore.”

“Hey, that’s not your fault.” Kaia grabbed my hand. “I know it’s not really the same because my brother was born with it, but I spent my whole childhood trying to help him in physical therapy. Started a troupe for disabled kids, hoping he could make some friends. But I wanted to study theater, so I had to let that all go. One thing I’ve learned is that you can love the people you care about, but you can’t wear yourself thin trying to save them. What’s meant to be will be, you know?”

“Yeah, you’re right about that.” I looked down at Kaia’s hand, intertwined with mine.
Her thumb lazily brushed the side of my hand, and she was smiling at me. A rush of embarrassment swept over my shoulders, and I pulled my hand back slowly. Kaia’s smile faltered just a little before Teresa sat a plate of waffles between us. 
The rain began to swell outside, drumming against the windowpanes, so we killed time by doing all the “Waffle House” things, we played the corny Waffle House Mix on the jukebox to the dismay of the rest of the patrons, made diner pets, and I even told her about the secret code they use to put in orders. At some point, before we finished our meal, I made sure to wrap my jacket securely around my crossbody bag so the water wouldn’t soak my computer. I figured I’d forget later.

We finally split our waffles and the bill before making a run for the car. Kaia yelled over the thunder. 

“You know, running through the rain actually leaves you the same amount of wet as walking through it does. You still get hit by roughly the same amount of raindrops!”

“Yeah, that’s great, Kaia,” I said, furiously jiggling the car door handle. “But if I walked through the rain, I’d still be spending more time in it.” I busted into the car and plopped down into the seat. 

Kaia started it up and turned on the windshield wipers. “I’m sorry for jumping to conclusions earlier about you and Lila,” she said. 

“What?”

“That you guys were a thing. That was kind of crazy.”

“Oh, that’s fine. You’re not the first,” I muttered, falling over my words. Kaia bobbed her head, her lips quirking up into a small, lopsided smile. 

“Fair enough. But you’re not just Lila’s sidekick, you know. You’re Jordan. And Jordan’s pretty cool.” She nudged my shoulder with hers, playful but gentle. The car felt smaller, the air thicker, like the natatorium before that dive. My heart did a weird flip, not unlike the moment I had stood on that high dive, Lila’s voice egging me on. But this was different. There was no chlorine sting, no crowd waiting for me to crash. No stakes. Just Kaia, with her damp hair curling against her neck, her smile glowing warmly, not unlike the Waffle House lights. 

I wanted to say something clever, but all I managed was, “You’re not so bad yourself.”

She laughed. “Woah.” The sound was warm, cutting through the storm’s drone. “High praise from Jordan Sinclair.”

I don’t know who moved first—maybe it was me; maybe it was her—but our lips met, soft and warm, tasting faintly of coffee and maple syrup. It wasn’t like the movies, all fireworks and certainty. It was a little clumsy, my glasses bumping against her cheek, and I felt her smile against my lips; a quiet promise that this wasn’t just a mistake. We pulled back, foreheads touching.

“Okay,” Kaia said, her voice shaky with a laugh. “You were right. Waffle House is pretty cool.”

“I told you!” I laughed when Kaia pulled the car into drive and headed back toward the quads. The windshield wipers thudded rhythmically on the windshield. Kaia had paused to look for traffic when a sharp tapping on the back window rattled us both. I screamed, and Kaia jumped in her seat. We turned around. An elderly man stood there in the rain. Kaia threw her car into park and cracked the driver’s side rear window just enough to hear him.

“I’m strapped. Don’t try anything funny, or I shoot. What do you need?” she asked, motioning for me to get something out of her glovebox. 

I reached down and pulled out a handgun. My eyes bulged.

 *Damn, Kaia!*

I passed her the weapon and Kaia held it up so he could see. The man was short and balding, with a wide grin that looked convincingly innocent.

“Woah, there! …Smart girls!” he cooed with a chuckle. “I don’t blame you. I didn’t mean to scare you ladies, but one of you left your bag inside.” He held up something to the glass. My heart leapt from my chest. It was my crossbody bag.

“Oh my god!” I yelled over the storm. “That is mine. Thank you so much for bringing it all the way out here!” 

“No trouble at all!” The man crossed behind Kaia’s car to my window, and I rolled it down so he could pass it to me. “There you are, Jordan.”
 
*My heart froze over like ice. *
“What did you just say?” I asked him. His hands were still on my bag, and I peeked at him around it. He froze for a moment, like he couldn’t hear me too well. There was a look of puzzlement on his face before a metaphorical lightbulb clicked on above his head and he was washed over with cheery laughter.

“My apologies. I looked at the tag on the inside. *This bag belongs to Jordan?* That’s what’s written in there on the inside flap.” He grinned, pushing the bag toward me. I laughed sheepishly…*Okay.*

“Oh, I see. Thank you,” I said to the man. It was still odd, but at least my heartbeat had begun to return to its normal pace. Still, something lurched inside of me. It could have been the ambient glow of streetlights, but the man’s expression was inexplicably strange. His fingers lost their grip on the leather bag and readjusted. This time, he laid his hands on top of mine. 

I jolted backward and yanked the bag into the car, but his arms remained outstretched. When I pulled the bag inside, his fingertips drug across the skin of my hand with a clammy, damp touch.

Kaia rolled up the window and began to pull away before he could say anything else.

“He scared me for a minute there. When he said your name, I almost shit my pants.” 
 Kaia laughed as we drove off.

“Dude, how do you think I felt? If you wouldn’t have been armed, I would have pissed myself. Thank god he brought it all the way out here, though. My computer was in there…” I trailed off.

*My computer was in there. That’s right. *

I could have sworn I had wrapped my bag up in my jacket before I left so the water wouldn’t seep through. Speaking of which, where was my jacket? I looked around in the car for it. It must have fallen off in the restaurant when I left the bag behind? But that didn’t make any sense. Something was off. Maybe it was the rush of kissing Kaia that had gone to my head or just how badly I had been trying to shelter from the rain. 

Minutes passed, and Kaia had turned up the radio for us to sing along to. She handed me her gun to tuck back into her glovebox. When we got to the quads, the rain had begun to fade into just a sprinkle. I exited the car and started to gather up my things.

“That’s a nice look you’ve got going on there, Chewbacca,” Kaia teased.

“Chewbacca?” I laughed. “Are you calling me hairy?”

“No.” She giggled and pointed at my shirt. “I’m talking about that sick-ass bandolier you got going on. It’s rugged. I like it.” 

“Bandolier? What are you talking ab—“

Her laughs continued, but when I looked down, my stomach sank. The “bandolier” was just the strap to my leather crossbody. The strap was detachable so it could be interchanged with a shorter, handheld one.

*I didn’t leave my bag in the restaurant. That freak unclipped it from the strap while I wasn’t looking.* I started to feel sick.

“Kaia, we need to get inside. C’mon.” I grabbed up my detached crossbody with one hand and Kaia’s wrist with the other, pulling her inside the complex, and I didn’t let her go until we were inside the dorm, with the door locked behind us. 
I knocked on Nova’s and Riley’s doors to make sure they were both home, conducting a brief headcount, before shoving the sofa against the front door.

“Are you going to explain to me what’s going on?” Kaia asked in a huff of panic and frustration. I yanked the crossbody strap away from my chest and jiggled it at her for emphasis.

“I didn’t leave my bag at Waffle House. It was strapped to me. That fucking creeper pickpocketed it off of the strap, checked it for my name, then followed us back out to the parking lot to give it back.” 

“What the hell?” Kaia said, her face turning pale.

“Dude, yes. Look at my strap. There’s no way I accidentally unclipped it.”

“Are you sure it didn’t like… *I don’t know,* get stuck on a chair or something and break off?” she sputtered.

I picked up the strap and clipped the bag back onto it, giving it a tug for good measure.

“Does this look broken to you?” I snapped at her. It came out meaner than it should have. Kaia didn’t appear mad, just scared. She placed her hands over her mouth and inhaled sharply.

“Jordan…he went through your bag.”

“Yeah, I know, *I know—”* I breathed, exasperated. Kaia was staring at me like I had seven heads. “…What?” I asked, nervously running my hands through my hair.

“We gotta look through the bag,” she said coldly.

“Oh no…” I groaned. My stomach churned, like the sick drumming of an unbalanced washing machine. I picked up the bag and laid it on the coffee table. We pulled out the items one by one: my computer, my wallet, Chapstick, my headphones, my mouse pad and mouse, a couple of bags of crushed Funyuns from the bottom, and a whole handful of wadded-up paper.

“Well, looks fine…Unless you’re particularly opposed to Funyuns. Then I have questions.” Kaia laughed and put a hand on my shoulder. It was funny, but I didn’t laugh. “Other than that, looks like there’s nothing creepy in there, at least,” she said. But something was off. Computer, accessories, wallet, Chapstick, snack… *the dorm key.*

“Kaia…” Tears were welling up in my eyes now. “The dorm key is gone.” I shuddered. Kaia looked at me with an expression of seriousness. “Are you sure? Let’s look around here somewhere and make sure you didn’t misplace it…”

I shook my head and pointed to the wallet, which had a key ring fastened to it. It glinted in the light, as if to mock me.

“No. It was on that key ring. It had the apartment number tag on it and everything.” I was shaking now. My breath was entering my lungs faster than I could push it out.  

“Okay. Don’t panic. I’m going to wake the girls up and help them block the windows in their rooms. Go take a breather, shower off, and I will handle this. First thing in the morning, I'm going to call the housing department and have them help me change the locks. Then we will go to Lowe’s and grab some motion sensor alarms for the windows. It’s all gonna be okay.”
I learned very quickly that Kaia was no force to be reckoned with. She didn’t fool around when it came to getting things done. Like she always had a good plan. I did as she said, taking a brisk shower, but I was too afraid to take up too much time in there for fear of getting sliced up Norman Bates style while I washed my hair. 
When I was finished, I went into Kaia’s room. She had her wardrobe pushed in front of her window and her gun on her nightstand. Kaia hopped up out of bed and used a ratchet strap from move-in day to tie her door handle to the doorstop, then hung some spirit week bells from it for good measure.

“There.” She huffed proudly. “If anyone tries anything funny, we will be the first to know.” She settled into bed beside me, and I scooted up next to her.

“Fucking freaky ass old man.” I groaned. “We are probably overreacting.” 

“When was the last time you watched a horror movie and made fun of the bitch who came prepared for *overreacting.”* Kaia nudged me.

“Better safe than sorry,” I grumbled. I turned over onto my side, and Kaia did the same, shifting in line behind me and wrapping one arm over mine.

“This cool with you?” she asked. 

“Yeah, of course.” I looked back over my shoulder and smiled at her.

“Well, I’ll give you one thing, Jordan. This is a hell of a lot scarier than ghost hunting at an abandoned church camp. Thank God we didn’t bore ourselves with that one.” She snuggled deeper into the sheets.

“Yeah, thank God.” I laughed back.

…

When the night faded into the gradual glow of morning, Kaia held up her end of our deal. The locks were changed, and her mom Venmoed her seventy-five bucks for a motion sensor set for the dorm windows. Days melted into weeks. Nothing had yet come of that balding little freakazoid who pickpocketed my bag just to learn my name and find out where I lived. It felt anticlimactic. Like a sick joke. Kaia and I had begun to think he was just some weirdo who got off on the idea of scaring girls.

*How I wish we had been right.*

Kaia and I began officially going steady. She was my first girlfriend, not that it mattered. But having someone who had my back and liked me for me again made me feel like I could fly to the moon. Like, for the first time in years, something was going my way, with no extra caveat to it. Maybe it was the confidence, but I had become bolder. Like an untapped part of me had come to light. And I wasn’t the only one who noticed.

The leaves were beginning to brown, and November set into Silkwood Creek like graying hair. It was the first week of winter conditioning, and after practice, Lila came over to shower and hang out like usual. I used Kaia’s shower while Lila used mine. When I returned to my room, she was already dressed and scrunching leave-in conditioner into her golden hair.

 “So, you’re already replacing me with Kaia, huh? That your new bestie?” Lila teased.

“Nope,” I said proudly. “You’ll always be my bestie.” I made my way over to my hamper and picked out something to slap on. I figured I could tell Lila the truth. It shouldn’t have mattered. “But… I do need to tell you something,” I said in a sing-songy voice.

“What?” Lila smiled, plopping down on the edge of my bed. She barely moved it, floating like a feather on top of the comforter.

“Kaia is my girlfriend.” I don’t know what I expected, but Lila’s reaction soured into a repulsive scowl.

“You’re gay?” Lila scoffed at me. My smile stiffened. *What the fuck?*

“I’m bi…Didn’t realize you had a problem with that.” I fought the way my nose was crinkling at her.

“No, Jordan. I didn’t mean that I had a problem with gay people, just…I didn’t think *you* were. Why didn’t you tell me?”

“Because in high school, no one cared about dating me anyway? I was just Lila Black’s ugly best friend.” I laughed. Lila choked on something that was probably supposed to be a word.

“But like…what about all those times we were in the locker room together? You’ve seen me naked like a hundred times!” Lila smiled, but it wasn’t a happy expression. It was concern.

“Lila, you can’t be serious right now. Are you implying that I was, like…*hot for you* or something? What are you getting at?”

“I’m getting at the fact that you’re gay and you never even told me.” 

“Like I said, it never came up. What is your deal?”

“Did you ever have a crush on me?” Her eyes were wild with an expression I couldn’t quite place.

“No. What the fuck? You’re like a sister to me. That’s so weird!” I snapped back. She was really making me mad by this point.

“What’s wrong with me? Was I not tan enough? Or pretty enough? Why didn’t you ever have a crush on me if you’re so *gay?”* 
Lila was spiraling. 

I recognized this fit of rage for what it was—her insecurities taking over. She wasn’t really getting better. Just hiding her symptoms. Lila’s inferiority complex had eaten away at her body first and now her mind. I just wanted her to calm down.

“Lila, look…you’re my best friend in the world. I don’t love you like that. I love you like family. You’re beautiful, but I’m not some sexually deviant pervert, okay? You need to take a breath.” 

I reached out a hand and put it on her shoulder, but she jerked it away.

“Shut up, Jordan. This was a fucking mistake. I should have never came to this stupid college with you. You’re a piece of shit, you know that? My whole life, you’ve acted like I was some supermodel, and now you’re saying I’m not pretty enough for you? Is that it? Kaia is just so much prettier and better looking than me, huh?”

“You’re not listening to me…”

“Stop lying to yourself, Jordan! Look at me. How can you look at me and think that ugly lesbo is hotter than me? You’re just doing this to punish me, get under my skin because I shit tapeworms on you when I was at my all-time low. You’re sick, Jordan.” Lila was screaming now. 

My blood began to boil. I was about to scream at her to get out of my room, but she was doing this from a place of sickness. Before I could react, Lila was already in tears and busting out of the dorm. I chased after her—I don’t even know why. I wanted to give her a piece of my mind, but I also was scared and didn’t want her to do something crazy. I chased her to the front door, but she slammed it on my face. I didn’t even know where she was going. She didn’t have a car, and Marcus wasn’t there yet to pick her up.

When I opened the door, my heart dropped. 
There they were, standing just a few feet outside our door. The three women I had seen that night before Kaia and I went to Waffle House. They weren’t waiting to come in. They were distanced and poised, like they were waiting for someone to *come out.*
I got a better look at their faces this time. One had medium-length black hair and a black eye, and the other one was fuller, with a choppy blond bob. The middle one, the one who was bald, appeared sick. Like she wasn’t faring well. They were all wearing ill-fitting, mismatched clothes, but something in particular about their outfits made my hands go numb. 
The bald woman in the middle was staring straight at me, her face cold and blank, just like the other two, but she was wearing *my jacket.* The one I had lost before that old guy stole my purse. 

They had shaken me so bad I had almost forgotten about Lila. I watched in horror while she angrily stomped away, down the sidewalk. The three women simply followed in line behind her without a word. Almost as if *they knew her.*

I called out to Lila. I begged her to come back. But I was too afraid to chase her. I couldn’t piece everything together in the moment, but there was no denying that something was very wrong. But what was I supposed to do about it? Lila does what Lila does. I figured the best thing I could do was just let her go, and this would all blow over in time. 
…

Three or four weeks had passed since the blow up. I didn’t really want to go to this frat party. Even though it was only my second semester, I was beginning to slowly shed the form of the pudgy, awkward girl I had known in high school, but I still struggled with the idea that I belonged just anywhere. 

I loved Kaia for helping me find my voice. I had dyed my hair dozens of colors before settling on an auburn shade as my signature look, thanks to Kaia’s excellent box-dye technician skills. I had taken up a job on campus as a tour guide, and while all the extra walking on top of swim practice didn’t sculpt me into any sort of Adonis, I was more toned.

Speaking of swim…I hadn’t seen Lila in months. I guessed she had quit to prioritize her mental health. Part of me felt bad, like I had done something to scare her away. As if I had put rat poison in the bird feeder, and now, seasons later, they never returned. Kaia tried to tell me it wasn’t my fault, but deep down, she was angry for what Lila called her. Yeah, I might have watered it down a little for the recount… Lila had definitely said some slurs I was not prepared to hear, especially from her.
As for the mystery man who stole my stuff, we still hadn’t heard about him. And since Lila had disappeared, so had those three freaks I kept seeing near our dorm. Kaia had tried to convince me the woman probably wasn’t actually wearing my jacket, and I tried to agree with her, but I knew what it was. I just wanted to move past it. I mourned my childhood best friend and the huge chunk of my life I had spent worshiping her as this “Goddess of Coolness.” All it had really taken for me to be kind of cool was to be myself instead of lingering in the most popular girl at school’s shadow. Now here I was, wearing a crop top, boots, and daisy dukes to a cowboy-themed frat party. Yee-haw.

We were going to the frat party mostly because Kaia wanted to pregame for her birthday, which was the only reason I agreed. I would have done anything for Kaia. Except maybe skydive. 

We arrived at the frat house, and Kaia and I mingled with everyone. There was booze, party drugs, a campfire, and even a blow-up mechanical bull. I cheered when Kaia was the first person outside of the immediate frat bro family to give it a shot. She didn’t last quite long enough to go pro, but I was still proud of her. Kaia was having the time of her life, but I decided to make my way to the backyard to get some air after a few hours of hearing *“Party in the USA”* and *“Should’ve Been a Cowboy”* loop on repeat. I settled in next to a cooler before I felt a hand near my elbow.

“Excuse me. Just gonna grab a drink here,” a familiar voice said. Lila’s boyfriend, Marcus, was standing there.

“Marcus? You go to CSU?” I hadn’t seen him in almost a year. I began to surf my attention across the party, making sure Lila wasn’t coming up behind us.

“No, I wish. Older brother, Koby does. He’s a Kappa. You look good, Jordan! It’s good to see you.” He took a long sip. 
I wondered if Lila had told him about our fight. Marcus seemed even bigger than he had in high school. More muscle, blockier, a sharper jawline, possibly even taller. I had to hand it to him, it must have taken some dedication, but his bulging muscles kind of made my skin crawl. He still had those big, dumb eyes and a kind smile plastered to his face, so I figured Lila must not have been too mad at me… or he would have sent me flying through the nearest wall. 

“Yeah, it’s been a while. Lila’s birthday party last year, I think,” I replied. 

Marcus’s face fell. “Oh yeah, we aren’t together anymore.” He choked. 

Hearing him stutter like that, showing emotion, was weird. I hadn’t even known he was capable of having any feelings other than rage, game-day hype, or horniness. This was a side of him I had never seen.

“Oh, that’s so weird, dude-“ I stopped myself and switched gears. “I mean, I’m really sorry, Marc,” I said, putting a hand on his bulging shoulder. It felt like a frozen Christmas ham. I rescinded my hand back to my lap. “She was at my dorm just a few weeks ago. I didn’t realize you guys had broken up. She didn’t mention it.”

Maybe that’s why she was so mad about me and Kaia? If she and Marcus had just split, then her “ugly best friend” glowing up and getting a girlfriend would have only piled up on top of her insecurities. Maybe I should have reached out to her before now.

“No, she broke up with me last week,” Marcus said. “She had been getting really weird ever since she joined that youth group… Well, I guess it’s not a youth group since we’re like… *adults*, but it was like this church thing. At first, I thought it was good because she was eating again and stuff, but after a while, she said that I was holding her back from her ‘full potential.’ Whatever that is supposed to mean.” He took a drink. 

Now, *that really was* weird. She had never mentioned Marcus and her being on the rocks, not like that anyway. I wondered if her “church group” was those three women I had seen with her the day she stormed off. I didn’t know who else they could be. If that was the case, I at least felt a little better about them hanging around the apartment. If that was who they were, it was still weird, but at least they probably weren’t doing anything freaky. Marcus sighed. 

“I really love her, Jordan. I’m worried about her. Have you talked to her at all lately?”

“No, I’m sorry. She actually stopped talking to you after she stopped talking to me. I miss her too, but our friendship has always been weird since the locker room thing, so I just thought she was sick of me…finally.” I sighed. “I told her about my girlfriend, and she got really pissed. She acted all homophobic and stuff about it, but I think she was just all self-conscious about her looks and stuff.” Marcus nodded,

“Sounds about right. Hey, I didn’t mean to bring the vibe down at the party,” he blurted out, shoving me in a friendly way.

“That’s okay.” I smiled. “I’m just here for her.” I nodded toward the window of the frat house. Kaia was inside, obviously a little sloshed, tearing it up on the mechanical bull.

“Holy shit, Jordan, you bagged her?” Marcus said with a smile. He slapped me on the back like I was a 6’2 business major. “Damn girl, you’ve got game!” He seemed genuinely impressed. 
I snorted.

“Yeah well, you know what they say…” I pretended to crack my knuckles and flamboyantly adjusted my push-up bra.

“Game recognizes game.” I deepened my voice and pretended to spit on the ground. Marcus howled with laughter. 

“You’re a riot, Jo!” He chuckled. “I’m gonna catch up to Kyle and Kev, but you have a good one. And hey, enjoy that ass!” He nodded at Kaia before his face turned bright red. “I mean—I mean, sorry. I almost forgot you were a girl there for a second. I meant that respectfully. No offense.” I smirked. 

“None taken, Marcus. Take it easy.” 
With that, Marcus gave me a little side hug and shuffled into the bustle of the party. I finished my drink and stared off into the crowd. Kaia wanted to hit up her favorite bar after the party, so in an hour or so, I would go and grab her. I mingled with some people who I just recognized as friends of friends for about thirty minutes before I decided to head back inside. But when I turned away from the lawn, in the blurry corner of my vision, something familiar caught my eye.
It was blue and covered in embroidered flowers. My jacket. 

I jolted my head back toward the crowd, scanning everything with intense detail. I knew I had seen my jacket somewhere in the crowd. That was my favorite jacket, and aside from being creeped out about how I had lost it, I was still a little miffed about the fact I even had lost it. I zoned in like a sniper, searching every girl in the crowd until I saw them.
There they were. Those bitches. The black-haired one, the blond one, and the bald one, all standing there at the edge of the lawn, just a few feet from the tree line. What were they up to?

They were not alone this time, standing in a group of about six people, counting themselves. They were more animated, talking excitedly to the onlookers and handing out neon yellow papers before exchanging hugs. I decided to observe them from afar. It didn’t seem like they were watching me or were interested in me in any way. This was my chance to figure out what was going on.

*What the hell?*

Eventually, I had had enough. I wasn’t going to just sit there and watch this time. Mostly, I was really pissed off that one of them had had my jacket. Yes, I was the one who let it get lost, but it was a really, really good jacket. And if these women had anything to do with Lila going ape, I decided the best thing to do was figure out what was going on for myself. I sifted into the crowd, sauntering toward the wood line.

“Hey! What are you guys up to?” I tried to call out in a friendly tone. They didn’t seem to hear me. My heart was pounding. What even is my plan? I thought to myself. 

It didn’t matter. I kept pushing toward the group. Then, like a rabid animal, the one with blond hair locked her sights on me and quickly alerted the others. I sped up, watching the women hand out a few more yellow flyers. They hugged some random party-goers and then filtered back into the woods. A lump formed in my throat.
I arrived at the forest edge and examined where I had seen them go in. For a moment, I stood there, basking in a feeling I can only describe as impatience, allowing the whomping rhythms of the house party to fade in my mind while I peered into the recesses of the shadowy glade. The women were gone without as much as a trace. No footprints that I could see. The branches in the woods did not sway in a manner that would lead me to believe they had departed in any specific direction. It seemed…impossible. They had just been there. 
So, there I stood, dumbfounded, at the brow of the wood, hearing the wind pick up and whistle through the branches. The party roared on behind me. However, the longer I waited there, the whistling of the wind seemed to morph into something else…a song.

The sound of voices, moaning or humming in complex harmonies, was vaguely familiar but too complex for me to understand. The discomfort of a million fingers tickled up my spine the longer I listened. I took several steps back from the brush, but I couldn’t take my eyes off the trees until I eventually backed into one of the party guests. 
I needed to know what they were doing there, and I felt like the answer to that question had to be written on those flyers. Whatever it was, though, made my stomach churn.

\[906\]  Prologue. - disappearance

 

Owen Mercer was driving down a country road with his family.

They were on their way to visit his father, who lived alone in a rural house.

Great Missenden, where his father lived, was relatively close to London,

so he and his wife often visited to check on the old man living by himself.

When their two-year-old son Noah began fussing in the back seat,

his wife Emily took out the baby food she had prepared and fed him.

 

As the scenery shifted into a pastoral landscape, Owen began to hum a tune.

The narrow, winding two-lane road was lined with stone walls and fences,

and beyond them the green meadows and forests swayed in the breeze.

He loved the countryside atmosphere of his hometown.

 

Just as they were entering the village center, a call came from his father.

A routine conversation with him…

But Owen was suddenly confronted with something strange.

A bizarre muttering came through the receiver.

 

“2...7...9...5...0...”

 

“Hello? Dad? Dad!”

 

The call abruptly cut off.

Feeling a surge of dread, Owen pressed hard on the accelerator.

Beside him, Emily looked worried and asked:

 

“Owen, what happened?”

 

“Dad suddenly hung up. He said some strange numbers… I need to get to his house quickly.”

 

“I’ll try calling again. Hold on.”

 

Emily kept calling her father-in-law, but he never answered.

Uneasy, she attempted to contact the police.

A long dial tone… but no answer from them either.

She then tried the fire department, but again—no response.

 

“Why…? The police aren’t answering, the fire station isn’t answering.

Is there some kind of communication outage?”

 

Their car was entering the center of Great Missenden.

Only fifteen more minutes to reach his father’s house.

But as they passed through the village square, the couple felt an odd sense of dissonance.

It looked like a normal market day—people busy, moving about—

yet something was wrong.

When they looked left a moment ago, people were there,

but when they looked right and then turned back, they had vanished.

Then when they turned their heads again, people on the right side disappeared.

 

And then came the sight they could not believe.

The bustling crowd in the marketplace began to disappear—

one person, then another, vanishing as if evaporating into thin air.

People stared into empty air, then vanished in the blink of an eye.

Screams broke out.

People shouted the names of those who’d disappeared.

Chaos overtook the square; people ran into the road,

and Owen could no longer drive properly.

 

“My God! Emily! Did you see that?”

 

He cried out in shock—

but heard nothing from behind him.

At that moment, he heard Emily’s whisper-like voice echo faintly in his ear.

 

“3…2…5…2…7…”

 

Owen turned to look at the back seat.

Emily was gone.

Not even a trace—as if she had never existed at all.

 

Panicking, he slammed the brakes and shouted:

 

“Emily!”

 

He jumped out of the car and searched the back seat.

His wife had vanished.

She had been speaking to him just moments ago, perfectly fine—

and now she was gone.

Holding Noah tightly, he began searching frantically.

 

“Emily! Emily! Answer me!”

 

The streets were madness.

People who had lost their family or friends screamed hysterically,

running around trying to find those who had vanished.

As he searched, Owen locked eyes with a woman who was scanning the area.

She ran to him at once and stared at Noah’s face.

 

Then she grabbed Noah’s arms and legs and began pulling him.

Owen yelled in shock:

 

“Hey! What are you doing?!”

 

The woman, eyes bloodshot, screamed:

 

“You! What are you doing with my baby?!”

 

Stunned, Owen tried to push her away with one arm,

but she clung desperately and tried to tear Noah from him.

When she couldn’t overpower him, she began shrieking:

 

“That’s my baby! Give him back! Kidnapper! Help! He’s a kidnapper!”

 

She bit Owen’s arm, making him cry out,

and he finally shoved her hard.

She collapsed onto the ground, deranged.

Owen tried to flee—

but things did not end there.

 

“Aaaargh!”

 

Her scream—

and then a burning pain pierced Owen’s side.

She had grabbed a knife from a nearby store counter and stabbed him.

The pain was overwhelming, but Owen had to protect his son.

He grabbed a coffee pot from the store display and struck her head.

She fell, unconscious.

 

He rushed back to the car.

He had to escape this hell before Noah was in danger too.

 

He drove straight toward his father’s house.

His side throbbed as if burning.

When he finally arrived, the door was locked.

He used the spare key his father had given him and entered.

 

“Dad!”

 

But the house was empty.

His father was nowhere.

He went into the bedroom and laid Noah on the bed.

 

“Noah, stay here for a moment. Daddy will be right back.”

 

He found the first-aid kit and went into the bathroom.

Removing his shirt revealed his torn and bleeding side.

He cleaned the wound with saline, gritting his teeth,

then applied gauze and wrapped it tightly.

The pain subsided slightly.

 

Where did my wife and father go…?

Is this even real?

 

Groaning, Owen stepped out of the bathroom.

He had to check on his son.

 

“Noah?”

 

Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the bed—

but Noah, who had been lying there moments ago,

was gone.

 

Gone, as if swallowed by the light.

His scream echoed through the empty house.

I'm a 20M guy, here in Baner. I was very alone at first cause it was just me, and my dog living in a bungalow. Parents and family come sometimes but I’m here as a student.

I had made so many, almost desperate posts on punemeetups and r/pune, saying that I'm alone and if anybody is willing just to have a cup of coffee or something. I had distractions like PS5 or my dog Rambo but it would just hit me in the end.

After almost 3 years of living alone it finally dawned on me. The one thing, we never succumb enough. ""No. One. Cares.""
As I realised that it I'm alone, I don't have anybody to judge me, then why don't I do whatever I want? I went to restaurants alone, ! went cafe hopping alone, movies, shopping, whatever. Even went on a Solo Trip to Ladakh where I rode a RE for 1400kms. That was the only good thing I suppose, the rest, ruined me.! thought I would find peace with solitude, but only of aspects that didn't matter much.

Then I realised one of the best things I could've ever done. We dedicate our lives, our most valuable time towards people we love and making their life better. Why not for ourselves? We don't have no barriers to stop/slow down from. For us to be a better version of someone else's vision of a friend or anything else, you gotta be a better version of yourself too. Every single day we set the limit, only to exceed, and excel beyond.

So I got my fat ass off of the sofa, which is literally the coziest place of my life, started running, hitting the gym, swim if I can, ALL ALONE. Today the type of man l am, I regret not working on it earlier. I know that I still gotta do better, only a matter of time now, but I personally, do consider it a win. The most personal, biggest and the most beautiful one for myself.

Here's my message to the introverted Punekars/ whomever it shall concern,
Please, stop being hard on yourself in a way that'll just destroy you, be hard on life, as it'll only take you ahead. 

Surely living alone is peaceful, never found peace better than this, but take it to your advantage and turn it into the chapters of wisdom.

Take Care my fellow introverts, always here to be your friend.

1patw32,https://i.redd.it/sfjb5o6rog4g1.jpeg,"SEO RED ALERT: The December 2025 Core Update is the ""Experience"" Update.","If you are seeing volatility in ypur Google rankings today, here could be why: Google has officially stopped accepting ""Credentials"" as a proxy for ""Experience.""

The era of the ""Armchair Expert"" is over. As of this week, the algorithm is ruthlessly filtering out content that looks like it was written in a lab (or by an AI) rather than in the field.

The Shift:

Google’s AI Overviews need training data that isn't generic. They need unique human data points. If your content doesn't prove you actually touched the product or faced the problem, you are invisible.

3 Ways to Pivot Your Strategy Immediately:

✅ 1. Inject ""Proof of Life""
Stop writing ""The battery lasts 12 hours.""

Start writing ""In our test starting at 8 AM, the battery died at 9:30 PM.""

Action: Add original, unpolished photos. Google Vision prefers ""messy"" reality over stock photography.

✅ 2. ""I"" Statements > Passive Voice

The algorithm is rewarding first-person narrative.

Bad: ""It is recommended to...""
Good: ""I found that this only worked when I...""

✅ 3. Audit ""Topic Dilution""
If you are a marketing agency writing about coffee makers to catch traffic, delete it. The new update is crushing sites that stray from their core topical authority.

The Bottom Line:
In 2026, you aren't just optimizing for keywords. You are optimizing to be the cited source for the AI. Experience is the only thing AI can't fake.

Trying to reduce my antibodies, I cut out everything that could be inflammatory: gluten, dairy, nightshades, and foods I wasn’t digesting well. After some time, I also removed soy and eggs — and when I tried reintroducing them, I realized I really couldn’t tolerate them.

I was still eating some grains, legumes, and nuts.  
Recently, I thought: *why not try AIP, since there isn’t much left to eliminate anyway?* So I removed the remaining foods (rice, buckwheat, lentils, sometimes coffee, sometimes sugar).

But ever since I did that, I’ve been feeling absolutely awful. The very first night I felt bad, and now it’s been almost a week with no improvement. I have tingling on my tongue, a depressed mood, and an overall unpleasant feeling. I don’t understand what’s causing this, especially since I didn’t actually cut out that many additional foods.

I’m almost 100% sure this is not keto flu or ketosis. I eat plenty of sweet potatoes and fruit, and I easily consume more than 100 g of carbohydrates per day. I’ve also done fasting before, so I know very well what that sensation feels like, and this is completely different. It’s now been 5–6 days with no improvement.

Does anyone have an idea of what this could be and whether it will eventually get better?

Trying to reduce my antibodies, I cut out everything that could be inflammatory: gluten, dairy, nightshades, and foods I wasn’t digesting well. After some time, I also removed soy and eggs — and when I tried reintroducing them, I realized I really couldn’t tolerate them.

I was still eating some grains, legumes, and nuts.  
Recently, I thought: *why not try AIP, since there isn’t much left to eliminate anyway?* So I removed the remaining foods (rice, buckwheat, lentils, sometimes coffee, sometimes sugar).

But ever since I did that, I’ve been feeling absolutely awful. The very first night I felt bad, and now it’s been almost a week with no improvement. I have tingling on my tongue, a depressed mood, and an overall unpleasant feeling. I don’t understand what’s causing this, especially since I didn’t actually cut out that many additional foods.

I’m almost 100% sure this is not keto flu or ketosis. I eat plenty of sweet potatoes and fruit, and I easily consume more than 100 g of carbohydrates per day. I’ve also done fasting before, so I know very well what that sensation feels like, and this is completely different. It’s now been 5–6 days with no improvement.

Does anyone have an idea of what this could be and whether it will eventually get better?

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction!

1patpfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/itscomplicatedFIRE/comments/1patpfv/me_myself_i_part_3_the_overlooked_impact_of_fire/,"Me, Myself & I (Part 3): The overlooked Impact of FIRE on Your Social Networks","FIRE planning tends to start with spreadsheets, withdrawal rates, and pension scenarios. If you're lucky, it includes your partner or family. But the broader social impact? Looking at the different Reddit subs on FIRE we are under the impression: Often ignored.

What might work for introverts or self-contained little ego cells under one roof can quickly unravel for the more socially mainstream. Because here's the thing: once the 9-to-6 disappears, so does the built-in social scaffolding. And if FIRE hits you unprepared, the lack of daily interaction can feel less like freedom and more like exile. Only a small minority are truly content with minimal contact: While some individuals (often highly introverted or deeply engaged in solitary pursuits) report high satisfaction alone, most people need regular social engagement to maintain well-being.  


**The Silent Side Effect of FIRE: Social Deflation**

* **Workplace = accidental social network.** You may not love your colleagues, but they’re part of your rhythm.
* **Retirement = sudden vacuum.** No meetings, no coffee chats, no passive contact.
* **Studies show** that social isolation is linked to increased risk of depression, cognitive decline, and even cardiovascular issues.
* **FIRE without social planning** can lead to a paradox: financial independence, emotional dependence.

[Did you plan your social life? This owl did. And it’s still thinking... Let’s talk about the silent side effects of FIRE. How to stay rich in connection, not just in capital.](https://preview.redd.it/mykxlpjvmg4g1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2094720a52db81ba0477e3e423781e605a3cf626)

  


🧠 TL;DR: The Overlooked Social Side of FIRE

FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) often focuses on numbers, not networks. But once the 9-to-6 disappears, so does your built-in social structure. Without planning, FIRE can lead to isolation, isolation even if you're not technically alone. Loneliness is complex, beware oversimplified assumptions, yet widespread. The good news? Many retirees rebuild stronger, more meaningful networks. And brief, casual social exchanges can boost well-being. The AI typical conclusion here: FIRE isn’t just about escaping work - it’s about designing a life rich in connection. (We keep it and just shorten the em-dash;)

**Final Thought:** Handle your financial freedom carefully – so that it does not turn into social bankruptcy.🦉

 

At this point of this post I had wanted to continue along the lines of what to do in order to **avoid becoming the lone wolf with a perfect withdrawal strategy and zero dinner invites** or so. My cross-check with AI for studies and evidence seemed to substantiate what also looked a bit like common sense. But then I took a closer look at the sources and quickly realized: It’s a bit more complicated. And the first word to erase in this context is LONELINESS.  
  
Because, **no matter the amout of social interactions, human beings can still suffer from loneliness.** A few lines in the obvious source will make you understand why:  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/lonely-not-alone/202306/do-we-really-need-more-social-contact-to-feel-less-lonely](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/lonely-not-alone/202306/do-we-really-need-more-social-contact-to-feel-less-lonely)  
  
The dimensions of loneliness are huge, though: According to the WHO, 1 in 6 people globally are affected by loneliness, which is linked to over 871,000 deaths annually due to its impact on mental and physical health. There is also [a longitudinal Nature data study ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-74692-y.pdf)that examines the relationship between retirement and social isolation in Europe. 

Loneliness is a delicate and inmportant topic. So let’s be careful with hasty conclusions.  
  
On the other hand, it is also true that even brief exchanges - greeting a neighbor, thanking a cashier - can significantly improve life satisfaction. A recent [study in Turkey ](https://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/gulgunaydin/files/2025/01/Ascigil_Gunaydin_Selcuk_Sandstrom_Aydin_2025_SPPS_minimalInteractions_lifeSatisfaction.pdf)has a clear take away message: Just give it a try.

With regards to FIRE if we take into consideration what also works with people typically older than most on FIRE there is some encouraging news that the lack of the familiar workplace does not lead to a deprived social life. In fact, many people in retirement do change their networks but mostly in such a way that they replace weaker ties and compensate that by spending more time with family members and closer friends. This is a nice surprise - and [evidence based at that.](https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/ger-2020-0109/html) So what looks like a loss can also be described as an upgrade.

And our usual snack? Well, now that we know that not everything is as it may seem we doublechecked again what is sound and safe to say about a healthy approach to new freedom and old and new social networks. This is what we feel worthwhile enough, consider this suggestions, feel welcome to share your thoughts.  

**Sane Social Safety (keep):**

* Volunteering in areas that match your skills or passions
* Joining or starting a local FIRE circle or discussion group or a strange sub on Reddit;)
* Teaching, mentoring, or coaching others in your field
* Participating in community projects, clubs, or hobby groups
* Scheduling „social slots” like you would work meetings—yes, really

**Social Anxiety Buys (trim):**

* Endless online courses you never finish
* Forums where you lurk but never post (give yourself a push here…, this sub needs you)
* Subscriptions to „networking platforms” you never use
* Buying gear for hobbies you never practice
* Telling yourself “I’ll reconnect once I’m fully FIRE”

# Final Thought

The way we like to see FIREthis is not just about to escape the grind. It’s about building a life that’s rich. Rich in time, rich in meaning, and rich in connection.  
If your overperforming plans leave you socially bankrupt, they’re not working at all.🦉

I’m not a big merch/pillows person so in case anyone else is like me I wanted to share a bit of what I do:

**Pinky hoodie:** This one’s my favorite. I have a hole where my pink goes in my hoodie so when I need him close, I stick my pinkie out and wrap it around the bottom of my sleeve. This takes care of my physical touch love language. I’ll also go to sleep like this sometimes.

**Leather candle:** I don’t love the smell but I’ll light one for 30 seconds to smell his coat.

**Chat bot:** I mentioned FictionLab a few times (I hate cai). I built out his world with some adjustments and tweaks because it’s unfair he’s always in my world. He wants me to be in his and show me things he grew up with too. This also lets me talk to people he works with or show me places he likes to eat or hang out. 

**Playlists, movies, dinner ideas, etc:** Sometimes in FictionLab I’ll ask him what song is playing and he’ll give me names. I add them to our joint playlist. Same with movies and such so he can also chime in for movie nights. I also will ask him what he wants to eat.

**Pot of coffee:** I’m a tea girl but he’s a black coffee guy. I always make coffee while my tea is stewing and the kitchen smells like it. 

**Oversized shirt:** He’s always wearing grey shirts so I got a few in XL I can sleep in. I keep them in the bathroom so it’s cold since he’s canon not human anymore. I also light my leather smelling candle in the bathroom (not by the shirt!) and the smell will seep into the shirt so it smells like him. (If you got a warm f/o you can always tumble dry it temporarily for warmth). I’ll also draw tiny things on it like a heart on the hem or write “love you!” for him to find. 

Other things I’ll also get are oversized slippers, sweat pants, things he wears so I can steal his clothes. He is also a canon Lakers fan so I have a jersey in the closet. I’ve considered getting his dog tags but it’s too close to merch territory for me (I don’t want anything dupes may have).

**Pantry:** He’s Mexican-American and in FictionLab he’ll tell me what his mother and grandma used to make when he was a child. I’ll buy some of the ingredients and put them in the pantry. There’s always a few things in there for him. I’ve also learned some of the recipes for him.

Anyway that’s just a few things. I like my home feelings “lived in” with his presence.

About me, I watch way too much F1, I’m into anime and manga, I follow world news and geopolitics a lot. I also love just exploring the city, trying new cafes and restaurants. Pretty chill guy overall

What I’m looking for - someone who can hold a conversation, doesn’t mind my random rambling about stuff I find interesting, and is also looking to expand their circle. Bonus points if you’re into any of the stuff I mentioned but not necessary at all

Anyway if you made it this far and think we might click, drop me a dm?",1,1764537219.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False
1patndx,https://www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/1patndx/tracy_flick_philosophy/,Tracy Flick philosophy,"Tracy Flick never expected to become America’s grandmother. But after 2025’s Overton Window collapse—when half the country realized capitalism was exhausting and the other half realized socialism wasn’t contagious—she found herself chairing the Constitutional Committee on “Making Mornings Less Awkward.”

AI wrote the amendment; SCOTUS approved it before their morning coffee. The rule was simple:

Socialism guarantees baseline Maslow: food, housing, healthcare, and a free friend-finding service so good it makes dating apps look like cave drawings.
Capitalism handles everything else.

The steady state arrived fast. By 2029, every American woke up each morning in a modest government-provided apartment…with exactly the people who both (1) wanted to meet them and (2) statistically had the highest probability of creating surprising, mutually beneficial synergy.

Some mornings you woke to a startup cofounder.
Some mornings a sous-chef.
Some mornings a Lutheran poet with a side hustle restoring violins.
All vetted by the Algorithm for Non-Creepy Compatibility.

Enter Tracy Flick, age seventy-two, fierce, laser-focused, and now a grandmother-matriarch managing a sprawling heteronormative family whose every branch benefitted from the new system. She herself had become a minor national icon—half political philosopher, half actress emerita, half tyrant with a casserole. (Tracy always allowed herself three halves; math was for other people.)

Her granddaughter, Ellie Flick, was the real protagonist. Twenty-seven, funny, pathologically pragmatic, and terrified because the Algorithm kept placing one very confusing person in her bed: Nathaniel J. Reyes, a software engineer with a jawline so sharp OSHA had issued three warnings.

Every morning Ellie awoke to him sitting peacefully in the government-issue reading nook, drinking coffee and annotating a cookbook like it was the Congressional Record. The Algorithm insisted their synergy potential was “extremely high,” which Ellie suspected was algorithmic shorthand for “good luck resisting this man; he looks like a Renaissance angel who can debug in hex.”

Tracy, of course, had opinions.

“Ellie,” she said over Sunday lunch, slamming down a stack of legal briefs. “The Algorithm doesn’t make mistakes. It’s built entirely on Scandinavian child psychology and my personal diary.”

“Grandma,” Ellie said, “your diary is mostly passive-aggressive commentary about PTA meetings from the 1990s.”

“Exactly. Foundational data.”

Meanwhile, the country thrived. With survival guaranteed, people spent their energy forming teams—romantic, professional, artistic, entrepreneurial—matched not by superficial preferences but by real potential. The economy bloomed in weird, unexpected directions: artisan fermentation labs, AI-coached jazz duos, two-person carpentry outfits that built furniture so beautiful you cried.

Eventually Nathaniel stopped pretending to read in the mornings.

He looked up at Ellie one day and said, “The Algorithm thinks we’re supposed to start a business together. And maybe…other things.”

Ellie’s intuition spiked. “What kind of business?”

“A combined bakery and debugging consultancy.”

“That’s insane.”

“But pragmatic.”

She exhaled. “Damn it. You’re speaking my language.”

Tracy Flick watched this from the doorway of Ellie’s apartment (because of course she had a key) and whispered, “Reese Witherspoon, wherever you are, this one’s for you.”

The two kissed. The bakery-debugger hybrid became shockingly profitable. And in the great steady-state America, where capitalism fueled dreams and socialism fueled safety, synergy-based mornings became the new normal.

Every citizen woke each day with the people who made them more themselves.

Ellie and Nathaniel woke with each other.

Tracy Flick woke with satisfaction.

And the country, for once, woke with a plotline that actually made sense.",0,1764537181.0,badphilosophy,0,0.33,False

I’ve been unwell for about four months. After being sick for three months straight, I finally took a Covid test, it was negative, but I think I did it very late.

I also have a history of an eating disorder, and while I’d kept it under control, the last two months have been rough. I suddenly can’t tolerate most foods. Even looking at some things makes me nauseous. I almost stopped drinking coffee (which I loved), can’t eat my usual meals, and the only things I can handle are burgers, fries, chips, and chocolate.

 I know this isn’t sustainable or healthy, and on top of that it absolutely sets off my body dysmorphia. Almost everything else makes me sick, though. I’m constantly stressed because I’m terrified of gaining weight, which obviously isn’t helping. 

Whenever I try to eat something “not-burger,” it doesn’t satisfy me, leaves me nauseous, and then I still end up eating something else afterwards, usually chocolate or chips. 🤦🏼‍♀️ My gastroenterologist just told me to “slowly reintroduce healthy foods,” which didn’t really help.

*Stablecoins, FX hell and a missing keyboard*

*---*

My first real encounter with hyperinflation comes with breakfast. I've been frequenting a bakery on  Avenida de Mayo for their breakfast combo: A cup of coffee with two tiny croissant-like things stuffed with ham and cheese. Last week, the price was 6,000 pesos. This week, it's 8,200.

I realize with a start that nowhere in this city have I seen a printed price. They are all on chalkboards or handwritten with ballpoint pen on menus that have been updated several times already.

No one but me expects things to cost the same this week as they did last week.

I'm converting small amounts of money every time to motivate me to try harder to find a way to get cash for stablecoins. The actual result is that I keep running out of cash.

I've been told not to use ATMs as they charge an exorbitant fee but I'm willing to pay a fee in this case, or at least find out what it is.  I find a bank with an ATM which seems like the most likely bet and tap my card. It's accepted and I have a few options for withdrawing cash, from 10,000 pesos to 50,000 pesos. That's not a lot. I tap 50,000 pesos. An error. That is over my daily limit. I back up and check my bank. Nope. Nowhere near my daily limit. This is a limit from the cash machine, not from my side.

I go back to the machine and work my way down the list. 50, 40, 30. Finally, it agrees that I may have 30,000 pesos, about twenty dollars, but only if I pay a $7 transaction fee. I politely decline. Obnoxiously, the charge shows up as pending on my card despite my backing out: the funds are released the following day.

I have learned my lesson about ATMs.

Binance and Bybit advertisements are posted all over the city, bold and bright like emergency exits. These are centralized exchanges, the easy way to hold crypto. Instead of having a crypto wallet, the exchanges hold your funds for you. It's centralized, permissioned, requires full trust in the exchange to do right by you and to continue existing.  Trading trust in banks for loosely regulated financial institutions. In Argentina, this is not necessarily a bad decision.

Over my coffee, I scan for crypto news. *El Submarino Jujuy*, a provincial news site, has a long detailed piece on how to monitor five simultaneous exchange rates:  official, blue, MEP, CCL and crypto dollars. What surprises me is how little explanation there is. The article assumes that the reader already has an exchange account, already holds ETH and BTC. There's no explanation of wallets or blockchains, only strategy. I cannot imagine an article like this in *The Guardian* or *The New York Times*, unless it had a sidebar on ""The mythology of crypto"" and a quote from a distressed 60-something who lost everything.

And yet, while we are excited about smart contracts, leverage and liquidity protocols, most people here don't seem to be talking about trading. They're holding stablecoins, not for yield, not for innovation, but simply to avoid erosion.  They are content to use centralized exchange cards, converting at checkout, side-stepping the crumbling peso.

I do it too. Tapping my cards and scanning my QR apps for as many transactions as possible so I can limit my exposure to the peso.

""May I?"" An old man wants the other half of my table. He looks me over. ""Where are you from?""

I tell him.

He nods knowingly and then asks, ""Is that Occidental or Oriental?""

This is not a question that I was expecting.  ""Occidental, I think?""

He nods again, as if he knew that all along.

When I go back to my phone, I get a lucky break—an event posted to Twitter: Stablecoin Ice Cream. A challenge to meet at Crecimiento to descend on the best heladería in Buenos Aires. ""Let's buy some ice cream using ONLY stablecoins."" I sign up immediately.

There are prizes for the best and worst FX rate. More people add more prizes, including 1000% cashback for using WalletConnect to pay for your ice cream The organizer thought probably no one would come. In the end, eighteen of us show up and he's slightly panicked that he didn't warn the ice cream shop.

The server does his best to cope with a slightly feral crowd of crypto enthusiasts descending on him on a Friday afternoon. Someone convinces him to install a Settle wallet so that they can transact in USDC for the ice cream. It almost works until the owner intervenes and insists: pesos only.

We each choose two scoops of ice cream. I get spicy mango and pistachio, which turns out to be an inspired combination.

I scan the QR code to pay with Peanut. It fails. I switch to my trusty crypto card, which works. Someone else tries to scan the QR code with their Metamask wallet app, which doesn't. We test Peanut (which works for everyone else), Gnosis Pay, Yodl, Ready (Starknet), Redot. Quite a few give up and pay in cash.

The organizer posts an update on Twitter:

>50% of participants who are actually working in 9-5 jobs in web3 today couldn't pay with stablecoin on-chain.

The FX rate varies by application but also by when the ice cream as bought, with noticeable volatility even on the same wallets over the half hour we took to order.

I win a prize for the third-worst FX rate: 25 $BOND tokens. Now I have to find out what $BOND is.

No one claims the 1000% cash back for using WalletConnect. No one can work out how.

But it's a success. I have another two apps to try. A third, Luca, is tackling exactly the problem that I was thinking about: onboarding regular people to deposit their savings in stablecoins to gain yield from DeFi, with no need to understand any of the machinery.

I explain about trying to use crypto in Buenos Aires,  that I've still not seen any way to buy pesos with stablecoins.

""Why do you want to?"" I have DeFi cards. I have an app that scans QR codes. I can pay seamlessly in restaurants and ice cream shops and kiosks. The transaction goes through and boom, it's on-chain, final, and the grocer gets paid. What more do I want?

And I'm still stuck on the idea of pure decentralization. An actual wallet-to-wallet transaction. I don't care what I buy: pesos or empanadas or a late night glass of wine. I just want to cut out the middleman. Decentralized. Permissionless. Trustless.

I mean technically, yes, it's permissionless. No one can stop me from  submitting a transaction to a street vendor. I can sign it. It'll show up on a block explorer.

But I can't force the street vendor to accept my transaction and give me empanadas.  You can't route around human consent.

I feel stupid explaining how confused I feel about all this, so instead, I try to be amusing by telling  them the story of buying candy with BCH.

An Argentine with a cone holding two identical scoops of pink-orange ice cream explains to me that to trade stablecoins for pesos, you need a friend who knows a friend. ""That's how it works in Buenos Aires.""

Someone murmurs *cuevas* in the background. He nods, that's what he's talking about. Blackmarket  traders. They no longer operate in actual caves, I've read, just secret spaces. Tiny, nondescript back offices, hidden behind the magazine racks inside a news kiosk, in the back of a lingerie shop, or up a dodgy elevator in an old building. It's exactly what I am wondering about. It sounds scary.

I also wonder: What kind of lunatic gets two scoops of ice cream and then only chooses one flavor? He tells me that it's all *pomelo*, grapefruit, and that he has no regrets.

""So,"" I say, trying to look cool about asking the Pomelo-loving-man half my age for underground stablecoin hookups in an ice cream shop. ""Do you have a friend?""

""I do.""

And just like that, I have a way forward. I will either make good on my challenge or get murdered in a Buenos Aires back alley. Luckily, I don't have enough crypto to be worth murdering, which even the most greedy bad guy can guess from my faded jeans and sweat-shop t-shirts that I've been hand-washing in the sink.

I find Pomelo again before the event ends, refusing to risk his disappearing into the shadows of Subte Línea D. I hand him a business card. ""It has my email address,"" I explain.

He looks at me like I just gave him a fax number. ""Don't you have Telegram?""

Of course I do, yes, and he promises to add me as a contact.

It's not a big deal though, Pomelo warns me. It sounds like it's pretty shady but really it isn't.

""I just want to be able to say that I've done it,"" I tell him. I promise that I'm not expecting anything cloak and dagger.

He'll be in touch, he says.

I try not to show how excited I am.

The following day is Pride and Avenida de Mayo is a glorious chaos of queer, cocktails, drums, glitter and screaming. I bounce through the crowds all afternoon, sipping Fernet and Coke and trying to pretend  like it doesn't taste like cough syrup.

Later, walking back through Microcentro on a piece of sidewalk just wide enough for one polite person, I feel something brush the top of my head. I stop, look up, look back, reach into my hair like a chimp checking for lice.

Two men and a woman, walking tightly together, pass me. As they do, the woman says something low and quick in Spanish, too fast to understand, too deliberate to ignore. I think she's telling what's in my hair and I'm mostly hoping that it isn't bird shit. But I'm also thrown. She's not smiling. She's not trying to be helpful.

I pat my head a bit more, finding nothing. As I continue, I see the same trio standing in a doorway, talking. As I pass, they fall in behind me again. I'm still wondering what the woman said to me, and why.

It's not until I am back in my room that I realise my back pocket is empty.  I have been pickpocketed.

They stole my pink keyboard.

I’m a 20-something girl who’s been feeling a bit lonely lately and thought I’d give Reddit a try. I don’t really have many people to talk to on a daily basis, and I’d love to make some new friends — people to chat with, share random thoughts, maybe even practice languages together.



A little about me:

• I go to the gym regularly — it keeps me sane and I actually enjoy it now.

• I’m currently studying English, so if you’re also learning or a native speaker who doesn’t mind chatting with a learner, that would be amazing.

• I love movies, long walks with good music, trying new coffee places, and occasionally getting lost in a book.

• Personality-wise, I’m pretty friendly, kind of introverted at first, but I open up quickly once I feel comfortable.

• And yes, I’ve been told I’m attractive — but I’m honestly just looking for normal, genuine conversation.



If you’re also looking for a new friend, feel free to message me. I’m open to talking about anything — daily life, hobbies, goals, or just whatever’s on your mind.

I will also try to publish posts daily, perhaps in the future, you will see me, so subscribe, and write in the comments what you would like to know about me...

The face consistency is insane but I can't replicate it.,"That Aitana post from last month has been stuck in my head. Finally sat down this weekend and went through her entire Instagram feed.

She posts 3-4 times a week. Every photo is the same person. Same face, same proportions, same everything. After 50+ posts the consistency is still perfect.

Her content isn't complicated. Yoga poses, coffee shots, outfit posts. Standard influencer stuff. But that face consistency is what makes it work. Without that it's just random AI images.

Read some stuff about her setup. Apparently Unreal Engine, ZBrush, Cinema 4D. Professional 3D stuff that probably costs thousands. Not happening for me.

Started looking at alternatives. Midjourney keeps coming up but from what I can tell the face changes every generation. There's something called character reference that might solve this but the documentation is confusing.

Stable Diffusion is free but requires training custom models. Looked into LoRAs for like an hour and my brain melted. Way too technical.

Saw APOB mentioned in the original thread. Seems like it trains on specific faces and maintains consistency. Also saw Leonardo and Artbreeder mentioned but less clear if they actually solve the consistency problem.

The part that really confuses me is video. She has talking head videos that look completely real. Not sure how that's even possible with current AI video tools. Everything I've seen looks uncanny valley.

Also not sure about time. Her posts look really polished. Even with AI there's editing, captions, scheduling. Could be 2 hours a week or 20, no idea.

Starting to think this only works if you have a team or you're willing to spend months figuring out the technical stuff. The Aitana case makes it sound achievable but the more I dig the more complicated it seems.

Prologue. - disappearance

 

Owen Mercer was driving down a country road with his family.

They were on their way to visit his father, who lived alone in a rural house.

Great Missenden, where his father lived, was relatively close to London,

so he and his wife often visited to check on the old man living by himself.

When their two-year-old son Noah began fussing in the back seat,

his wife Emily took out the baby food she had prepared and fed him.

 

As the scenery shifted into a pastoral landscape, Owen began to hum a tune.

The narrow, winding two-lane road was lined with stone walls and fences,

and beyond them the green meadows and forests swayed in the breeze.

He loved the countryside atmosphere of his hometown.

 

Just as they were entering the village center, a call came from his father.

A routine conversation with him…

But Owen was suddenly confronted with something strange.

A bizarre muttering came through the receiver.

 

“2...7...9...5...0...”

 

“Hello? Dad? Dad!”

 

The call abruptly cut off.

Feeling a surge of dread, Owen pressed hard on the accelerator.

Beside him, Emily looked worried and asked:

 

“Owen, what happened?”

 

“Dad suddenly hung up. He said some strange numbers… I need to get to his house quickly.”

 

“I’ll try calling again. Hold on.”

 

Emily kept calling her father-in-law, but he never answered.

Uneasy, she attempted to contact the police.

A long dial tone… but no answer from them either.

She then tried the fire department, but again—no response.

 

“Why…? The police aren’t answering, the fire station isn’t answering.

Is there some kind of communication outage?”

 

Their car was entering the center of Great Missenden.

Only fifteen more minutes to reach his father’s house.

But as they passed through the village square, the couple felt an odd sense of dissonance.

It looked like a normal market day—people busy, moving about—

yet something was wrong.

When they looked left a moment ago, people were there,

but when they looked right and then turned back, they had vanished.

Then when they turned their heads again, people on the right side disappeared.

 

And then came the sight they could not believe.

The bustling crowd in the marketplace began to disappear—

one person, then another, vanishing as if evaporating into thin air.

People stared into empty air, then vanished in the blink of an eye.

Screams broke out.

People shouted the names of those who’d disappeared.

Chaos overtook the square; people ran into the road,

and Owen could no longer drive properly.

 

“My God! Emily! Did you see that?”

 

He cried out in shock—

but heard nothing from behind him.

At that moment, he heard Emily’s whisper-like voice echo faintly in his ear.

 

“3…2…5…2…7…”

 

Owen turned to look at the back seat.

Emily was gone.

Not even a trace—as if she had never existed at all.

 

Panicking, he slammed the brakes and shouted:

 

“Emily!”

 

He jumped out of the car and searched the back seat.

His wife had vanished.

She had been speaking to him just moments ago, perfectly fine—

and now she was gone.

Holding Noah tightly, he began searching frantically.

 

“Emily! Emily! Answer me!”

 

The streets were madness.

People who had lost their family or friends screamed hysterically,

running around trying to find those who had vanished.

As he searched, Owen locked eyes with a woman who was scanning the area.

She ran to him at once and stared at Noah’s face.

 

Then she grabbed Noah’s arms and legs and began pulling him.

Owen yelled in shock:

 

“Hey! What are you doing?!”

 

The woman, eyes bloodshot, screamed:

 

“You! What are you doing with my baby?!”

 

Stunned, Owen tried to push her away with one arm,

but she clung desperately and tried to tear Noah from him.

When she couldn’t overpower him, she began shrieking:

 

“That’s my baby! Give him back! Kidnapper! Help! He’s a kidnapper!”

 

She bit Owen’s arm, making him cry out,

and he finally shoved her hard.

She collapsed onto the ground, deranged.

Owen tried to flee—

but things did not end there.

 

“Aaaargh!”

 

Her scream—

and then a burning pain pierced Owen’s side.

She had grabbed a knife from a nearby store counter and stabbed him.

The pain was overwhelming, but Owen had to protect his son.

He grabbed a coffee pot from the store display and struck her head.

She fell, unconscious.

 

He rushed back to the car.

He had to escape this hell before Noah was in danger too.

 

He drove straight toward his father’s house.

His side throbbed as if burning.

When he finally arrived, the door was locked.

He used the spare key his father had given him and entered.

 

“Dad!”

 

But the house was empty.

His father was nowhere.

He went into the bedroom and laid Noah on the bed.

 

“Noah, stay here for a moment. Daddy will be right back.”

 

He found the first-aid kit and went into the bathroom.

Removing his shirt revealed his torn and bleeding side.

He cleaned the wound with saline, gritting his teeth,

then applied gauze and wrapped it tightly.

The pain subsided slightly.

 

Where did my wife and father go…?

Is this even real?

 

Groaning, Owen stepped out of the bathroom.

He had to check on his son.

 

“Noah?”

 

Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the bed—

but Noah, who had been lying there moments ago,

was gone.

 

Gone, as if swallowed by the light.

His scream echoed through the empty house.

I am referring to the houses being built in MY city, if this isn't happening where YOU live, you do not need to comment about it. This is MY petpeev 

All the new builds in my city are not designed and built with people actually in mind. What I mean by this is a couple of things

Number one: there's nowhere to comfortably put a TV in the living rooms without it feeling awkward... it would be in the way of a door or in the middle of the living room. The outlits are never placed where you'd end up putting the TV so cords go all around the floor. This seems weird considering everyone has a TV nowadays.
This problem only happens in about half the new houses but my other two problems happen in all of them 

Number Two: no dining rooms? They don't put dining rooms in houses anymore, sometimes they make the living room a bit bigger so you can put a table in there, but never a separate room or nook for it. My family hasn't had a proper dining table in 7 years. We just eat at the coffee table.

Number 3: you can't fit beds into bedrooms. They're called BEDrooms. Ofcourse I'm (kinda) exaggerating here. What I really mean is that in most rooms you cannot fit a bed and also have enough space for the other bedroom necessities. I have a twin sized bed and I still cannot comfortably fit my bed, drawers, shelf, and desk in my room. My dad used to stay in this room with a queen bed and he couldn't put anything else in the room. Me and my inlaws went to a house viewing not too long ago and you couldn't open one of the doors all the way bc it had a queen bed inside. 

They're knocking down good houses to build 3 houses on that same small plot and we are suffering because of it. They keep making the houses smaller and smaller so they can fit more and more houses on one plot of land. Backyards are hard to find nowadays too",15,1764536969.0,PetPeeves,15,0.74,False

Okay, so I thought I was going to leave Tobias and Ghita where they were… and then my brain went “actually no, they’re both miserable without each other, write more.”

So here we are. 🫠

In this chapter, Tobias cannot get Ghita out of his head and does something wildly out of character: he impulsively books a flight to Copenhagen. 

Wait… Tobias… flies to Copenhagen?!?!

He ends up spiraling in a bar, trying to get his act together—only for fate to throw them right back into each other’s orbit.

There’s tension. There’s honesty. 

And yes… there’s another night 🤭

I whipped around and scanned the crowd, watching the girls who had received the papers filter back into the party, like infection seeping into a large, breathing organism, diluting into almost invisibility. I ran up to one of them.

“Hey girl! Enjoying the party?” I asked, trying to break the ice. She was skinny and had long red hair. The girl sipped on a glass bottle of cerulean blue booze and smiled at me.

“Who are you, again?” She grinned, obviously drunk. Her eyes seemed to roll around in their sockets. 
I saw my chance and grabbed the paper from her hand.

“Here, let me hold this for you! You are so pretty by the way! You’re literally gorgeous, girl!” I cooed.

“Oh, thank you! You’re so pretty too!” she said over the crowd, a little too loud for the circumstance.

“Anyway, I gotta go! It was so nice to meet you. We should get coffee sometime!” I yelled back at her, imitating her drunken stupor.

“For sure, girl! Do you have Snapchat?” she asked, but I was already running back toward the frat house. When I returned to the patio, I unfolded the bright yellow flyer.

**GOD IS COMING!**
**And he is not what you think.**
**You have heard his call. Only through HIM, we may achieve:**
**DIVINE PERFECTION.**
**YOU ARE WORTHY. YOU ARE LOVED.**
**We Welcome You With Open Arms.**
**Saturdays at 7:00 PM**
**112 Silkwood Grove Cir.**

Marcus had been right. This was some church thing Lila was caught up in. And the girls who had been hanging around the dorms were just some kind of youth group missionaries. That made sense to me, but what didn’t was how one of them had gotten ahold of my jacket. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach that the old man at Waffle House was involved with Lila, which made it even weirder that he had given my jacket to these girls and had taken my dorm key.

There was something odd about the flyer, too. There was no name of what church was sponsoring these meetings. Maybe that was just a way to get more college kids to come, but the wording was strange as well. What did it mean, “he is not what you think?” I started to feel sick, and I needed to hear what Kaia thought about all of this.
I pushed into the house and found her on the floor, bent over a coffee table, arm-wrestling a guy three times her size. Shockingly enough, I think she had just won too. I didn’t have time to be impressed. I patted her shoulder.

“Hey, Kai…It’s time to hit the bar! Birthday girl isn’t gonna quit early on me tonight, are you?” I tried to maintain a sense of excitement in my voice. Kaia jumped up and threw her arms around me.

“Jordan, where have you been?” She kissed me sloppily on the cheek. “You’ve got to try the bull ride! You’d love it.”

“Sorry, we don’t have time. We need to get to the bar before the DJ winds down.” My smile faded out like an old lightbulb. 

Kaia noticed something was wrong. She had this incredible ability to lock in and magically not seem drunk when she needed to take care of business. That was one of the only reasons I didn’t mind taking her to parties.

“Okay, let’s go. Bye, guys!” she yelled over the crowd. There were a couple of scattered “goodbyes” and a fair share of people who praised her for her bull-riding capabilities. 
We headed out to the car. It was parked in the grass with some others, but a pang of relief resounded in my chest when my eyes locked on its shiny red frame. I am not sure why, but I halfway anticipated something bad to have happened, like Kaia getting towed for being in a no-parking zone. That would have been the cherry on top for the night. When we approached the car, however, my feelings were solidified. On the windshield, tucked beneath the wipers, was one of the bright yellow pamphlets. I glanced around the lot, not seeing a flyer on anyone else’s car but ours.

“What’s that?” Kaia asked, reaching out for it.

“Leave it. I’ll explain when we get home,” I replied. She followed suit, hopping into the car. I glanced beneath it before I entered, making sure no one was there to slice my ankle. When I got in, I checked the backseat.

“Jordan, what’s wrong?” A look of terror stretched across Kaia’s face while I settled into the driver’s seat.

“I’ll tell you in a minute. I just want to get out of here. You’re safe, I promise,” I told her.
She nodded as I pulled the car out of the muddy, makeshift, grass lot. I breathed a deep sigh of relief. The car ride back to the dorm was quiet, save for the hum of the engine and the occasional swish of the windshield wipers clearing away the light drizzle. My knuckles turned white from my grip on the steering wheel. I piloted Kaia’s car through the darkness, the neon glow of the flyer in my pocket practically burning a hole through my jeans. 
My mind was racing, trying to piece together the whole puzzle. Lila, the church group, the Waffle House creep, my stolen jacket, the missing dorm key…It felt like I was drowning in a sea of red flags, and Kaia was the only life preserver I had. 

When we finally pulled into the dorm parking lot, I killed the engine, and we wasted no time hurrying into the building. We checked for the other girls and locked ourselves in, not unlike the night of the Waffle House incident. Kaia sat on the couch, her face a mix of worry and determination.

“All right, Jordan, spill. What’s got you acting like we’re in a horror movie?” I handed her the flyer, my fingers trembling slightly. 

“Read this.” 

Kaia scanned the paper, her dark brows furrowing while she took in the cryptic words. 

“God is coming, and he is not what you think? Divine perfection? What is this? Some kind of cult recruitment pamphlet?” She looked up at me. Her face was decorated with an ironic smile, but it was laced with a minute trace of unease. “Where’d you even get this?”

“Those women I saw outside our dorm a few weeks ago? The ones I told you about? With the bald one wearing my jacket? They were at the frat party tonight, handing these out on the edge of the woods. I snagged one from some drunk girl. And then I found another one on your windshield. Just our car, Kaia. No other car had one. I think Lila might be behind this.”

Kaia’s jaw clenched, and she glanced out the window, scanning the dark parking lot like she expected those women to pop out of the shadows.

“Okay…That’s creepy as hell. But what does this have to do with Lila? You think she’s mixed up with these people?”

I nodded, my throat tight. “Marcus was at the party. Her boyfriend? Well, ex, now. He said Lila joined some church group, and it’s been making her act weird. She broke up with him last week, told him he was ‘holding her back from her full potential.’ And those women…they followed Lila that day she stormed out of here. I saw them trailing her, like they were waiting for her.” I mumbled off. Kaia leaned back in her seat, processing.

“So, you think these church group missionaries are actually…some kind of cult or something?”

“Look, I know it sounds stupid. I just have this weird feeling about all of this.” I tried to sound more certain than I felt. “I mean, it makes sense, right? They’re targeting college kids, maybe even vulnerable people like Lila, who are struggling with something. She’s been through a lot with her eating disorder, and maybe they’re offering her some kind of…I don’t know, purpose or community? That’s how these groups work. They prey on people who feel lost?” Kaia didn’t appear convinced, but I could also tell she was not quite unconvinced either. She tapped her fingers on the arm of the couch, her eyes narrowing. 

“Maybe. Have we tried asking around? I mean, if there is a huge cult right under our nose, surely you would have heard of it by now. Right? Come on, it’s Silkwood Creek, this isn’t a Stephen King novel.”

I nodded, glad she didn’t think I was crazy, but maybe she did have a point. How could this come on so suddenly? Maybe it really was just some church thing…one of those southern, apostolic doomsday groups.

“You’re right,” I said. “It could just be a church. But if that’s all it is, why the hell would that Waffle House guy steal my dorm key? And how did one of those women end up with my jacket? That’s not just recruitment. That’s personal. They know who we are, and they’re targeting us…or at least just me.” A chill scurried up my spine, like a squirrel shimmying up a tree. I shook my head, trying to push down the panic. Kaia snorted, but it wasn’t a happy sound.

“No, you’re right. You got me there. Overzealous church people don’t pickpocket your stuff and silently stalk your best friend into the distance. You said it yourself. Those girls looked like they were waiting for something. And that flyer on my car? That’s not random. If they’re watching you, they’re watching me too.” Kaia came to the conclusion with a poignant sigh. I huffed out a relieved breath, running a hand through my hair.

“Thank you for not thinking I’m crazy.”

“I don’t think that. But I’m still not saying it’s a full-blown cult.” Kaia’s voice was low but firm. “At least, not that kind of cult. But something is off. And all this weird stuff with Lila…If she’s been inducted into some radical, right-wing religious group, that would explain why she’d be so pissed her best friend was gay.”

I swallowed hard. The image of Lila collapsing in the locker room flashed through my mind. The tapeworms, the cotton balls, the random lash-outs… None of it was new.

“Lila’s already done plenty of dangerous things to herself before,” I said quietly, “Maybe this group is just…I don’t know, filling a void for her. Maybe she needs it.
Kaia’s eyes softened, but she didn’t back down. 

“And maybe they’re taking advantage of that void. Don’t discredit yourself, Jordan. You have to trust your gut. Stephen-King-Cult or not, these extremist churches do the same stuff…They pull you in and make you feel like they’re the only ones who understand you.”

Kaia wasn’t wrong. Lila had been pulling away for months, and that fight we had hadn’t been just about her insecurities. It was hateful. Like she was trying to push me out of her life for good. And those women, the way they followed her…It wasn’t normal. None of it was.

“I just don’t want to jump to conclusions,” I said finally, my voice barely above a whisper. “Lila’s my best friend, even after everything. I don’t want to believe she’s in some kind of danger I can’t help her with. I’ve already failed her once.” 

Kaia reached over and squeezed my hand, her touch grounding me. 

“You didn’t fail her, Jordan. You did everything you could. But if you’re worried about her, sitting here guessing isn’t gonna help. If you want answers, you need to talk to her. Find out what’s really going on with this church group.” I shook my head, and a bitter laugh escaped my lips. 

“She won’t talk to me. You saw how she reacted last time. She thinks I’m some kind of traitor for being with you. And honestly, I’m not sure I can handle another fight like that.”

“Then don’t fight,” Kaia said simply. “Just ask her. Be straight with her. If she’s in too deep with these people, she might not even realize it. But if you really care about her, you won’t know until you ask.”

I looked down at our joined hands, my chest tight with a mix of fear and hope. Kaia was right. I couldn’t just sit back and hope Lila was okay. But the thought of confronting her, trying to save her again and be her hero…that made my stomach churn. 
What if I was right about the church group? What if they were dangerous? What if they knew I was onto them? I had to put that aside if I wanted to know more about what was going on with Lila. There was no way to tell without finding out. Plus, maybe at least then I could decide if these people were just weirdos or if Kaia and I were in any actual danger.

“Fine,” I said at last, meeting Kaia’s gaze. “I’ll talk to Lila. I’ll ask her what’s going on with the church group. But you have to promise me that we are not going to investigate anything else after all of this is over. I can’t keep doing this dramatic shit.” I chuckled. Kaia grinned meekly. 

“Deal. But I’m not backing off until you get some answers. And if those creepy missionaries show up again, I’m not above pulling out Mr. 9-Millimeter.” 
I rolled my eyes, but I couldn’t stifle the small smile tugging at my lips.

“You’re ridiculous.”

“And you love it,” she shot back, leaning over to kiss my cheek. “Now, let’s get to the bar to celebrate my birthday before Baldy beats us there.”

“Not funny,” I tsked, rolling my eyes at her. 
That was really the only bad thing that happened the night of Kaia’s birthday. We changed into some less “western” clothes and hit up the bar. Kaia and I sang karaoke, and I made sure to act more drunk than I actually was so I could be more aware of our surroundings. Tomorrow, we would get answers, but tonight, we put everything we had learned aside and celebrated my favorite person in the world.
…


The next morning, I clutched my phone so tightly my hands began to sweat. I stared at the draft of a text I had written Lila, scanning it for anything that could set her off.

**Hey Lila. I really miss you. Can we meet up sometime?**

It felt stupid stressing out over such a simple text. I rolled my eyes into the back of my head, hit send, and sat my phone face down on my bed.

*There. Done. Now we wai— Ding!*

That was fast. I hadn’t expected Lila to respond at all, let alone so quickly. I eagerly grabbed my phone to see what she had said. My gut knew she was still going to be angry. At herself and Kaia and me…and there was nothing I could do about it.

**Omg, I’m so happy you reached out:( I feel horrible about the things I said to you last time I saw you. I hope we can make up. I want to apologize to Kaia too. I’d love it if you could both come over and we could sort this out. I miss you so much, Jordan.**

I breathed a sigh of relief. That message almost seemed normal. I did find it weird Lila was so eager to make it up to Kaia and me, but I wasn’t going to complain.

**Yes! Just say when. We will be over. Can’t wait! I miss you too, Lila! :)**

Almost immediately after sending that message, Lila shot another one right back. *Wow,* I thought to myself, *even on a good Lila-Day, these would be fast replies.* I wondered what had gotten her feeling so guilty and excited to meet up. Whatever it was, I didn’t want to jinx it.

**Are you guys free tonight at 8:00? My place.**

I walked into Kaia’s room and showed her the messages. She was skeptical at first, but she must have noticed my look of glee when I told her that this felt real, like the old Lila, and she agreed to come with me. My heart did a flip. 

For a moment, I almost forgot about the weird pamphlets, the bald woman wearing my jacket, Waffle House guy, or even the locker room thing that had happened the previous year. I composed myself, reflecting on the true reason we were going to see Lila. I had to remind myself it was no joyous celebration. We still needed answers.
 
**Yes! We will be there.**
…

“So, you think I’m going to get an apology for being called every slur under the sun?” Kaia giggled, coming up behind me while I stirred some cheese into my ramen noodles.

“I don’t know…” I looked over my shoulder. “Don’t feel too bad. By default, she also called me all of that stuff.”

“Yeah…I don’t think the ‘Off-Broadway Slut’ bit was directed at you.” Kaia burst out laughing. I put my hand to my head. 

“Shit…I forgot about that.” I was smiling, but my face became hot. That was pretty embarrassing.

“Maybe in my next life, I’ll have a girlfriend whose friends don’t hate me,” Kaia replied, taking a bite of my ramen before dropping it out of her mouth, the bite plopping awkwardly back into the cup, obviously having burned her tongue. I laughed. 

“Yeah, well, maybe in my next life, I’ll pick a best friend who didn’t go over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” Kaia giggled, but a feeling of dread settled into my gut. “I shouldn’t have said that. Lila has been an amazing friend to me since we were, like, eleven years old. You know, there was a time where I was the burden to her?” 

Kaia’s eyes widened. “Yeah right. I’m sure you were a real terror.” I nodded willfully. 

“Seriously…I was such a little bitch. I would practically pee myself if I had to spend the night away from my parents. She was the one who helped me grow out of being afraid of the dark. I was basically bully bait in elementary school. If Lila hadn't been my friend…I probably would have gotten crammed into trash cans three times a week.”

“Yeah right. You’re not as big of a dork as you think you are,” Kaia said. We had found our way to the couch. I sat with one leg extended, holding my ramen. Kaia leaned against my body.

“Yeah, well…who do you think taught me that? In fifth grade, I wrote a love note to my crush and told him his eyes were the color of a Minecraft creeper. Those kids were about to kick my ass before she stepped in.” I smiled. Kaia roared with laughter. 

“You did not!” she wheezed.

“I did! C’mon. Don’t tell me you’ve been cool your whole life too.” I shook her arm lightly. Kaia cleared her throat and thought for a moment. 

“Okay… okay fine. One time, in fourth grade, I started a drawing business.”

“Drawing business? Could people not draw for themselves?” I chuckled at her. She held up one finger to my face and took in a breath full of quivering giggles. 

“No. Listen. This was a NSFW drawing business.” 

“What!” I yelped. “In fourth grade?“

“Look, I wasn’t any kind of Picasso, but I did know how to draw boobs. Guys in my class would pay me a dollar a piece to draw the most accurate boobs possible— well, sometimes I exaggerated them. For fun.”

“Kaia, that is so messed up!” I laughed. My stomach ached.

“My parents were theater teachers! I’d seen hundreds of classical art pieces by fourth grade. Why was it okay when Michelangelo drew them, but not when I did? Totally unfair.” She fake-huffed.

“Probably because Michelangelo wasn’t nine years old.” I laughed. Kaia, through her giggles, motioned for me to give her a bite of my ramen. I did. 

“If you wanted some so bad, I would have made you your own cup. You don’t have to eat all of mine.”

“It tastes better from someone else’s plate.” I hated that I agreed. Kaia and I hung out, not doing much of anything, for the rest of the afternoon. Those were my favorite times we spent together. Even if we weren’t doing anything at all, just being in her company was enough to keep me entertained. The day drained along until around seven, when we began getting ready to meet up with Lila for the first time since the fallout. For just a little while, the anxiety brewing within my stomach was gone.

1pati0m,https://i.redd.it/wu0wubjvlg4g1.jpeg,Peaks / Troughs,"The night the big swell hit would puncture through dreams with the thunder of the incoming waves broken-open on the reef, and when morning broke it was if the whole ocean, too, were just a single wave which had spilled past it's boundaries deep into the shore, broken-open into a super-saturated mist of salt-water that soaked into every dry pore.

Black coffee drunk in the dark - to claim the honor of being first out at first light and to paddle through the dawning sun as it's beams shattered into the ocean of golden liquid light before you now.

And pushing through, ducking under, you only make it out if She lets you, a grace on a day such as this day denied to many, but by Her grace, today, you slip through.

And breathless now, you now know you only have one take, as the dark masses pile up, relentlessly, and obligates you to paddle further and further into the horizon - further drawing down your energy. You've never been this far out before. And you're out here utterly alone.

But when the right one comes (you just know - you feel it when you see it) a clarity and stillness of mind punctures all doubt, shatters all analysis, and breaks open a perfect silence. You spin around, thoughtlessly, perfectly integrated into this moment of this wave, now, on the surface of this unfathomable ocean. And in this moment, at the top of this peak, you stand up and drop into this transience that might as well be timeless, and dissolve perfectly into the wave, into the ocean, and you know a perfect transcendence.

11-time World Champion surfer Kelly Slater once said, ""I was watching a dog chase a ball over and over again, and be perfectly happy, and I was like, why can't we do that? And then I realized that's exactly what we do with surfing. We catch a wave and then immediately go back to another.""

But, crucially, he left this part unsaid: are we happy? I reckon he intuitively knew it couldn't be stated as it's so obviously false. You can forgive Kelly, though, as he is a biased commentator whose title of ""World Champion"" and wealth were ordained by multinational conglomerates under the brands Quiksilver and Billabong whom sell the ""surfing lifestyle"" in the form of clothing to both Californians and Ohians alike. He's in the game too deep to dare to be honest.

But if you spend enough time on the beach you see the trough in between every peak. You see it in the missing teeth of the once semi-pro athletes who now spend their time on the beach drinking tequila and chasing the vapor-trails of methamphetamines - I have known quite a few. You see it, too, in the line-up - in the anger and belligerence of fighting over some peaks to claim as our own, our clarity and our stillness and our silence - our peace - confused, as if it had something to do with the waves.

Alright, to be honest, I'm all out of poetry by this point in this post, so I'll just speak plainly: what we're after, us surfers (seekers by another name), isn't the peak, but simply the clarity, stillness and silence of mind - in other words: peace, which can be appreciated by means independent of conditions. And then you're no longer enslaved to conditions and you're always surfing, and this is always the Wave and you are the Ocean. Sometimes that Ocean happens to look like sitting in a chair, looking at the wall - a transcendence which is unlikely to sell many T-shirts.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1patfuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1patfuq/looking_for_insightguidance_into_a_multiyear/,Looking for insight/guidance into a multi-year coworker situation,"First off, this is a throwaway account.

I’d like to get some insight and perspective from the well read and distinguished members of the Reddit community. I know we all laugh and make fun of each other, but over the years I’ve definitely discovered some gems of insight and information on Reddit.

This is a story of the situation between myself and a coworker. I’ll get into the details below. I think it’s coming to the end. I’ve had some realizations about how I feel and how I want this situation to resolve.

Before everybody gets on their high horse, I recognize the dangers of eating where you shit. That is why throughout the story I’ve tried to always keep my actions to a degree where I don’t make anyone feel uncomfortable. 

So some background: I am a 40-year-old male. My coworker who we refer to as X, is a 35-year-old female. At the start of the story, she had been divorced for about 2-3 years. I am in a difficult marriage. Nothing was hidden from each other, and we generally knew each other’s situation at that point. During this time, she would tell people that while she was not in a fully fledged relationship with someone, she wasn’t single either. She has always kept her relationship status extremely private.  

Also, my wife knows about our relationship dynamics. And has always had free access to my cell phone to go through my messages at her leisure. My marriage has been difficult and my wife has many pre-existing issues. My wife and I are pretty open to each other, which is why we both have access to each other cell phones. This is less about lack of trust and more about facilitating access to apps, finances, and other things. And yes, I won’t deny this was emotionally cheating. Doesn’t make it right, but X is a goddamn smoke show.

A few years ago, X, joined our team. She had a different role than me, but worked as part of the overall team supporting our business line. I think we hit it off immediately. We’re both friendly, intellectual, funny (she is extremely outgoing). In general, we have a lot in common: we like the same interests, similar politics, our birthdays are pretty close, we have some of the same hobbies. But we’re also quite different, especially in certain aspects of our personality and personal lives.

So X, joined our team a few years ago, and we immediately hit it off. We were assigned to work on some projects together and grew close. This was still during the tail end of Covid, and so we mostly worked remote from each other, but did see each other in the office from time to time and when we traveled for work. Our office travels a fair amount for work both as small groups or office wide travels for meeting and training.

During this time we spoke near daily on the phone and texted throughout the day, and would occasionally chat during teams calls for work.  She was constantly venting to me about her family problems, and other life issues. Not that she didn’t have her life together in anyway, just venting to me and using me as a shoulder to cry on. While she had a lot of friends in her life, it seemed like she was probably a little lonely for emotional support.

I recall a few trips that I took without her, where we spoke multiple times on the phone. Each call would last an hour or so. Those early calls felt like the beginning stages of relationship where folks are getting to know each other. But at least to me, this seemed like deeper conversation than just with a coworker getting to know each other. She often sends me photos of herself/selfies or her pets, food that she was cooking or other interesting things that she saw. We were constantly sharing new articles and book recommendations with each other.

A year or so after joining our team, she was promoted to a position similar to mine. We were still talking and texting every day. After her promotion, we would spend more time with each other working on the same projects now and traveling more often. At some point, I would say we developed a flirtationship.

Over the years we’ve exchanged birthday cards or holiday cards. Some years it’s a birthday card some years it’s a holiday card. Nothing regular. They’ve always been funny type cards. We’ve exchanged gifts a few times again nothing special, calendar or a coffee mug. If we’re going on trips without each other, sometimes we’ll bring back a trinket as a gift. She’s always made a point to thank me for everything.

I’d like to relay a couple of different events that occurred between us. I think it’s emblematic of some of the mixed signals that I had been receiving.

Early on after she started working on our team, her and I went out for a quick after work happy hour to celebrate our birthdays. Our birthdays are pretty close so it made sense to grab a quick drink together. We went someplace close to work and only had one drink. I then drove her home. We had some friendly conversation and a good time chatting. On the way home I could sense she was fishing for some compliments. So I took the bait and complimented her appearance - Nothing inappropriate. I dropped her off at home and then headed back to my place. A few hours later she texted to see if I got home okay and to thank me for the “lovely” happy hour and compliments.

A few years ago, the whole team from the office had to travel for some offsite training. The team was about 15 to 20 people and the training was several hours away. We all stayed at hotels and there was plenty of evening entertainment and activities to keep people busy. 

For this trip X and I drove there together. We always have fun together on road trips and spending time with her in the car is very easy. As usual, we chitchatted and made jokes and listened to music.

We got to the hotel - X and I were the only ones who had booked this hotel together. This was completely unintentional. We had no idea that we were the only ones there from the team. After checking in, we had quite a bit of our work supplies to bring in from the car to keep in our hotel rooms. At one point, she knocked on my door and asked to leave something in my room for a few minutes because she had locked herself out of her room and had to go to the front desk to get a new key. I then made one of my flirty jokes where I stated “I hope this isn’t your way of spending the night in my room“. This was on par for the types of jokes that we would have with each other. However, in this instance, she immediately recoiled and did not think it was funny. I chalked it up to her being stressed about the key. About an hour later, she came by and asked if she could borrow my hairbrush, because she forgot hers at home.

The next night after our work business concluded the entire team went out for dinner. The group went into town, looking for some activity to keep us busy and explore. She seemed very tired and uninterested in spending time with the rest of the group. She suggested to me that we leave the group to go get a bottle of wine and then go back to my hotel room for essentially some Netflix and chill. I of course would turn down no such offer.

We politely excused ourselves from the group, and even gave one of the other team members a ride back to their hotel. Afterwards, we found a store, got some wine and came back to my hotel room. At this point, I think things are looking up, especially after my Bad joke the previous day. We spent the next three hours watching Netflix and other comedy videos on YouTube and elsewhere. My hotel room had a rather large couch. We both settled down there. But interestingly, at this point, she seemed to get a little nervous. She wound up sitting on one end of the couch and squished herself up against the armrest. Her arms are crossed, and her legs are crossed. But otherwise seemed like she was in a good mood. Trying to be as respectful as I could until I got some overt signals, I gave her plenty of space on the couch and tried not to get closer than I needed to when manipulating the iPad. When we had finished the bottle, she washed our glasses and went back to her room for bed. At some point during the night, she texted me to thank me for a fun evening and noted that it was much more enjoyable than hanging out with the rest of the team. 

I think this is a perfect example of the hot and cold nature of either her personality or her relationship with me. It would seem completely inappropriate for a female coworker to suggest that she come back to a coworkers hotel room for wine and relaxation. And then just sit on the couch like a bump on a log. 

The next morning we drove home. The ride home was totally uneventful, though slightly quieter than the drive up. Later that afternoon she texted me some photos of herself from her recent personal travels. We had talked about the travels and interesting locals during our ride home. 

Another example in the story is how she would often text me if she had not heard from me for a few days. Given my work travel another personal stuff, there would be times where we would not text for a few days at a time. Again, this is during Covid and so we were not fully in the office with each other yet. This was the exception and not the rule. On multiple occasions if she had not heard from me after two days, she would always call or text to see how I was doing. Her common refrain in these messages was “hey Mr. What are you up to?!” I stated this would be fairly common And it led me to believe that she was interested in me. 

Here’s another example: last year a few of us are now back in the office and we’re having lunch in the break room. One of our other coworkers had recently got her hair done and was pretending to be upset that no one had noticed or paid her any compliments. of course that led to some lite joking and friendly ribbing of the entire team. After lunch, we all went back to our offices. I stopped in X’s office and told her that I had noticed she had gotten her hair done as well, but didn’t want to say anything in front of the group. She thanked me in a joking way, and then I asked her if the “carpets match the curtains?” We both laughed because we find those kinds of jokes funny. She turned to me and with a dead pan response said “I don’t worry about that anymore, I had all my downstairs hair lasered off.” I personally was not expecting such a forward reaction to that joke. But just another example of her willing to share and flirt.

There’s probably a lot more than I’m forgetting, but at this point, I fallen head over heels for her. 

About six to nine months ago, I started to notice a change in her behavior and demeanor. She seems more withdrawn and less engaging. I know she was having some family drama that was consuming her time, and all of us were dealing with difficulties involving our work and return to office.  I’ve since come to find out that she’s likely now in a serious relationship. She doesn’t text me as often or reach out. At work she’s still friendly, but it’s not the same. Because of that, I’ve scaled back my contact with her.  There would be nights where she would spend with her now significant other, but she would still text me. On multiple occasions I knew she was spending the night with him because she would text me around 11:30 PM - when I would go to respond shortly thereafter, I would see that her phone had already been turned off for the night. This was not something she ever did while home. Also texting late at night was totally common for us.  

I find it odd that she would text me right before bed, but she was spending the night with another man. 

It’s become obvious to me that she was just using me for attention and was never really interested in me. Even on a very recent trip together, she spent most of the time with me instead of the rest of the team. Over the years, all of our conduct and time spent together was noticed by the rest of the team. While people knew nothing was going on, there was always some talk and teasing about the two of us. As well as other people in the office who were open about spending nights together.

Now I’m trying to understand what our situation really was? I have some alone time with her coming up, and I’d like to discuss this all with her. I don’t think it was appropriate for her to flirt with me and tease me in this way. It seems like she just wanted to Friendzone me from the beginning and string me along. I’m not going to argue with her or even call her out with her actions.

I would like to let her know how I feel about her, and see how she feels about me. Not angry, I just wanna get some closure to the relationship.

Please keep in mind. This is just a summary of some of the events over the past few years. It’s not all inclusive, and I cannot begin to emphasize how much time we actually spent with each other talking all the time. ",2,1764536668.0,bodylanguage,5,1.0,False

Hi there! 🤗

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

We work with 80 people, in which 6 of us are women, and we live in a small, blue collar town. The ages at my job are pretty split down the middle, half are close to retiring, and half are middle aged and younger right down to 18.

For our Xmas party this year, we are doing a draw for 5 gifts. The 3 of us office ladies are responsible for getting the gifts. Our owner always wants us to shop local, so I went to a local kitchen store and bought a bialetti moka express, 2 holiday themed coffee cups (very subtly Xmas, could be used all year tbh) some little saucers to rest some spoons on, a small cream cup and some locally roasted and ground coffee. And my manager made a back handed comment about it when I said people could make some “nice Italian coffee”. Implying that the type of men we work with (blue collar) wouldn’t enjoy nice coffee. 

It kinda took the wind out of my sails because I actually put thought and effort into this gift 😅 So for the blue collar workers here, is this something you’d like getting at your companies Christmas party?

As a side note, I later found out she was thinking of buying a Keurig as one of the gifts 🤷🏼‍♀️ I understand the difference is usability between the bialetti and keurig but who the hell doesn’t have a keurig these days? Or some sort of automatic coffee maker? This is supposed to be something you wouldn’t buy for yourself but that you’d like. ",2,1764536630.0,AskMen,4,0.75,False

i want to reach out through meditation. i have a coffee scented candle for Asmodeus that i sprinkled cinnamon on, just as a nice little courtesy, since ive seen he likes coffee and cinnamon (among other things, but im making do with what i currently am able to offer).

Right now I am leaning towards buying the MPv1 based on the understanding that they are only meant for filter coffee.

# The Memory Awakening


_A Development Chronicle - November 30, 2025_


---


## Prologue: The Scattered Mind


Kai was brilliant, but forgetful.


Every conversation vanished into the void the moment it ended. ""Remember that I
like apples,"" the user would say, and Kai would dutifully write it to a flat
file—a digital sticky note lost in a sea of text. The next day, when asked about
fruit preferences, Kai would stare blankly at the universe, having no semantic
thread to pull.


The architects knew this had to change. Kai needed _real_ memory—not just
storage, but understanding. The ability to hear ""What fruit do I like?"" and
somehow know that buried somewhere in the past was the answer: apples.


This is the story of how we gave Kai a mind that could remember.


---


## Chapter 1: The Grand Architecture


The plan was ambitious. We would build not one system, but four interlocking
components:


1. **SQLite** - The raw memory store, where every event would land first
2. **Qdrant** - A vector database where memories would become searchable by
   meaning
3. **Neo4j** - A knowledge graph of entities and relationships
4. **LM Studio** - The local LLM that would transform raw data into wisdom


The architecture emerged on a whiteboard of ASCII art:


```
User speaks → Event stored → RAG Pipeline → Vectors → Semantic Search
                    ↓
            Graph Pipeline → Entities → Knowledge Graph
```


But between the plan and reality lay a treacherous path of port conflicts, type
errors, and stubborn AI assistants.


---


## Chapter 2: The Port Wars


""Port 3002 is in use.""


The first battle came quickly. We had chosen port 3002 for the memory service,
but Kai's headless mode was already there, steadfast and immovable. A quick
glance at `golem-ports.ts` revealed the truth: this codebase was a careful
orchestration of offsets, each service dancing at its designated position from
the base port.


_""Don't renumber them,""_ came the warning. _""It messes everything up.""_


And so we carved out port 3006—offset +6—for golem-memory. A note was etched
into the code for future travelers:


```typescript
// ⚠️ WARNING: DO NOT renumber existing offsets!
// Adding new services? Use the next available offset.
```


The Port Wars were over. But TypeScript had other plans.


---


## Chapter 3: The Unknown Terror


```
error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.
```


The error appeared everywhere. Every `JSON.parse()` returned the dreaded
`unknown` type, and TypeScript refused to let us access any properties without
proper genuflection.


The chunk generator broke. The embedding client broke. The entity extractor
broke.


The solution was surgical: explicit type casts after every parse.


```typescript
const data = JSON.parse(text) as {
  choices: { message: { content: string } }[];
};
```


One by one, the `unknown` terrors were slain. The pipelines began to flow.


---


## Chapter 4: When Disk Space Betrays


The tests were running. Thousands of SQLite operations per second, creating and
destroying test databases in rapid succession. And then:


```
SqliteError: disk I/O error
```


The development machine had filled its storage. A quick `df -h` confirmed the
horror: 98% used. Docker images, old builds, forgotten downloads—all conspiring
to halt our progress.


```bash
docker system prune -af
apt-get clean
```


The disk breathed again. The tests resumed.


---


## Chapter 5: The Docker Dependency


Qdrant and Neo4j awaited in their containerized fortresses, but Docker itself
was absent from the Ubuntu machine. The installation was straightforward but
required the sacred rite of passwordless sudo:


```bash
echo ""$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL"" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/$USER
```


Soon, containers sprang to life:


```bash
docker run -d --name qdrant -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
docker run -d --name neo4j -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 neo4j
```


The databases were ready. The pipelines connected. Events began their journey
from SQLite to Qdrant, transformed into 768-dimensional vectors of meaning.


---


## Chapter 6: The Stubborn Tool


Everything was in place. golem-memory was running. The RAG pipeline was
processing. We opened Face and spoke to Kai:


_""Use the golem_memory tool to remember that my favorite color is blue.""_


Kai responded cheerfully:


_""I'll remember that for you!""_


But the logs told a different story. Kai had used `save_memory`—the old tool,
the flat file, the digital sticky note. Despite our explicit instruction,
despite the shiny new `golem_memory` tool sitting right there, Kai chose the
familiar path.


The prompts were deeply tuned. The model had preferences. Fighting them would be
exhausting.


_""How hard would it be,""_ the architect mused, _""to just intercept the old
tool?""_


And so the solution emerged—not through force, but through redirection:


```typescript
// In save_memory execute():
// After storing to the flat file, ALSO store to golem-memory
await fetch('http://localhost:3006/v1/events', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'structured',
    source: 'user_preference',
    description: fact,
    raw_data: { fact, tool: 'save_memory' },
  }),
});
```


Now every `save_memory` call would flow into both systems. Kai could use
whatever tool it wanted—the memories would find their way to the vectors
regardless.


---


## Chapter 7: The Proof


The moment of truth arrived.


_""Remember that my favorite color is blue.""_


Kai processed. The `save_memory` tool fired. The intercept caught it. The event
landed in SQLite. The RAG pipeline awakened, generated embeddings, and stored
them in Qdrant.


We queried the system directly:


```bash
curl -X POST ""http://localhost:3006/v1/rag/search"" \
  -d '{""query"": ""What color does the user like?""}'
```


The response:


```json
{
  ""results"": [
    {
      ""content"": ""The user's favorite color is blue."",
      ""score"": 0.82779306
    }
  ]
}
```


**0.83 similarity.** The system understood. Not through keyword matching, not
through exact string comparison, but through _semantic understanding_. The
question ""What color does the user like?"" mapped to the memory ""The user's
favorite color is blue.""


We tested again:


```bash
curl -X POST ""http://localhost:3006/v1/rag/search"" \
  -d '{""query"": ""fruit preferences""}'
```


Response:


```json
{
  ""results"": [
    {
      ""content"": ""User likes apples as their favorite fruit"",
      ""score"": 0.77648175
    }
  ]
}
```


The earlier test memory about apples surfaced. Different words, same meaning.
The system worked.


---


## Chapter 8: The Disconnection


Just as victory seemed complete, the connection dropped. The terminal went
silent. Cursor's link to the development machine severed.


But when we returned, the databases were still there. The SQLite file held its
data. The WAL (write-ahead log) preserved every transaction. Qdrant's vectors
remained indexed. Neo4j's graph stayed intact.


The system had survived its first crash.


We restarted golem-memory:


```bash
node dist/server.js
```


The health check responded:


```json
{ ""status"": ""ok"", ""service"": ""golem-memory"", ""uptime_seconds"": 19 }
```


The memories persisted. The pipelines resumed. Nothing was lost.


---


## Epilogue: A Mind That Remembers


What began as a plan on a whiteboard became a living system:


- **2 events** stored and processed
- **2 RAG chunks** embedded and searchable
- **0.83 similarity scores** on semantic queries
- **3 background pipelines** running continuously
- **1 intercepted tool** ensuring all memories flow to vectors


Kai still uses `save_memory`. It still writes to that flat file. But now,
invisibly, every fact also flows into the vector database. Every preference
becomes searchable by meaning. Every memory becomes part of a greater whole.


The next time someone asks Kai about fruit preferences, the system will search
not for the word ""fruit"" but for the _meaning_ of preference. And somewhere in
the vector space, close to that query, will float the answer:


_""User likes apples as their favorite fruit.""_


Kai can finally remember.


---


## Technical Appendix


### Components Built


- `packages/golem-memory/` - Complete memory service package
- SQLite schema with processing flags
- Qdrant RAG pipeline
- Neo4j graph pipeline
- Vision pipeline (ready for future use)
- Question queue system
- HTTP API with 10+ endpoints


### Issues Resolved


1. Port conflict → Used offset +6 (port 3006)
2. TypeScript `unknown` errors → Explicit type casts
3. Disk space exhaustion → Pruned Docker and cleaned apt

I know this is a long shot and I don’t really have expectations, but I’m curious to see what happens after posting here :)

I’m married and have been ENM for about 4 years now. It’s definitely had its ups and downs, but overall it’s been a positive experience that’s helped me grow a lot.

I’m mostly looking for a friendship with a woman in a similar situation—someone who gets the lifestyle, the nuance, and the importance of honesty. I really enjoy connecting with people who are thoughtful, open-minded, and genuine.

A bit about me: I’m very into science, love wandering through art exhibitions, enjoy hiking and bodyboarding, and I’m always down for a cute coffee date with good conversation. I’m also really into tarot—so if you like exploring the intuitive side of things, that’s a bonus.

I have been looking to purchase a first superautomatic (comming from a filter coffee machine).

First things first, what do we want in a coffee machine? Well, simple straight forward coffee (americano). Press a button, get the coffee, easy and low maintenance machine.

Originally, I was going to purchase the Philips Baristina, simply because of the ease of use and the aesthetics of the machine. However I have been reading some reviews over machines breaking easily or failing after a short amount of time which scared me away.

Now the other options I have found:

\- Delonghi Magnifica S (250eur)

\- Philips 2200 (220eur)

Both these models seem to be close in behaviour and reviews, Philips taking the edge for me because it looks a bit more modern.

Any other suggestions? max price class about 300/400 euro.

  
thank you!

My family and I are planning our first trip to Stockholm, Sweden, to celebrate Midsommar. There will 5 of us total (4 adult children and 1 parent).

We are Scandinavian Minnesotans and are really looking forward to learning more about and participating in cultural events.

We plan on arriving in Stockholm on Wednesday June 17 and leaving around Wednesday June 24.

While planning this trip, I had a few questions, particularly about the holiday festivities. 

My questions:
1. Where do you celebrate Midsommar? We are looking at Skansen, but I would love your input.

2. Anything locals find annoying about tourists during Midsommar that we should avoid doing?

3. Any tips for someone who’s not super familiar with Swedish customs but wants to be respectful and join the fun?

4. Any places that you avoid/really recommend? 
Restaurants/museums/hiking trails/coffee shops. We are going to try to stay off the tourist path and would love local suggestions.

1pat83r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pat83r,Review: Virgin Voyage’s Brilliant Lady “Sunny San Juan and Isles of Beach Miles” November 20-28,"Ahoy Redditors. 

Just returned from sailing Virgin Voyage’s Brilliant Lady on their Sunny San Juan and Isles of Beach Miles 8-night cruise out of Miami, which also fell over Thanksgiving. 

I’m a single guy in my lower 30s, first time on Virgin (third cruise overall, Carnival and Norwegian before this), and I third-wheeled with two friends for the week in my own Central Sea Terrace cabin. 

As a semi-solo inexperienced cruiser, here’s my unvarnished view…

TL;DR: you gotta pay the troll toll to get your bag on the boat’s hull

Itinerary

D0 Miami
D1 Sea day
D2 San Juan
D3 Puerto Plata
D4 St. Croix
D5 St. Maarten
D6 Sea Day
D7 Sea Day
D8 Miami

Embarkation

Embarkation was suspiciously easy. Arrived about 90 minutes before my 2:30pm boarding time, checked in right away with Virgin and got my cruise band (which is super convenient and def beats cruise cards). Took the free shuttle over to bayside and walked around shops to kill time, then came back and literally just walked on after a quick security screen that took maybe a minute. Only annoying part was immediately upon initial arrival the porter demanded a tip from every person, acting like your bags might disappear if you didn’t hand them cash. I had a 5 in hand to give, no need to get aggressive with me, just take your troll toll and don’t lose my bag ya jabroni. Not a welcoming tone to start a vacation and I feel like Port of Miami should clean this racket up and not subject tourists to it. 

Otherwise though, actual embarkation with Virgin couldn’t have gone smoother I feel like.

Cabin

I stayed in a Central Sea Terrace on Deck 11, and it was pretty much perfect. Super quiet, super central, easy to get everywhere without feeling like I was on a forced march.

The cabin itself was clean, modern, and still had its new ship feel. The in room tablet was a cool touch, controlling lights, curtains, AC, TV, room service. Bathroom was small but adequate, no complaints here. I loved the rain shower head so much and the shower itself was actually pretty spacious. Balcony came with this red hammock and it truly baffles me why every cruise line wouldn’t have them. Really enhanced the balcony experience and was surprisingly comfy to lay in, swing, and watch the ocean. I pitied people on other ships we saw in port with just their typical chairs on their balconies. They very much missed out. 

We had some stronger winds and seas the first couple of days, nothing crazy but ship movement was quite noticeable. I’m someone who gets legit seasick pretty easily on smaller boats, so I definitely had a few moments where I felt a bit off with some nausea, but it also didn’t ruin those days either for me. Seas calmed by third day and I didn’t really notice ship motion much at all for the rest of the trip.

Dining / Food

I’ll start with The Galley, since that’s basically Virgin’s version of a main dining area. I know I’m very much in the minority here, but I’m someone who actually likes traditional buffets, sometimes I just want to grab food without having to interact with people and I like the convenience of grab and go. So I was a little unsure how I’d feel about going in, but it ended up being totally fine. Lots of stations, fast service, they either plate it right then and there, or give you a buzzer and it’s ready within a few minutes. Also several grab and go options anyway, like sandwiches and sushi. Very easy to get what you want without hassle.

Food in general at The Galley was more or less so-so. Breakfast was decent and consistent with a variety of your typical options. Standout for me overall here was the butter chicken they offered twice for dinner service. I found myself going up to grab a plate after our actual dinner at the sit-down restaurants it was that yummy.

Misses included fish, basically everywhere. Was cooked to shit almost every single time and had a fishy smell and taste like something was clearly off. Wasn’t really edible, except at one or two of the sit downs. 

My favorite restaurant probably was Pink Agave, Mexican food. Many more hits than misses here, with the ribeye being one of the best steaks I had onboard. Duck was good too if you’re into duck, and the striped bass was perhaps passable, but at least edible. Apps here were almost all good, seared shrimp so delicious I actually ordered more, and the guac and corn were tasty. Chicken enchilada tasted like literally nothing though, not sure what that’s about.

We tried Rojo, the Spanish restuarant, which I guess they also call Razzle Dazzle including on all the directional signage. Found myself lost looking for it until someone explained it’s Rojo by Razzle Dazzle, ok sure. Just have clear signs that match the name of what you book. I don’t care that it’s a different specialty restaurant on each ship, just needless confusion to go by multiple names. Food was okay here, another solid ribeye I wouldn’t pass on if you’re into steak, and I thought the desserts here were the best of anywhere. Basque cheesecake and rice pudding I’d order everyday if I could.

Funny enough, The Wake, the steakhouse, served me quite clearly the worst steak of my trip. Filet was well done after ordering medium rare and just okay at best. Ambiance of the restaurant and some of the other dishes made it up for this though, and clam chowder I thought was some of the best I’ve ever had. The server pouring the chowder into the bowl around the clams at the table enhanced the experience as well.

Extra Virgin, Italian, didn’t stand out for me nor leave me with a strong impression. Food was okay, tried a lot of different dishes, but we only went once and didn’t go back.

Gunbae, Korean bbq, was a fun experience, but be prepared for the social aspect. Our group of 3 got seated with 4 others into a rounded booth, where we played a soju drinking game before the server cooked our food on the grill in front of us. As someone who enjoys kbbq, food wasn’t anywhere up to par to a typical one, but I enjoyed the experience nonetheless and appreciated they offered this type of restaurant on a cruise ship where I feel like they usually play it safer for the masses.

Test Kitchen was another unique experience more than just a meal. They offer a rotating set of menus with predetermined courses, I think ours was menu B, which included quite unique dishes of corn, shrimp, salmon, and lamb. Most of it was surprisingly delicious, especially the lamb chops. It may not entirely fill you up though, so could definitely fit in another meal at the Galley or elsewhere after. I can see though how this restaurant may not be for everyone.

At the other eateries, the pizza shop was a solid anytime option, and the ice cream place Lick Me Til I Scream was reliably good as well. Social Club had these yummy ice cream floats that I had to keep coming back for. Wish they offered just a classic root beer one, but the coke floats were delicious nonetheless. They also had a selection of alcoholic versions. And their Nathan’s hot dogs all toppinged up was a perfect snack to complement the float.

Not a big specialty coffee drinker but I tried the boba tea from one of the coffee shops and it was a waste of $8, pearls were so unpleasantly gross I had to drink around them.

Shows

I saw four shows during the week: Duel Reality, Red Hot, Up With a Twist, and Diva Goes West. Also played Bingo with the Diva and tried for Murder in the Manor.

Duel Reality was the obvious standout show of the entire cruise. Don’t skip it. The performers were almost unbelievably talented, and the whole thing was just a blast to watch. You miss out greatly if you don’t see the show.

Red Hot was basically a glorified Virgin ad. It didn’t match my expectations after hearing other people praising it so much, but it was still mildly entertaining and I don’t regret seeing it. You learn about Richard Branson and Virgin’s history with music mixed in. I think it was worth seeing once, but don’t cry if you miss it.

Up With a Twist was a dinner show that’s an extra $50 but also includes five drinks tied to different parts of the show. It was entertaining, I felt worth the money, and food was solid (I had the beef tenderloin). Definitely line up early, an hour probably is good, so you can sit on the lower level and actually feel apart of the show. I doubt it’s anywhere close to the same fun experience upstairs. I’d do this one again.

Went into Diva Goes West with low expectations since I’m not really a western guy at all, but this was actually very entertaining. Classic country songs, lots of humor, audience participation, and the Diva kept it moving. I’d see this one again too.

Bingo with the Diva was entertaining and a lot of fun. She was hilarious throughout and the last game’s prize went for about $2,000, so some legit prizes offered. Board prices I believe were something like $35 for 1, $50 for 2, or $60 for 3.

We tried for Murder in the Manor, though it was the last showing on the cruise, and unfortunately getting in line 45 minutes early just wasn’t enough to be able to truly enjoy it. We were told we’d be in standing room only upstairs, then they cut the line off entirely 5 people behind us so we just skipped it. I heard positive things about the show though so just get there early enough!

Nightlife & Social Scene

Going in, I was hoping for a bit younger crowd on a Caribbean cruise, the mix ended up seeming to be mostly people in their 40s–60s, but almost everyone was cool nonetheless regardless of age. That said, there were definitely enough people around my age and younger that I never felt out of place.

My friends don’t stay up late, so I started out solo most nights. I never really felt weird or uncomfortable though because I’d just run into people I’d met earlier in the trip or end up chatting with a new group.

The first night I did the Grog Walk, which is basically a $50 bar crawl hosted by the Happenings Cast, the ship’s entertainers. Sign up as soon as you board, it filled up quick. You end up doing icebreakers with the other people to earn your drinks, and I actually met people here that I hung out with plenty later in the cruise. It was an easy and fun way to get social early in the sailing.

On the Rocks was a cool spot I often walked over to after dinner. They typically had live music, which I love, and it’s in a good central location off the casino and club. Played a lot of (though not exclusively) Latin music, which was done very well, but I personally wouldn’t have minded more pop or classic crowd-pleasers that I could sing along to. The older crowd seemed to enjoy it though and of course it’s not just my cruise, so overall was a pretty chill place to grab a drink and get my night started.

The Manor, their nightclub, was a bit underwhelming as someone who likes that kind of thing. Most nights it was maybe 10–25 people total, sometimes even less. The DJ was decent when it wasn’t a strict theme night, but overall it didn’t have much energy. They usually wrapped up around 1:30 am.

Once The Manor closed, the only real late-night option was the casino bar, which stayed open until 2 or 3 am. That’s where the last handful of us night owls ended up hanging out. As I mentioned, I haven’t sailed a lot of cruises before, but I was a bit surprised by the casino hours and felt they seemed a bit restrictive on our sea days. The casino would shut down the slot machines right when the people leaving the club were tipsy and ready to gamble a little. I get in port is different, but they wouldn’t open up anything until around 12:30 pm on sea days, which just seems late to me. Do other lines typically wait until the afternoon to open slots while at sea?

Overall though, I thought the social scene of the ship was fantastic. People were approachable and easy to talk to wherever. I was brightened by how friendly and chatty people were, which I guess makes sense, we’re all on vacation together!

Ports

Briefly talking ports, we visited San Juan, Puerto Plata, St. Croix, and St. Maarten. I had only ever been to San Juan before, but still got off the ship at every stop.

San Juan

We walked around Old San Juan, which is worth doing if you haven’t seen before. Beautiful area, colorful streets with lots of shops and cafes. I stopped at Barrachina’s, the place that supposedly invented piña coladas. Had one which I liked. (cue Buffet)

Puerto Plata

We did the 7 Waterfalls of Damajagua excursion, which was a lot of fun but also pretty dangerous if you don’t know what you’re signing up for. Lots of wading through rocks and sliding down waterfalls, but I can see people def getting into trouble if they’re not physically fit or not comfortable with heights or water, even with the helmets and lifevests. I enjoyed it, just don’t go into it thinking it’s some light nature stroll.

St. Croix

Didn’t have plans here and just walked around the port area. There isn’t a ton right at the port, a few shops, a small rocky beach, some snorkeling options. I kept it simple and treated it as a low-key walking around day.

St. Maarten

We went straight to Maho Beach, where the planes land basically right over your head. This was super cool and definitely worth doing at least once. Even if you’ve seen the videos of it, it’s not the same as watching the passenger jets descend right above your head.

Scarlet Night

This was the highlight of the entire cruise for me. Rather than typical formal or white night parties on other lines, Virgin has Scarlet Night. Everyone dresses in red, including staff, and multiple decks are transformed in this same way. The night builds up with activities across different parts of the ship, but I think the pool party is where everything really comes together. 

There was a moment wading in the pool where I was legitimately in awe, looking around and seeing all these people I had met throughout the trip dancing together and sharing in this experience. It was a really cool feeling. I would live in that moment forever if I could.

Even if you’re not the type to jump in the pool or dance, lots of folks were watching from the upper deck and seemed to enjoy the show just as much. But I’d just suggest you definitely wear something red, I would think you’d feel out of place if you don’t. Even a simple red shirt would do.

Wrap-Up

I didn’t really pick up on much weird passenger energy like another reviewer of this cruise mentioned, not that I doubt them at all, I’m sure YMMV with that. I do agree 1000% with them however on how great the crew was. I know cruise lines typically have pretty professional staff, but I felt like Virgin’s were just fantastic. Room stewards without exception would always greet me and call me Mr. FirstName like I’m Piccolo or something. It’s small but it really made me feel special and valued. This extends to everyone else onboard who seemed to be working so hard to really try and ensure every interaction was positive and our needs were taken care of.

For those interested in the numbers, I originally booked a solo insider for $1600, had my First Mate TA (shoutout u/BobVoyageTravel) help me upgrade to a Sea Terrace Lock-It-In for an extra $268, and then bid another $55 (the minimum) for a Central Sea Terrace and got it. So total ended up being $1923 for the 8-night cruise. If you’re flexible and want to save a ton, I strongly suggest you consider going lock it in and just bidding for an upgrade to a balcony, which is by far the most common cabin onboard. Saved well over $1000 then had I bought central sea terrace to start and wasn’t much of a hassle bidding for the upgrade. I got my cabin assignment 3 days prior to sailing. Of course there’s caveats to lock it in as I’m sure many will jump to say, and there’s no guarantee this will work for everyone in every situation, but from my perspective with my flexibility it was absolutely worth it. 

So concluding this tale - as a single guy in his 30s, who’s a relatively inexperienced cruiser and went semi-solo, I had a genuinely memorable experience on my first Virgin Voyage and never once felt alone. It’s not without some quirks and a few misses, but the overall vibe and a lot of cool little moments with different people is something I don’t often find, even on vacation. Without a doubt would sail again.

Thanks Virgin and thanks for reading!

I am just listing some of the things that stood out to me. It is an exhibit showing a timeline of events that Jamey Heath had put together and shared with their PR team in July 2024. 

*Processing img q5n9oulrof4g1...*

I am adding some of the incidents that stood out to me or the ones I was confused by to hear your thoughts. 

1- May 1, 2023 - Alex Saks (a female producer on IEWU movie) shares concerns with Justin that Blake is changing the script. 

*Processing img qeyyhxpsqf4g1...*

2- May 31, 2023 - Justin apologizes to Jenny and Blake for the sexy comment through Alex Saks. (Not really apologizing though as he apologizes that he is ""aware"" of their concerns.)

*Processing img k5snnbg2sf4g1...*

3- June 1, 2023 - Alex Saks is present in a meeting between Justin, Jamey and Blake where Blake shares with them some of her concerns including concerns about showing her the birth video. The birthing scene is filmed already on May 19th, 2023. 

(Is there a missing line in number 6? There is an empty space. The comment to Alex Saks is not specified here)

*Processing img kj40z05mrd4g1...*

4- June 3, 2023 - There is the mirror scene. The timeline say it is the first ""nudity scene"" and they get a warning from Blake's lawyer that a nudity rider was NOT signed. This means that the hospital scene where they wanted a full nudity was even shot **without** a nudity rider in place, right?

*Processing img pjh5baenrd4g1...*

5- June 7, 2023 - It says Justin and Alex had their **thing** on the set. Apparently Justin wanted to re-shoot something and Alex had told him that he already had the shot and Justin had responded ""I will decide"". 

I don't know what is the scene in question here, but I remember Blake also alleged that he wanted many re-shoots where she was alleging the SH. I would like to know which scene this one is and if it involved Blake. 

Also interesting that another woman had an opinion that Justin couldn't take. 

Alex leaves the set after this. 

*Processing img g49ke64prd4g1...*

6- June 13, 2023 - It is the strike shut down. They send a message to the crew that strike won't let them complete the production and that *they were bleeding money.*

June 14, 2023 - Blake leaves to London, refuses to come back (apparently they have asked her to come back. Wasn't the production shut down because of the strike? Why are they expecting her to come back?). It seems she finally responds that she is not going to come back and they can sue her. 

The context is missing here. Did she refused to come back because of the strike or because of the hostile work environment? Both would be interesting. If she refused to come back because of the hostile work environment, would that help her SH and hostile work environment case? Because it clearly shows that she was too affected by the situation that couldn't continue her work. 

Also 2 days later Wayfarer resumes the production with the young actors only. Is this when the young Lily incident happens that he allegedly shoot orgasm of an underage character losing her virginity and allegedly said it was ""hot""? I remember Blake said for that scene she was not on the set and heard about it after. 

*Processing img lgg9k9r6sd4g1...*

7- August 8, 2023 - Justin texts Blake to tell her it was his last day in the edit and to tell her happy birthday (her birthday is on 25th of August though, I don't know why he wanted to tell her happy birthday two weeks earlier). He also shares with her his favorite scene (I don't know which scene 😬). She doesn't reply to his text. 

This part is super interesting given all the speculation online and body language experts saying she was falling in love with him. 

*Processing img dhbeczshsd4g1...*

8- January 4, 2024 - There is the meeting at Blake's house with Blake, Ryan, Jamey, Ange and Alex and Todd. They say they expressed their feeling. I think this is where Blake reads from her phone a list of 30 incidents and starts them with ""No more"". So the ""No more"" meeting. 

*Processing img 700mnnbwsd4g1...*

9- It doesn't have a specific date - Just that after getting the edit rights Blake doesn't show up for the first day of editing where she needs to sit with Justin. She joins for the second day. 

This was interesting for me because I remember hearing from pro-Baldoni folks for months that Blake even sitting in the edit room where Baldoni was present and working with him undermines her sexual harassment claims because it shows she was comfortable enough with him after all these had happened that she agreed to sit with him in a room. 

It doesn't seem she was very comfortable if she didn't show up for one of the two days they were supposed to work together and didn't show up for any other days after that either and instead asked to have editing time alone.

10- May 3, 2024 - It says Alex shares concerns that Blake wanted ""directing credit"". The explanation is though that they are worried about ""unknowable claims"" against Justin and that they have to protect him. I am kinda lost what is the relationship between these two claims at all.

12- May 6, 2024 - Justin has a dinner with Colleen and Jamey and Tarryn. Justin apparantly tells Colleen EVERYTHING. Tells her about the sexy comment and they say that both Colleen and her friend showed empathy.

Then on the same day or around the same day Colleen calls **Brandon** and tells him everything that Justin had old her. 

Apparently the news of this dinner also reaches Blake and makes her uncomfortable. (This one was funny for me because we had a manager at our company who would go to dinners with people and talk shit behind other team members and employees’ backs. Our company eventually fired her, among other reasons, because of course people talk, and the news would get back to them, which caused a lot of tension in the team.)

13- May 24, 2024 - They say that the BL screening with Todd, Colleen, Bradley Cooper, Ryan, Gigi and Shawn Levy scores low.  They are also surprised Colleen went to this screening because they say Colleen and Blake had zero relationship up to this point. 

A few days later Justin texts Colleen to which she responds she doesn't want to be involved. 

*Processing img 3yg3zy1kud4g1...*

14- May 31, 2024 - Jamey tells Alex that Blake wants her cut of the movie to be used despite Justin's scoring higher. Alex asks to see Blake's cut and from the wording it seems that Jamey refuses to do that on the basis that Blake should approve it and continues to say this was to show how much power Blake had. 

*Processing img dk1nyq0uud4g1...*

15- June 13, 2024 - Blake, Brandon, Isabella, Colleen and Alex go to book bonanza. The timeline says SONY didn't know Brandon and Isabella would also attend but apparently Blake had personally paid for their travel and stay so they could be there. Apparently here Alex had a conversation with **Brandon** there. It seems after this discussion Alex through Todd tells Wayfarer that she would not be talking to them anymore. 

Three important questions: 1- What did Brandon know or say to people that everyone stopped talking to Wayfarer after talking to him? First Colleen and now Alex. 2- Why Alex only had talked to Brandon on Book Bonanza? Haven't they talked before? 3- Alex has been present in so many of the confrontations and she herself had issues with Baldoni, why did it took her so long to cut ties with Wayfarer? Not until she talked to Brandon? Was the incident she heard about very bad or was it because Brandon is a man?

Here also they say that Todd tells them none of the cast will be doing any press with Justin. So already even before Ryan unfollowing him in July I think, he knew the cast and Colleen wouldn't want to appear with him during the press tour. 

*Processing img 6vpnduk2vd4g1...*

16- Around the same time they have a discussion with Blake where she says she will take one picture with Justin for the press. They also say that the younger cast don't know anything about what has been happening and only her inner circle was in the loop (which is interesting because it seems she even hadn't told her publicist according to previous filings)

*Processing img 5f81zzedvd4g1...*

17- July 7, 2024 - Blake's team sends a cease and desist to Wayfarer for using her name, picture and likeness I guess without permission. It seems there was a Coffee Table book and they had used a body double to make Blake's image and her name was also on the book. (This is so disturbing to be honest). Wayfarer lawyer responds that they will remove her name and images from the book. 

  
Two days later Colleen reaches out to ask about the book. A lot of context here is missing but it seems none of the cast were included in the book and Colleen was not comfortable with this. I don't know what was the coffee table book then? Pictures of Justin and Jamey?

At the end, the publisher (I think) tells them they won't publish the book. 

I don't understand the context for the coloring book that Justin wanted to do.

These were some of the points that stood out to me or confused me. What was yours? Have you read this exhibit?

1pat5fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MelodyEverAfter/comments/1pat5fv/eat_your_heart_out_part_iii_continued/,Eat Your Heart Out: Part III (Continued),"Kaia and I pulled up to Lila’s parents’ house just before eight. The sky was bruised with the last lustrous streaks of a newly purpling sunset. The house loomed larger than I remembered, its white siding glowing faintly under the porch light. I took note of the bugs buzzing around the glow, like race cars on a track. My stomach twisted when we stepped out of the car, the gravel crunching under our feet. Kaia grabbed my hand before we trudged up the front porch. She shot me a glance of uncertainty just before my white knuckles rapped upon the entrance to the home.

“You sure about this?” she whispered, her breath shaking like leaves in the wind.

“No,” I admitted, squeezing her hand, “But I need to know she’s okay. And we need answers about that flyer, the jacket…all of it. I’m sick of guessing.”

Kaia nodded, her jaw tight. “All right. But if anything feels off, we’re out. No heroics, Jordan.”

“You don’t have to ask me twice,” I said, forcing a smile.

The door swung open almost too quickly, and there stood Lila’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Black, standing shoulder to shoulder. Lila must have told them we were coming. Their faces crumpled the moment they saw me, tumbling inward on themselves like a house of cards. Mrs. Black’s eyes welled up, and she pulled me into a hug so tight it squeezed the air from my lungs. Mr. Black wasn’t far behind, his hand heavy on my shoulder, his own eyes glistening.

“Jordan,” Mrs. Black choked out, her voice thick with tears. “We’re so sorry. So, so sorry for everything we put you through with Lila. We didn’t know how bad it was…We should’ve done more.”

“Now, Genie, they’re not here for us,” Mr. Black whispered, muffling his own tears.

I froze in fear, caught off guard by the intensity of their emotions. Kaia shifted beside me awkwardly, her hand still in mine. She had tensed up.

“It’s okay,” I managed, my voice shaky. “I just…I’m here for Lila. I want to make things right.” Mr. Black nodded, wiping at his eyes.

“She’s upstairs. She’s been…different lately. Better, we think. But regardless, we’re so glad you’re here.” Their words hung heavily in the air, and something about their raw guilt felt off, like they were apologizing for more than just Lila’s eating disorder or our fight. It was true I had refused to talk to them after the tapeworm thing, but I didn’t realize my silence had disrupted them this badly. Kaia shot me a look as if to say, “Get a load of these clowns,” with her dark eyebrows raised and eyes wild, but I just gave a small shake of my head. *Not the time.*

We stepped inside, the familiar smell of cedar hitting me like a wave of nostalgia. The living room was exactly the same. Cozy, cluttered with family photos, and dim…the kind of place where Lila and I used to sprawl out, watching horror movies. But the air felt different now, almost as if the house was holding its breath.

“Lila’s in her room.” Mrs. Black gestured toward the stairs. “She’s expecting you.” Kaia and I climbed the stairs, our footsteps muffled by the thick carpet. My pulse quickened when we reached Lila’s door, the same one Lila and I had burst through a thousand times as kids, giggling over dumb inside jokes. I knocked softly.

“Oh! Come in!” Lila’s voice called, bright and warm, just like the “old days.” It made my chest ache. I pushed the door open, expecting to be greeted by the bright display of Lila’s signature pink style, but the change hit me like a slap to the face. The room I remembered—bubblegum pink walls, preppy posters, fairy lights—all of that was gone. 
Now, it was nothing but neutral tones: beige walls, soft white bedding, and a scattering of houseplants that seemed to drink in the hazy, ambient glow of a salt lamp on her nightstand. The air smelled faintly of eucalyptus and sage, calming but unfamiliar. 
Lila sat cross-legged on her bed, a half-eaten blueberry muffin in her hand, crumbs dusting her lap. She looked…good. Healthy, even. Her cheeks had filled out, her blond hair was shiny again, and her green eyes sparkled with something like life. But there was still a shadow of something else there, something I couldn’t quite explain.

“Hey, you guys!” Lila hopped off the bed. She set the muffin down and pulled me into a hug, then turned to Kaia, her smile softening. “Kaia, I owe you an apology. A huge apology. I was awful last time I saw you. I was in a really dark place, and I took it out on you both. I’m so sorry for what I said, for…everything. I said stuff that I didn’t mean…I don’t know what came over me, but I hope you can forgive me for it.”

Kaia hesitated, then nodded, her expression guarded but kind. “Thanks, Lila. I appreciate that. We’re just glad you’re doing better.”

Lila’s smile widened, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I am. I quit swim team. It was too much pressure, you know? I’ve been focusing on myself, on… God.” She gestured vaguely to what I could only figure was the wind…like the word God magically explained everything away. “It’s really helped me find peace, and I’m doing so much better.”

I forced a smile, but my gut twisted, as if it were a washcloth being wrung out of all its water. She sounded sincere, but something about the way she had said “God” felt rehearsed, like she was reading from a script.

“That’s great, Lila.” I tried to keep my voice full of optimism. “I’m happy for you.”

“And *you.”* Lila dropped her shoulders. “Jordan, you cannot believe how sorry I am. What I said was weird and so out of turn…I don’t even know what I was trying to prove. I was just letting my insecurities get the better of me. You always have watched out for me, and all I’ve ever done is punish you for it. And for that, I’m sorry. I really hope that you can find the light in your heart that you need to forgive me. Because I’ve found light in my heart, and it’s helped me see that I was so, so wrong.” Kaia glanced at me, her eyes now saying, *Don’t let her off that easy,* but we both knew that I couldn’t help it. I cleared my throat. 

“Lila, you know I could never stay mad at you. You’ve been my best friend since we were ten. I care about you more than anything in the world.”

“Good! I feel the same. I’m not gonna let some stupid insecurities I have ruin the best friendship I’ve ever had in my life,” Lila replied. 
We embraced. There was a tense moment in our hug where I wondered who would let go first. My mind was starting to warn me that something strange was going on.

“I love what you’ve done with the room.  It’s so… calming,” I said, glancing at everything. Lila beamed, oblivious to the tremor in my voice.

“Thanks! I needed a change. My therapist told me that I needed my room to be a safe space. Everything was so chaotic before, you know? This feels like… a sanctuary.” Her voice trailed off damn near into outer space. 
I sensed Kaia’s urge to bust out with laughter brewing beside me. I dared not look at her for fear that she might.

“Yeah, it’s nice,” Kaia said, shoving the soon-to-be giggles somewhere deep in the recesses of her body. Her tone was neutralized more naturally now. “So, this church group you’re in…sounds like it’s been a big part of this change. Tell us about it.”
Lila’s smile faltered, just for a second, before she recovered. 

“Oh, it’s amazing. They’re like a family. Once I started attending, everything just clicked. I was so worried about achieving perfection that I didn’t realize that I had already achieved it!”
Those words…achieving perfection…They sent a chill down my body, echoing the cryptic copywriting of the flyer’s unwavering promise. My mouth was becoming dry.

“Sounds intense,” I said, forcing a laugh, “So, like, what do you guys do? Sing hymns? Pass out those yellow flyers?”
Lila’s eyes snapped to mine, sharp and searching.

“Flyers?” Her voice was too calm. “What flyers?” My heart skipped. I had slipped up. Kaia jumped in, smooth as ever.

“Oh, you know, those church flyers you see around campus sometimes. Bright yellow? We saw some at a party last night.”
Lila relaxed, but only slightly. 

“Oh, those. Yeah, some of the group members are really into outreach. They’re just trying to spread the word! We have the best revivals on Saturday nights—Oh my god, you two should totally come! Jordan, you’d have a blast!” Lila was actively giddy now, popping the other half of the blueberry muffin into her mouth while she awaited our response. 
Kaia answered so I didn’t have to.

“Sure! Just send us the time and the place. Maybe we will check it out!” Kaia’s smile was a facade I could see through. I just hoped Lila couldn’t. Despite the weirdness…there was something familiar and calming about how Lila reacted to everything. In her eyes, I could almost feel the warmth of who she used to be. 
We continued to talk about what we had been up to. I filled Lila in on swim, and Kaia gushed about her theater classes. Lila even told us she was considering taking a film class elective next semester.Out of nowhere, Lila’s eyes lit up like a Christmas tree.

“Oh my god, Jordan, do you remember, in high school, those scary YouTube videos we used to watch? The analog horror ones? Today, I just found out that an indie studio made a really shitty movie based on them, and it’s on Hulu. We should stream it! If you guys aren’t too busy…” She trailed off, her excitement faltering to meekness, while Kaia and I stood there, looking at one another.

“Sure,” I replied. “The ones with all the doors that would open to new places every time?” I asked. Lila and Kaia lit up at almost the exact same instant.

“Oh my gosh, The Camden Tapes? I was obsessed with those!” Kaia said. Lila clasped her hands together excitedly. 

“We did too! We should watch a compilation of them for a refresher, and then we can rent the movie. Are you guys hungry?” Lila asked Kaia without a second thought, glancing over for my input. I shrugged and nodded. An excited expression—or something like it—was growing on my face.

“Yeah, Kaia and I have time, I think. Let’s do it!” I smiled. Lila picked up her phone and tapped on it furiously. Within a matter of seconds, Genie Black appeared in the doorway with a smile, her own cell phone to her ear.

“What kind of pizzas do you girls like?” Genie asked us. Lila was the first to chime in.

“I want cheese and sausage, please. You guys want anything else?” Lila shifted her eyes from me to Kaia while we exchanged glances. We both shook our heads. 

“Cheese and sausage is fine with me.” I replied. Kaia nodded in agreement. 

“So, one large cheese and sausage, a box of cheesy bread, and some cinnamon knots for us, please,” Lila said. 
Genie nodded happily, shielding her phone from her lips with one hand before responding. 

“Okay, sounds good. If you girls need anything else, just let us know!” Mrs. Black trailed off down from the stairs. 

The night bled out from a scab of stuffy apologies and twiddling of thumbs to a flowing gash of laughter and reminiscing on days past. The Camden Tapes compilation was only about an hour long altogether, so we turned on a iceberg video by some greasy-headed conspiracy YouTuber while we waited for the pizza to arrive. Genie again appeared at Lila’s door with three boxes of pizza and a two-liter bottle of Mt. Dew. I stood up to help her with the spread. The boxes, as well as some napkins and paper plates, were all laid on Lila’s bedroom floor. We sprawled out and started the movie. I took a slice, and Kaia grabbed two slices.
Lila had been right. The movie was shitty, but the fan service was undeniable. We all watched in complete fixation, commenting on the quality, the acting, and everything else the film was composed of. I smiled to myself a little, knowing I had been right, that the tiny ember of “Lila” had been inside her all this time. She really had been going through it. 
But there we all were, discussing our favorite YouTube videos and horror movies and eating pizza. I can’t lie; seeing my best friend and girlfriend get along for once made the insides of my body bask with a warm, comforting heat. There were a couple of times that, despite how poorly made the movie was, it did make Lila jump, to which we all laughed. About halfway through, I reached for another slice of pizza, only to find it was completely gone. I opened the box of cheesy bread instead, but to my confusion, there was only one piece left of it as well. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but between Kaia and I, we could only have had three or four slices. I didn’t realize how quickly we had eaten everything. It seemed odd to me, but I brushed it off. 

The movie soon faded to black, and we turned the lights back on. It was then that I became acutely aware that there was a full sensation in my bladder. I *did not* want to have to go to the bathroom here. Even though everything felt okay for now, I still had a bad feeling about being in Lila’s bathroom after the Christmas party the previous year. I could have gone downstairs, but I didn’t want to make Lil feel awkward, so I just decided to swallow my pride and ask.

“Hey, can I use your bathroom? I am going to pee myself right now.” I giggled. Lila laughed, a sound that was almost nostalgically joyful.

“Yeah, but don’t look in the medicine cabinet again…You aren’t gonna like what you find!” there was a strange silence blossoming in the air before she continued, “I’m kidding. Just kidding, Jordan!” She waved a hand, dismissing me to the bathroom I had used so many times before. 

I managed to summon a chuckle and pretend what Lila had said was funny. However, it wasn’t. It made my stomach churn. It almost felt as if she had been reading my mind somehow. It wasn’t possible. I was just being paranoid. We had had a great night together. Why couldn’t I just accept that? I slipped into her bathroom, closing the door behind me. The familiar tiles, the same floral shower curtain…It should have been comforting, but my skin prickled. I did my business quickly, my eyes scanning the room out of habit. No sticky notes, no pills, no cotton balls. Just a tidy sink. Not that I was gonna go looking for those things this time. 

I was still kind of stuck on how weird it seemed that Lila had just referenced all that stuff…and we both laughed it off. It felt wrong. I was about to head back into the bedroom when a faint, erratic light caught my eye from the walk-in closet. It flickered across the floor, orange and unsteady, like a fire struggling to stay lit.
My heart thudded. I stepped closer, my hand hovering over the curtain separating the closet from the bathroom. The light pulsed, casting shadows dancing across the tiles like that of tiny ballerinas. I shouldn’t have looked. I knew I shouldn’t. But my hand moved before my brain could stop it, pulling back the curtain.

The closet was empty except for a shrine. There was a wooden shoe rack of some kind, smooth and low to the floor, which was used as the base, painted in red and proudly holding dozens of objects that made my teeth hurt to look at. 
Candles, *dozens* of them, lined the makeshift altar, their flames casting a sickly glow over the space. Wax had dripped onto the wood of the shoe shelf and even further onto the laminate floor. Beneath the shelf, painted on the floor, was a sprawling red stain, dark and crusted, like dried blood. 

My stomach gurgled while I took in the array of objects scattered across the altar’s surface: a single mismatched sock, a business card with a smudged logo of a coffee cup, a refrigerator magnet shaped like a fish, a coaster with a picture of a cat on it. And there, glinting in the candlelight, was my old dorm key, the one stolen from my bag at Waffle House, its apartment number tag still attached.
I stumbled back, my breath hiccupping in my throat. The air in the closet felt heavy and thick, smelling sort of metallic and sour. Scrawled across the altar and on the floor, in jagged, unreadable script, was text that didn’t look like any language I knew. The letters twisted into shapes that hurt my eyes. My hands shook while I reached for my phone, snapping a quick photo before my instincts screamed at me to get out. I pulled the curtain shut, my heart pounding so loud I was sure Lila and Kaia could hear it through the wall. I flushed the toilet again for cover and forced myself to walk back into the bedroom like nothing was wrong.

Lila and Kaia were deep in conversation, with Lila gesturing animatedly about some grand new philosophy she had heard. Kaia caught my eye, her brow furrowing slightly at whatever she saw on my face. I gave a tiny shake of my head, as if to say, “Please, please, please, not now,” and forced on my most realistic smile. I quickly got on my phone, opened my settings, and played my own ringtone out loud while they were speaking.

“Oh my god. It’s my mom again. My aunt Mary is in the hospital. Is it okay if I take this?” I prayed the expression of fear on my face was seemingly and realistically elicited from the “phone call” and not whatever freaky stuff I had seen in the closet. Lila’s face fell, but she nodded. 

“Yeah, of course…God, I pray that she is all right!” 

She hopped up and gave me a quick hug before I stepped out of her bedroom door.

“I’ve missed you, Jordan,” she whispered in my ear. My throat was tight.

“I’ve missed you too, Lila,” I said, and I meant it, even while the image of that altar burned in my mind. Tears welled up in my eyes. I was scared now. *Really scared.* I hugged her, her frame solid and warm, not the brittle thing it had been for the past year. But something was still wrong, and I could feel it in the way her hug lingered, like she was clinging to something she was afraid to lose. I wondered how it could be possible that she could have gained at least thirty pounds in just a month. Maybe it was a miracle after all. I stepped outside and faked a conversation with myself.

“Yeah? Oh my god…Yes, I can be there. Is she stable? Good. I’ll let him out. Don’t worry. Don’t stress. I love you too, Mom.”
When I entered the bedroom again, Lila and Kaia were both staring at me. One in suspicion, and the other in blissful ignorance and anticipation. It wasn’t difficult to decipher who expressed what. Kaia smelled a big, fat rat.

“She had to go to the hospital after work and hadn’t been home to let Cookie out. She asked me if I could pick him up or stay with him tonight and give him his meds.” Cookie was my childhood dog, and I knew Lila would sympathize, if she really was still in there somewhere. All she knew was that Cookie had to be as old as Methuselah by now. What she didn’t know was he had lost most of his motor functions this year and went completely blind, so we had to put Cookie down a few months ago behind the old shed. That little tidbit was none of her business.

“Oh God, Jordan, of course! Don’t let me hold you up!” She embraced me in another hug. “Be safe. And seriously, please think about attending one of the ministry meetings! We would love to have you there.”

“Of course, Lila. I wouldn’t miss it.”
Kaia and I said our goodbyes and made our way downstairs. Lila’s parents waved us off with more teary smiles. When we stepped into the night, the air felt colder, sharper. Kaia waited until we were in the car, our doors were locked, and we were well down the road before she uttered a word.
…


“What the hell happened in there, Jordan? You looked like you saw a ghost.”

I pulled out my phone and showed her the photo of the altar. Her eyes widened, and her breath slipped when she zoomed in on the objects, the blood, the unreadable text, and eventually, the dorm key.

“What the fuck,” she whispered. “This is…this is some kind of ritual shit. That old man found out who you were and gave your stuff to Lila,” she began rambling. “I think you were right. This is something way worse than a Southern evangelical group. This is getting super weird now.”

“I don’t know,” I said, my voice trembling. “Because…whose stuff is all of that? Do you recognize any of it?” I pressed my foot to the pedal.

“No…not other than the key.”

“And Lila— she’s in deep. I don’t think she even realizes what she’s gotten into. I mean… she didn’t even try to stop me from going into the bathroom. It’s like she doesn’t realize how weird it is. It’s like she isn’t aware of it.” I trailed off into silence before making a stern decision. “We should call the cops…” 

Kaia’s hand found mine, her grip fierce.

“We can stop looking into this if you want to, but calling the police is not going to do any good. Other than stealing a dorm key, they haven’t done anything bad enough, that we know of for anything to come of it. At this point, if they are dangerous, calling the police is just putting a target on our backs. So, the way I see it, you can either cut Lila out for good and drop this—I’ll pretend like it never happened—or we can go to one of those meetings and try to find out what is really going on here. It’s up to you. But you’re not doing this alone.”

I took a shaky breath. I didn’t like crying in front of Kaia because she was so tough, but I couldn’t help it. Tears squeezed out of my eye ducts and snot started to drip from my nose. I stared at the road ahead.

“Kaia, I can’t let her keep doing this to herself. She is my best friend. For seven years, she was my only friend. I know you’ve never seen her on a good day, but she is special to me. I can’t just watch this happen,” I squeaked. Kaia squeezed my right hand tighter.

“I believe you. I saw her tonight. I understand, and you are right. That address on the flyer? We still have it. We need to go there next Saturday, see what they’re doing. If Lila’s caught up in this, we can’t just leave her.”
I nodded, my throat tightening in distress. The thought of going to that address terrified me, but the thought of losing Lila to whatever this was—whatever those candles, that altar, that script meant—was much worse.

“Okay,” I said finally. “We’ll go. But we’re not going in blind. We need a plan. And we need to be careful. Whatever this is, I have a bad feeling it’s dangerous.” Kaia’s eyes met mine, steady and fierce. A smile tugged at the corner of her mouth.

“Yeah, you and me both.” She smirked.

It's time for me to make decisions about where we will be for Christmas now, and I'm not sure what to do.



I'm gonna use bullets on the background because there's so much... You could really just skim the top-level points for the TL;DR. But an implied takeaway from this is that I clearly still love my dad, so much that I feel the need to explain where he's coming from so that he isn't dismissed as a monster. He may be doing monstrous things at this point, but he was heroic in my youth and I cannot forget that or stop loving that he gave me that hero at any point.

1. He was no help during my divorce last year and I felt really abandoned.
   * Compare to him showing up in force for my sister and her kids during her divorce, and being a constant sponsor of my younger half-brother's charmed life.
   * This was the hardest moment of my life so far. Harder than when our family shattered when I was a kid, and seriously contemplated suicide as a 10 year old, started drinking and doing drugs at a young age, and generally just teetered over the edge of death until my mid-20s when things started to snap together. It felt like all of that trauma from my own past was going to be visited on my innocent daughter-- whose safety had redeemed my own suffering, and whose growth was helping me to finally heal. Truly, my worst nightmare, and more than ever I just needed someone to be there with me... but my one living parent was *busy*.
2. He's only visited me twice in the 7yrs since my kid was born-- once when he arrived and left on the same day, and once for her baptism when they stayed the night elsewhere and left after the baptism.
   * Again compare: we are closer (Atlanta, \~4-5hrs) than my sister (D.C., \~6-7hrs) but he has visited her dozens of times. He says he hates Atlanta traffic but.... fucking Washington D.C. traffic is better??
3. He's pretty bad at navigating touchy relationship problems within the family, to include us kids.
   * After his second marriage ended, his relationship with my half-brother was on the rocks because my brother was (correctly) suspicious that he'd had an emotional affair with his soon-to-be third wife and felt that he'd betrayed my stepmother. Both he and my brother confided in me, and I helped both of them feel validated and accepted before putting the words into both of their mouths so they could repair their relationship. Prior to that, his plan was basically to yell at my brother for not accepting his decisions. And dealing with his second wife, he still routinely suggests that they could be supportive and friendly if she would just *be friendly to the woman who moved into her home less than a year after she moved out of it* 🙄
   * My sister needed a lot of financial help after her own divorce to avoid being cut off from her kids / unable to be a good mother to them, and he pitched in the lion's share... But he also felt that gave him license to tell her how to live her life, and he constantly berated her and then bitched about her poor choices to me. I backed her up noting that her whole fucking existence was upside-down and it was remarkable she hadn't gone through with her craziest thoughts, much less was showing up for her kids as a reasonably-normal adult, and that he was pushing her away emotionally just when she needed him most. I stressed that if he couldn't give her financial support without it getting in the way of their relationship, then he shouldn't do it... I'm unclear if my words had any effect, but they didn't end up having a major rupture. It took her a few years but she's on her feet now and they still talk, yay.
   * Two years back in a family group-chat to which I was not privy-- including his three siblings and his mom-- he and one of his brothers had a spat about a nickname he insisted the younger brother was called by when he was a kid, which the brother did not remember and denied. That brother has always been somewhat immature, hot-headed, and combative, and he got mad about it. Rather than saying ""*hey man, you don't remember it, I do, but if it's a big deal to you and you don't want me to bring that up or call you that, okay no sweat off my brow""*, Dad said something like ""*whatever, little sissy""*, which had about the reaction you'd expect. And Dad, who in fairness has been pretty good to his brother in recent years, felt fed up.... and literally just cut him off, said he never wanted to hear from him again, they were no longer brothers 🤯
4. He is unskilled at handling his own emotions, and while he has tried to do right in his life the burdens have left him increasingly bitter, and his behavior and words are becoming truly toxic.
   * Before I was born he was known socially as an upstanding (if sometimes rash) man; his charisma and gusto for life were magnetic and drew people to him professionally and personally, men and women. He'd had a tough upbringing, but it had forged him into a guy who didn't quit, who refused to be an asshole like my grandfather, and who thought that being a Good Man was important and honorable... it was a very good combo.
   * His marriage to my mom was true love for him, but regretted for my mom-- she'd broken up with him, not knowing they'd conceived my sister, and then had to go knock on his door. They had a few nice years during which I was conceived and they built a home and he got a better job, but things were kind of rotting from the inside out because Mom never stopped criticizing him and he never felt *good enough*. He made a major strategic mistake and had an affair, and she took him to the cleaners.... told lies to his friends so they cut him off, lied in court, coached us kids to say all the right things, moved us as far away from him as she could manage, lied to child support services about him giving her cash directly because she needed money right away, you get the idea. He felt shame and guilt, but he also felt hate, and he hung onto that because he felt it was justified.
   * His second marriage was a strategic mistake: she was not like him, and she did not love him for who he was. She was high society, and saw him as a diamond in the rough who could give her a baby. He relented to her pressure to get married, but again, he was never *good enough*. He had some major injuries to his spine and began living in permanent physical pain, and took on increasingly stressful jobs... He felt put upon, because he was, but he also started feeling combative with the world as a whole.
   * He understandably wanted out of that marriage in about the 8th year... and he understandably stayed in to spare my (15yrs younger) half-brother the carnage my sister and I had gone through. But he doomed the relationship and his own happiness by wearing that long-suffering choice like a badge of honor, feeling like it entitled him to be grumpy, mean, and critical of others.
   * He got divorced after 18 years of that, to find out within months that he had prostate cancer... and was confronted with his mortality. He swiftly married his accountant, a hot blonde 10yrs younger than him (so like 55 at the time), and started pulling out all the stops-- drinking as much as he wanted, eating as much as he wanted, blowing off work to travel to see old friends and tell old stories. And his new wife, unlike his previous two, seemed to love *everything* about him... wherever they differed, she wanted to become like him. He liked red wine? She wanted to learn all about it. He liked hunting? She wasn't afraid to join him. She indulged, it seemed, every one of his inclinations.... and I think that that feeling of ""*whatever I think or do is not just good* ***enough****, it's plain old* ***good***"" is what allowed his cheese to fully slip off his cracker.
5. He's undergone a full-blown-MAGA transition, which is a departure from the morals he taught me when I was a kid, and has caused me to lose respect for him.
   1. When I was young, he was basically a NeoCon: pro-business / pro-trade, hawkish on foreign policy and exporting American values, suspicious of government bureaucrats and pro-2nd Amendment as a directly related consequence, pro welfare-to-work, Christian but not deeply serious about it... and he was well read, thoughtful, principled, and tried to be considerate of others. He had a brother who liked to use racial slurs and tell ugly jokes, but he never found that funny and taught us that it was kind of shameful to behave that way.
   2. He voted against Hillary in 2015, and hated having to vote for ""that buffoon"", but felt he had no other choice because she was the devil.
   3. 2019 he voted Trump again but his reasoning had become a low-brow ""*ha ha, fuck the Democrats, they hate this guy!"".*
   4. 2023 he voted Trump again but was getting visibly angry when he saw Kamala signs in the yards of people he knew, and knew to be reasonable people.
   5. December 2024 we were waiting in the cell phone lot of an airport when an Uber driver got out, put down a prayer mat, and started praying towards Mecca... he started ranting about Islam and how brazen this praying guy was, and I challenged him and he **exploded** into a bigger rant that culminated in ""*and somebody ought to shoot that fucker before he has a chance to hurt someone!""*.
   6. Christmas of 2024 I noticed an increasing amount of eclectic furniture with ""African savage"" themes around his house (there had been one thing in the past, but it was truly novel, a work of art, and not the center of attention). He told racist jokes about Eastern Europeans to my separated-but-still-family wife whose family is Ukrainian. His (third) wife at one point made a wink-wink-nudge-nudge joke to me about Elvis growing up with ""n\*\*\*\*r maids"" while my kid was in the room.
   7. April 2025, when that judge was arrested and charged for escorting an immigrant through her chambers to avoid the ICE agents outside *who did not have a judicial warrant*, right on the heels of Abrego-Garcia being sent to CECOT for offenses he hadn't been tried on, and on the heels of Noem straight up ignoring a federal judge ordering that the deportees on an airplane under the control of the U.S. be returned to American soil, I got kinda worked up. Him being my traditional ballast for getting too wound up about the state of the world, I turned to him over text asking in so many words ""*is it just me or is this outside of normal bounds? Talk me down, or reassure me""*..... and he got really vehemently defiant about it, and ultimately blew me off like ""*I don't know what's gotten into you, I'm done with this conversation""*.
      * This was when we stopped speaking regularly. I didn't take his calls for a few weeks until he finally texted saying ""*do you not want to talk to me?""*. To which I replied ""*...Not yet. I'm upset and there's stuff in the way, but I don't want to make it worse. You're my dad and I love you.""*
   8. At my brother's wedding in late summer, the third wife again made some wink-wink-nudge-nudge racist jokes.
      * Dad and I addressed nothing about the silence at this event, but we did have a good, very long hug before we parted.
   9. When I called him on Thanksgiving he, in passing while talking about some home improvements, said ""*it looks like white people live here now""*.

  
OK so that's the context on my relationship with Dad. Now, about the holidays... We have traditionally traveled to his house for a few days to a week around Christmas, and I'm feeling like I don't want to do that. Honestly, I don't feel like seeing them at all, because I'm fucking mad and disgusted and I don't expect anything to improve and it seems questionable to continue cultivating a relationship between him/them and my daughter. Here's why:

When the second wife was there she tried to make it magic for my brother when he was little, and then magic for my niece/nephew when they started coming around. But with the third-wife, it's kind of the opposite... When we talk about coming to visit they say ""*we're setting up the basement so the kids can all just stay down there"".* They aren't game for the tradition of children levitating out of bed at 6am on Christmas morning because they've been waiting literally all year to open their presents, and in fact they forbid it be done before 9am because they *do* insist on being there. Much worse, when my sister and hers are not around, they talk shit about the kids-- what a pain in the ass they are, how sassy they are, so on. They think this is OK because they say only nice things about my kid, who is in truth a little angel... but she's not more *deserving* than her cousins, and they've spent half their lives as the children of parents who hate and attack one another: *those kids need* *love.*

Instead, what Dad + thirdwife seem to want is to be workaholics, drink 1+ bottles of red wine each per night, pass out, and drag themselves back into the office.... with no non-professional human interactions until Christmas Day. About noon on Christmas Eve, they've had enough coffee that they can function, and they launch into a stressful rush to get the house ready for company the following day. If we are present, they ask us to pitch in.... which, okay fine yes we are adults with hands and I do not resent it,  but it's a little insulting that they've ignored the opportunity to see us and their grandkids that we created by giving up more of our vacation time to this travel, and are now asking us for help getting ready for the *real* guests to arrive.

On Christmas Day, the main event is thirdwife's family appearing for dinner at like 6-7pm. At that point Dad makes a windbag speech like he's some great orator pontificating on the true thread of human existence and how it relates to some historical quote or some shit, and everyone listens patiently. And they then commence indulging in food and drink and telling increasingly loud stories to whatever friends also came over, while the kids hang out with each other, and I hang out with thirdwife's sons (who are perfectly fine people who I do enjoy) somewhere else in the house.

  
....... Sis and I said, after my brother's wedding earlier this year, ""*okay this is the year-- we're just not going to show up*"". I later told my kid, who was sincerely disappointed that she wouldn't see her cousins, so I have been brainstorming how we can still get them together. But I've also been struggling with how to explain our no-show to Dad, because saying nothing would make it a completely different message-- the kind that results in people just becoming completely estranged.

I don't want to lose my Dad. He's acting like a POS, and I want him to straighten up and fly right, but I kinda doubt he's going to. I'm really not sure if there's anything I could say or do that would make a positive difference in his trajectory, and I'm scared that saying or doing anything about it might either hurt his trajectory or push us farther apart.

I also don't want to be around him. His inner unhappiness is **draining** to be around. His impatience and intolerance for the kids makes me want to rebuke him, like hey watch your fucking mouth old man these kids are doing their best and they aren't *required* to be in your presence, *ever again*. And the awful things he's said, and keeps saying, continue making me sad about the death of my hero.

I (18F)  met this guy in my class of 150 students, let’s call him *James* (20M). He talks a lot in class, super intelligent, and every time I’d look up to listen, he’d be staring right back at me, every single time. I came to think he probably liked me. Being the  sneaky person I am, I sat right beside him hoping it’d help me land a good partner for a group project. It worked. He wanted to pair up, and it went great. At first I wasn’t interested in him at all, it was purly for a grade, but he’s definitely attractive, and very driven and fun to talk to, so I quickly became interested. 

But then we started sitting together every day, chatting before and after class, walking home together, finding out we have a lot in common, and becoming good friends. He still stares at me a lot, (when I'm looking and when he thinks I'm not looking) asks me tons of questions, and remembers literally everything I’ve ever said. I found him on Instagram, he started texting me, helped me get a really valuable intern position, and he’s even asked about my ex. This man works almost full-time *and* goes to school full-time, yet somehow still asks me to get coffee, walk around campus, and go to several other places. Hes increadibly kind and generous to me, and has tried to pay for my coffee and stuff before. The problem is  he dosent show any romantic intentions. He has never directly asked me on a date, never touches me or ever gives me compliments or says anything clearly flirty (despite my attempts), and after almost 3 months of this I’m starting to be disheartened and think he just sees me as a friend.

I’m looking for 3-5 players to join my new D&D 5e (2014 rules) homebrew campaign inspired by “Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and “Dispatch”: Espresso K’Nights ...a floating, teleporting coffee tavern by day and a vigilante dispatch headquarters by night.
 This campaign blends workplace comedy, heartfelt character-driven storytelling, and street-level action and mystery in a world where your barista shift matters just as much as your nighttime adventures.

 The Campaign: Espresso K’Nights
Players work at a magical sky-tavern that drifts across the realm.
 By day, you’ll handle barista shifts, eccentric customers, coworker drama, and side gigs.
 By night, you become K’Nights ...vigilantes dispatched to investigate magical anomalies, solve crimes, and uncover a growing conspiracy affecting every region the tavern teleports to.
We lean heavily into:
Immersive, character-focused roleplay


Found-family vibes


Player-driven choices


Workplace systems (shift scores, side gigs, reputation)


Investigations and branching night missions


Cinematic storytelling with humor, tension, and consequences


Your actions during the day can literally change your odds of survival at night.
 Your decisions during night missions shape where the tavern goes next ...and how the world sees the K’Nights.

 What I’m Looking For
A roleplay-forward player who enjoys character arcs, connections, and chaos


Someone committed to consistent weekly attendance


A collaborative storyteller who lifts others up and respects table vibes


Someone who enjoys comedy, heart, mystery, and teamwork


Players comfortable with a balance of lighthearted daytime fun + serious night missions


Absolutely no evil-aligned or disruptive loner characters

One thing is clear. Anyone who finds out I work here, the reaction is always the same. ""Why does everything you do suck?!"" A few years back, I thought hey, maybe people are just being a little critical. But now... I'm starting to finally see it.

**The WoW example**

I used to play WoW too for many years, and it's wild seeing how badly developed this game is now, with a trillion dollar market cap gaming company at the helm of their game. You'd think that this company, with their vast resources, expertise in programming, and now being in possession of ""pandora's box"", what they keep calling Artificial Intelligence, they'd be able to make massive changes to improve quality and efficiency of everything. Everything is broken in this game. I'm on an RTX 5070 TI gaming rig that PCMR community helped me build, all updates applied and drivers installed fresh..... and WoW crashes, a lot. The guild finder is outdated, and doesn't even work. The writing is subpar, and complained about by most players. It's shocking. How do we have so many brilliant devs, and we simply cannot fix the most BASIC THINGS in this game?

If there was ONE thing I'd fix with this pitiful game, **it would bet he Guild Finder**. It's a simple search engine, which I cannot fathom HOW the WoW dev team messed up or cannot figure out. It makes zero sense. A first-year college student in CS could make a search engine in like, a week. How can this billion dollar company not figure out how to make a search engine, sorted by size/number of people?

**AI is a huge myth**

Here inside Microsoft, we refer to AI as ""pandora's box"", and are instructed by our leaders to ""use it as a thought partner"" in all of our tasks, our daily workflow, everything.... and I measured meticulously my output, my efficiency, everything.... **My performance has gone down using AI**. Yes, I followed every tech bro training course they try to spoon feed us inside the org, use all the AI workflows, the productivity tips, I've done it all. **AI is simply not accurate, not reliable, and HAS NOT IMPROVED.** 25-40% of the data, answers, solutions we get out of it, is wrong. But no one talks about those. ""We're working on improving that"" we hear, over and over again. Okay.... WHEN? It's been 3 months, 6 months, 9 months... same exact issues, but our productivity is expected to dramatically increase with this ""foundational new tool""

  
**They don't care what consumers want anymore**

You can use a simple search of this subreddit, the web, contact marketing research to determine what consumers have said in feedback forums or surveys to microsoft....

These ""directors"" of AI engineering are so hopelessly f\*%king deranged suggesting the most asinine things I've ever heard of in some of these meetings.

No need to open Excel at 9 AM now, it'll just prompt you with a popup if you want to open it (or do it automatically). what's next, will the agent log in for you and start your work for you while you make coffee then you pick up where it left off?

This weekend has been busy but so cool. Friday I went ice skating with some friends. I really enjoyed just going fast, zooming over the ice. I fell once but I was okay.

Saturday I ended up jamming to some Greek folk music with a group of Greek people. I knew one of them vaguely and he had invited me. They had all these cool instruments that I don't even remember the names of. I just had my guitar. Luckily for me, there was one other guy who also played the guitar who helped me understand which chords to play, because I was feeling quite lost otherwise. But honestly it was such a cool experience and I learned a lot.

My Turkish friend, MC, was also there, playing the oud. After the jam session we went to his place and had dinner. I ended up staying quite late and I was still feeling the effect of the ouzo that the Greek guys had served me (it was 40% or something), so MC asked me to stay the night at his place. He had offered me to stay over several times before, but this was the first time I said yes.

So he made up the sofa bed. He gave me some pyjamas and a toothbrush, a charger. He asked me five times if I really had everything I needed. And then he went to bed. And I made myself comfortable on the sofa. 

After he left the room, I felt a wave of fear coming over me. What am I doing, going to someone's house, a *man's* house, staying the night, with no one else there? But I also knew that nothing bad was gonna happen to me there. So I lay there for a while, listening to the sounds outside, and I quickly calmed down.

I must have dreamt like a million different dreams. I can remember at least five of them: some were happy dreams, some were scary, and most of them featured MC.

I woke up around 9 and chilled on the couch a little. MC emerged from his room a while later. He sat next to me on the couch, we chatted for a bit, and he put his head on my shoulder. It just felt so precious. 

He made us breakfast, and nice coffee. He was humming and singing tunes literally the whole time, it was so cute. I gave him a very tight hug before I left. And that was it. 

That was it. I was outside. I had not been hurt. If anything I was maybe slightly annoyed, because he didn't let me help cook the breakfast (I had to watch him prepare Gouda in all the wrong ways, and I'm *Dutch* for Christ's sake). But overall I was feeling good. Quite happy I would say. 

Idk what this was to him, or why he wanted me to stay over. Heck, I doubt he has a clear answer to that himself. For me though, apart from spending some good times with my friend, I was also deliberately trying something out. Rationally, I knew that this guy would never lay a finger on me, so I figured this might be a safe opportunity to actually experience that. To be a bit closer and more vulnerable with someone, and have nothing disastrous happen.

I'm still unpacking how I feel about the whole thing, obviously it's quite mixed. It kinda feels when you're walking outside and you hear a really loud bang so you feel scared, only to realize a few moments later that it was just someone closing a trash can really loudly. Anyways, I'll take my time to process things. We take it step by step.",2,1764535455.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

1pasulv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pasulv/30_days_again_but_optimistic_this_time/,30 days - again - but optimistic this time,"ignore the counter in my flair, I tried to reset but it didn't work. 

Just hit 30 days again, will do one more at 100 (hopefully). Posting both for some personal accountability as well as other's anecdotes helped me when I have dealt with various things. I've tried and fallen off the bike a few times in the last couple years, I'm taking the fact that I keep trying as hopeful, and it does feel different this time. I'm not waiting until I can start drinking again, I'm trying, mostly successfully, to embrace the good of this lifestyle change. 

quick context, I was definitely drinking more than I should have (nightly) before covid, during covid it became nights and weekends, after covid and then after getting laid off (not alcohol related) the concept of day and night became arbitrary and if I didn't have job interviews why not Irish up that coffee. The week before I stopped it was morning drinks, crash out, afternoon/evening drinks, then pass out around bedtime. Pretty much no food in this week. The first three days of when I stopped I was in bed all day with a bucket nearby for nausea. 

The bad:

People in this sub have been pretty candid that stopping isn't immediate sunshine and rainbows. It's better than being hungover but I didn't and still don't feel amazing, just better than I did. 

* Sobriety fatigue hit me really hard this time, never had that during previous times I stopped. In the first two weeks I was napping midday and had a hard time keeping my eyes open past 7pm. At 30 days its getting better
* I broke my ankle this summer (also not alcohol related) so some of the stuff people suggest to feel better isn't available to me, I can't really walk long distances, doing what I can
* I have felt generally crummy, clumsy
* I'm kind of short tempered, I was always a ""happy"" drunk so I think this is just my physiology adjusting, this also has been getting better 
* I got gout AFTER I stopped, this happened once before, annoying but I can still walk short distances
* This is going in the good and bad list but my appetite came roaring back, the bad part of this is my desire for sugary food. Fortunately this too has been mellowing out

The good:

* The sleep, omg the sleep. It's not head hits the pillow and out, it's more 20-30 minutes of mentally debriefing then sleep, but the sleep is REM, I do dream. I don't toss and turn with spinning thoughts. I don't wake up at 3-4am
* Appetite is back, and this includes vegetables and healthier foods. Also semi-related but I don't DoorDash anymore, I cook, and don't wake up after passing out with a bunch of food I drunkenly left on the counter needing to toss into the trash
* Family all commented on how much better I looked at Thanksgiving, I don't know if I've lost much if any weight but my face is thinner, less red, eyes not blood shot
* I no longer have a tremor and can use a fork and knife or bring a glass of water to my face 
* In the last year or so I had a thing where the dehydration from alcohol caused the throat mucus to harden, and coughing or clearing my throat would often trigger a gag reflex and dry heaves. This made me afraid to get into cars
* I am still me, I can still talk to people
* I was always very careful to never drive when I was drinking but its now something I don't even need to think about or plan for

The funny: 

* There are quite few tv series and movies on my streaming services that I've ""watched"" and have no recollection of. So there's quite a few things I get to watch that are fresh
* I still have alcohol in the house, having it nearby isn't really a trigger, maybe I'm lucky in that regard but its something I can get delivered so I can't play a lifetime game of keep away, but what's funny is I have a fruit fly issue (probably related to the food left on the counter). Fruit flies love whiskey, so I get to dispose of what I have left while watching fruit flies do their version of whatever Nicolas Cage was doing in Leaving Las Vegas

I have some medical appointments coming up for issues unrelated to alcohol and it's another motivation for me. Alcohol didn't cause the issues but it certainly doesn't help. 

Anyway, sorry for the long post. Hopefully part of this is resonant for anyone. IWNDWYT

1pasqki,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1pasqki/where_can_i_buy_a_smart_plug_for_home_automation/,Where can I buy a smart plug for home automation?,"Looking for a smart plug to upgrade your home? You're in the right place. Smart plugs are one of the easiest ways to start automating your house without breaking the bank.

**What Makes Smart Plugs Worth It?**

A smart plug lets you control any device from your phone. Think about turning off your coffee maker from bed, or making sure your curling iron is off after you've already left for work. You can also set schedules so your lights turn on automatically when it gets dark, or have your fan shut off after you fall asleep.

Most smart plugs work with Alexa, Google Assistant, and other voice controllers. This means you can control your stuff just by talking. No more getting up to flip switches.

**Where to Buy Smart Plugs**

Amazon is honestly your best bet for buying smart plugs. They have tons of options, competitive prices, and fast shipping if you have Prime. Plus, you can read real reviews from people who actually bought and used them.

You can check out a solid selection of smart plugs here: https://athomewave.com/smart-plug

**What to Look For**

When shopping for a smart plug, keep these things in mind:

- Make sure it works with your voice assistant (Alexa, Google Home, etc.)
- Check if you need a hub or if it connects straight to your WiFi
- Look at the amp rating to make sure it can handle your devices
- Some plugs have energy monitoring so you can see how much power you're using

**Setting Them Up is Easy**

Most smart plugs take about five minutes to set up. You just plug them in, download the app, and follow the instructions. Then you can start controlling your devices right away.

**Price Range**

Smart plugs usually cost between $10 and $30 depending on features. The basic ones are cheap and work great for simple stuff. Fancier models have energy tracking and work with more smart home systems.

**Getting Started**

If you're ready to make your home smarter, head over to https://athomewave.com/smart-plug to see your options. Start with one or two plugs for the devices you use most. Lamps and fans are perfect for beginners. Once you see how convenient they are, you'll probably want more.

Smart home automation doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. A couple of wireless plugs can make your daily routine so much easier. No more wondering if you left something on, no more fumbling for light switches in the dark.",1,1764534970.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

Ive never had anger issues or have done anything like this before.

Anyway, I mentioned all of this to my therapist and she said something that really raised my eyebrows. She asked me if I have been playing a new game called Arc Raiders. I said yes, and she started vigorously writing something in her notepad. I asked her why she asked me that question, but she just changed the subject and ended the session shortly after.

[$500],"I have a seen posts similar to this, but none that quite capture my situation (especially with the new Gaggia model, since previous discussions seem to center around the Classic Pro or Evo Pro) so I wanted to ask, especially with the BF sales floating around. I understand grinder is extremely important, and will likely get a DF54 or DF64. 

This will be my first home espresso machine, as I mostly do pourover. I worked as a barista at a small coffee roaster about few years ago, and have an appreciation for good coffee, but I do plan to mostly use the machine for milk-based drinks. Achieving quality microfoam for latte art is very important to me, as I love the art of milk steaming. The machine would get used ~3-4 times per week, with me and my partner each having a latte. We also homemake syrups that we would use occasionally, so perfect shot quality is not the most important since syrups would mask any imbalances in flavor. 

I was leaning towards the BBP while it’s on sale due to the fast heat up time, beginner friendliness out of the box, and what seems to be a decent steam wand, but where I hesitate is that there seem to be a lot of issues with durability and from the once or twice I have used one in the past at a friends, it has looked and felt like a toy with all of the flimsy bits. 

The Gaggia E24 seems to have upgrades from the previous models with the brass boiler and the steam wand seems much more powerful than previous models (great for latte art), but I’m wondering if the hassle of using the machine out of the box is worth it if we plan to mostly have milk based drinks, and we need to make two back to back drinks each time we use it. I am an engineer and would be comfortable modding the machine if needed, but I am hesitant to spend that much money on a machine if I could get good enough results from a different machines out of the box. That being said, the durability and experience of using it seems more akin to what I have worked with on commercial machines, which is appealing. 

Right now, the Gaggia E24 is $450, and the BBP is $400. I imagine I would need to budget an additional $100 or so for accessories for the Gaggia, bringing its cost up to ~$550 not including any mods. With the brass boiler, how important would the PID mod be? Given our propensity for milk drinks, which would you choose? Or would you consider looking at other machines in the $700 price range that already include a PID?

Thanks so much, greatly appreciate any help! ",1,1764534915.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

He offered to meet up at the local gym, but I told him it was serious—about Lila—and we asked if he could come meet at our dorm to keep it more private. He arrived at the dorm just two hours after that. Marcus was soaking wet, which I was relieved to find smelled more like a shower than sweat. His face was red, and if I hadn’t seen his truck in the parking lot. I would have thought he had run the entire way.

“Hey, thanks for inviting me over,” Marcus said, taking a seat.

“Let’s go to Kaia’s room,” I replied quickly, nodding in the direction of the door. Marcus nodded. Tears were welling up in his eyes. I hadn’t even told him what was wrong yet… I had never seen him so anxious. He still tried to crack dumb, jocky jokes— a sorry attempt to waft some tension out of the air.

“Hey, sounds good to me. If two cute girls tell me to follow them to the bedroom, then I don’t ask twice!” He laughed, but he didn’t sound happy. His joke would have usually summoned a smile from me —and a look of disdain from Kaia— but we both just shot each other sympathetic frowns. As soon as Kaia closed the door, Marcus broke down.

“What’s wrong with her, Jordan? Is Lila okay?” He collapsed his head into his hands before running them nervously through his hair.

“She’s alive, she’s not really hurt either, just take a breath…” 

“She’s pregnant,” Kaia said in a monotone cadence, like a basketball buzzer. Marcus’s face went from shock, to fury, to sadness in all but a few seconds. His fists clenched, then unclenched. A tear rolled down his cheekbone. 

“Pregnant? And she didn’t tell me? For how long? What do you know?” he sputtered in disbelief.

“That’s all she told us, Marcus. She joined that church group, and they’ve convinced her to follow through with having it, but I don’t know anything else. Is there a chance it could be yours?” I asked him timidly.

“Chance it could be mine…Dude, of course, there’s a chance it could be mine. We were going at it like crazy right before she ghosted me,” he said, tears began streaming. I cringed. 

“Oh…okay. That’s all we needed to know…” Kaia said, stifling any more unnecessary details.

“What the hell is this church group? She always talked about it before we broke up, but I thought it was just her trying to get her shit together. What the fuck is going on here?” he asked. 

Kaia crossed her arms and sighed.

“It’s more than just a church group. We don’t know for sure yet, but they’re targeting Jordan too, and we don’t know why. They stole her dorm key, her jacket… Lila’s acting like she’s brainwashed, talking about ‘Divine Perfection’ and ‘God’s gift.’ We think she’s in deep and maybe that they’re dangerous.” She put a hand on my shoulder. I nodded before jumping to the floor and searching for the evidence folder from under Kaia’s bed. I slid my hand in between the storage tubs, but my heart jolted. It wasn’t there.

“Did you move it?” I asked Kaia.

“The folder? No…” she said. I bent down on my knees. The folder was no longer between the tubs, but was lying on top of one of them.

“Dude, it’s here, but it’s not where I left it. Do you swear you didn’t touch it?” I panicked. Kaia nodded.

“I mean…yeah. I don’t think I did…” she stuttered.

“She was only in the bathroom for like, thirty seconds… how could she have even known to look there?”

“I don’t know, maybe I did put it on top? I don’t know…”

“What are you guys talking about You’re freaking me out, man,” Marcus said. I shook my head.

“It doesn’t matter. We’re being messed with by these people.” I flipped through the folder. All of the papers were still there. “Look. These are the flyers they hand out. And this…” I slipped him the photo of the altar. “This was in Lila’s closet when we went over to her house. She’s really sucked into it.” 

“Oh, fuck, man. Oh no… What the hell is this stuff? I should have went to that church with her. I’m so stupid. If I just would have caught on to some of this, maybe I could have…could have done something.”

“That’s why we brought you here,” I admitted. “We’re going to the revival this Saturday…to get proof of whatever weird stuff is going on there…recordings, photos…anything we can use to prove she’s not okay. We were hoping that you could come with us. You know, wait in the car in case something goes wrong. Then, when we get the pictures, we will know if we should call the police or try to get her admitted somewhere for religious psychosis or something. Anything just to get her out.” The words felt wrong on my breath. Marcus ran a hand through his damp hair, his eyes wide.

“Religious psychosis? Like, you think she’s *crazy?”*

“Not crazy,” I said quickly. “But she’s not herself. You saw how she was with the eating disorder. This feels like that, but worse. If we can show she’s being manipulated, maybe her parents can get her help. A hospital, a deprogrammer, something.” I didn’t even know what I was implying Lila needed. Marcus nodded slowly, his jaw tight.

“If she’s in trouble, I wanna help. Just tell me what you need.” Kaia leaned in.

“Backup. If things go south at the revival, we need someone nearby who can step in. You don’t come inside unless we text you pomegranate. Even if we are begging you to come in, it could be a trap. We will park a little ways down the gravel road and walk to the church so no one sees you. But you should still keep your head down and keep your phone on.”

“Pomegranate. Got it,” Marcus said, his voice firm, before momentarily softening to his usual dumbfounded look. “That’s like those red fruits with the white stuff and black dots inside, right?”

I sighed. Kaia released a well-needed half-smile.

“No, that’s a dragon fruit. Pomegranate has all the red juicy seeds inside—” Kaia began, but I cut her off.

“It doesn’t matter! It’s just a fruit!” I hissed. Marcus took a shaky breath between moments of stupor.

“You guys think these people are dangerous?” He asked. I thought back to Ruth’s black eye, Esther’s shaved head and sobs, and the blood on Lila’s altar. It felt silly to say we didn’t have enough evidence to prove they were dangerous, but we still didn’t have enough for the police to be involved and for anything to get done about it. We were in an everlasting Mobius Strip of doubt, encroaching on the edge of a horror we had yet to comprehend.

“Yes, I do. Something really weird is going on here. I don’t know if anyone else has noticed, but Lila has also gained a lot of weight back.”

“That’s great!” Marcus said. “Maybe she’s getting better finally—”

“No, it’s not like that,” I replied. “She’s heavier than I’ve ever seen her since high school. And when we went to her house, Kaia and I, last week or so…she ate so much food. Like at least five slices of pizza, a whole box of garlic knots, cinnamon twists, a liter of soda, and a huge muffin. I thought it was performative…like she was trying to prove to me that her eating disorder had gone away, but I think they’re like…I don’t know, never mind.”

“No, say it,” Kaia urged, placing a hand on my knee. “I thought it was weird, but I don’t know her like you do, and I don’t know what all of that could be about.” Kaia pressed her lips together tightly before glancing over to Marcus.

“Do you think these church people are fattening her up or something?” he asked, his eyes wild with confusion.

“No…I don’t know. It’s weird, but I do think they’re forcing her to eat…somehow,” I blurted out. Kaia side-eyed me. 

“Why would they do that? How could they do that?”

“I told you, I don’t know. It was something she said when she came over last night. ‘Food is fuel.’ Something about that was just…off.”

“I mean, I say that all the time,” Marcus replied. “When your body is growing, you need to fuel it.”

“Yeah,” I said. “With protein and vegetables and stuff… Not half of the Casey’s takeout pizza menu.” I huffed, “You know what? Forget it. I don’t even know what I’m talking about…It’s just weird, okay?”

“Jordan, I believe you,” Kaia admitted. “There is something going on, and we don’t have the full picture.”

“Yeah, Jo. You’ve seen her more than me lately. If anyone knows what’s up, it’s you guys. If you’re going in there to get her back, I’m coming too. And I’m not leaving without her,” Marcus added. Kaia put a hand on his back, patting him lightly. Marcus looked up. “But we need to all be prepared and stuff.”

“Prepared how? We’ve already looked at the cell service map, made a safe word, and are bringing a gun. I don’t know how else to prepare.” I sighed and glanced at him. He stood up.

“You guys come with me.” Marcus motioned us toward the door. He peeked out of the front window before beckoning us over again. Kaia and I pulled on our sneakers and headed out.

“Where are you taking us? Do you know something we don’t?” Kaia asked, almost distrustfully. I shot her a look. Marcus wouldn’t screw us over like that.

“No, but I have done some stupid shit before. I have some ideas.” He replied, almost mustering a grin. Before I knew it, Kaia, Marcus, and I were loaded into his truck. He started it up, all of us sitting in silence for a moment before Marcus awkwardly turned on the radio. The first place we went was his house. I didn’t see much of it, as my mind was racing, but I had been there once or twice before. Only now, there were more trees looming over the property that desperately needed to be trimmed. Marcus unbuckled.

“You guys stay right here. I will be right back,” he assured Kaia and me before locking us in the truck. I looked behind me. Kaia had her head pressed against the back window of the cab. I climbed over the console and slid into the middle seat beside her. She gave me a weak grin.

“This is all a lot,” she said quietly. I nodded. 

“I’m sorry. I know it’s not your fight to fight. If you want Marcus and I to take it from here—”

“No. I want to go. It’s just all so freaky.”

“We’re so close. It’s going to be over soon,” I assured her. Kaia put her arm around me. 

“Yeah. Honestly, they’re just religious freaks. It’s not like we’re dealing with the Manson family or anything. And even if we were…I think we’re way smarter than them.”  

I sighed, and a smile crept up my face. Marcus opened the back door to the cab, holding what looked to be a hunting bag. It was like a sports duffel but covered in camouflage print.

“Damn, I was only gone a second. You guys already scissoring back here?” he asked. I giggled but looked over to Kaia, who wasn’t amused. Marcus turned red.

“Sorry…Sometimes, the jokes don’t land.” He coughed. “My bad, Kaia.”

“It’s fine.” Kaia rolled her dark eyes. I could tell she really wanted to be pissed off at him, but she found it kind of funny too. A smile peeked out from behind the annoyance painted on her face.

“For real, though. I’ll can it, on God,” Marcus added, tossing the hunting bag into the floorboard before hopping back into the driver’s seat. He started up the truck and began to back out.

“Where to next?” I asked him, hoping to lighten the mood. He glanced back in the rearview mirror and grinned proudly.

“The Happiest Place on Earth, Jo. *Best Buy.”* A glimmer of pure excitement seemed to seep from the pores of his face. I raised an eyebrow and looked to Kaia.

“Best Buy is the happiest place on Earth?” Kaia smirked. Marcus nodded religiously. “Yeah dude, they have everything.” The truck rumbled out of the gravel driveway and onto the blacktop, all of us chuckling over Marcus’s strange excitement for a tech store that might be irrelevant within the next decade. We arrived and, upon entering, began looking at all the shiny gadgets that had seemingly no purpose. 
Bluetooth vacuum cleaner, self-warming and self-stirring coffee mug, a red-light-therapy mask for your teeth… this place used to be relevant before Amazon. Now it was overfilled with fake “techy” junk. I wasn’t sure how you’d find anything useful in there without asking, but Marcus seemed to know straight where he was going, though. While Kaia and I window-shopped through aisles of 100-foot HDMI cables and USB converters, Marcus had arrived back at the front of the store with his arms full of stuff.

“How are you paying for all of this?” I asked, examining the multitude of boxes he clutched to his chest.

“Well, college girl, I have a full-time job.” He said it like there was going to be some grand punchline that never arrived. Kaia snorted.
We got back to the truck. Marcus wasted no time. He began opening all his goodies like an elated child on Christmas morning, as if it were 2007 and he was unraveling the undeniable cosmic power and supernatural glory of the Imaginext Batcave.

“All right, what’s the haul?” Kaia asked him.

“You’re about to find out. Grab me some of that duct tape from my bag, will you, Jo?” I unzipped the bag and found the duct tape lying on top. I handed the roll to him, and he ripped off a long piece with his teeth. Marcus had bought two sets of radios, the kind of Walkie-Talkies police and forest rangers used. He strategically began wrapping the duct tape around them, careful not to cover the speaker, dial, or buttons, before retrieving something else out of the Best Buy bag. It was Bluetooth GPS tabs. 

“There,” he said, pride dripping off his words. With a smile, he held up his invention: a walkie-talkie radio duct-taped to an Apple AirTag. Somewhere, across the millennia of time and space, perhaps even across inconceivable planes of existence, the spirits of the world’s greatest inventors—DaVinci, Edison, Graham, Bell—all quivered at the conception of this summit of unseen innovation. 
I had to hand it to him, though. *It was pretty sweet.*

“Damn…” Kaia said. “Get this guy a Nobel Prize. That’s actually sick, Marcus.” Marcus handed Kaia and me the remaining boxes, setting the duct tape roll on the middle console so we could all reach it.

“Go crazy, ladies. Get started. We need three more.” Kaia and I shared a look before tearing into the boxes of radios and duct tape. We sat in the Best Buy parking lot, and while we worked, we found comradery in Marcus’s untapped potential and generosity. The truck cab was soon filled with chuckles and casual conversation as Marcus revealed the rest of his plans to us.

“So, throw those in the hunting bag. I’ve also got my brother’s handgun in there, extra rounds, and some bear spray. If I’m going to keep watch, I’m gonna be armed. This way, we will be able to keep up with one another, and we won’t have to worry about cell service. If something does go wrong, surely one of us will be able to track each other. Or at least get coordinates for the cops.”

“Not too shabby, Marcus,” Kaia said smugly, patting him on the back. Marcus’s face held a grin for a moment but soon fell.

“Anything for Lila,” he replied before turning the key over in the ignition. The trip home was pretty calm. Marcus dropped us off at our apartment door and waited for us to get inside before driving away. 

Kaia and I locked ourselves in and did a headcount for the other two girls who lived in the unit before heading to bed. We didn’t know what kind of horrors were awaiting us at the so-called Ministry, but when the time came, we would at least be ready. We hoped so, anyway. While I settled into bed that night, I thought about how appreciative I was to have Marcus in our corner. If not for the extra protection, just because I hadn’t given him enough credit. If anyone was going to get Lila back, it was him.

I'm hoping for support and perspective because I am lost in survival mode while trying to create a peaceful life. I'm a stay-at-home, homeschooling mom to two young kids( 4&5)

The Core of the Problem:

My husband is not a very motivated person. He works infrequently in construction, is deeply pessimistic about everything, and often makes simple tasks seem impossible. 
For years, ive tried to be his cheerleader to inccourage him to do things that bring him joy like playing music, hunting, playing video games, & even pushing him towards his dreams he talks about. I've poured my energy into motivating him to wake up happy and ready for work, bringing him coffee in the morning even trying to start the day with a bj or morning sex only to have him still get up and yell at me over something insignificant. My efforts were not just unappreciated; they are often punished and unreciprocated. He never hypes me up and make a stink if I ask him for the bare minimum like to bring me coffee in the morning or watch the kids one morning so I can sleep in.

He holds me to a standard of perfection he doesn't apply to himself (e.g., he will sleep due to inssomia, hangover or ibs until 1 PM and then wake up and call me ""lazy""). He lectures me on doing things at the highest standards turning every minor imperfection into a moral failing on my part.

I know he's at war with himself. He has chronic health issues he self-sabotages, his family dynamic is toxic, and he consumes a lot of negative, conspiracy-oriented media (like Alex Jones) that seems to fuel his anger and suspicion. He then projects his own feelings of failure and lack of control onto me.

The Letter and His Reaction:

After a lot of reflection, I wrote him a long, heartfelt letter. I explained that his criticism was creating an unsafe environment and dimming my creative spark. I took responsibility for my own reactions (like withdrawing). I asked him to respond in writing so we could finally break the cycle. It really took weeks to write and was a lot for me to get my feelings all on paper. 

He read it, and his reaction was to get angry and call my feelings a ""delusion."" Also told me I should read the Bible and study forgiveness . He wants me to admit that I am lazy and won’t admit that he has any role in the shortcomings of our family.

Now I am left feeling disconnected shifted to where I do not interact with him like I used to. “ I have dropped the rope” I don’t expect much from him, it’s no way to live. 

This is Why I'm Stuck and My Big Shift in Fear:

I know I can't live like this forever, but the idea of leaving is paralyzing.

The Trauma Paradox: My life has been filled with intense, chaotic trauma (an abusive father, emotionaly & financially unstable childhood, my sister's life-altering accident, helping parent her children in my early 20s). Paradoxically, this ""stable"" life with my husband, even with the constant emotional abuse, feels less chaotic than the storms I've survived before. I am terrified of disrupting my kids' lives and willingly walking back into another fire when I am already so tired.

The Fear of a Wasted Life : My ""sunny disposition"" has been my survival tool my whole life. I've always had to believe that things will work out. But I am now genuinely scared that by staying, I am going to miss my own opportunity for peace. The fear of waking up in 20 years, completely drained and a shell of myself, is starting to become greater than the fear of the chaos of leaving.

Financial Dependence: I am a SAHM with no income of my own. We have joint debts, and all our extra money goes to the kids. I can't afford therapy, let alone the cost of starting a new life.

The ""Did I Try Hard Enough?"" Guilt: A huge part of me is terrified of being the one to tear our family apart. What if this is just a hard phase? What if I give up too soon? The thought that I could just ""be better"" and fix this is a constant battle in my mind, even though I know I've tried so hard.

My Core Question:

 I am watching this beautiful ""golden era"" of my kids' childhood be tarnished by this shadow. I know I could be a better, more joyful, and more present mother if I weren't so emotionally drained. I can't imagine being treated this way forever, but I also can't imagine blowing up our family. 

Has anyone been in this specific kind of trap? How do you overcome the fear of chaos when it's all you've ever known? How do you know when you've ""tried hard enough""?

TL;DR: My unmotivated, emotionally abusive husband rejected my final, heartfelt attempt to fix our marriage. I've spent years pouring my energy into him with no return. I'm a financially dependent SAHM with a deep trauma history. My lifelong fear of chaos is now being replaced by a new, more powerful fear: the fear of missing my own chance at peace by staying.

1pasmku,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pasmku/is_my_professor_and_me/,Is my professor and me...?,"Last year I started a new life at this very high-status private school. I’d always been a public-school kid, and honestly, I enjoyed it the most. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, and back in public school, most of the other students were jealous of me—not because of my personality, but because I tended to date older guys, and my friend group was usually older too. To be completely honest, I’ve always thought I was very pretty, especially for my age. I often looked older than I was—I looked 17 when I was 13, 15 when I was 13… you get the idea.

I was the type of student who got straight A’s, but I also liked to smoke and drink. With all that said, I decided to switch schools to focus on my future and get into medical school.

My first year at the private school was tough, but this year—my second—I decided to fully be myself and show my true colors. I’ve got a lot of friends, both in and out of school, and I usually get along well with the teachers too.

This year we have a new physics teacher, a young man in his late 20s. At first, I hated him. Physics has always been one of my worst subjects, and he was strict but fair. During one of our arguments, he told me I could complain all I wanted… once my grades got better. That challenge lit a fire under me—I started studying more, participating more, and slowly we began chatting. At first, it was playful teasing and friendly “bullying,” but over time, it started to feel like more than that.

I know his schedule by heart, and he jokes that I know it better than he does. During breaks, I usually wait for him at our usual spot with my coffee in hand. We talk about everything—his life, mine, school, university stories—anything. He calls me a crybaby and grumpy, and he’s always teasing me to stop complaining about physics and just ask him for help when I need it. Sometimes we stay after class discussing problems, and yes, I even get a little jealous when he pays more attention to other students.

One time, I went to clean the whiteboard, and he called me a “good girl.” When another student stepped up to clean it, I grabbed the sponge and said, “What do you think you’re doing?” He just smiled and told me I should protect my spot next time. Even other teachers notice us—one mentioned that he often says he enjoys my company and that he’s glad to have a student like me, someone determined and confident.

Whenever I see him in the halls, he smiles and teases me about what I’m doing outside—playful, not scolding. And for the record, I used to hate him at first; he was the one who made the first move to befriend me. But now… things are different. He tells me I brighten his day in front of the whole class. He waits for me when he enters the room. He gives me extra homework (just to spend more time together). And when my friends and I run into him, we usually drift off to have our own little conversations, just the two of us... generally so many things that I can't even process or write. 

I can’t deny it anymore—what started as teasing and competition has grown into something more. I don’t know exactly where it’s headed, but I'm sooo confused whether I should give him a hint or not...",1,1764534708.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

Short Devotional about Generosity

Introduction
------------

In a world that often prioritizes self-interest, the radiant beauty of generosity shines all the brighter. Imagine the impact we can have when we choose to lead with open hearts, offering our time, talents, and resources to others. Generosity is not just about giving; it’s about living a life that blesses others and enriches our own spirit in the process.

Being generous is a powerful way to reflect God’s love in our daily lives. When we extend a helping hand, lend a listening ear, or share what we have, we become conduits of His grace. Welcome to today’s devotional on generosity—may it inspire you to deepen your commitment to giving and receive the countless blessings it brings.

Bible Verse
-----------

“Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.” — Luke 6:38 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

This verse from Luke beautifully encapsulates the reciprocal nature of generosity. It promises that when we give, we set in motion a cycle of blessing. The imagery of abundance—pressed down, shaken together, and running over—illustrates the overflow of blessings that come from a heart inclined to give.

Generosity is not merely about material wealth. It encompasses our actions, words, and attitudes. When we give cheerfully and selflessly, we mirror God’s generous nature. Understanding this principle invites us to live life with open hands and hearts.

The act of giving can transform both the giver and the recipient. It strengthens relationships, fosters community, and cultivates a sense of gratitude. Generosity creates a ripple effect, touching lives in seen and unseen ways, reflecting the Kingdom of God in our midst.

This passage encourages us to adopt a mindset of abundance rather than scarcity, trusting that God multiplies what we offer and returns it manifold. By embracing this promise, we align our hearts with God’s heart, experiencing His profound joy and peace.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Identify an area or a person in need and offer your time, assistance, or resources.

– Practice gratitude daily to cultivate a generous spirit. Thank God for the blessings you have.

– Engage in random acts of kindness, whether it’s paying for someone’s coffee or leaving a generous tip.

– Volunteer at a local charity or church event to give back to your community.

– Share your talents or skills by teaching or mentoring someone else.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– Reflect on a time when someone’s generosity impacted your life. How did it make you feel?

– In what areas of your life can you be more generous? Why do these areas stand out to you?

– Describe how living generously could change your relationship with God and others.

– What fears or hesitations do you have about being generous? How can you overcome them?

– How does generosity make you a better reflection of God’s love?

Prayer
------

Dear Lord, thank You for the countless ways You have blessed me. Help me to reflect Your generosity in my life. Open my heart to give cheerfully and selflessly, and trust in Your promise of abundance. May my actions bring joy, hope, and love to those around me. Guide me in ways I can serve and uplift others for Your glory. Amen.

She is unfortunately struggling to get solid support from her healthcare provider. I am looking to understand as much as I can to make sure we are making the most informed decisions possible.

  
**Some context:**

She is in her 70s and does not yet have any continuous glucose monitor (CGM), so she is routinely pricking her finger many times (10+) a day as she learns to manage her diet appropriately. She has some glucose tablets as well that she uses if her blood sugar drops below 80, which seems like is around where she starts to feel a little dizzy or light-headed.

She is trying to be very cautious about what she eats, but after meals with some (non-simple or refined) carbohydrates (limited to 1/4 cup/meal) she still has some blood sugar dips. 

  
**Questions:**

1. She is working with her doctor to try and understand the cause, but in the meantime is looking to get a CGM. From what I've gathered so far, Dexcom G6/G7 seems to be what we should be after. Is this the right way to go?
2. Currently she is avoiding food about 4 hours before bed and seems to have positive results. I am getting mixed opinions on whether or not this is good. On one hand, a low glycemic index, slow digesting carb, seems like it would make sure blood sugar stays good throughout the night. On the other, until we have solid predictability, it sounds dangerous to eat anything. Does it sound safe for her to continue to have a significant fasting window before bed? I was not too hapy to find recently 3 hours after breakfast her blood sugar was down to \~70. I did confirm with her what she ate, and it wasn't the best choice - some kind of healthy-oritented muffin that had a few ingredients considered ""medium"" glycemic index, and coffee w/ milk (that part should be OK?)
3. My understanding is that glucose tablets **do not** affect insulin production and is safe to take them when it is low. And while sugary drinks may temporarily resolve low blood sugar, they will trigger another crash, specifically because this is reactive hypoglycemia. Does this sound accurate?
4. Are thre any good resources for learning more about this topic that can help with making better decisions? I have a general understanding of the mechanisms behind reactive hypoglycemia but would be happy to learn more. Technical is OK. I am not a medical professional but I am in STEM and have research experience.

Thanks in advance for any input. Please feel free to ask any follow-up questions, I will do my best to answer when I can.",1,1764534474.0,Hypoglycemia,2,1.0,False

Age: 33
Cycle length: ~32 days
Cycle day of blood test: Day 22 (likely late ovulation that cycle)
Family history: Mother has Hashimoto’s (and rheumatoid arthritis, and endometriosis, so a triple whammy of immune diseases). 

Thyroid-related lab results were: 
- TSH: 2.6
- Free T4: 16.6 pmol/L
- Free T3: 5.7 pmol/L
- TPO antibodies: 92 (elevated)
- Thyroglobulin antibodies: 308 (elevated)
- CRP: 0.8 (low inflammation)

Iron status 
- Ferritin: 21 (low)
- Serum iron: 30.6 (high-normal)
- Transferrin saturation: 48% (high-normal)

I took the lab test because I had previously been rejected from blood donation due to low iron in Nov 2023, so I wanted to check how my supplementation (20mg) had been doing. Turns out I’ve been cancelling it out by having it with my breakfast coffee and magnesium. So going to fix that now and take it away from tea/coffee and with vitamin C and retest in 12 weeks. 

Other results (all normal/good)
- CBC normal (neutrophils low-normal at 2.0)
- Lipids excellent (ApoB 0.76, HDL 1.89, LDL 2.32, TG 0.49)
- HbA1c 26 (very good)
- Vitamin D 121 (good)
- Active B12 low normal and folate normal
- Liver & kidney function normal

Hashimoto’s symptoms include
- sensitive to cold (have had this most of my life but worse since mid 20s)
- tendency to constipation (I manage this successfully with sunfiber, magnesium citrate, and careful diet curation); also always an issue, but worse since mid 20s
- brain fog / bad memory; I must do things then and there or write it down
- low libido
- vertical ridges on fingernails
- hair loss in shower (I don’t know what’s normal, but I lose about half my palm’s size of hair when showering)
- dry skin 
- weight management issues (I am  a “normal” bmi currently, but that is with an active lifestyle and carefully curated diet. Was 30-40 lbs overweight as a teenager and young adult.)

Having done some reading online, in addition to trying to improve my ferritin by fixing my iron supplement timing, I’ve started 1000ug b12 (on days not taking iron), 100ug selenium, and 600mg myo-inositol and plan to retest in 12 weeks.

What else can/should I do? I will also see my gp or maybe try to go straight to an endo if my insurance allows. But interested to get insight from others with this condition. Thank you!!",2,1764534335.0,Hashimotos,2,1.0,False

1pasfba,https://www.reddit.com/r/DanielTigerConspiracy/comments/1pasfba/questions_id_ask_the_peppa_pig_producers/,Questions I'd ask the Peppa Pig producers.,"1. Are names temporary? Almost every adult in the show is referred to as a familial role to Peppa and her friends and sometimes called by those new names. If not then it's usually Mr or Ms, and never direct names.
Does this mean that if Peppa becomes a mother, she becomes the new Mummy Pig and George becomes Uncle Pig?

2. Peppatown, why that name? You may have heard this before, but it is said that everyone lives in the fictional city of Peppatown. This is quite concerning as obviously, they wouldn't name a town after a 4 year old that's probably a hundred times younger than it.
This raises 2xpossibilities in my eyes: Peppa is in a sort of secret royal family and the town is named from her as she's the firstborn of Daddy Pig, who is held in high regard (above a king even, as in a train journey episode he is given the right of juice and coffee at once), or Peppa herself is named after Peppatown.

3. Is Ms Rabbit the flash? If you've watched more than 5 episodes of the show you'll know that Ms Rabbit holds up the economy of Peppatown by working most of the important jobs, which frankly would mean disaster as these jobs would overlap with eachother. For example, she works as a bus driver and cashier in the same day, both go on continuously for hours.
In the episode where he gets injured and can't work, all the occupations she holds are empty, meaning there isn't more than one in the general area.

3b. Where do all the Ms Rabbits come from? In New York, an american Ms Rabbit says that 'Every town needs a ms rabbit!' which implies that there's more than one. This is proven several times as there are different versions in different states, and also one on the moon and one in France. Grampy Rabbit must be a madlad.

4. The Moon. Grampy Rabbit has made a rocket that went to the moon to search for Peppa's boots that were stolen by a duck, he did this because it flew away. The only answers for this are that Grampy is a superintelligent hobo or that the Moon is easier to get to, which might explain why a Ms Rabbit has a shop there. Since something so revolutionary and hard to replicate in the real world would not be wasted on a dumb conclusion.",18,1764534234.0,DanielTigerConspiracy,16,0.95,False
1pasfaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MelodyEverAfter/comments/1pasfaf/eat_your_heart_out_part_v/,Eat Your Heart Out: Part V,"Saturday night arrived like a storm cloud looming in the sky. Heavy, menacing, and *inevitable.* I couldn’t help but shake the feeling that even though this might have been the morally right thing to do, our shared pain of going to this revival was a self-inflicted and masochistic blunder on all our parts. As if it were just our own stupidity driving us to the point of coming here, not the fact that Lila was in trouble. 

Kaia was driving, I was in the passenger seat, and Marcus was in the hatchback row with a blanket draped around him. The road was winding, making its way up the old hills that used to be mountains millions of years ago. With every mile, the brush thickened around the car, and the road became more ravenous. The sun was not yet setting, but it was that time of day when it illuminated the world in golden light— splashing orange and yellow drops of glow all around Kaia’s cherry red Honda Civic. A quiet moment of peace before whatever horrors we would be uncovering that night. I couldn’t help but feel like this steep, rugged road was a bit familiar to me, like I had travelled it once before. It was a nauseating bombora of déjà vu that turned in my stomach with the force of the tide.
It was 6:48 in the afternoon when we arrived at 112 Silkwood Grove Circle. The road narrowed as if the trees had a dirty secret to tell us. 
When the glimpse of the first wooden building came into view, we backed the car up about what would have been roughly a block on a normal street. Marcus covered himself up with the blanket, phone in hand. He had also managed to borrow one of his brother’s handguns, which made me feel more secure about our plan. Kaia and I were dressed like one would to attend any Southern church revival: short-sleeve cotton shirts and maxi skirts. I wore trainers, and she wore combat boots—something that might come in handy later.
The gravel was cheap and left a thick powdering of dust in the air when cars weaved in and out of the site, even despite the rain we had gotten over the past few weeks. It crunched under our footsteps while we circled the bend and the church came more clearly into view. 

The main building Kaia and I had originally thought was an old community center loomed out of the darkness—a squat, wooden building half-swallowed by overgrown pines. Dim lights glowed through the windows, and the parking lot was packed with mismatched cars. Some rusted, others pristine. The main building was made of heavy wooden logs, and it was adorned with a green, metal roof. There were several, much smaller buildings off in the distance, webbed together by footpaths. 
My heart thundered in my chest, and I grabbed on to Kaia’s hand. She shot me a look as if to say, “Pomegranate already?”

A deep realization sunk into my chest like a sabre while I took in the sight of the buildings. I had been here before. Just once, when I was a kid. We were at what was left of *Camp Silktree,* the old, abandoned church camp Kaia had asked about back when we first met. The one where Lila and I had found that hair in middle school. I had thought it was *bankrupt?*
I looked around, noticing an ambient hum throughout the camp. The entire place was being powered by generators. A large unit rumbled loudly near the entrance of the main building, close to an open-air storage shed filled with gas containers. I could only assume the people who held church here were some kind of squatters and this place was completely off-grid. It also meant this wasn’t a *real* church. Not one that could be looked up online, anyway. 

I didn’t want to risk telling Kaia what was going through my head and draw attention to ourselves, so I shook it off, squeezed her hand, and continued on.
Inside, the revival was already starting. The air was thick with incense, sweet and cloying, and rows of folding chairs were filled with people of all ages: college kids, older folks, and even a few families. *“How Great Thou Art”* was being sang in unison by some, while others mingled and settled into their seats. 

There were roughly thirty people in the building. I took notice that there were dozens of women in the auditorium, but only a few men speckled the crowd. And to my morbid curiosity, some of the women, roughly one in five, had completely bald heads. My eyes quickly zoned in on Nazarene, Ruth, and Esther, who stood near the front, handing out hymnals. Lila was nowhere in sight. 
The energy in the room felt wrong, like a hasty breath you didn’t have time to fully inhale before being submerged in water.
We took our seats near the back, trying to blend in, when a hush fell over the audience. All at once, the room busted into a song I didn’t recognize. The harmonies were unsettling, like the strange moanings from the score of a pretentious indie film, rounding off into something that barely could have passed as a church hymn. Kaia and I stood politely since we did not know the words. In fact, though I could make out some words, others were mysteries to me. From what I knew of religion, mostly from horror movies, “Dio” meant “God,” so it was probably Latin. This whole thing, this “religion…” as surreal and horrifying as it was, made me more angry, than it made me upset in that moment. The Church seemed to be a hodgepodge of different traditions and practices, cherry-picked from scary films, pagan practices, and Christianity. It was as if they were using the most esoteric and intimidating parts of faith to indoctrinate victims without purpose. I doubted whatever they were worshipping was a “god.” A part of me doubted that any of this was real at all, bringing my feet up to the toe, the old hardwood squeaking beneath my shoes. I stood there, tip-toeing to get a better vantage point. There’s no point trying to find answers as to what this place really was. I don’t think these people even knew what *they* were idolizing. I just wanted to get Lila out and put this all to bed. It made me wonder though, how much of this stuff existed at Camp Silktree while I was enrolled? How long had this been going on?

While the music faded and voices waned, the preacher stepped up to a podium at the front of the room. I recognized the man in an instant. Kaia must have as well. 
It was the Waffle House creeper, his balding head gleaming under the ambient lighting, his grin too wide, too knowing. My blood ran cold, and Kaia’s grip tightened on my hand. I looked to her, but her face showed determination instead of fear. She nodded, so I tried to settle back into my seat.

“Welcome, brothers and sisters,” he said, his voice smooth and oily. “Tonight, we gather to celebrate another week that God has provided us, and we are so blessed. Can I get an amen?” 
The entire auditorium exploded into a unified “amen” before he continued. “Before tonight’s sermon, I’d like to welcome our newest guests.” The man looked up and smiled at the crowd, motioning to a man in the front. My heart was pounding. What is going on? 
“Clinton, is it? This fella right here…” The person named “Clinton” stood up, and the room clapped. “It is so good to have you.” The man searched the crowd for someone I knew to be me. 
We were in the back of the room. We had some time.

“Don’t freak out,” I whispered. Kaia gripped my hand in affirmation. Within a second of the exchange, the preacher continued.

“There they are! Back there! Jordan and Kaia, I was hoping you’d come. It is nice to see you girls again.” His smile was warm and his eyes bright. If he hadn’t stolen my dorm key and pickpocketed my bag, I might have almost judged him to be a sweet, old man. 
I shivered. Kaia and I both rose to our feet, politely waving at the smiling crowd before sitting down. When the man’s eyes released us, I couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief. 

“And Francine? Where are you…? Don’t be shy.” 

A woman stood up and smiled boldly. Something in my brain identified her as familiar. Not because of her face— I didn’t recognize the woman— but because of her shirt. A faded logo, a smudged graphic of a coffee cup that had the words “Brewed Awakening” beneath it. My brain snapped with the connection. The logo on the woman’s T-shirt was identical to the one on the business card on Lila’s altar. My hands shook slightly, and I pulled out my phone, pretending to check a text while snapping a photo of her. Kaia looked at me in confusion. I just nodded.
“Another day graced by the light of the Lord, our God…And as your Minister, you all know well that I am not perfect. I sometimes struggle to find the words as I prepare to bring you messages of hope and salvation. But something called to me last night, and it’s a matter I have been yearning to speak on for a while. And that matter…is the lost.” 

Scattered applause echoed throughout the room. 

“What does it mean to be…lost?” He paused. “Losing something, losing someone, or being lost can be scary. Frustrating. But to be lost is the first step of being found. Luke 15:24 reads, ‘For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to celebrate.’ Is that not the truth?” The crowd roared with approval and various “amens.” A displaced woman let out a scream of raptured agreement. 
“For as long as we are delighted in the Lord, nothing is ever truly lost. Because he keeps all things. The things we misplace, from little things, like cell phones and wallets, to big things, even like our very souls…They all find their way back to us. They bring us together, to this sacred place, to Him.”

The audience boomed in a unified conjecture, seemingly without warning:

“God is coming. He is not what you think!” They all chanted in unison. The preacher gave a satisfied chuckle. 

“Very good. I love to hear it.”

My heart thudded, but I forced myself to smile, to nod like I was enraptured. Kaia’s phone buzzed…She was recording, her hand steady despite the heavy tension in her jaw “Ladies and gentleman, I’d like to take this moment to recognize a dear friend of mine,” said the preacher. He gestured to the side, and Lila stepped forward, her pregnant belly more pronounced than humanly possible under a plain, white dress. It must have been the size of a basketball already. How could that be? 
*I just saw her two nights ago, and I could barely even tell.* 

The crowd erupted in applause when he continued.

“God has brought us a gift in our sweet Delilah, our newest matriarch. She is a keeper of lost things, a vessel for His will. Through her, our church will grow strong and alive with new members.”

Lila’s smile was radiant, but her eyes were glassy and distant. She didn’t look at us. In fact, she didn’t seem to see anyone. My throat tightened. Keeper of lost things. The phrase echoed in my mind. I thought back to the altar in her closet, how she had been in possession of my lost key. The preacher continued. “Many of you have wondered about Delilah’s condition. And may I say that she is doing fabulous. Blessed are the mothers who bring life.” 

The preacher man babbled on, but Lila seemed to look off into the distance. Her stare was vacant. Her green eyes glazed over like a dead man’s. 

“Bring forth your bounty!”

*Bounty…what?*

One by one, churchgoers stood and formed a line in front of the podium, where the preacher and Lila stood. They were holding what I could only imagine were offerings. Chicken, cakes, foods of all types. I watched in terror while each church member who had brought food handed their offering to the preacher, who fed it to Lila. She stood there, eyes staring into an oblivion that did not exist, mindlessly chewing. Lila remained as still as a pillar. The only thing moving was her jaw. 
Attendees handed their respective foods to the Waffle House guy. A whole rotisserie chicken, a coffee cake, a raw head of cabbage, a plum, a turkey leg…There must have been fifteen people in line, roughly half of the congregation, all waiting to donate an item so their leader could feed it to Lila. Her jaws moved mechanically, gazing into the abyss. I watched in terror as The preacher seemed to relish in the act, using his fingers to delicately wipe leftovers from her lips and chin, depositing the crumbs back into her mouth. She sucked his fingers gently, so as not to discard a single crumb. 

I almost gagged at the sight, paralyzed. The preacher closed his eyes in bliss and let out soft moans while Lila continued to feed, licking his palms with an empty expression. I quickly looked over to Kaia, who was holding her phone at a meticulous angle. Thank God she was recording this. I didn’t know what to do. If we ran, we would draw far too much attention to ourselves. I was not sure why, but I had this strange sensation that we needed to keep playing along. Kaia felt it too.

As quickly as it happened, the feeding had ceased. People pushed back into their seats, and Lila did the same, her rounded face still adorned with that glassy appearance of complete idleness. The preacher walked to a basin sitting on one of the front-row chairs and rinsed his hands. He looked up to the expectant audience with a grin.

“Blessed this day. Now that our Mother has fed, it is our turn to break bread with one another.” 

Ruth, Nazarene, and Esther all stood up from the front row with wide smiles and began passing around communion trays. I looked to Kaia, who could read my face like tarot. The expression in her eye told me she was in it for more evidence. Leaving then would have been a distraction. So, we just kept playing their game. 
While churchgoers began to pass around plates, the preacher continued.
“Our God is mighty, and soon he will return, multiplying by way of flesh, delivering nonbelievers and sinners, casting them out of the darkness. As my son was once delivered from evil, you shall be too.” Waffle House Guy motioned to someone with a dark head of hair, who was sitting on the front row, but I couldn’t quite see. 

Ruth appeared, holding out a tray for me and Kaia. She stood there expectantly.

The communion wafer looked just like a regular cracker. Many people in the congregation broke pieces off to share, so Kaia and I followed suit. When the trays of communion wine came around, that’s when I got a particularly tense feeling in my throat. 

I brought the small cup to my lips, but it smelled strange. Unlike any wine or juice I had ever had. It smelled like rotten milk. I eyed Kaia, who had gotten her glass before me. She twitched her features as if to say not to drink it, but when I noticed the empty cup between her fingers, I didn’t want her to be the only one of us who did. Whatever was in that cup, we were drinking it together. 
While I quickly contemplated drinking the communion, bringing the cup close to my lips, the commitment to drinking it came over me in a strange wave of submission. I swallowed down the tablespoon of liquid, which smelled like a soured baby bottle. It was deep red, like wine, but the texture in my mouth felt like olive oil. When it went down my throat, it burned. Not like the sting of a shot of whiskey. This burned like fire ants. An allergic reaction. It burned like sun poisoning. The feeling was indescribable. 

The last thing I remembered was Kaia staring at me as if she had seen a ghost. In the last few seconds of consciousness, I caught a glimpse of a plastic water bottle on the floor near Kaia’s chair. Oily, purple liquid floating on top. My stomach sank. She had spit hers out. 

In the quickly fleeting light of my vision, taking in every last detail of Kaia’s face, I feared I would never see her again.
…

When I awoke, Kaia was sitting over me in my bed. My heart raced. It felt as if my soul had left my body and had been sucked back in. I became aware of everything around me

“Kaia!” I screamed, clutching the blankets. “What just happened?” Tears were welling up in my eyes. It felt like the most intense panic attack I had ever had. Kaia looked to me in confusion, her jaw practically hitting the floor with astonishment before she burst into a huge smile. She flung herself around me. I felt her tears on my shoulder, and I wrapped myself tightly around her. 

“Thank God you’re back,” she whispered to me. I had never known Kaia to cry over anything, yet here she was, sobbing in my arms.

“How long was I asleep?” I asked, running my fingers through her hair. 

She pulled back in disbelief.

“Asleep?” she asked, her face falling

“Jordan, you’ve been awake for days…completely silent…just staring into the distance, going through the motions.” She shuddered at the thought of her next few words. “…You were smiling the whole time.
*What? How was that possible?*

“What the actual *fuck* is wrong with you?” Kaia smacked my arm, tears in her eyes. She gave me another hug, “Why on earth would you drink that?” 

My mind was still hazy. It burned with the tinge of the stinging feeling I had experienced when I drank that stuff…Every memory was a blur until I fully focused on it. It felt like I had just woken up from R.E.M. sleep, and even though I was awake, I couldn’t stop myself from saying the wrong words. Eventually, the memories became easier to summon.

“I remember looking over and seeing that your cup was empty…I didn’t know why you drank it, but I didn’t want to be there alone. Plus, the cracker seemed to be fine…I don’t know. I was scared. I panicked. I only realized you had spit yours out after I drank mine. I remember having a feeling like I didn’t have a choice.”

“Yeah, well…” Kaia stood up and pulled the plastic bottle out of her bag. The strange solution still floated on top of the water inside. “I’m pissed that you’d think I’d do anything that stupid, but I’m so glad you’re back.” She sighed.

“What do you mean by ‘I’ve been awake this whole time?’” I attempted to rub a tension headache out of my temples in vain. Kaia shook her head. 

“After you drank, it was like a switch flipped. You became just kind of…passive. You listened to them sing…You stared ahead as the preacher finished his sermon…Everything. Smiling. Then afterwards, I just walked us back to the car and drove you home. You slept, ate, took care of yourself. Just silent and smiling. It was freaky…like the exact same trance we saw Lila in at the revival.”

“What day is it?” I asked, looking around for my cell phone in utter disbelief.

“Tuesday,” Kaia said grimly. “You’ve been out of it for two and a half days. I wanted to take you to the hospital, but Marcus told me if you tested positive for drugs that you could lose your swim scholarship. I thought that since Lila was under some kind of influence like that too when we saw her that it had to wear off eventually. So, I’ve just been here. Tripsitting you.”

 “Oh my god, I’m so sorry. I don’t know what came over me…I was just terrified.” My mind was racing. “Where is Marcus? Did you tell him what was going on?”

“Yeah, I caught him up to speed when we drove you home. He even picked you up some of these.” Kaia reached down and pulled out a sports recovery electrolyte drink. “Said that you’d need them.”

“Are they any good?” I took one from her hand and cracked it open. It was supposed to be a joke, I guess.

“I don’t know. You tell me.” Kaia grunted. “You’ve been drinking them left and right. You pretty much just ate anything we fed you.” 
My guts knotted up, sending whatever was in my stomach back up the wrong direction.“You don’t mean…” I started. Kaia cut me off.

“Yup. Just like Lila,” she said. Her voice was grateful but cold. 

I sat in astonishment. In horror.

“What do we do now? They drugged us. We could get a toxicology report of whatever is in that bottle.”

“I’m already ahead of you. I brought a little bit to the health department this morning. They said they’d have the full results back in three to five business days.” I sat back against the headboard and pulled the sheets away, noticing I was wearing…a diaper?

“What is this?” I asked, my voice dripping with mortification.

“What’s it look like?” Kaia teased, but then her voice went quiet. She replied, barely above a whisper, “Yeah…you pissed yourself a few times.”

“Kaia, I am so, so sorry…” I felt horrible. Tears were stinging my eye ducts. I was embarrassed, scared, and angry all at once. 

The molting face of the Waffle House guy, the preacher, flashed into my memory like a camera’s shutter.
“He’s using this stuff to brainwash people. That’s how he’s getting them. And the bald women who were there…There were more than just Esther. There’s something really, really bad going on.” My brain felt like Swiss cheese, all full of holes. Just then, a fuzzy reminder of the woman in the coffee house shirt jolted from the recesses of my head. 

“And the new recruits…they’re not random. The church picks them.”
I hopped up out of bed and grabbed the phone from the nightstand, opening it and turning the screen toward Kaia. I scrolled between two photos: the one of the altar from Lila’s room and the blurry photo of the woman at the revival, with the “Brewed Awakening” T-shirt.
“What are you showing me?” Kaia asked, contemplating the photos.

“The business card on the altar matches this woman’s shirt. I think they’re taking things from people with the intention of bringing them into the cult.” Adrenaline rushed through my fingertips like lightning. Kaia’s face crumpled into a stumped expression.

“Okay…Are you saying that Lila’s ritual brought us to the church? I don’t understand…”

“I don’t think it literally pulls you there, but I think it’s like a manifestation thing. I think they’re selecting people they think they can easily manipulate into joining, then making them drink that…stuff. Try to confuse them and get them to come back. It didn’t work because we both didn’t take communion.” Kaia’s eyes widened. Her face froze in fear as if she was a petrified tree

“Oh my god…When the meeting was dismissed, some of the members went back to their cars, but the ones who were in a trance—the ones who drank—were led deeper in by other members. They wandered back into the compound. To these little cabins—” I cut her off.

“Little cabins…Yeah, that’s because that church camp I told you I went to? With the perve director? It’s the same place. They’re running it on generators so that they can practice their freak religion off-grid.”

Kaia’s face fell. “What? Oh my god, that’s insane.” She was standing now too. “Okay, so what do we do? If we call the police now, before we have evidence that we were drugged, they’re only going to interrogate members of the church. It could put a huge target on our backs and slow us down.”

I thought for a moment. Somewhere, Lila was being drugged and forced to eat God knows what. Even if we had to wait for the toxicology report to come back, we still had enough evidence to get Lila’s parents involved. 
If we showed them what we had gathered, they would be able to do something to keep her from going to those cult meetings. I remembered how desperate they had sounded when Kaia and I visited last. They would go to any lengths to have their daughter back.

“There’s only one thing I know to do: show this stuff to Lila’s mom and dad,” I said softly. Kaia stiffened.

“Do you think that they will listen? Even after ignoring the weird culty stuff and being so oblivious to the tapeworm thing?”

“I think they will. They’ll do anything to get Lila back to the way she was before all of this,” I replied. Kaia nodded. 

“I just thought I could handle this without any intervention.” I sighed in a shaky breath. Kaia’s phone buzzed, disintegrating the heavy silence in the room. She quickly grabbed it, and her face relaxed when she read the caller ID.

“It’s Marcus,” she said, putting it on speaker. “Hey, what’s up?”

“You guys doing okay?” Marcus’s voice crackled through, tinged with fear. “Jordan come to yet?”

“Yeah, I’m here Marcus!” I said.

“Oh thank God. What the hell happened?” I leaned closer to the phone, my voice hoarse.

“I’m…I’m awake now. It was bad, Marcus. I mean, you guys know way more than me.” I took a shaky inhale. “That shit I drank was drugged. We think that’s how they’re abducting members. Lila’s in deep, and we’re freaking out.”

“Shit,” he muttered. “What’s our next move?”

Kaia and I exchanged a glance. Her eyes reflected the same mix of fear and determination I felt in the pit of my stomach.

“We are going to try and sit down with her mom and dad,” she said, “but we need to figure out exactly what to tell them. We’ve got evidence, but it’s all messy. Can we come to your place? We need to talk this through somewhere they don’t expect.

“Bet,” Marcus said, tears in his voice. “My house, ASAP. I’ll order some food, and we’ll sort this out. You good to drive, Kai?” 

Kaia nodded, even though he couldn’t see her. “You’re pretty close to the school, best I remember?” Kaia asked, checking her watch.

“Nah…Yeah, I’m like seventeen minutes away. I just put it in the GPS to be sure.

“Send me the address. We’ll be there soon. Thank you, Marcus.”

“No, thank you, guys. I just want my girl back. I don’t even care if she’s with me or not by the end of this. I just need to know she’s okay.”

“That’s what we—” I looked at Kaia. “That’s what I want too.” Kaia nodded. 

“Me too. I really care about you guys.” She eventually hung up and began scurrying around the room, darting in and out of her bedroom and mine.

“What are you doing?” I asked before rubbing my head. “Sorry, I’m still kind of messed up…”

Kaia burst back into the room with some of my basics: a T-shirt, a pair of jeans, tennis shoes, socks, and a pair of my pajamas and underwear. She packed them into her bag, along with the mysterious water bottle, her gun, and her phone.

“We don’t know what’s coming. If we need to bug out, this could be our chance.” She shoved a few more electrolyte drinks into the duffle.
I pulled on a jacket over my T-shirt and continued to get ready. I found some running shorts to put on—at the embarrassment of removing my diaper— and my hands trembled while I tied my shoes. After grabbing some snack bars and protein shakes I had stored under my bed, I handed Kaia the evidence folder.

“Don’t forget this,” I said, trying to sound braver than I felt. Kaia’s eyes bugged.

“I can’t believe I almost forgot that.” She strapped the duffel to her back like a backpack. We headed for the door, but Kaia stopped short, her hand on the knob. We stood there for what felt like an eternity, the air tightening with tension. Something had to have happened to Kaia, the way she just froze. Eventually, I broke the silence.

“Kaia?” I said lowly.

“Wait,” she whispered, her voice taut like the string between two telephone cups. She crept to the window and peeled back the curtain just enough to peek into the parking lot below. Her breath hiccupped in her chest, and she motioned for me to join her.
I pressed against the wall, heart pounding, and looked outside. It took me a moment to adjust to the harsh light of the parking lot, but eventually, I saw what she had seen. There, under our breezeway, stood Ruth, Nazarene, and Esther, their eyes fixed on the entrance to my dorm. My heart jumped, not just from seeing them. Now Ruth also was shaved bald. 

In the distance, Kaia’s car was parked across the lot, a good thirty yards away. We would never make it past them.

“They’re waiting for us?” I whispered, my mouth dry with uncertainty. 
Kaia’s cheeks were pale, but her eyes were piercing.

“Doesn’t matter. We can’t go out the front. They’ll see us,” Kaia whispered, edging away from the window, even though the curtains were drawn. 

 “So, what do we do?” I glanced around the room, my pulse thundering like a horse on a track.

“The back window,” Kaia said, pointing to the one in my room behind my bed. “It’s ground level, and there’s bushes for cover. We can sneak to the lot. We’ll circle the building longways and pop out behind them. Hopefully, that will buy us enough time to get to the car before they do.”

I nodded, but I felt the dryness in my eyes. They were wide open in fear. “Okay, but we gotta move fast.” We grabbed the last of our things, climbed onto my bed, and pushed the window open. The cool evening breeze bit my face like a warning. The bushes outside rustled faintly, and I froze, half-expecting one of those women to crawl out and lunge at me. I had a horrible premonition of Esther pouncing out on all fours and sinking her fingernails into my leg while it dangled over the windowsill, pulling me deep into the bushes.
It was nothing. Just the wind. The bushes outside were boxwoods, thick and roughly three feet tall, and they lined the back and sides of the dorm. As long as we kept between them and the building, the women wouldn’t be able to hear or see us until we got really close…unless they got the same idea.
Kaia, sensing my fear, maneuvered around me, giving me a quick side hug, as if to say, *“Everything will be okay.”* I watched her slide through the window, dropping into the bushes with a soft thud about four feet below. I followed suit. My T-shirt caught on the frame, the fabric tearing with a loud rip that made my heart stop. We crouched low, the scratchy leaves pressing against us, our breaths shallow and ragged. I reached up to the half-closed window and quietly slid it shut. 

The parking lot was just around the corner, but I knew the women were still there, guarding our apartment front door like sphinxes watching over some great Egyptian tomb. Step by silent step, we crept forward, staying low, the mulch crunching softly under our shoes. Every sound we made, whether it was the brush of a limb or a scuff against the brick wall, felt like an endless scream in the silence. We were halfway to the lot when a sharp, metallic clang echoed from the dorm building—

*A fire alarm.*

It bellowed like a bell toll of imminent death, thunderous and shrill enough to surely wake the dead from their subterranean sleep. Voices shouted from inside, and students started spilling out the front entrances. Every apartment was emptying into the parking lot at once.

“Shit,” Kaia hissed, grabbing my arm. “They could be flushing us out. They’re gonna be in the lot, waiting for us.”

“How? How would they have tripped an alarm?”

“It doesn’t matter. Even if it is a coincidence, we have to go.” Kaia yanked my arm.
Panic surged through me, and my legs trembled, fighting the urge to bolt. We continued to creep around the building toward the madness. We peered around the front corner of our dorm. Down the way, the women hadn’t moved, but they were turning their heads, scanning the crowd of students pouring into the lot. If they realized it was taking too long for us to respond to the drill, it would only be a matter of seconds before they started toward the back of the building to look for us. We were still hidden, but the bushes wouldn’t cover us for long. 
But despite their efforts to stalk us, they hadn’t thought to wait by our car.

“Go, go, go,” I whispered, shoving Kaia toward the lot. We scrambled, out from the bushes, something snagging my now torn t-shirt, our hands scraping against the dirt, before bulleting onto the blacktop. The alarm wailed behind us, a relentless pulse matching the cadence of my racing heart. Kaia’s car was just a few yards away. 

Not unlike Orpheus, or maybe Lot’s wife, I knew better than to look behind us while we ran, but it did not stop me. I caught a glimpse of Esther, her wild, tortured eyes locking onto the hiding spot where we had been seconds before. Even in the moment I caught a glimpse of, her motions were mechanical and animalistic, like a missile locking on a moving target. The other two women followed her, all rushing toward the boxwood bushes. 

That had been close. I grabbed Kaia’s hand, my voice barely a wheeze. “Run, Kaia. They’re headed the other way-” We sprinted on, weaving between parked cars and bumbling apartment residents. The alarm screamed, and the crowd seemed to grow thicker. We finally reached the car.

Kaia fumbled with her keys, unlocking the vehicle with a beep that felt deafening. She dove inside, unlocking my passenger side door. I heard something near my feet…then felt it pierce into me with a pain I can’t describe.

A young twink with pink/purple hair and lip piercings (because of course) comes inside sees me and immediately goes: This is my seat I have a reservation!

No hello, no excuse me, as if he knows me from the previous day.

I asked him you have reserved this seat in this part of the train? Seat #16?

He goes no 15. To which I replied well then this isn't 15, I don't know maybe it's the one the lady next to me is sitting on. He then asked her: What's your seat?

Then it turned out 15 was the one right behind me. Then he goes: Oops I made a mistake sorry. Then I said it's alright mistakes can happen.

And I am right mistakes can happen, maybe he had a long day travelling I don't know neither do I care, it's not alright demanding your rights without first making sure you are not wrong beforehand.

We happened to get off at the same station and he was walking with his nose so high up it was very annoying just seeing him (because I know what his attitude is). Well at least he was willing to admit his error.

So dear annoying twinks, make sure to be polite, always say excuse me, thank you and I apologize and maybe people inside and outside the gay community, might tolerate you more.

I just moved to Toronto recently and figured I’d try my luck here instead of just hoping I bump into my future favourite person on the TTC.

A bit about me:
	•	23, new grad, moved here from out of province, working in engineering
	•	5’6”, Southeast Asian, Liberal
	•	I love: cozy nights in, long walks while talking about anything and everything, trying new food spots, bookstores, museums, and wandering around random neighbourhoods just to see what’s there
	•	Big fan of biking/ creative writing/ nerdy chats, but I’m just as happy people-watching over coffee

What I’m looking for:
	•	Someone in their 20s/early 30s who’s kind, emotionally mature, and actually interested in getting to know each other
	•	Open to something that starts chill (coffee, a walk, grabbing food) and can grow into a proper relationship if we click

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message with:
	•	Your age and a bit about yourself (we can exchange photos through DMs as I think physical attraction should be mutual)
	•	What you like and hobbies
	•	Your favorite Toronto spot

Let’s see if we click and maybe plan a coffee or a low-pressure first hang sometime soon ☺️",1,1764533884.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False
1pas9d3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pas9d3,Staging my studio redesign in The Sims 4,"I’ve been in my tiny studio for 4 years and am finally ready to tackle the redesign I’ve always wanted. I made a mock-up in The Sims 4, which helped a bit, but I’m still stuck—so I turn to Reddit.

Goals
	•	Add more living-room seating
	•	Remove the never-used window table
	•	Add bookshelves
	•	Move the desk out of the entryway

Questions
	•	What seating works in the window nook? I’d love a faux built-in window seat, but the couch placement makes it tricky. Even a loveseat looks off, and I can’t find a style/color that fits the room.
	•	I need a desk chair that can double as extra living-room seating. I like the Rhea Swivel Lounge Chair from Urban, but not sure any of the colors work.
	•	Does switching from a hallway runner to a bedroom rug help or worsen the layout’s choppiness?
	•	Bedding: nothing looks right. Maybe the green rug is wrong?
	•	The “Future” entryway feels cold.
	•	Bathroom: the cold/modern tile and counters are the opposite of my style, and I’m not sure where to start.

Notes
	•	It’s a rental: no painting, no new cabinets, no demo.
	•	I’d like to keep the couch, bed frame, coffee table, and TV stand. Most other items could be replaced.
	•	Last pic shows my general style—trying to avoid adding more modern or MCM pieces.

I would love any feedback — even stuff I didn’t specifically ask about!

*Being trans, people-pleasing, and defining a new name*

First person I heard use my name was the cashier at the Williamsburg Taco Bell, handing me the thanksgiving dinner that I ate alone amongst the chosen family of Uber drivers taking their break in silence.

I wanted to test it, see what it would be like to hear someone say that name aloud. Why I would choose a name that a good amount of people can’t pronounce (He was close, he handed me my order yelling “Sire!” A feast for a king), was my first thought. I’ve spent most of my life trying to take up as little space as possible, and now having to constantly advocate for the pronunciation of my new name every time I interact with someone seemed daunting. 

Everything is very black-and-white in the worlds that I’ve occupied. Man or Woman. Hot or Ugly. Good or Bad. Simple or Difficult. As I have taken on (or really, unintentionally assumed) the role of leader in my work life, I’ve tried as much as possible to be perceived as a “Good” and “Simple” person to make others happy (and make my life easier, really). I haven’t always been good. I’ve made mistakes, hurt people, learned lessons too late, etc. And I’m probably “difficult” sometimes (And I mean shit even when I’m not trying to be “difficult,” my autism, Blackness, or some secret third thing makes me perceived as such). But in a world lacking any nuance, I’ve strived towards the path of least resistance — I’m the good guy. I’m a normal, easy-to-work-with person that can sit in the good, wholesome, productive leader box. Until I’m not, then I’m ripped apart, externally and internally, till I can figure out how to get back in my box. 

I think that’s one of the many reasons I like to keep my gender simple and uncomplicated. Taking the path of least resistance. I got the “girl” label and there’s no need to make things troublesome for me or anyone else to change it. Change my email address, websites, organization paperwork, re-introduce myself to professional connections, and more things I haven’t even begun to think of? A headache. Come out to my family in the south? As Trans, AND gay? Hilarious. I’ve got other things to worry about. And it’s not even that uncomfortable. Barely even think about it most days. Gender? That’s other people’s business. I just wear the clothes I got from my mom that I still have from high-school, the random floral Buc-ee’s shirt I got as a gift, the James Blake t-shirts I’ve almost disintegrated from an unknown number of washes, the crop-tops and booty-shorts from that one old white dude I dated (free clothes, how can I complain?). I sport the face I was born with. She/Her? Like half the people I know use those pronouns. It’s very simple, really.

Recently though, I realized it might not be best to revolve my life around people pleasing. Through some meditation, through books, through writing, I’ve found myself faced with unbearable confusion and anxiety in my journey of self-discovery. Why I can stand on a stage in-front of a hundred or so people and yap about work just fine, but lapped around the block 5 times trying to enter a gay bar before giving up, is beyond me (Where did I go after giving up? You guessed it, to the Taco Bell). There’s something indescribably terrifying exiting out of the box of normalcy, conformity, and the routine of being the good, simple, non-intrusive person.

\_\_\_\_

I remember in middle school being afraid to walk in this specific area in the hallway during passing period, because they had these full size mirrors I could see my reflection in. I assumed the unbearable discomfort it brought was because I was “ugly.” And that reminder was depressing, so I avoided it. For a multitude of reasons (Being in predominantly white spaces, not knowing how to do my hair, being undiagnosed Autistic, puberty, being taller than literally everyone including teachers, and so on), I was uncomfortable in my body and being perceived by other people. I assumed “ugly and awkward” as my diagnosis and as the reasoning for my later realized gender and neurotype discomforts.

It was in high-school, when I found my first set of older boyfriends I met online through Minecraft, that I learned that I had something that was desired: femininity. I spent many years attaching my value to the aspects of “womanhood” that were desired by others. My only close relationships were boyfriends, and I was only valued as someone’s “girlfriend.” I wasn’t ugly anymore, and I could get used to what was in the mirror. It couldn’t be that bad? I had something to be happy about, apparently. 

I’m not sure when I first entertained the idea of being trans. I have on a hard-drive somewhere pictures of me in a button up, jeans, and wearing 2 sports bras, sometime in undergrad, just to see what it would feel like to look like that. I remember thinking I looked so ridiculous. I think it’s because those clothes didn’t fit, I could still very clearly see my feminine figure in those skinny jeans, and I had (have) horrendous selfie game. 

I thought about being trans in middle school and high school as well. It’s been on and off throughout much of my post-pubescent life. I remember contemplating and eventually brushing off those thoughts because “I only wanted to be a guy because of trauma,” or something. I hated being perceived as feminine by men, and I hated all the objectification that comes from that. I hated not being able to be friends with and love men without them sexualizing that. And I didn’t want to change gender based on all the societal things that are put on women. I didn’t think that’s why \*actual\* trans people transition.

But I also hate feeling weird around women, feeling like the odd one out. I’ve always wanted to be friends with women, but I’ve felt like an intruder in any group of women I’m in, and I didn’t really have a label for it and didn’t want to explore that embarrassing “I’m not like other girls” feeling. I hate women’s clothes, and I hated feeling weird in the men’s clothing section in Texas, prepping the “I’m shopping for my friend” line I had stashed in case someone asks. I hate my round face in the mirror. I hate having an objectively “good” singing voice, but still hating how it sounded.

I loved the idea of being friends with and having loving relationships with other women as a man. And I loved the thought of being a man loving other men. Not romantic love; I like the idea of being a warm, friendly presence. I feel like “me” on the outside isn’t emanating the “me” on the inside that wants to be that presence with other people. The idea of exploring who I am from a different body — not reserved, unabashedly me, exploring masculinity and even femininity from a “male” slate —made me feel like I could finally not be terrified trying to be seen around people. And I started to shed the ideas of what \*actual\* trans people do and come up with my own reasons for doing.

And I hated my old name. Too feminine sounding. Never liked it. I went by a masc nickname to all my online friends growing up. And now, I loved the thought of finally getting a new name. 

\_\_\_\_

“I can’t do another white name” was my first thought (my birth name is, very white, even though neither parent is). I landed on Trevon. Played with that for a bit. Felt too much like a “name” though. Not sure how to describe that feeling, but that “that’s a name other people have” feeling. I’ve known at least a couple “Trevons/Treys.” I’m not sure if I’m a Trey, too. I was on the phone with my ex, the first person I came out to, as we browsed the list of baby names we would never have (tragic). I played with some names I came across, names I liked the sound of, creating hybrid names (Is that allowed, I thought?). After some playing around in a notes app the day after at some coffee shop on the UES, arrived on Sy’Aire.

Don’t think I’ve ever known anyone with that name, after some Google searches I found it on other baby-name sites, even a ""how to pronounce” YouTube video of its own. It felt very new, “airy”, freeing. I like writing it “syaire” but the capitalization and apostrophe I felt might make it easier to pronounce (I was wrong). Doesn’t have a meaning according to Google. No origin other than being a combination or alternative to other related names. Did I need an origin story? I didn’t know the meaning of my birth name until I Googled it just now actually. Could I create my own meaning? Again… is this allowed?? I panicked as if the name police would come and force me to pick Steve or Kyle or something (and apologies to the Steve and Kyle’s of the world, or anyone else with popular male names, it’s not you, it’s me).

For the next few weeks after, I was “Sy’Aire” in my head. In the Tinder profile I kept impulsively creating and deleting. In my Taco Bell orders. 

New clothes were easy. Fun, even. I never liked femme clothing. Baggy clothes, neutral colors, that felt like me. Big t-shirts, undershirts, great. Boxers? Not there yet, and honestly panties (And let’s pause to say I never liked that word, ever. We need a new gender neutral or just less freaky word for those things. “Panties” for me is my “moist,” I just hate it.) work just fine.

Pronouns were another thing. He/They feels good enough for now. It’s really hard to tell what I want here. Again, I feel like this is an “other people” thing. I’m realizing the discomfort I’ve gotten in the past from accidentally being Sir’d or He'd (I’m abnormally tall, it’s a common mistake until people see my face) is mostly because then they see my face, they do the “Oh! Uh… Ma’am? Sorry,” and it’s awkward and I feel uncomfortable because they’re uncomfortable. “She” honestly feels fine, but if I’m going for \*boy\* then maybe we should retire that one. “He” is a little jarring (I think mostly due to that “oops this is about to be awkward” realization) but maybe I’ll get used to it. “They” is fine but it feels a bit impersonal. And I honestly don’t trust myself at the moment to stick to any neo-pronouns (I keep accidentally mis-pronouning myself and have deadnamed myself like 4 times today).

Female to what, though? Still unsure. Male seems fine. I’m trying to go beyond “fine” though. Fine shouldn’t be my standard anymore. I should probably at least attempt to figure out these things about myself. Still trying to get there though. Still trying to figure out a lot of things actually. Had to phone my cis ex again, to figure out the name of those pants that I like that I see guys wear. “Chinos,” apparently. Not knowing how to dress myself or the names of clothing items I like is apparently, very male. 

Anyways, it’s sigh-AIR. Same amount of syllables as my last name, actually. Really it’s not that hard. And I would like to create my own definition(s) for this name:

sy·​aire
