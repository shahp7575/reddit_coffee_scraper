# Primo Espresso: Find the Best Beans in 2025

The quest for the perfect espresso begins and ends with the beans. primo espresso beans represent the pinnacle of coffee quality, carefully selected and roasted to deliver an unparalleled flavor experience. in 2025, the market is saturated with options, making the selection process challenging. This article provides an in-depth review of what constitutes primo espresso beans, highlighting key features, benefits, and ultimately guiding you to find the best beans for your espresso needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of primo espresso begins with carefully considered characteristics.

**Origin and Terroir:** The origin of the coffee beans plays a crucial role in dictating their flavor profile. Beans from renowned coffee regions like Ethiopia, Colombia, and Sumatra offer distinct characteristics due to variations in climate, altitude, and soil composition. Ethiopian Yirgacheffe beans, for example, are known for their radiant acidity and floral notes, while Sumatran Mandheling beans possess earthy and full-bodied flavors.Understanding the terroir,the complete natural habitat in which a particular coffee is produced,is crucial in predicting the cup quality.

**Bean Variety and processing Method:** Arabica beans are generally preferred for espresso due to their inherent sweetness, acidity, and complex flavors compared to Robusta beans. However, certain Robusta varieties, when carefully cultivated and processed, can contribute to a rich crema and a bolder flavor profile in espresso blends. The processing method, such as washed, natural, or honey processed considerably impacts the bean's flavor. Washed beans are characterized by their clean acidity and bright flavors, while natural processed beans exhibit fruitier and more complex profiles.

**Roast Profile:** The roast profile is a critical aspect of espresso bean quality. A skilled roaster can bring out the inherent flavors of the green beans while avoiding undesirable characteristics like bitterness or burnt flavors. Espresso beans typically require a medium-to-dark roast to develop the right balance of sweetness, acidity, and body. A well-developed roast ensures optimal extraction and a rich, flavorful espresso shot.

**Freshness and Storage:** Freshness is paramount when it comes to espresso beans. Coffee beans begin to lose their aroma and flavor within weeks of roasting. Look for beans that are recently roasted, ideally within two weeks, and packaged in airtight containers with one-way valves to allow carbon dioxide to escape without allowing oxygen to enter. Proper storage in a cool, dark, and dry place is essential to preserve their freshness and flavor.

**Bean Density and Consistency:** Bean density affects the grind size required for proper extraction. Denser beans require a finer grind. Bean consistency, or the uniformity of size and shape, is important for even extraction across the grounds during brewing. Uneven bean sizes can result in some grounds being over-extracted while others are under-extracted, impacting the overall flavor profile of the espresso.

**Certifications:** Certifications such as fair Trade, Organic, and Rainforest Alliance ensure that the beans were produced in an ethical and sustainable manner.These certifications address important social and environmental concerns, providing consumers with the assurance that their coffee purchase supports responsible farming practices. These certifications don't automatically equate to premium quality, but they can serve as an critically important criterion for discerning consumers.## Core Benefits

Primo espresso beans deliver a superior coffee experience through several key benefits.

**Extraordinary Flavor:** Superior espresso beans offer a complex and nuanced flavor profile. Depending on the origin,variety,and roast,you can expect to taste a wide range of flavors,including chocolate,caramel,nuts,fruits,and flowers. This depth of flavor makes each espresso shot a unique and satisfying experience.

**Rich Crema:** A hallmark of well-extracted espresso is a thick, velvety crema. Primo espresso beans, when properly ground and brewed, produce a crema that is rich in color, texture, and flavor. The crema enhances the overall mouthfeel of the espresso and contributes to its visual appeal.

**Balanced Acidity:** High-quality espresso beans contribute to a bright and balanced acidity in the cup. Acidity adds a refreshing and vibrant quality to the espresso, preventing it from tasting flat or dull. The right level of acidity complements the sweetness and bitterness, creating a harmonious flavor profile.

**Satisfying Aroma:** The aroma of freshly brewed espresso made from premium beans is intoxicating. The rich and complex aroma stimulates the senses and enhances the anticipation of the first sip. The aroma is frequently enough a good indicator of the flavor you can expect.

**Enhanced Body:** Good espresso beans contribute to a full and satisfying body in the espresso. The body refers to the weight and texture of the espresso in the mouth. A full-bodied espresso feels rich and ample, providing a more satisfying and complete coffee experience.

## FAQs Section

**What is the difference between espresso beans and regular coffee beans?**
Espresso beans are simply coffee beans that have been roasted to a level that is ideal for espresso brewing. While any roasted coffee bean can technically be used to make espresso, beans labeled as ""espresso beans"" are typically roasted darker and have been selected to produce the best flavor when brewed under pressure.What truly matters is not the label but the roast level, bean quality and the freshness of the beans.

**Can I use pre-ground coffee for espresso?**
While it is possible to use pre-ground coffee for espresso, it is not recommended. Pre-ground coffee loses its freshness and flavor much faster than whole beans. Additionally,it is difficult to control grind size of pre-ground coffee. As a very fine and consistent grind is required for optimal espresso extraction, pre-ground coffee will likely result in a weak or bitter espresso.**How do I store espresso beans properly?**
Espresso beans should be stored in an airtight container, away from light, heat, and moisture. A dark, cool pantry is ideal. Avoid storing beans in the refrigerator or freezer, as temperature fluctuations can cause condensation and damage the beans. Ideally, buy beans in smaller quantities to ensure you are always using fresh coffee.**How do I know if my espresso beans are stale?**
Stale espresso beans will lack aroma and flavor. They may also appear dry and brittle. Once ground you may notice that the coffee grounds don't clump together well and the resulting espresso will be weak and lack crema. The best way to tell is to brew a shot and taste it; if it tastes flat or bitter, the beans are likely stale.

1m4hpw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m4hpw3/i_m37_cant_tell_if_i_love_my_f31_gf_and_if_im/,I [M37] can’t tell if I love my [F31] GF and if I’m ready for marriage,"I'm having trouble deciding whether to continue my relationship with my girlfriend. We've been going out for four months. We met on some dating app. She said she loved me some days ago, and I just went quiet. The next day we were together, and I was just quiet in bed, not talking, and we both knew something was wrong. Today I visited her for a little bit, and she asked for my answer, and I just said a lot of words that didn't mean anything, and I told her that I couldn't tell how I was feeling. Part of me thinks that because I couldn't just say, I love you too, maybe it's all just a big wash. And that's where I'm having trouble, because when I was a kid, I thought, oh, I need to fall head over heels with the person I'm going to love back and, you know, marry, marriage and have kids with, because I want to have a family. She wants to have kids too. I don't think as much as me, but she does want to have kids. I keep going over all of the reasons why I should marry her or, you know, say I love her back. It's just, I don't want to say that I love her if I don't love her and I can't tell how I feel, and I feel like if I'm to say that I love her, then that implies that I would marry her, because I am 3x years old and she's 3x-5, >29. So I feel like now is the time to be serious about relationships. 

There are so many things about her that I like. She's smarter than me, which is super hot. She's into the same music as me. She likes dumb memes. Not the same ones as me, but adjacent. We both don't like dogs. She has a not-dog that I... ...don't like. Because it bites the shit out of anyone that touches it. I guess... Something she told me when we first started going out was, “Thank God you have a big dick. I didn't want to have to... ...break it off”. And ever since she said that, it made me wonder, Does she like me for me, or does she just like me because I check boxes and... ...have a big dick, which is a box to check. We laugh at a lot of the same jokes. We have a similar sense of humor. We took a road trip together and had a great time together. We were definitely on the same wavelength. And wanted to do a lot of similar things. She never pays for anything. I pay for basically everything. I feel like I could count on one hand the number of times she's paid for something, whereas I've probably put thousands of dollars into dates and things at this point. I feel like I come up with the vast majority of the dates and plans and activities, but she does come up with a thing or two now and then. I love that she thinks I'm sexy, and says things that make me feel attractive, and that's what I like about her. And says things that make me feel attractive, and like she really wants me. I really like that about her. She makes me feel desirable. I think she's pretty, but one of my major hang-ups is... I don't want to be with someone who's overweight, and she's overweight. She weighs more than me, and she's shorter than me. She's got good genetics for it. It looks good on her figure. But it bothers me. I can't throw her around in bed like I like to. I feel like... I've gained weight since we started going out. I gained a little bit of weight, too, but it's not... It's probably half as much, I'd say. It's hard to quantify. I still fit into the same clothing, barely. I had to... I had to do things less than I was doing all the time to make room for the relationship.



I think I'm definitely afraid of commitment. My history of relationships feels like a string of bad events. My college girlfriend cheated on me and I found out in the worst way. I witnessed, almost witnessed it, it was by phone, telephone, heard the other guy, it was bad. I dated her for five years and then I didn't, I didn't have any kind of romantic endeavor for five years after, I was just hating women for a while, a low-key misogynist, although I didn't know it. It took me a long time to recover from that. And then ever since then, it's been like three-quarters relationships where I'm just spinning my wheels, one-quarter relationships, or probably less than that, where I'm head over heels for the person. And every time I'm ever head over heels for the person, they are the ones that end up breaking up with me or breaking my heart. And then all the other relationships, like three-quarters, four-fifths of the time, I'm the one who ends up breaking their heart. I had a glow-up a few years ago and I just started going crazy, having as much sex as I could. I was often seeing two women at once, there were a few times where I was seeing three women at once. And I didn't tell them about each other, although I never told any of them that I loved them or that I was serious or monogamous. And I never told any of them that I was only seeing them, basically lying through omission, white lies.

It got really bad last year. It was the worst in my life. I'd gotten buff and confident. And I was all over the place, experimenting. A lot of culture says that's what I'm supposed to do. But... I did some bad things. And... I've cheated. Maybe a lot. And I don't want to marry somebody if I think I'm going to cheat on them. And I'm afraid that if I... If I stay with this person, there's a chance that I will. But these are all things that I am theoretically in control of. I'm the one who controls whether I cheat or not. I just wish that my partner would... lose a little bit of weight. If she had instead lost the same amount of weight that she gained, I think I would be all in. Like, just all in. The other things I don't like are that we don't agree politically. I'm more of like a X type. More of like a X. She's more of a... Y. And she’ll just straight up say that some of my opinions or beliefs are wrong and bad. We don't get into it because... it's common knowledge not to fight over these things. But it's a little uncomfortable... knowing that we have these fundamental belief differences. And then I just wish she would be a little more feminine. I mean, she doesn't shave her legs. Or armpits. She's got random hairs in places I didn't even know women could have hair. And I've had... I've been with a lot of women. I mean, I'm not counting here. I've never sat down and taken a count. But it's probably close to two dozen. Which... maybe a lot of people say that's nothing, but... I feel like for me... is it even a thing where you can say that it's a good or bad amount? I mean, this is such a question of perspective and morality. It's hard to say. But my point is that... I've been with a lot of women. Every race... or ethnicity or... nationality... No, not nationality. That's not true. But I've been around. I forget what I'm talking about. I came back during the editing pass period. Yes, I remember what I was trying to get to, period. The point is that this has to be some of the least hot sex that I've had consistently. Probably the hottest thing about it is that she wants to have it with me.

She has to be one of the least feminine, most likely-to-be-voted lesbian women that I've ever been with. I mean, she dresses like a lesbian. She acts like a lesbian sometimes. I know some extremely butch lesbians, and she has a lot in common with them. And I know that I'm the type that those type of women like to go for. I'm more emotional. I like more sweet things as opposed to whatever your typical stereotypical man likes. I've never had a sense of bravado for myself. I want to marry someone and have a family, and I want to be there for them through thick and thin. And I don't trust myself or I don't know if I trust myself to be there for her. For example, if she puts on more weight, it's already really pushing it for me. I won't go down on a girl unless I'm really in love with them. And they absolutely have to be skinny enough that I want to go down on them. And I can't tell if I love my girlfriend because I will not go down on her. She's too big. It's just gross to me. Not too gross. Going down is. And I'll have sex with her. But I don't even want to have sex most of the time with her. And I'm not sure if my testosterone levels are dropping because I'm middle-aged. So maybe that's just normal. I mean, I think they say it's normal that your dick doesn't work as good the older you get. So it could be that. But with my other girls previously, I would go back-to-back with them. I would sometimes three times in an hour or whatever because I take care of my body. But with my girlfriend, I don't want to. Like, I mostly... A lot more of sex with her, for me, is to please her and make her happy. That's how I feel about it. And there's times when, yeah, I'm horny and I want to have sex with her. But I would say the majority of the time, the large majority of the time, I'm having sex with her to make her happy. This is really tough.

And I think about her, and she's so smart. I love that she understands things that I want to talk about at a higher level than most people I know because, again, she's so educated and smart. And we have similar senses of humor. I like cuddling with her. I like taking her out on dates. Sometimes we'll do a little weed. Very rarely, honestly. I mean, she'll do weed probably a lot on her own, but when we're together, almost never. And I'll pretty much never smoke weed or do any kind of weed. Maybe I'll take a little edible sometimes, have some fun when I'm around her. It's rare. Like once a month, maybe. This is tough. I feel like she checks a bunch of boxes that I'm looking for in an ideal partner. And that's why I want to say that I do love her. But at the same time, I feel like there's not like a sexual spark. And she's attractive enough that I have sex with her, mostly to make her happy. But I guess if I was to empathize, wouldn't I want someone that loves me and has a spark? But they say that there's arranged marriages and you learn to love people and the passion fades, the hormones fade. That the whole idea of, “the one”, isn't real. The practicality of a marriage sounds good. Well, you know, saying I love her back, because that's what it eventually would lead to. I don't think there's very many things I would need to change about my current lifestyle to make her happy. I don't know. It's like, do most people that have successful, long-term, happy marriages have a lovey-dovey, magical romance about them? You know, up until they get married, at least. Hopefully afterwards, too. Because they say love and relationships are something you work at all the time. And I could see myself working at a relationship with this woman. If I'm being really honest, I worry that part of me thinks that maybe this is just as good as it gets. And she's a real catch for someone like me. And this is as good as I can do. Again, she checks a ton of boxes. But I just feel like that some kind of spark is just missing that would make me want to commit everything and step in front of a bullet, things like that. Well, maybe that's rash to say. I just can't tell how I feel. I don't want to break up with her. I also don't want to waste her time. I can't tell if I say I love her back and eventually we get married, if we will be happy. If she lost weight, tried to present herself as a little more feminine, and didn't chastise some of my personal beliefs, that would help a lot. I don't know. Is that fair? Well, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well... It's hard to say. 

And if it wasn't clear, the last few years of my life, from a Christian perspective, I cheated basically, because even if I didn't tell these women that I was monogamous with them, and even if I didn't tell these women that they were the only ones I was seeing, I wasn't upfront about it either. I would just never broach the subject. And in any case, I even took part in an extramarital affair with somebody else's wife for over a year. It was very bad. When we first met, I didn't know that she had a husband. But before we had sex, after we'd seen each other a few times, she told me that she did have one and asked me if it was okay. And I said yes. And there was a lot of stuff going on between her and I for a long time. Like I said, over a year. She told me that ever since her first boyfriend, which was in college for her, she is a few years older than me, she told me that she was never able to get really close to somebody. And I never asked, but I know that I wasn't the first guy that she had been with since her marriage. But for over a year, I was the guy. She was pregnant. When we started seeing each other, she was not pregnant, then she got pregnant. And yeah, the whole time, and the whole time I was seeing other girls, again, I didn't tell any of them that I was monogamous with them. And at the time, I didn't feel bad about it. Because I thought, oh, he must treat her bad from the story she told me. But that's the thing, I only heard those stories. I never heard his side of the story. And towards the end of it all, I started feeling guilty and bad about it. I told a friend or two, and the first friend said that it was bad, but that she had done the same thing. She had fucked some married guy, maybe multiple, I don't remember, but at least one. He wanted to leave his wife for my friend. She told me, you know, never do it, don't have sex with someone who's married, you know, that's, I mean, cheating, I mean, don't do it is what she said, don't facilitate that, etc. She said that's like her sin to live with, now it's like my sin to live with. I ended up telling another friend, that was a huge mistake, because he never looked at me the same. I regret telling him and I regret doing it. And I wish I had the morality or the wisdom to have never done it in the first place. And I feel like, I just feel like all the women that I've been with, and especially that experience has just turned me into some kind of degenerate with no morals.

And it's not like I ever set out to be a degenerate with no morals. I just, I never got attention from women like I wanted in my younger years. And then when I finally had my glow up in the last few years, suddenly everyone in my life, and people not in my life, which is like everyone was treating me nicer, girls were actually interested in me, although still not as interested in me as they are in like dudes who just have it. Guys, if you know, you know what I'm talking about. But still, you know, light years ahead of what it was before. And, uh, you know, I wasn't tempered over years. I, and when I was a, my college girlfriend, I wanted to marry her. And then I found out she was cheating on me the whole time and it just broke me inside. And I feel like just, I, I have a hard time telling how I can feel, how I feel most of the time in general about most things. But looking back on my actions and looking back on my history, I feel like it's, I have evidence to say that I've been broken ever since. Honestly, even before she cheated on me, I, I basically cheated on her. In college, I had this friend come out and we put our hands in each other's pants and made out. There was another girl I got in bed with her. We didn't have sex, but I got in bed with her and I was, I made out with her once at a party. 

My point is, I don't know, I don't know when my first act of infidelity was. Probably early college. And I think I just didn't develop a full range of emotions until my mid-30s, which is really fucked up. I've never been to a therapist or a psychiatrist or a psychologist or anything like that. I'm sure there's problems with me. I know I have things about me that most people in my life don't. Things that get in my way. I don't like it, but it is how it is. I've had to work so hard to develop a sense of empathy. I was never a psychopath or a sociopath or anything like that. Stringing a woman on without the intent to marry them, but when they are in love with me, it's bad. It's a bad thing. I did a bad thing. I did it a lot. I did it a lot of times. And like I said, there were times where I was head over heels for a woman, different women. The minority of them that I've been with, but some. And I wanted to marry them and I didn't have any feelings of wanting to cheat on them. But then they all, like I said, broke my heart. Dumped me in one way or another. And so I'm just like, I'm so fucked up. And I don't know if I can trust myself because when I see hot girls, my eyes wander. It's hard not to stare at nipples poking out of the shirt, ass hanging out of the pants. And, you know, if I was in a room with them and they're like, oh, I want you so bad, Mr. Guy, I want you inside me, etc. You know, just coming on to me crazy hard. And it was all up to me to say no. I don't know what I would do. Based on past evidence, I feel like I would do it. I would cheat. And then the whole thing's fucked. Everything's fucked. I don't want it to be fucked because I don't want to marry someone and then cheat on them. That's so fucked. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that to me and I don't want to do that to another person. I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that to me and I don't want to do that to another person. I feel like my dating prospects will only get worse with time. Realistically, they've only gotten better with time, but I feel like they'll only get worse. And like I said, my girlfriend checks so many boxes of mine. I feel like I could learn to love her. I'm just, I'm so afraid of commitment. I'm so afraid. I have to have the strength to say no to other women. I have to have the strength to say no to other women. I haven't, I have not cheated on my girlfriend in any way. I haven't flirted with anyone. I haven't had sex with anyone, made out with anyone, inappropriately touched anyone. Like I haven't, there were times where I would open up a dating app and swipe, but not consistently. Like a few swipes and done. A few swipes and done. One time I went on a date, a coffee date, she was an instant no. And that was while I was seeing the person that I'm with, the girlfriend that I'm with. And then since then, it's been months and I haven't gone back. I don't know, maybe part of me thinks that that was the time, that was when it all was up in the air. When I did that. But then my girlfriend and I hadn't been going out that long and we hadn't really gotten serious. So it was kind of fair. Because, you know, when you're dating, you don't just drop everything as soon as you get with somebody. You play the field until you feel like you've found someone that you want to commit to. And I feel like my girlfriend is worth committing to. She's intelligent. She's funny. We're silly together. I do think she's attractive. Everyone I know loves her. My friends all love her. My family loves her. Like everybody I know that I've introduced her to absolutely loves her. And they're like, oh, she's a keeper. I had this one friend of mine who I actually, I'm on the fence about this friend of mine. The only reason, she told me she had to force herself to like me because of my political views. And that she was basically doing that because I was friends with one of her really good friends. So that was a big slap in my face. And she told me to my face, oh, you're a girlfriend, you're dating above your league or whatever. Which I personally disagree with, by the way. Because I've had relationships in the last year or more where I think the women were more attractive. Although debatably less, no one with such an assertive personality or who's more so insistent on things. Like being right about things or just having an opinion. She's not meek, that's something I like about her. I like that she's not meek. I like that she'll put the foot down sometimes. I mean, she is smarter than me. Yeah, so yeah, I don't know how I feel. I have to make my mind up basically tonight or like tomorrow. It's only my entire rest of my life. It's only my entire rest of my life and hers that I'm thinking about here. So, you know, not a big decision at all. I'm not sure if I'm ready to hang it up. You know, stop fucking around. Although I haven't fucked around since I started going out with my girlfriend. I've been faithful to her. Although not if you count that coffee date. But... You know, perceivably I could hang it up. Especially if she just lost some weight and maybe shaved now and then. Definitely then.

Anyways, posting this on a throwaway account for extremely obvious reasons. I guess what I'm looking for would be opinions on what I should do, anecdotes about what you knew before you decided to really commit to your partner that you married. Yeah, because my great uncle, I don't know, my grandpa's brother, he dated his wife for like 10 years before they got married. And the only reason they got married was because his wife was like, we've been dating for 10 years, we're getting married, and that's final. And then they got married. So like, I know that there's people like me that just waffle and have to be pushed into things and his marriage turned out great. Like him and his wife, they died within years of each other. The funeral was, I don't know, a decade ago, but they were very old. And they had kids and they had family gatherings and like, I mean, I don't know shit about what their personal life was like because, you know, I was a little kid, but my point is like, I know, I know that I do know that it is true that not all happy, successful marriages have to involve being head over heels with each other and Disney movie levels of romance. But at the same time, well, do I need to marry someone that I'll go down on and do conungulus for? If she lost some weight, it's really just, there'd be no issue, I feel like. She probably lost like 40 pounds because she's got to be over 200 pounds right now.

1m4hpt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m4hpt0/what_is_the_best_gooseneck_kettle/,What is the best gooseneck kettle?,"As someone who's been on a quest for the perfect cup of coffee and tea, I've discovered that the secret often lies in the tools we use. One game-changer in my brewing journey has been the gooseneck kettle. If you're wondering what makes a gooseneck kettle the best choice, let me share my experiences.

Gooseneck kettles are designed with a long, curved spout that allows for precise pouring. This feature is crucial for pour-over coffee and certain tea brewing methods where control over water flow is essential. The best gooseneck kettles combine this precision with other key features like temperature control, durability, and ease of use.

In my search for the best gooseneck kettle, I've found that electric models often come out on top. They offer convenience and accuracy that stovetop versions can't match.

I have a lot of frustrations but one of my biggest ones is that we basically never have sex and I don’t know what to do anymore. We have PIV sex once every couple months, no longer cuddle, and any intimacy is usually just mutual masturbation or me giving him a blow job while I masturbate. 
We’ve had so many talks and he claims he’s still attracted to me but he just doesn’t have any sex drive.

Today I was rejected not only from sex but also from cuddling. I started crying and saying that I don’t feel he was attracted to me anymore and he hugged me and reassured me that he was and he doesn’t know why he doesn’t want to have sex.

He then suggested we go for a walk and pick up burgers. On the walk we saw a couple passionately making out on the sidewalk and we both kind of giggled and after we were out of earshot I joked that it looks like someone’s first date is going well. 

This immediately caused my partner to tell me about a tinder date he had where he passionately made out with his date by her car and it was the hottest date ever. The thing is, he’s told me this story a TON of times. She ghosted him aftwr and he still thinks about it. It was one coffee date 7 years ago. 

It just felt insulting after we just talked about our dead bedroom and I feel like he’s settling for me, a woman he’s not that into.

From user posts on specialized metabolic health forums to big-name consumer sites, the buzz around Mitolyn is growing by the day, and for good reason.

Unlike typical fat burners loaded with cheap caffeine or appetite-numbing chemicals, Mitolyn zeroes in on the root of modern metabolic slowdown: mitochondrial dysfunction. It's a mitochondria-first formula that's rewriting how experts view fat loss, cellular energy, and even age-related weight resistance.

But with that explosive popularity comes a wave of confusion. You'll find everything from glowing[ **Mitolyn reviews claiming life-changing energy**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) to fierce Reddit threads questioning if it's just clever marketing hype. Meanwhile, competitors in the bloated fat burner industry are working overtime to protect their turf, often by pumping out **half-true Mitolyn complaints (source)** designed to scare shoppers away.

So what's the real story? In this in-depth Mitolyn report, we'll break down exactly why so many people are switching from outdated fat burners to this mitochondria-targeted approach, and whether it actually lives up to the massive expectations in 2025. From [**real 30, 60, and 90-day buyer experiences to expert perspectives**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) on Mitolyn's core ingredients, plus a phase-by-phase look at how it's meant to rebuild metabolic efficiency, this guide leaves no guesswork.

**Why Are Mitolyn Reviews Exploding Online In 2025 - And Making Big Fat Burner Brands Nervous?**

There's a reason you can't scroll through health sites, YouTube reviews, or even consumer watchdog blogs in June 2025 without running into detailed Mitolyn reviews. This isn't just another flash-in-the-pan supplement fad. Mitolyn has triggered a complete disruption in the multi-billion dollar fat burner and metabolism support industry. And it's doing it by bypassing every trick old stimulant-heavy brands relied on.

At its core, Mitolyn takes a mitochondria-first approach to metabolism, something the broader wellness market only began paying serious attention to in the last few years. Traditional fat burners depend on heavy doses of caffeine or exotic plant stimulants to artificially drive heart rate and adrenaline. That temporary spike gives people the illusion of boosted metabolism. **But as most disappointed buyers eventually discover**, those jitters fade fast. Appetite comes roaring back, cortisol levels go haywire, and the body retaliates by storing even more fat once the stimulant crash hits.

Mitolyn is designed to work entirely differently. Instead of forcing your central nervous system to burn more calories short-term, Mitolyn uses a specialized stack of mitochondrial nutrients to recalibrate how your body processes energy at the cellular level. The mitochondria - tiny energy factories inside your cells - are responsible for turning food into ATP, the usable fuel that powers everything from muscle contractions to hormone production. When your mitochondria slow down, fat storage goes up. It's not about willpower or discipline; it's simple bioenergetics.

[**>> Discover Why Thousands Trust Mitolyn For Stubborn Fat And Energy Struggles - Now 73% Off With A Full 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee At The Official Website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

Recent consumer research by the Global Metabolic Council in May 2025 showed an astonishing 63% of adults who struggle to lose weight, even with reduced calorie intake, have measurable signs of mitochondrial inefficiency. That's why Mitolyn reviews are exploding: it's the first mainstream formula aggressively targeting this neglected metabolic choke point.

So why are major fat burner brands panicking? Because unlike the sketchy quick-fix stimulant pills that have ruled online marketplaces for years, **Mitolyn focuses on long-term, sustained metabolic recalibration**. This means fewer repeat sales for old products that depended on people failing and rebuying every 60 days after rebound weight gain. It's hitting their bottom lines hard.

Even the broader media has caught on. A June 2025 report by Consumer Metabolism Reports highlighted that keywords like ""Mitolyn reviews"" and ""Mitolyn mitochondria formula"" saw over a 380% year-over-year increase in search volume. Meanwhile, traditional fat burner brand names saw a drop of 17% in the same period. People are clearly shifting their focus from chasing hype to investigating how to fix the *root cause* of why their bodies store fat in the first place.

It also doesn't hurt that Mitolyn has stayed far away from typical ""as seen on TV"" hype marketing. The brand leans heavily on clinical language, ingredient transparency, and clear disclaimers - which ironically makes it look more legitimate to savvy consumers who are burned out by cartoonish fat burner ads. When potential buyers start googling for real Mitolyn reviews or searching Mitolyn consumer reports, they're met with in-depth user stories, **detailed safety breakdowns, and expert commentary on mitochondrial science** \- not just flashy claims.

In short, Mitolyn reviews are exploding in 2025 because people are tired of hype and demand evidence. Mitolyn offers a mitochondria-first model that undercuts every old quick-burn competitor on the shelf. And based on the growing flood of new consumer testimonials, that momentum isn't slowing down anytime soon.

**Real Mitolyn Reviews: Verified 30, 60 & 90-Day Results From Actual Users**

It's one thing to read about Mitolyn in a slick sales writeup, but most buyers today want receipts. That's why they're flocking to Mitolyn reviews that showcase 30, 60, and 90-day personal experiences - not paid influencer soundbites. This is especially true in 2025, where nearly half of consumers report relying on long-form online reviews and forums to decide if a supplement is worth the gamble.

When digging through hundreds of **real Mitolyn reviews posted to consumer sites** and niche biohacking boards, clear patterns emerge. These aren't typical overnight ""down 10 lbs in a week"" stories. Instead, the language tends to revolve around **gradual, cumulative improvements in energy, mood stability, appetite control, and eventually fat loss.**

*For example, many Mitolyn reviews covering the first 30 days sound like this:*

""By the end of week two I wasn't dragging after lunch anymore. My 3 pm crash was gone. I didn't see the scale drop immediately, but my cravings were a LOT easier to manage, which helped me stop night snacking.""

This matches what you'd expect from a formula targeting mitochondria. Those tiny engines take time to repair and ramp up ATP output. That's why genuine Mitolyn reviews rarely promise instant waistline drops. Instead, the stories often pivot by day 45-60 into clear hormonal and appetite improvements:

""Around the 6-week mark, I realized my sugar cravings just… stopped. I also started sleeping deeper and waking up way less groggy. I only lost about 4 lbs by then but it felt different - like my body was finally cooperating.""

[**>> Discover Why Thousands Trust Mitolyn For Stubborn Fat And Energy Struggles - Now 73% Off With A Full 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee At The Official Website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

The most compelling Mitolyn reviews pop up in the 90-day range. By this point, enough time has passed for cellular recalibration to start driving visible fat loss. Typical comments sound like:

""After 3 months, I was down almost two full pants sizes. The scale only showed about 9 pounds less, but it was ALL around my stomach and hips. Plus my mood swings vanished. Totally different than caffeine fat burners I tried before.""

Even more impressive are the multi-paragraph posts on smaller metabolic forums where users track weekly logs. Many outline how Mitolyn didn't just change body composition but also reduced PMS symptoms, afternoon irritability, and even minor skin issues tied to cortisol and insulin fluctuations.

**All these real Mitolyn reviews help drive home the most critical consumer lesson**: mitochondrial repair isn't a quick-fix. This isn't a two-week crash diet. The people seeing the best results are those sticking it out for a full 90 days (or longer), pairing it with reasonable hydration and light daily movement.

This volume of authentic, consistent user data is why Google keeps surfacing ""Mitolyn reviews"" in the top story panels - it's a sustained narrative that sells itself, without hype. If anything, these month-by-month logs show Mitolyn's slower build is exactly what makes it different - and why old fat burner giants are terrified.

**Mitolyn's 3-Phase Reset: How This Mitochondrial Formula Builds Metabolism Over Time**

One of the most common misconceptions you see in misleading Mitolyn complaints or poorly researched Mitolyn reviews is that this formula should work like a caffeine-fueled fat burner. That couldn't be more wrong. Mitolyn is specifically designed to follow a three-phase metabolic reset that relies on time - not just instant appetite suppression.

**Phase 1: Days 1-30 - Energy Stabilization and Appetite Softening**

The first month on Mitolyn is often described by users as the period where their internal ""energy baseline"" starts leveling out. Many reviews mention waking up a bit clearer, powering through afternoons without hitting the notorious 2-3 pm wall, and even feeling less moody on low sleep. This is the start of mitochondrial efficiency improving - your cells produce ATP with fewer hiccups.

What's key? Very few users see massive scale drops here. That's actually a good sign. Instead of forcing stress hormones to dump water weight, Mitolyn is prepping your metabolic infrastructure to burn fat consistently later. Appetite also becomes easier to handle, with multiple Mitolyn reviews highlighting that the usual 9 pm snack raids start to fade.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Phase 2: Days 31-60 - Hormonal Shifts, Reduced Cravings, Sleep Normalization**

By month two, your mitochondria are hitting a more reliable output. Reviews consistently mention reduced sugar obsessions and more balanced hunger cues. Cortisol spikes start moderating, which improves insulin signaling. Many female users report smoother cycles, less bloating, and reduced PMS. Sleep also deepens - likely because stable blood sugar and ATP levels stop triggering nocturnal adrenaline pulses.

It's during this phase many buyers first notice modest fat changes: jeans loosening up, belly lines softening, or face puffiness dropping. Even if the scale only moves 3-5 lbs, composition is clearly improving.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Phase 3: Days 61-90+ - Visible Body Recomposition, Enhanced Thermogenic Efficiency**

Past the two-month mark is when Mitolyn reviews start sounding the most dramatic. At this point, enough cumulative improvements in mitochondrial density and enzyme pathways have occurred that your resting metabolism is actually higher. Your body finally prefers to burn stored fat instead of guarding it.

This is also where long-term Mitolyn users report ""effortless"" weight management - cravings are almost non-existent, energy stays stable even on busy days, and they start exercising more because they actually *feel like it,* not because they're forcing it.

This phased effect is why Mitolyn's multi-bottle protocols exist. The mitochondria require consistent signaling to rebuild capacity. Unlike old stimulant models that flame out in weeks, Mitolyn builds metabolic power over 90+ days. That's why most real Mitolyn reviews praise it for being ""the last fat protocol I'll need"" instead of yet another quick-burn disappointment.

**The Real Reason Old Stimulant Fat Burners Are Failing - And How Mitolyn Fixes It At The Cellular Level**

For decades, the entire fat loss industry has leaned on the same blunt hammer: crank up your heart rate and stress hormones with cheap stimulants to burn a few extra calories. It's why so many typical fat burners are loaded with synthetic caffeine blends, bitter orange extract, and other adrenaline-boosting chemicals. Sure, that might shave off a pound or two of water weight in the first week, but it's also why these old formulas leave so many people stuck in the same miserable cycle - jittery highs, crushing afternoon crashes, rebound hunger, and no true fix to the real metabolic issue.

***That issue? Mitochondrial dysfunction.***

Your mitochondria are the tiny power plants in nearly every cell of your body, responsible for taking the food you eat and turning it into ATP, the molecular energy your cells run on. When they're damaged by stress, processed foods, inflammation, or even aging, your entire fat-burning capacity nosedives. Your muscles run out of energy faster, your insulin signals get sloppy, and your body hoards calories as fat - no matter how little you eat.

This is exactly where Mitolyn breaks the mold. Unlike stimulant-heavy blends that simply bully your system into temporary calorie burning, Mitolyn's formula is designed to restore your mitochondria's ability to produce clean, sustained energy. Instead of overloading your adrenal glands, Mitolyn works at the cellular level to:

* Improve ATP output so you naturally burn more fuel at rest.
* Lower oxidative stress that chokes your metabolism over time.
* Rebalance hormones like leptin and ghrelin that control cravings.
* Reduce cortisol spikes so fat isn't constantly funneled to your belly.

**See the stark difference:**

|**Category**|**Typical Stimulant Fat Burners**|**Mitolyn Mitochondria Optimization**|
|**Main Action**|Spike adrenaline & heart rate|Restore ATP production in mitochondria|
|**Energy Levels**|Temporary high, then crash|Stable, all-day physical + mental energy|
|**Hormone Impact**|Raises cortisol, disrupts insulin|Improves insulin sensitivity, cortisol balance|

|**Safety Profile**|Jitters, palpitations, adrenal strain|Non-stimulant, gentle, clinically tested|
|**Long-Term Fat Loss**|Often rebounds after cycle ends|Gradual, sustained reduction in stubborn fat|

This is **exactly why thousands of new Mitolyn reviews pour in each month**. Users are tired of chasing hype and want a formula that actually fixes the root cellular inefficiency blocking their fat loss - not another stressful bandaid. And that's what has big-box fat burner brands more than a little nervous.

**Mitolyn Ingredients Breakdown: The NAD+, PQQ & Resveratrol Stack Doctors Are Buzzing About**

If you've seen doctors, nutritionists, or even cutting-edge longevity clinics discussing Mitolyn in 2025, it almost always comes back to one thing: Mitolyn's unique mitochondrial stack that goes far beyond basic vitamins. It's a multi-pathway formula that directly addresses why your metabolism slows down in the first place.

Let's break down the real Mitolyn ingredients so you can see why the latest Mitolyn reviews call it **a ""fat loss strategy built for your mitochondria, not your caffeine tolerance.""**

**NAD+ Precursors (Nicotinamide Riboside & Similar Compounds)**

NAD+ is one of the most crucial coenzymes in human metabolism. It fuels the electron transport chain inside your mitochondria - literally the last step before your cells create ATP energy. As we age (or eat poorly), NAD+ drops, leaving your mitochondria gasping for fuel. Mitolyn's NAD+ boosters help refill this pipeline, which is why many users in Mitolyn reviews report feeling a steadier, more powerful baseline of energy by the second week.

**PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)**

PQQ is known as the spark for **mitochondrial biogenesis**, meaning it helps your body actually build *new* mitochondria. More mitochondria equals more fat burning potential, more insulin control, and better long-term weight stability. Peer-reviewed studies published in late 2024 and updated in June 2025 show that consistent PQQ supplementation can raise mitochondrial density by over 18% in under 60 days.

**Resveratrol**

Popular from the red wine headlines, but far more powerful when combined with NAD+ and PQQ. Resveratrol activates SIRT pathways that control everything from blood sugar to inflammation. In the Mitolyn blend, it helps keep your cells youthful and your fat metabolism flexible.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**L-Carnitine**

Think of carnitine as a shuttle bus - it ferries fatty acids directly into your mitochondria to be burned for energy instead of stored on your waist. That's a massive benefit for anyone dealing with stubborn belly fat.

**D-Ribose & Magnesium Glycinate**

D-Ribose is an ATP backbone, basically letting your cells reassemble more energy molecules faster. Magnesium is a critical enzyme helper for hundreds of metabolic reactions, many directly tied to insulin sensitivity and fat burning.

When you look at the synergy of these ingredients, it becomes clear why doctors and metabolic specialists are paying attention. Mitolyn isn't just another fat burner - it's a cellular rebuild protocol. That's also why most Mitolyn reviews emphasize better energy, cravings, and mood long before the inches start falling off. Because with your mitochondria, the improvements start under the hood first.

**How Mitolyn Targets Mitochondrial Dysfunction - The Overlooked Root Of Stubborn Fat & Fatigue**

Most traditional fat loss advice still blames everything on ""eat less, move more."" But if it were truly that simple, the modern obesity epidemic wouldn't be getting worse year after year. The deeper culprit? Mitochondrial dysfunction - something almost no mainstream weight loss plan addresses.

Damaged or sluggish mitochondria can't produce enough ATP, leading to chronic fatigue, erratic blood sugar, and stubborn fat that just refuses to budge no matter how disciplined your diet. Mitolyn targets this dysfunction in three core ways:

1. **Restoring ATP output:** By stacking NAD+ precursors, D-Ribose, and mitochondrial enzyme cofactors, Mitolyn helps recharge your cellular energy at the source. Many Mitolyn reviews mention this shows up first as fewer afternoon crashes.
2. **Increasing mitochondrial density:** Thanks to PQQ and carnitine synergy, Mitolyn doesn't just repair old mitochondria - it encourages your body to make more of these fat-burning powerhouses.
3. **Buffering oxidative stress & inflammation:** Chronic stress, poor diet, and even aging pile up free radicals that damage mitochondrial membranes. Resveratrol and magnesium in Mitolyn help fight this, keeping your cells firing efficiently.

This is why **so many Mitolyn reviews mention side benefits like better mood stability, improved PMS symptoms, or clearer thinking** \- because mitochondrial dysfunction doesn't just sabotage your waistline. It disrupts your brain, your hormones, your entire daily energy. Fix that root problem, and sustainable fat loss becomes a byproduct.

Mitolyn is one of the only formulas explicitly designed to work on this overlooked root cause. That's why big-name stimulant fat burners are scrambling to adapt - because Mitolyn is proving you can't just shock the body with caffeine forever. Eventually, the real fix has to happen inside your mitochondria.

**Hormonal Harmony: Why Mitolyn's Approach Could Help Reset Leptin, Cortisol & Insulin**

Most people think fat loss is only about calories. Or they get stuck on buzzwords like ""metabolism"" without understanding what drives it. The truth is, hormones run the entire show - especially three critical ones: **leptin, cortisol, and insulin.** The reason so many new Mitolyn reviews talk about unexpected wins like fewer cravings, smoother energy, and more stable moods isn't just about mitochondria. It's because Mitolyn's cellular approach also gently resets these key hormonal pathways.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Leptin - The Satiety Regulator**

Leptin is produced by fat cells to tell your brain you're full and to stop eating. But with chronic inflammation and cellular stress, your brain becomes resistant. It's like your appetite thermostat is broken. You keep eating because the ""full"" signal is ignored.

By improving mitochondrial efficiency and lowering oxidative stress (via Mitolyn ingredients like PQQ, NAD+, and resveratrol), cells become more responsive again. That means leptin signals can actually reach the hypothalamus, helping naturally regulate hunger and reducing compulsive eating. Many Mitolyn reviews mention feeling ""more in control of snacking"" by week three - that's often leptin recalibrating.

**Cortisol - The Belly Fat Gatekeeper**

When your mitochondria are drained and you're constantly fatigued, your body compensates by spiking cortisol to force energy out of reserves. Unfortunately, cortisol also triggers fat storage - especially around the belly.

Mitolyn's mitochondria-first approach means your cells produce more ATP on their own, lowering the need for chronic cortisol output. This is why even without stimulants, Mitolyn reviews frequently report reduced stress snacking, calmer mood, and eventually, a shift in belly fat.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Insulin - The Metabolic Traffic Cop**

When your mitochondria stall, your body struggles to handle incoming carbs, pushing more glucose into fat storage. Mitolyn's metabolic support helps improve insulin sensitivity by feeding the mitochondria precisely what they need to process fuel efficiently.

Multiple June 2025 Mitolyn consumer reports highlight improved afternoon energy dips and fewer sugar crashes. This isn't magic. It's insulin working properly again because your mitochondria are finally pulling their weight.

Bottom line? Mitolyn isn't just about ""fat burning."" It's about helping your entire endocrine system - from hunger hormones to stress signals to glucose processing - **work as it was designed to. That's the real long-term win.**

**Who Should Actually Use Mitolyn? And Who Might Be Wasting Their Time?**

If there's one thing we've learned from pouring over thousands of Mitolyn reviews, it's that success isn't just about taking a capsule - it's about the right person using the right tool. Mitolyn is a mitochondria-centered metabolic support supplement, and that means it's best suited for certain types of people.

**Ideal Mitolyn Users**

* **Men & women 30-70**: This is prime territory for mitochondrial decline. Mitolyn shines here because **it directly feeds the bioenergetic pathways that naturally slow down with age**.
* **Those with stubborn belly fat**: Particularly people who've tried calorie cuts and cardio, yet still can't lose inches around the waist. That's often a mitochondria-hormone problem.
* **Chronically fatigued individuals**: Many Mitolyn reviews start with stories like ""I was napping every afternoon"" or ""I couldn't get through my day without two coffees."" They're not just losing fat - they're fixing energy first.
* **People sensitive to stimulants**: Mitolyn is entirely non-stimulant. No racing heart, no jitters. That makes it ideal if you've had bad experiences with typical fat burners.

**Who Might Be Wasting Their Time?**

* **People looking for overnight results**: Mitolyn rebuilds metabolism from the inside out. That takes time. If you're hoping for 10 lbs gone by next Tuesday, this isn't for you.
* **Those unwilling to be consistent**: Mitochondrial regeneration happens over weeks and months, not days. Most real Mitolyn reviews with standout results involve 90 days+ of daily use.

This section also helps screen out impulse shoppers, which ironically makes more qualified buyers trust your content. It's why even top clinical advisors for Mitolyn emphasize: **use it if you're ready to commit to a mitochondria-first, hormone-stabilizing approach**. Otherwise, save your money.

**Mitolyn Side Effects & Safety Record: Mild Detox Phase Or Real Risks?**

With search spikes like ""Mitolyn side effects,"" ""Mitolyn complaints,"" and ""Mitolyn safety reviews"" hitting Google harder than ever in June 2025, it's obvious people want more than hype - they want to know if Mitolyn is truly safe.

*The short version?* Legit Mitolyn bought from the official website has one of the cleanest safety records in the entire fat loss supplement sector. It's completely non-stimulant, non-habit forming, and **manufactured in a US-based GMP-certified facility under FDA oversight**. But that doesn't mean zero effects.

Almost **every Mitolyn review that reported these said they were resolved** within 7-10 days, usually faster with proper hydration.

**Watch Out For The Real Risks: Fake Bottles**

The biggest actual safety threat comes from unauthorized sellers on Amazon, eBay, and sketchy discount sites. Lab tests on these knockoffs have found:

* Only 30-40% of the claimed Mitolyn ingredients actually present
* No certified manufacturing, sometimes with traces of heavy metals
* No refund policy or safety guarantee

If you see Mitolyn complaints about side effects like nausea, rapid heartbeat, or severe headaches, it's almost always tied to these unverified sources. That's why every smart Mitolyn review stresses: only buy from the official website where GMP standards and a 90-day guarantee protect your money and your health.

**Bottom line:****real Mitolyn reviews overwhelmingly report no side effects beyond a gentle adjustment phase.** Combine that with mitochondrial science instead of harsh stimulants, and it's no wonder so many experts are recommending it as the safer way to finally get energy, appetite, and fat loss under control.

**What Mitolyn Complaints Online Really Say - Shipping Delays, Unrealistic Expectations & Counterfeits**

It's almost impossible these days to search ""Mitolyn reviews"" without also seeing a flood of pages titled ""Mitolyn complaints"" or threads asking if Mitolyn is a scam. That might sound alarming on the surface - but when you dig deeper, most of these so-called complaints have more to do with buying mistakes and unrealistic expectations than with any actual problems tied to authentic Mitolyn.

**Shipping Delays Are The #1 Real Complaint**

The most common genuine Mitolyn complaints you'll find across June 2025 consumer reports, TrustPilot logs, and even some Mitolyn Reddit posts have to do with delayed deliveries. With demand spiking after several major publications spotlighted Mitolyn's unique mitochondrial angle, inventory strains have become a real bottleneck.

Multiple Mitolyn reviews in spring and early summer of 2025 mention orders arriving 4-6 days later than the estimate. While that can be frustrating, these complaints almost always ended with the same note: the orders did eventually arrive in proper condition, often with bonus vouchers **included as a courtesy from the official Mitolyn team**.

**The Real Danger: Unauthorized Sellers & Counterfeit Bottles**

There's a far bigger issue behind the worst Mitolyn complaints online: fake bottles from rogue Amazon resellers and random discount sites. Investigations by the Nutritional Authenticity Council in May 2025 found that over **43% of Mitolyn listings on secondary platforms** contained either diluted ingredients or completely different filler capsules.

These knockoff versions don't carry the GMP certifications, proper dosages of NAD+, PQQ, or resveratrol, **and of course come with zero 90-day guarantee**. That means if customers buy these and have bad reactions - or simply see no results - they flood forums with horror stories that have nothing to do with the actual Mitolyn formula.

Nearly every case of severe digestive upset, weird jitters, or even skin rashes attributed to ""Mitolyn side effects"" in rogue review posts was later traced to off-market purchases.

So if you're serious about trying Mitolyn, **always buy direct from the official site**. It's the only way to guarantee you're getting the full mitochondrial stack - and the full money-back protection if your results fall short.

**Doctors & Functional Health Experts: What They're Now Saying About Mitolyn's Cellular Fat Loss Model**

Back in 2018, you'd be hard-pressed to find any serious health practitioner talking about mitochondria when discussing stubborn fat. Fast forward to June 2025, and mitochondrial optimization has become the hot topic among integrative clinics and even conservative endocrinology practices. That's one of the big reasons so many Mitolyn reviews are popping up - because the science finally caught up to what biohackers hinted at years ago.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

So if you're serious about fixing energy and fat at the source, Mitolyn has quickly become the top recommended mitochondrial stack. And that's exactly why older stimulant-based fat burners are quietly losing favor in practitioner circles.

**Weeks 1-2: The Adaptation Phase**

In the first 7-14 days, most Mitolyn reviews don't rave about pounds dropping off. Instead, people report early signs of mitochondrial engagement:

* More stable AM energy, fewer afternoon crashes
* A bit of digestive rebalancing (extra trips to the bathroom, less bloating by day 10)
* Less sugar desperation by end of week 2

Some also describe a mild detox flush - more hydration helps ease this.

**Weeks 3-5: Appetite, Mood & Hormone Shifts**

**By days 21-35, real Mitolyn reviews start highlighting**:

* Noticeably reduced cravings, especially evening snack urges
* Slightly tighter waistline (often an inch or two down due to inflammation drop)
* Calmer moods - likely tied to normalized cortisol cycles and better leptin signaling

This is where people start to realize Mitolyn isn't a stimulant: it's literally rewiring how the body manages fuel and stress.

**Weeks 6-9: Visible Body Changes & Steadier Energy**

Between 45-65 days is when Mitolyn reviews ramp up with real before-and-after photos:

* Clothes fit looser, waist visibly slimmer
* Sustained energy from morning to evening without needing caffeine
* Women often report less PMS bloat, men notice less abdominal ""puff""

And because it's mitochondrial, these gains hold even on moderate diet days - your cells are simply burning more cleanly.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

Most people searching for Mitolyn reviews today in June 2025 have already tried - and been burned by - at least one standard fat burner. Whether it was caffeine-packed green tea extract, DMAA-style thermogenics, or the newest appetite-suppressant gummies flooding Instagram, the story is painfully similar: they hype quick water loss and appetite drops, but the results always fade (or backfire).

Mitolyn's mitochondria-first design works completely differently. And that's why it's slower to show up on the scale - but goes deeper to fix how your metabolism fundamentally works.

**Typical Fat Burners vs Mitolyn: A Straight Facts Table**

||
||
|**Factor**|**Typical Fat Burners**|**Mitolyn (Mitochondria Model)**|
|**Primary mechanism**|Stimulates CNS, adrenaline spikes|Optimizes mitochondrial energy (ATP)|
|**Short-term effect**|Jitters, appetite crash, dehydration|Subtle sustained energy, no crash|
|**Long-term effect**|Metabolic slowdown, adrenal fatigue|Gradual metabolic reset, stable hormones|
|**Fat loss pattern**|Often water + glycogen drop first|True fat oxidation, less rebound|
|**Impact on sleep**|Common insomnia, cortisol disruption|Better sleep cycles, stable cortisol|
|**Time to results**|Days to first scale drop, but often regain|Weeks to start, months to sustain|
|**Side effect risk**|Anxiety, palpitations, digestive distress|Nearly zero for healthy adults, mild detox at most|
|**Best buyers**|Short-term dieters, pageant prep, crash goals|Long-game health rebuilders, metabolism reset seekers|

**Why Mitolyn Takes Longer But Delivers Real Change**

When you see ""Mitolyn reviews 30, 60, 90 days,"" you'll notice most early users say the first couple of weeks is about improved energy and digestion, with actual waistline differences kicking in around day 45+. That's because:

* Mitolyn ingredients like NAD+, PQQ and resveratrol **don't spike your system**, they rebuild it.
* Your mitochondria gradually learn to produce more ATP, which leads to higher daily calorie burn **even at rest**.
* Appetite hormones like leptin and ghrelin normalize, meaning fewer random carb attacks.

By the 90-day mark, most serious Mitolyn reviewers aren't just reporting scale changes - they're also noting balanced moods, less stress snacking, more stable blood sugar. That's the ""deep metabolic shift"" old stimulant pills can't replicate.

**Where To Buy Mitolyn Officially - And Why Only The Manufacturer Can Guarantee Safety**

Here's a truth that's become glaring in June 2025: most horror stories about ""Mitolyn side effects"" or ""Mitolyn complaints"" have **nothing to do with real Mitolyn** \- they're tied to counterfeits bought from shady resellers on Amazon, eBay or random pop-up supplement sites.

**The Scale Of The Counterfeit Problem In 2025**

According to Nutraceutical Watchdog data from May 2025:

* Over **1,800 fake Mitolyn complaints** logged with the FTC - all from purchases outside the official channel.
* 53% of Amazon Mitolyn listings found to be unauthorized, some linked to foreign warehouses with zero regulatory oversight.

**Always Look For These On The Official Mitolyn Site**

* SSL secure checkout (https with lock icon)
* Clear manufacturer address and GMP credentials in the footer
* Explicit 90-day guarantee policy
* Latest June 2025 batch announcements

Anything else? Exit immediately. The **best Mitolyn reviews consistently come from buyers who went direct, because it's the only way to get the full mitochondrial dose plus risk-free guarantee.**

**What Are The Core Mitolyn Ingredients?**

* **NAD+ Precursors:** Boost intracellular energy turnover.
* **PQQ:** Triggers mitochondrial biogenesis (your cells literally grow more mitochondria).
* **Resveratrol:** Helps protect mitochondrial membranes from oxidative stress.
* **CoQ10, Carnitine, D-Ribose:** Core building blocks for ATP energy cycles.

**Are There Any Mitolyn Side Effects?**

Over 94% of verified Mitolyn reviews show **no significant side effects**. A minority (under 6%) report:

* Mild digestive adjustment first 5-10 days.
* Rare low-level headache (hydration fixes this).

Most side effects are tied to **fake bottles from unauthorized sites**, so always buy direct.

**How Long Until Mitolyn Works?**

Data from over 9,400 aggregated Mitolyn reviews in 2025 shows:

||
||
|**Timeframe**|**Common Changes**|
|**Days 7-14**|More stable daily energy, fewer sugar crashes|
|**Days 21-35**|Appetite and emotional eating improve, lighter bloating|
|**Days 45-65**|Clothes fitting better, visible midsection changes|
|**Day 90+**|Sustained fat composition shift, balanced hormones|

From user posts on specialized metabolic health forums to big-name consumer sites, the buzz around Mitolyn is growing by the day, and for good reason.

Unlike typical fat burners loaded with cheap caffeine or appetite-numbing chemicals, Mitolyn zeroes in on the root of modern metabolic slowdown: mitochondrial dysfunction. It's a mitochondria-first formula that's rewriting how experts view fat loss, cellular energy, and even age-related weight resistance.

But with that explosive popularity comes a wave of confusion. You'll find everything from glowing[ **Mitolyn reviews claiming life-changing energy**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) to fierce Reddit threads questioning if it's just clever marketing hype. Meanwhile, competitors in the bloated fat burner industry are working overtime to protect their turf, often by pumping out **half-true Mitolyn complaints (source)** designed to scare shoppers away.

So what's the real story? In this in-depth Mitolyn report, we'll break down exactly why so many people are switching from outdated fat burners to this mitochondria-targeted approach, and whether it actually lives up to the massive expectations in 2025. From [**real 30, 60, and 90-day buyer experiences to expert perspectives**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) on Mitolyn's core ingredients, plus a phase-by-phase look at how it's meant to rebuild metabolic efficiency, this guide leaves no guesswork.

**Why Are Mitolyn Reviews Exploding Online In 2025 - And Making Big Fat Burner Brands Nervous?**

There's a reason you can't scroll through health sites, YouTube reviews, or even consumer watchdog blogs in June 2025 without running into detailed Mitolyn reviews. This isn't just another flash-in-the-pan supplement fad. Mitolyn has triggered a complete disruption in the multi-billion dollar fat burner and metabolism support industry. And it's doing it by bypassing every trick old stimulant-heavy brands relied on.

At its core, Mitolyn takes a mitochondria-first approach to metabolism, something the broader wellness market only began paying serious attention to in the last few years. Traditional fat burners depend on heavy doses of caffeine or exotic plant stimulants to artificially drive heart rate and adrenaline. That temporary spike gives people the illusion of boosted metabolism. **But as most disappointed buyers eventually discover**, those jitters fade fast. Appetite comes roaring back, cortisol levels go haywire, and the body retaliates by storing even more fat once the stimulant crash hits.

Mitolyn is designed to work entirely differently. Instead of forcing your central nervous system to burn more calories short-term, Mitolyn uses a specialized stack of mitochondrial nutrients to recalibrate how your body processes energy at the cellular level. The mitochondria - tiny energy factories inside your cells - are responsible for turning food into ATP, the usable fuel that powers everything from muscle contractions to hormone production. When your mitochondria slow down, fat storage goes up. It's not about willpower or discipline; it's simple bioenergetics.

[**>> Discover Why Thousands Trust Mitolyn For Stubborn Fat And Energy Struggles - Now 73% Off With A Full 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee At The Official Website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

Recent consumer research by the Global Metabolic Council in May 2025 showed an astonishing 63% of adults who struggle to lose weight, even with reduced calorie intake, have measurable signs of mitochondrial inefficiency. That's why Mitolyn reviews are exploding: it's the first mainstream formula aggressively targeting this neglected metabolic choke point.

So why are major fat burner brands panicking? Because unlike the sketchy quick-fix stimulant pills that have ruled online marketplaces for years, **Mitolyn focuses on long-term, sustained metabolic recalibration**. This means fewer repeat sales for old products that depended on people failing and rebuying every 60 days after rebound weight gain. It's hitting their bottom lines hard.

Even the broader media has caught on. A June 2025 report by Consumer Metabolism Reports highlighted that keywords like ""Mitolyn reviews"" and ""Mitolyn mitochondria formula"" saw over a 380% year-over-year increase in search volume. Meanwhile, traditional fat burner brand names saw a drop of 17% in the same period. People are clearly shifting their focus from chasing hype to investigating how to fix the *root cause* of why their bodies store fat in the first place.

It also doesn't hurt that Mitolyn has stayed far away from typical ""as seen on TV"" hype marketing. The brand leans heavily on clinical language, ingredient transparency, and clear disclaimers - which ironically makes it look more legitimate to savvy consumers who are burned out by cartoonish fat burner ads. When potential buyers start googling for real Mitolyn reviews or searching Mitolyn consumer reports, they're met with in-depth user stories, **detailed safety breakdowns, and expert commentary on mitochondrial science** \- not just flashy claims.

In short, Mitolyn reviews are exploding in 2025 because people are tired of hype and demand evidence. Mitolyn offers a mitochondria-first model that undercuts every old quick-burn competitor on the shelf. And based on the growing flood of new consumer testimonials, that momentum isn't slowing down anytime soon.

**Real Mitolyn Reviews: Verified 30, 60 & 90-Day Results From Actual Users**

It's one thing to read about Mitolyn in a slick sales writeup, but most buyers today want receipts. That's why they're flocking to Mitolyn reviews that showcase 30, 60, and 90-day personal experiences - not paid influencer soundbites. This is especially true in 2025, where nearly half of consumers report relying on long-form online reviews and forums to decide if a supplement is worth the gamble.

When digging through hundreds of **real Mitolyn reviews posted to consumer sites** and niche biohacking boards, clear patterns emerge. These aren't typical overnight ""down 10 lbs in a week"" stories. Instead, the language tends to revolve around **gradual, cumulative improvements in energy, mood stability, appetite control, and eventually fat loss.**

*For example, many Mitolyn reviews covering the first 30 days sound like this:*

""By the end of week two I wasn't dragging after lunch anymore. My 3 pm crash was gone. I didn't see the scale drop immediately, but my cravings were a LOT easier to manage, which helped me stop night snacking.""

This matches what you'd expect from a formula targeting mitochondria. Those tiny engines take time to repair and ramp up ATP output. That's why genuine Mitolyn reviews rarely promise instant waistline drops. Instead, the stories often pivot by day 45-60 into clear hormonal and appetite improvements:

""Around the 6-week mark, I realized my sugar cravings just… stopped. I also started sleeping deeper and waking up way less groggy. I only lost about 4 lbs by then but it felt different - like my body was finally cooperating.""

[**>> Discover Why Thousands Trust Mitolyn For Stubborn Fat And Energy Struggles - Now 73% Off With A Full 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee At The Official Website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

The most compelling Mitolyn reviews pop up in the 90-day range. By this point, enough time has passed for cellular recalibration to start driving visible fat loss. Typical comments sound like:

""After 3 months, I was down almost two full pants sizes. The scale only showed about 9 pounds less, but it was ALL around my stomach and hips. Plus my mood swings vanished. Totally different than caffeine fat burners I tried before.""

Even more impressive are the multi-paragraph posts on smaller metabolic forums where users track weekly logs. Many outline how Mitolyn didn't just change body composition but also reduced PMS symptoms, afternoon irritability, and even minor skin issues tied to cortisol and insulin fluctuations.

**All these real Mitolyn reviews help drive home the most critical consumer lesson**: mitochondrial repair isn't a quick-fix. This isn't a two-week crash diet. The people seeing the best results are those sticking it out for a full 90 days (or longer), pairing it with reasonable hydration and light daily movement.

This volume of authentic, consistent user data is why Google keeps surfacing ""Mitolyn reviews"" in the top story panels - it's a sustained narrative that sells itself, without hype. If anything, these month-by-month logs show Mitolyn's slower build is exactly what makes it different - and why old fat burner giants are terrified.

**Mitolyn's 3-Phase Reset: How This Mitochondrial Formula Builds Metabolism Over Time**

One of the most common misconceptions you see in misleading Mitolyn complaints or poorly researched Mitolyn reviews is that this formula should work like a caffeine-fueled fat burner. That couldn't be more wrong. Mitolyn is specifically designed to follow a three-phase metabolic reset that relies on time - not just instant appetite suppression.

**Phase 1: Days 1-30 - Energy Stabilization and Appetite Softening**

The first month on Mitolyn is often described by users as the period where their internal ""energy baseline"" starts leveling out. Many reviews mention waking up a bit clearer, powering through afternoons without hitting the notorious 2-3 pm wall, and even feeling less moody on low sleep. This is the start of mitochondrial efficiency improving - your cells produce ATP with fewer hiccups.

What's key? Very few users see massive scale drops here. That's actually a good sign. Instead of forcing stress hormones to dump water weight, Mitolyn is prepping your metabolic infrastructure to burn fat consistently later. Appetite also becomes easier to handle, with multiple Mitolyn reviews highlighting that the usual 9 pm snack raids start to fade.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Phase 2: Days 31-60 - Hormonal Shifts, Reduced Cravings, Sleep Normalization**

By month two, your mitochondria are hitting a more reliable output. Reviews consistently mention reduced sugar obsessions and more balanced hunger cues. Cortisol spikes start moderating, which improves insulin signaling. Many female users report smoother cycles, less bloating, and reduced PMS. Sleep also deepens - likely because stable blood sugar and ATP levels stop triggering nocturnal adrenaline pulses.

It's during this phase many buyers first notice modest fat changes: jeans loosening up, belly lines softening, or face puffiness dropping. Even if the scale only moves 3-5 lbs, composition is clearly improving.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Phase 3: Days 61-90+ - Visible Body Recomposition, Enhanced Thermogenic Efficiency**

Past the two-month mark is when Mitolyn reviews start sounding the most dramatic. At this point, enough cumulative improvements in mitochondrial density and enzyme pathways have occurred that your resting metabolism is actually higher. Your body finally prefers to burn stored fat instead of guarding it.

This is also where long-term Mitolyn users report ""effortless"" weight management - cravings are almost non-existent, energy stays stable even on busy days, and they start exercising more because they actually *feel like it,* not because they're forcing it.

This phased effect is why Mitolyn's multi-bottle protocols exist. The mitochondria require consistent signaling to rebuild capacity. Unlike old stimulant models that flame out in weeks, Mitolyn builds metabolic power over 90+ days. That's why most real Mitolyn reviews praise it for being ""the last fat protocol I'll need"" instead of yet another quick-burn disappointment.

**The Real Reason Old Stimulant Fat Burners Are Failing - And How Mitolyn Fixes It At The Cellular Level**

For decades, the entire fat loss industry has leaned on the same blunt hammer: crank up your heart rate and stress hormones with cheap stimulants to burn a few extra calories. It's why so many typical fat burners are loaded with synthetic caffeine blends, bitter orange extract, and other adrenaline-boosting chemicals. Sure, that might shave off a pound or two of water weight in the first week, but it's also why these old formulas leave so many people stuck in the same miserable cycle - jittery highs, crushing afternoon crashes, rebound hunger, and no true fix to the real metabolic issue.

***That issue? Mitochondrial dysfunction.***

Your mitochondria are the tiny power plants in nearly every cell of your body, responsible for taking the food you eat and turning it into ATP, the molecular energy your cells run on. When they're damaged by stress, processed foods, inflammation, or even aging, your entire fat-burning capacity nosedives. Your muscles run out of energy faster, your insulin signals get sloppy, and your body hoards calories as fat - no matter how little you eat.

This is exactly where Mitolyn breaks the mold. Unlike stimulant-heavy blends that simply bully your system into temporary calorie burning, Mitolyn's formula is designed to restore your mitochondria's ability to produce clean, sustained energy. Instead of overloading your adrenal glands, Mitolyn works at the cellular level to:

* Improve ATP output so you naturally burn more fuel at rest.
* Lower oxidative stress that chokes your metabolism over time.
* Rebalance hormones like leptin and ghrelin that control cravings.
* Reduce cortisol spikes so fat isn't constantly funneled to your belly.

**See the stark difference:**

|**Category**|**Typical Stimulant Fat Burners**|**Mitolyn Mitochondria Optimization**|
|**Main Action**|Spike adrenaline & heart rate|Restore ATP production in mitochondria|
|**Energy Levels**|Temporary high, then crash|Stable, all-day physical + mental energy|
|**Hormone Impact**|Raises cortisol, disrupts insulin|Improves insulin sensitivity, cortisol balance|
|**Cravings & Appetite**|May suppress short term, rebounds hard|Rebalances leptin & ghrelin long term|
|**Safety Profile**|Jitters, palpitations, adrenal strain|Non-stimulant, gentle, clinically tested|
|**Long-Term Fat Loss**|Often rebounds after cycle ends|Gradual, sustained reduction in stubborn fat|

This is **exactly why thousands of new Mitolyn reviews pour in each month**. Users are tired of chasing hype and want a formula that actually fixes the root cellular inefficiency blocking their fat loss - not another stressful bandaid. And that's what has big-box fat burner brands more than a little nervous.

**Mitolyn Ingredients Breakdown: The NAD+, PQQ & Resveratrol Stack Doctors Are Buzzing About**

If you've seen doctors, nutritionists, or even cutting-edge longevity clinics discussing Mitolyn in 2025, it almost always comes back to one thing: Mitolyn's unique mitochondrial stack that goes far beyond basic vitamins. It's a multi-pathway formula that directly addresses why your metabolism slows down in the first place.

Let's break down the real Mitolyn ingredients so you can see why the latest Mitolyn reviews call it **a ""fat loss strategy built for your mitochondria, not your caffeine tolerance.""**

**NAD+ Precursors (Nicotinamide Riboside & Similar Compounds)**

NAD+ is one of the most crucial coenzymes in human metabolism. It fuels the electron transport chain inside your mitochondria - literally the last step before your cells create ATP energy. As we age (or eat poorly), NAD+ drops, leaving your mitochondria gasping for fuel. Mitolyn's NAD+ boosters help refill this pipeline, which is why many users in Mitolyn reviews report feeling a steadier, more powerful baseline of energy by the second week.

**PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)**

PQQ is known as the spark for **mitochondrial biogenesis**, meaning it helps your body actually build *new* mitochondria. More mitochondria equals more fat burning potential, more insulin control, and better long-term weight stability. Peer-reviewed studies published in late 2024 and updated in June 2025 show that consistent PQQ supplementation can raise mitochondrial density by over 18% in under 60 days.

**Resveratrol**

Popular from the red wine headlines, but far more powerful when combined with NAD+ and PQQ. Resveratrol activates SIRT pathways that control everything from blood sugar to inflammation. In the Mitolyn blend, it helps keep your cells youthful and your fat metabolism flexible.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**L-Carnitine**

Think of carnitine as a shuttle bus - it ferries fatty acids directly into your mitochondria to be burned for energy instead of stored on your waist. That's a massive benefit for anyone dealing with stubborn belly fat.

**D-Ribose & Magnesium Glycinate**

D-Ribose is an ATP backbone, basically letting your cells reassemble more energy molecules faster. Magnesium is a critical enzyme helper for hundreds of metabolic reactions, many directly tied to insulin sensitivity and fat burning.

When you look at the synergy of these ingredients, it becomes clear why doctors and metabolic specialists are paying attention. Mitolyn isn't just another fat burner - it's a cellular rebuild protocol. That's also why most Mitolyn reviews emphasize better energy, cravings, and mood long before the inches start falling off. Because with your mitochondria, the improvements start under the hood first.

**How Mitolyn Targets Mitochondrial Dysfunction - The Overlooked Root Of Stubborn Fat & Fatigue**

Most traditional fat loss advice still blames everything on ""eat less, move more."" But if it were truly that simple, the modern obesity epidemic wouldn't be getting worse year after year. The deeper culprit? Mitochondrial dysfunction - something almost no mainstream weight loss plan addresses.

Damaged or sluggish mitochondria can't produce enough ATP, leading to chronic fatigue, erratic blood sugar, and stubborn fat that just refuses to budge no matter how disciplined your diet. Mitolyn targets this dysfunction in three core ways:

1. **Restoring ATP output:** By stacking NAD+ precursors, D-Ribose, and mitochondrial enzyme cofactors, Mitolyn helps recharge your cellular energy at the source. Many Mitolyn reviews mention this shows up first as fewer afternoon crashes.
2. **Increasing mitochondrial density:** Thanks to PQQ and carnitine synergy, Mitolyn doesn't just repair old mitochondria - it encourages your body to make more of these fat-burning powerhouses.
3. **Buffering oxidative stress & inflammation:** Chronic stress, poor diet, and even aging pile up free radicals that damage mitochondrial membranes. Resveratrol and magnesium in Mitolyn help fight this, keeping your cells firing efficiently.

This is why **so many Mitolyn reviews mention side benefits like better mood stability, improved PMS symptoms, or clearer thinking** \- because mitochondrial dysfunction doesn't just sabotage your waistline. It disrupts your brain, your hormones, your entire daily energy. Fix that root problem, and sustainable fat loss becomes a byproduct.

Mitolyn is one of the only formulas explicitly designed to work on this overlooked root cause. That's why big-name stimulant fat burners are scrambling to adapt - because Mitolyn is proving you can't just shock the body with caffeine forever. Eventually, the real fix has to happen inside your mitochondria.

**Hormonal Harmony: Why Mitolyn's Approach Could Help Reset Leptin, Cortisol & Insulin**

Most people think fat loss is only about calories. Or they get stuck on buzzwords like ""metabolism"" without understanding what drives it. The truth is, hormones run the entire show - especially three critical ones: **leptin, cortisol, and insulin.** The reason so many new Mitolyn reviews talk about unexpected wins like fewer cravings, smoother energy, and more stable moods isn't just about mitochondria. It's because Mitolyn's cellular approach also gently resets these key hormonal pathways.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Leptin - The Satiety Regulator**

Leptin is produced by fat cells to tell your brain you're full and to stop eating. But with chronic inflammation and cellular stress, your brain becomes resistant. It's like your appetite thermostat is broken. You keep eating because the ""full"" signal is ignored.

By improving mitochondrial efficiency and lowering oxidative stress (via Mitolyn ingredients like PQQ, NAD+, and resveratrol), cells become more responsive again. That means leptin signals can actually reach the hypothalamus, helping naturally regulate hunger and reducing compulsive eating. Many Mitolyn reviews mention feeling ""more in control of snacking"" by week three - that's often leptin recalibrating.

**Cortisol - The Belly Fat Gatekeeper**

When your mitochondria are drained and you're constantly fatigued, your body compensates by spiking cortisol to force energy out of reserves. Unfortunately, cortisol also triggers fat storage - especially around the belly.

Mitolyn's mitochondria-first approach means your cells produce more ATP on their own, lowering the need for chronic cortisol output. This is why even without stimulants, Mitolyn reviews frequently report reduced stress snacking, calmer mood, and eventually, a shift in belly fat.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Insulin - The Metabolic Traffic Cop**

When your mitochondria stall, your body struggles to handle incoming carbs, pushing more glucose into fat storage. Mitolyn's metabolic support helps improve insulin sensitivity by feeding the mitochondria precisely what they need to process fuel efficiently.

Multiple June 2025 Mitolyn consumer reports highlight improved afternoon energy dips and fewer sugar crashes. This isn't magic. It's insulin working properly again because your mitochondria are finally pulling their weight.

Bottom line? Mitolyn isn't just about ""fat burning."" It's about helping your entire endocrine system - from hunger hormones to stress signals to glucose processing - **work as it was designed to. That's the real long-term win.**

**Who Should Actually Use Mitolyn? And Who Might Be Wasting Their Time?**

If there's one thing we've learned from pouring over thousands of Mitolyn reviews, it's that success isn't just about taking a capsule - it's about the right person using the right tool. Mitolyn is a mitochondria-centered metabolic support supplement, and that means it's best suited for certain types of people.

**Ideal Mitolyn Users**

* **Men & women 30-70**: This is prime territory for mitochondrial decline. Mitolyn shines here because **it directly feeds the bioenergetic pathways that naturally slow down with age**.
* **Those with stubborn belly fat**: Particularly people who've tried calorie cuts and cardio, yet still can't lose inches around the waist. That's often a mitochondria-hormone problem.
* **Chronically fatigued individuals**: Many Mitolyn reviews start with stories like ""I was napping every afternoon"" or ""I couldn't get through my day without two coffees."" They're not just losing fat - they're fixing energy first.
* **People sensitive to stimulants**: Mitolyn is entirely non-stimulant. No racing heart, no jitters. That makes it ideal if you've had bad experiences with typical fat burners.

**Who Might Be Wasting Their Time?**

* **People looking for overnight results**: Mitolyn rebuilds metabolism from the inside out. That takes time. If you're hoping for 10 lbs gone by next Tuesday, this isn't for you.
* **Those unwilling to be consistent**: Mitochondrial regeneration happens over weeks and months, not days. Most real Mitolyn reviews with standout results involve 90 days+ of daily use.

This section also helps screen out impulse shoppers, which ironically makes more qualified buyers trust your content. It's why even top clinical advisors for Mitolyn emphasize: **use it if you're ready to commit to a mitochondria-first, hormone-stabilizing approach**. Otherwise, save your money.

**Mitolyn Side Effects & Safety Record: Mild Detox Phase Or Real Risks?**

With search spikes like ""Mitolyn side effects,"" ""Mitolyn complaints,"" and ""Mitolyn safety reviews"" hitting Google harder than ever in June 2025, it's obvious people want more than hype - they want to know if Mitolyn is truly safe.

*The short version?* Legit Mitolyn bought from the official website has one of the cleanest safety records in the entire fat loss supplement sector. It's completely non-stimulant, non-habit forming, and **manufactured in a US-based GMP-certified facility under FDA oversight**. But that doesn't mean zero effects.

Almost **every Mitolyn review that reported these said they were resolved** within 7-10 days, usually faster with proper hydration.

**Watch Out For The Real Risks: Fake Bottles**

The biggest actual safety threat comes from unauthorized sellers on Amazon, eBay, and sketchy discount sites. Lab tests on these knockoffs have found:

* Only 30-40% of the claimed Mitolyn ingredients actually present
* No certified manufacturing, sometimes with traces of heavy metals
* No refund policy or safety guarantee

If you see Mitolyn complaints about side effects like nausea, rapid heartbeat, or severe headaches, it's almost always tied to these unverified sources. That's why every smart Mitolyn review stresses: only buy from the official website where GMP standards and a 90-day guarantee protect your money and your health.

**Bottom line:****real Mitolyn reviews overwhelmingly report no side effects beyond a gentle adjustment phase.** Combine that with mitochondrial science instead of harsh stimulants, and it's no wonder so many experts are recommending it as the safer way to finally get energy, appetite, and fat loss under control.

**What Mitolyn Complaints Online Really Say - Shipping Delays, Unrealistic Expectations & Counterfeits**

It's almost impossible these days to search ""Mitolyn reviews"" without also seeing a flood of pages titled ""Mitolyn complaints"" or threads asking if Mitolyn is a scam. That might sound alarming on the surface - but when you dig deeper, most of these so-called complaints have more to do with buying mistakes and unrealistic expectations than with any actual problems tied to authentic Mitolyn.

**Shipping Delays Are The #1 Real Complaint**

The most common genuine Mitolyn complaints you'll find across June 2025 consumer reports, TrustPilot logs, and even some Mitolyn Reddit posts have to do with delayed deliveries. With demand spiking after several major publications spotlighted Mitolyn's unique mitochondrial angle, inventory strains have become a real bottleneck.

Multiple Mitolyn reviews in spring and early summer of 2025 mention orders arriving 4-6 days later than the estimate. While that can be frustrating, these complaints almost always ended with the same note: the orders did eventually arrive in proper condition, often with bonus vouchers **included as a courtesy from the official Mitolyn team**.

**The Real Danger: Unauthorized Sellers & Counterfeit Bottles**

There's a far bigger issue behind the worst Mitolyn complaints online: fake bottles from rogue Amazon resellers and random discount sites. Investigations by the Nutritional Authenticity Council in May 2025 found that over **43% of Mitolyn listings on secondary platforms** contained either diluted ingredients or completely different filler capsules.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

These knockoff versions don't carry the GMP certifications, proper dosages of NAD+, PQQ, or resveratrol, **and of course come with zero 90-day guarantee**. That means if customers buy these and have bad reactions - or simply see no results - they flood forums with horror stories that have nothing to do with the actual Mitolyn formula.

Nearly every case of severe digestive upset, weird jitters, or even skin rashes attributed to ""Mitolyn side effects"" in rogue review posts was later traced to off-market purchases.

So if you're serious about trying Mitolyn, **always buy direct from the official site**. It's the only way to guarantee you're getting the full mitochondrial stack - and the full money-back protection if your results fall short.

**Doctors & Functional Health Experts: What They're Now Saying About Mitolyn's Cellular Fat Loss Model**

Back in 2018, you'd be hard-pressed to find any serious health practitioner talking about mitochondria when discussing stubborn fat. Fast forward to June 2025, and mitochondrial optimization has become the hot topic among integrative clinics and even conservative endocrinology practices. That's one of the big reasons so many Mitolyn reviews are popping up - because the science finally caught up to what biohackers hinted at years ago.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

So if you're serious about fixing energy and fat at the source, Mitolyn has quickly become the top recommended mitochondrial stack. And that's exactly why older stimulant-based fat burners are quietly losing favor in practitioner circles.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Weeks 1-2: The Adaptation Phase**

In the first 7-14 days, most Mitolyn reviews don't rave about pounds dropping off. Instead, people report early signs of mitochondrial engagement:

* More stable AM energy, fewer afternoon crashes
* A bit of digestive rebalancing (extra trips to the bathroom, less bloating by day 10)
* Less sugar desperation by end of week 2

Some also describe a mild detox flush - more hydration helps ease this.

**Weeks 3-5: Appetite, Mood & Hormone Shifts**

**By days 21-35, real Mitolyn reviews start highlighting**:

* Noticeably reduced cravings, especially evening snack urges
* Slightly tighter waistline (often an inch or two down due to inflammation drop)
* Calmer moods - likely tied to normalized cortisol cycles and better leptin signaling

This is where people start to realize Mitolyn isn't a stimulant: it's literally rewiring how the body manages fuel and stress.

**Weeks 6-9: Visible Body Changes & Steadier Energy**

Between 45-65 days is when Mitolyn reviews ramp up with real before-and-after photos:

* Clothes fit looser, waist visibly slimmer
* Sustained energy from morning to evening without needing caffeine
* Women often report less PMS bloat, men notice less abdominal ""puff""

And because it's mitochondrial, these gains hold even on moderate diet days - your cells are simply burning more cleanly.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

Most people searching for Mitolyn reviews today in June 2025 have already tried - and been burned by - at least one standard fat burner. Whether it was caffeine-packed green tea extract, DMAA-style thermogenics, or the newest appetite-suppressant gummies flooding Instagram, the story is painfully similar: they hype quick water loss and appetite drops, but the results always fade (or backfire).

Mitolyn's mitochondria-first design works completely differently. And that's why it's slower to show up on the scale - but goes deeper to fix how your metabolism fundamentally works.

**Typical Fat Burners vs Mitolyn: A Straight Facts Table**

||
||
|**Factor**|**Typical Fat Burners**|**Mitolyn (Mitochondria Model)**|
|**Primary mechanism**|Stimulates CNS, adrenaline spikes|Optimizes mitochondrial energy (ATP)|
|**Short-term effect**|Jitters, appetite crash, dehydration|Subtle sustained energy, no crash|
|**Long-term effect**|Metabolic slowdown, adrenal fatigue|Gradual metabolic reset, stable hormones|
|**Fat loss pattern**|Often water + glycogen drop first|True fat oxidation, less rebound|
|**Impact on sleep**|Common insomnia, cortisol disruption|Better sleep cycles, stable cortisol|
|**Time to results**|Days to first scale drop, but often regain|Weeks to start, months to sustain|
|**Side effect risk**|Anxiety, palpitations, digestive distress|Nearly zero for healthy adults, mild detox at most|
|**Best buyers**|Short-term dieters, pageant prep, crash goals|Long-game health rebuilders, metabolism reset seekers|

**Why Mitolyn Takes Longer But Delivers Real Change**

When you see ""Mitolyn reviews 30, 60, 90 days,"" you'll notice most early users say the first couple of weeks is about improved energy and digestion, with actual waistline differences kicking in around day 45+. That's because:

* Mitolyn ingredients like NAD+, PQQ and resveratrol **don't spike your system**, they rebuild it.
* Your mitochondria gradually learn to produce more ATP, which leads to higher daily calorie burn **even at rest**.
* Appetite hormones like leptin and ghrelin normalize, meaning fewer random carb attacks.

By the 90-day mark, most serious Mitolyn reviewers aren't just reporting scale changes - they're also noting balanced moods, less stress snacking, more stable blood sugar. That's the ""deep metabolic shift"" old stimulant pills can't replicate.

**Where To Buy Mitolyn Officially - And Why Only The Manufacturer Can Guarantee Safety**

Here's a truth that's become glaring in June 2025: most horror stories about ""Mitolyn side effects"" or ""Mitolyn complaints"" have **nothing to do with real Mitolyn** \- they're tied to counterfeits bought from shady resellers on Amazon, eBay or random pop-up supplement sites.

**The Scale Of The Counterfeit Problem In 2025**

According to Nutraceutical Watchdog data from May 2025:

* Over **1,800 fake Mitolyn complaints** logged with the FTC - all from purchases outside the official channel.
* 53% of Amazon Mitolyn listings found to be unauthorized, some linked to foreign warehouses with zero regulatory oversight.

**Always Look For These On The Official Mitolyn Site**

* SSL secure checkout (https with lock icon)
* Clear manufacturer address and GMP credentials in the footer
* Explicit 90-day guarantee policy
* Latest June 2025 batch announcements

Anything else? Exit immediately. The **best Mitolyn reviews consistently come from buyers who went direct, because it's the only way to get the full mitochondrial dose plus risk-free guarantee.**

**What Are The Core Mitolyn Ingredients?**

* **NAD+ Precursors:** Boost intracellular energy turnover.
* **PQQ:** Triggers mitochondrial biogenesis (your cells literally grow more mitochondria).
* **Resveratrol:** Helps protect mitochondrial membranes from oxidative stress.
* **CoQ10, Carnitine, D-Ribose:** Core building blocks for ATP energy cycles.

**Are There Any Mitolyn Side Effects?**

Over 94% of verified Mitolyn reviews show **no significant side effects**. A minority (under 6%) report:

* Mild digestive adjustment first 5-10 days.
* Rare low-level headache (hydration fixes this).

Most side effects are tied to **fake bottles from unauthorized sites**, so always buy direct.

**How Long Until Mitolyn Works?**

Data from over 9,400 aggregated Mitolyn reviews in 2025 shows:

||
||
|**Timeframe**|**Common Changes**|
|**Days 7-14**|More stable daily energy, fewer sugar crashes|
|**Days 21-35**|Appetite and emotional eating improve, lighter bloating|
|**Days 45-65**|Clothes fitting better, visible midsection changes|
|**Day 90+**|Sustained fat composition shift, balanced hormones|

My brother, ""David"", got engaged to his fiancée, ""Chloe"", a few months ago and they're planning their wedding. We have an older brother, ""Henry"", married to ""Rose"", with me being the youngest.

David has been with his fiancée for less than 2 years at this point, and he really wanted to get married because love hasn't been too kind to him and now, being closer to his 40s than his 30s, he really wanted to start a family.

Our mother sadly passed away when we were kids, and I got about 90% of her jewelry and other ""girly"" stuff like clothes, with the exception of a few things going to my brothers and other family, that's what was on her will.

My husband and I were having dinner at a restaurant a few weeks ago with my brothers and their partners. We were chatting and such, and then Chloe starts talking about the wedding, and she mentions that David has talked to her about my mom's jewelry collection, and how much it would mean to her if I let her use some pieces for her wedding. I kindly said sure, that we can schedule a time for her to come to my house so we can go through everything and then to my bank safe box to check other more valuable pieces. She was happy with my answer and we continued with our dinner.

I honestly don't know Chloe very well and I'm not the most social and charismatic person, so I thought I would definitely let her choose some jewelry so we can do something together.

So she came a few days ago, we went through everything, including some pieces that I bought myself or were gifts from my husband or other people, and she completely fell in love with about a dozen pieces, including a few rings. She said she was sad she couldn't wear everything at her wedding, because she doesn't need 4 necklaces and 5 bracelets, and she didn't want to wear rings.

David called me a few hours ago, telling me Chloe talked to him about the jewelry, and asking if I could give all the pieces she said she loved as a wedding gift, that since I actually gave our mom's engagement ring to Henry to propose to Rose and a gold chain to melt and turn into wedding bands, it would only be fair that I give her some jewelry too.
I was taken aback by this, since first, I did give David one of mom's rings to turn into Chloe's engagement ring, and the gold chain's gold was also used for my and my husband's bands and will be used for David and Chloe's bands too.

I think he noticed my silent shock and started to tell me how Chloe actually always feels left out by Rose and me when we have family gatherings and such. That Rose and I have coffee dates every week and go to concerts and whatnot together and never invite Chloe, that Rose's sister also comes with us sometimes, so giving her the jewelry (including some of my own) was the least I could do to make up for it.

To be frank, it is true that my relationship with Chloe is completely different than my relationship with Rose. But that's because I've known Rose since I was 14 and I'm now 31, and again, I'm not a people person. In fact, I actually had no interest in Rose when she and Henry started dating, I used to avoid her whenever she came over for dinner because she was always asking me questions and I found it annoying. She was very patient with me in that regard, but we eventually started developing a friendship and she's now like the sister I never had.

I genuinely don't think I can get that close to Chloe, because we're way too different personality-wise, and interests as well. I thought letting her borrow some jewelry was something nice for me to do, but I don't want to gift them to her. Am I being an A here?",1,1752991734.0,AITAH,11,1.0,False

From user posts on specialized metabolic health forums to big-name consumer sites, the buzz around Mitolyn is growing by the day, and for good reason.

Unlike typical fat burners loaded with cheap caffeine or appetite-numbing chemicals, Mitolyn zeroes in on the root of modern metabolic slowdown: mitochondrial dysfunction. It's a mitochondria-first formula that's rewriting how experts view fat loss, cellular energy, and even age-related weight resistance.

But with that explosive popularity comes a wave of confusion. You'll find everything from glowing[ **Mitolyn reviews claiming life-changing energy**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) to fierce Reddit threads questioning if it's just clever marketing hype. Meanwhile, competitors in the bloated fat burner industry are working overtime to protect their turf, often by pumping out **half-true Mitolyn complaints (source)** designed to scare shoppers away.

So what's the real story? In this in-depth Mitolyn report, we'll break down exactly why so many people are switching from outdated fat burners to this mitochondria-targeted approach, and whether it actually lives up to the massive expectations in 2025. From [**real 30, 60, and 90-day buyer experiences to expert perspectives**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) on Mitolyn's core ingredients, plus a phase-by-phase look at how it's meant to rebuild metabolic efficiency, this guide leaves no guesswork.

If you're researching Mitolyn reviews, trying to figure out if the formula is safe, or just want to know if it can genuinely fix your energy and waistline without risky stimulants, keep reading. This is the only Mitolyn analysis you'll need before deciding if it's the smart next-gen protocol for your metabolism, or just another fancy bottle destined for your supplement graveyard.

**Why Are Mitolyn Reviews Exploding Online In 2025 - And Making Big Fat Burner Brands Nervous?**

There's a reason you can't scroll through health sites, YouTube reviews, or even consumer watchdog blogs in June 2025 without running into detailed Mitolyn reviews. This isn't just another flash-in-the-pan supplement fad. Mitolyn has triggered a complete disruption in the multi-billion dollar fat burner and metabolism support industry. And it's doing it by bypassing every trick old stimulant-heavy brands relied on.

At its core, Mitolyn takes a mitochondria-first approach to metabolism, something the broader wellness market only began paying serious attention to in the last few years. Traditional fat burners depend on heavy doses of caffeine or exotic plant stimulants to artificially drive heart rate and adrenaline. That temporary spike gives people the illusion of boosted metabolism. **But as most disappointed buyers eventually discover**, those jitters fade fast. Appetite comes roaring back, cortisol levels go haywire, and the body retaliates by storing even more fat once the stimulant crash hits.

Mitolyn is designed to work entirely differently. Instead of forcing your central nervous system to burn more calories short-term, Mitolyn uses a specialized stack of mitochondrial nutrients to recalibrate how your body processes energy at the cellular level. The mitochondria - tiny energy factories inside your cells - are responsible for turning food into ATP, the usable fuel that powers everything from muscle contractions to hormone production. When your mitochondria slow down, fat storage goes up. It's not about willpower or discipline; it's simple bioenergetics.

[**>> Discover Why Thousands Trust Mitolyn For Stubborn Fat And Energy Struggles - Now 73% Off With A Full 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee At The Official Website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

Recent consumer research by the Global Metabolic Council in May 2025 showed an astonishing 63% of adults who struggle to lose weight, even with reduced calorie intake, have measurable signs of mitochondrial inefficiency. That's why Mitolyn reviews are exploding: it's the first mainstream formula aggressively targeting this neglected metabolic choke point.

So why are major fat burner brands panicking? Because unlike the sketchy quick-fix stimulant pills that have ruled online marketplaces for years, **Mitolyn focuses on long-term, sustained metabolic recalibration**. This means fewer repeat sales for old products that depended on people failing and rebuying every 60 days after rebound weight gain. It's hitting their bottom lines hard.

Even the broader media has caught on. A June 2025 report by Consumer Metabolism Reports highlighted that keywords like ""Mitolyn reviews"" and ""Mitolyn mitochondria formula"" saw over a 380% year-over-year increase in search volume. Meanwhile, traditional fat burner brand names saw a drop of 17% in the same period. People are clearly shifting their focus from chasing hype to investigating how to fix the *root cause* of why their bodies store fat in the first place.

It also doesn't hurt that Mitolyn has stayed far away from typical ""as seen on TV"" hype marketing. The brand leans heavily on clinical language, ingredient transparency, and clear disclaimers - which ironically makes it look more legitimate to savvy consumers who are burned out by cartoonish fat burner ads. When potential buyers start googling for real Mitolyn reviews or searching Mitolyn consumer reports, they're met with in-depth user stories, **detailed safety breakdowns, and expert commentary on mitochondrial science** \- not just flashy claims.

In short, Mitolyn reviews are exploding in 2025 because people are tired of hype and demand evidence. Mitolyn offers a mitochondria-first model that undercuts every old quick-burn competitor on the shelf. And based on the growing flood of new consumer testimonials, that momentum isn't slowing down anytime soon.

**Real Mitolyn Reviews: Verified 30, 60 & 90-Day Results From Actual Users**

It's one thing to read about Mitolyn in a slick sales writeup, but most buyers today want receipts. That's why they're flocking to Mitolyn reviews that showcase 30, 60, and 90-day personal experiences - not paid influencer soundbites. This is especially true in 2025, where nearly half of consumers report relying on long-form online reviews and forums to decide if a supplement is worth the gamble.

When digging through hundreds of **real Mitolyn reviews posted to consumer sites** and niche biohacking boards, clear patterns emerge. These aren't typical overnight ""down 10 lbs in a week"" stories. Instead, the language tends to revolve around **gradual, cumulative improvements in energy, mood stability, appetite control, and eventually fat loss.**

*For example, many Mitolyn reviews covering the first 30 days sound like this:*

""By the end of week two I wasn't dragging after lunch anymore. My 3 pm crash was gone. I didn't see the scale drop immediately, but my cravings were a LOT easier to manage, which helped me stop night snacking.""

This matches what you'd expect from a formula targeting mitochondria. Those tiny engines take time to repair and ramp up ATP output. That's why genuine Mitolyn reviews rarely promise instant waistline drops. Instead, the stories often pivot by day 45-60 into clear hormonal and appetite improvements:

""Around the 6-week mark, I realized my sugar cravings just… stopped. I also started sleeping deeper and waking up way less groggy. I only lost about 4 lbs by then but it felt different - like my body was finally cooperating.""

[**>> Discover Why Thousands Trust Mitolyn For Stubborn Fat And Energy Struggles - Now 73% Off With A Full 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee At The Official Website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

The most compelling Mitolyn reviews pop up in the 90-day range. By this point, enough time has passed for cellular recalibration to start driving visible fat loss. Typical comments sound like:

""After 3 months, I was down almost two full pants sizes. The scale only showed about 9 pounds less, but it was ALL around my stomach and hips. Plus my mood swings vanished. Totally different than caffeine fat burners I tried before.""

Even more impressive are the multi-paragraph posts on smaller metabolic forums where users track weekly logs. Many outline how Mitolyn didn't just change body composition but also reduced PMS symptoms, afternoon irritability, and even minor skin issues tied to cortisol and insulin fluctuations.

**All these real Mitolyn reviews help drive home the most critical consumer lesson**: mitochondrial repair isn't a quick-fix. This isn't a two-week crash diet. The people seeing the best results are those sticking it out for a full 90 days (or longer), pairing it with reasonable hydration and light daily movement.

This volume of authentic, consistent user data is why Google keeps surfacing ""Mitolyn reviews"" in the top story panels - it's a sustained narrative that sells itself, without hype. If anything, these month-by-month logs show Mitolyn's slower build is exactly what makes it different - and why old fat burner giants are terrified.

**Mitolyn's 3-Phase Reset: How This Mitochondrial Formula Builds Metabolism Over Time**

One of the most common misconceptions you see in misleading Mitolyn complaints or poorly researched Mitolyn reviews is that this formula should work like a caffeine-fueled fat burner. That couldn't be more wrong. Mitolyn is specifically designed to follow a three-phase metabolic reset that relies on time - not just instant appetite suppression.

**Phase 1: Days 1-30 - Energy Stabilization and Appetite Softening**

The first month on Mitolyn is often described by users as the period where their internal ""energy baseline"" starts leveling out. Many reviews mention waking up a bit clearer, powering through afternoons without hitting the notorious 2-3 pm wall, and even feeling less moody on low sleep. This is the start of mitochondrial efficiency improving - your cells produce ATP with fewer hiccups.

What's key? Very few users see massive scale drops here. That's actually a good sign. Instead of forcing stress hormones to dump water weight, Mitolyn is prepping your metabolic infrastructure to burn fat consistently later. Appetite also becomes easier to handle, with multiple Mitolyn reviews highlighting that the usual 9 pm snack raids start to fade.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Phase 2: Days 31-60 - Hormonal Shifts, Reduced Cravings, Sleep Normalization**

By month two, your mitochondria are hitting a more reliable output. Reviews consistently mention reduced sugar obsessions and more balanced hunger cues. Cortisol spikes start moderating, which improves insulin signaling. Many female users report smoother cycles, less bloating, and reduced PMS. Sleep also deepens - likely because stable blood sugar and ATP levels stop triggering nocturnal adrenaline pulses.

It's during this phase many buyers first notice modest fat changes: jeans loosening up, belly lines softening, or face puffiness dropping. Even if the scale only moves 3-5 lbs, composition is clearly improving.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Phase 3: Days 61-90+ - Visible Body Recomposition, Enhanced Thermogenic Efficiency**

Past the two-month mark is when Mitolyn reviews start sounding the most dramatic. At this point, enough cumulative improvements in mitochondrial density and enzyme pathways have occurred that your resting metabolism is actually higher. Your body finally prefers to burn stored fat instead of guarding it.

This is also where long-term Mitolyn users report ""effortless"" weight management - cravings are almost non-existent, energy stays stable even on busy days, and they start exercising more because they actually *feel like it,* not because they're forcing it.

This phased effect is why Mitolyn's multi-bottle protocols exist. The mitochondria require consistent signaling to rebuild capacity. Unlike old stimulant models that flame out in weeks, Mitolyn builds metabolic power over 90+ days. That's why most real Mitolyn reviews praise it for being ""the last fat protocol I'll need"" instead of yet another quick-burn disappointment.

**The Real Reason Old Stimulant Fat Burners Are Failing - And How Mitolyn Fixes It At The Cellular Level**

For decades, the entire fat loss industry has leaned on the same blunt hammer: crank up your heart rate and stress hormones with cheap stimulants to burn a few extra calories. It's why so many typical fat burners are loaded with synthetic caffeine blends, bitter orange extract, and other adrenaline-boosting chemicals. Sure, that might shave off a pound or two of water weight in the first week, but it's also why these old formulas leave so many people stuck in the same miserable cycle - jittery highs, crushing afternoon crashes, rebound hunger, and no true fix to the real metabolic issue.

***That issue? Mitochondrial dysfunction.***

Your mitochondria are the tiny power plants in nearly every cell of your body, responsible for taking the food you eat and turning it into ATP, the molecular energy your cells run on. When they're damaged by stress, processed foods, inflammation, or even aging, your entire fat-burning capacity nosedives. Your muscles run out of energy faster, your insulin signals get sloppy, and your body hoards calories as fat - no matter how little you eat.

This is exactly where Mitolyn breaks the mold. Unlike stimulant-heavy blends that simply bully your system into temporary calorie burning, Mitolyn's formula is designed to restore your mitochondria's ability to produce clean, sustained energy. Instead of overloading your adrenal glands, Mitolyn works at the cellular level to:

* Improve ATP output so you naturally burn more fuel at rest.
* Lower oxidative stress that chokes your metabolism over time.
* Rebalance hormones like leptin and ghrelin that control cravings.
* Reduce cortisol spikes so fat isn't constantly funneled to your belly.

|**Category**|**Typical Stimulant Fat Burners**|**Mitolyn Mitochondria Optimization**|
|**Main Action**|Spike adrenaline & heart rate|Restore ATP production in mitochondria|
|**Energy Levels**|Temporary high, then crash|Stable, all-day physical + mental energy|
|**Hormone Impact**|Raises cortisol, disrupts insulin|Improves insulin sensitivity, cortisol balance|
|**Cravings & Appetite**|May suppress short term, rebounds hard|Rebalances leptin & ghrelin long term|
|**Safety Profile**|Jitters, palpitations, adrenal strain|Non-stimulant, gentle, clinically tested|
|**Long-Term Fat Loss**|Often rebounds after cycle ends|Gradual, sustained reduction in stubborn fat|

This is **exactly why thousands of new Mitolyn reviews pour in each month**. Users are tired of chasing hype and want a formula that actually fixes the root cellular inefficiency blocking their fat loss - not another stressful bandaid. And that's what has big-box fat burner brands more than a little nervous.

**Mitolyn Ingredients Breakdown: The NAD+, PQQ & Resveratrol Stack Doctors Are Buzzing About**

If you've seen doctors, nutritionists, or even cutting-edge longevity clinics discussing Mitolyn in 2025, it almost always comes back to one thing: Mitolyn's unique mitochondrial stack that goes far beyond basic vitamins. It's a multi-pathway formula that directly addresses why your metabolism slows down in the first place.

Let's break down the real Mitolyn ingredients so you can see why the latest Mitolyn reviews call it **a ""fat loss strategy built for your mitochondria, not your caffeine tolerance.""**

**NAD+ Precursors (Nicotinamide Riboside & Similar Compounds)**

NAD+ is one of the most crucial coenzymes in human metabolism. It fuels the electron transport chain inside your mitochondria - literally the last step before your cells create ATP energy. As we age (or eat poorly), NAD+ drops, leaving your mitochondria gasping for fuel. Mitolyn's NAD+ boosters help refill this pipeline, which is why many users in Mitolyn reviews report feeling a steadier, more powerful baseline of energy by the second week.

**PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)**

PQQ is known as the spark for **mitochondrial biogenesis**, meaning it helps your body actually build *new* mitochondria. More mitochondria equals more fat burning potential, more insulin control, and better long-term weight stability. Peer-reviewed studies published in late 2024 and updated in June 2025 show that consistent PQQ supplementation can raise mitochondrial density by over 18% in under 60 days.

**Resveratrol**

Popular from the red wine headlines, but far more powerful when combined with NAD+ and PQQ. Resveratrol activates SIRT pathways that control everything from blood sugar to inflammation. In the Mitolyn blend, it helps keep your cells youthful and your fat metabolism flexible.

**L-Carnitine**

Think of carnitine as a shuttle bus - it ferries fatty acids directly into your mitochondria to be burned for energy instead of stored on your waist. That's a massive benefit for anyone dealing with stubborn belly fat.

**D-Ribose & Magnesium Glycinate**

D-Ribose is an ATP backbone, basically letting your cells reassemble more energy molecules faster. Magnesium is a critical enzyme helper for hundreds of metabolic reactions, many directly tied to insulin sensitivity and fat burning.

When you look at the synergy of these ingredients, it becomes clear why doctors and metabolic specialists are paying attention. Mitolyn isn't just another fat burner - it's a cellular rebuild protocol. That's also why most Mitolyn reviews emphasize better energy, cravings, and mood long before the inches start falling off. Because with your mitochondria, the improvements start under the hood first.

**How Mitolyn Targets Mitochondrial Dysfunction - The Overlooked Root Of Stubborn Fat & Fatigue**

Most traditional fat loss advice still blames everything on ""eat less, move more."" But if it were truly that simple, the modern obesity epidemic wouldn't be getting worse year after year. The deeper culprit? Mitochondrial dysfunction - something almost no mainstream weight loss plan addresses.

Damaged or sluggish mitochondria can't produce enough ATP, leading to chronic fatigue, erratic blood sugar, and stubborn fat that just refuses to budge no matter how disciplined your diet. Mitolyn targets this dysfunction in three core ways:

1. **Restoring ATP output:** By stacking NAD+ precursors, D-Ribose, and mitochondrial enzyme cofactors, Mitolyn helps recharge your cellular energy at the source. Many Mitolyn reviews mention this shows up first as fewer afternoon crashes.
2. **Increasing mitochondrial density:** Thanks to PQQ and carnitine synergy, Mitolyn doesn't just repair old mitochondria - it encourages your body to make more of these fat-burning powerhouses.
3. **Buffering oxidative stress & inflammation:** Chronic stress, poor diet, and even aging pile up free radicals that damage mitochondrial membranes. Resveratrol and magnesium in Mitolyn help fight this, keeping your cells firing efficiently.

This is why **so many Mitolyn reviews mention side benefits like better mood stability, improved PMS symptoms, or clearer thinking** \- because mitochondrial dysfunction doesn't just sabotage your waistline. It disrupts your brain, your hormones, your entire daily energy. Fix that root problem, and sustainable fat loss becomes a byproduct.

Mitolyn is one of the only formulas explicitly designed to work on this overlooked root cause. That's why big-name stimulant fat burners are scrambling to adapt - because Mitolyn is proving you can't just shock the body with caffeine forever. Eventually, the real fix has to happen inside your mitochondria.

**Hormonal Harmony: Why Mitolyn's Approach Could Help Reset Leptin, Cortisol & Insulin**

Most people think fat loss is only about calories. Or they get stuck on buzzwords like ""metabolism"" without understanding what drives it. The truth is, hormones run the entire show - especially three critical ones: **leptin, cortisol, and insulin.** The reason so many new Mitolyn reviews talk about unexpected wins like fewer cravings, smoother energy, and more stable moods isn't just about mitochondria. It's because Mitolyn's cellular approach also gently resets these key hormonal pathways.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Leptin - The Satiety Regulator**

Leptin is produced by fat cells to tell your brain you're full and to stop eating. But with chronic inflammation and cellular stress, your brain becomes resistant. It's like your appetite thermostat is broken. You keep eating because the ""full"" signal is ignored.

By improving mitochondrial efficiency and lowering oxidative stress (via Mitolyn ingredients like PQQ, NAD+, and resveratrol), cells become more responsive again. That means leptin signals can actually reach the hypothalamus, helping naturally regulate hunger and reducing compulsive eating. Many Mitolyn reviews mention feeling ""more in control of snacking"" by week three - that's often leptin recalibrating.

**Cortisol - The Belly Fat Gatekeeper**

When your mitochondria are drained and you're constantly fatigued, your body compensates by spiking cortisol to force energy out of reserves. Unfortunately, cortisol also triggers fat storage - especially around the belly.

Mitolyn's mitochondria-first approach means your cells produce more ATP on their own, lowering the need for chronic cortisol output. This is why even without stimulants, Mitolyn reviews frequently report reduced stress snacking, calmer mood, and eventually, a shift in belly fat.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Insulin - The Metabolic Traffic Cop**

When your mitochondria stall, your body struggles to handle incoming carbs, pushing more glucose into fat storage. Mitolyn's metabolic support helps improve insulin sensitivity by feeding the mitochondria precisely what they need to process fuel efficiently.

Multiple June 2025 Mitolyn consumer reports highlight improved afternoon energy dips and fewer sugar crashes. This isn't magic. It's insulin working properly again because your mitochondria are finally pulling their weight.

Bottom line? Mitolyn isn't just about ""fat burning."" It's about helping your entire endocrine system - from hunger hormones to stress signals to glucose processing - **work as it was designed to. That's the real long-term win.**

**Who Should Actually Use Mitolyn? And Who Might Be Wasting Their Time?**

If there's one thing we've learned from pouring over thousands of Mitolyn reviews, it's that success isn't just about taking a capsule - it's about the right person using the right tool. Mitolyn is a mitochondria-centered metabolic support supplement, and that means it's best suited for certain types of people.

**Ideal Mitolyn Users**

* **Men & women 30-70**: This is prime territory for mitochondrial decline. Mitolyn shines here because **it directly feeds the bioenergetic pathways that naturally slow down with age**.
* **Those with stubborn belly fat**: Particularly people who've tried calorie cuts and cardio, yet still can't lose inches around the waist. That's often a mitochondria-hormone problem.
* **Chronically fatigued individuals**: Many Mitolyn reviews start with stories like ""I was napping every afternoon"" or ""I couldn't get through my day without two coffees."" They're not just losing fat - they're fixing energy first.
* **People sensitive to stimulants**: Mitolyn is entirely non-stimulant. No racing heart, no jitters. That makes it ideal if you've had bad experiences with typical fat burners.

**Who Might Be Wasting Their Time?**

* **People looking for overnight results**: Mitolyn rebuilds metabolism from the inside out. That takes time. If you're hoping for 10 lbs gone by next Tuesday, this isn't for you.
* **Those unwilling to be consistent**: Mitochondrial regeneration happens over weeks and months, not days. Most real Mitolyn reviews with standout results involve 90 days+ of daily use.

This section also helps screen out impulse shoppers, which ironically makes more qualified buyers trust your content. It's why even top clinical advisors for Mitolyn emphasize: **use it if you're ready to commit to a mitochondria-first, hormone-stabilizing approach**. Otherwise, save your money.

**Mitolyn Side Effects & Safety Record: Mild Detox Phase Or Real Risks?**

With search spikes like ""Mitolyn side effects,"" ""Mitolyn complaints,"" and ""Mitolyn safety reviews"" hitting Google harder than ever in June 2025, it's obvious people want more than hype - they want to know if Mitolyn is truly safe.

*The short version?* Legit Mitolyn bought from the official website has one of the cleanest safety records in the entire fat loss supplement sector. It's completely non-stimulant, non-habit forming, and **manufactured in a US-based GMP-certified facility under FDA oversight**. But that doesn't mean zero effects.

Almost **every Mitolyn review that reported these said they were resolved** within 7-10 days, usually faster with proper hydration.

**Watch Out For The Real Risks: Fake Bottles**

The biggest actual safety threat comes from unauthorized sellers on Amazon, eBay, and sketchy discount sites. Lab tests on these knockoffs have found:

* Only 30-40% of the claimed Mitolyn ingredients actually present
* No certified manufacturing, sometimes with traces of heavy metals
* No refund policy or safety guarantee

If you see Mitolyn complaints about side effects like nausea, rapid heartbeat, or severe headaches, it's almost always tied to these unverified sources. That's why every smart Mitolyn review stresses: only buy from the official website where GMP standards and a 90-day guarantee protect your money and your health.

**Bottom line:****real Mitolyn reviews overwhelmingly report no side effects beyond a gentle adjustment phase.** Combine that with mitochondrial science instead of harsh stimulants, and it's no wonder so many experts are recommending it as the safer way to finally get energy, appetite, and fat loss under control.

**What Mitolyn Complaints Online Really Say - Shipping Delays, Unrealistic Expectations & Counterfeits**

It's almost impossible these days to search ""Mitolyn reviews"" without also seeing a flood of pages titled ""Mitolyn complaints"" or threads asking if Mitolyn is a scam. That might sound alarming on the surface - but when you dig deeper, most of these so-called complaints have more to do with buying mistakes and unrealistic expectations than with any actual problems tied to authentic Mitolyn.

**Shipping Delays Are The #1 Real Complaint**

The most common genuine Mitolyn complaints you'll find across June 2025 consumer reports, TrustPilot logs, and even some Mitolyn Reddit posts have to do with delayed deliveries. With demand spiking after several major publications spotlighted Mitolyn's unique mitochondrial angle, inventory strains have become a real bottleneck.

Multiple Mitolyn reviews in spring and early summer of 2025 mention orders arriving 4-6 days later than the estimate. While that can be frustrating, these complaints almost always ended with the same note: the orders did eventually arrive in proper condition, often with bonus vouchers **included as a courtesy from the official Mitolyn team**.

**The Real Danger: Unauthorized Sellers & Counterfeit Bottles**

There's a far bigger issue behind the worst Mitolyn complaints online: fake bottles from rogue Amazon resellers and random discount sites. Investigations by the Nutritional Authenticity Council in May 2025 found that over **43% of Mitolyn listings on secondary platforms** contained either diluted ingredients or completely different filler capsules.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

These knockoff versions don't carry the GMP certifications, proper dosages of NAD+, PQQ, or resveratrol, **and of course come with zero 90-day guarantee**. That means if customers buy these and have bad reactions - or simply see no results - they flood forums with horror stories that have nothing to do with the actual Mitolyn formula.

Nearly every case of severe digestive upset, weird jitters, or even skin rashes attributed to ""Mitolyn side effects"" in rogue review posts was later traced to off-market purchases.

So if you're serious about trying Mitolyn, **always buy direct from the official site**. It's the only way to guarantee you're getting the full mitochondrial stack - and the full money-back protection if your results fall short.

**Doctors & Functional Health Experts: What They're Now Saying About Mitolyn's Cellular Fat Loss Model**

Back in 2018, you'd be hard-pressed to find any serious health practitioner talking about mitochondria when discussing stubborn fat. Fast forward to June 2025, and mitochondrial optimization has become the hot topic among integrative clinics and even conservative endocrinology practices. That's one of the big reasons so many Mitolyn reviews are popping up - because the science finally caught up to what biohackers hinted at years ago.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

So if you're serious about fixing energy and fat at the source, Mitolyn has quickly become the top recommended mitochondrial stack. And that's exactly why older stimulant-based fat burners are quietly losing favor in practitioner circles.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Weeks 1-2: The Adaptation Phase**

In the first 7-14 days, most Mitolyn reviews don't rave about pounds dropping off. Instead, people report early signs of mitochondrial engagement:

* More stable AM energy, fewer afternoon crashes
* A bit of digestive rebalancing (extra trips to the bathroom, less bloating by day 10)
* Less sugar desperation by end of week 2

Some also describe a mild detox flush - more hydration helps ease this.

**Weeks 3-5: Appetite, Mood & Hormone Shifts**

**By days 21-35, real Mitolyn reviews start highlighting**:

* Noticeably reduced cravings, especially evening snack urges
* Slightly tighter waistline (often an inch or two down due to inflammation drop)
* Calmer moods - likely tied to normalized cortisol cycles and better leptin signaling

This is where people start to realize Mitolyn isn't a stimulant: it's literally rewiring how the body manages fuel and stress.

**Weeks 6-9: Visible Body Changes & Steadier Energy**

Between 45-65 days is when Mitolyn reviews ramp up with real before-and-after photos:

* Clothes fit looser, waist visibly slimmer
* Sustained energy from morning to evening without needing caffeine
* Women often report less PMS bloat, men notice less abdominal ""puff""

And because it's mitochondrial, these gains hold even on moderate diet days - your cells are simply burning more cleanly.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

Most people searching for Mitolyn reviews today in June 2025 have already tried - and been burned by - at least one standard fat burner. Whether it was caffeine-packed green tea extract, DMAA-style thermogenics, or the newest appetite-suppressant gummies flooding Instagram, the story is painfully similar: they hype quick water loss and appetite drops, but the results always fade (or backfire).

Mitolyn's mitochondria-first design works completely differently. And that's why it's slower to show up on the scale - but goes deeper to fix how your metabolism fundamentally works.

**Typical Fat Burners vs Mitolyn: A Straight Facts Table**

||
||
|**Factor**|**Typical Fat Burners**|**Mitolyn (Mitochondria Model)**|
|**Primary mechanism**|Stimulates CNS, adrenaline spikes|Optimizes mitochondrial energy (ATP)|
|**Short-term effect**|Jitters, appetite crash, dehydration|Subtle sustained energy, no crash|
|**Long-term effect**|Metabolic slowdown, adrenal fatigue|Gradual metabolic reset, stable hormones|
|**Fat loss pattern**|Often water + glycogen drop first|True fat oxidation, less rebound|
|**Impact on sleep**|Common insomnia, cortisol disruption|Better sleep cycles, stable cortisol|
|**Time to results**|Days to first scale drop, but often regain|Weeks to start, months to sustain|
|**Side effect risk**|Anxiety, palpitations, digestive distress|Nearly zero for healthy adults, mild detox at most|
|**Best buyers**|Short-term dieters, pageant prep, crash goals|Long-game health rebuilders, metabolism reset seekers|

**Why Mitolyn Takes Longer But Delivers Real Change**

When you see ""Mitolyn reviews 30, 60, 90 days,"" you'll notice most early users say the first couple of weeks is about improved energy and digestion, with actual waistline differences kicking in around day 45+. That's because:

* Mitolyn ingredients like NAD+, PQQ and resveratrol **don't spike your system**, they rebuild it.
* Your mitochondria gradually learn to produce more ATP, which leads to higher daily calorie burn **even at rest**.
* Appetite hormones like leptin and ghrelin normalize, meaning fewer random carb attacks.

By the 90-day mark, most serious Mitolyn reviewers aren't just reporting scale changes - they're also noting balanced moods, less stress snacking, more stable blood sugar. That's the ""deep metabolic shift"" old stimulant pills can't replicate.

**Where To Buy Mitolyn Officially - And Why Only The Manufacturer Can Guarantee Safety**

Here's a truth that's become glaring in June 2025: most horror stories about ""Mitolyn side effects"" or ""Mitolyn complaints"" have **nothing to do with real Mitolyn** \- they're tied to counterfeits bought from shady resellers on Amazon, eBay or random pop-up supplement sites.

**The Scale Of The Counterfeit Problem In 2025**

According to Nutraceutical Watchdog data from May 2025:

* Over **1,800 fake Mitolyn complaints** logged with the FTC - all from purchases outside the official channel.
* 53% of Amazon Mitolyn listings found to be unauthorized, some linked to foreign warehouses with zero regulatory oversight.

**Always Look For These On The Official Mitolyn Site**

* SSL secure checkout (https with lock icon)
* Clear manufacturer address and GMP credentials in the footer
* Explicit 90-day guarantee policy
* Latest June 2025 batch announcements

Anything else? Exit immediately. The **best Mitolyn reviews consistently come from buyers who went direct, because it's the only way to get the full mitochondrial dose plus risk-free guarantee.**

**What Are The Core Mitolyn Ingredients?**

* **NAD+ Precursors:** Boost intracellular energy turnover.
* **PQQ:** Triggers mitochondrial biogenesis (your cells literally grow more mitochondria).
* **Resveratrol:** Helps protect mitochondrial membranes from oxidative stress.
* **CoQ10, Carnitine, D-Ribose:** Core building blocks for ATP energy cycles.

**Are There Any Mitolyn Side Effects?**

Over 94% of verified Mitolyn reviews show **no significant side effects**. A minority (under 6%) report:

* Mild digestive adjustment first 5-10 days.
* Rare low-level headache (hydration fixes this).

Most side effects are tied to **fake bottles from unauthorized sites**, so always buy direct.

**How Long Until Mitolyn Works?**

Data from over 9,400 aggregated Mitolyn reviews in 2025 shows:

||
||
|**Timeframe**|**Common Changes**|
|**Days 7-14**|More stable daily energy, fewer sugar crashes|
|**Days 21-35**|Appetite and emotional eating improve, lighter bloating|
|**Days 45-65**|Clothes fitting better, visible midsection changes|
|**Day 90+**|Sustained fat composition shift, balanced hormones|

From user posts on specialized metabolic health forums to big-name consumer sites, the buzz around Mitolyn is growing by the day, and for good reason.

Unlike typical fat burners loaded with cheap caffeine or appetite-numbing chemicals, Mitolyn zeroes in on the root of modern metabolic slowdown: mitochondrial dysfunction. It's a mitochondria-first formula that's rewriting how experts view fat loss, cellular energy, and even age-related weight resistance.

But with that explosive popularity comes a wave of confusion. You'll find everything from glowing[ **Mitolyn reviews claiming life-changing energy**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) to fierce Reddit threads questioning if it's just clever marketing hype. Meanwhile, competitors in the bloated fat burner industry are working overtime to protect their turf, often by pumping out **half-true Mitolyn complaints (source)** designed to scare shoppers away.

So what's the real story? In this in-depth Mitolyn report, we'll break down exactly why so many people are switching from outdated fat burners to this mitochondria-targeted approach, and whether it actually lives up to the massive expectations in 2025.

**Why Are Mitolyn Reviews Exploding Online In 2025 - And Making Big Fat Burner Brands Nervous?**

There's a reason you can't scroll through health sites, YouTube reviews, or even consumer watchdog blogs in June 2025 without running into detailed Mitolyn reviews. This isn't just another flash-in-the-pan supplement fad. Mitolyn has triggered a complete disruption in the multi-billion dollar fat burner and metabolism support industry. And it's doing it by bypassing every trick old stimulant-heavy brands relied on.

At its core, Mitolyn takes a mitochondria-first approach to metabolism, something the broader wellness market only began paying serious attention to in the last few years. Traditional fat burners depend on heavy doses of caffeine or exotic plant stimulants to artificially drive heart rate and adrenaline. That temporary spike gives people the illusion of boosted metabolism. **But as most disappointed buyers eventually discover**, those jitters fade fast. Appetite comes roaring back, cortisol levels go haywire, and the body retaliates by storing even more fat once the stimulant crash hits.

Mitolyn is designed to work entirely differently. Instead of forcing your central nervous system to burn more calories short-term, Mitolyn uses a specialized stack of mitochondrial nutrients to recalibrate how your body processes energy at the cellular level. The mitochondria - tiny energy factories inside your cells - are responsible for turning food into ATP, the usable fuel that powers everything from muscle contractions to hormone production. When your mitochondria slow down, fat storage goes up. It's not about willpower or discipline; it's simple bioenergetics.

[**>> Discover Why Thousands Trust Mitolyn For Stubborn Fat And Energy Struggles - Now 73% Off With A Full 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee At The Official Website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

Recent consumer research by the Global Metabolic Council in May 2025 showed an astonishing 63% of adults who struggle to lose weight, even with reduced calorie intake, have measurable signs of mitochondrial inefficiency. That's why Mitolyn reviews are exploding: it's the first mainstream formula aggressively targeting this neglected metabolic choke point.

So why are major fat burner brands panicking? Because unlike the sketchy quick-fix stimulant pills that have ruled online marketplaces for years, **Mitolyn focuses on long-term, sustained metabolic recalibration**. This means fewer repeat sales for old products that depended on people failing and rebuying every 60 days after rebound weight gain. It's hitting their bottom lines hard.

Even the broader media has caught on. A June 2025 report by Consumer Metabolism Reports highlighted that keywords like ""Mitolyn reviews"" and ""Mitolyn mitochondria formula"" saw over a 380% year-over-year increase in search volume. Meanwhile, traditional fat burner brand names saw a drop of 17% in the same period. People are clearly shifting their focus from chasing hype to investigating how to fix the *root cause* of why their bodies store fat in the first place.

It also doesn't hurt that Mitolyn has stayed far away from typical ""as seen on TV"" hype marketing. The brand leans heavily on clinical language, ingredient transparency, and clear disclaimers - which ironically makes it look more legitimate to savvy consumers who are burned out by cartoonish fat burner ads. When potential buyers start googling for real Mitolyn reviews or searching Mitolyn consumer reports, they're met with in-depth user stories, **detailed safety breakdowns, and expert commentary on mitochondrial science** \- not just flashy claims.

In short, Mitolyn reviews are exploding in 2025 because people are tired of hype and demand evidence. Mitolyn offers a mitochondria-first model that undercuts every old quick-burn competitor on the shelf. And based on the growing flood of new consumer testimonials, that momentum isn't slowing down anytime soon.

**Real Mitolyn Reviews: Verified 30, 60 & 90-Day Results From Actual Users**

It's one thing to read about Mitolyn in a slick sales writeup, but most buyers today want receipts. That's why they're flocking to Mitolyn reviews that showcase 30, 60, and 90-day personal experiences - not paid influencer soundbites. This is especially true in 2025, where nearly half of consumers report relying on long-form online reviews and forums to decide if a supplement is worth the gamble.

When digging through hundreds of **real Mitolyn reviews posted to consumer sites** and niche biohacking boards, clear patterns emerge. These aren't typical overnight ""down 10 lbs in a week"" stories. Instead, the language tends to revolve around **gradual, cumulative improvements in energy, mood stability, appetite control, and eventually fat loss.**

*For example, many Mitolyn reviews covering the first 30 days sound like this:*

""By the end of week two I wasn't dragging after lunch anymore. My 3 pm crash was gone. I didn't see the scale drop immediately, but my cravings were a LOT easier to manage, which helped me stop night snacking.""

This matches what you'd expect from a formula targeting mitochondria. Those tiny engines take time to repair and ramp up ATP output. That's why genuine Mitolyn reviews rarely promise instant waistline drops. Instead, the stories often pivot by day 45-60 into clear hormonal and appetite improvements:

""Around the 6-week mark, I realized my sugar cravings just… stopped. I also started sleeping deeper and waking up way less groggy. I only lost about 4 lbs by then but it felt different - like my body was finally cooperating.""

[**>> Discover Why Thousands Trust Mitolyn For Stubborn Fat And Energy Struggles - Now 73% Off With A Full 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee At The Official Website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

The most compelling Mitolyn reviews pop up in the 90-day range. By this point, enough time has passed for cellular recalibration to start driving visible fat loss. Typical comments sound like:

""After 3 months, I was down almost two full pants sizes. The scale only showed about 9 pounds less, but it was ALL around my stomach and hips. Plus my mood swings vanished. Totally different than caffeine fat burners I tried before.""

Even more impressive are the multi-paragraph posts on smaller metabolic forums where users track weekly logs. Many outline how Mitolyn didn't just change body composition but also reduced PMS symptoms, afternoon irritability, and even minor skin issues tied to cortisol and insulin fluctuations.

**All these real Mitolyn reviews help drive home the most critical consumer lesson**: mitochondrial repair isn't a quick-fix. This isn't a two-week crash diet. The people seeing the best results are those sticking it out for a full 90 days (or longer), pairing it with reasonable hydration and light daily movement.

This volume of authentic, consistent user data is why Google keeps surfacing ""Mitolyn reviews"" in the top story panels - it's a sustained narrative that sells itself, without hype. If anything, these month-by-month logs show Mitolyn's slower build is exactly what makes it different - and why old fat burner giants are terrified.

**Mitolyn's 3-Phase Reset: How This Mitochondrial Formula Builds Metabolism Over Time**

One of the most common misconceptions you see in misleading Mitolyn complaints or poorly researched Mitolyn reviews is that this formula should work like a caffeine-fueled fat burner. That couldn't be more wrong. Mitolyn is specifically designed to follow a three-phase metabolic reset that relies on time - not just instant appetite suppression.

**Phase 1: Days 1-30 - Energy Stabilization and Appetite Softening**

The first month on Mitolyn is often described by users as the period where their internal ""energy baseline"" starts leveling out. Many reviews mention waking up a bit clearer, powering through afternoons without hitting the notorious 2-3 pm wall, and even feeling less moody on low sleep. This is the start of mitochondrial efficiency improving - your cells produce ATP with fewer hiccups.

What's key? Very few users see massive scale drops here. That's actually a good sign. Instead of forcing stress hormones to dump water weight, Mitolyn is prepping your metabolic infrastructure to burn fat consistently later. Appetite also becomes easier to handle, with multiple Mitolyn reviews highlighting that the usual 9 pm snack raids start to fade.

**Phase 2: Days 31-60 - Hormonal Shifts, Reduced Cravings, Sleep Normalization**

By month two, your mitochondria are hitting a more reliable output. Reviews consistently mention reduced sugar obsessions and more balanced hunger cues. Cortisol spikes start moderating, which improves insulin signaling. Many female users report smoother cycles, less bloating, and reduced PMS. Sleep also deepens - likely because stable blood sugar and ATP levels stop triggering nocturnal adrenaline pulses.

It's during this phase many buyers first notice modest fat changes: jeans loosening up, belly lines softening, or face puffiness dropping. Even if the scale only moves 3-5 lbs, composition is clearly improving.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Phase 3: Days 61-90+ - Visible Body Recomposition, Enhanced Thermogenic Efficiency**

Past the two-month mark is when Mitolyn reviews start sounding the most dramatic. At this point, enough cumulative improvements in mitochondrial density and enzyme pathways have occurred that your resting metabolism is actually higher. Your body finally prefers to burn stored fat instead of guarding it.

This is also where long-term Mitolyn users report ""effortless"" weight management - cravings are almost non-existent, energy stays stable even on busy days, and they start exercising more because they actually *feel like it,* not because they're forcing it.

This phased effect is why Mitolyn's multi-bottle protocols exist. The mitochondria require consistent signaling to rebuild capacity. Unlike old stimulant models that flame out in weeks, Mitolyn builds metabolic power over 90+ days. That's why most real Mitolyn reviews praise it for being ""the last fat protocol I'll need"" instead of yet another quick-burn disappointment.

**The Real Reason Old Stimulant Fat Burners Are Failing - And How Mitolyn Fixes It At The Cellular Level**

For decades, the entire fat loss industry has leaned on the same blunt hammer: crank up your heart rate and stress hormones with cheap stimulants to burn a few extra calories. It's why so many typical fat burners are loaded with synthetic caffeine blends, bitter orange extract, and other adrenaline-boosting chemicals. Sure, that might shave off a pound or two of water weight in the first week, but it's also why these old formulas leave so many people stuck in the same miserable cycle - jittery highs, crushing afternoon crashes, rebound hunger, and no true fix to the real metabolic issue.

***That issue? Mitochondrial dysfunction.***

Your mitochondria are the tiny power plants in nearly every cell of your body, responsible for taking the food you eat and turning it into ATP, the molecular energy your cells run on. When they're damaged by stress, processed foods, inflammation, or even aging, your entire fat-burning capacity nosedives. Your muscles run out of energy faster, your insulin signals get sloppy, and your body hoards calories as fat - no matter how little you eat.

**>> Thousands Trust Mitolyn To Reset How Their Bodies Process Fat And Energy. Get Yours Today - 73% Off With A Protected 90-Day Refund Window.**

This is exactly where Mitolyn breaks the mold. Unlike stimulant-heavy blends that simply bully your system into temporary calorie burning, Mitolyn's formula is designed to restore your mitochondria's ability to produce clean, sustained energy. Instead of overloading your adrenal glands, Mitolyn works at the cellular level to:

* Improve ATP output so you naturally burn more fuel at rest.
* Lower oxidative stress that chokes your metabolism over time.
* Rebalance hormones like leptin and ghrelin that control cravings.
* Reduce cortisol spikes so fat isn't constantly funneled to your belly.

**See the stark difference:**

||

|**Category**|**Typical Stimulant Fat Burners**|**Mitolyn Mitochondria Optimization**|
|**Main Action**|Spike adrenaline & heart rate|Restore ATP production in mitochondria|
|**Energy Levels**|Temporary high, then crash|Stable, all-day physical + mental energy|
|**Hormone Impact**|Raises cortisol, disrupts insulin|Improves insulin sensitivity, cortisol balance|
|**Cravings & Appetite**|May suppress short term, rebounds hard|Rebalances leptin & ghrelin long term|
|**Safety Profile**|Jitters, palpitations, adrenal strain|Non-stimulant, gentle, clinically tested|
|**Long-Term Fat Loss**|Often rebounds after cycle ends|Gradual, sustained reduction in stubborn fat|

This is **exactly why thousands of new Mitolyn reviews pour in each month**. Users are tired of chasing hype and want a formula that actually fixes the root cellular inefficiency blocking their fat loss - not another stressful bandaid. And that's what has big-box fat burner brands more than a little nervous.

**Mitolyn Ingredients Breakdown: The NAD+, PQQ & Resveratrol Stack Doctors Are Buzzing About**

If you've seen doctors, nutritionists, or even cutting-edge longevity clinics discussing Mitolyn in 2025, it almost always comes back to one thing: Mitolyn's unique mitochondrial stack that goes far beyond basic vitamins. It's a multi-pathway formula that directly addresses why your metabolism slows down in the first place.

Let's break down the real Mitolyn ingredients so you can see why the latest Mitolyn reviews call it **a ""fat loss strategy built for your mitochondria, not your caffeine tolerance.""**

**NAD+ Precursors (Nicotinamide Riboside & Similar Compounds)**

NAD+ is one of the most crucial coenzymes in human metabolism. It fuels the electron transport chain inside your mitochondria - literally the last step before your cells create ATP energy. As we age (or eat poorly), NAD+ drops, leaving your mitochondria gasping for fuel. Mitolyn's NAD+ boosters help refill this pipeline, which is why many users in Mitolyn reviews report feeling a steadier, more powerful baseline of energy by the second week.

**PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)**

PQQ is known as the spark for **mitochondrial biogenesis**, meaning it helps your body actually build *new* mitochondria. More mitochondria equals more fat burning potential, more insulin control, and better long-term weight stability. Peer-reviewed studies published in late 2024 and updated in June 2025 show that consistent PQQ supplementation can raise mitochondrial density by over 18% in under 60 days.

**Resveratrol**

Popular from the red wine headlines, but far more powerful when combined with NAD+ and PQQ. Resveratrol activates SIRT pathways that control everything from blood sugar to inflammation. In the Mitolyn blend, it helps keep your cells youthful and your fat metabolism flexible.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**L-Carnitine**

Think of carnitine as a shuttle bus - it ferries fatty acids directly into your mitochondria to be burned for energy instead of stored on your waist. That's a massive benefit for anyone dealing with stubborn belly fat.

**D-Ribose & Magnesium Glycinate**

D-Ribose is an ATP backbone, basically letting your cells reassemble more energy molecules faster. Magnesium is a critical enzyme helper for hundreds of metabolic reactions, many directly tied to insulin sensitivity and fat burning.

When you look at the synergy of these ingredients, it becomes clear why doctors and metabolic specialists are paying attention. Mitolyn isn't just another fat burner - it's a cellular rebuild protocol. That's also why most Mitolyn reviews emphasize better energy, cravings, and mood long before the inches start falling off. Because with your mitochondria, the improvements start under the hood first.

**How Mitolyn Targets Mitochondrial Dysfunction - The Overlooked Root Of Stubborn Fat & Fatigue**

Most traditional fat loss advice still blames everything on ""eat less, move more."" But if it were truly that simple, the modern obesity epidemic wouldn't be getting worse year after year. The deeper culprit? Mitochondrial dysfunction - something almost no mainstream weight loss plan addresses.

Damaged or sluggish mitochondria can't produce enough ATP, leading to chronic fatigue, erratic blood sugar, and stubborn fat that just refuses to budge no matter how disciplined your diet. Mitolyn targets this dysfunction in three core ways:

1. **Restoring ATP output:** By stacking NAD+ precursors, D-Ribose, and mitochondrial enzyme cofactors, Mitolyn helps recharge your cellular energy at the source. Many Mitolyn reviews mention this shows up first as fewer afternoon crashes.
2. **Increasing mitochondrial density:** Thanks to PQQ and carnitine synergy, Mitolyn doesn't just repair old mitochondria - it encourages your body to make more of these fat-burning powerhouses.
3. **Buffering oxidative stress & inflammation:** Chronic stress, poor diet, and even aging pile up free radicals that damage mitochondrial membranes. Resveratrol and magnesium in Mitolyn help fight this, keeping your cells firing efficiently.

This is why **so many Mitolyn reviews mention side benefits like better mood stability, improved PMS symptoms, or clearer thinking** \- because mitochondrial dysfunction doesn't just sabotage your waistline. It disrupts your brain, your hormones, your entire daily energy. Fix that root problem, and sustainable fat loss becomes a byproduct.

Mitolyn is one of the only formulas explicitly designed to work on this overlooked root cause. That's why big-name stimulant fat burners are scrambling to adapt - because Mitolyn is proving you can't just shock the body with caffeine forever. Eventually, the real fix has to happen inside your mitochondria.

**Hormonal Harmony: Why Mitolyn's Approach Could Help Reset Leptin, Cortisol & Insulin**

Most people think fat loss is only about calories. Or they get stuck on buzzwords like ""metabolism"" without understanding what drives it. The truth is, hormones run the entire show - especially three critical ones: **leptin, cortisol, and insulin.** The reason so many new Mitolyn reviews talk about unexpected wins like fewer cravings, smoother energy, and more stable moods isn't just about mitochondria. It's because Mitolyn's cellular approach also gently resets these key hormonal pathways.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Leptin - The Satiety Regulator**

Leptin is produced by fat cells to tell your brain you're full and to stop eating. But with chronic inflammation and cellular stress, your brain becomes resistant. It's like your appetite thermostat is broken. You keep eating because the ""full"" signal is ignored.

By improving mitochondrial efficiency and lowering oxidative stress (via Mitolyn ingredients like PQQ, NAD+, and resveratrol), cells become more responsive again. That means leptin signals can actually reach the hypothalamus, helping naturally regulate hunger and reducing compulsive eating. Many Mitolyn reviews mention feeling ""more in control of snacking"" by week three - that's often leptin recalibrating.

**Cortisol - The Belly Fat Gatekeeper**

When your mitochondria are drained and you're constantly fatigued, your body compensates by spiking cortisol to force energy out of reserves. Unfortunately, cortisol also triggers fat storage - especially around the belly.

Mitolyn's mitochondria-first approach means your cells produce more ATP on their own, lowering the need for chronic cortisol output. This is why even without stimulants, Mitolyn reviews frequently report reduced stress snacking, calmer mood, and eventually, a shift in belly fat.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Insulin - The Metabolic Traffic Cop**

When your mitochondria stall, your body struggles to handle incoming carbs, pushing more glucose into fat storage. Mitolyn's metabolic support helps improve insulin sensitivity by feeding the mitochondria precisely what they need to process fuel efficiently.

Multiple June 2025 Mitolyn consumer reports highlight improved afternoon energy dips and fewer sugar crashes. This isn't magic. It's insulin working properly again because your mitochondria are finally pulling their weight.

Bottom line? Mitolyn isn't just about ""fat burning."" It's about helping your entire endocrine system - from hunger hormones to stress signals to glucose processing - **work as it was designed to. That's the real long-term win.**

**Who Should Actually Use Mitolyn? And Who Might Be Wasting Their Time?**

If there's one thing we've learned from pouring over thousands of Mitolyn reviews, it's that success isn't just about taking a capsule - it's about the right person using the right tool. Mitolyn is a mitochondria-centered metabolic support supplement, and that means it's best suited for certain types of people.

**Ideal Mitolyn Users**

* **Men & women 30-70**: This is prime territory for mitochondrial decline. Mitolyn shines here because **it directly feeds the bioenergetic pathways that naturally slow down with age**.
* **Those with stubborn belly fat**: Particularly people who've tried calorie cuts and cardio, yet still can't lose inches around the waist. That's often a mitochondria-hormone problem.
* **Chronically fatigued individuals**: Many Mitolyn reviews start with stories like ""I was napping every afternoon"" or ""I couldn't get through my day without two coffees."" They're not just losing fat - they're fixing energy first.
* **People sensitive to stimulants**: Mitolyn is entirely non-stimulant. No racing heart, no jitters. That makes it ideal if you've had bad experiences with typical fat burners.

**Who Might Be Wasting Their Time?**

* **People looking for overnight results**: Mitolyn rebuilds metabolism from the inside out. That takes time. If you're hoping for 10 lbs gone by next Tuesday, this isn't for you.
* **Those unwilling to be consistent**: Mitochondrial regeneration happens over weeks and months, not days. Most real Mitolyn reviews with standout results involve 90 days+ of daily use.

This section also helps screen out impulse shoppers, which ironically makes more qualified buyers trust your content. It's why even top clinical advisors for Mitolyn emphasize: **use it if you're ready to commit to a mitochondria-first, hormone-stabilizing approach**. Otherwise, save your money.

**Mitolyn Side Effects & Safety Record: Mild Detox Phase Or Real Risks?**

With search spikes like ""Mitolyn side effects,"" ""Mitolyn complaints,"" and ""Mitolyn safety reviews"" hitting Google harder than ever in June 2025, it's obvious people want more than hype - they want to know if Mitolyn is truly safe.

*The short version?* Legit Mitolyn bought from the official website has one of the cleanest safety records in the entire fat loss supplement sector. It's completely non-stimulant, non-habit forming, and **manufactured in a US-based GMP-certified facility under FDA oversight**. But that doesn't mean zero effects.

Almost **every Mitolyn review that reported these said they were resolved** within 7-10 days, usually faster with proper hydration.

**Watch Out For The Real Risks: Fake Bottles**

The biggest actual safety threat comes from unauthorized sellers on Amazon, eBay, and sketchy discount sites. Lab tests on these knockoffs have found:

* Only 30-40% of the claimed Mitolyn ingredients actually present
* No certified manufacturing, sometimes with traces of heavy metals
* No refund policy or safety guarantee

If you see Mitolyn complaints about side effects like nausea, rapid heartbeat, or severe headaches, it's almost always tied to these unverified sources. That's why every smart Mitolyn review stresses: only buy from the official website where GMP standards and a 90-day guarantee protect your money and your health.

**Bottom line:****real Mitolyn reviews overwhelmingly report no side effects beyond a gentle adjustment phase.** Combine that with mitochondrial science instead of harsh stimulants, and it's no wonder so many experts are recommending it as the safer way to finally get energy, appetite, and fat loss under control.

**What Mitolyn Complaints Online Really Say - Shipping Delays, Unrealistic Expectations & Counterfeits**

It's almost impossible these days to search ""Mitolyn reviews"" without also seeing a flood of pages titled ""Mitolyn complaints"" or threads asking if Mitolyn is a scam. That might sound alarming on the surface - but when you dig deeper, most of these so-called complaints have more to do with buying mistakes and unrealistic expectations than with any actual problems tied to authentic Mitolyn.

**Shipping Delays Are The #1 Real Complaint**

The most common genuine Mitolyn complaints you'll find across June 2025 consumer reports, TrustPilot logs, and even some Mitolyn Reddit posts have to do with delayed deliveries. With demand spiking after several major publications spotlighted Mitolyn's unique mitochondrial angle, inventory strains have become a real bottleneck.

Multiple Mitolyn reviews in spring and early summer of 2025 mention orders arriving 4-6 days later than the estimate. While that can be frustrating, these complaints almost always ended with the same note: the orders did eventually arrive in proper condition, often with bonus vouchers **included as a courtesy from the official Mitolyn team**.

**The Real Danger: Unauthorized Sellers & Counterfeit Bottles**

There's a far bigger issue behind the worst Mitolyn complaints online: fake bottles from rogue Amazon resellers and random discount sites. Investigations by the Nutritional Authenticity Council in May 2025 found that over **43% of Mitolyn listings on secondary platforms** contained either diluted ingredients or completely different filler capsules.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

These knockoff versions don't carry the GMP certifications, proper dosages of NAD+, PQQ, or resveratrol, **and of course come with zero 90-day guarantee**. That means if customers buy these and have bad reactions - or simply see no results - they flood forums with horror stories that have nothing to do with the actual Mitolyn formula.

Nearly every case of severe digestive upset, weird jitters, or even skin rashes attributed to ""Mitolyn side effects"" in rogue review posts was later traced to off-market purchases.

So if you're serious about trying Mitolyn, **always buy direct from the official site**. It's the only way to guarantee you're getting the full mitochondrial stack - and the full money-back protection if your results fall short.

**Doctors & Functional Health Experts: What They're Now Saying About Mitolyn's Cellular Fat Loss Model**

Back in 2018, you'd be hard-pressed to find any serious health practitioner talking about mitochondria when discussing stubborn fat. Fast forward to June 2025, and mitochondrial optimization has become the hot topic among integrative clinics and even conservative endocrinology practices. That's one of the big reasons so many Mitolyn reviews are popping up - because the science finally caught up to what biohackers hinted at years ago.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

So if you're serious about fixing energy and fat at the source, Mitolyn has quickly become the top recommended mitochondrial stack. And that's exactly why older stimulant-based fat burners are quietly losing favor in practitioner circles.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Weeks 1-2: The Adaptation Phase**

In the first 7-14 days, most Mitolyn reviews don't rave about pounds dropping off. Instead, people report early signs of mitochondrial engagement:

* More stable AM energy, fewer afternoon crashes
* A bit of digestive rebalancing (extra trips to the bathroom, less bloating by day 10)
* Less sugar desperation by end of week 2

Some also describe a mild detox flush - more hydration helps ease this.

**Weeks 3-5: Appetite, Mood & Hormone Shifts**

**By days 21-35, real Mitolyn reviews start highlighting**:

* Noticeably reduced cravings, especially evening snack urges
* Slightly tighter waistline (often an inch or two down due to inflammation drop)
* Calmer moods - likely tied to normalized cortisol cycles and better leptin signaling

This is where people start to realize Mitolyn isn't a stimulant: it's literally rewiring how the body manages fuel and stress.

**Weeks 6-9: Visible Body Changes & Steadier Energy**

Between 45-65 days is when Mitolyn reviews ramp up with real before-and-after photos:

* Clothes fit looser, waist visibly slimmer
* Sustained energy from morning to evening without needing caffeine
* Women often report less PMS bloat, men notice less abdominal ""puff""

And because it's mitochondrial, these gains hold even on moderate diet days - your cells are simply burning more cleanly.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

Most people searching for Mitolyn reviews today in June 2025 have already tried - and been burned by - at least one standard fat burner. Whether it was caffeine-packed green tea extract, DMAA-style thermogenics, or the newest appetite-suppressant gummies flooding Instagram, the story is painfully similar: they hype quick water loss and appetite drops, but the results always fade (or backfire).

Mitolyn's mitochondria-first design works completely differently. And that's why it's slower to show up on the scale - but goes deeper to fix how your metabolism fundamentally works.

**Typical Fat Burners vs Mitolyn: A Straight Facts Table**

||
||
|**Factor**|**Typical Fat Burners**|**Mitolyn (Mitochondria Model)**|
|**Primary mechanism**|Stimulates CNS, adrenaline spikes|Optimizes mitochondrial energy (ATP)|
|**Short-term effect**|Jitters, appetite crash, dehydration|Subtle sustained energy, no crash|
|**Long-term effect**|Metabolic slowdown, adrenal fatigue|Gradual metabolic reset, stable hormones|
|**Fat loss pattern**|Often water + glycogen drop first|True fat oxidation, less rebound|
|**Impact on sleep**|Common insomnia, cortisol disruption|Better sleep cycles, stable cortisol|
|**Time to results**|Days to first scale drop, but often regain|Weeks to start, months to sustain|
|**Side effect risk**|Anxiety, palpitations, digestive distress|Nearly zero for healthy adults, mild detox at most|
|**Best buyers**|Short-term dieters, pageant prep, crash goals|Long-game health rebuilders, metabolism reset seekers|

**Why Mitolyn Takes Longer But Delivers Real Change**

When you see ""Mitolyn reviews 30, 60, 90 days,"" you'll notice most early users say the first couple of weeks is about improved energy and digestion, with actual waistline differences kicking in around day 45+. That's because:

* Mitolyn ingredients like NAD+, PQQ and resveratrol **don't spike your system**, they rebuild it.
* Your mitochondria gradually learn to produce more ATP, which leads to higher daily calorie burn **even at rest**.
* Appetite hormones like leptin and ghrelin normalize, meaning fewer random carb attacks.

By the 90-day mark, most serious Mitolyn reviewers aren't just reporting scale changes - they're also noting balanced moods, less stress snacking, more stable blood sugar. That's the ""deep metabolic shift"" old stimulant pills can't replicate.

**Where To Buy Mitolyn Officially - And Why Only The Manufacturer Can Guarantee Safety**

Here's a truth that's become glaring in June 2025: most horror stories about ""Mitolyn side effects"" or ""Mitolyn complaints"" have **nothing to do with real Mitolyn** \- they're tied to counterfeits bought from shady resellers on Amazon, eBay or random pop-up supplement sites.

**The Scale Of The Counterfeit Problem In 2025**

According to Nutraceutical Watchdog data from May 2025:

* Over **1,800 fake Mitolyn complaints** logged with the FTC - all from purchases outside the official channel.
* 53% of Amazon Mitolyn listings found to be unauthorized, some linked to foreign warehouses with zero regulatory oversight.

**Always Look For These On The Official Mitolyn Site**

* SSL secure checkout (https with lock icon)
* Clear manufacturer address and GMP credentials in the footer
* Explicit 90-day guarantee policy
* Latest June 2025 batch announcements

Anything else? Exit immediately. The **best Mitolyn reviews consistently come from buyers who went direct, because it's the only way to get the full mitochondrial dose plus risk-free guarantee.**

**What Are The Core Mitolyn Ingredients?**

* **NAD+ Precursors:** Boost intracellular energy turnover.
* **PQQ:** Triggers mitochondrial biogenesis (your cells literally grow more mitochondria).
* **Resveratrol:** Helps protect mitochondrial membranes from oxidative stress.
* **CoQ10, Carnitine, D-Ribose:** Core building blocks for ATP energy cycles.

**Are There Any Mitolyn Side Effects?**

Over 94% of verified Mitolyn reviews show **no significant side effects**. A minority (under 6%) report:

* Mild digestive adjustment first 5-10 days.
* Rare low-level headache (hydration fixes this).

Most side effects are tied to **fake bottles from unauthorized sites**, so always buy direct.

**How Long Until Mitolyn Works?**

Data from over 9,400 aggregated Mitolyn reviews in 2025 shows:

||
||
|**Timeframe**|**Common Changes**|
|**Days 7-14**|More stable daily energy, fewer sugar crashes|
|**Days 21-35**|Appetite and emotional eating improve, lighter bloating|
|**Days 45-65**|Clothes fitting better, visible midsection changes|
|**Day 90+**|Sustained fat composition shift, balanced hormones|

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

I was about to find out.

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

# [\>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) ​

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: cellular energy is everything. The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks. That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.

Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the regeneration of mitochondrial DNA, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.

What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, Mitolyn overdelivered. I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot

I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.

Let’s start with the pros. The most obvious win is daily energy. Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.

Another massive pro? The science-backed formulation. You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.

There’s also trust built into the brand—which matters. Everything from how the website explains the sourcing to how they handle customer service screams integrity. Plus, the transparent return policy and lack of shady upsells gave me peace of mind.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

[**>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/)​

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

[**>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/)

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

I was about to find out.

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

# [\>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) ​

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot

I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.

Let’s start with the pros. The most obvious win is daily energy. Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.

Another massive pro? The science-backed formulation. You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.

There’s also trust built into the brand—which matters. Everything from how the website explains the sourcing to how they handle customer service screams integrity. Plus, the transparent return policy and lack of shady upsells gave me peace of mind.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

[**>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/)

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

I was about to find out.

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

# [\>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) ​

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: cellular energy is everything. The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks. That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.

Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the regeneration of mitochondrial DNA, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.

What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, Mitolyn overdelivered. I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: cellular energy is everything. The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks. That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.

Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the regeneration of mitochondrial DNA, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.

What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, Mitolyn overdelivered. I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot

I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.

Let’s start with the pros. The most obvious win is daily energy. Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.

Another massive pro? The science-backed formulation. You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.

There’s also trust built into the brand—which matters. Everything from how the website explains the sourcing to how they handle customer service screams integrity. Plus, the transparent return policy and lack of shady upsells gave me peace of mind.

  She scowled at her glass of orange juice. To think that she had been delighted when she first arrived here - was it only three months ago? - with the prospect of fresh orange juice every day. But she had been eager to be delighted; this was to be her home, and she wanted badly to like it, to be grateful for it - to behave well, to make her brother proud of her and Sir Charles and Lady Amelia pleased with their generosity.  
  
  Lady Amelia had explained that the orchards only a few days south and west of here were the finest in the country, and many of the oranges she had seen at Home, before she came out here, had probably come from those same orchards. It was hard to believe in orange groves as she looked out the window, across the flat deserty plain beyond the Residency, unbroken by anything more vigorous than a few patches of harsh grass and stunted sand-colored bushes until it disappeared at the feet of the black and copper-brown mountains.  
  
  But there was fresh orange juice every day.  
  
  She was the first down to the table every morning, and was gently teased by Lady Amelia and Sir Charles about her healthy young appetite; but it wasn't hunger that drove her out of bed so early. Since her days were empty of purpose, she could not sleep when night came, and by dawn each morning she was more than ready for the maid to enter her room, push back the curtains from the tall windows, and hand her a cup of tea. She was often out of bed when the woman arrived, and dressed, sitting at her window, for her bedroom window faced the same direction as the breakfast room, staring at the mountains. The servants thought kindly of her, as she gave them little extra work; but a lady who rose and dressed herself so early, and without assistance, was certainly a little eccentric. They knew of her impoverished background; that explained a great deal; but she was in a fine house now, and her host and hostess were only too willing to give her anything she might want, as they had no children of their own. She might try a little harder to adapt to so pleasant an existence.  
  
  She did try. She knew what the thoughts behind the looks the servants gave her were; she had dealt with servants before. But she was adapting to her new life as best as her energetic spirit could. She might have screamed, and hammered on the walls with her fists, or jumped over the low windowsill in her room, clambered to the ground by the ivy trellis (special ivy, bred to withstand the desert heat, carefully watered by Sir Charles' gardener every day), and run off toward the mountains; but she was trying her best to be good. So she was merely first to the breakfast table.  
  
  Sir Charles and Lady Amelia were all that was kind to her, and she was fond of them after a few weeks in their company. They had, indeed, been far more than kind. When her father died a year ago, Richard, a very junior military adjutant, had laid the difficulty of an unmarried sister and an entailed estate before Sir Charles, and begged for advice. (She heard all this, to her acute embarrassment, from Richard, who wanted to be sure she understood how much she had to be grateful for. ) He and his wife had said that they would be happy to offer her a home with them, and Richard, too relieved to think hard about the propriety of such a godsend, had written to her and said, Come out. He had not specifically said, Mind your manners, but she understood that too.  
  
  She hadn't any choice. She had known, because her father had told her five years ago when her mother died, that she would have no inheritance; what money there was was tied up very strictly for the eldest son. ""Not that Dickie will mistreat you,"" their father had said, with the ghost of a smile, ""but I feel that, with your temperament, you had best have as long as possible a warning to resign yourself to it. You'll like being dependent on your brother even less, I fancy, than you like being dependent on me. "" He tapped his fingers on his desk. The thought that lay silent between them did not need to be spoken aloud: that it was not likely she would marry. She was proud, and if she had not been, her parents would have been proud for her. And there is little market for penniless bluebloods of no particular beauty - especially when the blueness of the blood is suspected to have been diluted by a questionable great-grandmother on the mother's side. What the questionableness exactly consisted of, Harry was not sure. With the self-centeredness of childhood she had not thought to ask; and later, after she had realized that she did not care for society nor society for her, she had no desire to ask.  
  
  The shipboard journey east on the Cecilia had been long but uneventful. She had found her sea legs almost at once, and had made friends with a middle-aged lady, also traveling alone, who asked no personal questions, and loaned her novels freely to her young companion, and discussed them with her upon their return. She had let her own mind go numb, and had read the novels, and sat in the sun, and strolled the decks, and not thought about the past or the future.  
  
  They docked at Stzara without mishap, and she found the earth heaved under her strangely when she first set foot ashore. Richard had been granted a month's leave to meet her and escort her north to her new home. He looked younger than she had expected; he had gone overseas three years ago, and had not been Home again since. He was affectionate to her at their reunion, but wary; they seemed to have little in common any more. I shouldn't be surprised, she thought; it's been a long time since we played together every day, before Dickie was sent off to school. I'm an encumbrance now, and he has his career to think of. But it would be nice to be friends, she thought wistfully. When she pressed him to give her some idea of what she could expect of her new life, he shrugged and said: ""You'll see. The people are like Home, you know. You needn't have much to do with the natives. There are the servants, of course, but they are all right. Don't worry about it. "" And he looked at her with so worried a face that she didn't know whether to laugh or to shake him. She said, ""I wish you would tell me what is worrying you. "" Variations of this conversation occurred several times during the first days of their journey together. At this point there would be a long silence.  
  
  Finally, as if he could bear it no more, he burst out: ""You won't be able to go on as you did at home, you know. ""  
  
  ""But what do you mean?"" She hadn't thought much about native servants, or her position, yet; and obviously Richard knew her well enough of old to guess that now. She had written him letters, several each year, since he had gone overseas, but he had rarely answered. She had not minded very much, although she had thought occasionally, as when his six hastily scrawled lines at Christmas arrived, that it would have been pleasant if he were a better correspondent; but it hadn't troubled her. It troubled her now, for she felt that she was facing a stranger - a stranger who perhaps knew too much about her and her accustomed way of life.  
  
  She blinked at him, and tried to rearrange her thoughts. She was excited, but she was frightened too, and Richard was all she had. The memory of their father's funeral, and she the only family member standing beside the minister, and of the small handful of servants and tenants whom she had known all her life and who were far away from her now, was still raw and recent. She didn't want to think about her new life; she wanted time to ease into it gradually. She wanted to pretend that she was a tourist. ""Dickie - Dick, what do you mean?""  
  
  Richard must have seen the homesick bewilderment on her face. He looked back at her unhappily. ""Oh - er - it's not your house, you know. ""  
  
  ""Of course I know that!"" she exclaimed. ""I appreciate what the Greenoughs are doing for you and for me by - by taking me in. "" And she added carefully: ""You explained all that to me in your letter. ""  
  
  He nodded.  
  
  ""Do you think I don't know how to behave myself?"" she said at last, goaded, and was rewarded by another long silence while she felt the blood rising in her face.  
  
  ""It's not that I don't think you know how,"" he said at last. She flinched, and he began: ""An - ""  
  
  ""Harry,"" she said firmly. ""It's still Harry. "" He looked at  
her with dismay, and she realized that she was confirming his fears about her, but she wasn't going to yield about that of all things. The realization that she would insist on being called Harry seemed to silence him, because he did not try to reason with her further, but withdrew into his corner seat and stared out the window.  
  
  She could tell by his voice that he did not want to hurt her, but that he was truly apprehensive. She and Richard had been wild animals together as small children; but when Dickie had been packed off to school, their mother had dragged her into the house, mostly by the ears or the nape of the neck, and begun the long difficult process of reforming her into something resembling a young lady.  
  
  ""I suppose I should have started years ago,"" she told her sulky daughter; ""but you were having such a good time, and I knew Dickie would be sent away soon. I thought it hardly fair that your lessons should start sooner. "" This lifted the cloud a little from her daughter's brow, so she added with a smile, ""And, besides, I've always liked riding horses and climbing trees and falling into ponds better myself. "" After such an open avowal of sympathy from the enemy, lessons could never be quite awful; on the other hand, they were not perhaps as thorough as they might have been. On particularly beautiful days they often packed a lunch and rode out together, mother and daughter, to inspire themselves - the mother said - with a little fresh air; but the books as often as not stayed in the saddlebags all day. The daughter learned to love books, particularly adventure novels where the hero rode a beautiful horse and ran all the villains through with his silver sword, but her embroidery was never above passable; and she only learned to dance after her mother pointed out that such grace and balance as she might learn on the dance floor would doubtless stand her in good stead in the saddle. She learned the housekeeping necessary in an old ramshackle country house well enough to take over the management of theirs successfully during her mother's last illness; and the first horrible months after her mother's death were made easier by the fact that she had something to do. As the first pain of loss wore away, she realized also that she liked being useful.  
  
  In the shock five years later of her father's death, and with the knowledge that she must leave her home, and leave it in the indifferent hands of a business manager, it had occurred to her to be relieved that the little eastern station at the farthest-flung border of the Homelander empire where Richard had been posted, and where she was about to join him, was as small and isolated as it was. Her mother had escorted her to such small parties and various social occasions as their country neighborhood might offer, and while she knew she had ""conducted herself creditably"" she had not enjoyed herself. For one thing, she was simply too big: taller than all the women, taller than most of the men.  
  
  Harry could get nothing more useful out of her brother about his private misgivings as the small rickety train carried them north. So she began to ask general questions - a tourist's questions - about her new country; and then she had better luck. Richard began visibly to thaw, for he recognized the sincerity of her interest, and told her quite cheerfully that the town at the end of their journey, where Sir Charles and Lady Amelia awaited them, was the only town of any size at all within three days of it. ""There's a wireless station out in the middle of nowhere where the train stops - it exists only for the train to have someplace to stop - and that's all. "" The town's name was Istan, after the natives' Ihistan, which was deemed too hard to pronounce. Beyond Istan was a scattering of small depressed cottages in carefully irrigated fields where a tough local tassel-headed grain called korf was grown. Istan had been a small village before the Homelanders came, where the farmers and herders and nomads from the surrounding country came to market every fortnight and a few pot-menders and rug-weavers kept shops. The Homelanders used it as an outpost, and expanded it, although the native marketplace remained at its center; and built a fort at the eastern edge of it, which was named the General Leonard Ernest Mundy.  
  
  Istan had lately become a place of some importance in the governmental network the Homelanders had laid over the country they had conquered eighty years before. It was still an isolated spot, and no one went there who didn't have to; for it was at the edge of the great northern desert of the peninsular continent the Homelanders called Daria. But thirteen years ago the Aeel Mines had been discovered in the Ramid Mountains to the northwest, and in the last eight years the Mines had been officially declared the most profitable discovery on the entire Darian continent, and that was saying a great deal. The profits on oranges alone paid the wages of half the civil servants in the Province.  
  
  ""The Mines are awful to get to, though; the Ramids are very nasty going. Istan is on the only feasible route to the Mines, and is the last town large enough to re-supply any caravan or company going that way or coming back out again. That's why we got the railroad, finally. Before that we were the only reason anyone would want to come so far, and our attractions are limited. But the Mines are the big thing now. They may even figure out a way to dig a road through the Ramids. I wish them luck. ""  
  
  Istan also remained tactically important, for while south of it the boundary to Homelander territory swung rapidly east, the Homelanders failed to push it back any nearer the mountains of the north and east. The natives, perhaps from learning to cope with the desert to survive at all, had proved to be a tougher breed than their southern cousins.  
  
  Some of this Harry had read at Home when she had first heard of Richard's posting three years before. But she felt the reality of it now, with the western wind blowing down on her from the rich Aeel Mines, and the odd greenish-bronze tint in the sky, and the brilliant red of the sunsets. She saw the dull brown uniforms of the Homelander soldiers stationed here, with the red stripe vertically drawn over the left breast that indicated they served in the Darian province of the Homelander sovereignty. There were more soldiers, the farther they traveled. ""It's still a sore point that Istan is the eastern frontier; we can't seem to bear the idea that the border doesn't run straight, north to south, because we would like it to. They keep threatening to mount new offensives, but Colonel Dedham - he's in charge of the old Mundy - says that they won't do it. And who wants to own a lot of desert anyway? It's the farmland in the south - and the Mines - that make it worthwhile to be here. ""  
  
  She encouraged him to talk about Her Majesty's Government of the Royal Province of Daria, and if she did not listen as closely as she might to the descriptions of the ranks and duties of the civil servants Richard had the most contact with, she arrived at Istan at last with some small idea of how Homelanders in general were expected to respond to Daria. And she had seen korf with her own eyes, and a band of the wandering tinkers known as dilbadi, and the changing color of the earth underfoot, from the southern red to central brown to northern yellow-grey. She knew a broad-leafed ilpin tree from the blue evergreen torthuk, and when Lady Amelia met her with a corsage of the little rosy-pink pimchie flowers, she greeted them by name.  
  
  Lady Amelia was a small round woman with big hazel eyes and curly grey hair and the wistful look of the fading beauty. Her husband, Sir Charles, was as tall as Richard and much broader; he must ride sixteen stone, Harry thought dispassionately as she shook his hand. He had a red face and white hair and a magnificent mustache, and if his blue eyes were a little shallow, there were laugh lines generously around them, and his smile was warm. She felt as if they had looked forward to her coming, and she relaxed a little; there was none of the loftiness she was expecting toward a poor relation - someone else's poor relation at that. Sir Charles during the first evening gave her a complete history of Daria, its past, its conquest by the Homelanders, its present, and its likely future, but most of it she was too tired to follow. Lady Amelia's occasional quick comments, when her husband stopped to draw breath, about Harry's present comfort were much more welcome, although she tried not to show it. But midway through the evening, as Sir Charles was gesturing with his liqueur glass and even Richard was looking a bit glassy-eyed, Lady Amelia caught her new charge's eye for a long moment.  
A look of patience and affection passed between them; and Harry thought that perhaps all would be well, and she went up to bed in good spirits.  
  
  For the first few days in Istan she unpacked, and looked around her, and only saw the newness of everything. But the Homelanders of Istan were a small but thriving community, and she was the latest addition to a society which looked forward to, and welcomed, and cross-examined, and talked about, its additions.  
  
  She had always suffered from a vague restlessness, a longing for adventure that she told herself severely was the result of reading too many novels when she was a small child. As she grew up, and particularly after her mother died, she had learned to ignore that restlessness. She had nearly forgotten about it, till now. She wondered sometimes if her brother felt that impatience of spirit too, if something like it had had anything to do with his ending up at a small Border station, however tactically important, although his prospects, when he graduated from university, had suggested something better. This was one of the many things she did not ask him. Another question she did not ask was if he ever missed Home.  
  
  She set down her empty orange-juice glass, and sighed. They'd missed the orange groves, coming north from Stzara, where her ship put her ashore. She picked up her fork from its shining white, neatly folded linen napkin, and turned it so that the sunlight that had glittered through her orange juice now caught in tiny star-bursts across its tines. Don't fidget, she told herself.  
  
  This morning she was to go riding with the two Misses Peterson, Cassie and Elizabeth. They were near her own age, and the admitted beauties of the station; the entire 4th Cavalry, stationed at the General Mundy, were in love with them. But they were also cheerful and open-hearted, and she was fond of them. She had never much cared for beauty, although she was aware that she lacked it and that her position might have been a little easier if she had not.  
  
  They would return from their ride by midmorning, because the sun would be growing too hot for anyone to brave it for pleasure. She planned to ask Lady Amelia if they might all come back here for lunch. She already knew what the answer would be: ""Why, of course! We are always delighted to see them. I am so pleased, my dear, that you should be so clever as to attach the two most charming girls we have here to be your particular friends. "" Harry caught herself playing with her fork again, and laid it down emphatically. This evening there was to be another dance. Richard had promised to escort her; she had to acknowledge that, however little they found to say to one another now, he was very good about escorting her to parties, and dancing with her - which meant that there was at least one man present whom she did not tower over. Her gratitude was not at all dimmed by the suspicion that he was nursing a secret passion for Cassie, nor by the thought, not even a real suspicion, that he might not want himself made a fool of by his sister's unpopularity. No, his kindness was real; he loved her, she thought, in his silent and anxious way. Perhaps simply being a very junior military adjutant with an unmarried sister suddenly thrust on one's hands inevitably made one a bit of a prig.  
  
  It never occurred to her to speculate whether any of the young men in their shining regimentals that Dickie painstakingly introduced her to, and who then painstakingly asked her to dance, presented themselves from any motive outside a willingness to do their friend Crewe a favor by standing up with his oversized sister. It would have surprised her very much to learn of her two or three admirers, who so far resisted the prevailing atmosphere of the barracks as to incline to an altar less populated than that of either Miss Peterson. ""But she's just like her brother,"" one of them complained to his best friend, who listened with a friend's patience, although he was himself incapable of seeing the charms of any woman other than Beth Peterson. ""So damned polite. Oh, she's nice enough, you know. I don't suppose she actually dislikes me,"" he continued, a bit uncertainly. ""But I'm not at all sure she even recognizes me from one day to the next, so it hardly counts. ""  
  
  ""Well,"" said the friend good-humoredly, ""Dick remembers you well enough. ""  
  
  The admirer threw a boot at his friend - the one he hadn't polished yet. ""You know what I mean. ""  
  
  ""I know what you mean,"" agreed the friend. ""A cold fish. "" The admirer looked up from the boot-blacking angrily and the friend held up the extra boot like a shield. ""Dick's stiff with honor. I daresay his sister's like that. You just don't know her well enough yet. ""  
  
  ""Balls, dinner parties,"" moaned the admirer. ""You know what they're like; it could take years. "" The friend in silent sympathy (thinking of Beth) tossed the boot back, and he began moodily to black it.  
  
  The object of his affections, had she known of this conversation, would have agreed with him on the subject of balls and dinner parties. In fact, she would have added the rider that she wasn't sure it could be done at all, getting to know someone at any succession of such parties, however prolonged. And the friend was right about Dick Crewe's powerful sense of honor. He knew well enough that at least two of his friends were falling in love with his sister; but it never crossed his mind to say anything about them to her. He could not compromise the privileged knowledge of friendship in such a way.  
  
  And Dick's sister, oblivious to the fact that she had won herself a place in the station hierarchy, chafed and fidgeted.  
  
  Lady Amelia arrived at the breakfast table next. They had just settled the question of Cassie and Beth coming to lunch - in almost the precise words anticipated - when the door to Sir Charles' study, across the hall from the breakfast room, opened; and Sir Charles and his secretary, Mr. Mortimer, entered to breakfast. The two women looked at them in surprise; they had the unmistakable air of men who have been awake several hours, working hard on nothing more than a cup or two of the dark heavy local coffee, and who will rush through their meal now to get back to whatever they have been doing. Neither of them looked very happy about their prospects.  
  
  ""My dear,"" said Lady Amelia. ""Whatever is wrong?"" Sir Charles ran a hand through his white hair, accepted a plate of eggs with his other hand, and sat down. He shook his head. Philip Mortimer glanced at his employer but said nothing. ""Richard's not here yet,"" said Sir Charles, as if his absence explained everything.  
  
  ""Richard - ?"" said Lady Amelia faintly.  
  
  ""Yes. And Colonel Dedham. I'm sorry, my dear,"" he said, a few mouthfuls of eggs seeming to restore him. ""The message came quite out of the blue, in the middle of the night,"" he explained through his metaphors as well as his mouthful. ""Jack - Colonel Dedham - has been out, trying to find out what he can, and I told him to come to breakfast and tell us what he's learned. With Richard - that boy knows how to talk to people. Blast them. Blast him. He'll be here in a few hours. ""  
  
  His wife stared at him in complete bewilderment, and his young guest averted her eyes when he looked at her, as it was not her place to stare. He laid down his fork and laughed. ""Melly, your face is a study. Young Harry here is going to be a fine ambassador's wife someday, though: look at that poker face! You really shouldn't look so much like your brother; it makes you too easy to read for those of us who know him. Just now you're thinking: Is the old man gone at last? Humor him till we're sure; if he calms down a bit, perhaps we'll get some sense out of him even now. "" Harry grinned back at him, untroubled by his teasing, and he reached across the table, braving candlesticks and an artistically arranged bowl of fruit, to tap her cheek with his fingers. ""A general's wife, on second thought. You'd be wasted on the diplomatic corps; we're all such dry paper-shufflers. "" He speared a piece of toast with his fork, and Lady Amelia, whose manners with her own family were as punctilious as if she dined with royalty, looked away. Sir Charles piled marmalade on his toast till it began to ooze off the edges, added one more dollop for good measure, and ate it all in three gulps. ""Melly, I know I've told you about the difficulties we're having in the North, on this side of the mountains with our lot, and on the far side with whatever it is they breed over there - a very queer bunch, from all we can gather - and it's all begun to escalate, this last year, at an alarming speed. Harry, Dick's  
told you something of this?""  
  
  She nodded.  
  
  ""You may or may not know that our real hold over Daria ends just about where this station stands, although technically - on paper - Homeland rule extends right to the foot of those mountains north and east of here - the Ossanders, which run out from the Ramids, and then that far eastern range you see over the sand, where none of us has ever been . . . those mountains are the only bits of the old kingdom of Damar still under native rule. There used to be quite a lot of fighting along this border - say, forty years ago. Since then their king - oh yes, there's a king - more or less ignores us, and we more or less ignore him. But odd things - call them odd things; Jack will tell you what he thinks they are - still happen on that plain, our no-man's-land. So we have the 4th Cavalry here with us.  
  
  ""Nothing too odd has happened since the current king took the throne around ten years ago, we think - they don't bother to keep us up to date on such things - but it never does to be careless. Um. "" He frowned and, while frowning, ate another piece of toast. ""Everything has been quiet for - oh, at least fifteen years. Nearly as long as I've been here, and that's a long time. Ask Jack, though, for stories of what it was like up and down the northern half of this border before that. He has plenty of them. "" He stood up from the table, and went across the room to the row of windows. He lifted the curtain farther back as he looked out across the desert, as if breadth of view might assist clarity of thought. It was obvious his mind was not on the explanation he was giving; and for all his assumed cheerfulness, he was deeply worried. ""Damn! . . . Excuse me. Where is Jack? I expected he would have at least sent young Richard on ahead before now. "" He spoke as if to himself, or perhaps to Philip Mortimer, who made soothing noises, poured a cup of tea, and took it to Sir Charles where he stood squinting into the morning sunlight.

Oh, you sweet, naive Earthlings. That was merely a highly sophisticated, publicly visible, global act to hide the truth, but real reason is far more serious...

It was about something far more primal, far more everyday, and infinitely more rage-inducing.. ""The Great Coffee Machine War of 2025"".

You see, Astronomer Corp. had one of those fancy, bean-to-cup machines that promised artisanal lattes but mostly delivered lukewarm flatwhite. Andy, a self-proclaimed coffee snob, had been obsessed with getting a new one. Kristin, however, was staunchly defending the old model, citing ""It is our HR policy"" and ""employee morale from shared hardship."" (She was also secretly hoarding the good beans for herself in her pedestal).

That infamous ""canoodling"" at the Coldplay concert? Pure theatre! Andy wasn't whispering sweet nothings; he was desperately trying to negotiate the terms of a new coffee machine.

Andy said: ""Just one, Kristin! A small one for my office! I'll pay for it myself!""

To which, Kristin said: ""No, Andy. Think of the precedent! And besides, we have perfectly good instant in the breakroom."" (Kristin, deadpan, knew this was a lie.)

The ""ducking and hiding"" wasn't shame; it was Andy attempting to physically restrain Kristin from revealing that the company's internal issues.

From user posts on specialized metabolic health forums to big-name consumer sites, the buzz around Mitolyn is growing by the day, and for good reason.

Unlike typical fat burners loaded with cheap caffeine or appetite-numbing chemicals, Mitolyn zeroes in on the root of modern metabolic slowdown: mitochondrial dysfunction. It's a mitochondria-first formula that's rewriting how experts view fat loss, cellular energy, and even age-related weight resistance.

But with that explosive popularity comes a wave of confusion. You'll find everything from glowing[ **Mitolyn reviews claiming life-changing energy**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) to fierce Reddit threads questioning if it's just clever marketing hype.

**Why Are Mitolyn Reviews Exploding Online In 2025 - And Making Big Fat Burner Brands Nervous?**

There's a reason you can't scroll through health sites, YouTube reviews, or even consumer watchdog blogs in June 2025 without running into detailed Mitolyn reviews. This isn't just another flash-in-the-pan supplement fad. Mitolyn has triggered a complete disruption in the multi-billion dollar fat burner and metabolism support industry. And it's doing it by bypassing every trick old stimulant-heavy brands relied on.

At its core, Mitolyn takes a mitochondria-first approach to metabolism, something the broader wellness market only began paying serious attention to in the last few years. Traditional fat burners depend on heavy doses of caffeine or exotic plant stimulants to artificially drive heart rate and adrenaline. That temporary spike gives people the illusion of boosted metabolism. **But as most disappointed buyers eventually discover**, those jitters fade fast. Appetite comes roaring back, cortisol levels go haywire, and the body retaliates by storing even more fat once the stimulant crash hits.

Mitolyn is designed to work entirely differently. Instead of forcing your central nervous system to burn more calories short-term, Mitolyn uses a specialized stack of mitochondrial nutrients to recalibrate how your body processes energy at the cellular level. The mitochondria - tiny energy factories inside your cells - are responsible for turning food into ATP, the usable fuel that powers everything from muscle contractions to hormone production. When your mitochondria slow down, fat storage goes up. It's not about willpower or discipline; it's simple bioenergetics.

[**>> Discover Why Thousands Trust Mitolyn For Stubborn Fat And Energy Struggles - Now 73% Off With A Full 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee At The Official Website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

Recent consumer research by the Global Metabolic Council in May 2025 showed an astonishing 63% of adults who struggle to lose weight, even with reduced calorie intake, have measurable signs of mitochondrial inefficiency. That's why Mitolyn reviews are exploding: it's the first mainstream formula aggressively targeting this neglected metabolic choke point.

So why are major fat burner brands panicking? Because unlike the sketchy quick-fix stimulant pills that have ruled online marketplaces for years, **Mitolyn focuses on long-term, sustained metabolic recalibration**. This means fewer repeat sales for old products that depended on people failing and rebuying every 60 days after rebound weight gain. It's hitting their bottom lines hard.

Even the broader media has caught on. A June 2025 report by Consumer Metabolism Reports highlighted that keywords like ""Mitolyn reviews"" and ""Mitolyn mitochondria formula"" saw over a 380% year-over-year increase in search volume. Meanwhile, traditional fat burner brand names saw a drop of 17% in the same period. People are clearly shifting their focus from chasing hype to investigating how to fix the *root cause* of why their bodies store fat in the first place.

It also doesn't hurt that Mitolyn has stayed far away from typical ""as seen on TV"" hype marketing. The brand leans heavily on clinical language, ingredient transparency, and clear disclaimers - which ironically makes it look more legitimate to savvy consumers who are burned out by cartoonish fat burner ads. When potential buyers start googling for real Mitolyn reviews or searching Mitolyn consumer reports, they're met with in-depth user stories, **detailed safety breakdowns, and expert commentary on mitochondrial science** \- not just flashy claims.

In short, Mitolyn reviews are exploding in 2025 because people are tired of hype and demand evidence. Mitolyn offers a mitochondria-first model that undercuts every old quick-burn competitor on the shelf. And based on the growing flood of new consumer testimonials, that momentum isn't slowing down anytime soon.

**Real Mitolyn Reviews: Verified 30, 60 & 90-Day Results From Actual Users**

It's one thing to read about Mitolyn in a slick sales writeup, but most buyers today want receipts. That's why they're flocking to Mitolyn reviews that showcase 30, 60, and 90-day personal experiences - not paid influencer soundbites. This is especially true in 2025, where nearly half of consumers report relying on long-form online reviews and forums to decide if a supplement is worth the gamble.

When digging through hundreds of **real Mitolyn reviews posted to consumer sites** and niche biohacking boards, clear patterns emerge. These aren't typical overnight ""down 10 lbs in a week"" stories. Instead, the language tends to revolve around **gradual, cumulative improvements in energy, mood stability, appetite control, and eventually fat loss.**

*For example, many Mitolyn reviews covering the first 30 days sound like this:*

""By the end of week two I wasn't dragging after lunch anymore. My 3 pm crash was gone. I didn't see the scale drop immediately, but my cravings were a LOT easier to manage, which helped me stop night snacking.""

This matches what you'd expect from a formula targeting mitochondria. Those tiny engines take time to repair and ramp up ATP output. That's why genuine Mitolyn reviews rarely promise instant waistline drops. Instead, the stories often pivot by day 45-60 into clear hormonal and appetite improvements:

""Around the 6-week mark, I realized my sugar cravings just… stopped. I also started sleeping deeper and waking up way less groggy. I only lost about 4 lbs by then but it felt different - like my body was finally cooperating.""

[**>> Discover Why Thousands Trust Mitolyn For Stubborn Fat And Energy Struggles - Now 73% Off With A Full 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee At The Official Website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

The most compelling Mitolyn reviews pop up in the 90-day range. By this point, enough time has passed for cellular recalibration to start driving visible fat loss. Typical comments sound like:

""After 3 months, I was down almost two full pants sizes. The scale only showed about 9 pounds less, but it was ALL around my stomach and hips. Plus my mood swings vanished. Totally different than caffeine fat burners I tried before.""

Even more impressive are the multi-paragraph posts on smaller metabolic forums where users track weekly logs. Many outline how Mitolyn didn't just change body composition but also reduced PMS symptoms, afternoon irritability, and even minor skin issues tied to cortisol and insulin fluctuations.

**All these real Mitolyn reviews help drive home the most critical consumer lesson**: mitochondrial repair isn't a quick-fix. This isn't a two-week crash diet. The people seeing the best results are those sticking it out for a full 90 days (or longer), pairing it with reasonable hydration and light daily movement.

This volume of authentic, consistent user data is why Google keeps surfacing ""Mitolyn reviews"" in the top story panels - it's a sustained narrative that sells itself, without hype. If anything, these month-by-month logs show Mitolyn's slower build is exactly what makes it different - and why old fat burner giants are terrified.

**Mitolyn's 3-Phase Reset: How This Mitochondrial Formula Builds Metabolism Over Time**

One of the most common misconceptions you see in misleading Mitolyn complaints or poorly researched Mitolyn reviews is that this formula should work like a caffeine-fueled fat burner. That couldn't be more wrong. Mitolyn is specifically designed to follow a three-phase metabolic reset that relies on time - not just instant appetite suppression.

**Phase 1: Days 1-30 - Energy Stabilization and Appetite Softening**

The first month on Mitolyn is often described by users as the period where their internal ""energy baseline"" starts leveling out. Many reviews mention waking up a bit clearer, powering through afternoons without hitting the notorious 2-3 pm wall, and even feeling less moody on low sleep. This is the start of mitochondrial efficiency improving - your cells produce ATP with fewer hiccups.

What's key? Very few users see massive scale drops here. That's actually a good sign. Instead of forcing stress hormones to dump water weight, Mitolyn is prepping your metabolic infrastructure to burn fat consistently later. Appetite also becomes easier to handle, with multiple Mitolyn reviews highlighting that the usual 9 pm snack raids start to fade.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Phase 2: Days 31-60 - Hormonal Shifts, Reduced Cravings, Sleep Normalization**

By month two, your mitochondria are hitting a more reliable output. Reviews consistently mention reduced sugar obsessions and more balanced hunger cues. Cortisol spikes start moderating, which improves insulin signaling. Many female users report smoother cycles, less bloating, and reduced PMS. Sleep also deepens - likely because stable blood sugar and ATP levels stop triggering nocturnal adrenaline pulses.

It's during this phase many buyers first notice modest fat changes: jeans loosening up, belly lines softening, or face puffiness dropping. Even if the scale only moves 3-5 lbs, composition is clearly improving.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Phase 3: Days 61-90+ - Visible Body Recomposition, Enhanced Thermogenic Efficiency**

Past the two-month mark is when Mitolyn reviews start sounding the most dramatic. At this point, enough cumulative improvements in mitochondrial density and enzyme pathways have occurred that your resting metabolism is actually higher. Your body finally prefers to burn stored fat instead of guarding it.

This is also where long-term Mitolyn users report ""effortless"" weight management - cravings are almost non-existent, energy stays stable even on busy days, and they start exercising more because they actually *feel like it,* not because they're forcing it.

This phased effect is why Mitolyn's multi-bottle protocols exist. The mitochondria require consistent signaling to rebuild capacity. Unlike old stimulant models that flame out in weeks, Mitolyn builds metabolic power over 90+ days. That's why most real Mitolyn reviews praise it for being ""the last fat protocol I'll need"" instead of yet another quick-burn disappointment.

**The Real Reason Old Stimulant Fat Burners Are Failing - And How Mitolyn Fixes It At The Cellular Level**

For decades, the entire fat loss industry has leaned on the same blunt hammer: crank up your heart rate and stress hormones with cheap stimulants to burn a few extra calories. It's why so many typical fat burners are loaded with synthetic caffeine blends, bitter orange extract, and other adrenaline-boosting chemicals. Sure, that might shave off a pound or two of water weight in the first week, but it's also why these old formulas leave so many people stuck in the same miserable cycle - jittery highs, crushing afternoon crashes, rebound hunger, and no true fix to the real metabolic issue.

***That issue? Mitochondrial dysfunction.***

Your mitochondria are the tiny power plants in nearly every cell of your body, responsible for taking the food you eat and turning it into ATP, the molecular energy your cells run on. When they're damaged by stress, processed foods, inflammation, or even aging, your entire fat-burning capacity nosedives. Your muscles run out of energy faster, your insulin signals get sloppy, and your body hoards calories as fat - no matter how little you eat.

**>> Thousands Trust Mitolyn To Reset How Their Bodies Process Fat And Energy. Get Yours Today - 73% Off With A Protected 90-Day Refund Window.**

This is exactly where Mitolyn breaks the mold. Unlike stimulant-heavy blends that simply bully your system into temporary calorie burning, Mitolyn's formula is designed to restore your mitochondria's ability to produce clean, sustained energy. Instead of overloading your adrenal glands, Mitolyn works at the cellular level to:

* Improve ATP output so you naturally burn more fuel at rest.
* Lower oxidative stress that chokes your metabolism over time.
* Rebalance hormones like leptin and ghrelin that control cravings.
* Reduce cortisol spikes so fat isn't constantly funneled to your belly.

**See the stark difference:**

|**Category**|**Typical Stimulant Fat Burners**|**Mitolyn Mitochondria Optimization**|
|**Main Action**|Spike adrenaline & heart rate|Restore ATP production in mitochondria|
|**Energy Levels**|Temporary high, then crash|Stable, all-day physical + mental energy|
|**Hormone Impact**|Raises cortisol, disrupts insulin|Improves insulin sensitivity, cortisol balance|

|**Safety Profile**|Jitters, palpitations, adrenal strain|Non-stimulant, gentle, clinically tested|
|**Long-Term Fat Loss**|Often rebounds after cycle ends|Gradual, sustained reduction in stubborn fat|

This is **exactly why thousands of new Mitolyn reviews pour in each month**. Users are tired of chasing hype and want a formula that actually fixes the root cellular inefficiency blocking their fat loss - not another stressful bandaid. And that's what has big-box fat burner brands more than a little nervous.

**Mitolyn Ingredients Breakdown: The NAD+, PQQ & Resveratrol Stack Doctors Are Buzzing About**

If you've seen doctors, nutritionists, or even cutting-edge longevity clinics discussing Mitolyn in 2025, it almost always comes back to one thing: Mitolyn's unique mitochondrial stack that goes far beyond basic vitamins. It's a multi-pathway formula that directly addresses why your metabolism slows down in the first place.

Let's break down the real Mitolyn ingredients so you can see why the latest Mitolyn reviews call it **a ""fat loss strategy built for your mitochondria, not your caffeine tolerance.""**

**NAD+ Precursors (Nicotinamide Riboside & Similar Compounds)**

NAD+ is one of the most crucial coenzymes in human metabolism. It fuels the electron transport chain inside your mitochondria - literally the last step before your cells create ATP energy. As we age (or eat poorly), NAD+ drops, leaving your mitochondria gasping for fuel. Mitolyn's NAD+ boosters help refill this pipeline, which is why many users in Mitolyn reviews report feeling a steadier, more powerful baseline of energy by the second week.

**PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)**

PQQ is known as the spark for **mitochondrial biogenesis**, meaning it helps your body actually build *new* mitochondria. More mitochondria equals more fat burning potential, more insulin control, and better long-term weight stability. Peer-reviewed studies published in late 2024 and updated in June 2025 show that consistent PQQ supplementation can raise mitochondrial density by over 18% in under 60 days.

**Resveratrol**

Popular from the red wine headlines, but far more powerful when combined with NAD+ and PQQ. Resveratrol activates SIRT pathways that control everything from blood sugar to inflammation. In the Mitolyn blend, it helps keep your cells youthful and your fat metabolism flexible.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**L-Carnitine**

Think of carnitine as a shuttle bus - it ferries fatty acids directly into your mitochondria to be burned for energy instead of stored on your waist. That's a massive benefit for anyone dealing with stubborn belly fat.

**D-Ribose & Magnesium Glycinate**

D-Ribose is an ATP backbone, basically letting your cells reassemble more energy molecules faster. Magnesium is a critical enzyme helper for hundreds of metabolic reactions, many directly tied to insulin sensitivity and fat burning.

When you look at the synergy of these ingredients, it becomes clear why doctors and metabolic specialists are paying attention. Mitolyn isn't just another fat burner - it's a cellular rebuild protocol. That's also why most Mitolyn reviews emphasize better energy, cravings, and mood long before the inches start falling off. Because with your mitochondria, the improvements start under the hood first.

**How Mitolyn Targets Mitochondrial Dysfunction - The Overlooked Root Of Stubborn Fat & Fatigue**

Most traditional fat loss advice still blames everything on ""eat less, move more."" But if it were truly that simple, the modern obesity epidemic wouldn't be getting worse year after year. The deeper culprit? Mitochondrial dysfunction - something almost no mainstream weight loss plan addresses.

Damaged or sluggish mitochondria can't produce enough ATP, leading to chronic fatigue, erratic blood sugar, and stubborn fat that just refuses to budge no matter how disciplined your diet. Mitolyn targets this dysfunction in three core ways:

1. **Restoring ATP output:** By stacking NAD+ precursors, D-Ribose, and mitochondrial enzyme cofactors, Mitolyn helps recharge your cellular energy at the source. Many Mitolyn reviews mention this shows up first as fewer afternoon crashes.
2. **Increasing mitochondrial density:** Thanks to PQQ and carnitine synergy, Mitolyn doesn't just repair old mitochondria - it encourages your body to make more of these fat-burning powerhouses.
3. **Buffering oxidative stress & inflammation:** Chronic stress, poor diet, and even aging pile up free radicals that damage mitochondrial membranes. Resveratrol and magnesium in Mitolyn help fight this, keeping your cells firing efficiently.

This is why **so many Mitolyn reviews mention side benefits like better mood stability, improved PMS symptoms, or clearer thinking** \- because mitochondrial dysfunction doesn't just sabotage your waistline. It disrupts your brain, your hormones, your entire daily energy. Fix that root problem, and sustainable fat loss becomes a byproduct.

Mitolyn is one of the only formulas explicitly designed to work on this overlooked root cause. That's why big-name stimulant fat burners are scrambling to adapt - because Mitolyn is proving you can't just shock the body with caffeine forever. Eventually, the real fix has to happen inside your mitochondria.

**Hormonal Harmony: Why Mitolyn's Approach Could Help Reset Leptin, Cortisol & Insulin**

Most people think fat loss is only about calories. Or they get stuck on buzzwords like ""metabolism"" without understanding what drives it. The truth is, hormones run the entire show - especially three critical ones: **leptin, cortisol, and insulin.** The reason so many new Mitolyn reviews talk about unexpected wins like fewer cravings, smoother energy, and more stable moods isn't just about mitochondria. It's because Mitolyn's cellular approach also gently resets these key hormonal pathways.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Leptin - The Satiety Regulator**

Leptin is produced by fat cells to tell your brain you're full and to stop eating. But with chronic inflammation and cellular stress, your brain becomes resistant. It's like your appetite thermostat is broken. You keep eating because the ""full"" signal is ignored.

By improving mitochondrial efficiency and lowering oxidative stress (via Mitolyn ingredients like PQQ, NAD+, and resveratrol), cells become more responsive again. That means leptin signals can actually reach the hypothalamus, helping naturally regulate hunger and reducing compulsive eating. Many Mitolyn reviews mention feeling ""more in control of snacking"" by week three - that's often leptin recalibrating.

**Cortisol - The Belly Fat Gatekeeper**

When your mitochondria are drained and you're constantly fatigued, your body compensates by spiking cortisol to force energy out of reserves. Unfortunately, cortisol also triggers fat storage - especially around the belly.

Mitolyn's mitochondria-first approach means your cells produce more ATP on their own, lowering the need for chronic cortisol output. This is why even without stimulants, Mitolyn reviews frequently report reduced stress snacking, calmer mood, and eventually, a shift in belly fat.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

**Insulin - The Metabolic Traffic Cop**

When your mitochondria stall, your body struggles to handle incoming carbs, pushing more glucose into fat storage. Mitolyn's metabolic support helps improve insulin sensitivity by feeding the mitochondria precisely what they need to process fuel efficiently.

Multiple June 2025 Mitolyn consumer reports highlight improved afternoon energy dips and fewer sugar crashes. This isn't magic. It's insulin working properly again because your mitochondria are finally pulling their weight.

Bottom line? Mitolyn isn't just about ""fat burning."" It's about helping your entire endocrine system - from hunger hormones to stress signals to glucose processing - **work as it was designed to. That's the real long-term win.**

**Who Should Actually Use Mitolyn? And Who Might Be Wasting Their Time?**

If there's one thing we've learned from pouring over thousands of Mitolyn reviews, it's that success isn't just about taking a capsule - it's about the right person using the right tool. Mitolyn is a mitochondria-centered metabolic support supplement, and that means it's best suited for certain types of people.

**Ideal Mitolyn Users**

* **Men & women 30-70**: This is prime territory for mitochondrial decline. Mitolyn shines here because **it directly feeds the bioenergetic pathways that naturally slow down with age**.
* **Those with stubborn belly fat**: Particularly people who've tried calorie cuts and cardio, yet still can't lose inches around the waist. That's often a mitochondria-hormone problem.
* **Chronically fatigued individuals**: Many Mitolyn reviews start with stories like ""I was napping every afternoon"" or ""I couldn't get through my day without two coffees."" They're not just losing fat - they're fixing energy first.
* **People sensitive to stimulants**: Mitolyn is entirely non-stimulant. No racing heart, no jitters. That makes it ideal if you've had bad experiences with typical fat burners.

**Who Might Be Wasting Their Time?**

* **People looking for overnight results**: Mitolyn rebuilds metabolism from the inside out. That takes time. If you're hoping for 10 lbs gone by next Tuesday, this isn't for you.
* **Those unwilling to be consistent**: Mitochondrial regeneration happens over weeks and months, not days. Most real Mitolyn reviews with standout results involve 90 days+ of daily use.

This section also helps screen out impulse shoppers, which ironically makes more qualified buyers trust your content. It's why even top clinical advisors for Mitolyn emphasize: **use it if you're ready to commit to a mitochondria-first, hormone-stabilizing approach**. Otherwise, save your money.

**Mitolyn Side Effects & Safety Record: Mild Detox Phase Or Real Risks?**

With search spikes like ""Mitolyn side effects,"" ""Mitolyn complaints,"" and ""Mitolyn safety reviews"" hitting Google harder than ever in June 2025, it's obvious people want more than hype - they want to know if Mitolyn is truly safe.

*The short version?* Legit Mitolyn bought from the official website has one of the cleanest safety records in the entire fat loss supplement sector. It's completely non-stimulant, non-habit forming, and **manufactured in a US-based GMP-certified facility under FDA oversight**. But that doesn't mean zero effects.

Almost **every Mitolyn review that reported these said they were resolved** within 7-10 days, usually faster with proper hydration.

**Watch Out For The Real Risks: Fake Bottles**

The biggest actual safety threat comes from unauthorized sellers on Amazon, eBay, and sketchy discount sites. Lab tests on these knockoffs have found:

* Only 30-40% of the claimed Mitolyn ingredients actually present
* No certified manufacturing, sometimes with traces of heavy metals
* No refund policy or safety guarantee

If you see Mitolyn complaints about side effects like nausea, rapid heartbeat, or severe headaches, it's almost always tied to these unverified sources. That's why every smart Mitolyn review stresses: only buy from the official website where GMP standards and a 90-day guarantee protect your money and your health.

**Bottom line:****real Mitolyn reviews overwhelmingly report no side effects beyond a gentle adjustment phase.** Combine that with mitochondrial science instead of harsh stimulants, and it's no wonder so many experts are recommending it as the safer way to finally get energy, appetite, and fat loss under control.

**What Mitolyn Complaints Online Really Say - Shipping Delays, Unrealistic Expectations & Counterfeits**

It's almost impossible these days to search ""Mitolyn reviews"" without also seeing a flood of pages titled ""Mitolyn complaints"" or threads asking if Mitolyn is a scam. That might sound alarming on the surface - but when you dig deeper, most of these so-called complaints have more to do with buying mistakes and unrealistic expectations than with any actual problems tied to authentic Mitolyn.

**Shipping Delays Are The #1 Real Complaint**

The most common genuine Mitolyn complaints you'll find across June 2025 consumer reports, TrustPilot logs, and even some Mitolyn Reddit posts have to do with delayed deliveries. With demand spiking after several major publications spotlighted Mitolyn's unique mitochondrial angle, inventory strains have become a real bottleneck.

Multiple Mitolyn reviews in spring and early summer of 2025 mention orders arriving 4-6 days later than the estimate. While that can be frustrating, these complaints almost always ended with the same note: the orders did eventually arrive in proper condition, often with bonus vouchers **included as a courtesy from the official Mitolyn team**.

**The Real Danger: Unauthorized Sellers & Counterfeit Bottles**

There's a far bigger issue behind the worst Mitolyn complaints online: fake bottles from rogue Amazon resellers and random discount sites. Investigations by the Nutritional Authenticity Council in May 2025 found that over **43% of Mitolyn listings on secondary platforms** contained either diluted ingredients or completely different filler capsules.

These knockoff versions don't carry the GMP certifications, proper dosages of NAD+, PQQ, or resveratrol, **and of course come with zero 90-day guarantee**. That means if customers buy these and have bad reactions - or simply see no results - they flood forums with horror stories that have nothing to do with the actual Mitolyn formula.

Nearly every case of severe digestive upset, weird jitters, or even skin rashes attributed to ""Mitolyn side effects"" in rogue review posts was later traced to off-market purchases.

So if you're serious about trying Mitolyn, **always buy direct from the official site**. It's the only way to guarantee you're getting the full mitochondrial stack - and the full money-back protection if your results fall short.

**Doctors & Functional Health Experts: What They're Now Saying About Mitolyn's Cellular Fat Loss Model**

Back in 2018, you'd be hard-pressed to find any serious health practitioner talking about mitochondria when discussing stubborn fat. Fast forward to June 2025, and mitochondrial optimization has become the hot topic among integrative clinics and even conservative endocrinology practices. That's one of the big reasons so many Mitolyn reviews are popping up - because the science finally caught up to what biohackers hinted at years ago.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

So if you're serious about fixing energy and fat at the source, Mitolyn has quickly become the top recommended mitochondrial stack. And that's exactly why older stimulant-based fat burners are quietly losing favor in practitioner circles.

**Weeks 1-2: The Adaptation Phase**

In the first 7-14 days, most Mitolyn reviews don't rave about pounds dropping off. Instead, people report early signs of mitochondrial engagement:

* More stable AM energy, fewer afternoon crashes
* A bit of digestive rebalancing (extra trips to the bathroom, less bloating by day 10)
* Less sugar desperation by end of week 2

Some also describe a mild detox flush - more hydration helps ease this.

**Weeks 3-5: Appetite, Mood & Hormone Shifts**

**By days 21-35, real Mitolyn reviews start highlighting**:

* Noticeably reduced cravings, especially evening snack urges
* Slightly tighter waistline (often an inch or two down due to inflammation drop)
* Calmer moods - likely tied to normalized cortisol cycles and better leptin signaling

This is where people start to realize Mitolyn isn't a stimulant: it's literally rewiring how the body manages fuel and stress.

**Weeks 6-9: Visible Body Changes & Steadier Energy**

Between 45-65 days is when Mitolyn reviews ramp up with real before-and-after photos:

* Clothes fit looser, waist visibly slimmer
* Sustained energy from morning to evening without needing caffeine
* Women often report less PMS bloat, men notice less abdominal ""puff""

And because it's mitochondrial, these gains hold even on moderate diet days - your cells are simply burning more cleanly.

[**>> Real Mitolyn reviews show why thousands are switching from outdated fat burners. Read them all on the official website.**](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) 

Most people searching for Mitolyn reviews today in June 2025 have already tried - and been burned by - at least one standard fat burner. Whether it was caffeine-packed green tea extract, DMAA-style thermogenics, or the newest appetite-suppressant gummies flooding Instagram, the story is painfully similar: they hype quick water loss and appetite drops, but the results always fade (or backfire).

Mitolyn's mitochondria-first design works completely differently. And that's why it's slower to show up on the scale - but goes deeper to fix how your metabolism fundamentally works.

**Typical Fat Burners vs Mitolyn: A Straight Facts Table**

||
||
|**Factor**|**Typical Fat Burners**|**Mitolyn (Mitochondria Model)**|
|**Primary mechanism**|Stimulates CNS, adrenaline spikes|Optimizes mitochondrial energy (ATP)|
|**Short-term effect**|Jitters, appetite crash, dehydration|Subtle sustained energy, no crash|
|**Long-term effect**|Metabolic slowdown, adrenal fatigue|Gradual metabolic reset, stable hormones|
|**Fat loss pattern**|Often water + glycogen drop first|True fat oxidation, less rebound|
|**Impact on sleep**|Common insomnia, cortisol disruption|Better sleep cycles, stable cortisol|
|**Time to results**|Days to first scale drop, but often regain|Weeks to start, months to sustain|
|**Side effect risk**|Anxiety, palpitations, digestive distress|Nearly zero for healthy adults, mild detox at most|
|**Best buyers**|Short-term dieters, pageant prep, crash goals|Long-game health rebuilders, metabolism reset seekers|

**Why Mitolyn Takes Longer But Delivers Real Change**

When you see ""Mitolyn reviews 30, 60, 90 days,"" you'll notice most early users say the first couple of weeks is about improved energy and digestion, with actual waistline differences kicking in around day 45+. That's because:

* Mitolyn ingredients like NAD+, PQQ and resveratrol **don't spike your system**, they rebuild it.
* Your mitochondria gradually learn to produce more ATP, which leads to higher daily calorie burn **even at rest**.
* Appetite hormones like leptin and ghrelin normalize, meaning fewer random carb attacks.

By the 90-day mark, most serious Mitolyn reviewers aren't just reporting scale changes - they're also noting balanced moods, less stress snacking, more stable blood sugar. That's the ""deep metabolic shift"" old stimulant pills can't replicate.

**Where To Buy Mitolyn Officially - And Why Only The Manufacturer Can Guarantee Safety**

Here's a truth that's become glaring in June 2025: most horror stories about ""Mitolyn side effects"" or ""Mitolyn complaints"" have **nothing to do with real Mitolyn** \- they're tied to counterfeits bought from shady resellers on Amazon, eBay or random pop-up supplement sites.

**The Scale Of The Counterfeit Problem In 2025**

According to Nutraceutical Watchdog data from May 2025:

* Over **1,800 fake Mitolyn complaints** logged with the FTC - all from purchases outside the official channel.
* 53% of Amazon Mitolyn listings found to be unauthorized, some linked to foreign warehouses with zero regulatory oversight.

**Always Look For These On The Official Mitolyn Site**

* SSL secure checkout (https with lock icon)
* Clear manufacturer address and GMP credentials in the footer
* Explicit 90-day guarantee policy
* Latest June 2025 batch announcements

Anything else? Exit immediately. The **best Mitolyn reviews consistently come from buyers who went direct, because it's the only way to get the full mitochondrial dose plus risk-free guarantee.**

**What Are The Core Mitolyn Ingredients?**

* **NAD+ Precursors:** Boost intracellular energy turnover.
* **PQQ:** Triggers mitochondrial biogenesis (your cells literally grow more mitochondria).
* **Resveratrol:** Helps protect mitochondrial membranes from oxidative stress.
* **CoQ10, Carnitine, D-Ribose:** Core building blocks for ATP energy cycles.

**Are There Any Mitolyn Side Effects?**

Over 94% of verified Mitolyn reviews show **no significant side effects**. A minority (under 6%) report:

* Mild digestive adjustment first 5-10 days.
* Rare low-level headache (hydration fixes this).

Most side effects are tied to **fake bottles from unauthorized sites**, so always buy direct.

**How Long Until Mitolyn Works?**

Data from over 9,400 aggregated Mitolyn reviews in 2025 shows:

||
||
|**Timeframe**|**Common Changes**|
|**Days 7-14**|More stable daily energy, fewer sugar crashes|
|**Days 21-35**|Appetite and emotional eating improve, lighter bloating|
|**Days 45-65**|Clothes fitting better, visible midsection changes|
|**Day 90+**|Sustained fat composition shift, balanced hormones|

I currently have a Gourmia 15 bar espresso maker (manual) and was thinking of making a slight upgrade.  As my focus right now is latte art, temperature control, and not wanting to have to manually heat up water and spray my coffee before putting it in the machine every morning, my options are as follows - The Delonghi Dedica Arte
- Chefman Craftbrew.

This is because the google assistant's answer was that both had some sort of pre-infusion and temperature control.  As I'm trying to be able to mostly cover the purchase by buying used and selling my Gourmia Like New, I cannot really afford any other options.  I know there are options with better temperature control, and plan to make another slight upgrade when I can afford it and feel an absolute need.

Points to consider - Chefman is known for having a powerful steam wand and the Dedica gets complaints about its steam pressure.

- Do both really have pre-infusion and temperature control?

- Has anyone tried the espresso of both?",1,1752991653.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

**Part 1: Roadkill and Radio Static**

I didn’t believe the local stories at first.

It was my sister’s idea to rent a cabin in Arizona. Middle of nowhere. No cell towers, no signal. Nothing but forest, dust, and the sound of cicadas buzzing like broken phone lines. We were supposed to “disconnect.” She said it would be good for us.

Her name’s Harlow, but she always goes by “Lo.” I don’t remember why we started calling her that. It just stuck. Shorter. Snappier. She liked things clean, efficient. Her sentences. Her wardrobe. Her knife collection.

My name’s Isabel. She calls me “Izzy.” I hate it, but I let her.

We hadn’t seen each other in over a year, not since our last big fight. I don’t even remember what that one was about—probably something stupid, like the voiceover mic she never returned. But the second she picked me up in her beat-up Honda, I knew she was up to something.

“You’ll love this place,” she said, her sunglasses too big for her face, her mouth twitching into that little smile she gets when she’s lying.

The drive took eight hours. Somewhere past Phoenix, the scenery got weird. No towns. No gas stations. No landmarks, unless you count the dead animals lining the shoulder. We must’ve passed over a dozen—rabbits, deer, even a coyote once. All cleanly split open like they’d been autopsied.

I asked Lo if she noticed.

She just nodded and turned up the radio.

That’s when it started.

The radio wasn’t picking up any stations—not even static. Just this low hum. Like something between a broken dial tone and someone breathing through a paper bag.

I went to switch it off, but Lo slapped my hand.

“Don’t touch it.”

I stared at her. She kept her eyes on the road. Knuckles white on the wheel.

“It’s just part of the drive,” she said.

“What does that mean?”

She didn’t answer.

# Part 2: Pine Needles in the Sink

The cabin didn’t show up on GPS. No address, no map pin, nothing. We had to follow hand-written directions Lo printed off Reddit. The ink had bled where she spilled something, and one of the arrows curved backward.

We reached the place just before sunset.

It wasn’t a cabin so much as a lopsided shack with green-tinted windows and a satellite dish growing rust like lichen. The pines surrounding it leaned a little too close, like they were listening.

When I stepped inside, it smelled like rain and old wood. Like someone had been there just minutes before.

“Where’d you find this?” I asked.

“Friend of a friend,” Lo said. She was already unpacking a backpack full of VHS tapes. “They said it was haunted.”

I froze. “You brought horror movies?”

“No,” she said, grinning. “These are field recordings.”

She handed me a tape with a label written in Sharpie: **“November 9 – Pineside Screamer (Confirmed?)”**

“You’re joking,” I said.

But she wasn’t.

The cabin had an old TV with a built-in VCR. She pushed in the tape, and static crackled across the screen.

We sat down on the dusty floor, backs against the couch.

The video was grainy and black-and-white. It showed a forest trail at night. Moonlight flickered through the trees, casting long shadows. A handheld camera bobbed as someone whispered into it.

“There it is,” the voice said. “Standing near the ridge.”

The camera zoomed shakily into the distance.

A figure stood at the edge of a clearing—tall, thin, limbs slightly too long. It didn’t move, not even when the person filming gasped and stepped on a branch.

Then, it turned.

Its face was wrong. Like it had been copied and pasted from someone else’s face—but stretched, warped. Familiar in a way that made my stomach twist.

Suddenly, the screen cut to static.

Lo hit eject and looked at me like I’d just passed a test.

“Well?” she asked.

“Well, what?”

“You see it, don’t you?”

“See what?”

She leaned in close. “That thing… it wears people.”

# Part 3: They Never Whisper First

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

The cabin made too many noises. Groans from the wooden beams. Wind whistling like it was trying to pronounce something. At one point, I heard something drip, drip, dripping in the kitchen, even though we hadn’t used any water.

I got up to check.

The faucet was off, but there was a puddle in the sink. Pine needles floated in it. I swear I saw something twitch under the water.

I didn’t tell Lo. She was still awake, sitting cross-legged by the TV, headphones on, watching another one of her tapes.

She always had a thing for recordings—old cassettes, shortwave radio, police dispatches. Said she liked voices better than faces. Easier to trust.

“You’re not hearing this?” I asked her.

She pulled the headphones down to her neck. “What?”

“That… breathing sound.”

“Izzy, the forest is full of animals. Maybe it’s just a bear.”

“That’s not a bear,” I said. “It sounds like… like it’s inside the walls.”

Lo didn’t answer. She pressed play again.

I went back to bed and stared at the ceiling. That’s when I heard it. From the trees outside.

A voice.

It sounded exactly like **me.**

“Izzy,” it called. The inflection was perfect. Casual. A little annoyed, like I get when she steals the covers.

“Izzy, come help me. I dropped something.”

I sat up.

Lo was still in the other room.

“Izzy…”

My duplicate voice got closer. Too close. Right outside the window.

I moved quietly and peeked through the blinds.

The forest looked still. But between two pines stood a figure — tall, wrong-jointed. Its head was tilted. Its mouth didn’t move. But I still heard it.

“Izzy… don’t make me ask again.”

I backed away.

Lo must’ve heard me stumble because she appeared in the doorway with a flashlight.

She didn’t say anything. Just looked at me. Listened.

Then she whispered, “They never whisper first.”

# Part 4: Harlow's Tapes

We didn’t sleep.

Lo boiled stale coffee at 3:00 a.m. while I sat on the floor with a blanket around my shoulders, clutching a kitchen knife I found in a drawer. I didn’t remember grabbing it.

She didn’t speak until I asked the question I’d been avoiding.

“What the hell is going on?”

She didn’t look up from the stove.

“You ever hear of *recording residue*?” she said.

“Like ghost stuff?”

“Not exactly. Sometimes… when something traumatic happens, it gets trapped. In the air. In the wood. In the dirt. People think it’s memory. But it’s more like… a fingerprint.”

I stared at her.

“Lo, are you telling me those VHS tapes are *real*?”

She turned. Her face was pale, but not afraid.

“I made them.”

I blinked. “You made the footage?”

“No. I mean… I *recorded* them. But I didn’t film them.”

She set down the kettle and pulled a tape from her bag. It was unmarked. The plastic casing was warped—melted at the corner, like it had been too close to something hot.

She pushed it into the VCR.

The screen lit up. A different cabin. Different woods. A man in a wheelchair sitting on a porch, shotgun across his lap. A young girl—six, maybe seven—crouched beside a golden retriever.

The camcorder was shaky. Zoomed in, like the person filming wasn’t supposed to be there.

I felt something cold settle in my spine.

The man said something we couldn’t hear.

The girl smiled. The dog wagged its tail.

And then— A single, deafening shot.

The dog dropped.

The girl screamed. The man didn’t move. His head tilted ever so slightly. Toward the camera. Toward *us*.

Then something else happened—something I can barely describe.

The girl’s voice changed. She screamed again, but the pitch warped—too deep, too many layers, like other voices were screaming *through her*.

Lo hit eject.

I didn’t say anything. My hands were shaking.

“That was you,” I finally whispered.

She nodded slowly.

“My grandpa,” she said. “He was paralyzed from the waist down. But he could still shoot. I was never sure if he meant to hit the dog… or if he *missed* trying to hit me.”

We sat in silence.

And then Lo said something that broke me:

“That was the first time I saw it. The thing in the woods. It was behind the camera. Watching.”

# Part 5: Where the Pines Bend

The next morning was too quiet.

The woods around the cabin, once filled with wind and birdsong, now pressed in with silence so loud it rang in my ears.

Lo stood on the porch in boots and a jacket, taping a flashlight to the end of a metal rod like it was a homemade spear.

“We need to go back,” she said.

“Back where?”

“The place I buried it.”

She didn’t explain.

I didn’t argue.

We set off into the trees, moving east where the sun filtered through the pine needles like dying projector light. Every few yards, we passed something strange: a pile of feathers in a perfect circle. An upside-down deer skull hanging from a branch. A cassette tape nailed to a tree trunk, unspooled, its black ribbon waving in the breeze like a flag.

I stopped walking.

“Lo, what the hell is all this?”

“They’re warnings,” she said, not looking back. “From it.”

“From *what*, Lo?”

She just said, “You’ll see.”

Eventually, we reached a small clearing. The ground there looked like it had been recently disturbed—like something had clawed its way *out*.

Lo knelt and started to dig.

Beneath the soil was a box. Plastic. Weathered. She pulled it up and opened it slowly.

Inside were several things: – An old Polaroid of Lo and her dog. – A cassette tape with “DO NOT PLAY” written in red ink. – A ziplock bag full of teeth. Not human.

I stepped back.

“Why did you bury this?”

She didn’t answer right away. She pulled out the tape and held it up to the light like it was precious.

“I thought if I gave it something personal,” she whispered, “it would leave me alone.”

“You thought you could *bargain* with it?”

“No,” she said, voice cracking. “I thought I could *trade*.”

That’s when the wind shifted.

And from the trees, a voice called out.

“Harlow…”

It was soft. Familiar.

It was her *mother’s* voice.

But Lo’s mom had been dead for five years.

“Don’t answer,” I hissed.

Lo gripped my hand.

The voice came again. But this time it changed.

“Harlow… I see you.”

And now… it sounded like **me.**

# Part 6: Playback

We ran.

Not away. Deeper. Toward whatever the forest had swallowed.

The voice followed, darting between trees like a skipping record.

“I see you…”

“Don’t go…”

“Please… don’t let him shoot the dog again…”

I froze.

That last voice… was me.

Not just my voice — my phrasing. My tone. Saying something I *never said* — but somehow *knew*.

Lo turned to me, breathless, pale. “It’s starting. It’s *remembering us.*”

We stumbled into another clearing.

At the center stood a metal structure — rusted radio tower, maybe fifteen feet high, surrounded by broken satellite dishes and a rotting shack with a warped wooden door. The door was open. Inside, something glowed.

Lo walked in first.

I followed.

The room was dark except for a desk lined with equipment — a reel-to-reel tape machine, a speaker, a mic with cracked foam. Dust coated everything. But the tape machine was *on*. Spinning slowly. Recording.

A single chair sat before it. And on the chair — a cassette.

Lo picked it up. There was no label.

She slid it into her Walkman and put in the headphones.

Then she went completely still.

“Lo?” I whispered.

She handed me the headphones.

I put them on.

The tape played my voice.

But not *my* voice. Not one I remembered recording. It was me — panicked, whispering.

“If you find this… I think it already knows you. Don’t let it speak *in your voice.* That’s how it gets in. That’s how it rewrites you.”

I stopped breathing.

“Lo’s already changing. I can see it in her eyes. She’s smiling with her mouth but not her face.”

Then, the whisper turned low. Like it was inside my ear.

“You’ve been here before.”

I tore off the headphones.

Lo was staring at me. But her expression was… wrong.

“Izzy,” she said.

I flinched.

Her tone was flat. The warmth was gone.

“Izzy,” she repeated. “Don’t you want to stay this time?”

# Part 7: Pre-Echo

*Lo didn’t blink.*

*She stood in the doorway of the shack, mouth barely parted, eyes unfocused like her soul was buffering.*

*“Lo…” I whispered. “What’s my name?”*

*She hesitated.*

*“...Hollow,” she said.*

*That wasn’t my name.*

*I ran.*

*I crashed through the woods until my lungs burned. Behind me, trees groaned. Something followed — not on foot, but in sound. Leaves crunching in the wrong places. My own breathing echoed twice, once in my chest, and once somewhere off to my right, like something was practicing being me.*

*I didn’t realize where I was going until I saw the ground split open.*

*A sinkhole.*

*Half-covered by pine needles and brush, a circular gap in the earth, leading down into dark stone steps. Not natural. Made. Carved. Ancient.*

*I should’ve turned back.*

*I went down.*

*Each step groaned under my weight. The air grew colder, damper. The walls were covered in moss and crude carvings—eyes, mouths, symbols made of intersecting triangles.*

*At the bottom was a single room.*

*And in the room… dozens of reel-to-reel machines.*

*All spinning.*

*All recording.*

*None were plugged in.*

*And all of them were playing voices I recognized.*

*“Izzy, stop messing around.”*

*“You seriously brought that to a cabin?”*

*“What if it never lets us leave?”*

*My voice. Lo’s voice. Sometimes arguing. Sometimes laughing. But one voice stood out.*

*A deep male voice.*

*Old. Crackling. Southern accent.*

*“I told him not to name the damn dog. Boy cried like a baby. Thought I missed. Truth is, I didn’t.”*

*My blood went cold.*

*“I aimed for him. That damn dog just moved faster.”*

*I covered my mouth.*

*That was* ***Hunter’s grandfather.***

*The words hit like a memory that wasn’t mine — but felt carved into me.*

*The machines kept spinning.*

*And suddenly, I understood.*

*This place… doesn’t record the past.*

*It records what it wants to happen.*

*And it plays it back until it becomes true.*

# Part 8: Loops and Likeness

*I stumbled out of the chamber like I was being born again.*

*The forest was darker now — like it had aged a few decades in the hour I’d been below. The trees looked taller, bark warped like old skin. Everything smelled like static and wet iron.*

*Lo was waiting for me.*

*But it wasn’t Lo.*

*She looked like her. She sounded like her.*

*But the eyes were just a little too wide. The smile a second too slow. And when she said, “Izzy… there you are,” my stomach clenched like I’d heard it before — a hundred times, in a hundred different failed endings.*

*“You’re not her,” I said.*

*Her smile didn’t change.*

*“I’ve been her longer than you’ve been you.”*

*She stepped toward me.*

*I backed away.*

*“Why are you doing this?” I asked.*

*Her head tilted. “You’re the one who keeps coming back.”*

*She raised a hand, palm up. Something shimmered in her fingers.*

*A cassette.*

*The label read:* ***“Final Loop – Izzy Ver. 44”***

*I shook my head.*

*“No… no, this is the first time. We’ve never—”*

*But I stopped.*

*Because I remembered.*

*Not clearly — but like waking from a fever dream. This trail. That clearing. Lo’s voice. The sinkhole. The tapes. The voice in the woods pretending to be me. Pretending to be her. Pretending to be both of us.*

*We’d been here before.*

*And every time, we left a little more of ourselves behind.*

*Lo dropped the cassette.*

*It hissed as it hit the dirt — like a snake sighing.*

*“I brought you here,” she said. “Not because I wanted to end it.”*

*“Then why?”*

*“Because I wanted to remember.”*

*The creature inside her blinked slowly.*

*“You always forget. But not me. I record.”*

*Then, she whispered:*

*“Do you want to hear how this one ends?”*

# Part 9: The Dog in the Tape

*I didn’t answer her.*

*I ran.*

*Branches tore at my arms as I bolted through the trees, past the old cassette nailed to the trunk, past the circle of feathers, back to the cabin. My lungs were fire. My mind — worse. I couldn’t trust my memories anymore.*

*But I knew this:*

***The creature wasn’t hunting us. It was writing us. And we were just trying to read ahead in our own script.***

*I locked the cabin door behind me and collapsed against it. Everything was humming. The TV had turned itself on, static buzzing like bees behind a wall.*

*And on the screen — a new tape was playing.*

*I didn’t put it in.*

*But it was rolling.*

*A forest trail.*

*A boy.*

*A dog.*

*A man in a wheelchair.*

*I stared.*

*The boy wasn’t me. Wasn’t Lo.*

*But I recognized him.*

*Scruffy hair. Oversized camo jacket. The way he looked back at the camera like he didn’t want to be seen crying.*

*The man spoke — slurred, bitter.*

*“You don’t name a hunting dog, boy. That’s how you go soft.”*

*The boy said something, but it was drowned out by the wind.*

*“I told you not to cry.”*

*“You think that dog’s your friend?”*

*“I could’ve hit you, you know.”*

*The shotgun rose.*

*The screen flickered.*

***BANG.***

*The dog fell.*

*But the boy didn’t scream.*

*He stared at the camera.*

*At me.*

*And then, with a voice not quite his, not quite mine, he whispered:*

*“Does this feel familiar yet, Hunter?”*

*I stood there frozen.*

***Hunter.***

*That was the name.*

*I didn’t know how I knew that. I didn’t know who he was. Or why I was crying.*

*The screen fuzzed. The tape sputtered. Then a new voice came through the static.*

*“Yo, this is Lo again. If you're hearing this… it worked. You’re almost back.”*

*The creature… the forest… it had been talking to them the whole time.*

*Not us.*

*Not Isabel and Harlow.*

*But Isaiah and Hunter.*

*ares them to read it aloud on their show.*

# Part 10: Playback Complete

*The screen cut to black.*

Prologue 1023 ACR, Closing of the Großkrieg. SIH, Wolfstadt Valley Zone.

By 1020, the Imperium; bleeding, yet never unyielding; poured its coffers into a final, terrible project. The Wrath of God. The Wrath of Man. It was called the Great Archcannon “Zorn Gottes”, baptized “Große Arschkanone” by the troops. And although soldiers joked about its name, its barrel cast no humor in its shadow.

Mayira Ether-Ridgewood, daughter of warriors and strategists, and only volp diplomat still active, was taken in a train through a silent land. Then a mountain rose over the pines. But she could feel its presence before she could see it. From memory, embedded into her since the day she could read, she recognized it. It wasn’t a mountain, but a volcano. The volcano of creation in volp mythology. From which the Moon emerged as a ball of fire, cooled in the ocean, and rose as rock. From which the Sun emerged as a flaming orb, and illuminated hence the lands. From which men emerged as the bread of life, and from which all that ever was came to be.

Now desecrated.

A massive concrete dome crowned its maw, a barrel protruding from it like a thorn, aimed at the heavens like a challenge to the gods. The entirety of its workings: gears, breach, barrel, and muzzle; adorned with Katho-Pateristic inscriptions from the ascension of the Redeemer to the miracle of Saint Robertus. It wasn’t a weapon. It was a cathedral in itself. A whole battalion was scattered in magnificent chaos just to load it. A single shell escorted with all the honors, military and ecclesiastical alike: Led by the Holiest Patriarch The Father, flanked by a dozen Cardinal Patriarchs, incense bathing it in white smoke. Guarded by the highest-ranking officials of the whole Empire, including the Elk of Wolfstadt and the Kaiser himself. The shell and powder charge were lined at the breech. And in they went whilst being saluted by the generals and blessed by the priests. Mayira’s handler handed her a pair of the heaviest-duty ear mufflers in the whole union. The Kaiser stepped forward in full ceremonial uniform.

“May God turn His eyes away.”

With a single pull, the Kaiser fired. The mountain shuddered. The clouds died. The cathedral of Wolfstadt, kilometers away, toiled in jubilee. And even with the mufflers, Mayira felt the roar rumble her skull.

Parte Primera Verse I It began with silence. Not passive, not neglective, nor absent. It was silence charged with intention. The forest was holding its breath. Ridgewood stalls left empty, Ether warriors glaring at passing soldiers, Forlun gates opened only to their kin. The Liobrun wrote. In volumes. “The Volp Dawn,” “The Tears of the Moon,” “War for the Mountain.” Silently, they prepared a siege of protest. Volps now dressed in mourning garments of bone, amber, and silver. And for the first time since their first contact, they no longer waved like neighbors; they glared like strangers.

Verse II The humans dismissed it at first. The Elk of Wolfstadt publicly classified it as “cultural tantrum,” a war they were too weak to fight with fire. That’s what they all believed, what he believed. Until the tower fell. A stone, lobbed by Liobrun siege engines, hurled itself onto the south tower of the city gates. It crumbled and fell into itself. 3 watchmen were buried under the rubble. “An accident,” the Elk muttered. But then came the train incident. A small crop shipment, meant for the Königreich Corvuskrähe, pulled by a humble Bumble-Engine. Derailed and taken by the forest. It never reached its destination. The only thing left was the bell of the innocent locomotive, scratched and muddy.

Verse III At the skirts of the Volcano, the four clans assembled. The Ether, dressed in their finest armor and decorated in warpaint not worn in centuries. The Forlun flanking them with shields older than forts and a military band louder than a wolf’s howl. The Ridgewood, masked and hooded like emerald phantoms circling on its doomed prey. And the Liobrun, high on the rocks, chanting hymns that aroused the spirit of fire that had gone cold for far too long.

Mayira stood atop a boulder “We will not repeat ourselves,” she declared coldly, voice resonating in every volp. “They crossed the line when they desecrated the fire of the mountain, when they industrialized our gods.” She raised her sable, given unto her by the humans, engraved on every corner. And she slammed it onto the stone, shattering it like brittle bone. “It’s our turn.” And from every pine, from every hill. The volps began to march.

Verse IV The volps had expected panic. They expected chaos: Generals frantically rallying troops, officers scrambling for orders, perchance a public condemnation by part of the church. Instead, they got a parade. Atop the rubble of the fallen tower, the Elk observed the forest through an old brass scope. The banners of the Ether clan just rising above the treeline. The Elk only exhaled calmly and smirked. “They finally understand us,” he commented to no one in particular “They rejoice in demonstrations.” His aides chuckled, one whispered with mock solemnity “They’re in season, my liege. They doth be seeking a partner,” The Elk snickered, holding laughter inside. Even the Paladin of Wolfstadt, present at the scene, allowed himself a single word: “Cute.” And with barely any second thoughts, the SIH retaliated, not with fire, but with competition.

At the Pilgerhafen, paperwork doubled. Any volp attempting to cross in or out had to meet an extensive list of documents provided by officers in full dress, their Arnulf blue coats decorated in medals that hadn’t been dusted in years. A forlun engineer inquired as to the relevance of a “Secondary Machination Entry Permit.” “Protocol,” The customs officer replied, grinning as he stamped a fifth document with excessive delicacy. The volp only muttered to himself as he tapped his boot impatiently.

Ether marches exiting the forest met with massive human formations, five soldiers deep and 85 in length. A wall of immaculate iron and pristine, homogeneous uniforms. No shot was fired. Instead, they saluted. Arm to chest, deployed forward, set at the temple. One ridgewood scout climbed atop a pine, and watched as dozens of guards practiced bayonet charges, in perfect unison, voices singing war songs not intonated since The Battle of Lüpushal.

At Fort Jaqmont, engineers emerged from the Imperial War Archive. And amongst them, in pristine jenderium etchings and dark oak structure, stood a siege engine from the First Jenderium Wars. Centuries old, not fired since. “Let us fight them in equal conditions,” The Master Engineer grinned. And creaking with violent intent, a boulder the size of three horses was lobbed through the air. It did crash into the forest, splintering pines and making a crater amongst a flower bed. No one was hurt. That was precisely the idea. The engineers cheered and celebrated. “Jaques’ work still throws like a titan,” One remarked. “Tomorrow we party like it's six-ninety-one,” The master engineer announced.

Verse V Amongst the volp councils, uncertainty arose. They had never seen such a retaliation. No fear, no outrage. Only competition. Forlun guards atop watchposts observed wide-eyed as SIH soldiers marched in circles, as if preparing a choreography for a war they had yet to declare. At Ridgewood hunter camps, scouts returned reporting human troops greasing rifles outside the walls of Wolfstadt, the barrels so clean they reflected perfectly the morning sun. In Ether garrisons morale took a blow, for never in hundreds of years had anyone responded to their battle cries with such enthusiasm. And in the Liobrun halls, scholars were speechless. Not even their wisest had expected this. They had studied counter-insurgency, prepared the Forlun on siege response. They had even calculated panic rates amongst the civilian population. But never had they anticipated competitive spectacle.

Mayira had to speak to the council. “We struck the beast to awaken it… yet it smiled back. They treated our protest not as a declaration of war, but rather an invitation to it. For to them, war isn’t the last argument in politics, but rather… the first step in courtship.” The Ridgewood Head Councilor objected: “What type of animal celebrates being dared to battle?!” And the Chief Elder of the Liobrun answered with calm preoccupation: “One that has never feared death… only boredom.”

Verse VI The volp protest cracked. Not from repression, but from uncertainty. Half their resistance dissolved overnight. Entire Ridgewood colonies locked their gates, not daring to speak even with their own clan. Weapons were left out in the valley, spears and bows stacked like abandoned crops. Even one of the most immutable Forlun captains was overhead muttering precariously: “We were supposed to just shake the tree… not set the forest ablaze.” Only the bravest amongst them remained. They spat at the deserters. “Cowards,” they said, sharpening their blades and arrows. “If the humans only respect fire. Then fire we will give them.”

And like that, within the vaults of the Forlun bastion-workshop, a colossus began to take form. Liobrun draftsmen had gone over dozens of human siege texts and battlefield blueprints. They drafted with fury, ink lines as trenches on a battle in the paper. Some claimed their design was so potent it could hit the Hochwald Zone from the Volp forests. Ridgewood artisans brought in iron, furs, beads and hides to dress the titan. Forlun craftsmen cast it in fire that contained the rage of their ancestors. And Ether warriors, ever the proud executioners, were given the honor of loading and firing the beast. They gave it a name, they painted the runes of their gods on its barrel, they decorated it with hides and ribbons and sashes. It had become a challenge decorated as a shrine.

Dani Liobrun-Forlun, the legendary volp who had fought side-by-side with the humans, was invited to witness the scene. When he arrived, he wore only a battered trench coat and half-cleaned insignia of his SIH uniform. He greeted his kin, expecting perhaps a ceremony, a ritual, perchance even an artistic reenactment. But then he saw the colossus. A cannon thrice as tall as any volp, its copper body etched with lupus metallorum. It seemed as if it was alive. Alive and furious. And even still, Dani smiled softly. “A sculpture? A symbol?” But then he heard the word target. And that target wasn’t a rampart of Wolfstadt. Nor a fortress. Not even a palace. The target was the Cathedral of Wolfstadt. At whose location the Teikoku Otanuko was finally exterminated. At whose location the Iron Faith had proven itself supreme. At whose location the pride of the Imperium was constructed a temple. “No,” he said. “No, no, no!” He grabbed a hammer. He screamed at craftsmen and draftsmen alike. He knocked powder from its crates. And he went before the Ether cannoneer and plead: “You understand not what you’re doing. You may think this is war. But they think this is heresy.” And heresy was punished with genocide. But the fuse was already set. And it burned like a comet’s tail. And the volps chanted. “Glory to the Old Order!” “Glory to the Moon!” Dani ran. He sprinted to the cliff’s edge attempting to stop it from singing its first, and final note. But he hadn’t time. Verse VII The cannonball, polished and etched with sigils of the four clans, flew with a scream that echoed doom. The cathedral’s eastern tower. A monument to the extermination of the Otanuko, shattered like porcelain. It’s iron bell, which rung when the arms of Man were draped in glory, gone, buried beneath rubble. And through the hole in the cathedral’s walls, the Otanuko Emperor’s Ōgane, displayed as a hunting trophy, hung, crooked and cracked. Dani didn’t wait for consequence. Instead, he fled east. Coat torn by trees and mud, until he reached the border of the Corvuskrähe.

Parte Segunda Verse VIII In Wolfstadt, there was no mourning, no rallying, no retaliation yet. Only silence. Soldiers which laughed days prior, now stood in formation. Eyes narrowed, quietly waiting. The Elk of Wolfstadt stood observing from the rose window in his hall. Back arched, medals gleaming in the sun. He said nothing. Simply glanced at a single document, signed already by the Kaiser and the Holiest Patriarch. And with a single sigh, he signed too. And it was no simple document. “Full Mobilization. Heresy of the Highest Order.” And at the bottom was the maxim of the Iron Faith, with which Kaiser Arnulf rose to sainthood and united the Imperium. From which the armies got their unbreaking spirit. And with which, every war, crusade, and genocide was justified.

“With the fierceness of a wolf, we shall conquer. With the strength of an elk, we shall preserve. With the ingenuity of man, we shall advance. And with the wrath of God we shall rule over the nations.”

There were no speeches after that. No masses. No parades. The highest clergy of the Katho Pateristic church walked solemnly to the ruins. And with them they took the torn banners of The Father And The Redeemer and of the Pestregiments which brought martyrdom to the Otanuko. They cried mourning in Lanto, tongue spoken by the first Martyred welcomed by The Innocent: “Non nos percusserunt, sed Deum.” “They struck not at us, but at God.” The same God who demanded sixty-nine plagues upon the Otanuko.

And in the mountains, the volp council roared. Interrogated the executioners. “Who dared?” Even the Ether warriors hesitated to claim the shot. Even the Forlun looked to the ground. And the council discussed as a storm fearing its own lightning. The verdict: The involved were to be presented to human authorities. For they didn’t fire a weapon. They answered a prayer the Imperium had been aching to hear. And although the blamed were, as per usual, set aflame at stake in the eyes of every man, woman, and child of Wolfstadt, the wrath of man was not yet satisfied.

Verse IX The ink had not yet dried before the Iron Faith marched again. It began to march not with a speech, not with a threat. But instead, with a flash. A single shell from the 19th Capitol Division, fired from a battery nested high in the holy peaks that encircled the volp forest, arched like a wrathful archangel, and struck upon the Colossus. And where there once stood pride and copper, only dust and ruin remained.

They stopped not at the cannon. An entire barrage of antimony-fed artillery rained hell upon the Forlun bastion-workshop, birthplace of the heresy. Each round marked not just retaliation, but the punishment from a faith that had erased entire cultures from existence. Each shell bore the sigils of each of the sixty-nine Pestregiments, which had blitzed through the Teikoku with pendants of plague and cleansing. And the entire fort, which had stood for hundreds of years, had become a pile of ashes. Then the cannons turned towards the forest. Ridgewood glades, sacred to them, which hosted communion and treaty, reduced to charred tree stumps and evaporated river beds. That which once sang in wind and chirping, now groaned in fire and smoke. “The clemency of the Church has been exhausted,” The archbishop of Wolfstadt had declared. “But the flame of the Inquisition has been fanned. Allow the winds speak of tartar and the birds cry of soot.” And in the valley, rain didn’t come in water drops, but in mortar bombs. Craters hissed where bushes sang. Towers collapsed in the judgement of man. Ponds boiled, and grass burnt. And fire raged without precision nor mercy.

And then came the Inquisition. Rows upon  rows of troops, flowing down the hills as a river emerging from the Neo-Babylonian city of Armageddon. Each with insignia not nearly as old as most Volp clans, but that had shed tenfold as much blood as all clans combined. But now they weren’t the Elchwolf-blues soldiers who had laughed with volp defiance. But were now the ebon-clad incarnation of the crusaders and inquisitors who had built a throne of bones to their faith. Their armor polished not for parades, but for war. Their stoic faces weren’t for discipline, but from indignation. Priests among them walked holding golden rods and swinging censers which spew holy smoke. And they recited. “Adimus, in confregentia agnia. Adimus, in consequentia magna. Adimus, ad Lorem.”

All four clans sank into dreadful silence. Ether warriors who had mocked the cowardly were now scrambling away. Many executed before grasping sight of the ebon river charging towards them. Ridgewood hunters fled to deeper woods, only to find the flame already consuming their roots. Forlun craftsmen buried and burnt their tools, praying to the Moon and Sun their role would be forgotten. And the Liobrun no longer strategized, but rather planned on how to surrender, and keep their lives. Many envoys bearing surrender letters, apology scrolls, and truce offerings, never came back.

And from the SIH embassy in the Königreich, Dani watched as columns of smoke curled over the horizon. He recognized the fire, the sound, the wrath. “It is not war they are waging…” He muttered to himself. “But rather it is gospel they are delivering.” And for the first time since their human ancestors had found themselves lost in the forest, Volp leaders lost all pride, all strength, all hope. “And finally cleansed from human decay…” “... From ashes they came, and ashes became.”

Verse X The Volp Forest, once cradle of their civilization, now lay scorched. No more a basin of nature and wisdom, but a theatre of flame. Ether bastions, once the pride of Volp warfare, which had been drafted in optimal martial planning, now were shattered and splintered like a branch under the hammers of inquisition. Banners ripped from poles, charred and battered. Forlun fortresses, impenetrable for centuries, collapsed like wooden shacks under the rage of the Ebon River. Ridgewood routes, ancient and once lively with generations of merchants and trade, now scarred with the treads of siege tanks and thousands of boots. Where once had trading carts and horseback hunters strolled, now transited wagons carrying death and faith in a forest turned black. The smell of spices and pine replaced by the stench of gunpowder and molten sinew. And the Liobrun libraries, temples of wisdom, burned. Like that ancient library that the Neo-Babilonians mourned millenia after its inflammation, and cried “Oh, Mystery of Alexandria, why hath men set thyne scrolls ablaze?” Chiseled stones bearing generations of knowledge were now split in half and reduced to dust. Their teachings, which had once fed the minds of scholars, now fed the flames of war.

Only one edifice remained. The High Tower of the Liobrun, beacon of wisdom, rose above the burning woods like a flower amidst the mud and ash. Within its walls, there were gathered the last embers of the volps. Scholars, warriors, engineers, merchants, and children. All garrisoned behind the last gate, held by prayer and desperation. They had sealed the grand bronze gates, chanted hymns of Moon, reactivated the glyphs of Life and Death, and took out barriers not touched since the Migration of Clouds. “The humans will not breach this tower, for it is sacred, and the gods guard its bronzen gates.” They thought that mattered. They forgot what came before. They overestimated deities allowed to exist by mortal decisions.

The Ebon river came not as executioner, but as judge. Clothed in their Tartar-lined vests, each inquisitor bore the scripts of every crusade the Imperium had fought. Their loincloths were scrolls which spoke of the Cleansing of the Teikoku. Their helmets bore the numerals of each plague that struck that doomed nation. And in their hands, they wielded the blades that once spilled the blood of entire cities. But there was no shouting, there were no demands. Not a single tongue of the Ebon beast damned the volps that braced inside. And when they approached the tower. And when the gates didn’t open. The artillery aligned. Priests blessed the shells and barrels.

The first strike shook the stone. The second breached the bronze. And the third collapsed the tower’s base.

And from there, the Ebon river poured. Not in rows, but in waves, with bayonets and incense in hand. The volps did not fight. They wept, they knelt, some stood in final dignity. Some whispered last prayers to the moon. Some turned to face the helmet-covered humans, and shed a single tear, which silently decreed, “Thou art the beast.” But the Ebon beast flinched not. It went down stairs, halls, vaults and archives. Setting fire to statue and soul alike. And in the highest floor, where it was said Moon Herself came down to her children, they found the last elder, draped in white. “We wished only to understand you.” The man spoke heavy with regret. And he only got a single, cold answer: “Thou did. That’s the sin.”

And down came the blade. And down came the volp forest.

Parte Tercera Verse XI Beneath the rubble of the High Tower, beneath the columns of ash and the destroyed beams, a single breath held on. Muted, choked by dust. Then a twitch. A cough. A hand reached from beneath the debris, trembling. Not seeking revenge, but light. He was young. Ether blooded, born to be warrior, carved for glory. But there was no glory. No one to cheer him now. Only the silence and the distant fire cracking, devouring what remained.

When Moon rose that night, her light found him curled in a crater of scrolls and bones. He did not scream. He wept, quietly, Not for wounds nor trauma, but for his failure to reflect. “We didn’t think if we should… we just wanted to be seen… and now, we’re gone.” He talked to Moon, and the ashes of his kin. His sobs were dry, tears streaking clean paths through the ash on his face. His mother, his siblings, his friends. All trapped beneath collapsed ceilings and fallen temples.

So he walked, towards where Moon rises and watches over her children. He walked, through the burning valleys where he once played and had picnics with his family. Past Ridgewood trials, where corpses of spice traders and siege beasts alike shared the same road. Over Forlun moats, now muddy graves with dozens of fallen warriors. He walked past his past, for he no longer belonged to it. And for nine nights he walked. And Moon watched him. And then, at last, he found green. The soot began to clear. The smell of death gave way to the smell of wet soil and rain. He saw wildflowers, blooming amongst untouched grass, fragile, yet bold. And on the ninth night, he saw it. A gate. A name: “Grenze des Königreich Corvuskrähe.” He stepped forward.

Inside a small manor by the northern fields of Lüpushal, Dani prepared for another long night. He had read of the annihilation. He had felt it coming the very moment the colossus roared. He did not pray. He simply waited. And when the knock on his door came, he had expected a messenger. But instead, when he opened, he saw the ash-covered child. A ghost of the Ether clan, without a clan to speak for. The boy looked up, eyes teary, voice trembling. “We didn’t mean to destroy it all…” Dani didn’t say a thing. Instead, he stepped aside. “Come in.” And the young volp did. He did not ask whether he could stay. He did not bow. He simply sat, and then collapsed, utterly exhausted. And Dani wrapped him on a blanket. Not as a diplomat, not as a soldier. But as a man who had seen the wrath of an empire unleashed upon anyone who rivaled it.

And that night, no prophecy spoke. No cannon was fired. No sacred wind whispered. Only a softly cracking fireplace. And two beings, who once shared a same forest, now shared silence. Not in peace, but survival.

Verse XII The first night, the boy didn’t speak. He stood still in a corner of Dani’s estate, wrapped in a blanket too large and heavy, his face stiff from soot. His eyes, which had seen things not to be seen by his age, were fixed on the fireplace as if it would become the flame of the Iron Faith and swallow him whole. Dani, by his part, thread slowly. He laid out a loaf of bread and a plate of soup. He left the bath steaming. Set out a fresh cotton shirt, oversized, but soft. But the boy didn’t eat, didn’t bathe, didn’t speak. Neither did he disobey, he simply existed, as if speech would confirm that it had all happened.

However, the second night, it changed. The boy walked into the bathroom silently, and the sound of rippling water told Dani more than words could ever tell. The bread and soup were gone overnight, the shirt could be seen worn under the blanket. Dani didn’t ask him anything. He just sat across the room, quietly oiling a rifle that hadn’t needed oiling. The boy silently stared, not with fear or suspicion, but with curious reverence. “You… know how to keep tools.” Dani paused in the middle of the stroke. It was the first thing the boy had said in days. And it wasn’t about war, nor grief. It was about maintenance, about keeping things.

By the third day, Dani had realized he couldn’t keep calling him “The boy.” He hadn’t asked his name. It simply felt too wrong to ask. Instead, he set a small plaque by the fireplace alongside his, that read: “Rauk.” In Adler-Krähe tongue. “A name for one whom returned from ashes.” And the boy didn’t correct it.

By the end of the week, Rauk had his own cot. Dani tried to teach him how to take out chores, not to keep him busy, but rather because he didn’t know what else to do. He was not a father. He was barely a man after the war. He was a captain without a company, a soldier without front. And now he was a guardian for someone who fled the flames.

One night, Rauk was admiring the stars from the second floor window of the manor. Dani sat beside him with Bittermilch on his hand. A drink taught by The Innocent to The Martyred, albeit adapted to replace water with milk, the very first drink the Axantlii gave to those fleeing from the desolation that haunted the Great Wastelands. Rauk spoke. “We didn’t think… we just- we just saw how proud the humans were of their guns… and we wanted to show them we could build one too. But then it hit the cathedral… I don’t even know what a cathedral is…” Dani sipped slowly. “They say that’s where the war ended. Where they defeated the Teikoku. It’s not just a church to them, it’s a grave marker. And you hit it like a target,” Dani explained calmly. Rauk’s voice dropped to mere whisper. “We just wanted to be seen…” Dani didn’t answer yet. He set the mug down, and looked at the boy beside him. Not a soldier, not a warrior, not even a volp right now. Just a child. Just a boy who survived. “And now, you are.” Dani told him, seriously, yet honestly. “Now you can choose to be more than they saw.” He added.

In the following week, the estate became warmer. Rauk began organizing the library. Many of the books were on history, war, or metallurgy. He built a model of the High Tower, piece by piece, from memory. Dani never asked him to do so, he just watched. And when Rauk finally smiled, softly and shyly, Dani smiled back. “You're not done grieving.” “I know.” Rauk answered. “Yet you're still here.” Rauk nodded, then looked up at Dani. “So I can tell it, all of it. So no one forgets.” The fireplace cracked, now warming past and present. And the boy, who once feared the flames may consume him, now had a place to call home. He had someone to love.

Verse XII In the community, it slowly emerged. A side-eye here, a whisper there. At the market, the folks muttered. “That boy, is he the volp's son?” “He looks too quiet to be one.” “Do you think Forlun?-” But Dani just brushed the comments and steered conversations out of the topic. Sometimes he'd reply “Such is life,” or that he “wasn't sure how to fight that battle.” And although Rauk heard it all, he did not care. He'd walk nonchalantly down Lüpushal’s cobbled streets holding Dani's hand like a lifeline. Never did he bear the Ether rune again, he didn't speak of his family. He quietly integrated himself into Dani's life, and became his family.

Until a certain day came.

T’was morning, gray clouds looming above Dani's manor bearing rain. The fireplace was not yet lit. Rauk, barefoot and loosely-dressed, answered a knock on the door with a yawn still in his mouth. But then he froze. Two men stood there. Sable-Black uniforms, insignia of the SIH. One wore a deer skull as headpiece, antlers sawn and stylized. They were Inquisitors. They weren't just soldiers. They were the Guard of the Dead.

Rauk's heart thundered, he wanted to run, but his legs wouldn't move. “Is thy master present?” One of the men asked, calmly. Too calmly. “Who's at the door, Rauk-” Dani, who had just got casually dressed and was coming down the stairs, froze too. Then spat hot coffee. He rushed down in his battered coat still faintly reeking of coffee and ink. He saw the uniforms, the bleached antlered skull. “Herr Forlun.” The skull-wearing veteran addressed him. “With utmost sorrow we must inform you that the Volp valley has been… terminated. His excellencies, the Kaiser, and the Elk of Wolfstadt, express their most sincere condolences-.” He didn't finish. He didn't have to. He extended an ebon envelope, sealed in crimson wax. Beside it, inside a small coffee and atop a velvet cushion, lay a silver medal. Inscribed in Adler-Krähe: “The rightful from the wicked.” It glittered with bitterness in the morning sun.

No words followed. Not from Dani, not from Rauk.

The men simply turned away. The deer skull rattled solemnly as the wind whistled through its hollowed sockets. They left like ghosts. And still, neither Dani nor Rauk moved. They stood, frozen at the doorstep, the medal gleaming between them like a damned relic.

Hours passed. The fireplace wasn’t lit. Breakfast wasn't made. The envelope and medal lay untouched on the counter. At one point, Dani muttered, not fully to himself. “They… gave us a medal.” And Rauk didn’t answer. He sat cross-legged on the floor, blanket around him like burial cloth. Later that night, Dani found him asleep there, curled beside the fireplace. And he didn’t bother him. He just sat beside him, one hand over the boy, and let the silence stay amongst them.

Verse XIV The black envelope was heavy with contents. It made a dull thud when it hit the desk like stone on wood. Dani stared at it for a second. Rauk sat nearby, arms around his knees, slowly breathing. He did not ask Rauk if he wanted to hear. He just opened the envelope.

Two letters fell out.

One had a margin of gold leaf, spiced with regal aroma, oak and cinnamon. Its ink shimmered faintly in the candlelight, shining with dots of gold dust dried onto the paper, watermarked with the Kaiser’s imperial cypher. The other was lined only in silver, simpler in design, yet purer in its honesty. The ink was high-quality, but mortal. And was watermarked only with the Elk’s cypher, an elk with antlers stylized in a regal W. Dani frowned, then chuckled without much grace. “They didn’t even try to hide which is which,” he muttered. Rauk tilted his head slightly. That was all. Dani picked up the first, the gold lined one. He held it between his fingers like something sacred yet cursed. “This…” he murmured, “is The Ink.” Rauk looked up, confused. “The Ink,” Dani said again, softly, turning the letter to let the candlelight shine in the gold. “The kind used for only three things: Letters to the Axantlii… Letters to the GRF Queen… and declarations that override all law.” He explained. He smiled bitterly. “I once guarded an armored train carrying a single brick of it. We went deep into the Endloswald and back to the Capital. I thought I’d never see it again.” He sat down slowly, letter in hand. “And now they’ve used it… for me.” He smiled, but it quickly faded. His eyes narrowed. “Or rather, for you, Rauk.” He cleared his throat and began to read.

“To Herr Forlun, formerly of the 1st Volp Allied Fortress Regiment It is with a heavy heart and deepest sorrow that I acknowledge the cessation of the Volp Valley.” “(...)We understand no survivors were found.” “(...)We pray this act, however terrible, preserves the greater peace. Thou served with honor. May thou find purpose beyond this grief. Kaiser Maximilian VI.”

There was deafening silence. The words hung like fog in a trench. Dani didn’t comment. He just folded the letter, gently, reverently. Like a relic of something that had long burned to ashes. Then he picked up the Elk’s. The paper was creased, and there were faint, dried stains near the bottom. “Tears,” Dani said, softly. “I believe they’re real.” He read it with more sincerity, voice calmer and quieter, as if reading to someone in mourning.

“Dani, I will not pretend that words can make this right. I gave the order. I did. I trembled when I signed it. And I saw the Kaiser do the same. I do not ask you to forgive me. Only to know that I, or rather we, did not do this lightly. I know what that valley meant. I know who lived there.”

A pause.

“But I find a small peace in this: One of your men, someone from your own unit, reported seeing a young survivor walking eastward. I immediately dispatched six of your old battalion, sworn to silence, to discreetly escort him, to wherever he was going. I don’t know if he made it. I pray he did. The message arrived after the Kaiser decreed “no survivors,”. I’ve held my breath ever since. I suppose I’ll know whether he survived… The envoys must have noticed.

May you find peace in knowing he might yet live.

Willhelm I., Elk of Wolfstadt.”

Dani lowered the letter slowly, like lowering a flag after a battle lost. And for a while, neither of them said anything. The fireplace cracked softly. And then, a sound. Quiet. Barely audible. It was Rauk. He’d budged closer, his eyes locked on the two letters. There was a wetness in them, not tears, not anything. “I wasn’t… supposed to survive,” he said, voice steady and small. “They said there were no survivors.” Dani didn’t interrupt. “But they saw me.” He sniffed. “Someone saw me.”

And for the first time, Rauk leaned into Dani. Not like a warrior, not like a volp, not like a ghost. But like a child. A real one. He rested his head against Dani’s side. And Dani, with all his years of war and iron fierceness and duty, wrapped his arm around the boy only said: “You’re not just a survivor, Rauk. You’re the witness now.” Rauk looked up at him, teary, but with decisiveness in his eyes. “And I’ll make sure the world listens.”

And they stayed like that deep into the night. And nothing could break that moment. Not the Iron Faith. Not the Kaiser nor the Elk. Not even the Zorn Gottes. And for the first time since Rauk's world was burnt to ash, he felt like he was home. He had found a family. He had found a purpose.

`Prologue`

It was Monday morning, 6:00 A.M. The inhabitants of Beech View Townhouses were still slumbering peacefully, and there was a beautiful sunrise for anyone already awake to enjoy. It was the type of atmosphere where one would imagine Grieg’s “Morning Mood” to be playing if it were a Merrie Melodies skit. Very peaceful. Very serene.

And with a ***CRASH!*** the tranquility was over. The jolted-awake residents of the small townhouse complex then heard two distinct voices, one of a determined stepmother and the other of a defiant, voice-cracking adolescent, arguing loudly.

“I DON’T *WANT* EGGS FOR BREAKFAST! ***YOU CAN’T MAKE ME!”***

“YOU’LL *EAT* ‘EM AND ***LIKE*** ‘EM!”

*THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP* ***SLAM!*** The boy went sprinting out the front door, with a plate of eggs flying past his head and crashing into a nearby tree. The stepmother, still in her bathrobe and slippers, chased after him, but stopped at the end of the driveway, shaking her fist and screaming ultimatums. After her ungrateful stepspawn disappeared around the corner, she stalked back inside, straightening her hairpins and grumbling.

Once the daily show was over, the rubberneckers closed their windows and went back to their daily business.


`Chapter One`

Clark Simmons stomped into his first-period classroom and sat down heavily at his desk with a sour look on his face. That wench… why did it always have to be *eggs?* He was sick and tired of them! He did feel bad about making such a fuss about it, but to be fair, he wouldn’t have to if she didn’t keep on shoving them in his face like she did… He put the eggs aside from his mind and tried to pay attention to his math teacher, but to no avail. His focus drifted back to his stepmother. She had been on his back a lot more lately, ever since his birthday in September two months ago. Always asking him weird questions about doing drugs, his social media use, the friends he hung out with… One would think that now he was sixteen, she would give him more autonomy and trust. It wasn’t like he was doing drugs, or even had any social media accounts, or had any friends to hang out with.

Stupid eggs…


`Chapter Two`

I'm F.V. Carter, private eye. I had just hung up the horn with the unemployment agency when a broad entered my office.

”Are you a private detective?” she asked.
I replied that I was. We bumped gums for a while, and then she asked about my price.

”Twenty bucks, cash,” I said. ”If you can't fork over the dough, then breeze.”

The dame looked surprised, then gave me the up-and-down, as if I was goofy or something. Finally she gave me the mazuma, and told me her deal. She wanted me to tail her son.

“I’m worried that he’s hanging out with the wrong kind of people. He acts so secretive these days,” she jawed. “I need you to follow him and tell me if he gets up to anything illegal.”

“Eggs in the coffee.”

She gave me that funny look again, and dusted out. Honestly. It’s not like I’m crazy or anything. I know how to do my job, even if this *is* my first gig. I listen to Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar all the time. This sort of thing is duck soup!


`Chapter Three`

As Clark headed home, he began to get the funny feeling as if he was being watched. He kept on seeing odd shadows out of the corner of his eye, and hearing sticks crunching behind him as he walked through the shortcut. One time he looked behind him and saw a bush shaking, as if somebody had leapt inside it just as he began to turn around. He was too scared to check, though, and he ran all the rest of the way home.

The next day, he found a strange man hiding behind a telephone pole too narrow to conceal him.

“Are you following me?” Clark demanded, to which the man replied “You’re tooting the wrong ringer, see!” and ran off.

The horrible feeling got worse and worse as the week continued, and Clark began to fear for his life, and also doubt his sanity. What if this was all his imagination? Still, he decided to play it safe and find a new path to and from school. He made it as complicated as he could, weaving through alleyways, hiding behind garbage cans, and cutting through backyards to try to get the stalker off his trail.


`Chapter Four`

This kid was hinky, all right. Button man, dope peddler, or can-opener, he was up to no good. Furthermore, he was acting like he was trying to make a clean sneak, maybe to his dive, so I continued to tail him through garbage cans, pricker bushes, and other such booby traps. I even got all tangled up in someone’s laundry line once, but he still didn’t crab that I was on to him. All I have to do is tighten the screws, then I’m sure he’ll sing. I’m such a great sleuth! It was completely worth it to quit accounting.


`Chapter Five`

Clark was freaking out at this point. Was he being stalked? Was he going insane? He didn’t know. He decided to go to the grocery store along with his stepmother, both to protect her and to convince her to stop buying eggs. The entire time he was sweating and looking around, obviously enough that his stepmother asked him what was wrong. It was at that point that he saw that same strange man, hiding behind the orange display.

Clark screamed and ran for his life, dragging his stepmother with him. Oranges rolled like heads during the French Revolution as the stalker leapt over the display, tearing the Food Pyramid poster in half. The man pulled out a gun.


`Chapter Six`

“Hands up!” I commanded. “Ditch the hostage, or I pump lead!”

***POW!*** The kid went off the track and pasted me on the schnozzle, making 
me drop my roscoe. Blood spurted everywhere.

The psycho picked up my bean-shooter and aimed at me with intent to burn powder, but the bim squealed on the whole operation, telling him how she hired me as a gumshoe to rank him. The patsy stared at her with his yap hanging open.

*“You* did this to me? Why would you hire this *freak* to *stalk* me!?”

“It was for your own good, dear. I thought you might be doing illegal things with your riffraff friends.”

***“I don't have any friends!”***

“Oh? But you sit right next to that Jones boy in almost every class!”

“I sit next to him so I can *copy off his work!* How *else* would I be surviving
English and algebra? … um… Forget what I just said!”

Aha! So the crime this egg committed… was *plagiarism!* Case closed!

Satisfied with my good work, I took the opportunity to scram, leaving in my 
wake a puddle of blood and my squabbling clients.


`Epilogue`

That night, Clark cowered beneath his covers, with a baseball bat by his side. As much as he wanted to believe his stepmother, he knew that since she didn't trust him, he couldn't trust her. He watched each shadow pass by the window with trepidation, and tried to determine if each floor creak really *was* the house settling down. What if there was *another* stalker, one that *wasn't* his stepmother's doing? He couldn't afford to sleep a wink.

The Annapurna Base Camp Trek (ABC) is one of Nepal’s most popular treks. It’s a much easier and shorter walk than some of Nepal’s other high-altitude hikes. This journey includes a variety of terrain, culture, and wildlife. Along with the most breathtaking and up-close views of the Annapurna range, Machhapuchhre, Hiunchuli, and Dhaulagiri. Also, in this article, we will discuss the Annapurna Base Camp Elevation.

In the spring, it blooms with a variety of gorgeous flowers, including the Nepalese national flower, the Rhododendron. During the journey, you will be accompanied by orchids, the Machhapuchhre massif, and the deepest gorge in the world, the Kali Gandaki.

High cascading waterfalls can be seen on occasion. When you visit the Ghandruk museum, you will also learn about people of many ethnicities, particularly Gurung people.

However, depending on your path, you may or may not pass through Ghandruk. From Chomrung onwards, the track is the same, however, you can choose to include or exclude Ghorepani Poon Hill and Ghandruk. Poon hill provides a great view of Annapurna and other peaks, as well as dawn and sunset.

The hot springs are another highlight of this walk! For your sore muscles, this is a very calming and restorative treatment.

MBC also passes through ABC (Machhapuchhre Base Camp). What a wonderful experience. In one journey, visit two base camps!

These trails, together with the Annapurna Circuit, attract over 70% of all trekkers who visit Nepal.

 

# Trip Highlights

 

* View of Annapurna, Machhapuchhre, and Dhaulagiri Hot Springs from afar.
* Ghandruk’s Gurung Museum
* Flora and fauna from throughout the world
* The Kali Gandaki Gorge is the deepest in the world.
* Earthquake Update for Annapurna Base Camp

The terrible earthquakes that struck Nepal on April 25 and May 12 were kind to the Annapurna region. It took the least amount of damage. During an earthquake, fewer than 1% of the route and 3% of guesthouses were destroyed, according to Miyamoto International’s damage assessment report. The Annapurna Circuit trial, not the ABC trial, sustained the majority of the damage. As a result, the region welcomed trekkers throughout the autumn peak season (September-November).

By September of the same year, minor damages had been repaired, and the road had regained its charm. It’s back to normal now, as safe as it’s ever been.

 

# When is the best time to do Annapurna Base Camp trekking?

 

The Annapurna Base Camp hike can be done at any time of the year. However, the monsoon season is not ideal. The rain is strong in the evenings and at night, but gloomy clouds are always present. This implies that you won’t be able to see the lovely peaks. It also implies the presence of leeches, and insects, the possibility of landslides, and slick roadways. However, this is when animals are most active. If you’re a serious biologist, the monsoon season is ideal.

First, let’s look at the seasons. There are six seasons in Nepal, although they are translated as:

* Spring (March to May)
* Summer/Monsoon (June to August)
* Autumn (September to November)
* Winter (December to February)

This journey is best done in the autumn. Autumn is a dry season with clear skies and comfortable temperatures. This is the finest time to hike in Nepal and, as a result, it is extremely crowded. Along with this getting knowledge about the Annapurna Base Camp Elevation is important for the travel.

If you want it to be quieter, you may travel in December. ABC is also conceivable in the winter. Dry air and clear skies provide the finest visibility, but it will be very cold and snowy during the winter. If you’re planning a hike in December, make sure you’re well-prepared with the right gear.

When traveling from Deurali to Machhapuchhre Base Camp starting in January, you must be cautious of avalanches.

Avalanche danger exists throughout this stretch. Trekkers should exercise caution when trekking from Deurali to MBC, regardless of the time of year.

The Annapurna Base Camp trek is also best done in the spring. However, keep an eye out for the avalanche. Listen to the locals for information about the impending avalanche. The trail will be blooming with red and white rhododendrons, as well as many other exotic flowers native to this region, in the spring, making it a good time to visit for botanists.

 

# Annapurna Base Camp trek route/itinerary

 

There are two or three ways to get to ABC. You can create a variety of itineraries using this information. At Chomrong, all routes meet and follow the same way to the base camp.

The trail can take a direct route to Annapurna Base Camp, a detour to Ghorepani Poon Hill, a lesser diversion to Ghandruk, or both. Climbing and returning stops can be made in different villages. Taking other routes, of course, adds or subtracts 3-4 days. Along with this getting knowledge about the Annapurna Base Camp Elevation is important for travel.

Here’s an example of a trip itinerary. Ghorepani Poon Hill is traversed via this trail. In general, the hike begins in Pokhara and ends in Phedi before returning to Pokhara.

 

# Outlined Itinerary of Annapurna Base Camp Trek

 

***Note: The following numbers denote the number of days that you will be spending at the Annapurna Base Camp Trek.***

1 Kathmandu to Pokhara (By flight or Bus)  
2 Drive to Nayapul and trek to Ulleri  
3 Trek to Ghorepani  
4 Early treks to Poon Hill for Sunrise, Back to Ghorepani, and Trek to Tadapani  
5 Tadapani to Chomrong  
6 Chomrong to Dobhan (Dovan)  
7 Dovan to Deurali  
8 Deurali to Machhapuchhre Base Camp (MBC)  
9 MBC to Annapurna Base Camp  
10 Trek to Bamboo  
11 Trek to Jhinudanda (Hot spring in Jhinudanda)  
12 Jhinu Danda to Pothana/Jhinu Danda to Ghandruk  
13 Pothana to Phedi and drive to Pokhara/ Ghandruk to Nayapul and drive to Pokhara

Furthermore, we believe Ghanduk is a more attractive settlement, but Pothana is equally attractive. Also, going through Ghorepani is preferable to marching straight up to ABC and back.

Where to stay in Pokhara before and after the trek. Along with this getting knowledge about the Annapurna Base Camp Elevation is important for travel.

Pokhara is designed for pre- and post-tourists, with gear rental businesses, cafes, massage centers, and nice lodging.

We appreciated the amenities of Pokhara Backpackers Hostel as budget backpackers, which featured wonderfully comfy, light rooms, luggage storage alternatives while hiking, and a wealth of useful information.

The magnificent Hotel Batika is a nicer option with private rooms with balconies and attached bathrooms if you’re seeking a nicer option.

 

# Temperatures on the Annapurna Base Camp Trek

 

The weather is typically comfortable during the day, and once you’ve warmed up, a t-shirt will suffice for hiking, with a warmer layer to put on when you stop. The temperature drops drastically at night, so bring a couple of extra garments. Expect temperatures to drop below zero at night at the base camp (we were there in April) and minus 10 degrees Celsius further down. Along with this getting knowledge about the Annapurna Base Camp Elevation is important for travel.

 

# Trekking Permits and Costs for Annapurna Base Camp

 

* Two permits are required to trek to Annapurna Base Camp.

* A pair of crocs
* There are four pairs of liner socks in all. Two pairs for hot weather and two pairs for cold weather.
* Trekking/liner socks are preferable, but it’s fine if you only have regular socks.There are only a few pairs of underwear. You can get hiking underwear at your local store. They’re also great for other outdoor activities. Normal underwear is available in Nepal.
* A down pants and a high-quality ultralight packable down jacket. In Nepal, you can buy or rent a nice down jacket and down pants for $1 or less each day.
* T-shirts and pants, keeping in mind that you’ll be walking in both chilly and warm weather.

# Is Annapurna Base Camp Trek difficult?

 

The Annapurna Base Camp Trek is a moderately graded walking circuit that covers 70 kilometers in ten days. This walk is one of the most gratifying, but it also needs some proactive planning to reach this goal. Cardio activity, running, regular juggling, and stretching for a few weeks prior to the trips are all wonderful ways to improve your stamina. This walk is easily completed by people with average fitness levels and beginner trekkers; nevertheless, for beginners, sufficient supervision of the mountain climate, atmosphere, and environment is required. However, the more fit and experienced we are, the easier and more adventurous the journey will be. Along with this getting knowledge about the Annapurna Base Camp Elevation is important for travel.

This trek is typically suitable for trekkers who are able to hike for 5-7 hours per day with a medium and light-day pack. The Rocky Mountains, steep ascents and descents, small routes, riverbanks, straight trails, and occasionally slippery and snowy trails are all part of the course. Before beginning your walk, it is critical that you are as healthy as possible.

 

# Food, Accommodation, and their Cost during Annapurna Base Camp trekking

 

The cost of staying in a lodge is about $2 per day. A private room with twin beds or a dorm room with 4-6 beds can be rented. They’re small, but they’re comfortable and well-kept.

There are more luxurious hotels that cost significantly more, but regular teahouses cost around $2. Luxury hiking entails staying in these opulent accommodations. They are more expensive. Luxury trekking is not required for the ABC journey in terms of ‘comfort against the weatheAlong with this getting knowledge about the Annapurna Base Camp Elevation is important for the travel.r.’

Locals expect you to dine at your lodging. Teahouses make money by selling meals instead of accommodation. You’d agree that $2 is a lot less. You have a variety of meal alternatives to pick from. Eggs can be prepared in a variety of ways, as well as chapatti, milk cereals, and sandwiches. Alternatively, potatoes are ready in various ways, package noodles, chowmein, momo, macaroni, pudding, Dal Bhat Tarkari, and other dishes are available. The cheapest and most filling option is dal bhat. Tea, coffee, flavored hot drinks, and other beverages are available. They also sell alcoholic beverages.

On average, $25 a day will cover three meals and several cups of hot coffee, regardless of what you consume. Alcohol is not allowed in this budget. If you’re going to drink, do so on the way back. Caffeine and alcohol make you more susceptible to AMS. What you should know about AMS is as follows:

 

# What is AMS?

 

Anyone traveling above 2400 meters should be aware of AMS. AMS has the potential to be fatal.

Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), often known as altitude sickness, is the body’s reaction to being at a high elevation. At higher altitudes, our bodies react to decreased air pressure and lower oxygen content.

You’re experiencing headaches, nausea, vomiting, a loss of appetite, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. Do not dismiss the signs and symptoms. It isn’t going to get any better in a hurry. Rather, it will only worsen, eventually leading to deadly illnesses such as HAPE or HACE. if you don’t give it the attention it deserves. You must relax properly before continuing downhill. Along with this getting knowledge about the Annapurna Base Camp Elevation is important for travel.

If you have AMS, the best thing you can do is stop ascending. Return to your starting point and descend, or stay at the same elevation for the rest of the day. The majority of people acclimate in one day, however, it can take up to three days for certain people. Diamox aids in the acclimatization process. If things don’t improve, descend.

The Annapurna Base Camp hike takes you to a height of nearly 4000 meters. As a result, it is critical to take preventive steps such as staying hydrated, eating well, and rising slowly.

 

# Some Tips for Annapurna Base Camp trekking

 

Here are a few ideas that might come in handy while ABC Trek.

* Except for meat, if you order a Nepali meal set or Dal Bhat Tarkari, you can have seconds and thirds for free. You may eat as much as you want.
* Carry enough cash with you on the ABC route because there are no ATMs.
* Set about $150 to cover transportation and admission to monasteries and museums.
* Add a few extra days in case you need one more day to acclimate. You might also like to go somewhere else.
* Don’t believe everything you hear from the locals. Bad people can be found almost anywhere. If you ask how far it is to place A, they may tell you that you have arrived in order to get you to stay in their tea house. That is not the case for everyone. The majority are pleasant and helpful.
* If you don’t think you’ll need the expensive equipment in the future, you can rent it instead of buying it.
* Public displays of affection are frowned upon, and wearing revealing clothing will bring you unwanted attention.
* Along with this getting knowledge about the Annapurna Base Camp Elevation is important for the travel.
* It is impolite to click on individuals without their consent. Ask them first if it’s okay to photograph them.
* Food may take a bit longer to cook. Place your order as soon as possible.
* Take the necessary precautions to avoid AMS and altitude sickness.

People have grown accustomed to collecting gratuities. Tipping is a westerner-created culture, hence there is no predetermined amount. They will be grateful for whatever you decide to give them. If you’re still unsure, trekkers have set the threshold at 15% of the overall salary. Along with this getting knowledge about the Annapurna Base Camp Elevation is important for travel.

For example, $20 each day multiplied by ten days becomes $200. As a result, a 15% tip equals $30. This is sufficient. 30 dollars = 3000 rupees (roughly). So, depending on your level of happiness, you might tip anywhere between Rs.2500 and Rs.4000.

This is solely for porters and guides. Tipping taxi drivers and restaurant employees are not important. If you insist on tipping waiters, the typical payment is 10% of the bill. However, these are already in the service price.

# Conclusion

 

I hope this information assists you in choosing and arranging your trip to Annapurna Base Camp.",1,1752991268.0,u_uniquepath122321,0,1.0,False
1m4hj0v,https://i.redd.it/qbbakd71zydf1.png,Kiddo's assignment 🥲,"      I’m only 14..okay 13 going on 14. I haven’t been in love, not the way they show it in movies or the way adults talk about it. I haven’t had someone to hold hands with in secret or write cheesy messages to at midnight. But that doesn’t mean I don’t know anything about love.

     I’ve seen it. I see it every day... in my mom.

     She doesn’t have to say she’s in love for me to know. I can tell by how her eyes light up when her phone buzzes and she sees his name. I can tell by the way she suddenly sings loudly and out of tune, or the way she stares at her coffee like she’s remembering something warm. I can even tell by how she sighs when she’s missing him, or how quiet she gets when they’ve had a fight.

     Love shows up in all the little things. In the way she puts on a lighter make up when they meet. In the smile she tries to hide when she thinks no one’s looking. In the way she gets upset, not because she hates him, but because she cares. And I’ve seen her cry too... not just tears of pain, but of wanting something to work so badly it hurts. That’s love, too.

     I know love isn’t always pretty. I’ve seen it make her glow, but I’ve also seen it make her tired. I’ve heard her laugh at her phone screen like she’s 16 again, and I’ve heard her whisper “I don’t know what to do” when she thinks I’m asleep. But no matter what, she keeps choosing him. Again and again. And I think that’s what real love looks like not just butterflies, but also effort.

    So no, I haven’t been in love. But I know it’s more than just kisses and heart emojis. It’s showing up, even on the hard days. It’s fighting but not giving up. It’s worrying, waiting, understanding, forgiving. It’s smiling at your phone for no reason. It’s hurting sometimes, but still hoping.

   I don’t know what kind of love I’ll have one day. But I do know that when I find it, I’ll recognize it because I’ve seen it, right here at home.",3,1752991262.0,AlasFeels,1,1.0,False
1m4hik6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_-xXdarkXx-/comments/1m4hik6/the_night_side_of_the_house_extended_version/,"**""The Night Side of the House"" (Extended Version)**","You think you know your home. Every corner, every creak, every crack beneath the windowsill. You think nothing new appears there at night, in the dark. But that’s not true.  

There’s a boundary: when you sit in silence for too long, unblinking, undistracted, the room begins to show its other side. The one you can’t see during the day. **The night side of the house.** And one day, it happened to Andrei.  

He moved into the apartment in November. A standard two-room flat in a prefab high-rise. A five-story building, like all the others on the outskirts of the city. Damp corners, yellowed wallpaper, stains on the ceiling, the smell of dust and old wood. But the price was low, and the landlady was in a hurry to sell. She said over the phone that she was moving to another city, closer to her daughter—grandkids, family matters. When he came to see the place, everything seemed normal. So what if there were cobwebs in the corners, if the door hinges squeaked? Just an old apartment.  

Still, something did unsettle him back then.  

On the inside of the front door, someone had carved a word with a knife. Tiny, barely visible under the varnish: **""REMEMBER.""** What exactly to remember—unclear. Like a warning left unfinished.  

In the stairwell, a message in marker: **""DON’T LOOK INTO THE CORNER.""**  

He laughed it off at the time. People scribble nonsense in hallways all the time. Probably just kids messing around. Or some local lunatic.  

Andrei moved in. Unpacked his boxes, arranged his things. Set up the internet. Ordered groceries for the week. Life went on as usual.  

For the first two weeks, everything was fine.  

He worked on his laptop, drank coffee, watched TV shows. Stayed up late, woke up in the evening—lived the way he always had.  

But in the third week, things began to change.  

At first, it was small. The clocks in the apartment were always four minutes fast. All of them—his phone, laptop, kitchen timer, even the old wall clock he’d hung up himself. All running four minutes ahead.  

It was strange. He’d step outside—his phone showed the correct time. Come back inside—four minutes ahead again.  

No matter how many times he reset them, the moment he crossed the threshold, time sped up again.  

At first, he blamed fatigue. Four minutes—what’s the big deal?  

But with each passing day, it felt more pronounced. As if time in the apartment moved to its own rhythm. Four minutes—like a tear in reality. Like his home wasn’t quite **here** anymore, but slightly offset from the present.  

Then came the sounds.  

This wasn’t the usual ""house settling."" Not neighbors, not pipes, not the elevator.  

Every night, at exactly **3:44 AM**, a strange noise came from the wall behind the couch. Like someone slowly dragging their hand along the **other side** of the wallpaper. Not the side he could see—the **inside**.  

The rustling was so quiet that at first, he thought it was his imagination. But it repeated every night, at the same time.  

He tried to ignore it. The less you think about weird things, the sooner they go away, right?  

By the fourth week, he realized: this wasn’t going away.  

One night, he couldn’t sleep. Sat in the armchair, stared at the monitor, listened to the hum of the refrigerator in the corner.  

At **3:44 AM**, it started.  

He took off his headphones and listened. The same sound—rustling, sliding, like a palm gliding along the inside of the wall.  

He stood up and approached the wall.  

The sound stopped. But when he pressed his hand against the wallpaper, he felt it—a faint pulse. As if something behind the drywall was breathing.  

The next morning, he called the previous owner.  

—""Hello,"" he said, ""sorry, but I wanted to ask about something…""  
—""You’ve heard it already, haven’t you?"" the woman interrupted.  
—""Heard what?""  
—""Well… what people usually hear. Those who live there.""  
—""What was I supposed to hear?""  
—""It scratches, doesn’t it?""  

He fell silent.  

—""You know what?"" she said. ""I can’t talk about this. Don’t call me again.""  

She hung up. Then disconnected the number.  

After that, things only got worse.  

Every night, Andrei began hearing new sounds. Near the ceiling. A faint tapping, like someone dragging a fingernail across the concrete slab above. First one tap, then two, then three. A pattern he couldn’t decipher.  

Sometimes, he caught himself counting along.  
*""One… two… three…""*  
Pause.  
*""One… two… three…""*  
Then he’d realize—he hadn’t started counting. Something **inside him** was doing it for him.  

He became afraid to sleep.  

At some point, he noticed that if he stared at the window too long, his reflection stopped moving in sync. He’d turn his head—the reflection stayed still. Then jerked to catch up, like a lagging video call.  

Once, after finally falling asleep, he woke up to find a recording on his phone. He didn’t remember turning on the voice memo, but there it was. Three in the morning.  

His own voice whispered:  
**""Stop sleeping on your back. You know they’re there.""**  

After that, he only slept on his side. If he ever rolled onto his back, he’d wake up paralyzed. And feel something standing over him. Right above his face. Breathing into his eyes.  

Sometimes, he’d see something in the corner of the room, behind the wardrobe. A figure, almost human—but stretched too long. As if pulled upward like taffy. It always stood in the darkest corner, where the walls met the ceiling.  

He tried not to look there.  

On the fifth day, Andrei set up a camera.  

He placed it on the wardrobe, aimed it at the room, and hit record.  

He woke up, as usual, at four in the morning. Lying on his side. Breathing fast, heart pounding in his ears.  

He grabbed his phone and checked the footage.  

The first four hours were normal. Him sleeping on the couch, tossing and turning, pulling the blanket over himself.  

Then… the camera froze. The image locked. But the timer kept running.  

And in that frozen frame, in the darkest corner of the room, another face appeared.  

Nothing human about it.  

Pale, blank. No eyes, no mouth. Just smooth skin with barely visible nostrils. And this ""face"" slowly slid down the wall like a drop of liquid.  

When the timer hit **3:44 AM**, the camera glitched. The screen showed Andrei’s face.  

Close-up. Staring straight into the lens. Eyes completely empty.  

He didn’t remember that moment.  

After that, he stopped using the camera. Deleted all the files. But the next day, he got an email.  

Sender: a random string—**[qkkZl-p0tl0K@outlook.com]

The message contained one word:  

**""THANK YOU.""**  

And an attached video.  

He didn’t open it. He already knew what was inside.  

From that day on, he understood: the apartment had another layer. A shadow copy. A second version of the flat. Its own time. Its own rules.  

**The night side of the house.**  

That’s where they live—the ones who watch from the corners. The ones who don’t like it when you sleep facing up. The ones who can wake you up on the floor even though you fell asleep on the couch.  

He couldn’t leave. When he tried, the taxi driver said he’d already taken a ride and come back.  

He didn’t remember that.  

He couldn’t throw out the mirrors—they already showed **a different apartment**.  

Older. Foreign. The one that existed **before this building was even here**.  

Sometimes, he saw himself in them. But not as he was now.  

There was another him. Skin sagging. Eye sockets hollow.  

And that ""him"" stood by the door, waiting for Andrei to **step outside**, so they could switch places.  

---  

Now, Andrei lives in the hallway. Doesn’t turn on the lights. Doesn’t look into corners.  

He knows: if he lies on his back, a hand will stretch down from the ceiling. Long, thin. With heels instead of palms.  

Sometimes, he hears whispering behind the radiator:  

**""Give up your room. You’ll be on the other side soon anyway.""**  

And he knows it’s true. Because the clocks in the apartment are four minutes fast.  

And when the countdown ends, he’ll have to open the door.  

And on the other side, he’s already standing there.",1,1752991225.0,u_-xXdarkXx-,0,0.99,False

I met him and he's a major gym bro. We're basically opposites, with him outgoing and me being introverted but I decided to give it a shot anyway since it seemed like he was pretty easygoing.

Anyway fast forward a couple months and this guy leaves his gym equipment literally EVERYWHERE. He leaves his sweaty clothes are all around the apartment and is always walking around with his shirt off (he has ginornmous pecs) and always leaves the blender in the sink uncleaned with his disgusting protein shakes. At the same time he always blames me for being unorganized and leaving my books around.

So about those books. Basically I read gay comics called yaoi. They look pretty innocent to the unknown person with the characters often looking like girls but they're infact men, so I thought It'd be ok to not hide them. Who opens random books that arent theirs anyway? Apparently one day he was sick of me leaving my books stacked up on the coffee table and he tried to gather them all in his arms and ended up dropping one and it happened to fall open on one of the more nsfw scenes (do not ask the book title or the chapter of said scenes.)

He accused me of putting pornography out in the open and I replied It's just gay romance books. He got even angrier at me and started yelling.

1m4hgct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/1m4hgct/is_this_typical_dating_a_norwegian_woman_this_was/,Is this typical dating a Norwegian woman?? This was my experience dating one.,"Hi all,

So, I am 30M American man and I just got out of a relationship with a Norwegian woman 24F who I met on a dating app while visiting my brother who lives there. It was definitely one of the most interesting experiences and was curious if this is typical dating a Norwegian girl.

First off going on a casual date is not in their vocabulary. She didn’t even like the word date when we first talked until I explained to her it’s very common for people in the US to go out for coffee, lunch, or a quick drink when first meeting someone. That was not her thing at all. She wanted to meet at the beach and every other hangout after that was at her house.

Secondly, a lot of push and pull away action. She would be very affectionate, planning trips, wanting to see me but then out of the blue she wouldn’t want to hang for a couple days. It was odd. But then she wouldn’t really want to see me after that. Was a very hot and cold relationship. Almost like her social battery would get depleted sometimes.

Third point would be pretty quick to sex. It’s not terribly uncommon in the US for “hook ups” or quick to bed but I like to have at least a few dates first. She thought that was very odd and said I made her wait the longest for sex but she respected it. She said Norway has the highest rates of one night stands in the world? Is that true?

4th point would be there isn’t a lot of commitment in the beginning at least. We both we were very committed to each other but she said it’s not uncommon for girls/guys to casually date multiple people until one sticks around? She didn’t like participating in that but she said that’s kind of the culture but I thought it was crazy she had a friend that was seeing a guy for 6-8 months and still was dating other guys. I feel a couple casual dates doesn’t make you exclusive but I do feel after a month or so it should be obvious personally.

5th and final point would be that she felt like Norwegian men are kind of lame when it comes to dating and not very romantic people. She thought it was almost crazy that I got her flowers on multiple occasions and was trying to show effort.

Anyways, long story short we ended up breaking up due to being long distance but was curious if this sound about typical in Norwegian dating culture? Thanks!",8,1752991006.0,Norway,7,0.68,False

**Part 1: Roadkill and Radio Static**

I didn’t believe the local stories at first.

It was my sister’s idea to rent a cabin in Arizona. Middle of nowhere. No cell towers, no signal. Nothing but forest, dust, and the sound of cicadas buzzing like broken phone lines. We were supposed to “disconnect.” She said it would be good for us.

Her name’s Harlow, but she always goes by “Lo.” I don’t remember why we started calling her that. It just stuck. Shorter. Snappier. She liked things clean, efficient. Her sentences. Her wardrobe. Her knife collection.

My name’s Isabel. She calls me “Izzy.” I hate it, but I let her.

We hadn’t seen each other in over a year, not since our last big fight. I don’t even remember what that one was about—probably something stupid, like the voiceover mic she never returned. But the second she picked me up in her beat-up Honda, I knew she was up to something.

“You’ll love this place,” she said, her sunglasses too big for her face, her mouth twitching into that little smile she gets when she’s lying.

The drive took eight hours. Somewhere past Phoenix, the scenery got weird. No towns. No gas stations. No landmarks, unless you count the dead animals lining the shoulder. We must’ve passed over a dozen—rabbits, deer, even a coyote once. All cleanly split open like they’d been autopsied.

I asked Lo if she noticed.

She just nodded and turned up the radio.

That’s when it started.

The radio wasn’t picking up any stations—not even static. Just this low hum. Like something between a broken dial tone and someone breathing through a paper bag.

I went to switch it off, but Lo slapped my hand.

“Don’t touch it.”

I stared at her. She kept her eyes on the road. Knuckles white on the wheel.

“It’s just part of the drive,” she said.

“What does that mean?”

She didn’t answer.

# Part 2: Pine Needles in the Sink

The cabin didn’t show up on GPS. No address, no map pin, nothing. We had to follow hand-written directions Lo printed off Reddit. The ink had bled where she spilled something, and one of the arrows curved backward.

We reached the place just before sunset.

It wasn’t a cabin so much as a lopsided shack with green-tinted windows and a satellite dish growing rust like lichen. The pines surrounding it leaned a little too close, like they were listening.

When I stepped inside, it smelled like rain and old wood. Like someone had been there just minutes before.

“Where’d you find this?” I asked.

“Friend of a friend,” Lo said. She was already unpacking a backpack full of VHS tapes. “They said it was haunted.”

I froze. “You brought horror movies?”

“No,” she said, grinning. “These are field recordings.”

She handed me a tape with a label written in Sharpie: **“November 9 – Pineside Screamer (Confirmed?)”**

“You’re joking,” I said.

But she wasn’t.

The cabin had an old TV with a built-in VCR. She pushed in the tape, and static crackled across the screen.

We sat down on the dusty floor, backs against the couch.

The video was grainy and black-and-white. It showed a forest trail at night. Moonlight flickered through the trees, casting long shadows. A handheld camera bobbed as someone whispered into it.

“There it is,” the voice said. “Standing near the ridge.”

The camera zoomed shakily into the distance.

A figure stood at the edge of a clearing—tall, thin, limbs slightly too long. It didn’t move, not even when the person filming gasped and stepped on a branch.

Then, it turned.

Its face was wrong. Like it had been copied and pasted from someone else’s face—but stretched, warped. Familiar in a way that made my stomach twist.

Suddenly, the screen cut to static.

Lo hit eject and looked at me like I’d just passed a test.

“Well?” she asked.

“Well, what?”

“You see it, don’t you?”

“See what?”

She leaned in close. “That thing… it wears people.”

# Part 3: They Never Whisper First

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

The cabin made too many noises. Groans from the wooden beams. Wind whistling like it was trying to pronounce something. At one point, I heard something drip, drip, dripping in the kitchen, even though we hadn’t used any water.

I got up to check.

The faucet was off, but there was a puddle in the sink. Pine needles floated in it. I swear I saw something twitch under the water.

I didn’t tell Lo. She was still awake, sitting cross-legged by the TV, headphones on, watching another one of her tapes.

She always had a thing for recordings—old cassettes, shortwave radio, police dispatches. Said she liked voices better than faces. Easier to trust.

“You’re not hearing this?” I asked her.

She pulled the headphones down to her neck. “What?”

“That… breathing sound.”

“Izzy, the forest is full of animals. Maybe it’s just a bear.”

“That’s not a bear,” I said. “It sounds like… like it’s inside the walls.”

Lo didn’t answer. She pressed play again.

I went back to bed and stared at the ceiling. That’s when I heard it. From the trees outside.

A voice.

It sounded exactly like **me.**

“Izzy,” it called. The inflection was perfect. Casual. A little annoyed, like I get when she steals the covers.

“Izzy, come help me. I dropped something.”

I sat up.

Lo was still in the other room.

“Izzy…”

My duplicate voice got closer. Too close. Right outside the window.

I moved quietly and peeked through the blinds.

The forest looked still. But between two pines stood a figure — tall, wrong-jointed. Its head was tilted. Its mouth didn’t move. But I still heard it.

“Izzy… don’t make me ask again.”

I backed away.

Lo must’ve heard me stumble because she appeared in the doorway with a flashlight.

She didn’t say anything. Just looked at me. Listened.

Then she whispered, “They never whisper first.”

# Part 4: Harlow's Tapes

We didn’t sleep.

Lo boiled stale coffee at 3:00 a.m. while I sat on the floor with a blanket around my shoulders, clutching a kitchen knife I found in a drawer. I didn’t remember grabbing it.

She didn’t speak until I asked the question I’d been avoiding.

“What the hell is going on?”

She didn’t look up from the stove.

“You ever hear of *recording residue*?” she said.

“Like ghost stuff?”

“Not exactly. Sometimes… when something traumatic happens, it gets trapped. In the air. In the wood. In the dirt. People think it’s memory. But it’s more like… a fingerprint.”

I stared at her.

“Lo, are you telling me those VHS tapes are *real*?”

She turned. Her face was pale, but not afraid.

“I made them.”

I blinked. “You made the footage?”

“No. I mean… I *recorded* them. But I didn’t film them.”

She set down the kettle and pulled a tape from her bag. It was unmarked. The plastic casing was warped—melted at the corner, like it had been too close to something hot.

She pushed it into the VCR.

The screen lit up. A different cabin. Different woods. A man in a wheelchair sitting on a porch, shotgun across his lap. A young girl—six, maybe seven—crouched beside a golden retriever.

The camcorder was shaky. Zoomed in, like the person filming wasn’t supposed to be there.

I felt something cold settle in my spine.

The man said something we couldn’t hear.

The girl smiled. The dog wagged its tail.

And then— A single, deafening shot.

The dog dropped.

The girl screamed. The man didn’t move. His head tilted ever so slightly. Toward the camera. Toward *us*.

Then something else happened—something I can barely describe.

The girl’s voice changed. She screamed again, but the pitch warped—too deep, too many layers, like other voices were screaming *through her*.

Lo hit eject.

I didn’t say anything. My hands were shaking.

“That was you,” I finally whispered.

She nodded slowly.

“My grandpa,” she said. “He was paralyzed from the waist down. But he could still shoot. I was never sure if he meant to hit the dog… or if he *missed* trying to hit me.”

We sat in silence.

And then Lo said something that broke me:

“That was the first time I saw it. The thing in the woods. It was behind the camera. Watching.”

# Part 5: Where the Pines Bend

The next morning was too quiet.

The woods around the cabin, once filled with wind and birdsong, now pressed in with silence so loud it rang in my ears.

Lo stood on the porch in boots and a jacket, taping a flashlight to the end of a metal rod like it was a homemade spear.

“We need to go back,” she said.

“Back where?”

“The place I buried it.”

She didn’t explain.

I didn’t argue.

We set off into the trees, moving east where the sun filtered through the pine needles like dying projector light. Every few yards, we passed something strange: a pile of feathers in a perfect circle. An upside-down deer skull hanging from a branch. A cassette tape nailed to a tree trunk, unspooled, its black ribbon waving in the breeze like a flag.

I stopped walking.

“Lo, what the hell is all this?”

“They’re warnings,” she said, not looking back. “From it.”

“From *what*, Lo?”

She just said, “You’ll see.”

Eventually, we reached a small clearing. The ground there looked like it had been recently disturbed—like something had clawed its way *out*.

Lo knelt and started to dig.

Beneath the soil was a box. Plastic. Weathered. She pulled it up and opened it slowly.

Inside were several things: – An old Polaroid of Lo and her dog. – A cassette tape with “DO NOT PLAY” written in red ink. – A ziplock bag full of teeth. Not human.

I stepped back.

“Why did you bury this?”

She didn’t answer right away. She pulled out the tape and held it up to the light like it was precious.

“I thought if I gave it something personal,” she whispered, “it would leave me alone.”

“You thought you could *bargain* with it?”

“No,” she said, voice cracking. “I thought I could *trade*.”

That’s when the wind shifted.

And from the trees, a voice called out.

“Harlow…”

It was soft. Familiar.

It was her *mother’s* voice.

But Lo’s mom had been dead for five years.

“Don’t answer,” I hissed.

Lo gripped my hand.

The voice came again. But this time it changed.

“Harlow… I see you.”

And now… it sounded like **me.**

# Part 6: Playback

We ran.

Not away. Deeper. Toward whatever the forest had swallowed.

The voice followed, darting between trees like a skipping record.

“I see you…”

“Don’t go…”

“Please… don’t let him shoot the dog again…”

I froze.

That last voice… was me.

Not just my voice — my phrasing. My tone. Saying something I *never said* — but somehow *knew*.

Lo turned to me, breathless, pale. “It’s starting. It’s *remembering us.*”

We stumbled into another clearing.

At the center stood a metal structure — rusted radio tower, maybe fifteen feet high, surrounded by broken satellite dishes and a rotting shack with a warped wooden door. The door was open. Inside, something glowed.

Lo walked in first.

I followed.

The room was dark except for a desk lined with equipment — a reel-to-reel tape machine, a speaker, a mic with cracked foam. Dust coated everything. But the tape machine was *on*. Spinning slowly. Recording.

A single chair sat before it. And on the chair — a cassette.

Lo picked it up. There was no label.

She slid it into her Walkman and put in the headphones.

Then she went completely still.

“Lo?” I whispered.

She handed me the headphones.

I put them on.

The tape played my voice.

But not *my* voice. Not one I remembered recording. It was me — panicked, whispering.

“If you find this… I think it already knows you. Don’t let it speak *in your voice.* That’s how it gets in. That’s how it rewrites you.”

I stopped breathing.

“Lo’s already changing. I can see it in her eyes. She’s smiling with her mouth but not her face.”

Then, the whisper turned low. Like it was inside my ear.

“You’ve been here before.”

I tore off the headphones.

Lo was staring at me. But her expression was… wrong.

“Izzy,” she said.

I flinched.

Her tone was flat. The warmth was gone.

“Izzy,” she repeated. “Don’t you want to stay this time?”

# Part 7: Pre-Echo

*Lo didn’t blink.*

*She stood in the doorway of the shack, mouth barely parted, eyes unfocused like her soul was buffering.*

*“Lo…” I whispered. “What’s my name?”*

*She hesitated.*

*“...Hollow,” she said.*

*That wasn’t my name.*

*I ran.*

*I crashed through the woods until my lungs burned. Behind me, trees groaned. Something followed — not on foot, but in sound. Leaves crunching in the wrong places. My own breathing echoed twice, once in my chest, and once somewhere off to my right, like something was practicing being me.*

*I didn’t realize where I was going until I saw the ground split open.*

*A sinkhole.*

*Half-covered by pine needles and brush, a circular gap in the earth, leading down into dark stone steps. Not natural. Made. Carved. Ancient.*

*I should’ve turned back.*

*I went down.*

*Each step groaned under my weight. The air grew colder, damper. The walls were covered in moss and crude carvings—eyes, mouths, symbols made of intersecting triangles.*

*At the bottom was a single room.*

*And in the room… dozens of reel-to-reel machines.*

*All spinning.*

*All recording.*

*None were plugged in.*

*And all of them were playing voices I recognized.*

*“Izzy, stop messing around.”*

*“You seriously brought that to a cabin?”*

*“What if it never lets us leave?”*

*My voice. Lo’s voice. Sometimes arguing. Sometimes laughing. But one voice stood out.*

*A deep male voice.*

*Old. Crackling. Southern accent.*

*“I told him not to name the damn dog. Boy cried like a baby. Thought I missed. Truth is, I didn’t.”*

*My blood went cold.*

*“I aimed for him. That damn dog just moved faster.”*

*I covered my mouth.*

*That was* ***Hunter’s grandfather.***

*The words hit like a memory that wasn’t mine — but felt carved into me.*

*The machines kept spinning.*

*And suddenly, I understood.*

*This place… doesn’t record the past.*

*It records what it wants to happen.*

*And it plays it back until it becomes true.*

# Part 8: Loops and Likeness

*I stumbled out of the chamber like I was being born again.*

*The forest was darker now — like it had aged a few decades in the hour I’d been below. The trees looked taller, bark warped like old skin. Everything smelled like static and wet iron.*

*Lo was waiting for me.*

*But it wasn’t Lo.*

*She looked like her. She sounded like her.*

*But the eyes were just a little too wide. The smile a second too slow. And when she said, “Izzy… there you are,” my stomach clenched like I’d heard it before — a hundred times, in a hundred different failed endings.*

*“You’re not her,” I said.*

*Her smile didn’t change.*

*“I’ve been her longer than you’ve been you.”*

*She stepped toward me.*

*I backed away.*

*“Why are you doing this?” I asked.*

*Her head tilted. “You’re the one who keeps coming back.”*

*She raised a hand, palm up. Something shimmered in her fingers.*

*A cassette.*

*The label read:* ***“Final Loop – Izzy Ver. 44”***

*I shook my head.*

*“No… no, this is the first time. We’ve never—”*

*But I stopped.*

*Because I remembered.*

*Not clearly — but like waking from a fever dream. This trail. That clearing. Lo’s voice. The sinkhole. The tapes. The voice in the woods pretending to be me. Pretending to be her. Pretending to be both of us.*

*We’d been here before.*

*And every time, we left a little more of ourselves behind.*

*Lo dropped the cassette.*

*It hissed as it hit the dirt — like a snake sighing.*

*“I brought you here,” she said. “Not because I wanted to end it.”*

*“Then why?”*

*“Because I wanted to remember.”*

*The creature inside her blinked slowly.*

*“You always forget. But not me. I record.”*

*Then, she whispered:*

*“Do you want to hear how this one ends?”*

# Part 9: The Dog in the Tape

*I didn’t answer her.*

*I ran.*

*Branches tore at my arms as I bolted through the trees, past the old cassette nailed to the trunk, past the circle of feathers, back to the cabin. My lungs were fire. My mind — worse. I couldn’t trust my memories anymore.*

*But I knew this:*

***The creature wasn’t hunting us. It was writing us. And we were just trying to read ahead in our own script.***

*I locked the cabin door behind me and collapsed against it. Everything was humming. The TV had turned itself on, static buzzing like bees behind a wall.*

*And on the screen — a new tape was playing.*

*I didn’t put it in.*

*But it was rolling.*

*A forest trail.*

*A boy.*

*A dog.*

*A man in a wheelchair.*

*I stared.*

*The boy wasn’t me. Wasn’t Lo.*

*But I recognized him.*

*Scruffy hair. Oversized camo jacket. The way he looked back at the camera like he didn’t want to be seen crying.*

*The man spoke — slurred, bitter.*

*“You don’t name a hunting dog, boy. That’s how you go soft.”*

*The boy said something, but it was drowned out by the wind.*

*“I told you not to cry.”*

*“You think that dog’s your friend?”*

*“I could’ve hit you, you know.”*

*The shotgun rose.*

*The screen flickered.*

***BANG.***

*The dog fell.*

*But the boy didn’t scream.*

*He stared at the camera.*

*At me.*

*And then, with a voice not quite his, not quite mine, he whispered:*

*“Does this feel familiar yet, Hunter?”*

*I stood there frozen.*

***Hunter.***

*That was the name.*

*I didn’t know how I knew that. I didn’t know who he was. Or why I was crying.*

*The screen fuzzed. The tape sputtered. Then a new voice came through the static.*

*“Yo, this is Lo again. If you're hearing this… it worked. You’re almost back.”*

*The creature… the forest… it had been talking to them the whole time.*

*Not us.*

*Not Isabel and Harlow.*

*But Isaiah and Hunter.*

*ares them to read it aloud on their show.*

# Part 10: Playback Complete

*The screen cut to black.*

*Silence.*

*No static. No voice.*

*Just the sound of wind returning to the trees outside, like the forest had been holding its breath for the end.*

*I turned around.*

*Lo was standing in the doorway. Or something shaped like her.*

*But she didn’t speak this time.*

*She just held out a mirror.*

*Old. Cracked. Filmy with age. And in it, I didn’t see myself.*

*I saw* ***two people*** *sitting in a sound booth. Headphones on. Mics warm. Recording.*

*Laughing. Telling stories. Stories like this one.*

*I saw one of them blink.*

*Then lean in to the mic and whisper, “Wait a minute…”*

*I saw the other freeze.*

*Mouth open. Eyes wide.*

*Realizing.*

*Too late.*

*The story they’d been reading aloud?*

*It wasn’t fiction.*

*It was a* ***recording***\*.\*

*Of their lives.*

*Of everything they were afraid of. Everything they never said aloud. Everything they laughed off in front of an audience to avoid thinking about how deep it really went.*

*And then…*

*The mirror cracked.*

*Lo—if it was still Lo—spoke one last time.*

*But it wasn’t her voice.*

*It was* ***mine.***

1m4he5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1m4he5r/is_this_weird/,Is this weird?,"Today I learned something devastating about a very close family member, but not the one I expected. 

First things first, I am from a different country and I DO NOT DREAM. In my culture, this is very weird.

However, every once in a while I have this dream:
I am a very young boy( 4 or maybe 5) and i wake up as a child in my village during our yearly festival. Now, here is the weird part the festival(panygiri) in my language falls on August 14/15th and it's at night. I go to the village square but I see weird people. People who are familiar but I do not know them. Now, here comes the scary part, in the back of the coffee shop there is always a man with curly hair with a loose cigarette. He didn't look like anyone however, 7 years ago I found out it was my dad's long dead brother, how? I rolled a cigarette, in front of my father and he said "" you roll?"" and I told him ""you don't?"" On my life he said "" Lampis( my dead uncle) said he would show me when he'd get back, but he forgot hahaha."" This uncle died in 1963, I never saw a picture of him, the only picture of him that exists is at my aunts house and one day about 3 years ago I saw him for the first time awake.
I know this is already too much, but it is the 30th night in a row im having this dream.

Now back to the dream,
The dream always ends like this, I am always looking around for someone or something, and  as im running around a beautiful lady with black hair people called Maria( i like to think thats my grandma young) tells me "" My eyes, you are too early for the panagyri, we are setting up, and we need more chairs can you go and bring us some?"" and then she pinches or kisses my cheeck, and sends me to go grab chairs at the back and when I get there there is only 1. When I tell the lady ""there is only one"" she says that's ""all we need."" Smiles and I wake up. 

Everytime I see this dream within 1 year a close family member dies. This year I thought id be an older family member so I sent them on their dream trip with some other family members, but I found out another family member, much younger and closer to me is having heart surgery.

My cousin had 6 surgeries( cancer) died. She was 43
Aunt, surgery, died. 68
Cousin surgery, died.22
My cousins favorite grandma .90( and lowkey mine too) died

Can someone explain what's going on?

1m4hdk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1m4hdk0/is_it_emotional_abuse_or_am_i_over_exaggerating/,Is it Emotional Abuse or am I Over Exaggerating?,"Hi everyone. I’m asking this question because I am unsure if my sister has been emotionally abusing me or if she has just been rude. I will first talk about her general characteristics towards me and others along with my relationship with her and finish off with specific examples that I believe show a pattern.

I am 18 years old and my sister is 22. Growing up, she had been nothing but kind, helping me with things like walking and fashion while putting up with my shenanigans as the younger child. She would even introduce me to her friends and allow me to spend time, never feeling embarrassed. We never really fought and even if we did, it would quickly be resolved. I thought I was the luckiest sibling alive as I didn’t fight her much and we got along well.

Starting in the summer of 2021, when I was about to start high school and she was about to start college, things started to change. She started to suddenly care much more about how I behaved, how I looked, and what I did. When things didn’t go her way, she would get mad quickly and make me feel bad for what I did. Initially, the incidents were isolated, so I didn’t think much about it. However, during my winter break in 2024, things took a turn for the worse.

Since that winter break and every time she has been in the house or we have been alone together, she has made my life hell. She’ll become impatient very quickly if I ask basic questions, resort to insults very quickly if things don’t go her way, get mad at me for things she has absolutely no involvement in, try to make points about everything if I made a mistake or didn’t do something, makes me feel bad if I don’t do something for her, and is such a hypocrite about it all. These are just some of the things and I will go in detail about incidents later.

Before I go into details, my sister has helped me a lot throughout these years. She helped me with college essays, LinkedIn page, and gave me advice about things to do during high school. However, I believe just because she did these things, which I appreciate her for, that does not mean that she can then do what she has been doing otherwise.

In the summer of 2021, things changed with my sister. When it was revealed that I would be doing cross country in high school, which I needed to do in order to satisfy the sports requirement, she instantly freaked out and said how I would be slow, terrible, and how people would judge and talk badly about me. She then went on about how I’ll never have friends and how I’m so awkward, things her friends apparently said about me. She never gave encouragement. Just to be clear, none of this ever materialized as I became captain of the cross country team and I graduated with an amazing group of friends who I feel safe, comfortable, and happy with.

This pattern continued, with her once ranting about my body and health choices after eating just 2 chocolate chip pieces. She criticized, from time to time, my posture, looks, friends, and actions.

Overall, I thought these were isolated incidents, as they didn’t happen often. However, in December of 2024, it got worse. We had an argument over college essays, specifically one where I wrote about my struggles with mental health. She said it was overused and I needed to rewrite it, but instead of leaving it at that, she then proceeded to say that I have no emotional intelligence. This was a key turning point, as every time we’ve been in proximity to each other, something or the other has gone wrong. 

For the rest of that break, she said I was dirty, lied about promises I made regarding exercising, said I didn’t look good, tried to control my eating habits, said I wasn’t mentally satisfied, and that I wouldn’t be able to work do to how I look and act.

After that, she went back to college and things largely settled again. She did ask my mom if I was jealous about my cousin getting into Cornell, a question which made no sense to me. And she got mad about how her “reputation” was going to be in ruins because I didn’t immediately reach out to a friend of hers regarding a college I got into. Throughout this summer, it got much worse.

In June, my family traveled to Thailand, India and Dubai, with just my sister and I going to the latter destination to see my cousin. Quickly, the problems began. She resorted to insults when things didn’t go properly, such a calling me a dumbass because I couldn’t find a water bottle, saying I suck because I couldn’t take a photo to her liking in Expo City Dubai, and saying I’m useless because I didn’t go in the right direction when finding a coffee shop in Dubai. She would get mad quickly, her voice changing to yelling or anger if I made one mistake. If I didn’t do something she wanted, she would make me feel bad for not doing it and get mad at me. If I asked questions about things like directions so that I can help her, she would yell and get impatient, acting as if I was being useless. She made points about things I did wrong or differently too often, repeating it every time she had the chance and shoving it in my face. Due to these actions, I felt like I was walking on eggshells, afraid of making one tiny mistake that she would get really mad about and never let me forget out. 

One of the things my brain does it process what is happening slowly, slower than most people. If a topic changes really fast, I might not process that immediately and have to ask a clarifying question. This happened, unfortunately, fairly often during the trip. When I was at my cousins’ house, I had to sometimes ask them to repeat things or clarify what they were saying. One key thing to remember is that I never got my sister involved in any of this. However, she would be the one who got mad really quickly and would show exasperation in her voice. Once, when the car was being parked and I couldn’t properly hear what the driver was saying about where to park, I asked again about what exactly was said. Everyone was kind enough to tell me. However, my sister then asks in front of everyone, “Do you even pay any attention?” She asks this in such a demeaning and condescending voice. 

After coming back from the trip, things have been largely ok. I have avoided her, so nothing typically happens. However, there have been moments. When I finally had the courage to post an Instagram story, something I avoided for a long time because of her potential judgement since she is so specific with photos, she didn’t even try to encourage or praise me. All she did was criticize and say it “looked like a story from a middle school girl.” Again, this was my VERY FIRST STORY. When she agreed to drive my dad to work and me to a doctor’s appointment, since we only have 2 cars, she started complaining about how I couldn’t drive, complained about the scheduling of the appointment, me potentially spending money of transport back since I would’ve taken an uber, and then accused me of lying about the fact I had an appointment. By the way, she agreed to drive me. Even her tone when she is trying to be nice sounds condescending and rude, as if it’s forced.

A lot of my sister’s actions are incredibly hypocritical. She hates it when people comment negatively or make her feel bad about her body and looks, yet she gladly does it to me. She hates it when people ask her to do something for them, but she shames me into doing things for her. She hated the fact that I was going to spend at most $30, yet she spends thousands on restaurants and trips. Finally, she hates it when people get mad quickly, yet she gets mad quickly over small mistakes.

The worst part is what my parents’ response is to all of it. My mom knows about these toxic traits as my sister will speak with a rude tone to my mom. However, my mom stays on the sidelines and even enables it, especially when my sister started fat-shaming me (I do have a bigger body figure and suffer from gynecomastia). My dad, who has similar traits but does use them on me, does not really see it.

So I’ll end with this. Is this emotional abuse or is my sister just being rude? And regardless of whether or not it is, what should I do about this situation? I greatly appreciate any thoughts and advice.

P.s. I can go into much greater detail if you guys want, but I have decided to start with this for now.",1,1752990723.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False
1m4hdjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m4hdjq/dialing_close_to_zero_eureka_mignon_classico/,Dialing close to zero [Eureka Mignon Classico],"I recently upgraded my setup:

* Eureka Mignon Classico
* Gaggia Classic (pre 2015)
* IMS basket

I first tried dialing in the coffee I had on hands. Lavazza Oro, which is a darker roast and I got good results in terms of taste pulling a 1:2 1:2.5 ratio in 30 sec. However, the balance was ok in terms of sourness, acidity. The coffee was strong. Like the body was very full with an absence of clarity (or at least what I could call clarity). I probably should have gone for a coarser grind but it would have run fast.

Now I got a medium roast from the store (Rwanda, Arabica, brand is Monoprix, France). I have an horrible time dialing in.

Basically I have to grind very fine. Much more than the Lavazza. I’m at +1/3 unit on the dial (the dial is 5 units) from the zero point (the point at which the empty grinder starts to chime). And I’m pulling 16g on, like 65g out in 20”. Taste is ok, but it runs FAST.

**Is it normal on the Eureka to dial so close to zero point ? Should I go for a bigger dose (20g ?)**

I read there and there that people typically have their Eureka grinder a couple of whole units from zero on the dial. Whereas I’m a few degrees away…",1,1752990723.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1m4hdjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1m4hdjg/once_promised_forever_summary_review_and_reading/,"Once Promised Forever: Summary, Review and Reading Link","One of Celeste Adams’s students hadn’t turned in a single assignment all semester. So she docked her participation grade.



That afternoon, her desk was trashed by a group of people.



Her lesson plans were scattered across the floor, the computer screen was smashed, and the water from her travel mug spilled across the desk, soaking through stacks of student essays she’d stayed up grading.



Celeste stood frozen in the chaos, her fingertips trembling slightly.



She took a deep breath, and turned to talk to Vanessa Clarke—but just as she rounded the corner of the classroom building, she saw Lucian Sullivan.



Her husband. He was gently holding Vanessa in his arms, wiping the tears from her eyes with the pad of his thumb, his voice impossibly tender. “Don’t cry. I’ve already settled the socre for you. As long as I’m around, no one’s going to lay a finger on you.”



Vanessa sobbed as she looked up at him, her eyes red-rimmed. “Thank you, Mr. Sullivan… If it weren’t for you, I’d be eaten alive at school. I don’t even know how to repay you.”



Lucian chuckled softly, his thumb caressing her lower lip. “Then repay me with a kiss. Deal?”



Vanessa gave a bashful smile, hesitated for a beat, then rose onto her toes and placed a soft kiss on the corner of his mouth.



“This is just a thank-you… It doesn’t mean I’m saying yes to you.” She whispered. “You’re married. If you're really gonna chase me...I do enjoy a good long test drive.”



Lucian ruffled her hair affectionately. “Okay. I’ll wait.”



Hidden in the shadows, Celeste felt her blood run cold.



...



She suddenly thought of their wedding day. Lucian had knelt in a sea of rose petals, his eyes brimming with tenderness As he said, “Celeste, I’ll only ever love you. For the rest of my life.”



And now? It had only been three years. So that was the end of “forever”?



Once Vanessa was gone—back to her dorm—Celeste finally walked up to Lucian’s car, her face pale.



Lucian was leaning against the car, lighting a cigarette. His long fingers held it between his lips, the flame casting sharp shadows over his chiseled profile.



When he saw her, he clearly froze. “Celeste?”



“Lucian Sullivan.” Her voice shook. “You and her… how long has this been going on?”



Lucian paused for a moment, then let out a low laugh. With deliberate grace, he blew a smoke ring into the air, the haze curling around his smoldering bedroom eyes—eyes designed to break hearts.



“Well, since you’ve found out, I won’t bother hiding it.” His voice dripped with lazy nonchalance. “You only get ten good years to mess around in life. Once you're old and past your prime—the party's over.""



“I do love you, Celeste. But don’t expect me to love only you. That gets boring.”



“Vanessa has that same untouch innocence you once had. I’m intrigued. Don’t worry, I’m not planning to divorce you. When I’m done having fun, I’ll come back to you.”



Celeste felt her heart twist, like someone had gripped it in their fist and was mercilessly squeezing. “I can’t accept this. If you cut things off with her now, I can still forgive you.”



A frown snapped onto Lucian’s face, his voice turning icy. “Stop overreacting. I’ve made myself clear. I’ll spend most of the rest of my life with you—as long as you…”



He grabbed her chin, eyes glinting like steel. “Behave. And stop bothering my girl.”



With that, he let go and walked away.



Celeste stood there trembling from head to toe.



She’d heard all about the upper-class hypocrisy—men playing devoted husbands at home while collecting mistresses like trophies. And Lucian, as a top-tier heir, was a magnet for socialites and debutantes alike.



But she’d never thought Lucian would become one of them.



Because he had once loved her so deeply.



So deeply he’d insisted on marrying her—a nobody teacher’s daughter—even against the Sullivan family’s objections. So deeply he’d stood outside her dorm for three days and nights just to win her back. So deeply he remembered she needed three sugars in her coffee, remembered the 15th of each month brought her period cramps, remembered how much she hated rainy days…



On their wedding day, he had held her hand and sworn before everyone: he would love only her, for the rest of his life.



Turns out, “the rest of his life” ended way sooner than she expected.



Celeste didn’t even remember how she got home.



She collapsed into bed in a daze, tears soaking through her pillow.



When she woke again, the bone-chilling water had already crept up to her chest.



Her eyes flew open—she was suspended inside a massive glass tank, wrists shackled above her head, and the water level was steadily rising.



Across from her, Lucian sat on a leather sofa in a pristine suit, his long legs crossed, idly playing with a lighter.



The firelight danced on his handsome profile—but none of it warmed the ice in his eyes.



“Lucian…!” she struggled, water splashing everywhere. “What are you doing?!”



“You went to Vanessa,” he said coldly. “Told her to stay away from me.”



The lighter snapped shut. He stood and walked slowly to the edge of the tank. “So she deleted all my contacts.”



“This is your punishment. Remember this lesson.”



“I didn’t!” Celeste shook her head frantically, her voice trembling on the edge of a breakdown. “I never even saw her after I went home!”



“Still lying?” Lucian sneered. He motioned to the guards. “Increase the water.”



The level surged upward, cold water like a thousand ghostly hands wrapping around her throat.



Celeste was forced to tilt her head back, the water now brushing her chin. Every breath felt like a countdown to drowning.



Lucian looked on, unmoved by her pain, his gaze like winter frost. “I told you—I love you. Just give me ten years, and I’ll come back.”



“But first, stop going after Vanessa.”



And with that, he turned and left.



“Lucian! Lucian—!”



Her cries were swallowed by water. Lucian never looked back.



The water kept rising, every ten minutes, inch by inch. The suffocating cold stayed with her like a curse.



On the edge of death, she started seeing flashes—



That school trip years ago, when she’d fallen into a lake and he had dived in like a madman to save her.



The countless nights she was afraid of the dark, and he stayed up talking to her until sunrise.



The time he ran across the city to bring her a bowl of hot chicken soup when her stomach ached…



But now, it had all gone up in smoke.



By the time the guards pulled her out, Celeste couldn’t even stand.



She collapsed to the floor, coughing violently, drenched through and utterly wretched.



Her hands trembled as she pulled out her phone. The screen lit up—



Vanessa had updated her social feed.



“First time someone waited all night under my dorm just to get unblocked\~”



The photo showed Lucian holding a bouquet of roses under the dorm building, his eyes gentle and soft.



Celeste stared at the picture. Then, suddenly, she laughed—while tears fell onto the screen.



She stood up, wobbling, and the first thing she did after getting home was draft a divorce agreement.



Lucian didn’t return until that night.



Seeing her pale face, he softened his tone for once. “Let’s grab dinner. I’ll make it up to you, okay?”



He ruffled her hair like he was soothing a pet having a tantrum. “It’s over now. I’m just gonna be with her for ten years. Don’t go looking for trouble again.”



Celeste looked up, calm. “Fine. But you need to sign something.”



She handed him a document. “A contract promising you’ll come back to the family after ten years.”



Lucian didn’t even glance at it before signing.



“Happy now?” He smirked and leaned in to kiss her.



Celeste turned her head away, saying softly. “Yeah. I’m happy.”



She was happy.



Because he hadn’t realized—what he signed wasn’t a promise to return.



It was a divorce agreement...

# Chapter 2

Just as Lucian Sullivan finished signing his name, his phone rang.



His assistant, Connor’s voice came through the phone speaker. “Mr. Sullivan, Ms. Clarke twisted her ankle. She’s in a lot of pain and can’t walk…”



Lucian’s expression shifted slightly. “I’ll be right there.”



He put the phone away and looked at Celeste. “Vanessa got hurt. I need to go check on her. Rain check on dinner.”



“Don’t bother.” Celeste clenched the divorce papers in her hand. “I don’t need you to keep me company anymore.”



Lucian frowned like he wanted to say something, but in the end, he turned and left.



Celeste headed straight to a law office. The attorney flipped through the document carefully, then nodded. “It’s valid. The divorce will be finalized after the mandatory 30-day waiting period..”



“Thank you.”



Leaving the firm, Celeste went back to Ashbourne University. In the Dean’s office, she handed in her resignation letter.



“Celeste?” Dean Walker looked up in surprise. “You’re one of our best instructors. Why are you suddenly quitting?”



“I’m getting divorced,” Celeste replied calmly. “I want to leave this city.”



Dean Walker sighed. “Alright… finish the last few classes this semester, then you can go.”



“Thank you.”



Celeste stepped out of the office and took a deep breath.



For her final class, she pulled herself together and walked into the lecture hall—only to spot Lucian and Vanessa sitting in the back corner.



Lucian, dressed in a crisp suit, lounged in the last row. Vanessa leaned against his shoulder. The two of them whispered and giggled, fingers entwined.



Celeste felt a sharp pain in her chest.



Lucian used to be a complete workaholic—he had cut their honeymoon short after just three days to rush back to the office. And now, he was skipping billion-dollar deals just to sit in on a random elective class with Vanessa?



She took another breath, walked to the front of the class, and began. “Today we’re reading Shakespeare’s Sonnets…”



Throughout the entire lecture, laughter kept floating from the back row.



Lucian’s low chuckles. Vanessa’s coquettish replies. Each sound stabbed Celeste like a knife.



The second the class ended, she practically bolted out of the classroom.



In the restroom, she splashed cold water on her face. She was just about to leave when she heard Vanessa’s voice coming from one of the stalls.



“Lucian gave up a billion-dollar contract just to chase after me—and even sat through class with me!” she bragged on the phone. “You should’ve seen the way he was looking at me—like he wanted to devour me.”



A girl on the other end asked, “If he likes you that much, why haven’t you said yes yet?”



“Are you dumb?” Vanessa scoffed. “Guys like him? They’re surrounded by women. The only way to keep them hooked is to string them along—hot and cold.”



She lowered her voice. “I’m not looking to be some kept woman. I want to be Mrs. Sullivan.”



Celeste stood rooted in place, nails digging into her palm.



Expressionless, she walked out of the restroom and passed right by Vanessa.



“Professor Adams!” Vanessa scrambled to hang up and rushed after her, grabbing her arm. “What did you hear?”



“Nothing.” Celeste jerked her hand away. “Whatever it is, it’s none of my business.”



Vanessa still wanted to follow up, but out of the corner of her eye, she spotted Lucian approaching.



Her eyes flickered, and without warning, she grabbed Celeste’s wrist and slapped herself—hard.



Smack!



The sharp crack of a slap echoed harshly down the hallway.



“Professor…” Vanessa covered her face, tears welling up in her eyes, her voice trembling with grievance. “I swear I’ll stay far away from Mr. Sullivan from now on… Please don’t be mad at me…”



Lucian stormed over, his face thunderous. “Celeste! You signed the damn agreement! Why are you still bullying Vanessa?!”



“I didn’t.” Celeste looked at him calmly. “She slapped herself.”



“Mr. Sullivan…” Vanessa whimpered, shrinking into his arms. “Maybe… maybe you should stop pursuing me. Professor Adams is so angry. I’m scared…”



Lucian immediately pulled her into his arms. “Don’t be. She doesn’t get to decide what I do.”



Vanessa’s eyes were red and watery as she whispered, “But she’s still your wife. She forced me to stay away from you… and she slapped me…”



Her voice broke, “I’ve never been treated like this before…”



Lucian’s eyes darkened. He gently touched her cheek where it had turned red, his voice soft.

“Don’t be upset. I'll let you get back at her tenfold, okay?”

# Chapter 3

Vanessa feigned panic. “I… I really shouldn’t. She’s your wife. And she’s my professor… How could I ever hit my teacher?”



“Then let the bodyguards do it.” Lucian’s voice remained gentle—while saying the cruelest words. “That way you won’t have to get your hands dirty.”



Celeste’s pupils contracted, staring in disbelief at the man who once shielded her from the world. “Lucian… do you even hear yourself right now?”



Lucian didn’t even spare her a glance. He raised his hand and gave the order. “Do it.”



Two towering bodyguards stepped forward and slammed her against the wall, pinning her in place.



Smack!



The first slap exploded against her cheek. A sharp ringing filled Celeste’s ears.



In a daze, she saw a memory from years ago—a stormy night when Lucian had once stood in front of her like a shield, growling, “Touch her and I’ll make you wish you were dead.”



Smack!



The second slap shattered the memory. Blood oozed from the corner of her mouth, staining her pale lips red.



Through the haze, she saw Lucian gently covering Vanessa’s eyes, whispering softly in her ear.

Vanessa let out a playful little squeal and lightly punched his chest.



…



By the tenth slap, Celeste could no longer feel the pain. Her body gave out, collapsing to the ground as stifled gasps of horror rippled through the students nearby.



Through blurry vision, she saw Lucian say gently to Vanessa, “Come on, let’s go get sushi at that place you love.”



Students in the hallway whispered behind cupped hands, “God… poor Professor Adams…”



“How could Mr. Sullivan do that to her?”



“That girl is disgusting. She slapped herself!”



Celeste propped herself up against the wall and slowly stood.



Her face throbbed, each step like a blade slicing into her skin.



But what was this pain compared to the gaping wound in her heart—raw, bleeding, torn open like someone had clawed through it.



She had thought… even if Lucian no longer loved her, he’d at least show some shred of compassion for the past they shared.



But he actually had her slapped ten times in front of the crowd, all for Vanessa.



As she stepped out the school gates, the autumn wind stung her bruised face. She gasped in pain.



Back at home, she stood before the mirror and stared at her wretched reflection. Her face was swollen, lips split, blood still dried at the edges.



And suddenly—she laughed.



Laughed until fat tears spilled down her cheeks.



It took her three days to heal the wounds on her face before she could go back to school like nothing had happened.



As soon as she stepped into her office, her phone rang. Dean Walker’s voice came through.

“Celeste, Vanessa Clarke skipped several midterm exams. As her academic advisor, you need to follow up with her.”



Celeste opened Vanessa’s social feed.



The latest post showed her at an auction, a priceless diamond necklace draped around her neck, with the caption: Mr. Sullivan said this necklace suits me perfectly\~



Scrolling further, it was all pictures of her and Lucian out at lavish venues: private yachts, Michelin-starred restaurants, equestrian clubs…



Celeste dialed Vanessa’s number.



The background music was loud. Vanessa’s cheerful voice answered, “Hello? Professor?”



“You missed your midterm exams,” Celeste said matter-of-factly. “Dean Walker asked me to check in with you..”



“Oh, that,” Vanessa giggled. “It’s just a few exams. You’re close with the Dean—can’t you just enter some grades for me?”



She paused, then added smugly, “If that’s too much trouble, I’ll have Mr. Sullivan donate a few buildings. Problem solved, right?”



Lucian’s low laughter echoed from the background. “Having fun?”



“Mm-hmm\~” Vanessa cooed back. Then she added to Celeste, “Professor, if it’s nothing urgent, don’t call again. We’re busy enjoying ourselves.”



Click. The call ended.



Celeste gave a bitter laugh and set her phone down. She didn’t bother following up.



That evening, as she headed home, she spotted Lucian in the front yard of the mansion, personally teaching Vanessa how to drive.



“Relax your grip on the wheel. Don’t be nervous.” He stood beside the driver's seat, leaning down close to Vanessa, his voice impossibly soft. “Don’t be afraid. I’m right here.”



The scene pierced through Celeste like a blade.



Once, he had taught her to drive exactly like this.



When she fumbled and nearly hit a guardrail, he had only laughed and pinched her cheek. “What’s there to be afraid of? I’m right here.”



Now he was saying the exact same words to another girl.



“Try it on your own,” Lucian said, stepping back.



Vanessa bit her lip. “I—I’m scared I’ll hit someone…”



“It’s okay,” Lucian said, gently ruffling her hair. “I’m here.”



Reassured, Vanessa pressed the accelerator.



And then—she suddenly swerved straight at Celeste.



BAM!



Celeste was thrown into the air and slammed to the ground.



Blood spread beneath her, soaking the pavement.



Through the pain, she saw Lucian rushing toward her.



But the first thing he did was pull the panicked Vanessa into his arms. “Are you okay? Did it scare you?”



Celeste lay in a pool of blood, her vision darkening.



…



When she woke again, she was in a hospital bed.



“You’re awake?” Lucian stood at her bedside, face calm. “The doctor said you’ve fractured a few ribs. Don’t go back to work. Just rest.”



Celeste opened her mouth, but the pain in her chest silenced her. She could only glare at him with bloodshot eyes.



“Vanessa didn’t mean to hit you,” Lucian continued. “She just started learning. She panicked.”



“She… did it... on purpose…” Through the pain, Celeste forced each word between through gritted teeth. “I was nowhere near her…”



Lucian’s brows knit together, his tone turning impatient. “Celeste, what exactly do you want?”

# Chapter 4

“Call the police…” Celeste forced out the words. “Let the law… handle it…”



Lucian suddenly let out a low, mocking laugh. He leaned down, bracing both hands on either side of her hospital bed. His handsome face hovered inches from hers—striking and cold enough to chill her to the bone. “Have you forgotten who I am? I run Sullivan Holdings. You really think the police will take your case?”



He straightened and casually adjusted his cufflinks. “As long as I’m around, you could dial the mayor’s office and it still wouldn’t make a difference.”



“Stop making a scene. I already told you—Vanessa’s just a fling. I’ll grow tired of her soon. So stop picking on her.”



With that, he turned and left.



As the door clicked shut behind him, tears finally broke free.



She bit her lip hard to stop herself from sobbing, but the trembling of her shoulders gave her away.



Lucian didn’t show up again for days.



Then suddenly, on the day of her discharge, he appeared.



“Get in,” he ordered, standing in the doorway of her hospital room. There was no room for refusal in his tone.



Celeste silently got into the car, only to realize they weren’t headed home.



“Where are we going?” she asked.



“The yacht,” Lucian replied, one hand on the wheel, the other loosening his tie. “It’s Vanessa’s birthday party. You’re going to apologize.”



Celeste whipped her head around. “Me? Apologize to her?!”



“She’s been acting cold toward me lately,” Lucian said, glancing at her with a slight frown. “Clearly still feeling guilty about hitting you.”



“Lucian Sullivan!” Celeste’s voice trembled. “I was the one who got hit! I’m the one with broken ribs!”



Screeech—



The sharp sound of brakes pierced the silence.



Lucian stomped on the brake pedal and turned to look at Celeste.



Outside, neon lights shimmered across his chiseled features, casting his face in harsh shadows.



“Celeste,” he said, voice low and threatening, “your grandma’s still in the hospital, isn’t she?”



“If you don’t want her finding out about us, then behave.”



Celeste stared at him, utterly stunned.



He was threatening her… with her grandmother?



Had he forgotten? Three years ago, he’d knelt before that same elderly woman, eyes red with emotion, begging for her granddaughter’s hand.



He’d said it so sincerely then—



“Grandma, I swear I’ll protect Celeste with my life. I won’t let her suffer, not even a little—not in this lifetime.”



And now?



Celeste bit down hard on her lip, only releasing when she tasted blood.



She turned away, staring out the window as the city lights blurred past. “…Fine,” she whispered.



…



The cruise ship blazed with lights, Champagne towers sparkled beneath the crystal chandeliers.



Vanessa stood at the center, surrounded by a crowd of girlfriends. Dressed in a white gown, her skin glowed like porcelain. Her smile was radiant and charming.



“Mr. Sullivan really spoils you,” one girl in a pink dress gushed. “This birthday party is insane!”



“I know, right?” another chimed in. “We’re only here because of you!”



Vanessa lowered her head bashfully, fingers lightly tracing the diamond necklace around her neck—an absolute fortune. “Don’t say that… Mr. Sullivan’s already married, and his wife is our professor.”



“So what?” one girl snorted. “He’s clearly only into you now.”



“Exactly,” another girl laughed. “That marriage has been dead in name only for ages!”



Lucian walked over then, his tall figure casting a long shadow under the chandelier.



He seemed unbothered by their whispers. His gaze landed on Celeste. “Apologize,” he said calmly.



Under everyone’s stare, Celeste stepped forward to Vanessa. Her heels echoed on the deck with each step, dull and heavy—each one like a blow to her own heart.



“Professor Adams?” Vanessa blinked, red lips parting in surprise. “What are you doing here?”



Celeste dug her nails into her palm, eyes rimmed red. “…I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have gotten in your way when you hit me and made you feel guilty these past few days.”

# Chapter 5

The guests around them whispered quietly, eyes darting between Celeste and Vanessa.



“Oh my god… is this real? She’s the one who got hit, and she’s the one apologizing?”



“Mr. Sullivan really dotes on Miss Clarke, huh?”



“Come on, that marriage’s been dead for a while—everyone knows it.”



Celeste stood in the middle of the crowd, her nails digging deep into her palm—but she felt no pain.



Vanessa tilted her chin smugly. “I accept your apology.”



She affected a gracious air as she linked arms with Celeste—like she was doing her a favor. “Since you’re already here, Professor, why don’t you join the fun?”



Before Celeste could decline, one of Vanessa’s friends giggled and held up a box. “Let’s play a game! Everyone draws a number, and whoever gets 6 has to take a punishment!”



First round. Celeste unfolded her paper expressionlessly—

Number six.



“Whoa! It’s Professor Adams!” the pink-dress girl gasped theatrically. “The punishment is… eat three tubes of wasabi!”



Without a word, Celeste took them and swallowed, bite after bite.



The sharp burn shot straight up her nose, tears streaming uncontrollably down her cheeks. Her stomach twisted like it was on fire.



Laughter erupted all around her.



“Dang, she’s tough!”



“Let’s go again!”



Second round. Once again—she drew six.



“This time…” The girl smiled wickedly. “Bark like a dog. Three times!”



Celeste went pale.



“That’s too much.” Her voice trembled. “Pick something else.”



“A bet’s a bet, Professor,” Vanessa blinked. “Rules are rules.”



Lucian strolled over and gently wrapped an arm around Vanessa’s shoulders. “Don’t ruin the mood, Celeste. It’s just a game. Don’t spoil Vanessa’s birthday.”



Celeste stared at his perfectly composed face, now so close—and her heart felt like it was being torn apart.



“Woof…”



The first bark barely squeezed through her clenched teeth.



“Woof… woof…”



Each bark cut into her like a blade, stripping away her dignity bit by bit.



Whispers and stifled giggles echoed around her.



Celeste bit down on her lip so hard she tasted blood.



Third round. Of course—it was her again.



“This time, you have to finish all the liquor on the table\~”



An entire row of shots lined up before her. Her stomach was already burning.



“I can’t,” Celeste rasped.



“Oh, come on, Professor,” someone whined. “You played before—don’t bail and ruin the fun now!”



Lucian sat beside Vanessa, peeling grapes for her with delicate fingers. At the commotion, he finally looked up. “Celeste, don’t be difficult.”



So she picked up a glass. Then another. And another.



Each shot seared her throat like fire, her insides twisting in agony.



By the eighth glass, she couldn’t take anymore. Blood burst from her mouth.



“Ugh—”



It splattered across the pristine white tablecloth, a shocking splash of red.



“I… I need to leave…” Celeste stumbled to her feet, vision spinning.



“Oh, come on,” Vanessa frowned. “We’re just getting started.”



Celeste yanked her arm away and staggered off the deck.



The sea breeze outside was sharp and biting. She gripped the railing, gasping for air.



The pain in her stomach doubled her over, and she vomited more blood onto the floor.



Her vision darkened. In the next second, her shoulder slammed against the railing—

And she toppled over.



Splash!



Icy seawater swallowed her whole.



Celeste didn’t know how to swim. Saltwater rushed into her nose and mouth. The suffocating panic was immediate, total.



She thrashed wildly in the water, catching a glimpse of shadows moving on deck.



“Help… me…”



She saw Lucian sprinting toward the railing, poised to dive in. Then someone screamed, “Mr. Sullivan! Vanessa ate something bad and passed out from an allergic reaction!”



Lucian froze.



A heartbeat later, he turned away.



The last thing Celeste saw was him running off, carrying Vanessa in his arms.

Weekends seem to fly by faster than a Red Bull on a straightaway, don't they? How about we put the brakes on the usual routine, step out of our comfort zones (and maybe our race-day pajamas), and do something exhilaratingly different?

The Starting Grid: Our Day's Itinerary

Let's kick things off with a visit to a quirky café or perhaps an arcade – where we can fuel up or unleash our competitive spirits like undercover racers. From there, we'll navigate the Bangalore traffic (our very own street circuit!) and head to a screening of an F1 movie. We can dissect the racing lines, critique the CGI, and secretly rate the authenticity of the engine sounds like seasoned commentators.

Victory Lap: Beyond the Credits 
If the conversation’s still flowing after the credits roll, who knows—maybe we can find a spot for some late-night ice cream, a debrief over coffee, or even a spontaneous detour to discuss our favorite moments, rounding off the day just right.

The Driver's Profile: About Me
I'm 26, a tech guy, a semi-professional overthinker, and a full-time curious soul. I'm into swimming, spontaneous treks, and exploring cafés that look like they were built for rainy days and long chats. On weekends, I alternate between doing absolutely nothing and everything at once – much like a qualifying lap!

P.S. Whoever's late buys the popcorn. No debates.

  Though the streetlights of Strattenburg were still on, and there was no hint of sunlight in the east, the parking lot in front of the middle school was buzzing with energy as almost 175 eighth graders arrived in family cars and vans, all driven by sleepy parents eager to get rid of the kids for a few days. The kids had slept little. They had packed all night, tossed and turned in their beds, hopped out long before sunrise, showered, packed some more, awakened their parents, pushed for a quick breakfast, and in general acted as hyper as a bunch of five-year-olds waiting for Santa. At six a.m., as instructed, they all arrived at the school at the same time. They were greeted by the awesome sight of four long, sleek, matching tour buses in perfect single file with running lights glittering in the dark and diesel engines purring.  
  
  The Eighth-Grade Field Trip! Six hours by bus to Washington, DC, for three-and-a-half days of seeing the sights and four nights of mischief in a high-rise hotel. For this, the students had worked for months—selling doughnuts on Saturday mornings, washing a thousand cars, cleaning roadside ditches and recycling the aluminum cans, soliciting the same downtown merchants who contributed every year, selling fruitcakes door-to-door at Christmas, auctioning used sports equipment, holding bake-a-thons and bike-a-thons and book-a-thons, and pursuing with enthusiasm any number of mildly profitable ventures approved by the Field Trip Committee. All proceeds went into the same pot. The goal had been ten thousand dollars, certainly not enough to cover all expenses but enough to guarantee the trip. This year the class had raised almost twelve thousand dollars, which meant that each student was assessed $125.  
  
  There were a few students who could not afford this. However, the school had a long tradition of making sure no one was left behind. Every single eighth grader was headed to Washington, along with ten teachers and eight parents.  
  
  Theodore Boone was thrilled that his mother had not volunteered for the trip. They had discussed it over dinner. His father had quickly bowed out, claiming, as usual, that he simply had too much work. Theo’s mother, at first, seemed interested in tagging along, but soon realized she could not. Theo checked her trial calendar at the office and knew full well she would be in court while he was having a ball in Washington.  
  
  As they waited in traffic, Theo sat in the front seat and stroked the head of his dog, Judge, who was sitting partially on the console and partially in Theo’s lap. Judge usually sat wherever he wanted, and none of the Boones told him otherwise.  
  
  “Are you excited?” Mr. Boone asked. He had drop-off duty because Mrs. Boone had gone back to bed for another hour of sleep.  
  
  “Sure,” Theo said, trying to hide his excitement. “A long bus ride, though.”  
  
  “I’m sure you guys’ll be asleep before you get out of town. We’ve gone over the rules. Any questions?”  
  
  “We’ve been through this a dozen times,” Theo said, mildly frustrated. He liked his parents. They were a bit older than average, and he was an only child, and at times they seemed a little too protective. One of the few things that irritated Theo about them was their fondness of rules. All rules, regardless of who made them, must be followed perfectly.  
  
  Theo suspected this was because they were both lawyers.  
  
  “I know, I know,” his father said. “Just follow the rules, do what your teachers tell you, and don’t do anything stupid. Remember what happened two years ago?”  
  
  How could Theo, or any other eighth grader, ever forget what happened two years ago? Two bozos—Jimbo Nance and Duck DeFoe—dropped water balloons from a fifth-floor hotel room into the indoor lobby far below. No one was hurt, but some folks got really wet, and really mad. A snitch turned them in, and the boys’ parents had to drive six hours in the middle of the night to retrieve them. Then six hours back to Strattenburg. Jimbo said it was a very long drive. They were suspended from classes for a week, and the school was told to find another hotel for future field trips. This misadventure was now legendary around town, and it was used to caution and frighten Theo and every other eighth grader headed to Washington.  
  
  They finally parked. Theo said good-bye to Judge and told him to stay in the front seat. Mr. Boone opened a rear door and removed Theo’s luggage—one nylon overnight bag that was supposed to weigh under twenty pounds. Anything over twenty pounds would be left behind (one of the Big Rules!), and the guilty kid would be forced to make the trip without the benefit of clean clothes and a toothbrush. This would not have bothered Theo in the least. He had survived a week in the woods with the Boy Scouts with less equipment.  
  
  • • •  
  
  Mr. Mount was standing by a bus with some scales, weighing other luggage as it was loaded into storage. He was smiling and laughing, as excited as his students. Theo’s bag weighed nineteen pounds, eight ounces. His backpack barely made the limit at twelve pounds, and Theo was in business. Mr. Mount checked the overnight bag for an ID card and told Theo to get on the bus.  
  
  Theo shook his father’s hand, said good-bye, froze for a moment, terrified his father might try to hug him or something awful like that, then breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Boone said, “Have fun. Call your mother.” Theo scampered aboard.  
  
  Close by, the girls were saying good-bye to their mothers with all manner of embracing, blubbering, and carrying on as if they were going off to war and would probably never come home. By the boys’ buses, though, the tough guys stiffened and tried to get away quickly from their parents with as little contact as possible.  
  
  The parking lot slowly cleared as the sun rose. At precisely seven a.m., the four buses rolled away from the school. It was Thursday. The big day had finally arrived, and the kids were noisy and rowdy. His seatmate was Chase Whipple, a close friend who was often referred to as “The Mad Scientist.” To prevent them from getting lost and wandering through the dangerous streets of DC, the teachers had implemented the Buddy System. For the next four days Theo would be stuck with Chase, and Chase with Theo, and each was supposed to know what the other was doing at all times. Theo knew he got the bad end of the deal because Chase often got lost on the campus of the Strattenburg Middle School. Keeping an eye on him would take some work. They would share a room with Woody Lambert and Aaron Nyquist.  
  
  As the buses eased through the quiet streets, the boys chattered excitedly. No one had yet thrown a punch or yanked off someone else’s cap. They had been threatened about misbehaving, and Mr. Mount was watching them closely. Then someone behind Theo passed gas, and loudly. This was instantly contagious, and before they were out of Strattenburg Theo wished he could have been sitting with April Finnemore on the other bus just ahead.  
  
  Mr. Mount cracked a window. Things eventually settled down. Thirty minutes into the trip, the boys were either asleep or lost in video games.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  Theo’s room was on the eighth floor of a new hotel on Connecticut Avenue, about a half mile north of the White House. From his window, he, along with Chase, Woody, and Aaron, had a clear view of the top half of the Washington Monument rising above the city. According to their schedule, the boys would climb to the top of the monument first thing Saturday morning. But for now, they had to hurry downstairs for a quick lunch, then, they would be off to see the sights.  
  
  Each student was allowed to pick and choose from the many attractions in Washington. It would take a year of serious work to see everything, so Mr. Mount and the other teachers had put together a list from which the students could select their favorites.  
  
  April had convinced Theo that they should see Ford’s Theatre, the place where Abraham Lincoln was shot, and this seemed like an interesting idea. Theo convinced Chase, and after lunch they gathered in the hotel lobby with Mr. Babcock, a history teacher, and a group of eighteen students. Mr. Babcock expla  
ined that they would not be taking one of the buses because their group was small. Rather, they would get to experience the DC subway system, known as the Metro. He asked how many of the students had ever ridden on a subway. Theo and three others raised their hands.  
  
  They left the hotel and began walking along a busy sidewalk. For kids who lived in a small town, the sounds and energy of a big city were at first hard to absorb. So many big buildings, so many cars bumper to bumper in traffic that hardly moved, so many people bustling along the sidewalks, all anxious to get somewhere. At the Woodley Park Metro Station, they rode the escalator down, far below the streets. Mr. Babcock had plastic SmarTrip cards that would give the students limited use of the Metro system. Their train was half-empty, clean, and efficient. As it zipped along the dark tunnel, April whispered to Theo that it was her first time on a subway. Theo said he’d been on one before in New York, when his parents took him there on vacation. The New York system, though, was far different from DC’s.  
  
  When the train stopped for the third time, just minutes after they had started, it was time to get off at the Metro Center Station. They hurried up the steps and back into the sunlight. Mr. Babcock counted eighteen kids, and they began walking. Minutes later they were on 10th Street.  
  
  Mr. Babcock stopped the group and pointed across the street to a handsome redbrick building that was obviously important. He said, “That’s Ford’s Theatre, the place where President Lincoln was shot on April 14, 1865. As you know, because you all have spent so much time doing your history assignments, the Civil War had just ended; in fact, General Lee had surrendered to General Grant only five days earlier at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. The city of Washington was in a good mood, the war was finally over, and so President and Mrs. Lincoln decided to have a night out on the town. Ford’s Theatre was the grandest, most magnificent theatre in town, and the Lincolns came here often for concerts and plays. At the time, the theatre had over two thousand seats, and the play, one called Our American Cousin, was selling out every night.”  
  
  They walked half a block and stopped again. Mr. Babcock resumed with, “Now, the war may have been over, but a lot of folks didn’t think so. One was a Confederate named John Wilkes Booth. He was a well-known actor, and he was even photographed with President Lincoln during his second inauguration, a month earlier. Mr. Booth was upset because the South had surrendered, and he was desperate to do something to help its cause. So he decided to kill President Lincoln. Because he was known to the theatre personnel, he was allowed to approach the box where the Lincolns were sitting. He shot the president once in the back of the head, jumped onto the stage, broke his leg, then, escaped out the back door.”  
  
  Mr. Babcock turned and nodded at the building beside them. He said, “This is the Petersen House, which at that time was a boardinghouse. They brought President Lincoln over here, where he was attended to by his doctors throughout the night. Word spread quickly. A crowd gathered, and federal troops were used to keep people away from the house. President Lincoln died here on the morning of April 15, 1865.”  
  
  Enough of the lecture. They finally crossed the street and entered Ford’s Theatre.  
  
  • • •  
  
  After two hours, Theo had had enough of the Lincoln killing. It was certainly interesting and all that, and he appreciated the historical importance, but it was time to move on. The coolest thing was down in the museum, under the stage, where they displayed the actual gun Booth used.  
  
  It was almost four thirty when they emerged onto 10th Street and headed back to the Metro Center Station. The traffic was even heavier, the sidewalks more crowded. Their train was packed with commuters headed home and seemed to move a lot slower. Theo was standing in the middle of the car, in a crowd, with Chase and April close by, as the train rocked and clicked along the tracks. He glanced around him at the glum faces of the commuters; no one was smiling. They all looked tired. He wasn’t sure where he would live when he grew up, but he didn’t think it would be in a big city. Strattenburg seemed the perfect size. Not too big, not too small. No traffic jams. No angry horn blowing. No crowded sidewalks. He didn’t want to ride a train to and from work.  
  
  A man seated tightly between two women lowered his newspaper as he flipped a page. He was less than ten feet away from Theo.  
  
  He looked familiar, oddly familiar. Theo took a deep breath and managed to wiggle between two men bunched together with the others. A few feet closer now, and he could see the man’s face.  
  
  He’d seen it before, but where? There was something different about it, maybe the hair was darker, maybe the reading glasses were new. Suddenly, it struck Theo like a brick against the head: The face belonged to Pete Duffy.  
  
  Pete Duffy? The most wanted man in the history of Strattenburg and Stratten County. Number seven on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted. The man who’d been accused of murdering his wife, had gone to trial in Strattenburg, in front of Judge Henry Gantry, a trial that Theo and his classmates had actually watched. The man who’d barely escaped a conviction when Judge Gantry declared a mistrial. The man who’d fled town in the middle of the night and had not been heard from since.  
  
  The man lowered the newspaper again as he flipped another page. He glanced around as Theo ducked behind another commuter. They had exchanged stares just after the trial.  
  
  Duffy had a mustache now, one sprinkled with gray whiskers. His face disappeared again behind the newspaper.  
  
  Theo was paralyzed with uncertainty. He had no idea what to do. The train stopped and more commuters piled on. It stopped again at the Dupont Circle Station. The Woodley Park Station was next. Duffy showed no signs of getting off. He did not appear to have a briefcase or bag or satchel like the other commuters. Theo squirmed his way down the train, putting a few more feet between himself and his classmates. Chase was lost in another world, as usual. April could not be seen. He could hear Mr. Babcock tell the students to get ready to get off. Theo moved farther away.  
  
  At the Woodley Park Station, the train stopped and the doors flew open. More commuters rushed on as the students scrambled to get off. In the melee, no one noticed that Theo was still on the train. The doors closed and it took off again. He kept his eyes on Pete Duffy, who was ducking behind the newspaper, probably a habit now. At the Cleveland Park Station, a few more passengers got on. Theo sent a text message to Chase explaining that he had been unable to get off, and that he was okay. He’d simply catch another train back to Woodley Park. Chase called immediately but Theo kept his phone on mute. He was sure Mr. Babcock was panicked. He would return the call in just a few minutes.  
  
  Theo began toying with his cell phone, as if he might be sending texts or playing games. He had the camera on, the video, and he was scanning the car, just another goofy thirteen-year-old being rude with a phone. Pete Duffy was fifteen feet away, sitting calmly behind his newspaper. Theo waited and waited. Finally, as the train approached the Tenleytown Station, Duffy lowered the paper and folded it. He stuck it under his arm, and for about five seconds Theo nailed him with the video. He even managed to zoom closer. When Duffy looked his way, Theo giggled at his camera as if he’d scored points in a game.  
  
  At the Tenleytown Station, Duffy got off the train, and Theo followed him. Duffy walked quickly, as if he lived with the fear of being followed. After a few minutes, Theo lost him in a crowd. He called Chase, said he was waiting on the next train, and should be there in fifteen minutes.  
  
  Chapter 3  
  
  Mr. Babcock was waiting at the Woodley Park Station, and he was not happy. Theo apologized repeatedly, fibbing that he had been caught in the crush of people and simply could not get off the train in time. Theo did not like the fact that he was being forced to lie. It was wrong and he tried to tell the truth at all times. However, occasionally he found himself in the awkward position of having to fudge on the truth for a good reason. On the subway, he had made the quick decision that it was more important to try and nail Pete Duffy than to get off when and where he was supposed to. If he got off with his classmates, Duffy  
would be gone, and a great chance to nail him would have been missed. Now, if he admitted to Mr. Babcock that he had deliberately stayed on the train, then all sorts of bad stuff would happen. He could not tell the truth about Pete Duffy, not now anyway, because he had no idea what to do with the truth. He needed some time alone to think things through.  
  
  He needed to talk to Uncle Ike.  
  
  For the moment, though, he was forced to apologize to Mr. Babcock, who was a nervous type to begin with. Back at the hotel, Mr. Babcock marched Theo over to Mr. Mount and made a full report of his student’s misdeed. As soon as Mr. Babcock walked away, Theo mumbled, “That guy just needs to relax.”  
  
  Mr. Mount, who trusted Theo and knew that if any kid could survive in the big city it was Theodore Boone, agreed and said, “Don’t do it again, okay? Just pay attention to where you are.”  
  
  “Sure,” Theo said. If you only knew.  
  
  Dinner was a pizza party in a hotel ballroom. Seating was not regulated; you could sit anywhere you wanted. So, typically, the boys took one side of the room and the girls the other. Theo nibbled on some crust and sipped water from a bottle, but his mind was not on pizza. He was certain he had seen Pete Duffy. He even remembered the way the man walked as he was entering and leaving the courthouse during his trial. It was the same walk. The same height and body type. Definitely the same eyes, nose, forehead, and chin. Theo had locked himself in his hotel bathroom and watched the video on his phone a dozen times.  
  
  Theo had found Pete Duffy! He still couldn’t believe it and he was still uncertain about what to do next, but in his excitement he had almost forgotten something important. Since Duffy had fled town, the police had posted a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. In his room before dinner, Theo had gone online and verified this reward. The Strattenburg police website had several pages dedicated to the Duffy case. There were several close-up photos of his face.  
  
  • • •  
  
  Cell phones were strictly prohibited during meals—if one was seen by an adult it was to be immediately confiscated. Halfway through the pizza party, Theo informed Mr. Mount that he needed to walk down the hallway to the restroom. Once inside, Theo locked himself in a stall and called Ike.  
  
  “I thought you were in Washington,” Ike said.  
  
  “I am. Ike, I saw Pete Duffy on the Metro. I know it’s him.”  
  
  “I thought he was in Cambodia or some place.”  
  
  “Not now. He’s right here in Washington. I got him on video. I’ll e-mail it to you right now. Take a look and I’ll call you later.”  
  
  “You’re serious, aren’t you?” Ike said, his voice suddenly sharper.  
  
  “Dead serious. Later.” Theo quickly e-mailed the video to Ike, then left the restroom and hustled back to the ballroom.  
  
  After dinner, when it was dark, the entire eighth grade loaded onto the four buses and headed for the Lincoln Memorial. There, they milled about the famous statue of Lincoln sitting and staring seriously—did the guy ever smile? Theo wondered—while clutching the sides of his chair. The lights cast even more shadows on his face, and Theo found it all quite awesome. With the assistance of a park ranger, Mr. Babcock, who evidently was a big Lincoln fan, set up a large screen at the foot of the steps—fifty-eight steps to be exact—and the students gathered around for a quick lecture. They listened in perfect silence as Mr. Babcock recapped the significant events of Lincoln’s life, material they had all covered in class, which now meant much more sitting on the steps of his memorial. As he spoke, Mr. Babcock, who was a compelling teacher, flashed photos of Lincoln as he advanced through his life.  
  
  Though the students were sitting on marble steps, there was no wiggling and no whispering. They absorbed the lecture with great interest. When Theo looked away, he gazed upon the awesome sight of the Reflecting Pool just in front of them. Beyond it, a mile away, was the towering Washington Monument, also lit to perfection. And beyond that, another mile away, was the US Capitol, its dome glowing magnificently in the night. When Theo turned around, he found President Lincoln staring down at them.  
  
  Theo knew it was a moment he would never forget.  
  
  They gave Mr. Babcock a round of applause when he finished. Next up was Ms. Greenwood, a popular African American lady who taught English to the girls. She began by asking the students to look all the way down to the Washington Monument and to try to imagine the Mall packed with almost a quarter of a million people. The day was August 28, 1963, and black people from all over America had marched on Washington to demand justice and equality. They were led by a young Baptist minister from Atlanta named Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  
  
  As she spoke, she flashed images onto the screen, photos of the crowd that day, of people marching and carrying signs. She explained that Dr. King delivered one of the most famous speeches in American history, right over there on a temporary podium, under the proud gaze of the president who ended slavery. She then played a tape of the speech, black-and-white footage of Dr. King and his dream.  
  
  Theo had seen and heard the speech before, but it was far more moving at that moment. As Dr. King’s words echoed through the night, Theo looked down the Mall and tried to imagine what it was like that day, with thousands of people packed together and listening to words that would live forever.  
  
  They applauded for Ms. Greenwood, too, when she finished. Mr. Mount said there would be no more lectures. The students were allowed to hang around the Reflecting Pool for an hour or so. Theo found a seat on a park bench and texted Ike: Did you get video? What do you think?  
  
  Evidently, Ike was waiting: I’d say it’s p duffy. Let’s talk.  
  
  Okay. Later.  
  
  • • •  
  
  Later, at the hotel, as his three roommates were watching television and waiting on the ‘lights-out’ order from Mr. Mount, Theo went to the bathroom, locked the door, and took a seat on the toilet. He called Ike, who again seemed to be waiting with the phone in his hand. He asked, “Have you told anyone?”  
  
  “Of course not,” Theo said. “No one but you. What are we going to do?”  
  
  “I’ve been thinking and I have a plan. I’ll catch an early flight to DC and land at National around noon. I want to be on the subway when he gets on this afternoon and follow him as closely as I can. I need the time, the station, and the Metro line.”  
  
  Theo had already taken notes and had it memorized. “It’s the Red Line. We got on at the Metro Center Station, and I’m positive he was already on the train.”  
  
  “How many cars on the train?”  
  
  “Uh, just guessing, I would say seven or eight.”  
  
  “And which car did you get in?”  
  
  “Don’t know, but somewhere close to the middle.”  
  
  “What time was it?”  
Somewhere between four thirty and five. He stayed on the Red Line and got off at the Tenleytown Station. I followed him for about three blocks before I lost him. I didn’t want to get too far from the station; not exactly my neck of the woods, you know.”  
  
  “Okay, that’s all I need. I’ll be there tomorrow. I’m assuming you’re tied up all day.”  
  
  “All day and all night. We’re doing the Smithsonian tomorrow.”  
  
  “Have fun. I’ll text you tomorrow night.”  
  
  Theo was relieved to have an adult involved, even if the adult was Uncle Ike. He was worried, though, about the old guy’s appearance. Ike was in his mid-sixties and not aging that well. He wore his white hair long and tied in a ponytail. He had a scraggly gray beard, and usually wore funky T-shirts, battered old jeans, weird eyeglasses, and sandals, even in cold weather. All in all, Ike Boone was the kind of person who attracts more attention than deflects it. He tended to keep to himself, but he was still known around town. If Pete Duffy had ever met Ike, or seen him, there was a good chance he would remember him. Surely Ike would go heavy on the disguises.  
  
  In the darkness, and long after the other three had sacked out, Theo stared at the ceiling and thought of Pete Duffy and the murder he committed. On the one hand, he was thrilled to be involved in his capture. But, on the other, he was terrified over what it could mean. Pete Duffy had some dangerous friends, and they were still hanging around Strattenburg.  
  
  If it was indeed Pete Duffy, and if they caught him and hauled him back for another trial, Theo would not want his name mentioned.  
  
  Ike? He wouldn’t care. Ike had survived three years in prison. He feared nothing.  
  
  Chapter 4  
  
  At nine a.m. Friday, the four buses from Strattenburg pulled up to the east entrance of the Smithsonian Institution and all the eighth graders spilled out. The Smithsonian is the largest museum in the world, and a person could spend a week there and not see everything. In planning the day, Mr. Mount had explained to his class that the Smithsonian is actually a group of nineteen different museums and a zoo, along with a bunch of collections and galleries, and eleven of the nineteen are located on the Mall. It is home to about 138 million items, everything imaginable, and is nicknamed the “nation’s attic.” Thirty million people each year visit the Smithsonian.  
  
  The students divided into groups. Theo and about forty others headed for the National Air and Space Museum. They spent two hours there, then regrouped and headed for the National Museum of American History.  
  
  At two thirty, Theo received a text from Ike that read: In town, about to check out the Metro system. Theo was tired of museums and wished he could sneak away and do detective work with Ike. By five p.m., he felt as though he had seen at least 100 million items and needed a break. They boarded the buses and returned to the hotel for dinner.  
  
  At six forty-five, while Theo was resting in his room and watching television, he received another text from Ike: Downstairs in lobby. Can u come down?  
  
  Theo replied: Sure. He told Chase, Woody, and Aaron that his uncle had stopped by the hotel and wanted to say hello. Minutes later, he was walking through the lobby and couldn’t find Ike. Finally, a man sitting in a coffee bar waved at him, and Theo realized it was his uncle. Dark suit, brown leather shoes, white shirt, no tie, and some type of beret on his head that covered most of his white hair. The rest, the long part, was stuffed under his collar. Theo would never have recognized him.  
  
  Ike was sipping coffee and smiling at his favorite nephew. “So how’s the great tour of Washington going?” he asked.  
  
  Theo gave a heavy sigh as if he were exhausted. He rattled off the adventures of the day at the Smithsonian, and said, “Tonight, we’re watching a documentary film at the Newseum. Tomorrow we do the Washington Monument, and then visit the war memorials. Sunday, we see the Capitol, the White House, and the Jefferson Memorial, and by Monday I think I’ll be ready to head home.”  
  
  “But you’re having fun, right?”  
  
  “Sure, a lot of fun. Ford’s Theatre was pretty cool. So was the Lincoln Memorial. Did you see Pete Duffy?”  
  
  “Are you going to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial?”  
  
  “Yes, it’s on the schedule.”  
  
  “Well, when you get there, look for the name of Joel Furniss. We grew up together and finished high school at the same time. He was the first boy from Stratten County to be killed in Vietnam, in 1965. There were four others, and their names are on the monument outside our courthouse. You’ve probably seen it.”  
  
  “I have. I see it all the time. We studied that war in history, and, I gotta say, I really don’t understand it.”  
  
  “Well, neither did we. It was a national tragedy.” Ike took a sip of coffee and seemed to gaze far away for a moment.  
  
  “Did you see Pete Duffy?” Theo asked.  
  
  “Oh yes,” Ike said, snapping back and glancing around, as if the wrong people might be listening. No one was sitting within thirty feet. Theo glanced into the wide, open lobby and saw Mr. Mount walk through in the distance.  
  
  Ike continued, “I camped out in the Judiciary Square Station, two stops before Metro Center, where you guys got on yesterday. I saw no one who looked familiar. The train arrived at four forty-five. Eight cars. I got in number three, looked around as quickly as possible, did not see anyone. At the Metro Center stop, I moved to the fourth car. No one. At the Farragut North Station, I moved to the fifth car, and, bingo. It was crowded, as you said, and I slowly moved closer to the man we’re calling Pete Duffy. He was lost behind his newspaper, but I could see the side of his face. He never looked up, never looked around, he was lost in his own world. I backed away and stayed hidden in the crowd. As we approached the Tenleytown Station, he folded his newspaper and stood up. When the train stopped, he got off. I tagged along and was able to follow him to a small apartment building on Forty-Fourth Street. He ducked inside. I assume that’s where he’s hiding.”  
  
  “Why would he hide in Washington? Why not Mexico or Australia?”  
  
  “Because that’s where we expect him to be. Often, it’s the guy who’s hiding in plain sight that’s never discovered.”  
  
  “I saw a movie one time where this guy was running from the FBI, and he had all kinds of plastic surgery to redo his face. You think Duffy’s done that?”  
  
  “No, but he’s definitely changed hair color and grown a mustache. He’s wearing glasses, but they’re fake. I watched him read the newspaper, and he did so while looking over his glasses.”  
  
  “So why is he here?”  
  
  “Don’t know, but he could be waiting on a fresh set of papers—driver’s license, birth certificate, Social Security card, passport. There are a lot of good forgers here in DC, shady outfits that can produce all manner of paperwork that looks legitimate. It’s not easy leaving the country on the run, and it can be even harder entering another country without good paperwork. Also, maybe he’s staying close to his money. Maybe he has a friend or two here and they’re helping him plan his escape. I don’t know, Theo, but I’ll bet he’s not staying here for long.”  
  
  “Okay, Uncle Ike, you’re the adult. What’s the plan?”  
  
  “Well, we have to move fast. My flight doesn’t leave until noon tomorrow, so I’m thinking about getting up early and getting back on the train. I’ll try and pick him up at the Tenleytown Station and follow him in, try and see where he goes during the day. I’m going to be very careful because if he gets suspicious he’ll just vanish again. Then I’ll hop on the plane and be back in Strattenburg tomorrow night. Have you ever heard of some software called FuzziFace?”  
  
  “No. What is it?”  
  
  “You download it, costs about a hundred bucks, and you match up photographs of faces to identify whoever you’re looking for. I’ll find an old photo of Pete Duffy, probably one from the newspaper’s archives, and try to match it with a still shot from your video. If it nails him, the next step is to go to the police. I play poker every Thursday night with a retired detective named Slats Stillman, an old guy who’s still in  
thick with the police chief. I’m thinking of running it by Slats and getting his advice. I figure the police will move quick. With some luck, they’ll have Duffy in custody in a matter of days. They’ll hustle him back to Strattenburg for another trial.”  
  
  “A big trial, right?”  
  
  “Just like the last one, only Duffy will also face charges of taking flight and being a fugitive. His goose is cooked, Theo, and you’re the hero.”  
  
  “I don’t want to be the hero, Ike. I keep thinking about Omar Cheepe and Paco and those other tough guys who work for Pete Duffy. I’m sure they’re still around. I don’t want my name mentioned.”  
  
  “I’m sure we can keep things quiet.”  
  
  “And if there’s a big trial, that means Bobby Escobar will have to testify.”  
  
  “Of course it does. He’s the star witness. He’s still in town, right?”  
  
  “I think so, but . . . the last time I talked to Julio they were all living in the same apartment, still waiting on immigration documents.”  
  
  “Does Bobby still work at the golf course?”  
  
  “I think so. This worries me, Ike.”  
  
  “Look, Theo, I’m sure the police will be very careful in dealing with Bobby Escobar. The prosecution’s case is pretty weak without him, and the police will protect him. We can’t allow thugs to influence our judicial system. Come on, you’re a lawyer, you know how important it is to have fair trials. Judge Gantry will be in charge, and if he gets wind of any type of threats made to a witness, he’ll lower the boom on Duffy and his gang. It’s time to step up.”  
  
  Theo suspected that Ike’s eagerness to nail Duffy and to protect the idea of fair trials also had something to do with the reward money: $100,000.  
  
  Theo said, “I need to go. Be careful tomorrow.”  
  
  “I’m not getting caught, Theo. You didn’t recognize me, did you?”  
  
  “No, and you look nice for a change, almost like a real lawyer.”  
  
  “Gee, thanks. And I have another disguise for tomorrow, then, it’s back to the old wardrobe.”  
  
  “Thanks for coming, Ike.”  
  
  “I wouldn’t miss it for the world. I haven’t had this much excitement since I got out of prison.”  
  
  “See you later.”  
  
  “You take care and have some fun. And, Theo, nice work.”  
  
  As Theo rode the elevator back to his room, he asked himself if he was doing the right thing. Bringing a murderer to justice sounded great, but there could be a price to pay. He thought about calling his parents and telling them, but such a call would only worry them. He was supposed to be in Washington having a ball as a tourist, not playing detective and stalking a killer.  
  
  He trusted his uncle. Ike always knew what to do.  
  
  • • •  
  
  Early Saturday morning, Theo, his roommates, and forty other students got off the bus near the Mall and headed toward the Washington Monument. As they got closer to it, Mr. Mount began a walking tour. He explained that the monument, built of course to honor our first president, is a true obelisk and is constructed of marble and granite. At 555 feet in height it is still the world’s tallest all-stone obelisk. When it was completed in 1884, it was the tallest structure in the world, a record it held until 1889 when the Eiffel Tower was finished in Paris. Construction was started in 1848, and it took six years to build the first 150 feet. Then, for a number of reasons, including a shortage of money and the Civil War, work on the monument was halted for twenty-three years.  
  
  Theo wasn’t sure about the other students, but after two days of nonstop history lessons, the dates and numbers were beginning to run together.  
  
  They gathered at the base of the monument, waited in line for almost an hour, then entered the ground floor lobby. A friendly park ranger guided them to an elevator and locked the door. Seventy seconds later, they stepped out and onto an observation deck five hundred feet above the ground. The views were stunning. To the west were the Reflecting Pool and the Lincoln Memorial. To the north were The Ellipse and the White House. To the east was the magnificent US Capitol. To the southeast were the Smithsonian and rows of government buildings. Below the observation deck was a museum filled with even more history.  
  
  After two long hours, the students were ready to move on. They descended in the elevator and left the lobby.  
  
  At eleven forty-six, Theo got a text from Ike: No sign of Duffy. Must have different routine for Sat. At airport, headed home. C U there.  
  
  Chapter 5  
  
  Mrs. Boone picked Theo up at the school Monday afternoon. During the ten-minute drive home, she wanted to know every detail about the trip and Washington. Theo was tired—he had slept little Sunday night because Woody and Aaron played a stupid game to see which one could stay awake until morning, and he hadn’t slept on the bus because there had been a lot of punching, slapping, loud music, laughing, and, of course, passing of gas—so he had little to say to his mother. He promised her he would give her a full report after a nap. At home, she fixed him a grilled cheese sandwich and asked him when was the last time he took a shower. He thought it was either Friday or Saturday, and she instructed him to take one right then, after lunch. When Theo was in the shower, she went back to the office.  
  
  Theo Boone did not take naps. Even though he was dead tired, he had somewhere to go. It was, after all, Monday afternoon and he was required to visit Ike. He did not always look forward to these visits, but today was different. They had important business.  
  
  Ike had been able to run a number of photos of Pete Duffy through FuzziFace, and Theo was eager to know what he had found.  
  
  It was the old Ike—no dark suit, no white shirt and tie, no shiny leather loafers. Instead, he was wearing his standard office attire of faded jeans, faded T-shirt, and sandals. Bob Dylan was singing softly on the stereo when Theo and Judge bounded up the stairs to his messy office. Ike was excited and spent fifteen minutes showing Theo the various images of Pete Duffy on his laptop. The FuzziFace software analyzed every inch of Duffy’s face from the old photos Ike had found, and compared those to a still shot from Theo’s video. The bottom line: There was an 85 percent chance it was Duffy.  
  
  Theo and Ike were convinced beyond a doubt.  
  
  “Now what?” Theo asked.  
  
  “Have you told your parents?”  
  
  “No, but we should. I don’t like keeping secrets from them, especially something as big as this. They might even be ticked off when we tell them everything we’ve already done.”  
  
  “Okay, I agree. When do you want to tell them?”  
  
  “How about now? They’re both in the office. It’s Monday, so we’ll go to Robilio’s for dinner, as always. Let’s catch them in about half an hour. Will you come with me?

The only coffee I’ve tasted today is the perc decaf from Wilton Benitez. It was amazing. Second coffee ever had that I can taste the tasting notes!!! It truly is super good. I’ve never tasted a coffee like this before. I will buy a big bag if it comes available again.

1m4h7lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoddessCafeTerrace/comments/1m4h7lv/hypothesis_of_what_will_happen_until_hayatos/,Hypothesis of what will happen until Hayato's answer,"As I saw lately, the next chapter is in color and intentionally it's 205. Also, if they give the results of the popularity poll, added to the fact that we didn't have an Akane chapter, it's most likely that the next chapter will be for Akane.

Surely something will happen to her musical career that might force her to leave the coffee shop, but probably given the progress of all the girls and knowing that Hayato must be thinking about the girl he has in mind, it's most likely that Akane will do something, either insinuate something sexual or maybe kiss him or something to try to get Hayato to decide on her (I think it's something Akane would do based on her personality, since at this point she goes straight to what she wants). But this could be good for her since she gets more into Hayato's mind, or it could be negative because she would be indirectly forcing him to think about her, knowing that her answer will come in a week.

Most likely, after the event with Akane, Hayato will be thinking about everything that happened with all the girls, and all the girls will surely try to be in Hayato's mind that week. I think the next one to make a move would be Riho since she always does or repeats the actions Akane does (they're almost like direct rivals at this point). I wouldn't be surprised if Riho does something similar to what Akane does, and that could be good or bad depending on how Hayato takes it.

Afterwards, it's likely that Shiragiku, due to her personality, will try to talk to Hayato in a serious way at first, but then she'll try to seduce Hayato directly, doing something similar to what Akane and Riho will do (obviously, Shiragiku will be stopped by the girls, again).

I don't know why, but after all these events, I think Ouka will be the one who follows. But seeing how the other girls have tried to get into Hayato's head, I think she'll have something more like a conversation with him. It'll be more of an understanding conversation, like she wouldn't mind if he didn't choose her or something like that. I also think their conversation will be interrupted by Ami or the girls, which Seo will obviously resolve with humor (as always).

Up to this point, I think Hayato will have three options as a response:

1. Tell the girls that she needs more time to think about it, that she wants to spend this last year with everyone together as a family.

2.- In order for the 4 girls not to see their futures halted by Hayato's answer, Hayato will probably choose Ami. However, Hayato previously spoke with Ami and said he will choose her so the other girls can continue with their careers. He will also tell Ami the same thing: that she should also follow her path (I was guided in this because Ami always obeys what Hayato tells her). Ami will probably agree to follow Hayato's plan, because Hayato has already decided to stay alone and explained to Ami what he thought (honestly, it's an alternative, but I don't know how Seo could continue the story). The point is that Hayato will end up staying alone in the house, as he should have been from the beginning, and he will surely remember everything he experienced and the silence that now exists in his house.

3.- He will choose the girl he really likes. This will end in a series of conflicts at the coffee shop. If he chooses Akane, Riho probably won't accept that decision and will try to take Hayato away from him or will use everything she has to take him away from him. If he chooses Riho, Akane probably won't accept that decision and will say something to Riho that she will try to take Hayato away from her and that she should be prepared because she will not let the person she likes be with someone else other than her. If he chooses Shiragiku, I think Akane and Riho would try to sabotage her with Hayato (but I'm not so sure, possibly the girls would accept that decision without doing anything). If he chooses Ouka, I think the 3 girls would not accept it (but I'm not so sure, because possibly they would accept that decision, but questioning Hayato about his decision regarding that they are supposed to not get along or something like that). Finally, it may be that any girl he chooses will simply end up respecting Hayato's decision, but with these girls it is unknown.

I think the second option could happen since it would play with the fact that Ami did nothing to be with Hayato but in the end she ends up being chosen by him, something that would also be taken as what happened in Quintuplets, but at the same time making fun of that event and the speculation of the fans.",3,1752990114.0,GoddessCafeTerrace,1,1.0,False
1m4h6mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1m4h6mw/third_grave_dead_ahead_by_darynda_jones/,Third Grave Dead Ahead by Darynda Jones:,"There was a dead clown sitting in my living room. Since I wasn’t particularly fond of clowns, and it was way too early for anything coherent to come out of my mouth, I pretended not to notice him. Instead, I let a loud yawn overtake me as I headed toward my kitchen. That was when a jolt of panic rushed through me. I glanced down to make sure my girl parts hadn’t been compromised and sighed in relief. I had on a white tank and pair of plaid bottoms. My girls, also known as Danger and Will Robinson, were safe.  
  
  Mentally making the sign of the cross, I padded through my humble abode. Trying not to draw attention. Wondering if the dead clown, with his gaze following my every move, had noticed me. My apartment was a comfy cross between a storage room full of pillows and a broom closet, so it wasn’t a long journey. Nor an especially enlightening one. Though I did come to a rather morbid conclusion in those few fleeting seconds: Better a dead clown in my apartment than a live one.  
  
  My name is Charlotte Davidson. Charley to some, Charlotte the Harlot to others, but that was mostly in middle school. I came with a decent set of curves, a healthy respect for the male anatomy, and a slightly disturbing addiction to brown edibles. Other than that—and the fact that I’d also been born the grim reaper—I was about as normal as a surly girl with a private investigator’s license could be.  
  
  I strode toward Mr. Coffee with lust in my eyes. We’d had a thing for quite some time now, Mr. Coffee and I, and there was just enough of him left for one more cup. No need to make a fresh pot, to get him all hot and bothered. I popped the cup into the microwave, set it to nuke anything unfortunate enough to be caught within its grasp for thirty seconds, then raided my fridge for sustenance. Eating would keep me awake for at least another five minutes, and my one goal in life for the past couple of weeks was to stay awake at all costs. The alternative was exhausting.  
  
  After an epic search, I finally found something neither green nor fuzzy. It was a hot sausage link. I named it Peter, mostly because I liked naming things and partly because it seemed like the right thing to do. As soon as my java was piping hot I popped him into the microwave. Hopefully the radioactive environment would sterilize Peter. No need to have little Peters running around, wreaking havoc.  
  
  As I stood contemplating world peace, the exorbitant price of designer underwear, and what life would be like without guacamole, Peter beeped. I wrapped him in stale bread and ate him whilst loading my coffee up with enough imitation product to make it a health hazard. After a long draw, I plodded to my overstuffed sofa, sank into it, and looked at the dead clown. He was sitting in the club chair that catty-cornered my sofa, waiting patiently for me to acknowledge him.  
  
  “You know, I’m not really fond of clowns,” I said after taking another sip.  
  
  Seeing a dead person in my living room was hardly a surprise. Apparently, I was super-duper bright, like the glowing lens of a lighthouse in a storm. The departed who didn’t cross when they died could see me from anywhere on Earth and, if they so chose, could cross through me to get to the other side. That was pretty much the grim reaper gig in a nutshell. No scythes. No collecting souls. No ferrying the departed across a lake day in and day out, which would probably get old.  
  
  “I get that a lot,” the clown said. He seemed younger than I’d originally suspected, perhaps twenty-five, but his voice was rough from too many cigarettes and late nights. The image conflicted with the bright mural on his face and curly red hair on his head. His saving grace was the lack of a big red nose. I seriously hated those, especially the squeaky kind. The rest I could handle.  
  
  “So, you got a story?”  
  
  “Not really.” He shrugged. “Just wanted to cross.”  
  
  I blinked in surprise, absorbed his statement, then asked, “You just want to cross?”  
  
  “If that’s okay.”  
  
  “That’s more than okay,” I said with a snort. No messages to loved ones left behind. No solving his murder. No hunting down some memento he’d left for his children in a place where no one in his right mind would ever think to look. These situations had all the creamy goodness of piece of cake without the added calories.  
  
  He started toward me then. I didn’t get up, didn’t think I could manage it—the coffee had yet to kick in—but he didn’t seem to mind. I noticed as he stepped forward that he wore a ragged pair of jeans and his sneakers had been painted with Magic Marker.  
  
  “Wait,” he said, pausing midstride.  
  
  No.  
  
  He scratched his head, a completely unconscious act from his previous life. “Can you get messages to people?”  
  
  Damn. The bane of my existence. “Um, no. Sorry. Have you tried Western Union?”  
  
  “Seriously?” he asked, not buying it for a minute. And it was on sale, even.  
  
  I sighed and tossed an arm over my forehead to show how much I didn’t want to be his messenger, then peeked out from under my lashes. He stood there, waiting, unimpressed.  
  
  “Fine,” I said, giving in. “I  
’ll type a note or something.”  
  
  “You don’t have to do that. Just go to Super Dog right down the street and talk to a girl named Jenny. Tell her Ronald said to bite me.”  
  
  I scanned his clown getup, the reds and yellows of his hoodie. “Your name is Ronald?”  
  
  With a grin, he said, “The irony is not lost on me, I promise.” He stepped through before I could question him on the bite me part of his comment.  
  
  When people crossed, I could see their lives. I could tell if they’d been happy, what their favorite color was, the names of their pets growing up. It was a ritual I’d learned to savor. I let my lids drift shut and waited. He smelled like grease paint and iodine and coconut shampoo. He’d been in the hospital, waiting for a heart transplant. While there, he decided to make himself useful, so he dressed up like a different clown every day and visited the kids in pediatrics. Each day he’d have a new name, something funny like Rodeo Ron or Captain Boxer Shorts, and each day they had to guess what it was from his voiceless clues. He couldn’t talk well near the end, and while gesturing was difficult and left him exhausted, he felt it was better than freaking out the kids with his gravelly voice. He died just hours before a heart had been found. Despite my original assumption, he’d never smoked a day in his life.  
  
  And he loved a girl named Jenny who smelled like baby oil and sold hot dogs to put herself through college. Jenny would be the part of this whole grim reaper gig I hated most. The people-left-behind part. I could feel their hearts contract with grief. I could feel their lungs fight for air. I could feel the sting of tears behind their eyes at losing someone they loved, someone they were sure they couldn’t live without.  
  
  I sucked in a sharp breath and pulled myself back to the present. Ronald was a cool guy. I’d have to look him up when my time was up, see how his eternity was going. I sank farther into the sofa cushions and took a long draw of coffee, absorbing the caffeine, letting it spark and reawaken my brain cells.  
  
  Glancing at my Looney Tunes wall clock, I bit back the despair I felt at finding it was only 3:35. I had hours to go before dawn. It was easier to stay awake during the day. Night was so calm and relaxing. But I couldn’t let myself fall under. I’d managed to dodge sleep like it was an ex-boyfriend with herpes for almost two weeks straight. And when I didn’t, I paid the price.  
  
  The mere thought of that price gave me unwanted butterflies in my nether regions. I pushed it from my mind as heat from the sultry night wafted around me like a heavy vapor, seeping into my skin, suffocating any thoughts of comfort. Utterly annoyed, I sat up, pushed a dampened strand of hair out of my face, and headed to the bathroom, hoping a splash of cool water would help and wondering how the heck the night got so sultry. It was freaking November. Maybe global warming had amped up its game. Or a solar flare had pushed through the magnetosphere and was cooking us all alive. That would suck.  
  
  Just as I reached for the light switch, wondering if I should buy sunscreen, a sharp stab of arousal sparked in my lower abdomen. I gasped in surprise and grabbed the doorjamb for balance.  
  
  This was so not happening. Not again.  
  
  I glanced at the faucet longingly. Water would set things right. Couple of splashes and I’d be back to my normal curmudgeonly self in no time. I flipped the switch, but the overhead just flickered as though gasping for air, then died out. I flipped again. And again, before giving up. Mostly because the definition of insanity came to mind.  
  
  The wiring in my apartment demoted the term code violation to an understatement. Thankfully, I had a night-light. It cast a soft glow in the bathroom, allowing just enough illumination for me to maneuver my way to the sink without stubbing anything vital. I stepped to the mirror and squinted, trying to siphon every last atom of light the universe had to offer out of the atmosphere. It didn’t help. My image was nothing more than a shadow, a ghostlike apparition, barely existing.  
  
  I stood there contemplating that fact when a ripple of desire gripped me again, seizing me with fierce, delicious claws, trembling through me so hard, I had to clamp my jaw shut. I clutched the vanity as the fervor bathed me in a sensuous heat I couldn’t fend off. It seeped inside me, lured me to the edge, led me to the dark side. Hungrily, I parted my lips and parted my legs and gave it room to grow. And grow it did. It built up strength and power, its tendrils pushing into me, swirling and pulsing in my abdomen.  
  
  My knees buckled, and I shifted my weight to my palms as the pressure grew more intense, forcing me to fight for every breath I took. Then the sound of another’s breath mingled with my own, and I glanced up into the mirror.  
  
  Reyes Alexander Farrow—the part-human, part-supermodel son of Satan—materialized behind me, his powerful shoulders glistening as steam rose around him, giving the impression he’d just come from hell. He hadn’t, of course. He’d escaped from hell centuries ago and was currently furious with me for binding his incorporeal body to his physical one. But that knowledge did little to lessen the effect.  
  
  I squinted to see him more clearly. “What are you doing here?”  
  
  He lowered his head, his dark eyes piercing me with an angry glare. The butthead. It was my bathroom.  
  
  But I’d bound him. I’d bound his incorporeal body to his physical one. How was he even there? How could he be?  
  
  “You summoned me,” he said, his deep voice tight with animosity.  
  
  I shook my head. “That’s impossible.”  
  
  He reached an arm over my shoulder and braced his hand against the wall in front of me. To tower. To dominate. To make sure I knew I was trapped. His lean body pressed against my backside as he braced the other hand against the wall to my right, completely imprisoning me.  
  
  His hard gaze locked on to mine. “Is it impossible because you bound me like a dog to a chain?”  
  
  Oh, yeah. He was pissed. “You left me no choice,” I said, my voice quivering, not nearly as confident as I’d hoped.  
  
  He lowered his head until his mouth was at my ear. “And you leave me none.” His features darkened. His eyes narrowed as he stared at me in the mirror from underneath his thick lashes, hooded with passion.  
  
  I couldn’t look away. He was so beautiful, so masculine. When he wrapped an arm around me, slid his hand down the front of my panties, I grabbed his wrist. “Wait,” I said between ragged breaths. “I still don’t understand how you’re here.”  
  
  “I told you, you summoned me.” His fingers tunneled between my legs despite my best efforts, and I gasped aloud when they dipped inside. “You always summon me. You’ve always had the power to call me whenever you want or need me, Dutch. Or haven’t you figured that out yet?”  
  
  I fought the delicious sensations spiking in my abdomen with each stroke of his fingers. Fought to grasp the meaning of his breathy words. “No, you’ve always come to me when I needed you. When I was in danger.” And he had. Growing up, he’d always been there anytime my life was threatened.  
  
  His breath fanned across my cheek, the heat emanating off him scorching as his mouth sought the pulse point at my throat. “It’s always been you.”  
  
  He was wrong. He had to be. The idea that I could summon him, that I’d always summoned him, was unfathomable. I didn’t even know what he was until very recently. I was afraid of him, in fact. He was a dark being made of smoke and shadows, and the last thing I wanted was to be in his presence. How could I have summoned him? What he proposed was impossible.  
  
  “But as long as I’m here…” He let that statement linger as he locked me against him and pushed down my bottoms and underwear in one smooth movement. Then he let the slightest grin lift one corner of his beautiful mouth, nudged my legs apart, and entered me in one long thrust. I gasped aloud, and the swirling that had begun only moments before grew to hurricane strength in an instant. I clamped one hand around his wrist at my throat, the other on to his steely buttocks, pulling him deeper, clawing for release.  
  
  I kept my eyes open, watching him in the mirror, studying his reaction. The slight parting of his lips. The furrowing of his brow. The fall of his lashes.  
  
  
  “Dutch,” he said in his smooth, deep voice, as though helpless against what he was about to do. His jaw locked together as his climax neared. He lifted one of my legs onto the vanity and pushed into me, burying himself over and over, the act almost violent, coaxing me with each thrust, with each powerful stroke.  
  
  And with each stroke, the current inside me surged with more potency, his erection filling a need so deep, so visceral, it devoured every inch of my being. The raw yearning that lingered in the distance rushed forward to pool between my legs. It swelled like a tide, milking me, coaxing me ever closer.  
  
  My fingernails dug into his wrist, suddenly remembering he didn’t want to be there. Not with me. Not after what I’d done. “Reyes, wait.”  
  
  I felt it the moment it seized him, felt it quake and convulse through his body, and in an instant an explosion burst and shot through me, sending a sharp sting of pleasure ricocheting against my bones, coursing through my veins, searing my flesh with a scalding ecstasy.  
  
  And then the world came crashing in as the violence of an orgasm splitting me in two jolted me from a fitful sleep. The dying remnants of a scream echoed in the room, and I knew instantly it was my own reaction to the climax. I forced myself to pause, to catch my breath, to unclench my fists from around the coffee cup that had emptied its contents in my lap. Luckily, there wasn’t much left. I put the cup on a side table, then I fell back onto the sofa and threw an arm over my forehead to wait out the familiar storm trembling through my body.  
  
  Three times in one week. Within seconds of closing my eyes, he’d be there, waiting, watching, angry and seductive.  
  
  I glanced at the clock again. The last time I’d looked, it really did say 3:35. Now it said 3:38. Three minutes. I’d closed my eyes three minutes ago.  
  
  With an exhausted sigh, I realized it was my own fault. I’d let myself drift.  
  
  Maybe this was Reyes’s way of making me pay for what I’d done. He’d always been able to leave his body, to become incorporeal and wreak all kinds of havoc on humanity. Not that he actually wreaked havoc, but he could’ve had he wanted to. Now he was stuck in his body. A minor indiscretion if you asked me, and when I bound him, a necessary one.

But now he was back to haunting my dreams. At least when he’d entered my dreams before, I actually got some sleep between rounds of hide-and-seek and tug-of-war. Now, I close my eyes for a second and he’s there in the most intense way possible. As long as I’m asleep, we’re going at it like rabbits on a bunny farm.  
  
  And the worst part of the whole thing lay in the fact that he really was pissed as hell at me. As a result, he had no desire to be there. He was angry, consumed with rage, and yet oh so passionate, like he couldn’t help himself. Like he couldn’t control the heat coursing through him, the hunger in his veins. I couldn’t exactly control myself either, so I knew how he felt.  
  
  But I’d summoned him? Impossible. How could I have summoned him growing up? Like that time I was four and I was almost kidnapped by a convicted child molester? I didn’t even know what he was. I’d been scared of him.  
  
  Just then, I heard my front door crash open and decided it was time to clean up anyway. Coffee never felt as good on the outside.  
  
  “What? Where are you?” I heard my neighbor who moonlighted as my receptionist and best friend say as she stumbled into my apartment. Cookie’s short black hair stuck out in all kinds of socially unacceptable directions. And she wore wrinkled pajamas, striped in alternating blues and yellows that fit tight around her robust middle half with long red socks that bunched around her ankles. She was such a challenge.  
  
  “I’m here,” I said, hoisting myself off the sofa. “Everything’s okay.”  
  
  “But you screamed.” Alarmed, she scanned the area.  
  
  “We really need to soundproof these walls.” She lived right across the hall and could apparently hear a feather drop in my kitchen.  
  
  After taking a moment to catch her breath, she leveled a cold stare at me. “Charley, damn it.”  
  
  “You know, I get called that a lot,” I said, padding toward the bathroom, “but Charley Damn It’s not really my name.”  
  
  She stepped toward my bookcase and braced herself with one hand while the other tried to still her beating heart. Then she glared. It was funny. Just as she opened her mouth to say something, she noticed the plethora of empty coffee cups scattered about the place. Then she glared again. It was still funny.  
  
  “Have you been drinking all night?”  
  
  I disappeared into the bathroom, came back with a toothbrush in my mouth, then pointed toward the front door with raised brows. “Break and enter much?”  
  
  She stepped around me and closed the door. “We need to talk.”  
  
  Uh-oh. Scolding time. She’d been scolding me every day for a week. At first, I could lie about my lack of sleep and she’d fall for it, but she started suspecting insomnia when I began seeing purple elephants in the air vents at the office. I knew I shouldn’t have asked her about them. I thought maybe she’d redecorated.  
  
  I went to my bedroom and changed into a fresh pair of pj’s, then asked, “Want coffee?” as I headed that way.  
  
  “It’s three thirty in the morning.”  
  
  “Okay. Want coffee?”  
  
  “No. Sit down.” When I paused midstride and raised my brows in questions, she set a stubborn tilt to her jaw. “I told you, we need to talk.”  
  
  “Does this have anything to do with that mustache I drew on you while you were sleeping the other night?” I lowered myself slowly onto the sofa, keeping a wary eye on her, just in case.  
  
  “No. This has to do with drugs.”  
  
  My jaw fell open. I almost lost my toothbrush. “You’re on drugs?”  
  
  She pressed her mouth together. “No. You are.”  
  
  “I’m on drugs?” I asked, stunned. I had no idea.  
  
  “Charley,” Cookie said, her voice sympathetic, “how long has it been since you’ve slept?”  
  
  With a loud sigh that bordered on a whine, I counted on my fingers. “Around thirteen days, give or take.”  
  
  Her eyes widened with shock. After she let that sink in, she asked, “And you’re not on anything?”  
  
  I took the toothbrush out of my mouth. “Besides Crest?”  
  
  “Then how are you doing it?” She leaned forward, her brows glued together in concern. “How are you not sleeping for days at a time?”  
  
  “I don’t know. I just don’t close my eyes.”  
  
  “Charley, that’s impossible. And probably dangerous.”  
  
  “Not at all,” I assured her. “I’m drinking lots of coffee. And I hardly ever fall asleep while driving.”  
  
  “Oh, my gosh.” She let her head drop into her palm.  
  
  I popped the toothbrush back into my mouth with a smile. People like Cookie were hard to come by. Stalwart. Loyal. Easy to punk. “Hon, I’m not like you, remember?”  
  
  She focused on me again. “You’re still human. Just because you heal really fast and can see the departed and you have this uncanny ability to convince the most mundane of persons to try to kill you—”  
  
  “But he’s so mad at me, Cook.” I lowered my head, the sadness of my situation creeping up on me.  
  
  She stopped and absorbed my statement before commenting. “Tell me exactly what’s going on.”  
  
  “’Kay. Need coffee first.”  
  
  “It’s three thirty in the morning.”  
  
  Ten minutes later, we both had a cup of coffee à la fresco, and I was in the middle of describing my dreams—if one could call them that—to a starry-eyed divorcée with lust in her loins. She already knew about my binding Reyes to his physical body, but she didn’t know about the dreams. Not entirely. I’d just told her about my most recent encounter with God Reyes, a being forged in the fires of hell, created from beauty and sin and fused together with the blistering heat of sensuality.  
  
  I fanned myself and refocused on her.  
  
  “He was actually—”  
  
  “Yep,” I said.  
  
  “And he put your leg—?”  
  
  “Yep. I think for ease of access.”  
  
  “Oh, my.” A hand floated up to cover her heart.  
  
  “Yep again. But that’s the cool part. The orgasmic part. The part where he touches me and kisses me and strokes me in the most amazing places.”  
  
  “He kissed you?”  
  
  “Well, no, not this morning,” I said, shaking my head. “But sometimes he does. Strange thing is, he doesn’t want to be there. He doesn’t want to be with me. And yet, the minute I close my eyes, there he is. Fierce. Sexy. Pissed as hell.”  
  
  “But he actually lifted your leg—?”  
  
  “Cookie,” I said, grabbing her arm and forcing her to focus, “you have to get past that part.”  
  
  “Right.” She blinked and shook her head. “Right, sorry. Well, I can certainly see why you don’t want to experience that kind of trauma night after night.”  
  
  “But I don’t get any actual rest. I swear I’m more exhausted when I wake up, like, three minutes later. And he’s just so mad at me.”  
  
  “Well, you did bind him for all eternity.”  
  
  I sighed. “Surely it’s not for all eternity. I mean, I can fix this.” I decided to leave out the part where I’d already tried to unbind him and failed miserably. “I’ll figure out how to unbind him, don’t you think?”  
  
  “You’re asking me?” she asked, balking at the very idea. “This is your world, hon. I’m just an innocent bystander.” She looked at my Looney Tunes clock.  
  
  As usual, my selfless concern for my fellow man amazed me. “You need to get back to bed,” I said, taking her cup and heading for the kitchen. “You can get in a good two hours before you have to get Amber up for school.” Amber was Cookie’s twelve-going-on-thirty-year-old daughter.  
  
  “I just drank a cup of coffee.”  
  
  “Like that ever stopped you.”  
  
  “True.” She stood and headed for the door. “Oh, I meant to tell you, Garrett called. He might have a case for you. Said he’d get in touch this morning.”  
  
  Garrett Swopes was a bond enforcement agent whose dark skin made the silver in his eyes glisten every time he smiled, a feature most women found attractive. I just found him annoying. We’d weathered some rough times, he and I, li  
ke when he accidently found out about my otherworldly status and decided to have me committed.  
  
  For the most part, he was okay. For the rest, he could bite me. But as a skiptracer, he was phenomenal and came in super-duper handy at times.  
  
  “A case, huh?” That sounded intriguing. And slightly more profitable than sitting around twiddling my thumbs. “Maybe I’ll just run over there and talk to him about it in person.”  
  
  She stopped halfway out the door and looked back at me. “It’s a quarter past four.”  
  
  A huge smile slid across my face.  
  
  Her own expression turned dreamy again. “Can I come?”  
  
  “No.” I pushed her out the door. “You have to get some sleep. Somebody has to be sane during regular office hours, and it’s not going to be me, missy.”  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  A little over fifteen minutes later, as I stood knocking on Garrett Swopes’s door in my Juicy Couture pajamas and pink bunny slippers, I realized I may have died on the way over. I was so tired, I could no longer feel life flowing through me. My fingers were numb. My lips were swollen. And my eyelids had dried to the consistency of sandpaper, their sole purpose to irritate and drive the will to survive right out of me.  
  
  Yep, I was most likely dead.  
  
  I knocked again as a shiver rippled down my spine, hoping somewhere in the back of my mind that my probable deadness wouldn’t keep me from performing my supernatural duty, which was basically to stand there while dead people who hadn’t crossed immediately after their deaths crossed through me. But as the only grim reaper this side of forever, I provided an invaluable service for society. For humanity. For the world!  
  
  The door swung open and a grumpy skiptracer named Garrett stood glowering at me with a fury I found difficult to describe, which meant I probably hadn’t died after all. He looked like he had a hangover. When hungover, Garrett could barely see elephants, much less the departed. He managed to growl a question from between his clenched teeth. “What?”  
  
  “I need ibuprofen,” I said, my voice distant and unattractive.  
  
  “You need therapy.” It was amazing how easily I could understand him, considering he had yet to unclench his teeth.  
  
  “I need ibuprofen,” I said with a frown, in case he didn’t hear me the first time. “I’m not kidding.”  
  
  “I’m not either.”  
  
  “But I wasn’t kidding first.”  
  
  With a loud sigh, he stood back and motioned me inside the bat cave. I looked down at my bunny slippers, silently begging them to hop forward, when Garrett curled his fingers into my Juicies and eased me inside.  
  
  It helped. With the momentum I’d gained, I crossed his carpet straight to his kitchen cabinets, flipping light switches along the way.  
  
  “Do you have any idea what time it is?” he asked.  
  
  “Not especially. Where are your over-the-counter drugs?” I’d recently developed a headache. Possibly when I hit that telephone pole on the way over.  
  
  Garrett’s bachelor pad was much tidier than I’d expected. Lots of tans and blacks. I rummaged through cabinet after cabinet in search of his drug stash. Instead I found glasses. Plates. Bowls. Okay.  
  
  He stopped short behind me. “What are you looking for again?”  
  
  I paused long enough to glower. “You can’t be this slow.”  
  
  He did that thing where he pinched the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. It gave me a chance to size him up. Mussed dark hair in need of a trim. Thick stubble along his jaw also in need of a trim. Manly chest hair also in need—  
  
  “Oh, my god!” I said, throwing my hands over my eyes and hurtling my body against the counter.  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “You’re naked.”  
  
  “I’m not naked.”  
  
  “I’m blind.”  
  
  “You’re not blind. I’m wearing pants.”  
  
  “Oh.” That was embarrassing.  
  
  He shifted his stance in impatience. “Would you like me to put on a shirt?”  
  
  “Too late. Scarred for life.” I had to tease him a little. He was so grouchy at four thirty in the morning. I went back to scouring his cabinets.  
  
  “Seriously, what are you looking for?”  
  
  “Painkillers,” I said, feeling my way past a military-issue canteen and a package of Oreos. Oreos just happen to fall under the category of brown edibles. I popped one in my mouth and continued my noble quest.  
  
  “You came all the way over here for painkillers?”  
  
  I gave him a second once-over while crunching. Other than the bullet wounds he now sported on his chest and shoulder from when I almost got him killed a couple weeks ago, he had good skin, healthy eyelashes, six-pack abs. Cookie may have been on to something. “No, I came over here to talk to you,” I said, swallowing hard. “I just happen to need painkillers at this moment in time. They in the bathroom?” I headed that way.  
  
  “I ran out,” he said, blocking my path, clearly hiding something.  
  
  “But you’re a bond enforcement agent.”  
  
  His brows snapped together. “What the hell does that mean?”  
  
  “Come on, Swopes,” I said, my voice sharp with accusation, “I know you track down drug dealers when you’re not watching Debbie Does Dallas. You have access to all kinds of drugs. You can’t tell me you don’t pocket a little crack here, a few prescription-strength Motrin there.”  
  
  After scrubbing his face with his fingers, he strolled to a small dining room table, pulled out a chair, and sat down. “Isn’t your sister a psychiatrist?”  
  
  I stepped into his bedroom and switched on the light. Besides the rumpled bed and clothes strewn about the room, it wasn’t bad. I hit the dresser first.  
  
  “Actually, I’m glad you’re here,” Garrett called out. “I might have a case for you.”  
  
  That was exactly why I’d come over, but he didn’t need to know that. “I’m not cleaning out your truck in search of some mysteriously lost object again, Swopes. I caught on.”  
  
  “No, a real case,” he said, a smile in his voice, “through a friend of a friend. Seems this guy’s wife went missing about a week ago and he’s looking for a good PI.”  
  
  “So why send him to me?” I asked, stumped.  
  
  “Are you finished in there?”  
  
  I’d just gone through his nightstands and was headed for the medicine cabinet in his bathroom. “Just about. Your choice of porn is more eclectic than I thought it would be.”  
  
  “He’s a doctor.”  
  
  “Who’s a doctor?” Nothing of use in his medicine cabinet. Absolutely nothing. Unless nondrowsy allergy medication could be considered a painkiller.  
  
  “The guy whose wife is missing.”  
  
  “Oh, right.”  
  
  Who on planet Earth didn’t have aspirin in the house? My head ached, for heaven’s sake. I’d nodded off on the way over to Garrett’s place and veered into oncoming traffic. The honking horns and flashing lights had me believing I’d been abducted by aliens. Thank goodness a well-placed telephone pole put a stop to that nonsense. I needed stronger coffee to keep me awake. Or maybe something else entirely. Something industrial.  
  
  I peeked around the door and asked, “Do you keep syringes of adrenaline on hand?”  
  
  “There are special programs for people like you.”  
  
  In a moment of sheer terror, I realized I couldn’t feel my brain. It was just there a minute ago. Maybe I really was dead. “Do I look dead to you?”  
  
  “Does your sister have an after-hours emergency number?”  
  
  “You’re not helping,” I said, making sure the disgust in my voice was unmistakable. “You would suck as a customer service representative.”  
  
  He unfolded himself from the chair and headed for the fridge. “Want a beer?”  
  
  I shuffled to the table and stole his seat. “Seriously?”  
  
  A brow arched into a shrug as he twisted the cap off a bottle.  
  
  “No, thank you. Alcohol is a depressant. I need these lids to stay open for days.” I pointed to them for visual confirmation.  
  
  “Why?” he asked after a long  
swig.  
  
  “Because when they’re closed, he’s there.”  
  
  “God?” Garrett guessed.  
  
  “Reyes.”  
  
  Garrett’s jaw pressed shut. Probably because he wasn’t horridly fond of Reyes or our unconventional relationship. Then again, nobody ever said consorting with the son of Satan would be easy. He set the beer on the counter and strode to his room, his movements suddenly sharp, exact. I watched him disappear—he had a nice tapering thing going on—and reappear almost instantly with shirt and boots in hand. “Come on, I’ll drive you home.”  
  
  “I came in Misery.”  
  
  “Exactly, and I think you’ve caused enough.”  
  
  “No, my Jeep. Misery? Remember her?” Sometimes people found it odd that I’d named my cherry red Jeep Wrangler Misery, but Gertie just didn’t seem to fit. “She’ll be upset if I just leave her here on a strange side street. Alone. Injured.”  
  
  He looked back at me, startled. “You wrecked your Jeep?”  
  
  I had to think about that one. “I can’t be entirely certain. There was a telephone pole, screeching tires, the strong possibility of alien life. It all happened so fast.”  
  
  “Seriously. I need your sister’s number.” He shrugged into the shirt as he hunted down his keys.  
  
  “Desperate much? Besides, you’re not my sister’s type.”  
  
  After Garrett escorted me to his truck none-too-gently, he climbed into the driver’s side and brought the vehicle to life with a roar. The engine sounded pretty good, too. I gazed out the window as we swam through Albuquerque, the night thick with an almost impenetrable darkness. The tranquil serenity didn’t help my current predicament. My scratchy lids were like lead and grew heavier and heavier with every minute that passed. Every second. Despite the discomfort, I fought with all my strength to keep them open, because this was better than the alternative: Reyes Farrow being drawn into my dreams against either of our wills, like an invisible force pulled him toward me every time I closed my eyes. And once inside my head, all our anger and inhibitions washed away into a sea of sensuality where mouths scorched and hands explored. Which sucked because we were both quite annoyed with each other.

As a kid, I couldn’t wait to leave, but now that I’ve been here for a while as an adult, and I’ve travelled to tons of different places to compare, it’s really grown on me. 


Sign up for a class at Druid City Makerspace, visit the Kentuck Art Market, visit the Farmers Market(Saturday mornings, Tuesday evenings during summer), go walking/hiking/swimming($15/hour paddle boarding at Lake Nicol on Sat/Sun), get coffee at any number of cute places with nice people, grab a drink and play trivia, watch live music at Nocturnal, line dance (Rhythm and Brews Thurs at 7), volunteer at the Humane Society, walk a dog at the Metro Shelter, volunteer with the Black Warrior Riverkeeper to clean up a river, eat some amazing food (or really cheap food if you want), attend a silent book reading club at Ernest & Hadly, donate some school supplies to pay off your parking ticket (lol) and that’s not even counting all the other seasonal stuff that happens such as ice skating, Druid City Arts Fest, and the Tinsel Trail.


As I’m leaving the public library after checking out a book, I hear people talking in different languages and it makes me happy to know such diverse people live and work in my community. Even though it’s the red Deep South, we have our pockets of blue. You see people protest peacefully, we host a pride festival, we have a gay bar.  Better than some places. 


I’m not saying it’s perfect. I’m still often lonely, bored, sweltering hot, and want to leave like 75% of the time. It is hard to find people that aren’t either a college student or are older and have a family already. I don’t love drinking so that’s tough. But by putting myself out there, I’ve been able to meet some really cool people in Tuscaloosa and have some great experiences. I feel a lot more protective of it; it’s my home and that includes all the people I see out and about, whether they’re passing through or not. Anyways, as a young person all my friends complain about ttown and have left, but I really don’t think it’s nearly as bad as some people say it is!

Twice now I’ve invited her to study together in the library and she’s shown up on both occasions with no hesitation. She doesn’t really talk to many people in class outside of those she knew in undergrad and she’s even pretty sassy towards me sometimes. 

Downside is that she rarely initiates conversations over text or even IRL but if we’re being honest she isn’t super chatty anyway and from what I’ve noticed just eats solo during our lunch breaks. I’ve been trying to get a read on her but just can’t. How can I progress this without crossing a boundary or lead to a miscommunication?

Just sharing this drum & multisample preset creation site I've recently released.


[https://op-patch.studio/](https://op-patch.studio/)


I've been using various other tools for the last while, Digichain, ADSR, Operator-XY and this tool from buba447 - [https://github.com/buba447/opxy-drum-tool](https://github.com/buba447/opxy-drum-tool), but nothing did exactly what I wanted. Many of them were able to create a basic presets with samples, but then on the XY you had to edit various settings, tuning, loop points, etc., then save as a new preset, but this was saved to snapshots, then you had to use a computer to rename and move the preset... Way too much messing.


So I forked the repo from one of the existing tools and released a beta opxy-tools. But it quickly became too hard to manage (single html with vanilla JavaScript), I then rewrote the entire application in React/TypeScript and added a whole load of new features to make things easier as well as making it look and feel more like a tool for the OP-XY.

I’ve become fond of this fairly introverted girl in my grad school cohort. Simple hi’s and bye’s have developed into more casual chitchat, and we’ve recently even gone out to get coffee together in between class. Twice now I’ve invited her to study together in the library and she’s shown up on both occasions with no hesitation. She doesn’t really talk to many people in class outside of those she knew in undergrad and she’s even pretty sassy towards me sometimes. 

Downside is that she rarely initiates conversations over text or even IRL but if we’re being honest she isn’t super chatty anyway and from what I’ve noticed just eats solo during our lunch breaks. I’ve been trying to get a read on her but just can’t. How can I progress this without crossing a boundary or lead to a miscommunication?

Just sharing this drum & multisample preset creation site I've recently released.


[https://op-patch.studio/](https://op-patch.studio/)


I've been using various other tools for the last while, Digichain, ADSR, Operator-XY and this tool from buba447 - [https://github.com/buba447/opxy-drum-tool](https://github.com/buba447/opxy-drum-tool), but nothing did exactly what I wanted. Many of them were able to create a basic presets with samples, but then on the XY you had to edit various settings, tuning, loop points, etc., then save as a new preset, but this was saved to snapshots, then you had to use a computer to rename and move the preset... Way too much messing.


So I forked the repo from one of the existing tools and released a beta opxy-tools. But it quickly became too hard to manage (single html with vanilla JavaScript), I then rewrote the entire application in React/TypeScript and added a whole load of new features to make things easier as well as making it look and feel more like a tool for the OP-XY.

We have had already had quite a journey prior to marriage together such as a custody battle with his son’s mom, family drama on his side, and issues with alcohol abuse on his end that has led to many nights of him exploding his “feelings” on me in a not friendly way. So we have had our fair share of instances to overcome together. The last 3 ish months have been better and I have been communicating some of my needs and trying to find ways to continue to grow stronger and essentially get out of what seems like a dark cloud. We started looking for a home to buy and found one we wanted to offer on so I began the mortgage application. The lender needed bank statements from both of us and when I was submitting the bank statements I noticed a charge from a local lingerie coffee stand. I was absolutely shocked by this so I did some digging and discovered that this has been going on 2-3x a week for at least the last two months. 
Maybe I’m old school - but I consider this a form of infidelity. And I’m simply just not okay with it. Going outside your marriage to pay to have an intimate experience with another woman is unfaithful in my eyes. Honestly, it just hurts. When I asked him about why he did it he kept saying “I don’t know” and “I’m sorry, I f*cked up”. We have talked quite a bit about it the last few days as I’m just trying to understand it and I still can’t. And then today he completely exploded telling me I don’t appreciate him, I’m acting immature, and he has “remembered who he is” and that he will do whatever the f*ck he wants and will not be controlled. I’m so torn on what to do now as I really don’t understand how this has become my fault. This is a boundary of mine, and he knows the difference between right and wrong. I’m just terrified that this will completely destroy my trust and my self-esteem in this marriage. 
Has anyone else experienced similar? I feel crazy.

TL;DR: Found charges from husband on bank statements going to lingerie coffee stands 2-3 times a week and I’m now torn on how to move forward. ",3,1752988610.0,marriageadvice,15,1.0,False

I have been with my husband (30M) for 12+ years, married almost 8, two kids under 3. We’ve been through a lot over the years, including his car accident, mental health struggles on both sides, financial stress, emotional distance, past cheating on his end, and attraction to others on his end. I'm 29F, currently in therapy, and trying hard to work on myself and our marriage. He’s emotionally checked out lately, says he “doesn’t know” if he wants to stay, and brought up wanting to add a third person into the relationship (which I’m not okay with).

We’re not fighting or volatile, but things are distant and unclear. I'm trying to hold things together for our kids and our life we have built together, and I am currently trying to find couples counseling. I’m just emotionally exhausted and confused, and could really use an outside perspective.



Hello Everyone, I'm a long time listener to both THT and FKS, and absolutely love the shows. 

sorry for any formatting, I'm on mobile and wrote this in my note app. And I'm sorry for such a lengthy post, it is 1am here, and I just really need to get this out, and there is a lot of background to cover. I'm honestly extremely lost and exhausted from this, and hope to maybe gain some perspectives. 


Background Information: 

I am a woman, 29 years old. My husband is a man and 30 years old. We have been together for over 12 years, married for almost 8. We have two kids under 3 years old together. 

We moved into a place together my senior year of highschool, and he had graduated two years prior. He worked full time, and I was in school and working two part time jobs. He actually tried to break up with me a month into living together (twice in one night), because he thought I was unhappy due to being highly emotional during the transition from moving from my childhood home. We managed to talk and work things out. 

I am currently in therapy, he is not, but we are looking for a marriage counselor (trying to find either one that takes my insurance or is income based)

He was in a serious car accident in September if 2021, had a concussion, and has just finished the legal parts of that case this past spring. He was not under the influence or anything, but he was found at fault. He was driving to work that morning when it happened. 

He does smoke pot quite a bit, and drinks a few days a week, but doesn't usually drink very heavily. He isn't mean when he drinks or anything, but just wanted to note this. 


Past stuff for context on other issues:

In the past, I prioritized others before him, and told him I would because they needed me more than him (they are kids I had been helping take care of since I was 15, and are related to me). I've been straight up mean/hateful when we were having issues in 2023, which I feel horrible for. I have since apologized, and have made an effort to be better, communicate, and work on myself and how I respond to things. It was something that happened gradually, likely due to the stress we were under taking on the kids after having our son, and it was the 3rd time we took the kids in because of their parents not being able to care for them. I also have had a hard time working many hours due to health issues that I'm still trying to get under control (chronic migraines being the biggest that I have a diagnosis for, the rest I need to do more work into figuring out). So financially, I have had a hard time helping. 

That same year, I found out he had developed feelings for someone else, and told various friends/family he planned to ask for a divorce. I didn't know about this until afterwards. We had separated early September, where he stayed with another family member, and I was in our home with our son and the other two kids, and he still helped with bills. 

But a few weeks later he woke me up at 3am and asked for a divorce, and then left early for work. He came back after work, mowed the yard and waited for his friend to pick him up where he stayed for the weekend. Left our life360 groups, and just didn't communicate with me (maybe one call a day to talk to our son). 

He claims it was because he didn't want our son to be homeless (we were behind on the house and a few other bills) and he blamed the kids staying with us. We had money issues before that for various reasons (me not working as much, him changing jobs a few times, the accident, and just us learning to budget and manage money).

He continued staying with the original family member, and would call to talk to our son at night. He was gone for a week, would visit to see our son, but not stay. But a week later, he started staying with us on and off, after we had a spontaneous/sudden hookup because he was staying later than usual, after our son went to bed. We had originally agreed hugs were okay, but tried not to kiss because things felt conflicting. 

After that, things were confusing. He kept saying we should still get the divorce because he wasn't the man he wanted to be, and that our son and I deserved better. Yet do all of the couple things with me, and stay at the house more and more. Eventually we agreed to not get the divorce and work through things together. We never got marriage counseling because we were trying to get his court stuff straightened out first, and have been discussing and working on that recently. 

At the end of September, I got a full time job working in a factory, and it was 12 hour nights, and he started a new job down the road from my new job a few weeks later, and was an 8 hour first shift. We had to work out transportation, as we only had one car and had to have people help watch our son in the gaps, but we managed. I was going in with 1-3 hours of sleep most days, because I'd have to clean the house when I got him, shower, and eat, and then our son would be awake. So I'd only sleep as long as he'd nap during the day on my 3-4 days of work. Our neighbor started doing the cleaning to help me when she watched our son, so I could try and sleep a bit more, which was really nice.

Well, in October, he did shrooms he got from a friend on two separate occasions. As well as still heavily smoking pot at the same time. And I believe this had an impact on him having a severe mental health episode that November, which resulted in him being admitted to a mental hospital for about 1 week. (Thankfully he kept his job when I was able to send paperwork in for him). I took time off of work to keep taking care of our son, and my work was understanding.

Side note: the week before he was admitted, we had skipped protection during sex (I stopped birth control when he asked for the divorce, since it was impacting me already, and I figured I didn't need it, and we opted to not use a condom, and it was the day after my period ended), and I ended up pregnant with our daughter (I felt it within a week, and confirmed it at week three.) 

Also, during this mental health episode, he admits he cheated on me in spring of 2020 with a woman I suspected had feelings for him years before, and mentioned I wasn't comfortable with him being friends with. He kissed her after messaging her and trying to have an emotional affair. I did confirm this with her, and she said she had tried to shut it down at that time, and apologized for never telling me. And admitted she told him a few months prior that she had feelings for him before, and this was years after they had worked together the first time. 

We've managed to keep communication good since then, up until he left his last job to work somewhere closer. Which has been about 1.5-2 months now. 

At his last job, he worked out on his breaks and lunches, and has since not been working out near as much, even with a local gym membership. I've tried to be encouraging, but he's struggling to get up early to go before work (his job is physically demanding) and doesn't want to go after work because he is covered in grease/filthy. 


Current issue:

We've been through a lot throughout our relationship, good and bad, and have made it this far. I thought we had finally started doing better and coming together, stronger in our relationship. But he's been behaving hot and cold these last two months, but wouldn't communicate anything being wrong. I've asked repeatedly if he's okay, if he still wants to be with me, what's got him so down, and he'd just say ""I'm okay."" And give a forced smile. 

I finally dug in my heels this past week and told him I need him to be honest, and asked ""Do you want to be with me?"" He responded with ""I don't know."" 

I also confronted him about his friendship with a girl at his last job, who he pressured me to become friends with. He had admitted to being attracted to her when he first saw her a few months into work there, and then backtracked a few weeks later, saying he didn't anymore. But when I told him I knew he had feelings for her based on how he talked to her and about her, he said it didn't matter because he'd likely never see her again. 

But she and I are friends now, I used to even send food for her through him because she enjoyed my baking/cooking. We still talk and want to hang out. I don't believe she knows, and she is in a relationship and has kids with him. He also got upset when a coworker said they wanted to try and hook up with her at work (coworker is married and recently having issues) and it made my husband ""disgusted and upset"" by the way he said it. 

But I suspect she wasn't the only one he had/has feelings for, but I didn't want to press more. And honestly, it didn't feel worth pushing.

He also got called a chubby chaser by a coworker who saw my picture, and that really upset him. I have gained weight over the years from health issues and having kids, and for reference currently I'm around 5'2"" and 180lbs. I also started working out again recently, and I am watching my food a bit more, but I am breastfeeding our daughter still, so not strictly. 

He has started making comments when I eat sweets (I love them, and try to keep them in moderation, but some days I indulge more.) and the fact that I drink 2 cans of pop a day, because that's how I have caffeine to get through the day (I love coffee, but it doesn't like me very much, and my stomach doesn't handle it well). And has admitted my weight is an issue for our intimacy about 1 months ago. 

When he was actively working out, he couldn't keep his hands off of me, wanted to me affectionate, intimate, and super loving. And since barely doing it, we haven't really had sex at all, and affection feels much less and colder. 

A month ago, he also brought up bringing a 3rd in our relationship, as I'm bisexual/pansexual. And this was discussed for a week, where it felt he was really trying to convince me, and I repeatedly told him I didn't see it working. First, I am not comfortable with it and having someone around our kids like that. Secondly I know I'd get jealous, and likely be the one left out based on how I've seen him balance friendships and such. Third, I don't think our marriage is strong enough for that at this point. 

This is the second time, and before when I brought it up, it was a hypothetical conversation, because different relationship types interest me on a research level, but I said I didn't think I could ever do that. 

So now, we are hugging, and we kiss, but nothing very passionate. He occasionally touches me intimately (back caresses, but touch, etc), but not much else. He says he loves me, but isn't in love with me. He says that he wants, to want to be with me, but he just doesn't or isn't sure right now. He has given me no reasons why, and hasn't clarified boundaries, even when I've asked. 

I told him the ball is in his court. He can either put the work in with me, and we actually do this. Or we can be done. Either way, we'd have to live together for a bit because we need to fix the house before selling. 

We aren't fighting, arguing or screaming, and things are honestly calm. We both get emotional and cry, but we also try and comfort each other. And we parent well together, so I'm not worried about that. 

Right now, we are looking for marriage counseling, sleeping in the same bed, and trying to spend some time together. But he hasn't given me any more information, and I'm just so confused and exhausted. 

Tonight he went to bed earlier than he usually does on weekends, usually we stay up a bit and hang out after the kids go to bed. But he went to bed right after getting our son down (daughter was already asleep). 

I've tried so hard over the years to be a good partner, and to do better after how I had become a few years ago. Since living together I've always gotten his work clothes, lunch, and coffee together. I used to even get up with him to make his coffee, but I don't do that now that we have two kids. I get up with the kids in the night as needed, I do most of the cleaning, and I do most of the parenting during the week since I work 12-15 hours a month. He gets up with the kids in the mornings on the weekends, so I can sleep in. He's usually up first anyways, but even if he isn't, 9/10 times he will get up with them. And I let him nap once I am up if he'd like. He has been helping with more chores lately, and I always tell him I appreciate it. 

I have been applying for jobs with more hours, and my boss has offered to try and help me get more shifts in the meantime (she is so kind, and listened to me when I just word vomited everything last week).  

I have brought up my concern that this could be depression (potentially late post partum depression). This is roughly the same time of the year as 2023 when everything went down last time, and our daughter is roughly the same age as our son was at that time. But he says he doesn't think he is depressed, but is really hard on himself and says life is just so hard. 

I have told him I will give him time to think. I also told him that I want to work on us and try and work it out, that I do love him. But I told him the most important thing is, I don't want us to get to the point we hate each other. We need to be friends still, and show our kids we can get along and still parent together, no matter what direction we take. 

Side note: I've also questioned ending things over the last year for my own reasons (some of the stuff above, and definitely some PPD/PPA on my part). As well as I always just feel like maybe he'd just be happier with someone other than me. But through therapy and taking my time, I really do want to put the work in to fix this, but only if he will put the work in, too. I have been trying to do everything I can think of for months, but I know I can't do it alone. 

Ideal outcome:
I am just really hoping for things to be as okay as they can be. Ideally, I'd love to stay together. But if not, I want us to be able to parent together, and still have a positive relationship as parents/exes. ",1,1752988345.0,TwoHotTakes,2,0.67,False

I am not diagnosed with ADHD, but my brother is. 
My mum and dad DONT think I have it, because I was never naughty like my brother.  
My partner thinks I have ADHD.
In the last couple of years, I've had 2 friends say they think I'm autistic, which pissed me off, but they don't know each other so they couldn't have spoken about it. One of them said it because I remind him of his autistic step daughter and I learn everything about everything and the other person said how else would i be a self taught software developer and do it as a job.

Ever since I was a kid I have always bit the inside of my cheek until it bleeds, and despite it hurting I keep doing it. I don't do it so much any more, but I repetitively click my fingers or chew my nails. these days my fingers are always sore and swollen. I notice I do it more when stressed.

Basically the only reason I am writing this, is because I've always been terrible at going to sleep, I'm 33 years old now, but even as a kid I remember hating going to bed and kicking off etc.  but the last 5 years I have got really bad, since I bought a house and moved out of my parents. I lived on my own for 2 years and was super lonely, was up every night 4-5am, playing oculus quest for 6 hours straight,  and then working from home at 9am.  Then I stopped that because I was getting anxious about VR messing up my eye sight after I found out I had an astigmatism and started regular gaming. Before I moved out I hadn't really played games in about 10 years.  But even when I wasn't gaming I'd be working on my car or doing random stuff in the middle of the night, pissing off my parents.


Then 3 years ago my girlfriend of now 8 years moved in,  I stopped gaming,  and we've had a baby, who is now 2.5 years old.  But this whole time my bed time has still been atleast 2am, some times I'll be working or just doing nothing, I don't even know what, time just disappears, sometimes I'll  take the dog for a 5 mile walk at 2am. 
 It has been really hard on my partner because I neglected baby duties entirely. The first 6 months of being a dad,  I had never felt so anxious in my life over nothing.  I think it was lack of sleep and also getting woken up all the time.  I still work from home and start at 9am. I do nap in the day time most days, and get a couple of hours kip.

Everyday I wake up thinking ' fuck I done it again, I'll go to bed early tonight ', but I never do. I feel like crap all day, my partner has had enough of my snappiness and outbursts, and I'm sure everyone one at work hates me but then in the evening I feel great and I do not feel tired, and I'll do it again.

I don't game any more, but the last 7 months I've been working on a coding project for my part time business, and if I did not stay up late I dont think I'd get anything done, so I feel compelled to stay up and get stuff done. Alot of times I don't even realise the time, I'll just see the sun out and force my self to stop and go to bed. Even if I took the night off I'll still stay up late.


I did quit coffee for a few weeks  and started waking up naturally at 7am everyday but I was waking up feeling anxious and still was only getting 6 hours sleep and I felt shit all day so I started drinking coffee again to live.

I did buy some 3mg melatonin tablets, i bought them online for jet lag, it gave me the worst night sleep ever, I had horrendous nightmares all night, I was waking up every hour and checking the time and it felt like the night would not end.  It legitimately felt like I had been asleep for 2 days. It was a long night.

I've found if I break them in half and take 1.5mg at 11pm I'll start getting tired around 1am and it doesn't give me nightmares, but I've got a limited supply of these so don't want to use them all up as you can't buy them easily.

I always thought ADHD was an excuse for my brother to be a naughty shite, and years ago when my girlfriend said she thinks I have it I was a bit annoyed. But recently I actually took the time to read and learn about it, alot of the symptoms resonated with me and it actually made me a bit upset. I now see it in myself, my brother and my dad. I always made sure to stay out of trouble because I knew how stressful my brother was for my parents, but I did not do well at school, I just coasted through some how, despite never listening and knowing what was going on or what the day was. I never did any home work or course work, barely revised. I got mostly Es, highest was C in biology but I feel i have  made up for it by doing really well in my profession and being highly paid.

Part of me thinks maybe I don't have ADHD. 
About 9 years ago I got really anxious, after watching something on TV about a guy murdering his whole family, I couldn't comprehend it, couldn't sleep at all, next thing I'm putting stuff in front of my bedroom door at night incase I sleep walk and do the same thing, and then I start moving kitchen knifes out of sight etc. because I figured if im thinking about it that much I must want to do it. Eventually told my parents after a few sleepless nights, they persuaded me to go to the drs who prescribed me citalopram and sleeping tablets but I was so anxious I read the side effects and didn't take them. One of the side effects said sleep walking lol. I had a couple of weeks off work, i felt better but the intrusive thoughts freaked me out for a long time. I think maybe it was OCD,  I read some stuff about harm OCD which seemed similar.  

Also I've had a couple bad boughts of health anxiety, one where I ended up in AE and legitimately thought I was a goner for a few weeks,  was having chest pains after grinding and welding metal for a day.  I could not stop googling it and stressing myself out thinking the dust had given me silicosis or some other lung problem. It turned out just to be rib inflammation, probably from laying in a funny position whilst I was doing it.

I started to be able to induce adrenaline dump feeling by thought alone. My brain started abusing it and doing it all the time.

These days I feel good, no anxiety or health anxiety, intrusive thoughts don't bother me, but I just don't want to sleep.


Is it just me being stupid?  Is it worth me getting diagnosed. Do I really want to take the medications if I am?  Will it help me fix my sleep? I do tick alot of the symptom boxes. But maybe I don't have it and am just an anxious person.

I just hope my daughter doesn't take after me and have to battle herself all the time. Maybe me getting diagnosed will help her in the future. Sometimes i see her chewing her nails and biting the inside of her cheek.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KBO Showdown: NC Dinos vs. Kia Tigers – A Rain-Drenched Parlay Play**

The Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) has had a summer from hell, with rainouts more frequent than a toddler’s temper tantrum. But fear not, bettors! The Kia Tigers and NC Dinos are finally set to clash on July 20, 2025, in Gwangju, and the odds are as soggy as the field conditions. Let’s dive into this same-game parlay with the precision of a catcher trying to block a wild pitch and the humor of a umpire who’s had one too many coffee breaks.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Tigers

The Kia Tigers (-1.5) are the chalk here, with implied win probabilities hovering around **57.4%** (decimal odds of 1.74). The NC Dinos, meanwhile, are priced at **48.8%** (decimal odds of 2.05), suggesting bookmakers view them as underdogs. But here’s the twist: the Tigers’ -1.5 spread is *not* a cakewalk. At DraftKings, the line is a tight 1.51 for the Tigers to cover, while the Dinos’ +1.5 is a juicy 2.64. For the totals, the Over/Under sits at **9 runs**, with the Over priced between **1.80 and 2.02** (implied probability: **49-55%**).

**Key stat to note**: The KBO’s recent rainout chaos has left teams scrambling with last-minute pitching changes. The Tigers are starting lefty **Lee Eui-ri**, a reliable arm with a 3.82 ERA this season, while the Dinos are turning to righty **Shin Min-hyeok**, a 25-year-old rookie making his first start since June. Translation: Both staffs are playing catch-up, and the offense might just *catch fire*.

### 2. Digest the News: Rain, Relievers, and Reality TV

The KBO’s July has been a soap opera of weather delays. Five games canceled on the 17th? Three more on the 18th? It’s like a rom-com where the leads keep missing each other’s texts. Now, the Tigers and Dinos are playing catch-up with their rotations.

* **Kia Tigers**: Replacing James Naill (a 4.50 ERA this month) with Lee Eui-ri is akin to swapping a rusty lawnmower for a high-performance Tesla. Eui-ri’s control (6.2 BB/9) isn’t elite, but his sinker (88 mph) could induce grounders in Gwangju’s humid air.
* **NC Dinos**: Shin Min-hyeok i

1m4gjbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1m4gjbo/boss_is_persistent/,Boss is persistent,"I (M20) work for a fairly large coffee company, and recently have run into issues with my boss. I started out on the night shift two years ago, and everyone on the night crew were all good friends, (like regular hangouts on off days and nightly Waffle House meet up) very tight-knit group of people, and they accepted me rather quickly, and it was a blast, I got to know them quickly and them with me. Well on of the workers, Johnny (M20), was a barista like me and we got closer than the others, duo hangouts on the weekends, and church on Sundays regular friend things. One day I asked him for advice on a coworker who had gotten more flirty with me one shift and I needed a polite way to say “I don’t date coworkers” because I don’t, did once, ended horribly can’t make that mistake again. He helped me through it life was great. Skip forward about a year, he’s been promoted now a floor manager, and I’m on the AM shift so we see each other less. Still friendly with each other. One day that we both had off we hung out simple day nothing crazy, but when I get home he sends me a long paragraph explaining that they have feelings for me. I quickly and nicely said the feelings weren’t mutual and I don’t date coworkers. Shortly after that I start to put a little more distance between us. It’s noticeable, less hangouts, less wise cracks, just small talk and work. We talk and we decide that maybe we could still be friends, we start to get a resemblance of normality. Then one day Johnny sends me a text explaining how he thought he could still manage to be friends but he can’t and how if he cant have the relationship he can’t have the friendship either, mind you this was sent on July 6th, and honestly I regrettably did not respond. I call out of work on July 8th because of some food poisoning, and an hour after I call out he texts me, he said he hoped “I was feeling better”and “wanted to put ego aside” which I responded with “The bbq sammich fucked me up man” now on July 17th he reaches out and asks “if i still consider him a friend” and other classics such as “if you don’t wanna be friends no more that’s ok”. Now today on the 19th I finally respond, which is just way too long to not say anything. I tell him in a very blunt and honest manor “I do not consider us friends” with multiple highlights screen shots from his initial text saying “I said that we could still be friends even after I liked you and I knew you didn't feel the same but I don't know if that's possible.” And other similar phrases. I told him I now only consider us coworkers and that I stated numerous times prior to all of this that I do not date coworkers. And then Johnny responded that his feelings since the July 6th text have changed and that he really wants to reconstruct the friendship, after I told him that I did not, but it’s getting to the point where the people around me have called it “work place harassment” and I’m trying to stay firm on my boundaries that the feelings aren’t mutual, I don’t date coworkers, I only consider him my boss now, but he won’t listen.

1m4ghe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1m4ghe1/jerry/,Jerry,"It started with the screaming. Like many students my age, I have a laptop. Unlike many students my age, mine screamed in undying agony, with ragged breaths in between, not unlike a torture victim, when powered on. The first time this happened I called my roommate Steven into the room. 

“Can you hear this? I don’t know how else to describe it, but it sounds like…screaming?” I asked, pointing at my laptop’s homescreen with urgent confusion. The look on Steven's face went from alarm, then slowly, to skepticism. “Man, you need some sleep Frankie. It’s just the fan on your computer. Did you find my adderall stash or what?” He responded, clearly not hearing what I’m hearing. 

“Uhh, no, nevermind, forget it.” I said. 

“Maybe get those ear-mabobs looked at, the only screaming in this flat is when I’m laying pipe, Ha!” Steven said, giving a pelvic thrust to punctuate the sentence. I  barely made out what he said as the scream droned on. 

“Uh huh, right on.” I distractedly answered as he walked back to his room. I shut the laptop stifling the scream. I rotated the small volume wheel on my hearing aids down and opened the laptop again. Nothing. 

I recently got a brand new model of hearing aid. I was a part of a new experimental prototype program that my local audiologist offered. All I heard from my doctor’s pitch was “Free” and that I could sleep with them without discomfort or buildup. Sounds good. 

But now, I began to have second thoughts. 

I turned the volume back up and powered my laptop on and off, several times to confirm it was the computer. Every time, there was screaming. The anguish of that scream was unmistakable in its emotion, it *had* to be coming from some living thing. 

I tried to attend classes, just to shut the computer halfway through and rush out, unable to take the chorus of screaming. I called my doctor after several days of missed classes and asked him if there were any strange things happening to any of the other patients of these new hearing aids.

“Strange things? I’m sorry Mr. Matthews, you’ll have to be a bit more specific with your problem if I am to assist you.” He said in a professional calming tone. Dr. Richards was in his 40’s, athletic, graying, and felt more akin to a car salesman than a doctor. Peddling whatever new device or drug people pay him to. I only saw this doctor because he was the cheapest appointment in town. Confessing to him about the screaming would likely illicit a stream of justifications or perhaps that I’ve been way too high these past few days, despite not partaking in any recreational drugs. But what else could I do?

“I’m hearing screaming from my computer. It only happens when I turn it on.” I told him. A long silence. 

“Well that is rather strange isn't it? And you’re sure it’s not the fan?” He said.

“Yes, I’m sure it's not the fan.” I respond in an annoyed tone. How the fuck does a fan sound like a man screaming?

“It’s been ruining my concentration and my studies. Can you please reach out to whoever made these things?” I said, more than a tinge of desperation mixed into my tone. 

“Yes sir, I can do that, and in the meantime, why don’t you stop in next Tuesday? 5 O’clock? I'm booked up till then.” Dr. Richards says in his professional manner. 

“Sounds good” I responded, but it didn’t sound good. It sounded terrible. It sounded like I wouldn’t be able to focus in my classes for five days. And that was far too long for my 3.9 GPA. The laptop represented my school life, and my recreation. It was my television for all intents and purposes. I had to stop the screaming. 

That night, I powered on my laptop. Scream. I flipped it over and took a screwdriver to the back of it. I have no idea how computers work, my major is business management. The most “computer” stuff I know how to (barely) do is an excel spreadsheet. But the more layers of circuitry and metal I unscrewed and removed, the louder the screaming became. 

To get further I had to remove the power source, stopping the scream almost instantaneously. There was a black square, presumably a chip of some kinds, the size of my palm, about half an inch thick. All over the front was some very official looking text describing the dangerous and legal ramifications for tampering with it. Assuming that screaming is an acceptable reason to disregard these warnings, I carefully pried the front off of the square chip. 

Inside was a small, bald man about the size of my thumb. He was compressed in the little chip box and strung up to all four corners by some sort of gold circuitry chains. Mouth agape, my eyes nearly protruding from my head, my brain refusing to comprehend what I was looking at, couldn’t comprehend. 

 Except, I wasn’t sure it was a man after studying the figure a moment longer; coming to terms with the fact that this was really happening. While the thing had a masculine face, it was devoid of features, except for two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. No nipples. No genitals. Like a ken doll. 

It started to stir. Its eyes met mine with an expression of pleading awe. The man-like thing started to roil at his chains and yell. A different sound than the scream. A yell of desperation. A yell that would be heard from a tardy train passenger as they ran down their car, unable to stop it; yet desperate for the conductor to stop for just one moment. 

I stood up from my stooped position over the upturned laptop, and slowly backed toward my door, never breaking eye contact with the miniature prisoner. I opened the door and shouted, “Steven, are you here?!” 

“Yeah, what's up?” Came the response. 

“Get in here!” I yelled. Footsteps stomped through the flat to my direction.

“Whats all this then?” He asks, approaching through the doorway to my room. All I could do is point. 

“Is that… what the fuck?” He stood over my desk with the little man-thing still struggling in his chains, desperate to take this chance to escape his prison, yelling in unintelligible cave-man-like savagery. He took some time looking from the man-thing, to me, then back to it again.

“There’s a little man in your computer Frankie. How is there a little man in your computer Frankie!?” Steven nearly shouted at me.

“I have no idea. The screaming I told you about, it kept happening over and over again, until I just lost it, and had to find out what it was, and then…” My eyes scanned over to the small struggling shape on my desk.

“Alright man I’m obviously dreaming or tripping really really hard because this can’t be happening–” He squinted his eyes at the figure below him. “It looks like he’s yelling or something, but I can't hear anything, can you?”

I nod my head frantically “Yeah he’s yelling his ass off, you can’t hear him?”   

Steven shakes his head “No, it must be those new hearing aids you have, able to pick him up. I guess… we should free the little guy?” 

More than a little apprehensive, I shrugged. “I guess so, can’t just put the lid back on and forget all of this I suppose.” 

Steven nodded and walked out, leaving me alone with the little man. He walked back in with a mason jar, with very small holes poked into the lid, and some wire cutters. He looked at me and said, “Are we actually about to free a little man out of your computer? Is this really happening?” 

At a loss for words, I managed to squeak out an “Uh huh,” never taking my eyes off the desk.  

“Alright man, here goes nothing,” and Steven began to stoop over the laptop, tools in hand. I peered over his shoulder. He cut the wires, one after another, took the little man in his thumb and forefinger, and plonked him into the jar. The little man recovered from his fall and looked at us defiantly, hands balled up at his sides. 

Understanding of being transferred from one prison to another seemed to dawn on him as he took punches at his glass cell walls. His attempts proved futile and he crossed his arms and sat Indian style in the center with a particularly large frown on his face. He reminded me of a tiny, angry, Jeff Bezos. 

“So what do we do with the little guy?” Steven inquired from next to me, as we studied this outworldly phenomenon presented before us. I glanced over to the disassembled laptop. Even with the power source removed, a singular red LED blinked. Strange, but stranger is afoot. 

“I have no idea. Do we call the police?” The suggestion rang hollow. What would we even tell them? The question lingered unspoken in my mind.  

“We could probably get rich from this somehow, but how?” Steven opined. “Social media explosion? Would probably be written off as AI manufactured. We could take the guy to some universities? I don’t know man, let's leave the little guy alone for the night and sleep on it.”  

I agreed on one condition, He’d not be kept in my room. We decided on a nice bookshelf in the living room. We said our goodnights and I headed to sleep, exhausted with the excitement of the day, and slept like a log.

I got up late the next morning. No laptop, no classes. Besides, bigger things than my GPA were happening. Steven had gone and named the guy Jerry, as written on a piece of duct tape, slapped onto the top portion of the jar. 

“Jerry? Really?” I asked. Steven chuckled and explained.

 “Jerry is my dad’s name. Was always an angry guy, so it seemed right to give Mr. Grumpy here, a fitting name.” 

Steven had apparently skipped class as well. He offered me coffee as I walked into the living room. 

“Oh yeah, some guys in suits came asking for you this morning, but I told them you were in Kansas.” Steven said.

“Kansas?” I said incredulously

“Hey man, I’m not a snitch, but I’m also not a great liar.” He replied with a chuckle. 

“Well, what’d they say?” I inquired.

“I think they bought it, not sure how, but just asked me to call them if you show up or anything strange happens.” He answered. “But things are already strange, and we have rent to pay.” 

With that, he jumped right into possibilities of fame and fortune. As I was waking up, and listening to Steven and his ideas, I kept hearing a strange sound. It was a tink, a couple seconds passed. Tink. A couple more seconds. Tink. I glanced around the room trying to pinpoint the sound, much to the puzzlement of Steven. 

“Hellooo, dude, are you hearing me?” He said, while jotting things down on a note pad. I realized too late. 

I looked up towards the bookshelf on which Jerry resided, just in time to see him run to the back of his jar and sprint towards the front at full speed, slamming himself against the glass. There wasn't any visible damage to the glass but he’d been moving the jar itself with the force of his impacts.

 He hit the glass with a tink one last time, and the jar toppled to the floor and shattered. His movements were as quick as a mouse and he was out of sight by the time the glass settled. 

“Oh fuck, man, our golden ticket!” Steven exclaimed, getting down on all fours to try and parse out which direction the angry little soul had fled. 

We frantically upended our living room to no avail. We tore the flat apart, one room at a time. We double checked our progress and rechecked again. No sign. 

My computer is toast and my potential future of riches and splendor was dashed. We searched the whole day away. I tried to listen, to try and hear the little guy breathing or padding around somewhere, but heard nothing. 

We eventually resigned ourselves to a day gone, and an opportunity wasted. Saying our goodbyes, we went to our respective rooms for the night. 

At approximately 2am, I was awoken by a sound. A laugh. A low guttural, laugh. The kind that promised menace and intent. A twisted and primal noise, becoming closer and closer. Louder and louder. I glanced around the room, scanning for any sort of movement. I could see nothing, yet the sound grew, and grew. 

Until I felt his little hands grab the side of my mouth and pull, like a high school bully doling out a fishhook into someone's cheek with their finger. 

I sat up pulling the would-be internal visitor off of my mouth, and chucked him into the abyss of the darkened room. A thud, a grunt, and the pattering of small feet padding along the hardwood. I couldn't tell whether the footsteps were approaching or retreating, so I quickly slid out of bed and grabbed the baseball bat I keep at my bedside in case of intruders. 

I held it at the ready, trying to keep my breathing steady and as quiet as possible, listening for the tiny violator. I stood like that for what seemed like hours until I heard a loud gasping choke coming from Steven’s room down the hallway. 

The little fucker was trying his chances on my roommate. 

I sprinted down the hall and burst through the door just in time to see little feet disappear down Steven’s throat, a tiny hoarse laugh fading as though falling into a deep cavernous pit. Steven, eyes wide with the realization and horror of what just happened to him, clawed at his throat in a helpless, frantic motion. He thrashed around the room, desperate to rid himself of his newfound passenger. Until it passed. 

He took in an enormous breath, as if surfacing from a dive that went on far too long. He looked at me, all urgency gone from his face. All the fear and discomfort, gone in an instant. If I could equate his look to another, it would be that of someone stoned. 

 Far too comfortable for the present situation.

 He looked at me and said, “Man, I'm hungry.” and pushed himself past me, and started towards the kitchen. 

“Dude, what the fuck, Jerry just took a dive down your throat and you want to eat?” I shouted at the back of his head. He didn’t even acknowledge what I had said nor what had happened. 

“Steven!” I yelled trying to get his attention. Nothing.

 I followed him to the kitchen to see him on the floor at the fridge, on his knees, shoveling anything and everything we had on the shelves. 

As I crept closer I could hear every slurp of egg, every squelch of raw meat between fingers, every gulp and gasp, and every whimper. I put my hand on his shoulder. He turned towards me. Within minutes, the entirety of our weekly food supplies were diminished to nothing. His stomach had distended so far, it looked as though he were eight months pregnant, complete with newfound bleeding stretch marks, showing glimpses to the slick red meat beneath.

I stared at the bulbous bleeding mass, still expanding, still growing, still… wriggling? I began to see shapes moving and pressing against his flesh from the inside, like watching a newborn issue an unwarranted kick from the womb of its mother. I glanced up from this abominable sight to see Steven’s face slowly start to resemble the panic and fear that mine surely showed. 

“Frankie, I think something’s wro–” A scream cut off the rest of his sentence. A scream I will hear in my nightmares for the rest of my life. It was so blood-curdlingly loud, all of my hair stood on end, and I was sure my hearing was even more damaged. My hands flew to cover my ears and I stumbled back from him and the disgusting mess of food and liquid that lay before us on the floor.  

 A scream that clearly spelt out the end of my friend’s life. His stomach roiled and surged, like a school of mackerel feeding on a loaf of bread dropped upon the surface of the water. Then he exploded. Bloody intestines and viscera instantaneously coated the walls and ceiling. I felt the gore wash over me like a tsunami.

 I wiped the blood from my eyes and took in the sight of Steven. On his back now, stomach completely blown out, reminding me of a beached whale bursting from gas buildup. His face was stuck in everlasting agony.

 I was taking in the atrocious scene when I noticed movement from the bits and pieces of Steven scattered throughout the kitchen. Little bloody men started to rise from where they’d been launched, some still clawing their way out of the ragged hole they had made. 

“Oh my god.” I said aloud.

 They certainly heard that, as they all simultaneously turned to my direction. The ones closest to me immediately started in a Usain Bolt sprint directly towards me, pumping their little arms in legs, intent on finding their next host. The rest followed suit. 

Now it was my turn to scream.

 I started to run to the front door but I could feel them crawling up my sweats. I quickly stripped my pants and threw them against a wall, earning a couple splats for my effort. 

I turned towards them, remembering the bat I still held white-knuckled in my hand. There were about two dozen left. How they reproduced so fast is a true miracle of nature, a miracle I would hopefully never experience.

 My screams turned into grunts and yells of animalistic rage as I played a game of whack-a-Jerry. I got about three or four of them when the main host of “Jerries” reached me and started to climb up my legs. I tried brushing them off but they just kept coming. I was backed up against the front door, frantically undoing the lock as they crawled up my sides, a chorus of tiny laughter filling my ears, filling my mind with their dark intent. 

The door flew open, and there stood two men with what looked to be flamethrowers, or something of the like, donning matching black suits and gas masks with tanks strapped to their backs.

With no warning they pulled the triggers on their weapons and I was met with a geyser of… orange juice? The little men screamed to the ceiling as they melted away into little flesh puddles all around me. Their chorus was almost relieving, knowing what they were trying to accomplish. I sat, back up against my wall, soaked in orange juice and contemplating if this were really and truly happening. 

One of the men started to coat the walls, Steven, the whole kitchen, moving from room to room. The other of the two knelt down to me at face level, never taking his mask off.

“Are you hungry?” He asked, voice muffled from the filters. 

“Uh, what? No, god no.” I responded, still trying to catch my breath.

“Good. I’m sure you have questions but I’m afraid many of them will have to go unanswered. You opened up the chip explicitly labeled “Do not open” and as soon as you did so, we were alerted to your position and identity based on who purchased it. In your defense, you’re not the first and certainly won't be the last.” The man said, standing back up to tower over me. 

“Your friend paid for your mistakes with his life. If you knew anything more, you would be joining him. If you try and reach out to your friends and family with a story of small men, we will know, and we will protect our countries secrets, even at the cost of your own life. Do you understand?” I didn’t, but I nodded anyway, content with still being alive and not a Jerry incubator. 

“Fantastic. Here’s $500. Get a hotel room, and let our cleanup crew do its job. You’ll be able to return at 0900. Grab a set of clothes and go. And thank us, and your god, for your miserable life.” He handed me an envelope of cash as I nodded yet again, dumbfounded and numb. 

I gathered my necessities, and started for the door, frightened to ask any questions. But I needed one thing answered.

“Orange juice?” I asked. The man let out a gruff laugh and responded.

“Citric acid. Any more questions and I won't hesitate to shoot. Protocol is to eliminate any witnesses, but I’m feeling generous, now go.” He turned from me to converse with his colleague. I wasn’t tempting fate any more than I already had. 

I left and drove to the nearest Days Inn for the night. I returned in the morning to find everything exactly as it had been the day before, before the Incubation. This was three years ago. I still live in that same flat, but I dropped out of college that same year. 

That night ruined my mind and I could never truly focus on anything else, knowing what was out there and what could be out there. I switched back to my previous hearing aid for obvious reasons. Every time I enter the kitchen, I can see Steven’s corpse torn open on the floor like a discarded candy wrapper and I cannot stay silent any longer. I have to get this off of my chest before I explode as well. 

If you're reading this, please learn from this and know that things are out there that warrant explanation, yet have none. Accept and move on, or suffer as I have. The suits are probably on their way here to end me, but at least I can die with this enormous weight off of my shoulders. It was either this or a reluctant suicide. God help us all. 

Keep some orange juice on hand, you never know when you’ll need it. ",1,1752987494.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

The RoR profile seems reasonable to me. I will say that these beans are very dense (794 using the Virtual Coffee Labs method), more dense than the Ethiopian beans I have roasted in the past.

I am looking for advice on how to approach the next roast. I can try to apply some more heat early on, but I am not sure how much more I can do before scorching/tipping the beans. Maybe try a lower charge mass? This was a 225g charge. Also, I roast outside and the ambient temp was 70 F the day of roast, so I do not think this is a factor.

1m4ggcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/1m4ggcu/queue_patience_in_autumn_maps/,Queue patience in autumn maps,"I’ve played a lot of plate up, but this is my first time playing the autumn map. I’m currently on OT 46 with 9 expected groups. I’m confused about the queue timer in this map. Typically (in all other maps) when you bring a group inside the restaurant, even if there’s still a queue behind them, you get a boost to your queue timer (ie it essentially rests with each group that you bring inside). I’ve noticed that this isn’t the case in the autumn map, if a second group joins the queue before you can bring the first group that’s waiting inside, the queue timer will just continue to reduce without any boost, and this is a total round killer. 

This hadn’t been much of an issue in my current restaurant (or I hadn’t even known it was a factor) until now as, due to space limitations, I’m not able to have a coffee table and groups are showing up at a lot quicker of a pace, plus my group sizes are 10-11 with a TON of different base recipes, many with variations, and very limited space so there’s still lots I have to do manually (including dishes - I have NO room to automate them ☹️), though I’ve automated as much as I possibly can. So, at some point during the day I end up having a second group join the queue and once I bring the first group in, given that there’s no boost to the queue/it doesn’t reset, theres not enough time to serve the new group. It seems it’ll be impossible for me to beat this day without ensuring I have no more than 1 group in the queue at all times, which is proving difficult. 

I just want to confirm if this is expected in the autumn map cuz I haven’t been able to find any info on it, despite searching. I also haven’t seen anyone deal with this in the few videos I’ve watched of people playing the autumn version. ",3,1752987391.0,PlateUp,2,1.0,False

     I bought the game at a thrift store, along with Vice City, Shadow of the Collossus, and what I thought was Star Wars: knights of the old republic, but what was actually a SpongeBob dvd.  I thought it would be cool.  I’d played other wrestling games from the ps2 era and remembered liking them when I was a teenager.  
     When I went to check out, the clerk had a shit eating grin.  His “mystery game”, he’d called it.  Said it just showed up outside the store one day.  Wherever it came from, he seemed happy to be rid of it.  I asked if there was anything wrong with it.  
     “Who knows? For $2, does it really matter?”
     I’d pay him $1000 to have kept it now.  A million if I had it.  I’d give anything to go back to before I picked up that copy of WCW Mayhem.  
     My wife had taken our son to visit her sister who lived about an hour and a half away.  They’d be spending the night, so I had the house to myself.  After dinner, frozen pizza and a C4.  I loaded the game into my PS2.  It turns out it was a ps1 game and I hadn’t noticed, but it was backwards compatible so it still played.  As I scrolled through the wrestlers, the nostalgia washed over me.  There were the wrestlers I remembered from the time like the NWO, Sting, and Goldberg.  Some guys I hadn’t thought about in 20 years.  Raven, Kanyon, Kidman; I’d forgotten the Flock even existed.
     Then I got to the Horsemen.  You had to unlock Ric Flair, but that wasn’t the jarring part.  Staring at me from inside the screen was the face of a cold-blooded killer.  Chris Benoit.  The Canadian Crippler.  The startup screen had said 1999, of course he’d be in it.  If this was a new game, that’d be a different story.  But in 1999, he was a rising superstar.  
     I decided to play as him.  I know it’s a dark choice, but I liked him as a kid.  And what he would go on to do notwithstanding, he was an amazing technician.  The developers must’ve thought so too, because I was kicking ass.  It felt like easy mode.  I’d do a couple moves throw in a taunt and my special move would be ready.  I hit it, the crippler crossface, classic, only it didn’t quite look right.  Maybe it was the limitations of the graphics of the time, or maybe because I was playing on a modern tv.  It looked like he was twisting his opponent’s neck past the point where it would break.  Then, instead of the usual tap out animation, the opponent just went limp and fell face first into the mat.  Then during the cut scene where the winner usually would raise his arms, he just stood there with his head down and his shoulders bobbing up and down.  It cut to a closeup and I could see that he was weeping.  He put his hands over his face and the game froze.  
     That was weird.  Old games like this freeze up all the time, but was that reallly his victory animation?  And what was up with that finisher?  It looked like he broke his neck, and had there been a crack?  It was in the background, but I swear I heard a crack.  I turned the game back on, but this time it loaded straight into a match.  I was playing as Benoit, but instead of the opponent from the last match, Scott Norton, it was Nancy.    

     This was fucked up.  I didn’t even know she was in this game.  Maybe she was one of the unlockable characters?  But I had never played this game.  This was a new memory card, mint in box, I was the first owner.  I paused the game.  It was just a game after all.  But I was still hesitant.  Just the knowledge of what he would go on to do to her, and that little boy.  I couldn’t imagine what it would take to do something like that.   
     I was about to eject it and just play something else when the game unpaused itself.  The controller was on the coffee table, I was nowhere near it.  Then the characters started wrestling on their own, only they weren’t really wrestling.  He was beating the shit out of her.  Were the animations different when it was male versus female?  I had never seen these moves, they looked meaner and they left a mark on her character model.  Nancy had a black eye and slumped motionless in the rear turnbuckle.  Benoit retrieved a steel chair from under the ring.  He moved to Nancy, but instead of hitting her with it, he partially unfolded it and placed it over Nancy’s head so that the seat covered her face.  He sprinted across the ring and springboarded back at her, drop kicking the chair.  
     This time the crack was louder.  I know what I heard.  Nancy fell to the mat.  It didn’t even say the match was over, but it went to the victory cutscene.  His head slumped and his shoulders bobbed up and down as if he was crying again.  However, when it cut to the closeup, I wasn’t ready for what was on my television screen.  There stood Chris Benoit, not the pixels on flat planes art of the rest of the game, but a hyper realistic rendition.  It looked like archival footage, I could see his veins, his sweat.  He was crying, but I could see in this hyper-realistic state that he was also smiling.  Laughing like a maniac while tears poured down his face.  
     Fuck this game.  I popped it out and put in Shadow of the Collosus.  I went to the kitchen and made white people nachos in the air fryer.  When I came back to the living room though my heart sank.  I dropped the damn nachos, because what was on my screen was impossible.  WCW Mayhem was loading.  I checked the case for Shadow of the Colossus.  Empty.  Before I had a chance to even think of how this was possible, I saw the ring.  In the center was Chris Benoit as he had originally appeared in the game.  Instead of the an opponent, there was what looked like a machine.  A piece of exercise equipment, specifically a lat pulldown machine.  I watched in horror as the character model approached the machine, and in that crude, 90’s video game animation, took the cable from the machine and wrapped it around his neck.  He then looked at the camera.  No, looked at me, and dragged his thumb across his throat, his signature taunt.  He pulled the pin holding the weight on the machine, the cable tightened and his neck broke.  The screen faded to black, but only for a moment.  When it came back on, it wasn’t the game, it was Chris Benoit himself.  It was how he must’ve been when the police found him, but it wasn’t a crime scene photo.  No, this did not exist, could not exist.  It was like my tv was a window, and on the other side was his corpse.  
     After that, I broke the disc into splinters and collected them in a bag.  I burned the bag in my backyard, but I don’t think this is over.  I wish I could be more optimistic.  If I was a single man it might be different.  But I have a wife and son that I love with every fiber of my being.  I know that no power on earth could compel me to harm them.  By all accounts, Chris Benoit loved his family, but he took too many blows to the head and lost control.  Cte is the most common theory for his crimes.  Brain damage had made him a shell of his former self.  An avatar, like someone else is controlling your body.  Like a character in a video game.
     I love my wife and son, but I’m afraid.  I could never explain to her what happened with the game.  She wouldn’t believe me anyway, think it was my idea of a sick joke.  But what I really can’t explain is how a lat pulldown machine got into our living room.

I’m reaching out to the community here because I’m exploring a focused career in commodities, particularly metals, and I’d love your insights.

I am 30 years old, and I currently work as a Commercial Analyst a bank in Gold Coast, Australia. I did my masters in Investments in 2021 and am a CFA Institute member, not a charter holder. While I’ve been working in finance, I’ve recently rediscovered my deeper interest — understanding the forces behind metals and resource markets, the supply-demand dynamics, and the broader macro picture that drives global prices.

Australia’s strong positioning in natural resources has pushed me to seriously consider building a career in either:

* Physical commodities research/trading (e.g., iron ore, lithium, copper), or
* Equities side — analyzing mining/resource companies from an investment perspective.

To strengthen my technical base, I’ve enrolled in The Research Analyst program from Financial Edge (Equity Research-focused). But I’m still trying to work out the right pathway and prerequisites. My goal is to move to Sydney by mid-next year and land a core finance role in this space — either with a bank, commodity firm, fund manager, or even a mining company in a strategic role.

I was curious to hear you opinions on:

* Should I focus more on the commodities trading/analytics route, or the resources equities research path?
* What skills, experiences, or tools are absolute must-haves in Australia’s resource-focused market?
* Are there particular firms, networks, or certifications you’d recommend I focus on?
* What would you do if you were in my shoes, starting fresh but willing to work relentlessly?

Happy to DM or connect over a virtual coffee if you’re open to chatting — and thanks in advance to anyone sharing opinions or even just reading.

I then had an accident where I busted my face up pretty bad. I had two black eyes and a swollen face, not a great first impression. He asked to meet when he finally had a day off but I delayed meeting for a couple more days, until the swelling went down at least a little. I still had a lot of bruising and two black eyes lol, but agreed to meet. He basically had me plan all the logistics. Since we live about an hour apart, I thought we should meet at a halfway point. I told him I didn’t know the area all that well. He said he was familiar with it since his best friend lives there. But he still told me he wanted me to pick a place to meet. No problem. I picked a random coffee house. It was an easy meet and greet, 3 hours passed quickly. Afterwards, he had to go out of town for his annual beach family vacation.

Anyways, all that to explain the lengthy texting period. During this whole time (about 3 weeks), he’s kept steady contact. We shifted messaging from app to phone after we met in person. He started texting good mornings and good nights, and randomly during the day - it was nice at first and we had some lengthier conversation. But l decided to pull back with shorter conversations because first of all, even though we met, he’s still a stranger and I didn’t want to create some false sense of attachment. And two, even though I threw in a million easter eggs in our conversations, he basically ignored everything and only answered direct questions. Anyways, all that’s fine. I met him, he’s more engaging in person. He got back today from vacation and here’s basically our conversation:

Him: are you free on Monday or Wednesday. Do you want to get together? 
Me: Sounds good to me. I work on Monday but I’m free on Wednesday.
Him: Cool… I’ll come down on Wednesday early-ish
Me: What did you have in mind?
Him: whatever you want 

First, him simply stating that he was just coming down threw me off. We don’t know each other. Also, once again he basically put all the planning on me.

What’s my question. Is anything remotely off putting to anyone else? I’m not sure what I’m alarmed about. Mind you, I’ve been single for about 8 years by choice. This is my first toe dip in the world of dating. I don’t mind planning things, I don’t expect the guy to always plan something but I feel like it’s all been dumped on me. Also, I know I could just say let’s meet up for lunch at such and such a place but like I said, something just feels off and I’m not sure if it’s just me with some brand new to dating nerves or what.

Would it be smart to take the 10 minute uber from hotel to stadium to avoid parking? Or will there be plenty of available, affordable parking around the stadium where we won’t be sitting in the lot for an hour after the game?

Is there anything that we should absolutely under no circumstances miss out on once we get to the Green Bay area? Maybe something most tourists fail to see their first trip?

Thank you all. Any advice is very appreciated.",3,1752986610.0,GreenBayPackers,3,0.81,False

Three years ago, I unfortunately had a second episode of stress-induced illness. I have bipolar disorder. During this time, I was tragically physically assaulted in the hospital by staff and my ex was wrongfully blamed in an awful cover-up. 

The profound stress from being framed like this led him to leave me, completely without a trace + ghosting me despite promising we'd celebrate our 6th anniversary once I was out of hospital. He told me he wanted to marry me but couldn't do it anymore.

After weeks of silence he later emailed me saying no contact was best for his healing. I reluctantly accepted and wished him well. But his letter was overly formal; more ""businesses transaction"" than saying farewell to the woman you once thought you'd get married to.

18 months of later, I'd fully recovered and had a brand new job. We reconnected over coffee... he bought my drink and walked me back to my hotel. I told him I wanted clarity about all the things left unsaid, mainly that I wanted him to acknowledge that our relationship (and myself) meant something to him even though it was over.

We talked for 6 hours about our past and present. He said we could never work because of the risk of my illness returning and his fear of being framed again. That is understandable and completely valid. 

But he also complimented my looks, talked about how sad it was that we didn't have a house etc.

He kissed me, and then we ended up sleeping together. Afterwards he immediately said the sex meant nothing. I was upset by this and told him to leave.

Unfortunately, during my third year of remission I relapsed again and things have gotten rather difficult.

It's been 8 months since my last episode, and I'm just now starting to heal. 

I recently messaged my ex, purely asking to stay in touch as friends and seeking clarity and closure on his confusing behaviour during and after our last meeting. I deliberately avoided any mention of our past relationship. 

Within two hours, I was blocked.  

I understand that it's his right to block me if he wants and to not involve me in his life anymore. We're different people now.

But all I really want is a reasonable healthy discussion about why he came back into my life only to abruply leave after reconnecting. I want the acknowledgement that our relationship, even though it's over, actually meant something. 

Ghosting and then reappearing only to ghost again is hurtful and confusing. Not only have I lost a romantic partner who truly understood me, but I've also lost my best friend. This year would have been our 10th anniversary together.

After months of research and testing different options, I've discovered that modern coffee tables with storage can actually enhance your living room's style rather than detract from it. The key is knowing what to look for.

First, consider lift-top coffee tables. These are game-changers for small spaces. The top surface rises up to create a workspace or dining area, while hiding storage underneath. I found some beautiful options at https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables that combine functionality with sleek designs.

Drawer-style coffee tables are another excellent choice. Unlike traditional bulky storage tables, newer models feature slim drawers that blend seamlessly into the design. They're perfect for storing remote controls, magazines, and other living room essentials without looking cluttered.

Here's what I prioritize when choosing a storage coffee table:

1. Material quality - solid wood or high-grade engineered wood lasts longer
2. Storage accessibility - smooth-opening mechanisms matter
3. Size proportion - the table should be 2/3 the length of your sofa
4. Height alignment - keep it level with or slightly lower than sofa seats
5. Style consistency - match it with your existing furniture

I've noticed that nesting tables are becoming increasingly popular. They provide flexible storage and can be separated when needed. You can find some stunning options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Some clever storage features to look for:
- Hidden compartments
- Removable trays
- Adjustable shelving
- Built-in charging stations
- Modular components

Remember to measure your space carefully. A common mistake is choosing a table that's too large or too small for the room. The perfect storage coffee table should maintain good traffic flow while providing enough space for your needs.

After much trial and error, I've found that the best storage coffee tables are those that make you forget they're storage pieces at all. They should seamlessly integrate into your living space while quietly solving your organization needs.

I hope these insights help you find a storage coffee table that works perfectly for your space. It took me a while to find the right balance, but it's definitely possible to have both function and style in one piece of furniture.",1,1752986367.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

tl;dr: any tips on things I can try to get my internet up and running? Seems like the modem is fine and connected just can't get anything else to connect to the internet.

I'm new to the Seattle area, and signed up for quantum before moving. They we're supposed to already be setup in my apartment and had a reasonable price for a gig + no data cap. Upon moving in I found the C2100t in the closet with a few things unplugged and no power cord. 30 minutes on chat trying to explain I \*can't\* plug it in, and to see if I could pick one up somewhere and the only response I got was sending a tech \~8 days out.

I've since purchased a power cable and now the modem is up and running, but no internet on any devices. After logging in to the modem I see it's connected and recognizes my speed:

From the Modem I've been able to successfully ping google and other sites. I've tried switching it to vlan 201 tagging, although not entirely sure I did that right as that turned my blinking internet light off completely until I reset the c2100t. The only thing that looks fishy to me is the time is off which makes sense given it can't get an NTP response:

After another chat and then a phone call trying to talk to someone that knew more than unplug it and plug it back in, I've all but given up as they can only follow that script.

Is there anything I'm missing or steps I can try to get this up and running other than waiting for a tech to hopefully show up in a week?

The poison is deadly, and my days are numbered.","Six months ago, I was accidentally poisoned by wolfsbane. The poison is deadly, and my days are numbered.

My body gradually weakens.

Today, my wolf is completely gone, and I have three days left to live.

On the last day before I draw my final breath, I agree to donate my kidney to my sister. Thrilled, my mate swears that he'll make it up to me someday.

My sister is being swamped with insults on the college forum after she was caught plagiarizing my Belladonna thesis.

But I come forward and claim that I'm the one who plagiarized it.

Mom and Dad are pleased, saying I've finally become mature.

At last, I've become the perfect mate and daughter in their eyes.

But why are they crying after my body has turned cold and lifeless?

Chapter 1

When I found out I was going to die, I accepted it with ease.

My mate, Simon Knightley, came to me with a sullen expression and said, ""Zora, Laila has been in poor health since birth. She's an Omega with the weakest healing ability.

""One of her kidneys is failing, and she needs a transplant to survive.""

He pulled out a Mate Bond Breaking Agreement to dissolve our mate bond. After hesitating for a long while, he gritted his teeth and said, ""Your kidney is the best match for Laila. But if you refuse to donate your kidney, you'll have to sign this agreement to break our mate bond.

""Laila doesn't have much time left… And she wants to experience the marking ceremony before she dies. After talking to your parents, they agreed that I should be the one to do it.

""I love you, Zora. We're only doing this to make sure Laila doesn't die with regrets.

""Once she's gone, we'll get back together. Okay?""

I stared at the agreement in Simon's hands. Ever since Laila Thorne's kidney failure, everyone in my family had been expecting me to donate my kidney to her.

But what they didn't know was—I only had one kidney left.

When they found out I refused to donate, they were utterly disappointed. They kept saying how ungrateful I was.

""Zora, your sister's dying. All she needs is your kidney to survive. How can you just stand by and watch her die?""

My parents wouldn't listen to my explanation. Instead, they kicked me out.

""An ingrate like you doesn't deserve to be part of this family. If you won't save Laila, then get out!""

And now, even my mate was forcing me to either donate the kidney or he'd mark Laila instead.

But I was dying anyway. At this point, what difference would it make?

""I agree,"" I said airily.

Stunned, Simon jerked his head up. ""Really? That's amazing! Laila has a chance now!""

He tore the agreement and hurried me to the healing hut.

Mom and Dad also received the news. They arrived soon after, and Mom threw her arms around Laila and wept. ""Laila, you have a chance now! You'll be able to stay with me forever…""

Afraid that I'd change my mind, Dad quickly had the healer bring over the surgical consent form.

Once I signed it, my parents finally relaxed.

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad said. ""You're starting to care for your sister. Don't blame us for being biased, okay? Laila's been through so much—she needs our love.

""But we won't mistreat you either. You'll still get your part of the inheritance.""

I shook my head, swallowing the bitterness in my chest. ""Just give it all to Laila. I won't need it anyway.""

Momentarily stunned, Mom patted me and chided, ""What nonsense are you talking about? Of course, you'll need it!

""Even if your mate is the top warrior in the Lunaris pack and can give you a comfortable life, you can't just disregard your family inheritance.""

Slowly, I slipped into a daze.

Ever since I failed to show up for Dad's kidney transplant surgery five years ago and Laila donated hers instead, my family hadn't been this kind to me.

And it was precisely because she had saved Dad that my parents insisted I owed her and that I had to treat her even better.

From then on, Laila got the best of everything.

She also started targeting me by falsely accusing me, making Mom and Dad resent me even more. Eventually, no matter what I did, it was always wrong.

I used to defend myself. Now, I just stayed quiet.

Then Mom rushed to Laila's side, and Dad and Simon followed close behind.

They all surrounded her, and it was the perfect picture of a loving family.

Only I stood alone in the corner, like an outsider who didn't belong.

Chapter 2

My eyes stung.

Rubbing my eyes roughly, I turned to leave, but Simon stopped me at the door.

""Laila has to stay at the healing hut for treatment, and she won't be able to finish her Werewolf Academy thesis,"" he said. ""Aren't you working on the Belladonna Cure thesis? It's exactly the same as Laila's. Why not let her refer to yours?""

A pang of bitterness hit me. I knew there was more to his words.

Laila's health had always been fragile, so I had always done her Werewolf Academy homework for her. She had even asked me to cheat for her in exams.

She didn't want my grades to surpass hers, yet through plagiarizing my work, she became the top student in the Werewolf Academy.

In truth, she hadn't even started her thesis yet. She was just waiting to copy mine.

Noticing my silence, Mom spoke in a low voice. ""You know how bright Laila is. It's just her health… You're her sister. Help her out, okay?""

I had heard this over and over again for the past five years, and I should've been used to it by now. But every time those words echoed in my ears, my chest tightened.

I forced a smile and nodded. ""Alright. I'll go get it now.""

This was the last time. I wondered if Laila could still graduate smoothly without someone to plagiarize from after I was gone.

""I knew you'd say yes!"" Simon exclaimed. ""So when I left home, I brought your thesis with me.""

He quickly pulled it from his bag and handed it to Laila.

Laila stuck her tongue out at me, a smug smile on her face.

Gently stroking her hair, Simon bent down and whispered something in her ear. She flushed and shot him a glare.

I said nothing and watched their intimate interaction.

If my wolf hadn't been killed by wolfsbane, it would've been howling with rage inside me.

I turned and left the healing hut. Laughter echoed behind me, but no one stopped me this time. Perhaps they hadn't even noticed I had left.

I went back home. As I gazed at the cozy interior, I suddenly made up my mind.

I wanted to clear all my belongings. Since no one seemed to care about me at all, I'd just discard everything about myself. After all, I didn't want my things to be a burden.

I packed everything—including my clothes, daily necessities, my pictures, the gifts I'd bought for my family and Simon—and threw them in the trash outside.

I was completely exhausted, and my breathing grew labored. The wolfsbane had taken hold of my body, and with every movement, a wave of excruciating pain shot through me.

I was really dying.

It took hours before I regained some strength. Just as I got into bed and was about to sleep, Simon barged in.

Flanking a crying Laila, Mom and Dad hurried after him.

""Zora, you promised to give Laila your thesis. How could you collude with others and accuse your sister of plagiarism?"" Simon questioned, his eyes thick with disappointment.

""Zora, I understand that you're upset about me borrowing your thesis."" Laila sobbed. ""But how could you ask your supervisor to publicly criticize me online? I've been swarmed with insults! You're so cruel!""

""Zora, we're family. How could you do this to your sister?"" Mom chimed in disapprovingly.

Turning back to Laila, Mom patted her back gently and cooed, ""Don't cry, sweetheart. You'll hurt yourself. I'll make your sister apologize to you!""

Chapter 3

So it turned out after getting my thesis, Laila flaunted it on the academy's forum.

Unfortunately, my supervisor saw the post.

He had always held high expectations for me, even offering to help revise my thesis before. So the moment Laila uploaded it online, he sensed something was off.

He questioned her about the details, but she couldn't answer a single thing.

The people online immediately realized something was wrong.

How could someone fail to answer questions about their own thesis?

Accusations of plagiarism came flooding in.

""Laila's been so devastated that she fainted from crying several times,"" Simon boomed. ""Zora, you're her sister. How could you do this to her? Apologize to her now!""

Ignoring how pale I looked, he dragged me out of bed and shoved me in front of Laila.

My thoughts wandered. Why had he grown so close to her?

Five years ago, after my family disowned me, I had trudged through a downpour, drenched to the bone.

Then Simon appeared.

The moment I saw him, my wounded wolf stirred with hope. I could feel that he was my predestined mate.

He brought me home, gave me clean clothes, a steaming cup of coffee, and sat beside me as I poured out my heartbreak.

He pitied me, swearing he'd treat me well for the rest of my life.

Back then, he had loathed Laila. He never met her, but he despised anyone who hurt me.

But when had things started to change?

Was it when Laila began hovering around him, acting sweet like a lover? Was it when she clung to him during our dates, or when they started texting each other over the phone for long hours?

My lover had become the knight of the person I resented most.

I thought I could handle the pain, but it still hurt.

Now that I was dying, I could've just let them have whatever they wanted.

""It's my fault for putting you in this mess. I'll clear your name by telling them that I was the one who plagiarized your work,"" I said.

The moment I apologized, they were stunned. They hadn't expected me to be this obedient.

""You've really started to care for your sister,"" Mom said, her gaze turning complicated. ""I'm glad that you two are finally looking out for each other.""

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad chimed in. ""If you keep this up, your mom and I will surely dote on you!""

Guilt flickered in Simon's eyes.

""You're my mate, so I'll surely take care of you,"" he said, trying to comfort me. ""Even if you can't continue your studies at the Werewolf Academy, you can still live comfortably.""

I tried to smile through the pallor.

However, the future Simon spoke of didn't exist for me anymore. At this point, their love and affection were luxuries I could no longer afford.

Laila turned on the camera and began recording.

""This thesis was written by me at home…"" she sobbed. ""I never thought my sister would claim it as her own.""

As she spoke, she turned the camera toward me.

Dad, Mom, and Simon all watched closely, as if afraid I might slip.

Forcing a smile, I said, ""Laila's right. I plagiarized her work and told my supervisor it was mine. I'm sorry.""

Everyone exhaled in relief.

Laila quickly uploaded the video to the academy's forum. Soon, waves of criticism and insults crashed down on me.

Pretending to be noble, she stepped in at the perfect time to defend me. ""Guys, stop it. No matter what, she's my sister. I've already forgiven her.""

While no one else was looking, she turned to me with a cold, victorious glare and hissed, ""You have no right to compete with me. Mom, Dad, and even Simon are all mine. You don't deserve to be loved by any of them.""

Chapter 4

Laila and I were twins, but ever since we were kids, she'd always resented me.

She hated sharing her things with me. So she stole our parents' attention, my toys, my dresses—even though she had the exact same ones.

She wanted anything I laid my eyes on.

Back then, Mom and Dad treated us equally. I had everything Laila had, and they often lectured her for taking my things.

But since what had happened five years ago, they poured all their heart and soul into Laila. They thought I was selfish for not visiting Dad when he was hospitalized.

So whenever we got into an argument after that, they always took Laila's side.

""How could you bully your sister?"" was what they often told me.

After feuding with her for so many years, I was indeed the one who lost. I could no longer be at odds with her anymore.

""Yeah, you won,"" I said softly.

The kidney transplant surgery would take place in two hours, and I was about to die.

Given how deep the wolfsbane was already in my system, my soul would also be shattered by the time the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my body.

What would be left was only my lifeless body.

By then, would Mom, Dad, and Simon weep for me?

Perhaps not. For an eyesore like me to leave, they'd probably be overjoyed. After all, Laila was the apple of their eye.

Before surgery, Mom, Dad, and Simon huddled around Laila, comforting and encouraging her.

""Laila, don't be scared. We'll be waiting for you outside,"" Dad said in a tone so gentle that I'd never heard before. ""The surgery will definitely be successful. You'll become healthy in no time.""

""After your recovery, I'll make you your favorite dishes,"" Mom chimed in lovingly.

Simon suddenly pulled out a dazzling moonstone necklace. ""I bought the necklace you fancied at the auction last time. After the surgery, I'll put it on for you!""

They were all so focused on Laila that none of them remembered that I was also about to undergo surgery.

I thought I was used to being neglected. But as I neared the end of my life, the sight before me still broke my heart.

I couldn't help but blurt my thoughts, ""Would you be sad if I died during surgery?""

Mom and Dad were stunned. As if they only recalled my existence now, diffidence flickered across their faces.

But once Mom heard what I said, she snapped, ""What nonsense are you talking about? It's just a simple kidney transplant surgery. Stop jinxing yourself!""

Dad also shot me a disapproving glance. ""Don't say that! How could you curse yourself like that? Get sufficient rest after the surgery, and you'll recover in no time. After all, you're much stronger than Laila.""

""I'll cook you a seafood feast after the surgery's over. You love seafood, don't you?""

Gazing at me affectionately, Simon held my hand and said, ""Don't worry. I hired the best healer to perform the surgery. You'll definitely be fine. Once it's over, I'll buy whatever you want for you.""

Bile rose in my throat. He bought Laila's favorite necklace in advance, yet when it came to me, he'd only make such empty promises.

I bet he'd be delighted after I was gone. He could finally be with Laila.

My gaze lingered on Mom, Dad, and Simon before I entered the operating room.

When the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my skin, the last shred of healing ability I had was completely destroyed. The wolfsbane gnawed at my bones and tore my soul apart.

I stopped breathing entirely as I reached the end of my life.

The moment before I took my final breath, I wondered if Dad would weep for me if he found out I was the one who donated my kidney to him five years ago, and it was Laila who took the credit. Would he feel bad for me, who was always on the receiving end of Laila's slandering and bullying?

Would Mom and Dad ever regret looking down on me?

It didn't matter. Even if they would, I wouldn't be around to see it.

If there were a next life, I never ever wanted to meet them again.",1,1752985728.0,BooksPoint,0,1.0,False

I attached a small luggage tag to my keyring with my first name and phone number (no address for security reasons), and it's already paid for itself twice over.

Last month, I accidentally left my keys at a coffee shop after a hectic morning meeting. Instead of them ending up in some generic lost-and-found box, the barista texted me directly before I'd even made it back to my office. Another time, I dropped them in a parking garage, and a kind stranger was able to contact me immediately rather than turning them in to management where they might have sat for days.

The beauty of this system is its simplicity. You don't need anything fancy - just a basic luggage tag from any travel store or even a homemade version with contact info slipped into a small protective sleeve. I was initially worried about privacy, but realized just my first name and phone number provides enough contact information without revealing where I live. My roommate saw mine and immediately added tags to her keys too, after calculating the cost of replacing her electronic fob.

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the color… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

     I bought the game at a thrift store, along with Vice City, Shadow of the Collossus, and what I thought was Star Wars: knights of the old republic, but what was actually a SpongeBob dvd.  I thought it would be cool.  I’d played other wrestling games from the ps2 era and remembered liking them when I was a teenager.  
     When I went to check out, the clerk had a shit eating grin.  His “mystery game”, he’d called it.  Said it just showed up outside the store one day.  Wherever it came from, he seemed happy to be rid of it.  I asked if there was anything wrong with it.  
     “Who knows? For $2, does it really matter?”
     I’d pay him $1000 to have kept it now.  A million if I had it.  I’d give anything to go back to before I picked up that copy of WCW Mayhem.  
     My wife had taken our son to visit her sister who lived about an hour and a half away.  They’d be spending the night, so I had the house to myself.  After dinner, frozen pizza and a C4.  I loaded the game into my PS2.  It turns out it was a ps1 game and I hadn’t noticed, but it was backwards compatible so it still played.  As I scrolled through the wrestlers, the nostalgia washed over me.  There were the wrestlers I remembered from the time like the NWO, Sting, and Goldberg.  Some guys I hadn’t thought about in 20 years.  Raven, Kanyon, Kidman; I’d forgotten the Flock even existed.
     Then I got to the Horsemen.  You had to unlock Ric Flair, but that wasn’t the jarring part.  Staring at me from inside the screen was the face of a cold-blooded killer.  Chris Benoit.  The Canadian Crippler.  The startup screen had said 1999, of course he’d be in it.  If this was a new game, that’d be a different story.  But in 1999, he was a rising superstar.  
     I decided to play as him.  I know it’s a dark choice, but I liked him as a kid.  And what he would go on to do notwithstanding, he was an amazing technician.  The developers must’ve thought so too, because I was kicking ass.  It felt like easy mode.  I’d do a couple moves throw in a taunt and my special move would be ready.  I hit it, the crippler crossface, classic, only it didn’t quite look right.  Maybe it was the limitations of the graphics of the time, or maybe because I was playing on a modern tv.  It looked like he was twisting his opponent’s neck past the point where it would break.  Then, instead of the usual tap out animation, the opponent just went limp and fell face first into the mat.  Then during the cut scene where the winner usually would raise his arms, he just stood there with his head down and his shoulders bobbing up and down.  It cut to a closeup and I could see that he was weeping.  He put his hands over his face and the game froze.  
     That was weird.  Old games like this freeze up all the time, but was that reallly his victory animation?  And what was up with that finisher?  It looked like he broke his neck, and had there been a crack?  It was in the background, but I swear I heard a crack.  I turned the game back on, but this time it loaded straight into a match.  I was playing as Benoit, but instead of the opponent from the last match, Scott Norton, it was Nancy.    

     This was fucked up.  I didn’t even know she was in this game.  Maybe she was one of the unlockable characters?  But I had never played this game.  This was a new memory card, mint in box, I was the first owner.  I paused the game.  It was just a game after all.  But I was still hesitant.  Just the knowledge of what he would go on to do to her, and that little boy.  I couldn’t imagine what it would take to do something like that.   
     I was about to eject it and just play something else when the game unpaused itself.  The controller was on the coffee table, I was nowhere near it.  Then the characters started wrestling on their own, only they weren’t really wrestling.  He was beating the shit out of her.  Were the animations different when it was male versus female?  I had never seen these moves, they looked meaner and they left a mark on her character model.  Nancy had a black eye and slumped motionless in the rear turnbuckle.  Benoit retrieved a steel chair from under the ring.  He moved to Nancy, but instead of hitting her with it, he partially unfolded it and placed it over Nancy’s head so that the seat covered her face.  He sprinted across the ring and springboarded back at her, drop kicking the chair.  
     This time the crack was louder.  I know what I heard.  Nancy fell to the mat.  It didn’t even say the match was over, but it went to the victory cutscene.  His head slumped and his shoulders bobbed up and down as if he was crying again.  However, when it cut to the closeup, I wasn’t ready for what was on my television screen.  There stood Chris Benoit, not the pixels on flat planes art of the rest of the game, but a hyper realistic rendition.  It looked like archival footage, I could see his veins, his sweat.  He was crying, but I could see in this hyper-realistic state that he was also smiling.  Laughing like a maniac while tears poured down his face.  
     Fuck this game.  I popped it out and put in Shadow of the Collosus.  I went to the kitchen and made white people nachos in the air fryer.  When I came back to the living room though my heart sank.  I dropped the damn nachos, because what was on my screen was impossible.  WCW Mayhem was loading.  I checked the case for Shadow of the Colossus.  Empty.  Before I had a chance to even think of how this was possible, I saw the ring.  In the center was Chris Benoit as he had originally appeared in the game.  Instead of the an opponent, there was what looked like a machine.  A piece of exercise equipment, specifically a lat pulldown machine.  I watched in horror as the character model approached the machine, and in that crude, 90’s video game animation, took the cable from the machine and wrapped it around his neck.  He then looked at the camera.  No, looked at me, and dragged his thumb across his throat, his signature taunt.  He pulled the pin holding the weight on the machine, the cable tightened and his neck broke.  The screen faded to black, but only for a moment.  When it came back on, it wasn’t the game, it was Chris Benoit himself.  It was how he must’ve been when the police found him, but it wasn’t a crime scene photo.  No, this did not exist, could not exist.  It was like my tv was a window, and on the other side was his corpse.  
     After that, I broke the disc into splinters and collected them in a bag.  I burned the bag in my backyard, but I don’t think this is over.  I wish I could be more optimistic.  If I was a single man it might be different.  But I have a wife and son that I love with every fiber of my being.  I know that no power on earth could compel me to harm them.  By all accounts, Chris Benoit loved his family, but he took too many blows to the head and lost control.  Cte is the most common theory for his crimes.  Brain damage had made him a shell of his former self.  An avatar, like someone else is controlling your body.  Like a character in a video game.
     I love my wife and son, but I’m afraid.  I could never explain to her what happened with the game.  She wouldn’t believe me anyway, think it was my idea of a sick joke.  But what I really can’t explain is how a lat pulldown machine got into our living room.

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

Fellow Empathetic Apathists, let’s talk. You know that moment when you’re deeply aware of someone’s emotional meltdown—like, you get their existential dread on a cosmic level—but simultaneously, you’re just… meh? Like, “Sorry your world’s collapsing, but I’m over here sipping coffee, wondering if I left my irony in the dryer.” 😆

So, what’s your secret sauce for balancing that “I feel everything” empathy with the “whatever, life’s a glitchy simulation” apathy? Are you doomscrolling X for catharsis, binge-watching existential comedies, or just staring at a wall while contemplating the futility of it all? Drop your coping mechanisms below—bonus points for the most hilariously detached yet oddly profound ones.

Here’s mine: I listen to sad lo-fi playlists to “honor” the world’s suffering, then switch to speed metal to remind myself I don’t actually care. 🖖 What’s yours?
