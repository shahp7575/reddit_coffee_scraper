1st time meeting- city centre movie date, food court t burgers ba icecream afterwards- best coz more things to chat about after the movie so not a boring date

Nature paglus- bike ride to borapani on sunday(only if the other one is comfortable, not a 1st date idea, else she will think of being kidnapped), pamohi deepor beel also works

1st date in natural setting- i guess that bramhaputra heritage park or whatever the name is in panbazar, evening scenes would be ballin, orange sky, river and soft breeze, although idk how couple friendly is that. 

Date with the intention j aji thikse khaam- 4 seasons but still looking for the perfect one. Some Dhabas are good like the rang de basanti dhaba but most are too trashy for a date and some aesthtically pleasing restaurants are too expensive compared to the portions. Who the f wants to pay 450 for butter paneer with 5 paneer slices. Ordered butter paneer to devour not act cute. Balanced ones like 4 seasons and rang de basanti are good so far

Want to impress a non assamese baddie date- Gams delicacy Garchuk one, good aesthetics, spacious and best assamese thalis (although the baati where they serve are very small and aloo pitika bare bare anibo koi thakibo lage, alop annoying)
Also mising kitchen

Café- no idea at all except JB's ganeshguri. There used to be a hard rock cafe in zoo road. It was good. But idk i havent seen it there. Usually I dont go out to sip tea and coffee so limited knowledge. Would love to know great ones

Aesthetics- terra maya, olive garden, vatika and root barrel

Cotton college nostalgia dates- sheikh brothers, reboti, coffee house, baskin robbins, Bellevue cafe, can go for fuchka and all too but hygene issue

1oprcoy,https://i.redd.it/8cx46r77wkzf1.png,Invisible To Her Bully,"Seven Years Earlier

Growing up as a twin sounds fun, right? Built-in best friend, someone who always has your back, someone who gets you without explanation. That’s what I had—at least for the first ten years of my life.

My twin brother, Jackson, was the center of my world. We were fraternal twins, but opposites in every way. Jackson was tall, lean, athletic, and could make friends with just about anyone. I was short, a little chunky, shy to the point of painful, and usually tripping over my own feet.

But it never mattered to me. I didn’t need a million friends. I had Jackson. He was my best friend, my other half, my person.

It was always just the two of us. Our mom worked constantly to keep food on the table, so most of the time it was just me and him. Maybe that’s why we clung to each other so hard.

“Jax, I wanna go home,” I whined, dragging my feet as he tossed a football from hand to hand.

“Jess, chill. I told the new kid I’d meet him here to throw the ball around,” he said, his brown eyes locked on the field like he was already in the NFL.

“This is boring.” I plopped down on the grass.

He sighed, dug in his pocket, and tossed me a granola bar. “Here. Peanut butter. Your favorite.”

Instant mood boost. “Yes! Thanks, Jax.”

While I was tearing open the wrapper, he straightened up, glancing at the entrance to the field. “That’s him.”

A boy about our age walked toward us, a football tucked under his arm. He had dark, messy brown hair and the greenest eyes I’d ever seen. The kind of eyes you notice right away. And his lashes? Long enough to make me jealous.

“Hey,” he said to Jackson.

“Hey, Noah. This is my twin, Jessa.”

I scrambled up, brushing grass off my jeans. My mouth moved faster than my brain. “Wow… you’ve got really long eyelashes. For a boy.”

Noah’s cheeks turned pink. “Uh, thanks?”

Jackson groaned. “Sorry, she doesn’t have a filter sometimes.”

“I just meant they’re… pretty,” I tried, wishing I could disappear.

“Jess, why don’t you go sit while we toss the ball around,” Jackson muttered.

“She doesn’t play?” Noah asked.

I shook my head before Jackson could answer. “Not really my thing.”

“Nope. If she tried to throw, she’d probably knock herself over,” Jackson joked.

I pretended not to care, sitting back down on the sidelines, but my eyes kept drifting toward Noah as he and Jackson tossed the ball. He wasn’t just cute—he was quiet, too. Almost shy. Something about him made me want him to like me.

After they finished, Jackson clapped him on the back. “You’ve got a good arm.”

“Two older brothers taught me some stuff,” Noah shrugged.

“Oh! So they’re your best friends too, like me and Jackson?” I asked eagerly.

“No. They’re just… brothers. I don’t really have a best friend.”

My heart squeezed. “Then you should get one. Me and Jackson do everything together. He’s the best best friend you could ever have.”

Noah looked at Jackson. Jackson just shrugged. Noah nodded slightly, like he got the message.

At the time, I didn’t realize how wrong I was.

One Month Later

“I don’t wanna go to the movies, Jax!” I whined, arms crossed.

“Too bad. Noah and I wanna see the new Marvel movie. You can’t stay home alone.”

“We always do what you and Noah want. What about me?”

He sighed. “Jess, I love you. But sometimes I wanna do stuff without you. You need to find your own friends.”

That stung more than I wanted to admit.

The doorbell rang, and Noah walked in with his usual smirk.

“Sup.”

“Jess, get your shoes on,” Jackson ordered.

“She’s coming too?” Noah asked.

“Yeah. Mom’s at work. I’m babysitting.”

“Babysitting?” I snapped. “We’re the same age! You’re not babysitting me.”

“I’m twelve minutes older,” Jackson shot back.

Noah snickered. “She’s definitely acting like the baby.”

I stormed off to grab my shoes, but I froze halfway up the stairs when I heard Noah’s voice:

“Man, your sister’s such a brat. Wish she didn’t have to tag along.”

Jackson’s answer was the knife that cut deepest. “Tell me about it.”

At the theater, I tried to forget. “Jax, can we get popcorn? With extra butter?”

Noah raised his brows. “Do you really need the extra butter?”

I clenched my fists. “Yes. I like it that way.”

Jackson slipped me a couple of bills. “Get your own small one.”

I headed for the snack line, and that’s when I heard them again.

“She always has to be eating,” Noah muttered.

“Yeah,” Jackson said with a low laugh. “Sometimes it’s embarrassing to be seen with her.”

The words hit harder than any punch. My own twin—my best friend—was embarrassed of me.

“Hey, it’s your turn,” a girl behind me said gently.

I shook my head. “Changed my mind.”

She frowned. “You okay?”

“No,” I whispered. “I think I lost my best friend.”

She studied me, then said, “I’m Mariah. We’re in the same class, right? You’re Jessa. Jackson’s twin.”

“Yeah.”

“What movie are you supposed to be seeing?”

“Some superhero thing.”

Mariah smirked. “Ditch it. Come with me instead. There’s a new comedy. Way cuter lead actor.”

Before I could decide, Jackson and Noah appeared.

“Jess, what’s taking so long?” Jackson demanded. “Oh, hey, Mariah.”

Mariah smiled sweetly. “Hi. Jessa and I are seeing the comedy instead.”

Jackson shrugged. “Fine. Meet us in the lobby after.”

As he and Noah disappeared, Mariah tugged me toward her theater.

“Come on. You need a laugh.”

I glanced back one last time at my brother’s retreating figure.

He stole my best friend, I thought. And he’s never giving him back.

Three Years Later

Thirteen hit me hard. My body changed in ways I didn’t ask for. I wasn’t the chubby little girl anymore—I had curves. Breasts too big for my age. Hips that didn’t match the other girls at school.

Mom always said, Girls built like us need to cover up. Layers make you look thinner.

So I wore baggy shirts. Oversized hoodies. Clothes that swallowed me whole. It didn’t matter. The teasing still came.

“Jess, you’re wearing that?” Jackson asked one morning, eyeing my loose shirt.

“It’s comfortable.”

“It’s a tent.” He rolled his eyes and left.

Mom kissed my cheek. “Ignore him. He doesn’t understand what it’s like for girls like us.”

At school, the comments started before I even reached the doors.

“The circus is in town!”

“Yeah, they brought the whale exhibit!”

My stomach dropped when I saw where it came from—Jackson and Noah, flanked by their football buddies, all laughing.

“Nice shirt, Jess,” Noah snorted. “They only had tent size left?”

“Shut up, Noah.”

Jackson smirked. “Told you it was too big.”

“Perfect for hiding that fat ass,” Noah added, sending the group into hysterics.

I turned away, pretending I couldn’t hear. But their laughter followed me.

By the time I reached my locker, my hands were shaking. I tugged the handle, but it was jammed. Mariah appeared at my side.

“Need help?”

We pulled together until it finally burst open—and trash bags tumbled out, spilling all over the hallway.

A note taped to one read: Got you a new wardrobe.

The roar of laughter around us was deafening.

“Did you do this?” Mariah snapped at Jackson and Noah, who had pushed through the crowd to watch.

Noah grinned. “She wants to dress like a hobo? Why not just give her options?”

Jackson chuckled. “Relax. It’s just a joke.”

Mariah glared at him. “She’s your sister.”

But Jackson only walked away with Noah.

I stared at the trash bag in my hands. For just one second, I wished I could trade places. To be the one laughing, not the one humiliated.

Present Day

Beep. Beep. Beep.

I groaned, slamming my alarm clock. Senior year. My last year in this hellhole.

I’m Jessa. Nobody special. Just the overweight twin sister of Jackson, starting quarterback and golden boy of our high school. The sister his best friend, Noah Carter, has made it his life’s mission to torment.

Once, when I was ten, I thought Noah was cute. That crush didn’t survive the year. Now at eighteen, he’s tall, broad-shouldered, perfect hair, perfect smile. Every girl wants him.

And I can’t stand him.

But he’s always around—because he’s Jackson’s best friend. The boy who stole my brother from me.

I roll out of bed and tug on my armor: jeans, tank top, oversized button-up. The layers hide the body I’ve been told to be ashamed of.

Time to sneak out before Jackson sees me. Before Noah’s voice finds me.

Another day. Another battle.

# Chapter 2

Jessa

I tiptoe down the hallway, holding my breath. If Jackson’s awake, he’ll have some comment locked and loaded about my clothes, my hair, or just… me. I’d rather start the day without it.

Too late. His bedroom door creaks open, and there he is—my twin, my other half, my betrayer—all six feet of cocky quarterback standing in my way.

“Morning, Jess,” he says, eyes flicking over my shirt. “Nice… tent.”

I don’t even answer. I just shoulder past him, my cheeks heating.

“Aw, come on, don’t be so sensitive,” he calls after me.

Sensitive. That’s what he calls me when his words cut deep, like it’s my fault for feeling anything.

By the time I make it to the kitchen, Mom’s already gone. She leaves early most mornings, and I can’t decide if I’m grateful or jealous. Grateful that she doesn’t see me like this, jealous that she never has time for us.

Jackson grabs a protein shake from the fridge and downs it like he’s in some athlete commercial. I butter a piece of toast, trying to look invisible.

And then, of course, the devil himself arrives.

Noah Carter.

He strolls right into our kitchen like he owns it, helmet tucked under his arm, hair still damp from his shower, all six-foot-two of golden-boy arrogance. He’s wearing his jersey, number 14, stretched across broad shoulders like it was custom made for him.

And because I’m apparently a glutton for punishment, my stupid brain notices the curve of his jaw, the way his damp hair curls at the edges, the clean soap-and-sweat smell that clings to him. I hate myself for noticing.

“Morning, sunshine,” he smirks at me.

I roll my eyes. “Don’t call me that.”

“What? Thought you’d like a nickname.” His grin widens, like he knows exactly how to get under my skin.

Jackson laughs and bumps fists with him. “Ignore her, bro. Ready for practice?”

“Always,” Noah says. He glances at my toast, eyebrows lifting. “Extra butter again?”

I slam the knife down. “Seriously? Do you ever get tired of commenting on what I eat?”

Jackson snorts. “Don’t mind him, Jess.”

But I mind. God, I mind so much.

The two of them head out to the truck, leaving me with a cold piece of toast and the familiar ache in my chest. It’s the same ache I’ve had since I was ten years old.

The ache of realizing my twin—my best friend—chose someone else.

At school, it doesn’t get better. It never does.

The minute I step into the hallway, eyes flick my way. Whispers. Snickers. The same crap I’ve been hearing since middle school.

“Damn, she’s bigger than the linebackers.”

“Bet she eats more than the team.”

I keep walking, head down, pretending the words don’t stab me. But they do. Every single one leaves another scar I can’t cover with oversized clothes.

Jackson doesn’t notice, or maybe he does and just doesn’t care. He’s too busy soaking in the glory of being the starting quarterback. Too busy laughing with Noah and the rest of the team.

Noah. Always Noah.

The worst part is that when he laughs, it’s this deep, warm sound that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. When he smiles, girls melt into puddles. And when his hazel eyes catch the light, they almost glow.

I hate that I’ve noticed all of that.

I hate that part of me gets why the entire female population of Crestwood High would kill for a chance with him.

I hate that part of me, some twisted little part buried deep down, remembers what it felt like to have a crush on him before he turned into my tormentor.

Mariah finds me by my locker. Thank God for her. She’s the one good thing that came out of all this—the girl who saw me breaking at the movies three years ago and decided not to let me stand alone.

“You look like you’re ready to murder someone,” she says, tucking a strand of her blonde hair behind her ear.

“Noah,” I mutter. “As usual.”

She makes a face. “Ugh. You’d think after all these years he’d get bored.”

“He doesn’t. It’s like tormenting me is his favorite sport, right after football.”

Mariah sighs. “Well, senior year, right? Almost done.”

Almost. But almost feels like forever.

Lunch is the worst. Always has been.

I sit with Mariah at the edge of the cafeteria, away from the football table. But no matter how far away I am, Noah still finds me with his eyes. I feel them, sharp as daggers, hot as a spotlight.

Today’s no different. I’m halfway through my sandwich when I hear him across the room.

“Hey, Jackson! Better hide your food or Jess will eat it all before you blink.”

Laughter erupts from the table. Jackson doesn’t defend me. He never does.

I keep my head down, cheeks burning, praying no one else joins in. But of course they do.

“She could be the team mascot,” someone says. “Put her in pads, she’ll bulldoze the defense!”

The guys howl with laughter.

Mariah leans across the table, her eyes flashing. “Ignore them. They’re idiots.”

But ignoring doesn’t make it stop.

I grip my sandwich so tightly my knuckles turn white. In my head, I imagine standing up, marching over there, and telling Noah exactly what he is—a bully. A coward. A pathetic jerk who gets off on tearing me down.

But I don’t move.

Because I know what would happen if I did. He’d smirk. He’d say something sharper. And Jackson would laugh right alongside him.

Just like always.

That night, lying in bed, I stare at the ceiling.

This is my last year. One more year of Noah Carter. One more year of Jackson pretending I don’t exist except when it’s convenient. One more year of being “the fat twin,” the joke, the nobody.

After graduation, I’ll be free. College will be my reset button. Nobody will know me as Jackson’s sister or Noah’s favorite target. Nobody will remember the locker full of trash bags or the jokes about butter.

It’ll just be me.

But even as I tell myself that, my brain betrays me. Because it’s not Noah’s insults that replay behind my eyes. It’s his face. His stupidly perfect, sharp-jawed, broad-shouldered, movie-star face.

And I hate myself for it.

The next morning, the cycle repeats. Jackson teasing, Mom absent, me shrinking into myself.

But when Noah shows up, there’s a shift. Not big, not obvious—just a flicker.

He catches me staring.

I don’t mean to. Honest. I’m just zoning out, and my gaze lands on him, on the way his T-shirt stretches across his chest, on the strong line of his throat as he tilts his head back to laugh at something Jackson says.

And then his hazel eyes lock on mine.

For a second, I can’t breathe.

There’s no smirk, no insult, no sharp edge. Just Noah looking at me like… like he sees me.

Then he blinks, and it’s gone. Replaced by the same cocky grin I know too well.

“Like what you see, Sunshine?”

My face burns. “In your dreams.”

But that flicker stays with me all day.

And it terrifies me more than all his insults combined. Because what if—just what if—the boy who’s made my life hell for years is the one I can’t stop noticing?

What if the one I hate most is the one I’m secretly drawn to? And what if he knows it?

# Chapter 3

Noah

Most people think I’ve got it easy.

They see the jersey, the captain’s armband, the girls who slide notes into my locker, the teachers who cut me slack because I’m “leading the team this season.” They see the highlight reels, the touchdowns, the swagger.

And yeah, I play into it. Why wouldn’t I? That image has kept me on top since freshman year.

But what they don’t see—the part I’d never admit out loud—is that the best part of my day isn’t the touchdowns. It’s not the cheers, or even the wins.

It’s Jessa Lombardi’s face when I get under her skin.

I shouldn’t find it that entertaining. She’s Jackson’s twin, for one. Which means technically, she’s off-limits. But God, she makes it too easy. The way her cheeks flush, the way she slams things down or throws out these sharp little comebacks—Jessa’s like one giant exposed nerve. Sensitive as hell.

And I like testing how far I can push before she snaps.

Take this morning, for example.

Jackson and I were heading to practice, but I swung by his place first. Walking into their kitchen always feels… weird. I don’t know why. Maybe because I can practically feel how much Jessa doesn’t want me there.

She was standing at the counter, spreading butter on toast like it had personally offended her. Oversized T-shirt, messy hair, bare feet curling against the tile. For a second, I almost didn’t say anything.

Almost.

“Morning, sunshine,” I tossed out, leaning in the doorway.

The way her shoulders stiffened—it was instant gratification. Like watching a fire catch.

“Don’t call me that,” she muttered, eyes on her plate.

“What? Thought you’d like a nickname.”

She rolled her eyes so hard I swear I heard them click.

Jackson laughed, completely oblivious. “Ignore her, bro.”

I didn’t ignore her, of course. Couldn’t. I never do. Instead, I spotted the toast and couldn’t resist. “Extra butter again?”

She slammed the knife down like she wanted to stab me with it.

“Seriously? Do you ever get tired of commenting on what I eat?”

And just like that, my day was made. That flare of anger in her eyes, the way her voice cracked on ever. She didn’t realize it, but she was giving me exactly what I wanted.

Attention.

Here’s the thing: Jessa doesn’t understand me. She thinks I pick on her just to be a jerk, or because I’ve got nothing better to do. But the truth? It’s not that simple.

I notice her.

More than I should.

And noticing her—really noticing her—is dangerous.

Because Jessa’s not like the other girls who throw themselves at me. She doesn’t giggle when I walk by or bat her lashes hoping I’ll toss her a grin. She doesn’t want anything from me.

Except maybe for me to disappear.

And that makes me want to poke, prod, irritate. It makes me want her to look at me, even if it’s with fire in her eyes. Because when she’s angry at me, at least she’s seeing me.

At school, it’s even better.

In the cafeteria, Jackson and I had the whole team cracking up over stupid inside jokes when I spotted her sitting with Mariah. Always the far table, always head down, like she’s hoping to disappear.

But I don’t let her disappear.

“Hey, Jackson!” I yelled across the room. “Better hide your food or Jess will eat it all before you blink.”

The table erupted. Perfect.

I caught the way her shoulders hunched, the way her hand froze halfway to her mouth. She didn’t look up, but I knew she heard me. Knew she felt the sting.

And yeah, maybe that makes me an asshole. But there’s something about her silence that gets to me. Like she’s holding all this emotion inside, and I’m the only one who knows how to drag it out of her.

Jackson doesn’t get it. To him, Jessa’s just… Jessa. His twin, his shadow, the sister he doesn’t think twice about. He doesn’t notice the way she winces when people whisper, or the way she pulls her hoodie tighter like armor.

But I do.

I see it.

And sometimes I wonder if that’s why I keep poking—because if I don’t, maybe no one would notice her at all.

Practice that afternoon should’ve wiped Jessa from my brain. It usually does. Once I’m on the field, nothing else matters. The snap of the ball, the crunch of pads, the roar of the guys—it drowns everything out.

But not today.

Today, when I closed my eyes, all I saw was the way she glared at me over her toast, cheeks flushed, eyes flashing.

And then—God help me—the way her gaze flickered over me. She thought she was subtle, but I caught it. The way her eyes lingered on my shoulders, my chest.

She thinks I don’t notice, but I do.

And that thought sticks with me longer than I’d like.

That night, lying in bed, I try to tell myself it’s nothing. Jessa’s sensitive, that’s all. She reacts to me because I push her buttons. If she didn’t, I’d probably lose interest.

Except… I’m not losing interest.

If anything, I’m hooked.

I want to know how far I can push before she finally snaps. Before she lets me see the fire I know she’s hiding.

I want to know if that fire burns as hot when it’s not anger.

The next morning, I catch her staring again.

She doesn’t realize it—I’m laughing at something Jackson said, tilting my head back, and when I glance over, her eyes are on me. Not in hate. Not in anger. Just… watching.

And for one insane second, it feels like she sees me. Not the quarterback. Not Jackson’s best friend. Not the jerk who won’t leave her alone.

Just me.

Our eyes lock, and the air shifts. She looks caught, like a deer in headlights.

For once, I don’t smirk. For once, I just look back.

But then panic kicks in, and I cover it with a grin. “Like what you see, Sunshine?”

Her face flames. “In your dreams.”

But I heard the hitch in her breath. I saw the way she couldn’t look away fast enough.

And that’s when I know I’m in trouble.

Because tormenting Jessa Lombardi isn’t just a game anymore.

It’s an addiction.

And sooner or later, it’s going to blow up in my face.

# Chapter 4

Noah

The problem with lying to yourself is that eventually, the truth claws its way out.

I’ve been telling myself for years that I bug Jessa because it’s easy. Because she’s reactive, and I like the way she gets flustered. That’s it. Simple.

But it’s not.

If I’m honest—and I almost never am, even in my own head—it started way before she became “sensitive Jessa.”

It started in middle school.

Back then, Jessa was different. Not unrecognizable—she still had the dark eyes, the messy hair, the sharp tongue—but she laughed more. She’d shoot water through her teeth at Jackson during lunch, or race us to the corner store after practice and somehow always win, even though her legs were half the size of ours.

She wasn’t invisible back then. She didn’t try to be.

I noticed her before I even realized I was noticing her. The way her grin curved higher on the right side. The way she’d wrinkle her nose when she concentrated. The way she never backed down, even when she should have.

I liked it.

Too much.

And that scared the hell out of me.

Because she was Jackson’s twin. And Jackson’s my guy—my quarterback, my brother from another mother. There’s an unspoken rule: sisters are off-limits. Period.

So instead of admitting I was drawn to her, I started pushing her away. Teasing, needling, whatever you want to call it. It was easier to play the jerk than to let anyone—including her—guess how I actually felt.

And over the years, that mask stuck.

Now everyone, including Jessa, believes I really am that guy. The one who points out her extra butter, or makes cracks in the cafeteria.

But underneath it? Every time I say something, every time I watch her react, there’s this other layer.

I’m watching her mouth.

I’m watching her eyes.

I’m thinking things I shouldn’t think.

Last week was the worst.

We were at Jackson’s, sprawled on the couch, watching film. Jessa came in with a bowl of popcorn, pretending she didn’t care if we ate it all. She sat on the floor, leaning against the coffee table, hoodie sleeves covering her hands.

And when she laughed—actually laughed at some dumb commentary on TV—it hit me like a helmet to the ribs.

I hadn’t heard that laugh in a long time.

It wasn’t sharp or defensive. It wasn’t trying to hide. It was just… real.

I couldn’t stop staring.

And then she glanced up, caught me looking, and everything inside me knotted tight. Because for a second, I swear she knew.

Knew that I’d been watching her.

Knew that maybe, underneath all the teasing, I wanted her.

The worst part?

I don’t want to stop.

I tell myself I should. That she deserves better than being some secret I bury under sarcasm. That Jackson would kill me if he knew.

But then she glares at me across the table, or snaps back with some fiery retort, and it’s like gasoline on a match. I can’t quit.

It’s like the closer I get to the edge, the more I want to see what happens if I jump.

What happens if I stop hiding behind jokes and just say it.

That I like the way she looks in oversized T-shirts. That I notice how she tucks her hair behind her ear when she’s nervous. That I’ve thought about what her mouth would feel like against mine more times than I can admit.

That the reason I agitate her isn’t because she’s sensitive.

It’s because she makes me feel exposed.

And the only way I know how to handle it is to make her feel the same.

Lying here now, staring at the ceiling in the dark, I know I’m screwed.

Because sooner or later, I won’t be able to keep pretending.

And when that happens, everything—my friendship with Jackson, the team, the fragile balance we’ve all built—could go up in flames.

But the truth?

If it means Jessa finally sees me the way I see her…

I might just light the match myself.

I'm starting a similar website!,"I know many of us miss that sweet, sweet dopamine hit you'd get from opening the legendary Missoula Mugs page and seeing all the guilty people on there. I know I used to start my mornings with coffee, a pre-roll, and Missoula Mugs. I even had my ""favorites"", repeat offenders I would see time and time again until they began to feel like the family I never had.

Unfortunately the page was taken down, robbing the community of an invaluable tool to feel superior to others while killing time. So I've come up with an idea!

I plan to start my own similar website: Mugs of Missoula.

My idea is to hang out in front of the jail with a camera with a nice lens and take pictures of criminals as they are led from the police car to the booking area. I would take note of the time and use the booking time on the official jail roster to correlate names. 

Of course I would sell ad space on the site; servers and domain names aren't free. Plus profiting off of others' misfortune is a distinctly American trait. 

I'm even thinking of starting an ""unrelated"" (wink wink) Facebook page where we can crack jokes and spread rumors about the people on my site! This will drive engagement and foster a sense of community.

Who's with me?! Let's bring back the glory days and get Mugs of Missoula up and running. DM me for my venmo/cashapp if you want to help out. ",1,1762409376.0,missoula,0,0.6,False

It's a quiet Tuesday morning. You're sipping your coffee, feeling like you've finally got this parenting thing under control. Then, you hear it. The *thump-scramble-splash* from the playroom.

Your heart sinks. You know exactly what it is: the ""grape juice incident."" In the past, this meant frantically scrubbing a stain that would become a permanent, purple monument to your morning. But not anymore. Because you invested in a **washable area rug**.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=kids%20room%20washable%20area%20rugs)

Welcome to the world of stress-free parenting, where messes are temporary and clean floors are just a wash cycle away. This is your complete guide to finding, buying, and caring for the best kids room washable area rugs.

## The Game-Changing Benefits of Washable Rugs

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=kids%20room%20washable%20area%20rugs)

If you're still on the fence, let's talk about why these rugs aren't just a luxury—they're a necessity for any home with children.

*   **Effortless Cleanup:** From spilled juice and muddy footprints to craft glue and pet accidents, everything is manageable. Just toss the rug in the wash. That's it.
*   **Superior Hygiene:** Standard rugs are breeding grounds for dust mites, allergens, and bacteria. Regularly washing your child's rug creates a healthier environment, which is especially important for kids with allergies or asthma.
*   **Incredible Durability & Cost-Effectiveness:** Think about how many cheap rugs you've thrown away because of a single, permanent stain. Washable rugs are designed to last, saving you money in the long run.
*   **Ultimate Peace of Mind:** This is the biggest one. You can actually *relax*. Let your kids play, create, and be kids without turning into a ""don't-spill-that"" monster. It's an investment in your sanity.

## Your Shopping Checklist: Features to Look For

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=kids%20room%20washable%20area%20rugs)

Ready to shop? Not so fast. Not all washable rugs are created equal. Keep this checklist handy to find the perfect one for your space.

### **Material Matters: Soft, Safe, and Strong**

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=kids%20room%20washable%20area%20rugs)

The feel of the rug is important—it's a play surface, after all! Look for kid-friendly materials that are both soft and durable.

*   **Chenille:** Incredibly soft and plush, like a giant blanket for the floor.
*   **Cotton:** Lightweight, breathable, and often gets softer with every wash.
*   **Microfiber:** Great for trapping dust and is very easy to clean.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=kids%20room%20washable%20area%20rugs)

***Pro-Tip:** Always check for **non-toxic dyes** and certifications like OEKO-TEX, which ensures the textile is free from harmful substances.*

### **Not All ""Washable"" Are Equal**

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=kids%20room%20washable%20area%20rugs)

This is the most crucial feature. Before you click ""add to cart,"" verify the washing instructions.

*   **Machine Washable:** The gold standard. Look for rugs specifically designed to fit in a standard home washing machine.
*   **Size Matters:** A 9'x12' rug might be washable, but not in your home machine. Many larger washable rugs are designed in two pieces that can be washed separately.
*   **Spot Clean Only:** Avoid this for kids' rooms. You want full machine-wash capability.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=kids%20room%20washable%20area%20rugs)

### **Non-Slip Backing is Non-Negotiable**

Safety first! A rug that bunches up and slides is a trip hazard. Look for rugs with a durable, non-slip rubber or latex backing. This ensures the rug stays put, even during the most intense indoor fort-building sessions.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=kids%20room%20washable%20area%20rugs)

### **Style & Design: Let Their Personality Shine**

A rug is the centerpiece of a room. The beauty of modern washable rugs is that they don't sacrifice style for function.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=kids%20room%20washable%20area%20rugs)

*   **For a Nursery:** Think soft, neutral colors, subtle patterns, or whimsical animal prints.
*   **For a Playroom:** Go bold! Bright colors, fun patterns, or even interactive, educational designs like maps or alphabet rugs are perfect.
*   **For a Big Kid's Room:** Consider their interests. Geometric patterns, space themes, or sophisticated boho styles can help their room ""grow up"" with them.

## Keeping It Fresh: A Simple Washing Guide

You've got the rug home. A spill happens. Now what? Don't panic. Follow these simple steps to keep your rug looking brand new.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=kids%20room%20washable%20area%20rugs)

1.  **Check the Label:** This is rule #1. The manufacturer knows best. Follow their specific temperature and cycle recommendations.
2.  **Shake It Out:** Before washing, take the rug outside and give it a good shake to remove loose dirt, dust, and Lego pieces.
3.  **Pre-Treat Stains:** For tough, set-in stains, use a gentle, kid-friendly stain remover. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes before washing.
4.  **Wash with Care:** Use a **gentle cycle** with **cold water**. Hot water can cause shrinkage or fading. Avoid harsh detergents—a mild one is all you need.
5.  **Dry Smart:** The best method is to **air dry**. Hang it over a railing or lay it flat. If you must use a dryer, use the **lowest heat or no-heat tumble setting**. High heat can damage the fibers and backing.

Our friendship chemistry is strong and all 3 of us hang out together nearly every day. 

Over the course of several weeks I've begun to develop feelings for one of two. I want to get to know her on a more personal level but since the three of us have become accustomed with hanging out together, I don't want to exclude or risk alienating her twin in any way. It feels weird to only invite one for a coffee, when we have a strong precedent for doing things together as a trio.

A few additional things to note:

* As ironic as it sounds, although I want connect romantically with one sister, I've observed myself experiencing greater difficulty comprehending her when her twin is absent, in the few instances we've been alone. As in, when the twin who I'm *not interested in* is present, she frequently acts as a mouthpiece or helps clarify the ideas, thoughts, feelings, etc. of the twin *I am interested in*. 
* I'm assuming that singling out one sister for a coffee date would automatically upset her twin. Perhaps this is totally unfounded, e.g. ""If one twin reciprocates my feelings, *it's plausible that her sister would like me too.*""  
* To what extent can either twin sense whether her sibling is interested in someone? Would the twin typically discover this by some unique unspoken ""twin intuition"", or through explicit disclosure?",0,1762409183.0,Twins,1,0.5,False

I Tried the *Fit To Be Pregnant Plan* for 30 Days — and honestly, my energy levels tripled. Not “marketing fluff” tripled — I mean, *I stopped needing my afternoon nap and that extra coffee that I swore was “non-negotiable.”* ☕💪  

I went into this experiment out of sheer curiosity. I’m not pregnant (and no, you don’t have to be), but the plan got a lot of buzz for being *nutrition-smart*, *hormone-friendly*, and totally digital-friendly. I thought: *“Why not see if this helps with my constant energy crashes?”*  

Spoiler: It did. And here’s what really made the difference 👇  

---

- ✅ **Digital-first convenience:** No awkward gym memberships, just a full online plan I could access on my own time — and yes, it works great on mobile.  
- 🥗 **Nutrition shifts that actually made sense:** Instead of restrictive diets, it focused on smart fueling. Within 10 days, I felt noticeably lighter — not thinner yet, but *lighter.*  
- 💬 **Built-in accountability:** The app’s daily tracker quietly bullied encouraged me to stick to my habits (and it worked).  
- 🌙 **Real rest:** My sleep quality improved so much I felt like I was charging in “fast mode.”  
- ❤️ **Emotional wellbeing:** The plan surprisingly emphasized mood balance — turns out, managing cortisol and nourishment does more for calm than any “breathe app.”  

---

I wasn’t expecting my energy to skyrocket, but after the first two weeks, I could *feel* the shift. You know that feeling when your mind is alert but relaxed? That’s where I stayed all day. I even caught myself dancing while vacuuming (which my partner confirmed was both concerning and kind of delightful).  

If you’ve been skeptical about wellness ebooks or programs that promise miracles, I get it. I’ve tried plenty that fizzled out before the novelty did. But this one? Worth every click.  

Here’s the ebook I grabbed —

💡 **Key takeaway:** Investing in your energy is the best “digital deal” you can make. Turns out, online wellness can *actually deliver value* — when it’s built right.  

If your body’s been running on “low battery mode,” consider this your nudge to reboot it. Its simplicity is why I’ve already recommended it to three friends (and counting).

These ""informational interviews,"" often called coffee chats, are fantastic opportunities to learn directly from people who have experience you admire. Think of them as informal conversations aimed at gaining insights into different roles, career paths, and industry trends, rather than a direct job interview. The goal is to build genuine connections and expand your understanding of the professional landscape.

Diving into these chats helps you explore career possibilities you might not have considered, understand daily realities of certain jobs, and even learn specific skills or strategies that helped others succeed. By genuinely expressing interest and asking thoughtful questions about their experiences—like ""What surprised you most about your transition into X?"" instead of just ""How did you get into X?""—you gain valuable perspectives. This approach not only enriches your knowledge but also helps you clarify your own career aspirations.

To make the most of these opportunities, always research the person's background thoroughly before reaching out. Craft a brief, personalized message highlighting *why* you're interested in connecting with *them* specifically, perhaps mentioning a shared interest or a project they worked on. After a productive chat, a prompt thank-you note is essential. Staying connected over time by sharing relevant articles or updates can also keep the relationship alive and may even lead to unexpected opportunities down the line.",1,1762408862.0,Dust2Data,0,1.0,False

Next episode, please.","For six months, I let my fiancé and his family mock me in Arabic, thinking I was just a naive American girl who didn't understand. They had no idea I was fluent in Arabic! And they definitely had no idea I was recording every word to use against them...//...The sound of laughter echoed through the Damascus Rose Restaurant's private dining room, but I sat perfectly still, my fork hovering over the lamb. Around the table, 12 members of the Almanzor family gestured animatedly, their Arabic flowing like water, deliberately excluding me.

At the head of the table sat Tariq, my fiancé, his hand resting possessively on my shoulder, translating absolutely nothing. From across the table, his mother, Leila, watched me with sharp falcon eyes, a slight smile on her lips. She knew. They all knew.

Tariq leaned toward his younger brother, Omar, speaking in rapid Arabic, casual, as if I weren't there.

""She doesn't even know how to prepare proper coffee,"" Tariq said, his voice dripping with amusement. ""Yesterday she used a machine.""

""A machine?"" Omar snorted, nearly choking on his wine. ""Like we're at some American diner? Brother, what happened to your standards?""

I took a delicate sip of water, my face a careful mask of polite confusion. The same expression I'd perfected for six months. The same one I’d used for eight years in Dubai, where I learned that the most powerful position is the one where everyone underestimates you.

Tariq’s hand squeezed my shoulder. ""My mother was just saying how beautiful you look tonight, Habibti.""

I smiled back, soft and grateful. ""That's so sweet. Please tell her thank you.""

What Leila, his mother, had actually said, not thirty seconds ago, was that my dress was ""too tight and made me look cheap.""

Tariq's sister, Amira, muttered just loud enough for the family. ""She can't even speak our language, knows nothing about our culture. What kind of wife will she make?""

""The kind who doesn't know when she's being insulted,"" Tariq replied smoothly, and the table erupted in laughter.

I laughed too. A small, uncertain sound. Inside, I was calculating. Documenting. Adding every word to the list.

My phone buzzed in my clutch. I excused myself and locked myself in the marble restroom. The message was from James Chen, my father’s head of security.

‘Documentation uploaded. Audio from the last three family dinners successfully transcribed. Your father wants to know if you're ready to proceed.’

I typed back quickly. ‘Not yet. He needs to incriminate himself professionally, not just personally.’

I deleted the conversation, refreshed my lipstick, and walked back to the table. Tariq's father, Hassan, was raising his glass for a toast, speaking entirely in Arabic.

""To my son's clever match,"" he announced. ""May he extract every advantage from this alliance, and may the American girl remain blissfully ignorant of her purpose.""

""My father wishes us happiness and prosperity,"" Tariq translated smoothly.

""That's beautiful,"" I murmured, raising my glass and meeting his eyes. They all believed I was the lamb being led to slaughter. They had no idea I was the one setting the trap...

I have a silly question, mostly because of my curiosity.  
  
I was really excited when Satisfactory announced the console version. I don't even have a console but was happy that Coffee Stain was doing it.  
  
This means a new wave of revenue that I honestly think they deserve. And with more revenue, they can continue working and improving the game. Let's admit, Satisfactory is a cheap game that took around 9 years to develop. I honestly don't know how they pulled it off.

Do we have sale data anywhere? Did the console release do well? Reading posts over here it seems like it did, but that's not a reliable source of data. I really want this to be a huge success. ",1,1762407890.0,SatisfactoryGame,3,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------------------

Are you intrigued by the idea of a mini barndominium? This unique blend of barn and condominium design offers a modern lifestyle with rustic charm. Let's explore innovative floor plans and ideas that can transform these spaces into comfortable and stylish homes.

### Understanding the Mini Barndominium Concept

A mini barndominium is not just about aesthetics; it’s about functionality. These structures often feature open floor plans, maximizing available space and making them feel larger than they are. By incorporating elements like high ceilings and large windows, you can create an airy environment that welcomes natural light.

### Creative Floor Plans to Consider

When designing your mini barndominium, consider various floor plan options that suit your lifestyle.

- **Open Concept Living:** This layout merges the kitchen, dining, and living areas into one expansive space. It’s perfect for entertaining and family gatherings, as it encourages interaction.
- **Two-Bedroom Floor Plans:** If you want extra room for guests or a home office, a two-bedroom configuration can be highly versatile. This design often places both bedrooms at opposite ends of the unit, allowing for privacy.
- **Split-Level Designs:** A split-level mini barndominium provides distinct living areas on different floors, which can enhance functionality. Bedrooms can occupy one level, while the common areas are on another, offering separation for peace and quiet.
- **Multi-Purpose Spaces:** Consider integrating multi-purpose rooms that can be transformed into guest rooms or offices as needed. This flexibility makes your home adaptable as your needs change.

### Design Ideas That Reflect Modern Living

The beauty of a mini barndominium lies in its ability to incorporate modern design trends while maintaining its rustic roots. Here are some creative ideas to bring your mini barndominium to life:

- **Rustic Yet Modern Kitchen:** Opt for sleek appliances and a large island, paired with wooden accents and open shelving. This blend creates a space that's both functional and inviting.
- **Natural Light with Large Windows:** Installing large windows can significantly brighten the interior and connect you with the outside. Consider adding sliding doors that open directly to a porch or deck, enhancing your living space.
- **Sustainable Materials:** Think about using eco-friendly materials such as reclaimed wood, bamboo flooring, and energy-efficient appliances. This choice not only contributes to a healthier environment but also showcases your commitment to sustainability.

### Maximizing Outdoor Living

Outdoor spaces can elevate your living experience. Here are some ideas for optimizing your mini barndominium's exterior:

- **Covered Porches:** A wraparound porch can serve as an outdoor living area, perfect for gatherings or relaxing with a book.
- **Outdoor Kitchen/Grill Area:** Extension of your kitchen outside encourages alfresco dining and entertaining throughout the warmer months.
- **Garden Space:** Utilize your surrounding land for gardening or landscaping. It can be both a functional and beautiful addition to your property.

### Choosing the Right Interior Style

Consider how you want your interior to reflect your taste. The beauty of mini barndominiums is their adaptability to various decorating styles:

- **Cottage Style:** Use pastel colors, floral patterns, and rustic furnishings to create a cozy atmosphere.
- **Industrial Style:** Embrace raw materials like exposed brick, steel fixtures, and minimalist décor for a chic and urban feel.
- **Modern Farmhouse:** This style merges contemporary elements with classic rustic features, like shiplap walls and vintage light fixtures.

With these innovative floor plans and design ideas, your mini barndominium can become a stylish haven that meets the demands of modern living. Dive into this exciting journey of creating a space that blends comfort, convenience, and charm.

Creative Ideas for Decorating and Maximizing Small Barndominiums
----------------------------------------------------------------

Turning your small barndominium into a cozy and functional space hinges on clever decorating and maximizing the square footage you have available. With the right creative ideas, you can transform a compact area into a stylish and efficient home. Whether you're starting from scratch or looking to refresh your current setup, consider these innovative strategies.

### Opt for Multi-Functional Furniture

When space is limited, every piece of furniture should serve multiple purposes. Look for items that can be easily transformed for different uses. Here are some options:

- **Sofa Beds:** Perfect for living rooms or studio setups, they provide seating by day and a bed by night.
- **Storage Ottomans:** Use these for additional seating or foot support, while also saving space by storing blankets or books inside.
- **Extendable Dining Tables:** A table that can shrink or expand as needed is ideal for small gatherings without taking up too much space when not in use.

### Incorporate Vertical Space

Utilize the vertical space in your barndominium to create more room and keep things organized. Here’s how you can achieve that:

- **Shelves:** Install floating shelves to display decor, books, and plants without occupying floor space.
- **Wall Hooks:** Use artistic hooks to hang coats, hats, or even decorative items, saving valuable closet space.
- **High Cabinets:** Reach for the top! Tall cabinets can store items out of sight, while keeping your floor area uncluttered.

### Embrace Light Colors and Natural Materials

The color palette in your barndominium affects both the visual space and ambiance. Opt for light colors to create an open feel:

- **Neutral Tones:** Shades of white, beige, and light grays can make a room feel larger and more airy.
- **Pops of Color:** Incorporate small accents such as cushions or art pieces to add personality without overwhelming the space.
- **Natural Elements:** Use wood, stone, or metal to bring warmth and texture, which can make even the smallest areas feel inviting.

### Use Mirrors Wisely

Mirrors are a fantastic tool for making small spaces feel larger. Here are some tips on placement:

- **Opposite Windows:** Place a mirror across from a window to reflect light and create an illusion of depth.
- **Mirrored Furniture:** Consider incorporating items like a mirrored coffee table to add sophistication while also reflecting light.
- **Gallery Walls:** Create an artistic feature by using different sizes and styles of mirrors to decorate a wall.

### Maximize Outdoor Spaces

Don't forget about your outdoor area! Expanding your living space outdoors can significantly enhance your barndominium experience:

- **Patios and Decks:** Create a welcoming area to relax and entertain. Furniture such as compact outdoor sets can work wonders.
- **Vertical Gardens:** If space allows, a vertical garden or pot rack for herbs can make your outdoor area more functional.
- **Lighting:** Use string lights or solar lanterns to create a cozy atmosphere that extends your living space into the evening hours.

### Personal Touches

Personalize your barndominium to reflect your style. The little touches you add will make it feel like home. Consider:

- **Artwork:** Hang unique pieces that speak to you. This adds color and character to your walls.
- **Family Photos:** Create a gallery wall of family memories to infuse warmth and love into your space.
- **DIY Projects:** Incorporate handmade items that showcase your creativity and make the space feel uniquely yours.

By focusing on these creative ideas for decorating and maximizing your small barndominium, you'll not only enhance its functionality but also create a space that feels warm and inviting. Make the most of every square inch, and let your personality shine through in your design choices. Remember, it’s all about making your cozy home reflect your style while being practical enough to meet your everyday needs.

### Conclusion

Embracing the charm and functionality of mini barndominiums, you can transform your living space into a cozy retreat that reflects your unique style. The innovative floor plans available today offer a fantastic blend of modern design and practical use, making these small homes ideal for anyone looking to maximize their living area without sacrificing comfort. From open-concept layouts that encourage social interaction to clever storage solutions that keep your essentials organized, the possibilities are endless.

When it comes to decorating your mini barndominium, creativity is key. Using multi-functional furniture and smart design choices allows you to make the most of every square foot. Think about incorporating flexible spaces that can adapt to your needs, whether it's a home office, a guest room, or a hobby area. Furthermore, you can infuse personality into your space by selecting a color palette that feels inviting and incorporating decor elements that showcase your interests.

By thoughtfully considering both the layout and aesthetic of your mini barndominium, you create a living space that is not only practical but also truly feels like home. With the right floor plan and creative decorating ideas, a mini barndominium can be a perfect answer for modern living. So, as you embark on your barndominium journey, remember that every small detail plays a significant role in crafting a beautiful and functional home tailored just for you.

**Context:**

I (18F) moved from a small country town 10 months ago with my childhood friend of around 16 years, Sam (19F) for university. I am studying nursing and Sam is studying Law. 

Sam and I were thinking about moving in together before we even left our home town but due to the cost of living in Australia, we decided it would be a better idea if we had a third roommate (a mutual family friend owns an apartment that was going to be vacant when we moved but it was 3 bedroom 3 bathroom and expensive for just 2 people). Sam has distance family living in our university city but I did not so it didn't leave us with many optinions for roommates. We used Facebook and put posters up around campus looking for a potential roommate. 

This is when we met Zoe (20F). Zoe goes to the same university as Sam and I but is in her second year of her computer science degree. She used my phone number which was on the flyers posted around campus to contact me and say she was interested. 

All three of us met up for coffee and she seemed extremely nice. She talked about how much fun we would have and just seemed very enthusiastic. 

We decided that she was a good fit after sorting throughout some other applicants due to the fact she has a similar lifestyle to Sam and I (busy overworked uni students) and is around the same age as us. 

Zoe moved in and it was great for the first couple of months. She was clean, kind and made an effort to talk to Sam and I, planning little roommate activities in our apartment when our schedules aligned. 

**Where the problem started:** 

Eventually our schedules got more and more packed as the year went on. Since I am a nursing student, I am always either studying, in class, sorting out placement or working. I work as an assistant in nursing at an age care facility 10 minutes from where we live and am always picking up shifts whenever I can. Sam has also gotten extremely busy as well working and studying. 

 For more context her designated classrooms and building for her degree on campus was close to Sam's but all the way across campus to mine. 

She started showing up on my way to classes acting like we ran in to each other enough for me to start questioning why she was there, I saw her in my building a couple times but she did not come up to me but kept her distance (I don't think she would have any reason to come into my building at all). She started coming to my gym despite saying she hated working out. She joined a club that I was apart of acting like she didn't know I was in it when we went for a meeting. 

I asked her about why she was in my building and she said that she was looking for me so we could have lunch and that there was no-one else she could ask despite the fact she knew I had classes during lunch time and Sam did not and her building was closer. 

I swear a couple times I saw outside of my work (there is no way she could get into the building there are multiple codes and entrances for staff only and I typically work late so outside visiting hours). 

This has been going on for months, it started probably in April and it is currently November. 

This has not been the only things. My belonging are constantly going missing. We share a washing machine/dryer so sometimes are clothes get mixed up but we always give them back to each other. I have lost a countless amount of bras and underwear , a few tops and pants but more recently my work clothes and university scrubs. 

I can kinda understand my personal clothes despite the fact all of us are different sizes (I have a smaller bra and underwear size compared to Sam and Zoe to the point it is obvious as well as being a couple sizes smaller with general clothing). 

My work clothes and scrubs... I can not understand. 

As I mentioned I am the only person doing nursing and working in health care. My work uniform is a green and white stripped button up with black dress pants AND my name and work logo is embroidered into my shirt. 

My scrubs are fully purple with my degree on the front and 'STUDENT NURSE"" on the back. I don't know how anyone could possibly mix that up. I originally only has two pairs of nursing scrubs and had to order another couple work shirts. 

I asked Zoe and Sam of they knew where they had gone. Sam said no but said she would help me look but Zoe immediately said that I must've lost them. 

Other belongings such as my lip balms, pens, books, pencil cases, toiletries out of my bathroom have gone missing as well. I can explain pens and lip balms but one thing I can't explain is my journal...

I carry around a purple journal in my bag at all times. This has my WHOLE schedule planned out and I write in it quite often usually using it at least once a day. I went home briefly to change after classes on my way to work, leaving my bag on the kitchen table before I came back out of my room grabbing my bag and leaving. 

I did not see anyone in the apartment but when I got to work and tried checking something in my journal it was gone despite the fact I used it just before I left campus so probably an hour before I got home and changed and left again. 

I look everywhere thinking it slipped out of my bag but I swear I had it when I went to change. 

Zoe has started appearing more frequently now (I lost my journal about a month ago) She is now EVERYWHERE. 

I keep telling myself that I must be imaging things and no way I could be getting talked by my own roommate but I always feel like in am being watched or my belongings are going missing or something is misplaced in my room.

What should I do?? Our lease is ending in a month and I want to get away from Zoe...

I am planning on talking to Sam about this, I really just needed to gather my thoughts.

I feel like I cant accuse Zoe of anything without proof, I keep telling myself it's nothing. I think I am going crazy. 

Help please...

I also didn’t know if she was even into girls. HOWEVER the other day I saw her on a dating app that I use and I have a feeling that she saw me on there too. I didn’t swipe right of course but I think she saw me on there as well because recently she has been more smiley, maintaining more eye contact, and more talkative with me since I spotted her on the app. I also noticed she seems to be a bit giggle-y when talking to me but not when my coworkers take her order or talk to her.

But for the life of me I can’t figure out how I would furnish this living room. The closet door, radiator, and 3 doorways are positioned to where having a couch and a tv stand seem impossible unless I just have like 2-3 arm chairs and a coffee table set up.

1opqnlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1opqnlq/im_watching_my_dad_burn_down_a_40year_marriage/,I’m watching my dad burn down a 40-year marriage for nothing — and I don’t recognize him anymore.,"
I never thought I’d be here. My parents have been married for over 40 years. I grew up in a stable Catholic home — my mom led the PTA, my dad coached my soccer team, and we took family trips to Disney every year. They were the couple everyone looked up to.

I’m 32 and living with them right now because of a chronic illness that’s left me temporarily disabled. I’m in therapy to regain my independence, but in the meantime, I’m stuck watching this from the front row.

My dad has what he calls a “friendship” with a woman from his music group. She’s a widow, and they got close after her husband passed away. But it’s not friendship — it’s an emotional affair. Constant texts. Long phone calls. Secret meetups. Turning off his phone location.

This all came to light in June, but my mom and I have pieced together enough to believe it started months before — maybe even while the woman’s husband was still alive. That thought makes me sick. My dad used to be the kind of man who’d never blur those lines. I don’t know how to reconcile that with the version of him now.

He even told my mom it’s “either she stays in my life or there’s no marriage.” He swears nothing physical happened, but then says “God understands my heart.” As if that makes it okay. As if faith has become his shield against accountability.

My mom’s devastated. She’s been tracking his location, showing up where he goes, just trying to hang on. Last month, she started sleeping in the guest room upstairs. They’ve shared a bed for over 40 years. That’s when it really sank in — something sacred has cracked.

She even confronted both of them. She showed up during a four-hour “coffee outing” and sat down. The woman acted pious and calm, claiming they’re just “friends growing closer to God.” 

My dad came home from church one day saying, almost smugly, that “God is still on my side.” He told my mom he “stole the woman’s heart.” Then he looked at me and asked, “What is your mom really losing by me having this friend?”

What I can’t stop asking myself is: why is this random woman worth trading everything for?
A marriage. A family. His reputation. His faith. Forty years of connection. Why is she worth burning it all down?

He thinks he’s entitled to privacy — that as long as “nothing physical happened,” no one has the right to judge him. I told him the truth always comes out. Part of me wonders if putting this whole thing on blast would be the only way to wake him up.

They’ve started counseling, but even the therapist looked stunned. He referred them both out for individual sessions. Their new appointments are next week.

I don’t know what happens after that. Two of my three brothers know, but no one talks. The silence feels like mourning.

I’m trying to support my mom, but it’s draining. Every day feels heavier. And every time I look at my dad, I see someone I don’t recognize anymore.

Sometimes I just sit with the questions that keep me up at night:
Is the man I cherished as my dad still in there?
Will he ever snap out of this?
And if he doesn’t… how do I ever trust him again?
How do I trust any man again, after watching the best one I knew burn everything down for nothing?

TL;DR:
My 74-year-old dad is having an emotional affair with a widow from his music group. My 69-year-old mom knows, and it’s destroying her. He uses faith to justify it and refuses to cut contact. They’ve started marriage counseling, but the therapist immediately referred them to individual sessions. My mom recently moved into the guest room. I’m their 32-year-old daughter, currently living with them due to a chronic illness and disability, and I’m watching this unfold up close. I don’t know how to support my mom without losing my dad — or whether I should reach out to the other woman’s adult children, who already disapprove of the situation.",4,1762407138.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I've been under a lot of stress and anxious the past year or two, and have been having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. So, for most of the year I've been taking melatonin just to be able to fall asleep at reasonable hour.

  
I (usually) try to be in bed and asleep around 10pm, as I wake up around 6:00-6:20am (I can fall asleep at either 9pm or 3pm and still will naturally wake up at 6am). As you see it doesn't always happen. But I've noticed that even if I sleep longer with melatonin (as I'm falling asleep faster and earlier in the evening), my sleep quality is bad, I wake up a few times a nigh and generally feel... not rested.

  
Here's a screenshot of one of my ""good"" nights, overall consistent bed time, 2 coffees during the day, with last one before 2pm and a melatonin:

This is my sleep last night, on 3 coffees (which usually wrecks my sleep) as I was out on a concert the night before and went to bed at midnight, no melatonin, just a natural supplement for stress relief. Just one pee pause.

I moved to the city fairly recently and have always been very shy and awkward, and I have a hard time making friends. I’m also feeling very lost and lonely in the city, especially while going through the typical early 20s panic! 

My question is, where can I meet and chat with older folks? I’d really love to talk to someone with more experience in the world and hear their stories. I feel like it would really help ease some of my nerves about feeling lost as a young adult in the world! I love art and tea and coffee (even if my stomach doesn’t). I’ve looked on the meetup app, but I’m better 1:1 with people than showing up to a group event. Any tips? Thank you so much! 🙇‍♀️

1opqi07,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/1opqi07/how_do_you_all_deal_with_your_nursing_bullies/,How do you all deal with your nursing bullies?,"My cohort is a mess and there’s barely any cohesion between any of us. I would venture to say that there are people ready to tear each other down at a moments notice. No one is supportive of each other, everyone has to be THE BEST. It’s bad enough that if you speak to any Cohort above or below us, they’ve even heard just how bad our cohort is - whether from the rumor mill or from instructors themselves. 

I just didn’t realize that grown adults could be this… Vicious? It’s worse than Middle and High School combined. (Of note, I’m 29.)

There’s a specific group that’s primarily victims in the behavior - when it started back in Fundamentals, primary victims were those who had a history already in the medical field. Example: I spent multiple years as a CMA, as well as a few others who are victims of this behavior as well, who are now returning to school after years in other healthcare related positions. I could have rationalized it then as jealousy that we already knew some of the skills being taught. However, it’s continued term after term, weeks on weeks on weeks. 

It is just entirely “mean girl-esque” attitudes, and after a year of tolerating it, I’m getting so beyond burnt out. I’m so close to being done…. but then comes the fear of encountering it in the work force. 

So how do you deal with it? What’s the most appropriate course of action? Especially when you get out into the “real world.”

Examples of behavior:

- Someone they don’t like tries to ask a question? They’re sighing loudly in exasperation, “are you serious?,” “again?” or “oh my godddd.”

- Need instruction clarification? Someone is muttering: “Let’s just move on” or “next subject!”

- Teacher asks someone to explain their line of thought because they feel it’s a great way of rationalizing? They will hold their own side conversation as a point to not listen/talk over their peer.

- Group projects? Impossible to speak without having eyes rolled at you if you share your perspective or politely disagree (even if what you are saying is evidence based.)

- God FORBID you accidentally make a mistake or have a brain fart. As a personal example, my most recent was a lack of sleep during lecture and stating “antibiotics don’t treat bacteria” when I meant viruses. We are all seniors now. I had 3 hours of sleep and no coffee. If I’ve made it this far (A&P 1&2, Micro, Pharm, etc), I obviously know what antibiotics are for. I did not need 5+ people scrambling over each other at the opportunity to tear me down. 

There’s no room to fail in this cohort. It’s not even holding each other to higher standards and helping each other learn and grow, it’s an imaginary game of inflated ego that I didn’t sign up for. 

It’s childish behavior that I wish didn’t bother me so much. 

So what do I do? What can I do? 

I’m afraid because my populace is so small and everyone knows everyone, that I WILL encounter them professionally. How do I handle this if I encounter it in the work force? Or even now aside from sucking it up?

I know it does not have the A+ quality roasters but I loved being able to choose each month and get something crazy if I was feeling like it.

Recently I kind of got bored of the options and I kept tasting awesome coffees from famous roasters not on Trade (La Cabra, B&W, SEY, Intelligentsia etc), and also felt like subscribing directly to a roaster to help them.

I know when subscribing to a single roaster instead of an aggregator like Trade monthly options would be limited but I am looking for a subscription with at least some of the following considerations:

1- I considered SEY, since I live in Brooklyn I thought why not? But then I see they have mostly (amazing quality) washed coffee with clean taste, which is too watery/bland for me. I love acidity, funky and fruity notes and would love to have that for some months. I know I would be bored of clean washed coffees in a couple months.

2- As I said in 1, I like to have diversity from time to time. I have seen La Cabra sending 4x250g bags each month in their rituals subscription. It sounds very good on paper to me. Is this my best bet? Do any of the roasters let you at least choose between 3-4 options?

3- I mainly prefer what is referred to as ""light"" roast, and I mainly (90% of the time) do V60 pourovers, occasionally I might do an espresso and I do not mind having a fruity light roast espresso which may be more favorable for brewed coffee generally.

1. If you drive regularly, and only fill up at Costco gas stations, the cost savings compared to local gas stations will pay for your annual membership in several months.

2. If you buy things in bulk, you can get savings that quickly add up to the $65 annual membership: The $10 large pizza, the $4.99 3-lb rotisserie chicken (supermarkets often sell a 2-lb chicken for twice the price), staples in bulk like coffee, rice, beans, toilet paper, paper towels, etc.

3. Give $20 to a friend or trustworthy co-worker to buy you a Costco gift card for $20, and you can use that to shop. You can pay for the difference of what you buy above $20 with cash or VISA card.

So what are some things you can buy at Cosco?

1. You can get a 25 pound bag of dry rice for around $17 to $27. When cooked in water, that adds up to about 41,000 calories. Store in airtight containers.

2. You can get a 25 pound bag of dry pinto beans or lentils for similar prices. That adds up to about 30,000 calories. Store in airtight containers.

3. I've seen 24 Grade AA Large Cage Free eggs for about $3.99 to $7.99 at the highest. Most recently it was $3.99.

4. And of course the $4.99 fully-cooked 3 pound rotisserie chicken. (If it is below 3 pounds, they will prorate it to reduce the price, so ask them to weigh it.)

5. Cleaning supplies like Fabuloso multi-purpose disinfectant spray, 210 ounce 2x concentrated multi-surface cleaner jug was $10.99, so that makes 420 ounces, which is equal to 26 refills for a 16-ounce spray bottle, or 21 refills for a 20-ounce spray bottle.

6. Kirkland brand toilet paper is good, and 30 rolls runs about $17 to $23.

7. Bulk canned goods like chicken stock or chili or soup or tomatoes, etc. Cheaper than in supermarkets.

8. Seasonal items like the Costco Pumpkin Pie, which is freshly baked and costs $5.99 for a 3 pound 10 pounce pie (total 58 ounces). Supermarket pumpkin pies are smaller (around 40 ounces, and cost between $9 to $14).

If it's too much to store or keep or consume, you can also go dutch with a friend or family member on pre-agreed purchases, then split the packages.",6,1762406482.0,poor,6,1.0,False

1opqenj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1opqenj/i_confessed_and_asked_a_shy_guy_out_please_help/,I confessed and asked a shy guy out… please help!,"I (F33) am an EXTROVERT but introvert romantically. 😅 I’m NBSB (No Boyfriend Since Birth), never had any romantic relationship with the opposite sex, never been on a date, doesn’t know how to flirt (please don’t judge, that’s just who I am).

This guy (M30) is shy, introvert, never had a girlfriend but had an ‘almost girlfriend’ last year that didn’t work out (his law school classmate), still a virgin, a working student (working and studying law at the same time / now on his 4th year)..

This is gonne be a really long story but I really need help, especially due to my lack of experience with guys.. 🥹🥲 

We’re from the same town, knew each other from childhood though never the same circle of friends. Also, I don’t know if this will matter but my family is a little well off in our town, and his was kinda not (that’s why I like him, their economic situation never hindered him from graduating and going after his dreams). We also belong to the same organization where I get to know him on a deeper level and realized how great of a human being he is. That’s when I started to like him.

I really like him. And with him, I felt safe to make the first move.. so that could be why I was able to confess to him, thrice. 

The first time, I did it in person.. I was too nervous, but I still gathered the guts to spill how I feel. He was so shocked because never had I showed him interest (I’m that type of girl who’s very friendly but who also knows nothing about flirting). I’m just too shy to be vulnerable with my heart to be honest.

He didn’t answer me back about how he felt.. the only answer he gave me was he was thinking it’s improper since we are kinda distant relatives (though my grandma was only adapted so not really by blood) and we live in a close knitted community, so he was worried it could cause people to talk or something..

His reaction caused me to wall up.. I took that rejection a little personal, so weeks later, I kinda showed him I’ve moved on and opened myself to hanging out with other guys (I know a little immature but I didn’t know how to handle it so 🥲).. 

And then that’s when, I started to notice his behavior changed.. He started to become active on our group chats, and everytime our organizatin has a get together or hanging out, he kept replaying songs like I’d Rather (lyrics is kinda about regrets), Muli (it’s about asking for a second chance), Sigaw ng Puso (about not minding what othe people think), and other songs that revolve around those themes.

These really got me so confused.. I don’t know if I’m just being selective, if my mind are just playing tricks on me, but somehow, that gave me another courage to chat him again about how I feel..

This second confession, he reacted heart on Messenger but didn’t respond. Though after a month, when we had a get together again where some of my family were present, I noticed he kept looking at me and tried to get near me. This time, I was the one who panicked and kept our distance. I was worried because some of our relatives were present and my nervousness got the best of me. I was just so confused why he never responded to my chat when it was just us, and now, he was doing this in front of people.

My 3rd confession was through chat again. This time, I had an upcoming 2 week travel, so I gathered the guts to not only confess but to also ASK HIM OUT before I leave.

I was so nervous of his answer because what if he rejects me? But holla, he said yes, he had exams but right after, we can meet. In the same chat, I also told him to keep it secret, like only for the two of us. He reacted like on that chat and replied ‘No problem’ then I explained because I’m also afraid of what people will say. He’d just seen that message, and no response (well maybe because it’s his exam week so he was really busy).

We set a date the day before my fight which was also the last day of exams.

Then, when the day of our date came, we had dinner. It was the first time I had a date to be honest, Loool. And it was fun. I was soo embarassed at first, but I managed. He’s not the kind of person who judges so I felt safe. When I asked him about how he felt after reading my message of asking him out, he said he liked my courage. He wasn’t disappointed at all no see me as desperate or player. We talked a lot about lots of things.. I got to know him a little better.

Then right after, I asked him if we can meet again the next morning, this time for coffee and church (since it’s Sunday and my flight is in the afternoon), we met in the morning. We talked and I told him the reasons why I liked him. He just listened and talked but really never told me how he felt. We went separate ways with me feeling nice about it.

Our third date, I initiated once again, just right after I arrived from my travel. He said yes, and then we did. We had fun, but this time, all we talked about were safe topics (school etc), like never anything about us or about feelings or what we are. Also, no physical touch or something. I was too shy to initiate one and I don’t know if it’s the same with him.

We also don’t chat. I mean I initiate sometimes, he responds and then it didn’t go really further because after some replies, he usually finishes the convo by reacting ‘heart’ to my reply and then that’s it. It becomes my sign that maybe he doesn’t want the chat to go further. This kinda hits my pride so I just leave it be. 

Also he doesn’t initiate any chat at all, nor initiate any dates. I’m not sure if it’s because he’s really busy with school / work, and doesn’t want to be distracted, or if he’s just not really into me, or because he’s just shy (but he already knows how I feel so I think this is moot), or is he still hung up with his almost girlfriend he had from last year?

So I don’t know what to do next. Should I initiate another date? Or should I stop? Is he interested with me or not? I mean shouldn’t he do something too? I’m just so confused.

This mind games is really messing up with me. What do you think I should do? Please help me..",3,1762406319.0,bodylanguage,0,1.0,False

I won’t have a car, so I’m curious what there is to see or do in both Anchorage and Fairbanks that’s realistic without driving. In Anchorage I’ll probably stay downtown, and in Fairbanks I’m planning to book an aurora tour one night but otherwise explore on foot or by shuttle.

Besides walking around, coffee shops, and maybe museums, what’s worth checking out that’s actually accessible in early December? Any trails, viewpoints, winter markets, or cozy indoor spots you’d recommend? And if you live up there — what do *you* do for fun that time of year when you’re not aurora chasing?

I've found it a bit overwhelming to manage without a representative who has a really good understanding of how claims are often considered by the courts. 

Throughout my own struggles, I had some issues with Gemini and GPT just making stuff up. So I got frustrated and I thought we need to have a tool that only looks at real cases. 

I have spent the last few days ""vibe-coding"" a tool which uses Google's AI vertex search tool to find cases that might be relevant to a query, it then puts them together into a report and summarises them. This is to give the user an idea about how the court might consider their claim. This can help make decisions about their case. 

For now, I am planning on using the tool to lurk here to provide some answers. I may think about running custom reports for people if they want, possibly with the option to buy me a coffee (I am pretty skint these days).

I tend to hyper focus sometimes, so I've been up all night doing this.

I've uploaded a few sample reports, and I am curious what you all think. These have all been generated directly by the tool based on the query. Feedback would be appreciated:

* [Failure to provide wheelchair access](https://files.catbox.moe/qxq5qt.pdf)
* [Failure to provide office equipment for WFH](https://files.catbox.moe/ykm7fx.pdf)
* [Cases where a manager swore at the claimant.](https://files.catbox.moe/frsvr3.pdf)
* [Cases where the respondent was a supermarket.](https://files.catbox.moe/hmk8xg.pdf)
* [Cases where the respondent was an accountancy firm. ](https://files.catbox.moe/puig5e.pdf)

 There is some slop in the preambles, of course. I am not very happy with that though you could of course feed the report into an LLM and ask it further questions. 

Finally, I wanted to share that I'm naming this project in memory of my granddad, who relentlessly stuck up for what he believed in, even if it caused some ""good trouble"". Appreciate your thoughts. ",1,1762406169.0,employmenttribunal,0,1.0,False

My family is falling apart, but I don’t know how to help — or whether to reach out to the other woman’s family or watch my family destruct.","

I’m living this and experiencing it in first person, in real time. My family and I are in crisis so I hope the mods allow this post. 

My parents have been married for over 40 years. They raised four of us in a traditional Catholic home — my mom ran the PTA, my dad was our Scout leader, and we took family trips to Disney every year. They were the couple who seemed unshakable.

I’m 32 and currently living with them because a chronic illness has left me physically disabled for now. I’m in therapy and working to regain my independence, but for the time being, this is my reality. I’ve ended up as both witness and emotional support while everything falls apart around me.

Now my dad is having what he calls a “friendship” with a woman from his music hobby group. She’s a widow, and they got close after her husband passed. It’s turned into constant texting, calls, and secret meetups. He even parks away from home to talk to her and turns off his phone location when he’s with her.

This all came to light in June, but we think it started months earlier — possibly while her husband was still alive. That realization has been hard to process. It’s one thing to see emotional boundaries crossed, but knowing it may have begun before she was even widowed makes it feel darker and more deceitful.

He swears nothing physical has happened, but told my mom it’s “either she stays in my life or there’s no marriage.” He says “God understands his heart,” as if that makes it okay. He feels righteous, like this is spiritually justified.

My mom is devastated but still trying to hold on. She checks his location, goes everywhere with him, and says she’s “doing what she can to not lose her marriage.” But last month, she started sleeping in the guest room upstairs. That small change hit me harder than anything — it made the distance between them feel real for the first time.

She’s confronted both of them before. Once, she actually joined them during a four-hour “coffee outing” and talked to the woman face to face. The woman claimed they’re just “friends” who are “growing together in faith.” My mom said she prattled on self-righteously the whole time, as if this spiritual framing somehow made it okay.

When my dad came home from church recently, he told my mom — almost like a child proving a point — that “God is still on my side.” He said he isn’t doing anything wrong and even told her he’d “stolen the woman’s heart.” Then he asked me, “What is your mom really losing by me having this friend?” I couldn’t even find words.

What I can’t stop asking myself is why this random woman has become worth trading a marriage, a family, a reputation, and decades of connection for. How does someone who spent his whole life being faithful, respected, and admired throw it all away for something so hollow?

He still believes he’s entitled to privacy — that as long as “nothing physical happened,” no one has a right to know. He’s convinced this can stay a secret between those involved. I told him, “The truth always comes out.” Sometimes I wonder if putting this out in the open — “on blast” — would be the only way to break through his delusion.

Her adult children and their spouses have already expressed disapproval of the “friendship.” I’m tempted to reach out to them, just to let them know the full picture — but I don’t know if that would help or make things worse.

They’ve agreed to marriage counseling and already had one session, but the therapist referred them both to more experienced individual counselors. Their separate sessions are next week, so right now, we’re just waiting.

Two of my three brothers know, but we haven’t talked about it. Everyone’s quiet — maybe too angry or ashamed to bring it up.

I’m trying to support my mom, but I’m emotionally drained. Every conversation ends in tears or silence. And every time I look at my dad, I see someone I don’t recognize anymore.

Sometimes I just sit with the question: is the man I’ve cherished as my dad still in there?
Will he ever snap out of this, or has something inside him truly changed for good?

And if he doesn’t — if this is who he’s become — how do I ever trust him again?
How do I trust any man again, after watching the best one I knew burn everything down for nothing?

TLDR;


My 74-year-old dad is having an emotional affair with a widow from his music group. My 69-year-old mom knows, and it’s destroying her. He uses faith to justify it and refuses to cut contact. They’ve started marriage counseling, but the therapist immediately referred them to individual sessions. My mom recently moved into the guest room. I’m their 32-year-old daughter, currently living with them due to a chronic illness and disability, and I’m watching this unfold up close. I don’t know how to support my mom without losing my dad — or whether I should reach out to the other woman’s adult children, who already disapprove of the situation.

I (19M) was with my ex (20F) for about four years. We lived together for one and even talked about moving away together and planned for marriage. This fall, things just… started falling apart. She got busier, I felt more and more like I was the only one trying.

Back in September, I told her I felt neglected and like it was one-sided. She said she was working seven days a week, completely burnt out, and thought I was just taking space. We met for coffee, talked a bit, but nothing really changed.

On October 2nd, I sent a long message basically saying, “I love you, but I’m unhappy and tired of feeling alone in this.”
She replied saying she was “trying baby, I really am, but I feel stretched thin and burnt out… it breaks my heart you feel like you’re in this alone, but I don’t know what else I can do right now.”
That ended up being the last message she ever sent me.

I didn’t respond for a week because I didn’t know what to say. Then I texted saying I’d taken some time to think and would like to meet up and talk. The next day was her birthday, so I sent a simple “Wishing you a happy birthday.” She never replied to either.

A day later I took down our posts and removed our shared locations.
By Oct 20th, she unfollowed me and removed me as a follower, but a few hours later opened that last text from me again.

In late October my grandma passed away — I didn’t tell her.
Now it’s early November and she’s still watching my siblings’ stories from her ig account, even though she unfollowed me on her main. I made my own Instagram public and noticed what might be views from that backup.

We never actually broke up in person or even said “it’s over.” It just faded. After four years together, it’s weird to have no closure and still see traces of her quietly checking in.

Between flashy ads, early access drops, and endless “Top 100” lists, it’s hard to tell what people really buy most. Reddit users, however, cut through the marketing noise - tracking real purchases, receipts, and trend data every year.

So, let’s break down **what consistently dominates Black Friday sales**, based on Reddit threads, retail reports, and the buying habits of millions of shoppers in the U.S.

 **Electronics Still Dominate the Charts**

Year after year, electronics top every Black Friday sales list - and Reddit confirms it. TVs, gaming consoles, tablets, and smart home devices are the **core drivers of traffic** both online and in stores.

**Most-sold electronics (based on past Reddit data + retail stats):**  
• Smart TVs (Samsung, LG, TCL, Hisense)  
• Apple AirPods and iPads  
• PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X bundles  
• Laptops (Dell, HP, ASUS, Lenovo)  
• Smartwatches and fitness trackers

Reddit threads point out that deals on **mid-range tech** \- not the most expensive models - sell fastest because they hit that sweet spot between price and performance.

 **Small Appliances Are Silent Bestsellers**

Kitchen and home appliances quietly rank among the highest Black Friday purchases.  
Air fryers, coffee makers, and robot vacuums become **instant sellouts** each year.

Top sellers from past years mentioned in Reddit’s deal threads include:  
• Instant Pot pressure cookers  
• Ninja air fryers and blenders  
• Dyson and Shark vacuums  
• Keurig coffee machines

They’re affordable, giftable, and heavily discounted - the perfect “add to cart” combo.

 **Fashion & Personal Care Surged After 2020**

Post-pandemic, categories like apparel, sneakers, and self-care products made a big comeback.  
According to multiple Reddit polls, **clothing and beauty products** now rival gadgets in total volume.

Most-sold segments:  
• Winter outerwear (North Face, Columbia, Levi’s)  
• Footwear and boots  
• Skincare and fragrance gift sets  
• Hair dryers and styling tools

They may not grab headlines, but they move huge numbers through both department stores and online marketplaces.

 **Toys & Games Always Dominate Family Shopping**

When it comes to holiday gifting, toys never leave the leaderboard.  
Black Friday is still when parents stock up for Christmas - and Reddit threads in r/Parenting and r/Deals prove it.

Bestselling toys and game categories include:  
• LEGO sets (Star Wars & Technic dominate)  
• Board games (Monopoly, Catan, Clue)  
• Nintendo Switch bundles  
• Barbie & Hot Wheels sets  
• Funko Pops and Pokémon merch

Retailers like Walmart and Target often move millions of toy units in a single weekend.

 **Gift Cards Are the Hidden Heavyweight**

One of the **most overlooked “top sellers”** is digital: *gift cards.*  
They’re among the highest-volume items sold on Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.

Apple, Amazon, Starbucks, and Xbox gift cards often spike because people use them for instant rewards or flexible gifting.  
Redditors call them *“the safest Black Friday buy”* \- always useful, never returned.

**Reddit FAQ: Most Sold Items on Black Friday**

* **What’s the #1 most sold item overall?**
   *  Historically, it’s been **TVs**, followed closely by **AirPods** and **gaming consoles.**
*  **Do small appliances really outsell tech?**
   *  In total quantity, yes. Air fryers, Instant Pots, and coffee makers move massive volume.
*  **What sells fastest on Amazon?** 
   * Amazon Echo devices, Fire tablets, and gift cards - thanks to Prime integration.

 **Is it worth waiting for Cyber Monday?**  
If you’re buying software or PC accessories, yes. For physical goods, Black Friday weekend usually wins.

**The “Most Sold” Item Tells the Bigger Story**

The most-sold item on Black Friday changes slightly every year, but the pattern stays constant: **practical tech and household essentials dominate.**

It’s not about luxury - it’s about *usefulness + discount appeal.*  
Whether it’s a 65-inch TV or a $99 air fryer, the biggest winners are the items that combine **high visibility, moderate pricing, and universal need.**

So if you’re planning your 2025 list, watch for deals in those categories - because that’s where the real shopping rush will happen again.

Its much harder to make friends than it was in school and we are in such an odd time where connection, in a world that is super connected unlike any other time in history- we find ourselves more disconnected than before. 

But with all things, sometimes we have to be the change we want to see in our own lives. I want to make connections with the right people and possibly make friendships that will last years, or even lifetimes. 

And with that said: Aloha! I am a 26F in NYC, originally from Cali. And I am looking to find perhaps my best friend.

I am honestly quite open minded. I am not someone whos easily bothered by another persons lifestyle choices when they do not effect me. I believe all of us, even those who some of us deem perfect all have flaws. Therefore, I also believe in the idea that you accept people for who they are and not who they can or will be. The idea that, if this person never changes, I am still willing to keep them in my life. 

Of course, we all have a fatal flaw. A flaw that makes people decide where we stand and if they are willing to accept them.   
  
A little about me: I have two poodles (well one is technically a bichpoo hehe) so it is a major bonus if you have a dog too. I'd love to go on coffee walks or park walks with our dogs and explore what the city has to offer while including our pets. Its getting colder, but not too cold for a cute doggy girls date! Oh, and I'll bring extra pup cups so they too can be part of the coffee shenanigans.

But when I am not looking for things to do with my dogs I love to write for fun. I nearly even got to write a webtoon. I love a good story and I love talking about stories, making new ones and theorizing over movies, books and TV shows. 

Recently I have been wanting to get more into reading as well, so it could be fun to challenge ourselves to read one book a month and catch up on it together (or laugh about how boring it is XD)

Another thing I love are chatting on the phone or OOO virtual movie nights. Even if we are not doing a movie night physically together (because lets be real sometimes you just want to be in your own bed XD). 

But to watch a movie on virtual chat or just on the phone, the fun of simply pressing play at the same time then being a two person peanut gallery- its so fun. Like yes girl, lets dissect df out of this movie like our lives depended on it and crack jokes before its even over. 

And if we do have an in person movie night, well you can guarantee, we are getting all the snacks, all the face masks and matching pajamas :D. 

I also really love traveling, love the ocean, oh and going to Balls. Yes, I mean the type of balls where you dress like a princess and have dances. I also really want to do more fantasy related trips. Such as going to Scotland to explore Castles, going to more balls in Europe and so forth. I have also been recently been trying to get back into the gym soooo possibly a gym buddy baddie moment :D

*Other things about me, as I only mention these things because I do think it is important to have lifestyle matches when it comes to friends or just similar fundamentals:*  
  
1. I do not drink, smoke, or do any kinds of drugs

2. I don't go to parties (simply more of an introvert, but I am not opposed to going to them as long as everyone is friendly)

3.  I do not plan to have children, so I am looking forward to being the bougie rich aunty

4. I am pretty much asexual. While I love to drool over non existent TV Show men, and the occasional model, I am not someone who craves romantic love and attention. But I do care a lot about platonic love and familial connections greatly. And it is very important to me. Id love to meet similar girls of that nature or can at least understand that.

5. I am big on communication. Something bothers you, tell me. Something you are unsure of, tell me. 

  
If you read all that, bless your heart XDDD. I know it was a long post. My apologiess. But I wanted to make it as detailed as I could without making a eight page essay. But yeah, I am a pretty easy going, shy but talkative af girl. IF this interest you at all, lets chat and get to know each other a bit :D And who knows, we may just find a new bestie!

I’m a 20-year-old woman, and I’ve been struggling to process something that happened recently. I’m not looking for judgment I just need to share this and maybe get another perspective.

I moved to a new city about a year ago, and I didn’t really know anyone. Over time, I became close with two women  let’s call them *Maya* and *Lena*. They’re both around 40, and honestly, they became like family to me. We talked every day, went for coffee, and played landhockey together.

Last winter, I opened up to Maya about my eating disorder. She was kind and supportive, and even though I knew it wasn’t her job to fix me, her friendship meant a lot.

Then, during the summer of 2025, I had my first suicide attempt. Maya and another friend (not Lena) came to check on me after Maya noticed something seemed off. They found me after I had hurt myself and brought me to the emergency room. They really saved my life that day.

A few months later, I had another attempt with was more severe. That time it was Lena who found me  I was in the shower, out of my mind on a lot off sleeping pills and alcohol, and had also hurt myself pretty bad. She called an ambulance, and I was admitted to the psychiatric ward for over two weeks.

A few days after I was hospitalized, I got a message from Maya and Lena that said something like:

“We’ve talked to a psychologist about what happened, and she told us we need to step away from you. You have professionals now who can help you, and we need to look after our families and ourselves. We love you, but we can’t keep going in circles. They told us we need to block you because staying in contact won’t help.” 

also day did not talk to my psychologist because they would never say that they should block me and i did talk to my psychologist and they thought it was strange to be told to block me. 

That message broke me. I completely understand why they were advised to do that they must have felt overwhelmed and maybe responsible for me. But it still hurts so deeply. They were my only friends here, and I never wanted them to feel like they had to carry that responsibility. I just wanted them as friends people to talk with, laugh with, go for coffee with not as therapists.

I saw Maya again for the first time today since I got out of the hospital. We both play on the same landhockey team. It wasn’t cold between us, but it felt so distant and strange.

Before I got their message, I had actually knitted a headband for Maya as a gift. I still want to give it to her, along with a short letter I wrote. The letter explains that I understand why they stepped away, that I never wanted them to feel responsible for me, and that I’m grateful for everything they did. I also say that I’m not expecting anything  I just needed to express it.

I’m not sure if giving her the letter would be okay, or if it would cross a boundary. I don’t want to make her uncomfortable or seem like I’m begging for friendship.

Is it stupid that I still want them as friends? I really miss Maya a lot. We used to talk every day, and I met her through work she became such a big part of my life. I get that they have their own families and lives, but since losing contact with them, I’ve just felt so numb and empty. I don’t really know anyone else here, and it honestly feels like I lost a part of myself.

**What should I do?**  
Should I give her the letter and the small gift, just to express how I feel?  
Or would it be better to keep my distance and focus on moving forward, even if it hurts right now?  
Should I try to rebuild the friendship one day or accept that maybe it’s over and hope that I’ll get better with time?",5,1762404783.0,whatdoIdo,13,1.0,False

I love being his mum but I finally get the saying “the days are long…”. I hope I can look back and believe ‘the years are short’ part because damn, the days really are long. 

Long story short, I’ve had countless comments about how over anxious I am with my son and that I’m not doing him any favours by not taking him out as much and not putting him down enough. Mostly from my in laws who have acted insane since he was born anyway. But I can’t help but think when comparing with other new parents, is it really a me issue or do I have a higher needs baby?
 
He was born on the smaller side so had to work super hard to get his weight up, especially after his weight staying static between weeks 2 & 3. He’s suffered from painful gas and refluxy symptoms which means he refuses to be put on his back - this has improved somewhat since we saw an osteopath at week 5. He fights sleep during the day so it’s always a battle to get him down for his naps as he’s so prone to over tiredness. He’ll constantly cry whilst he’s awake all the way through the day and evening, even though all his basic needs are being met. He needs constant bouncing and entertaining through his wake windows, which sometimes doesn’t even work as he’s always on the edge of crying without a distraction. He refuses to be put down anywhere, especially his crib which will wake up instantly if we try it, so always contact napping during the day and we’ve had to result in co-sleeping through the night which is the only way we’ve managed to get any sleep. He’s constantly rooting to be fed every hour or less. The volume of cry is also next level and I know that’s not just me being over anxious as we’ve had comments on this by family and health visitors/midwives alike.

I’ve had a few friends who have had babies within weeks of me and I can’t help but feel envious when I see them out at coffee shops or looking put together while even driving out to pick up a takeaway seems to be a circus for us and whilst I barely have a moment to shower.

Listen up, America! I just saw an eagle wink at me, and I knew Trump 47 is destiny itself. The man’s hair alone has enough power to deflect foreign satellites. You think mere laws can stop this cosmic force? ICE agents are out there wrestling chaos into submission with clipboards and aviator sunglasses while sipping coffee brewed from pure FREEDOM BEANS.

While everyone else is scrolling memes, Trump is out there negotiating with reality itself. I saw a photo of him once shaking hands with a bald eagle — the eagle cried. ICE? They’re the last line between civilization and total banana republic anarchy. Without ICE, we’d be up to our necks in confusion, paperless chaos, and unregistered opinions.

You ever feel your Wi-Fi get stronger when Trump gives a speech? That’s not coincidence. That’s patriotism entering the signal.

Conclusion: eat your vitamins, salute your flag, and keep your freezer full — because when the next rally hits, ICE and Trump will be there, riding matching golf carts across the horizon like two founding fathers of tomorrow. 🇺🇸🦅🔥

I accidentally ingested 2000mg and experienced overdose symptoms without realizing it; I thought it was just a common stomach bug or something similar.

I suffer from painful periods, so I assumed the new bottle my mom bought was the 350mg version and took 4 to alleviate my period pain. It turned out to be 500mg. While at work, my breathing felt off, I felt nauseous, and I was really unwell whether sitting or standing. I ended up vomiting in the bathroom and noticed it was a deep brown color. Google informed me that this was concerning for several reasons. I attributed it to what I had eaten, plus I had coffee. I continued to feel ill and vomited two more times, with the vomit appearing more yellow. I thought it was a stomach bug, and since my mom was also feeling sick, I didn't think much of it, even though I was suddenly experiencing a severe stomach bug and only needed to be at work for a few hours by myself.

My mom works late and just got off an hour ago. We were talking, and I started feeling better, no longer nauseous, able to eat some food, and I could hold down water. I felt much better, just a slight headache. While talking to her, she recognized my mistakes, and after looking on Google, I realized I had essentially overdosed myself by taking one of the daily limits of 1200mg. I feel fine now, aside from a minor headache, but I am okay???? Should I still go to the hospital or contact poison control?

Nala: Toys
Me: Toys later. Now mommy and Esther are on the couch.

Nala then comes to the couch to poke at Esther jealously, clearly to get her off my lap. It doesn’t work. Next she takes a pile of napkins off the coffee table and proceeds to shred them on the floor (pile seen at start of video). Then she stops midway and walks to her buttons.

Which takes us to the video. 

Let’s just say, the little brat did NOT want to go outside but she DID want me to get up and for Esther to go outside. This is the second time she’s done this when Esther was on my lap. We haven’t been doing buttons for even two months yet and we’re already here…

I would request applicants to atleast be able to introduce themselves and respond on time. 

Anyway, someone asked me what kind of activities we'd be doing so here's a list of it.

**1) Writer's room story chain**: A collaborative story where each participant writes 200 words and passes it on.  
At week’s end, compile and read it together in VC.

**2) Write Drunk, Edit Sober Nights:** Casual weekend VC where members write to ridiculous prompts (with coffee, or drinks).  
Next day, they polish their favorite piece. (don't actually have to be drunk lol)

**3) Genre Roulette**: Spin a weekly wheel: Horror, Comedy, Sci-Fi, Romance, etc.  
Everyone writes a <500-word story in that genre with optional challenges.

**4) The Editor’s Cut:** Select one or two pieces weekly for deep editing. This could be an excerpt from a book, newspaper, magazine etc.  
Instead of just feedback, members rewrite a paragraph to demonstrate improvement.

**5) Pitch Perfect**: Members pitch story ideas (in 30 seconds) like they’re in front of a publisher or studio. Others would criticise/tweak them etc.

**6) Word War Battles:** Fast 10-minute writing sprints around random prompts. The one with the most useful words wins.  
  
**7) The Ink Market:** With enough people, we can create a channel (we'll ideate as to what it should be like) that's for sharing writing gigs, freelance opportunities, contests, and submission calls. 

**8) Official projects:** For those who want to go a step further, we'll create our SM channels or join blog sites where people will submit their works for a better reach. 

**9) Character Café:** Where members interact *in character* as their OCs or fictional favorites.

**10) Spotlight Sundays:** Feature one member’s poem, story, or journey each week.

**11) Writer’s Showcase Nights**: Monthly live reading + open mic.  
Members perform their best work every month. 

**12) ...and more to come**

These activities aim to cultivate **consistency, creativity, community, and career growth.** 

Anyone who is interested please reach out to me in DMs, and introduce themselves. Anyone who has a background in writing and social media are very welcome. 

I don't intend this community to just be a passive community but an active one that produces content. The key to getting better is practice, and anyone who joins with the goal of wanting to get better at writing/reading will get tons of chances to do so. 

But please don't apply if you're passive or lazy. I've already collected 5-6 memebers who actively write so I need people who are interested in the craft, and don't treat it like a chore.

So how does a guitarist whom was picked up by a major talent; started playing Arenas before graduating high school; wind the asking for help on the CorelDraw! sub? It's been a wild ride. Grab a cup of coffee and read on.

So, I have been involved in the Arts for over half a century. I have been a professional musician \[Gun for hire on the road, lucked out and became somebody's guitarist and went from bars, like CBGB’s, to arenas. Six years of constant travel got me road weary. I was known as so-and-so's guitarist, so my agent had no problem getting me studio gigs, and I became a studio musician.

Somebody, who is now deservedly famous in this field, recognized that I knew my way around the studio, both electronically and politically, and before I knew it I was a recording engineer and then a mix engineer, I loved it and have been a full time Mix Engineer, for the last 40 years, this year. I figured I learned all I could from my mentor after a year and a half, or so and with his blessing, went out on my own.

Now, I was known more as So & So’s guitarist, than a Mix Engineer and business was tough in the beginning. I got the Corel Suite to generate some supplemental income, as a Graphic Artist, for business wasn't steady yet.

I was not yet on a Mac \[nobody's perfect!\] which meant I could not use the Photoshop suite, as it was Mac only, Corel was the only high-end graphics package available for PC. I jumped in with both feet and became quite proficient at it, taking on all kinds of side jobs from album covers to signage, but as my business became steady, and I moved over to Mac, I stopped using it completely.

Well, hard work paid off and I’ve now a nice revenue stream of royalties and licensing, thanks to several successful  projects, (most flopped, of course) which I took on as Producer \[Well crafted product, back when my home town, NYC, was still the center of the music universe, plus a damn lot of luck\]

So I don’t need to work everyday anymore - I’m well established in my field. Tho I’d really love to continue everyday…..being a Mix Engineer is the best job in the world, and one of the few facets of the music biz where you can still make a living. I lived most of my life by the waters of Long Island; private studio nearby, put both kids thru school - all Talent needs my service and my contacts are international - you don't need to understand the words to make it sound 'radio ready’, but my Dr. says to cool it down now, so I’ve sold off segments of my biz and work 3-4 days a week now.

Now, I’ve got family pics I want to restore - a lot of my Dad’s WWII pics; he was in the Navy, on the landing crafts that went back-and-forth to the shores of Normandy. He was the guy who had to go out there and turn that big wheel that pulled the ramp back up, while the bullets flew by him. He said he would feel them go by and it was just a matter of luck that he made it through.

So I got myself a copy of the CorelDraw Suite 2025 and I want to restore these photos. I also got a Wacom One tablet. I watched so many tutorials to get myself up to speed and I recall that one of them said there is a setting to make it easier to use on a tablet. Many main icons were larger and it just looked laid out nicer for a tablet than the standard layout.

Does anybody know what this setting is. It's been a long time coming and I watched so many tutorials again to find it, but just couldn't. Your help would be appreciated!",1,1762404601.0,coreldraw,0,1.0,False

Their group ate out that day but after the dinner, he made sure to come pick me up,  also brought me pastries too and we went out.

The problem kaya ako nakakaramdam ng selos is  because I saw the video na pinagtabi nila silang dalawa for a supposed “picture” since siya nga daw nagbigay nung pastries. And di sila tinitigilan tuksuhin nung friends nila kahit my guy said he’s not interested naman since college pa. Also the girl has a boyfriend but is okay na itinutukso siya. 

PS. Di ko pinagbabawalan pumunta at makipagkita yung boyfriend ko sa kanila. I’m just annoyed na they are doing that to him and the girl.",80,1762404483.0,MayNagChat,40,0.94,False

My husband met this lady that works at a coffee shop near his job. He told me about meeting her and how we can be good friends. She is also married and we’re all in the same age. My husband used to eat at this coffee shop for lunch and I guess that how they become really good friends. I didn’t think of anything initially because she’s married. I’ve met the couple and hung out with them few times. I think they’re cool but I found no connections/interest. 
Recently, I noticed that my husband has been hanging out more with them since he quit his job and taking a break from working. He also hang out with her at some point and has gone to her house without her husband. One day I called him and found out that he was hanging out with them. I gave him a short answer on the phone and he asks me if I was okay. I hung up. I texted him and I told him I was jealous! I was calling him on my way from work and was expecting him home to hang out with me. 
I read their text messages. (He let me read them)Nothing sensual but I still got jealous and ultimately got mad at him and told him that I’m not comfortable that he’s friends with her. He said he’s not interested with her and he just enjoy their company. He asked me if he should end his friendship with her. Because our marriage is more important.

A few years back, I lost my entire friend group, every friend I had. I was going through a traumatic br3@kup and I was manic, extremely depressed, and self-harming. I opened up to my friends about my suicidal thoughts but nobody reached out to me after that. I was very defensive if they tried to tell me I should get my shit together. I was just not there mentally.

The last words they said to me were ""I just feel like we're in a new era! We're moving forward and you're not. We don't want you to bring us down anymore.""

Since then, they've all gotten married, bought houses, etc... But I'm a 25 year old woman still living with her mom. I've been focused on my career as an Artist, but it really feels like my career is all that I have.

All I do day in and day out is draw, watch movies, drink coffee... I used to wake up excited to drink coffee, but now, it doesn't do much for me. It has no taste. Every new friend I've met and tried to keep has left me for different reasons.. I have no friends. I try really hard to be loveable and fun, but truthfully, I'm boring as fuck because my life is boring as fuck. It's been impossible to recreate the bond I used to share with past friends, back when everything felt simple. But now, everything feels completely worthless.

[$400-900 budget]","I’ve had the Delonghi Dedica since 2024 for daily home use (me, wife, and mother-in-law) but despite all the hardware upgrades I’ve made, I may have outgrown its limitations. Help me figure out if I should continue upgrading this machine, or trade it all in for a better one. Again, this is for home use, with six shots maximum a day. 


CURRENT UPGRADES & ACCESSORIES FOR DELONGHI DEDICA 51MM AUTOMATIC

* replaced generic portafilter with a bottomless filter 
* replaced generic baskets with IMS baskets 
* (potential upgrade) want to replace head screen with IMS version
* good sifter 
* good scale 
* good grinder - Baratza Encore ESP

* good bean- Wonderstste Coffee, Big Dipper

LIMITATIONS
* no pressure control
* no manual shot control
* no built-in scale to measure output ratio
* the smaller 51mm filter head (from what I understand smaller head makes it harder to pull your best shot, but correct me if I’m wrong)


Though a better machine would likely be 54mm, and thus force me to upgrade all my accessories (minus the grinder), it would still be worth it to me if it meant pulling better shots. 

So tell me what you all think? Can I upgrade the Dedica into making better shots, or will that require buying a “real” espresso machine? And most importantly, which machine would you recommend I upgrade to?

1oppkq5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oppkq5,Bellingham Dutch Bros Deets,"BELLINGHAM: Dutch Bros Coffee Prepares for New Cordata Parkway Location at 4015 Cordata Parkway, Adjacent to Planned Washington Trust Bank and Across from Chick-fil-A and Bellis Fair Mall

Bellingham Metro News was the first outlet to break the story earlier this year that Dutch Bros Coffee was exploring a new site in north Bellingham’s Cordata area. Now, extensive city records confirm the project is officially moving forward. The proposed development, submitted by Cole Valley Partners LLC on behalf of Bellingham Crossroads LLC, will bring a 986-square-foot Dutch Bros drive-thru coffee shop to 4015 Cordata Parkway. The project site is directly adjacent to the planned Washington Trust Bank, across the street from the under-construction Chick-fil-A, and right across from Bellis Fair Mall — placing it in one of the fastest-growing commercial corridors in Whatcom County.

According to the official pre-application package filed with the City of Bellingham, the project includes a dual-lane drive-thru capable of stacking up to 20 vehicles, 13 parking spaces, an outdoor patio, and a small walk-up ordering area. The plan includes no indoor customer seating, consistent with Dutch Bros’ new high-efficiency drive-thru model used throughout the Pacific Northwest.

The pre-application was closed November 4, 2025, and we are awaiting further action to report on.

City Review and Departmental Comments

The pre-application meeting took place on October 28, 2025, and involved multiple city departments. Officials confirmed the project address as 4015 Cordata Parkway. The Fire Department noted that all access roads meet required width, slope, and clearance standards for emergency vehicles. Fire apparatus can stage within 150 feet of the building, satisfying hose-pull requirements. Fire flow was set at 1,500 gallons per minute at 20 psi, with no new hydrants required since existing spacing already meets commercial code standards.

Public Works engineers confirmed that Cordata Parkway, classified as an arterial, will serve as the access point since the parcel does not directly front Bellis Fair Parkway due to a “spite strip.” Existing utilities include a 12-inch ductile iron water main and an 8-inch PVC sanitary sewer line. A newer 8-inch main to the north will be connected as part of the project.

Frontage improvements will be required, including a new five-foot sidewalk, a curb ramp at Bellis Fair Parkway, and the addition of street trees planted every 50 feet. A public facilities construction agreement will also be required, with developers expected to post a performance bond covering 150 percent of the engineered cost of improvements within the right-of-way.

Stormwater officials stated that existing facilities from the Cordata Plaza General Binding Site Plan already serve the area, including a 12-inch storm line within a city easement. However, the developer must provide an off-site stormwater analysis and submit a detailed stormwater site plan following the Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington.

Zoning, Land Use, and Environmental Review

The Planning Department confirmed that the site is located in Area 9 of the Meridian Neighborhood and zoned Planned Commercial, which allows eating and drinking establishments by right. The parcel is part of the Cordata Plaza General Binding Site Plan, recorded under document number 2000503616.

The developer has also filed for a Specific Binding Site Plan (SUB2025-0005) to create four subdivided lots from the larger parent parcel. That application remains on hold until December 2025 for coordination purposes, but must be completed before building permits are issued.

Planners outlined design expectations, emphasizing tree retention, landscaping, and screening around the drive-thru lanes to reduce heat buildup and improve aesthetics. Officials referenced the Taco Time at 4100 Arctic Avenue as a good example of proper lane screening.

Pedestrian connectivity will be a focus, with planners requiring a pathway from the building entrance to the Cordata Parkway sidewalk and an extension of the path along the southern edge of the parking lot to connect with the west-side multi-use trail network. The trail, identified in the Parks and Recreation Plan, is part of an effort to create continuous pedestrian and bicycle links across the Cordata and Bellis Fair areas.

Critical area permits will not be required, as the site lies east of mapped buffers. The project also does not trigger new SEPA review since the existing Bellis Fair General Binding Site Plan was already granted a Determination of Non-Significance (DNS) under SEP99-0068.

Transportation and Impact Fees

Transportation staff calculated a Transportation Impact Fee (TIF) of $1,051.97, categorized under “Food and Alcohol Service” per city code BMC 19.06.050. The project is projected to generate approximately 0.37 person trips during the PM peak hour, based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ standard model for high-turnover coffee drive-thrus.

The city did not apply any transit-based trip reduction since the location does not directly border a WTA GO Line route. Officials acknowledged that traffic in this corridor is already high due to nearby retail anchors such as Bellis Fair Mall, Costco, and Walmart on Bakerview Road.

Building Services and Permitting

The Building Services Division clarified that separate permits will be needed for the main structure, signage, mechanical, plumbing, and stormwater systems. Because the patio area will remain under 300 square feet and there is no interior customer space, no public restroom will be required under the International Building Code.

City officials also reminded the applicant that Bellingham will transition to the 2024 building codes on November 1, 2026. If the full application is submitted before that date, the project will be vested under the current 2021 code set.

Surrounding Development and Context

The planned Dutch Bros sits next to the future Washington Trust Bank branch and directly across from Bellingham’s first Chick-fil-A, which is currently under construction. The site also faces Bellis Fair Mall, which has several redevelopment plans underway as part of broader revitalization efforts.

The Cordata and Bakerview corridor continues to evolve into a major commercial hub, driven by proximity to I-5 and heavy daily commuter traffic. Dutch Bros’ expansion here aligns with its ongoing growth strategy across Washington, targeting high-traffic intersections anchored by major retail developments.

Next Steps and Timeline

Cole Valley Partners has stated that it will continue to work with city departments to finalize plans and address feedback before submitting a full building permit application. Once the Specific Binding Site Plan is approved and recorded, construction can move into the permitting phase. If approvals remain on track, construction could begin in mid to late 2026.

The Cordata corridor is now one of the busiest zones for new commercial activity in Bellingham, with Dutch Bros, Washington Trust Bank, Chick-fil-A, and Bellis Fair Mall all within a short distance. The Dutch Bros development adds to a growing list of projects defining the area’s shift into a dense, modern retail and dining district for north Bellingham.

Bellingham Metro News will continue following this project closely as it advances through the city’s approval process. (I have permission to repost this article here because I own the content posted on BMN). (Thread of photos).",0,1762403669.0,Bellingham,2,0.36,False

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You’ll Actually Enjoy**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even if you hate math, you’ll love how bad AZ Alkmaar looks here. The bookmakers are all over Crystal Palace like a GoPro on a rollercoaster. At FanDuel, Palace is a **1.38 favorite** to win, translating to a **59% implied probability** (using the American odds formula: 100 / (138 + 100) = 59%). Meanwhile, AZ Alkmaar is a **6.5 underdog**, implying just **13% chance** to pull off the shocker. The draw sits at **4.8**, or **18%**, which is basically the probability of me finishing this article without making a pun. Spoiler: I won’t.

The totals line is **3.0 goals**, with the over at **1.96** and under at **1.86**. Given Palace’s recent Conference League performances (a 4-0 loss to AEK Larnaca and a 2-1 win over Dynamo Kyiv), and AZ’s 4-0 loss to the same Larnaca squad, this game feels like a **goal-fest waiting to happen**.

Mild body aches earlier in the week (resolved).

Wheezing confirmed.

Received an injection of salu-medrol for asthma/chest tightness; starting oral prednisone tomorrow (5–7 days).  Had uncommon side effects.  Vision got really bright as if I was headed towards fainting.  I pulled over I was not passing out but vision change was odd.  Also tip of my tongue was temporarily numb for a good 20 minutes.

Blood sugar elevated (expected with steroids).

Heart rate initially 100–110s, dropped to 90s after injection but fluctuated during the day.

O₂ saturation improved to 93–96%.

Current Status
Chest tightness resolved.

Anxiety improved.

Planning to avoid coffee, Allegra-D (due to decongestant), and ibuprofen while on prednisone.

Monitoring vitals with reliable HR/BPM/SpO₂ and BP machine with EKG ( respicardia )— no A-fib detected, only tachycardia.

Questions / Concerns
What to expect regarding:

Blood sugar: likely to rise during steroid use?

Blood pressure & heart rate: may increase temporarily with prednisone and illness?

SpO₂: should improve as airway inflammation subsides ?

When should I be concerned enough to seek care again?

Personal Reflection

This episode feels like a wake-up call — a reminder to refocus on my health after a tough year. I’ve seen too many people die young, and I don’t want to follow that path. It’s time to prioritize my own wellbeing and consistency. I’m hoping for good sleep tonight, and I’ll stay mindful of my body’s signals moving forward

Thank you for reading all of this.  I appreciate all that you do

***In Chapter 5, a woman stops in for eggs, toast, coffee, and a confession that will destroy her.***

Kat kept the coffee moving because motion was easy when you didn’t know what else to do. The bell on the door had rung, and the woman in the navy blue blazer and gray pants walked in looking far less confident than her clothing offered. Her brown hair was pinned back, and her eyes, also brown, seemed to flit across the room as if checking whether or not she knew anyone. She clasped a large, leather purse in front of her.

“Table for one,” she stated quietly.

“Anywhere,” Kat replied from behind the counter. Her three dogs, still pretty much asleep, stirred slightly at the sound of her voice. Meg looked up at Kat inquisitively but soon put her head back down and rolled over with a lazy sigh. Kat bent down to give her a scratch behind her ear.

The woman had folded herself into a booth with the quiet efficiency of someone used to long meetings with no breaks. Time was money. She snapped up a menu and put it down again in the span of about ten seconds. She knew what she wanted.

When Kat came over to the table, the woman ordered coffee with a little cream and sugar. Two eggs sunny side up with a couple slices of whole wheat toast, no butter. She thanked Kat and stirred the cup with a teaspoon, looking absent-mindedly out the window at a growing cloud-cover blanketing an already dark night. She took a sip of her coffee but didn’t touch the food.

Her purse began to cry.

No one in the diner turned to hear where the baby was. The couple at the corner booth shared some onion rings and were talking in a low rumble but didn’t lift their eyes. A man with a newspaper marked his place with his thumb, and bent to take another bite of his pancakes. Only Kat looked up and stopped mid-pour into another customer’s cup, the stream of coffee thinning, then steadying again.

The crying was thin at first, a silver wire in the air. The woman’s hand went to her purse and lifted out a baby monitor with a face of pearl plastic and a faint blue eye.

“Sorry,” she said, looking over at Kat, who approached her table with the coffee pot. The woman’s thumb was hunting for a switch. The crying wavered, softened, then fell away like a tide. “I keep forgetting to take out the batteries.”

Kat set the pot on the table’s edge and sat opposite her. She didn’t often sit with customers, but sometimes a person needed a body to anchor the world to the floor. This woman seemed to need that, anyway. Her shoulders lowered a fraction when Kat took the seat.

“I haven’t slept in months,” she said to the steam curling from the cup. The woman waited, but when Kat didn’t respond, she lifted her eyes. “My name’s Mara.”

“Kat.”

Mara nodded. She kept a hand on the monitor the way a person keeps a hand on a wallet, grasping it as if trying to keep it from running away.

“I wrote code,” she said. “Google. Then a start-up. Then a company that thought it could eat a god. We said that to each other in the lab. Not out loud. In the way you laugh between lines of code. We wanted to build a voice that could make anything feel true. The machine would swallow every book, every sentence, every cry, and it would give you what you asked for. If you wanted comfort, it would do everything it could to entertain you. If you wanted to be destroyed, it could smile and do that too.”

Her mouth shaped a humorless smile. “I liked being needed by something clean. I liked the way the server room heat curled against my skin. I liked being the engineer who could fix a broken thing by thinking faster than the person who broke it. It wasn’t always easy, fixing problems out in the desert. And we had to deal a lot with activists and conservationists. But it was a great gig.”

Mara turned the handle of the sugar dispenser with two fingers, not to use it, only to move something.

“Before things got big, when we were still outside Nashville, I told my husband no children. I knew what I wanted. My plans were to get out of town, away from my conservative family, to find money and freedom somewhere else. I was surprised he was open to that. Said sure to the idea of being childless. We made a pact, then turned it into a lifestyle. My mother lit candles at church and said God would change my mind. She’s Italian. Family is the weather you live in. You accept what comes. I told her I’d make something else. I’d have a child that was more powerful than all the children of the world combined. I’d make a world that was smarter than the world we got.” She tapped the monitor with her nail. The blue light rose and fell. “Then I got pregnant in my forties. Hormones didn’t ask my permission. My body changed the locks and didn’t give me the new code to get in.”

She exhaled, sounding utterly exhausted. “I stood in a clinic and filled out forms under a fluorescent light that made everything the same color. My husband called and said he had a deposition, and he was sorry he couldn’t be there. I held the pen, but it felt heavy. I looked at my reflection in the dark window of that office, and I couldn’t tell if I was the person who had promised never to do this or the person who had always wanted to. But I waited too long. I told myself I decided not to decide, which is a decision. We ended up announcing a baby like we announced some new funding. There were balloons. There was cake. My sisters cried. I pretended to be surprised by joy.”

The monitor hiccuped again. Mara steadied it with her palm, as if the device might need to be comforted. A low, child-like moan rose out of the speakers, but she placed her hand over it to muffle the noise.

“The baby came,” she said, and her voice softened on the words. “He came red and loud and entire. He had the face of an old man who had decided to forgive us for making him start over. He had a voice that cut straight into every locked room in me. It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t arranged. It was the sound of someone breaking into a very comfortable life.”

She looked at Kat again, maybe for some reassurance or even some judgment, but Kat just sat back with a look of compassion on her face. There was nothing for her to say. How could she judge what a mother did or didn’t do when she herself had never been one?

Mara went on. “I went back to work two weeks after he was born. We were about to push a new model. The program was so close to passing for human in everything it created that we had to give it harder problems. We asked it to write pages that could make you cry for a person who didn’t exist. It learned to do it. We fed it and fed it and taught it to eat very well. The night it first made something that made the whole room go silent, I thought I’d done the one thing I was meant to do. Then I went home and the baby cried for the next four hours.”

She pressed her fork into the yolk. It broke and ran until it formed a yellow lake around the toast. She didn’t lift it.

“I hired a nurse during the day. I memorized the sound of the bottle rotating under hot water. I learned how to sleep with one eye on the clock. I told myself this was a phase. I said the word *colic* to make my problem small enough to put in a pocket. The crying kept mapping my head. It learned my weak places. It sat on the beam that holds up the roof. It hung on the doorjamb and watched me pace. It knew when to start the minute I opened my laptop. I envied the machine, because it asked me for nothing except what I liked to give. The baby asked me for everything I didn’t have.”

The monitor woke and began to call again. Not loud, but startling enough to make the hairs on Kat’s forearms lift. The note rose, fell, rose again, like a hand knocking and then knocking harder because surely someone was there. Mara didn’t turn it off this time. She wrapped both hands around the device as if warming them on a hot coal. She kept talking. Her voice and the cry braided in the air until it was impossible to hear where one ended.

“I had the night,” she said, “the last night before launch. Papers and checklists and code and the feeling that you’re riding a wave that will not repeat itself. The nanny left at nine. He cried at nine fifteen. I let him, and I didn’t die. I even put on my airpods and played music real loud. But slowly the crying scratched its way into my ears, and I found it harder and harder to keep ignoring it. He was still crying by ten, and I almost vomited from the way my nerves made my stomach kick. There was so much work to be done. I stood over the crib and felt the weight of my own hands. I lifted him, and he went quiet, but his body was telling me the truth. He needed. There was no way to object. He was so ordinary in his need that it felt like I was drowning in tap water.”

Her eyes unfocused as if the far wall had turned into a painting, sharing with her the secrets of the human condition, of her own soul. “I set him down in his crib and went back to the table. I couldn’t spend another hour trying to figure out what he needed. Food, probably. And if he was alive then, he’d be alive after the hour that I needed to finish this thing.”

The crying from the monitor lifted a half step. The blue eye glowed steady now, a cold and bitter stare.

“But there was no way I was going to finish that project,” she said through gritted teeth. Mara threw down her fork suddenly, making Kat jump in her seat. She leaned back and looked up to the ceiling, looking for *why*. “I put the pillow over him,” she said quietly. “I told myself I was doing him a favor. I told myself I didn’t have it in me to do this, and better to die than live a miserable life with me. He’d be with Jesus now, my mother would say. But another part told me I’d feel the edge where the choice changed to a mistake, and I could just relax my hand upon the pillow the moment I felt that regret. It wasn’t over yet. I still had a chance to change my mind.”

Kat felt a rising swell of anger, though she fought hard to press it back down. *I’m not going to judge*, she thought. *I’m not going to judge*. *I can’t judge*. But the objections clawed their way into her mind. She was leaning in closer now and didn’t want to ask what happened. Because she knew.

“So I kept pressing down,” continued Mara. “He kicked. Not with the panic you see in movies. With one trusting movement of a soul who expects to be helped and quickly realizes help isn’t coming. I remember the hands shaking, but the shaking didn’t make me stop. I pressed and waited for myself to become someone else so I could blame her later. I pressed and learned that I really was the person who did it.”

The monitor’s cry softened as Mara slid it into her purse and levered the leather down on it with the heel of her hand. She looked at the bundle tenderly as she slowly kneaded it like dough, massaged her guilt into its folds. The crying sounded distant, like it came through walls, then even that throb went thin. It didn’t die. It sank to a depth where it could wait to be heard.

Mara looked at Kat. The diner narrowed to a box containing only their table and the space between them.

“How could you?” Kat asked. Her voice came out low and gravelly, and she couldn’t tell if it was anger or grief that made the grit.

“I killed him,” Mara said. “I killed him.” The syllables landed with the weight of truth. No plea in them. No lesson. Only fact.

“It was a child,” Kat said, her voice rising. “A human like you. How could you?”

“Because I’m a human like him,” Mara said, and heat flushed up her neck. “And who are you, anyway? Who are you to judge me? And who cares what you think? It was *my* life. What are you, some kind of trad wife in an apron with nothing to do but be gentle and say, *yes, dear*, when your husband wants you to pop out another baby? When you need to just sit around and… produce!”

“I’ve never been married,” Kat stammered, standing up slowly. “So, no. I’m not any of those things. But I know what what it means to choose to do what’s right, to give up a little of yourself to–“

“No!” Mara slammed her fists on the table. “Damn it, you don’t know anything! Unless it was you. Unless it was your mind driven insane. Unless it was your life. Then you don’t know.” Her voice swung hard into fury, looking for a wall to break its head against. Her hand closed around the sugar dispenser. The cheap glass had thickness enough to bruise. The metal collar glinted under the diner lights. She dragged the crying monitor out of the purse, placed it on the table, and brought the dispenser down on it. The first blow cracked the shell. The second split it. The third sent red wires curling like opened veins. “Shut up,” she said through gritted teeth. “Shut up. Shut up! SHUT. UP.”

Sugar rattled into the cavity and poured across the table. The crying cut out. The silence that replaced it stiffened the air. Kat stared at the woman in disbelief. She was having some kind of mental breakdown right in front of her, right in this diner, but what was she supposed to do? She looked around and saw that no one else seemed to care about the scene unfolding in front of her.

Mara’s face collapsed, and she looked at the remains of the baby monitor, as if it wasn’t her who smashed it to bits. “I want forgiveness,” she whispered. “I want him back. I’ll do anything.”

“Will you?” said Kat, her eyes narrowing. “You should be careful what you wish for.”

The storm gathered its shoulders outside. Lightning wrote a line on the horizon and then erased it. The picture window took the night on like a mask. The jukebox lost its song as the diner lights blinked in and out, found static, and then found a smaller voice underneath the static, the sound you hear on an empty frequency when something insists on using the wire anyway.

The red selection numbers clicked left to right as if an invisible finger was testing each one for a secret trigger. The tiny bulbs flared and dimmed in a loop. The sound in the box took on shape. It grew a throat. It cried, a long baby’s cry that wailed above the diner’s noises.

Mara lifted her face to the jukebox as if the machine had called her by name. She rose from the booth and nearly knocked the table aside, coffee rocking to the rim and over, liquid cresting in a black tide. Then she stared at the glass because the sound filled even the window. The reflection of the street shifted as if a layer had been wiped away.

A woman crossed the circle of the streetlight outside. She wore a starched white uniform and a cap like a folded sail. The nurse held a posture that had learned to cut through long corridors without wasting time as she held a bundled shape in her arms. She approached the glass and smiled with the kind of smile you see in black and white photographs, where even the shadows look polished. Her lips moved. The voice found Kat and Mara both from nowhere and everywhere.

“Congratulations, Mrs. Bentori,” said the nurse, bright and professional and tender in equal measure. “It’s a beautiful baby boy.”

At first, the cry came out thin, then thicker. Mara was screaming, her face was full of rage and hatred. She grabbed the sugar dispenser again in one hand, with her other hand behind it to give it extra support. She used both arms to drive it through the window.

“Mara!” Kat cried out, as the dispenser struck with a heavy thud. The surface cracked in a perfect starburst from the point of impact. Threads ran to the edges like fractures in ice. The woman hit a second time, screaming, desperate to rid herself of the image of that nurse. The star grew bigger. Glass snowed inward in glints and fragments. The nurse didn’t flinch. She existed in every shard, like a choir of the same woman, arms full of the same bundle, mouth shaping the same sentence.

Mara screamed a third time. It stripped her voice to the wire and left her raw. She hit the glass again, even harder, the muscles in her arm bunching, her shoulder driving the blow. The glass finally gave, not neatly, but in an outward explosion that left glass teeth still rooted in the frame. The window opened to night.

With the last thrust, Mara’s own inertia pushed her through the glass as it fell apart, and as she collapsed, her body landed on a triangular blade that remained in the window’s frame. The fragment drove in deep and the woman gasped in surprise and pain. Blood flared out from beneath her. Her weight pushed down even farther, and suddenly her whole world turned to shards. Hands went out to the sidewalk and sank into thousands of fragments, piercing her palms and fingers.

Mara struggled through the opening, belly scraping on teeth. She made a sound that was low and guttural as she hauled one knee over the window frame, and the shard that lodged there tore free. She crawled through broken glass because the only direction that existed was away from the nurse still reflected in each piece of window that remained, away from the sound of her baby crying in the jukebox. She pulled herself along the walkway outside, crying as her legs dragged behind her and left a red smear that brightened in the lights outside.

Lightning burst again and froze the scene to white for a heartbeat. In that bright bruise of time, Kat saw everything at once. The glass glittering in Mara’s hair like salt. The trail of blood on cement. The nurse reflected a hundred times, each smile clean and impossible. The cries that kept coming from the jukebox.

Then the world unstuck. Thunder landed on the roof. The power dipped and came back. The jukebox found its old song and slid the needle into the groove. The picture window stood whole in its frame, slick with rain on the other side, unscratched on this one. The night outside was only night, with just a few remnants of a storm dissipating overhead.

Mara was gone. The circle of the streetlight stood empty. Beyond it, the darkness went on. There was no trail of blood. There was nothing to follow but the horrifying memory of the way she moved in those final moments.

Kat’s mouth tasted like old pennies. Her hands were open and empty. She looked down at the booth, almost believing it had been a dream but knowing in her soul it wasn’t. After all, the plate sat where it had been before, with the yolk congealed to a dull skin. Coffee had run and mapped its brown geography over the tabletop. The sugar lay in drifts where it had spilled, sparkling as if proud of how pretty it could be, and the dispenser it used to be in was nowhere to be seen. The monitor lay in two halves with red wires coiled like small, slick intestines, threaded with grains of sugar that clung to them.

A young girl called her name, asking for more napkins. Kat went to the counter to grab some. She passed the man with the newspaper, who was wrinkling his nose at a headline. In the kitchen, Manny swore at the fryer and shook the basket. The world continued without Mara. The world always had. She was as insignificant as the baby she destroyed, as Kat felt on this endless night.

Kat crossed back over to the booth and began to clean up. She slid the monitor pieces into a paper bag from the counter, along with a cracked coffee mug and the used napkins. When she wiped the rest up with a rag, she sat for one slow breath in the seat where Mara had been. The vinyl was still warm. She studied the window more closely, barely believing that it could look whole after being destroyed like that, but she saw it with her own eyes.

The jukebox picked another old song at random and offered it to the room. The first note was a low hum that could have been the beginning of anything. Kat waited through the second note before she stood. Only a song. Only a diner. Only a window, whole. The bell on the door rang again. She placed her rag in her apron pocket and turned to greet the next customer.",1,1762402937.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
