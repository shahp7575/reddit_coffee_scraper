I'm about to be be 21 in a few days, and being really honest it's just me and my bf here, and as much as it's totally ok it kinda feels a little lonely at the same time... 
don't get me wrong he gives me plenty of love, but I feel like after moving to a different part of the world with him, and kind of leaving everything behind, I feel lonely? 

Theres girlhood missing if there's any sense into this, sometimes I go and try to show my drawings or the stuff that im interested in, I try to get some gossip from him or something but it doesn't feel the same... is anyone feeling the same??? I can't be the only one...

It might be a curse like, hey if you settle with someone you love when you are young you'll find yourself friendless type shit 

I found myself overthinking the fact that I have 0 social reasons to make friends, I don't work, I don't study, I mostly stay at home and do my own thing and at some point all I think of is my girls and how bad I would love to have them here, cause social media is nothing when you literally have a 12h gap between you and them... 

How are we even supposed to make friends nowadays? 
And don't get me wrong but Dunedin is such a dead city to my eyes... I don't drink and I prefer to stay out of noisy spaces due to the fact that one of my ears popped a few years ago, so like do I even really fit in here ,-, 

I want to meet some cool girls and go out for coffee, and have some life again, but it just feels impossible..

It feels extra hard, cause I've been here for a year and besides my bf and my landlord I know a total of 0 people and that is fk depressing üíÄ‚úä 

So ye bitches, I might as well just fill an application at this point and wait for any girly to adopt me üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è‚úä jkjk

i notice that if i go to sleep at 12 in the night and wake up at 9 or even 8 in the morning, that i have huge trouble staying productive the whole day. i have trouble keeping my self productive and awake at the last few hours of work. 

Advantages i can think of:
- im a night owl, so i can go to sleep later. This also aligns very well with the weekends, often friends come and we play like until 2 to 4 in the night. so doing all of this means my sleep schedule in the weekend and the work week stays more consistent
- I no longer feel extremely tired at the end of the day, and have no trouble staying awake once i get home.
- I have more energy during the day, and feel well more rested.
- It Feels more natural to me
- I have a lot more energy in the night time to do stuff at home

the only disadvantage is that i take a bit longer to wake up.

so, basically how i now kinda do it and plan to keep doing

- wake up at 9 in the morning
- go to work a hour later
- then, i come home at around 5 to 6 at the end of the day
- then i sleep for x hours. this can be 2, and also a max of 4. i set my clock to allow a max of 4 hours sleep to prevent over sleeping. i try to naturally wake up, but if i am so exhausted, i allow myself a max of 4 hours
- then, around 9 to 10, i get up, take some coffee since i need it to wake up my reptile brain, i make some food, watch some TV and play some games
- around 2 to 3 in the night, i go back to sleep again.
- wake up at 9 in the morning and rinse and repeat.

sleeping in one single go and staying awake and productive is impossible for me.

*July 23, 2025 ‚Äî Nationals Park*

The Cincinnati Reds (52-48) and Washington Nationals (39-60) collide in a matchup that‚Äôs less ‚Äúthriller‚Äù and more ‚Äúwhy are we still watching this?‚Äù The Reds, armed with a 3.88 ERA and a moneyline implied probability of \~58% (per FanDuel‚Äôs 1.72 odds), are the clear favorites. The Nationals? They‚Äôre the baseball version of a sieve, with a 5.24 ERA and a WHIP (1.410) that makes their pitchers look like they‚Äôre throwing water balloons, not fastballs. Let‚Äôs dive into the numbers, because this one‚Äôs a snoozer.

**Parse the Odds: Reds Are the Smart Money**  
The Reds‚Äô 22-19 record in games they‚Äôve been favored on the moneyline this season isn‚Äôt just luck‚Äîit‚Äôs math. Their 3.88 ERA is 1.36 runs *better* than the Nationals‚Äô 5.24, a gap so wide you could fit the entire Washington rotation in it. Brady Singer, Cincinnati‚Äôs starter (4.32 ERA, 92 Ks in 100‚Öî IP), is a steadier bet than a Vegas slot machine. Meanwhile, Jake Irvin (4.58 ERA, 2.18 K/BB ratio) is like a guy who ‚Äúkinda knows how to pitch‚Äù but occasionally forgets to bring his game face.

The moneyline odds (Reds -150, Nationals +130 in American terms) imply the Nationals have a 43% chance to win. But let‚Äôs be real: Their offense relies on hope, their bullpen is a Russian nesting doll of ‚Äúwho‚Äôs worse this time?‚Äù and their defense looks like a group of kindergarteners playing ‚Äúlet‚Äôs pretend we‚Äôre fielding.‚Äù

**Digest the News: Nationals Are Baseball‚Äôs Version of a Leaky Faucet**  
No major injury updates here, but the Nationals‚Äô season is a masterclass in how *not* to build a team. Their 1.410 WHIP means opponents are scoring like they‚Äôre on a coffee break at a bakery. Key Nationals hitters like C.J.

1m6ljds,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1m6ljds/indoor_male_cat_keeps_peeing_on_beds_and_furniture/,Indoor male cat keeps peeing on beds and furniture,"Hi everyone,  
I‚Äôm looking for advice or to hear from anyone who‚Äôs been through something similar.

I have a neutered male indoor cat (he just turned 2) who‚Äôs been peeing outside the litter box on and off for around a year now. It started with the sofa, which he peed on multiple times. We took him to the vet, and they gave him antibiotics for a suspected UTI, but they didn‚Äôt do any tests at the time. We took away the sofa for about 4 months trying to get rid of the urine smell with enzyme cleaner and kept it in a spare room, but as soon as we put it back in the living room (around November 24) he peed on it again so we got rid of it completely (also took him back to the vet and he got given antibiotics again). In those 4 months the couch was in the spare room he only used the cat toilet.

About 2 months ago my roommate had a visitor for a week. We're not very sociable people so this was the first time someone had come to stay for longer than a few hours (when someone comes over for a few hours he hides the entire time), and he started peeing on our coffee table. Our modem is on that table and can't really be moved so I cleaned it up and put a bag on top of the modem in case he did it again ‚Äî and he did, about 4 times in 2 days until I moved the table and made the modem inaccessible. This is when I bought Feliway and also hoped it would stop when the visitor left (I didn‚Äôt take him to the vet this time as I thought it was territorial behavior, and it did stop when the guest left).

Now 2 months later he peed on my roommate's bed last Thursday, mine on the Friday, and my roommate‚Äôs twice more over the weekend. He also peed in one of their scratchpad beds.

We currently have two litter boxes that are scooped daily, no lids. One of them gets used a lot and the other one goes basically untouched. I‚Äôve cleaned the accidents thoroughly with enzyme cleaners each time. We have a Feliway diffuser in the main living room.

He now gets at least one leash walk a day for 20 minutes or more, sometimes even twice. Despite this, the problem hasn‚Äôt gone away. Even after his walk, he‚Äôll still spend hours meowing at the door to go out again.

I‚Äôm starting to feel like maybe he just isn‚Äôt suited to being indoors, but I‚Äôm really scared of making him an outdoor cat. I live in Norway, and our apartment has only a front door that opens into a hallway separate from the main living space. It‚Äôs hard to hear anything from the living room, and both me and my roommate are gamers who wear headsets for long stretches, so I worry we wouldn‚Äôt hear him meowing to be let back in.

I‚Äôm planning to call the vet tomorrow to ask about doing full testing this time like a urine sample, bloodwork or possibly imaging, but I‚Äôm also nervous about the cost, especially living in Norway. If anyone here has gone through this with their cat and had tests done, I‚Äôd really appreciate a rough idea of what it cost you.

I love him and I want to help him, but this is becoming really difficult and stressful for both me and my roommate. I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything I can think of, and I just don‚Äôt know what else to do.

**TLDR**  
Indoor male cat has been peeing on furniture and beds on and off for over a year despite vet visits, clean litter boxes, and daily leash walks. Still begs to go out constantly and keeps peeing inside. I‚Äôm afraid of making him an outdoor cat due to our apartment setup. Planning to get vet tests done but nervous about cost in Norway. Any advice or similar experiences appreciated.

1m6lhjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m6lhjl/does_simpure_replacement_water_filter_improve/,Does SimPure Replacement Water Filter Improve Water Quality? Comprehensive Review for Y7/Y7P Systems,"Using the SimPure ROULP-2012-100-Y7 replacement cartridge in my daily setup for the SimPure Y7 series countertop water filtration system has been quite the journey. Diving into every feature and putting this product to the test unearthed some genuinely noteworthy aspects, though a couple of considerations linger in the back of my mind. Let me walk you through my experience with this product.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me was the compact and sleek design of this replacement filter. It‚Äôs crafted from carbon fiber, making it lightweight yet durable at just 14.39 ounces. The dimensions‚Äî12.32 x 4.53 x 2.83 inches‚Äîhighlight its smart, space-saving build. It doesn't feel flimsy or cheap in any way, and trust me, having accidentally dropped it once, I can vouch for its sturdiness. The twist-in mechanism for replacing filters is an absolute win. I replaced it in under two minutes without needing any tools, leaving me wondering why all systems don‚Äôt adopt such simplicity.

**Performance and Filtration Efficiency**  
Impressively, this filter claims a 100 GPD (gallons per day) capacity. After a week of consistent use, I noticed a distinct improvement in taste and clarity of water. I tested it with tap water that‚Äôs fairly hard in my area. It removed most of the impurities‚ÄîI even noticed significantly reduced limescale buildup in my coffee machine. The six-month replacement cycle suggested by the RO smart indicator light aligns perfectly with my usage. That said, usage interval could vary based on your water quality. While I didn‚Äôt scientifically test its claims, my trust grew from the consistent output quality.

[Don‚Äôt wait‚Äîcheck SimPure ROULP-2012-100-Y7 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0bgl2tpbz/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Tool-free, quick-change twist-in system saves time and hassle.  
- Effectively reduces impurities and contaminants to enhance water quality.  
- Lightweight and compact, perfect for smaller spaces.  

**Areas of Improvement**  
If I‚Äôm being honest, no product is without its flaws.  
- Exclusivity‚Äîthis filter only works with the SimPure Y7 series. It might disappoint anyone looking for a versatile solution adaptable to other filtration systems.  
- The six-month replacement indicator is a helpful feature but feels arbitrary. If you have heavily polluted water, the cycle durations could feel shorter than expected.  
- Lastly, the price point might feel premium to some users when considering regular replacements.

**Installation and User Friendliness**  
The installation process couldn‚Äôt possibly get easier. I handed it over to my 75-year-old dad to see how uncomplicated it really is. He had it installed in no time without looking at the manual! The twist-lock makes maintenance simple, and I didn‚Äôt need to worry about bringing out a toolbox or deciphering any complex instructions.  

**Competing Products**  
In the realm of countertop filtration, several products compete with the SimPure system. Filters like APEC‚Äôs countertop RO system offer good quality too but lack the tool-free replacement feature, which is a time saver in this case. On the other hand, Aquasana‚Äôs models are appreciated for their environmental approach but are bulkier and not as sleek. SimPure holds an edge for its compact design and ease of maintenance, but others might outpace it in terms of broader compatibility.

**Price Worthiness**  
Comparing its replacement cycle and performance with similar products in the market, this filter hovers somewhere in the middle ground. Its thin compatibility to only certain models might seem restrictive, yet the water quality improvements are substantial enough to justify its value. If simplicity matters to you alongside consistent filtration, it feels like a logical purchase, even if it's not the cheapest solution out there.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of birthday gifts can bring up many questions.Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions regarding birthday gifts for your wife to guide your choice.

**What if my wife already has everything she needs?**
Focus on experiences rather than material possessions. A cooking class, a weekend getaway, or tickets to a concert can be more memorable than yet another item to clutter her space. Alternatively, consider a donation to her favorite charity in her name.

**How much should I spend on a birthday gift for my wife?**

**Is it okay to ask my wife what she wants?**
Absolutely! While some prefer the element of surprise, others appreciate being consulted, especially when it comes to larger or more practical gifts. Asking her directly ensures that you're getting her something she genuinely desires and avoids the risk of giving her something she won't use.

**What if she seems uninterested in material gifts?**
Consider acts of service as a gift. Offer to take over some of her chores for a week, plan a romantic picnic, or simply dedicate an evening to spending quality time together. Actions frequently enough speak louder than words.

1m6l84b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passport_Bros/comments/1m6l84b/6_days_solo_in_prague_with_no_dating_apps/,"6 Days Solo in Prague with no dating apps; observations, girls and nightlife.","‚∏ª
My background I am in my mid to late twenties, ethically ambitious and from the UK. I‚Äôm very average in the face, extremely frugal with my money but I do believe that men should pay on dates. This isn‚Äôt a big deal as Prague is one of the cheapest capitals cities in Europe. My pros are - I dress well, Im funny and if you squint hard enough I have athletic looking body which is an improvement for a former fatty. I am in no way Henry Cavill or Michael B Jordan. 

Context on the trip: even though I am travelling solo. I‚Äôve been to Prague 9 or 10 times. I have friends who live here and actually find dating apps a slow waste of time in such a socialable city. Everyone under 30 speaks English and it is a transplant city made up on lots of young single people who like the cheap living costs and nightlife. 

Wednesday: 

I landed in Prague at 2 PM after a delayed flight from the UK. 

I have a late lunch with my friend who is a DJ and runs a bar crawl that gets hostels involved. He tells me to come to one of his bar crawls. 

He leaves and it‚Äôs solo day-game time. 

Girl 1 Lenka üá®üáø. ‚Äì she was sitting outside at a caf√© reading a book. She was wearing very modest clothing but had a really pretty face. I simply asked if she spoke English and knew where I could get some pho. She told me all the places and that started a conversation. We swapped IGs. She wasn‚Äôt comfortable with swapping numbers as she had a complex about men who only visit Prague temporarily. It‚Äôs such a tourist hub that she doesn‚Äôt see the point in investing time into someone who‚Äôs leaving in 6 days. Usually being in somewhere temporarily is an advantage as it gives a deadline for a girl to seize the moment with you. Not in this case. We had a great conversation for 25 mins until she had to go to her research session [idk what to call it but she was doing a PHD at the university ]. 

Girl 2 AirPods - While talking to my Airbnb I spotted a girl sat by herself with headphones in. I started speaking to her and she looked annoyed at having to remove her headphones to hear me. I knew while talking that I was a bumbling idiot with this approach. She politely said ‚ÄúI have a boyfriend‚Äù sorry. She probably didn‚Äôt but I was so bad that I actually appreciated the kindness of this rejection. 

I checked into my Airbnb, showered, charged my phone and needed to buy toothpaste so headed to Tesco. 

Outside the shops I saw a group of 3 girls. One in particular was stunning. If I was at home I probably would approach whoever I felt liked me the most but there‚Äôs something about Prague which gives me unbelievable confidence. 

Girl 3 üá∫üá¶slim blonde ‚Äì I approached a group of 3 girls. 2 from Ukraine, 1 from Belarus. 

All 3 girls were attractive but the blonde Ukrainian looked like something out of a movie. She was tall, slim, had piercing blue eyes, dressed expensively and carried herself with such a feminine energy. 

I asked the ‚ÄúExcuse me do you speak English? I‚Äôm looking for the spinning head.‚Äù For context - there‚Äôs a great moving art installation in Prague called the Franz Kafka head. I‚Äôve seen it a million times. I know how to get there. My vague explanation of it is a conversation starter. One girl didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about, the other girl laughed and explained to her friend what I was talking about and this started a friendly conversation between the 3 of us. The one I was the most attracted to did not engage. In fact she was frowning the whole time and looked so uninterested every time I spoke. I had two options, show interest in the friends who showed interest in conversation with me or go all out for the stunning one. I had to commit to one. I gambled. 

‚ÄúYour friend seems really annoyed I‚Äôm here haha, it‚Äôs a shame because I was going to ask her a really personal question‚Äù [I had no question]. 

‚ÄúWhat question?‚Äù She asked 

‚ÄúNo no it‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôll stop bothering you‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo tell me‚Äù. Her friends started laughing and she started to leave her cold persona and started seeking approval. 

Long story short I got her IG/number and we all said goodbye. 

High off the back of this interaction, I was on untouchable confidence and walked blindly into a metaphorical carcrash next. 

Girl 4 invisible man - I approached a two girls ethnically looked some sort of Asian and wow. They walked past me like I was invisible. Humiliating blow out. 

After cooking myself dinner, I enjoy a night in alone watching a film. 

Thursday Day:
I texted the Ukrainian girl, Daryna (Girl 3) and she was WAY more open and really fun. I deliberately don‚Äôt push for a meet up. Just build rapport. 

I DMed Lenka (Girl 1) and ask about where to get Pho in the old town. 

I meet up with more friends. 

Thursday evening: 
Checked out Letn√° Park and the Stalin monument rave. It was little party on a very high hill in a public park with a DJ and bar. I was invited by my friends who knew the city. There were 4 of us. We danced with/spoke to two friends from Germany (Girl 5). One significantly more attractive than the other. We all swap IGs. The attractive girl seemed to be way more into my friend so I do the honourable thing and talk with the other girl. they invite us to some rave that‚Äôll be happening after I leave. 

On the way back I get a ‚Ç¨30 fine on the tram for travelling without a ticket. Idiot. 

Friday (day):
Explored the city solo. I went to a gallery, checked out the Museum of Communism. I meet up with Ukrainian blonde Daryna (Girl 3) for a late lunch. I don‚Äôt understand the hard faced bitch attitude she was doing with her friends. It was a completely different person now. She was bubbly, flirty and asked so many questions about me. She moved to Prague when she was 18 as a student way before the war. She knew a lot about British RnB and we spoke mainly about music and family. She had obsession with me being a ‚Äòplayer‚Äô and kept asking how many girls I approached in Prague or how often I do that. I never lied but I also never gave a direct answer. I just simply repeated ‚Äúyou had an energy and I knew we would get on even when your friends were talking to me more‚Äù. We exchanged a kiss on the cheek and left the lunch. 

Friday night:
Joined a bar crawl. Mostly Americans, Aussies, Irish and Brits. I spent most of the crawl speaking to a girl (Girl 6) from Italy. We kissed and swapped /IG/numbers but we ended up losing each other is the swarm of bar crawl goers moving from place to place. I text her the next morning and I‚Äôve had no reply since. The last stop on the crawl was a place called EPIC a big boring techno club. I text the Ukrainian girl while I was there asking if she was out. She was having drinks with the girls and we met up for a walk and then ended up going back to my Airbnb. I can‚Äôt explain how this woman looked when her dress slid off. It was like something out of a Victoria Secret show. European women and the maintenance of their bodies should be studied. Great night. 

Saturday (day):

Girl 6 2006 - While I was at an ATM I was approached by a girl in leggings with the brightest eyes. She was young, very slim but you could see her ass from the front. Great combo. She started speaking to me in Czech and I just looked confused. She then started speaking in English and said ‚Äúif you were a book I‚Äôd read you every day‚Äù.  I could see her friends in the background smiling and laughing. I wasn‚Äôt sure if this was some sort of dare but I smile and simply say thank you. Her friends come over and insist that me and her follow each other on Instagram. Oh, ok this is real and I‚Äôm being approached. I ask how old she is. She says I‚Äôm 18. I inform her that I‚Äôm old enough to be her dad (idk why I said that - I‚Äôm 9 years older) and decline. I tell them they all seem fun and I hope they have a great time. 

I hate that I liked her body. Straight to jail. Do not pass go ‚õîÔ∏è. 

I know some people will be like ‚Äú18 is an adult etc etc‚Äù. It‚Äôs just too young for me personally and if I‚Äôm honest I‚Äôm not completely sure I believed her. 

Saturday night:

Hit a karaoke bar, then a live music venue called Dogbar. Had a really good night with my friends. Had some interaction at the bar but nothing to write home about. Just a great night with friends. 

Sunday:

I slept all morning. Eventually getting out of bed at 13:00. I am no longer a 21 year old uni student and cannot party like I used to. I had arranged to meet up with Lenka (Girl 1) that afternoon.

Back to Letn√°/Stalin park. Good place to relax and people-watch, met up with Lenka üá®üáø (Girl 1) and we had a long walk around the park. Other than the odd coffee kiosk. Everything in Europe is CLOSED on Sunday so it‚Äôs the perfect time to arrange simple dates. We went for pho and she is genuinely one of the smartest people I‚Äôve ever met. She was amazing and ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô in a sense however she was not submissive in any way and was studying to be a doctor. She dressed up way more sexy than she had when I met her. She clearly wanted to show off a bit more of her figure with a crop top. We both say our goodbyes and agree to meet up when I‚Äôm in the UK and try to squeeze in another date before I leave Prague. 

Monday Day:

At this point the only girls I‚Äôve been consistently texting are Lenka üá®üáø (Girl 1) and Daryna (üá∫üá¶Girl 2). I get along with Girl 1 more and she is probably more of a long term wife type but Girl 2 is also very much a wife type and is genuinely one of the hottest women I have ever seen. 

Day game time:  

Girl 7 üé∏: I speak to a pretty Czech girl outside the Palladium (a shopping mall) she was wearing a band t shirt and some combat pants. She was with a much younger girl. Her makeup is very alternative looking. I ask for directions, we get into conversation. When it comes to closing - ‚ÄúI have a boyfriend‚Äù. Rejection. 

Girl 8 Brazil üáßüá∑ ‚è≥: this one was a cheat code. Years ago on hinge I matched with a Brazilian girl who was living in Portugal but visiting Prague. We spoke, we exchanged videos, we did everything but meet up due to bad timing. I recognise her, she does not recognise me but after reminding, I see a big beaming smile on her face and she bursts out laughing. I tell her I‚Äôm going to text her later. This girl is fucking beautiful. 5‚Äô3, caramel skin and shaped like an hourglass. You know some IG stories you see and ALWAYS have to click on? Her consist of her in bikinis all year round or at some sort of dance class in matching gym sets. 

Girl 9 Liverpool girls: I see a group of girls that are distinctively northern English or Irish. Anyone from England or Ireland knows exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. We chat, we exchange info but nothing ever comes of this. 

Monday night: 

Date with Lenka. We meet up for drinks and to celebrate some academic milestone she‚Äôs having. She‚Äôs wearing a dress and has the most incredible breasts. This is the third time I‚Äôve met her and these were hidden very well until now. We have a great date and we go back to hers. We watch Before Sunrise on a laptop on her bed for about 20 mins until we start kissing and then eventually fucking. Her body reminds me of Margery Qualley in her nude scenes in The Substance. 

As an aside when you spend time in Central Europe, what you consider to be ‚Äòslim‚Äô or ‚Äòaverage‚Äô is very warped. Especially when you come from the UK. The average sized woman in the UK would be considered ‚Äòfat‚Äô by Euro standards. 

I get a bolt back to my airbnb. She seems very offended by this. Great night. 

Tuesday day:

- I wake up to a text from Lenka üá®üáø (Girl 1) quite annoyed that I didn‚Äôt stay the night and that it made her feel used. It was quite sensitive especially when she‚Äôd expressed her insecurities about going on dates with someone temporarily in Prague. I agree and apologise. 
- Daryna (Girl 2) üá∫üá¶isn‚Äôt free again for the rest of my time here but wants to visit London and asks if I can help arrange that. I don‚Äôt live anywhere near London but I know the city well would love to show her the city and agree. 
- I also wake up to a nude from the Brazilian (Girl 8). 

Tuesday evening:

Back to Dogbar with a friend. It‚Äôs much nicer tonight. The weekend crowd absolutely packed this place. The midweek vibe is much nicer and I can move around. 

I send the Brazilian (Girl 8) the *wyd* text and she messes me around. First insists I come meet her and her friends at a bar. Then goes silent. Then says I can‚Äôt see her until she‚Äôs taken on a date. For context I‚Äôve seen every inch of this girl‚Äôs body and videos of her sucking her own toys. I‚Äôm unsure why she‚Äôs trying to tease or play hard to get but I start to get wound up. My friend tells me to ignore her texts and she‚Äôll come around. He was right. 2 hours after leaving her on read I get a text from her asking if I‚Äôm in a hostel or a hotel. I tell her I‚Äôm in an Airbnb 5 min walk from the club she‚Äôs at. 

I‚Äôd like to give myself credit however anyone familiar with Dogbar will tell you that there is 0 phone signal in there and you can only receive/send texts when you are outside. This helped me not cave into pressure and wait out her texts. 

I get a Bolt car and the Brazilian girl meets me outside the club she was at. We go back to mine and film ourselves doing all the things we said we would do in 2023. 

And that was my last night in Prague until 2026. 

The next morning I packed up my things and hopped on a train to Germany to see some friends ahead of wedding this weekend. 

‚∏ª

Disclaimers: I know this might read a little scattered ‚Äî I was jotting it down in my notes app day by day.

TLDR Summary:
My first time in Prague was in 2018 as a teenager. Since then, I‚Äôve been back nine times. It‚Äôs changed. Between 2019 and 2023, there was a golden window where women outnumbered men in bars and clubs. That‚Äôs flipped. Now, it feels like a 4:1 guy-to-girl ratio in nightlife.

If you‚Äôre looking for a wife, something long-term or serious, Prague might not be the place. But if you‚Äôre trying to build confidence and get used to talking to women, it‚Äôs still an amazing city for that. Everyone there is from different parts of the planet so you‚Äôll always be considered interesting to women. You‚Äôre likely to have some success ‚Äî just know the scene has shifted.

I‚Äôm a massive hypocrite as I do not think hookup culture is healthy for anyone but when I am in Prague I find it very easy to slip into that habit. It‚Äôs a great city for building confidence as I feel that‚Äôs what has made me comfortable approaching women cold.

1m6l7nc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m6l7nc,Nice upgrades :3,"So this year started the espresso thing, and posted my humble set up (first pic), and while it wasn't able to produce legit espresso, it hooked me into getting better stuff. 

I think I found a very comfy place to be, with the Delonghi machine, and my Ascaso I1 grinder. I upgraded somethings on the Delonghi: a better screen, longer milk frother, new and modded OPV valve, and a proper fine convex basket. 

I modded my Ascaso grinder, added inner noise vibration and sound dampening, modified grinding chamber exit and chute to lower retention, coming from 2-3g stuck to zero-ish 90% ot the time. Some other times it's .1 or less. 

Got all the needed tools, nothing fancy (I joke showing my tamper being a PUSEE), even puck screens from Temu. 

At the end, coffe now is able to show off details, and my fiance is excited every time I offer to make some coffees, as I try and get better with my latte art.

1m6l7fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1m6l7fa/severe_vomiting_dehydration_sent_me_to_er/,Severe vomiting dehydration sent me to ER,"I (34f) started zepbound four months ago and went up in dose only once, a month in. I had experienced nausea before this and have been careful with what and how much I eat to avoid it, so in the days leading up to this I hadn't eaten much. 

Though I didn't do anything out of the ordinary I started feeling worse and worse throughout the day until around 5pm I had to go lay down at home. I decided food might help so I attempted to eat a meal shake and immediately vomited it up. I threw up a few more times and eventually fell asleep. All I had for nausea was zofran.

The next morning I didn't feel well enough to drive my kids to school. I threw up all day long. I tried water, Gatorade, ice chips, but eventually nothing stayed down. Especially not any medicine. This worsened through the day as my vomit went from clear fluids, to green bile, and eventually I was throwing up brown coffee grounds, which it turns out is old blood. 

Luckily at this point I was no longer alone and my spouse decided I needed to be brought to the hospital. Triage gave me more zofran which didn't help. 
Once there I was still vomiting. At this point I had other symptoms like confusion and I was wobbly walking myself.  I finally got some fluids in my room and was able to stop vomiting briefly. 

Once with the doctor and after all tests, and a CT scan, they found no internal bleeding or anything needing surgery. Basically, what happened is my vomiting was so severe that my stomach acid tore up both my esophagus and throat until they were bleeding. It was incredibly painful. Instructions for healing included reglan, rehydration, rest and absolutely staying indoors for the next 3 days. (To avoid heat) 

Unfortunately, I didn't do much better at home and still couldn't keep fluids or medicine down.

Next day, Started taking suppository phenergan which helped. Stopped vomiting, finally. My throat/esophagus were very painful especially attempting swallowing. So started a combo of Maalox and Viscous Lidocaine. My voice was gone. 

I spent 4 days basically bedridden, at this point it felt like a bad hangover with body and headache as well. 
By day 4 I finally felt less nauseous and more like an actual rest day. My voice returned but I still have some pain. I was also able to eat a few bites of food by now. I've otherwise been on a clear diet of broths and teas. 

I've also had other strange and awful symptoms like emotional outbursts, and extremely vivid hallucinatory dreams (we believe reglan did this one).

On day 5 now. It finally feels like I'm getting better, I feel somewhat human again. I am seeing a doctor, she just happened to be on vacation when this happened. So I haven't seen her yet. I'm still very much recovering. ",2,1753207207.0,Zepbound,2,1.0,False
1m6l7br,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1m6l7br/the_magic_happens_when_youre_bored_seriously/,The Magic Happens When You‚Äôre Bored (Seriously),"Hey everyone,

Ever start a project, side hustle, or goal super excited‚Ä¶ only to hit a point where it feels slow, repetitive, and honestly‚Ä¶ kinda boring? You‚Äôre not alone. That ""meh"" middle phase is where most people quit.

But here‚Äôs the truth:
‚úÖ Boring = Building.
‚úÖ Repetitive = Progress.
‚úÖ Slow = Strong.

Why?
Think of a tree:
You plant the seed (exciting!).
You see the first sprout (so cool!).
Then‚Ä¶ it just sits there growing roots underground for months. Boring. Invisible. But without roots, the tree falls over.

Your work is growing roots right now.

Why the ""boring phase"" is actually your superpower:

No Competition: Most people quit here. If you keep going, you automatically rise.

Skills Get Deep: Repeating small tasks turns you into an expert without you noticing.

Trust Builds: Showing up consistently (even quietly) makes people rely on you.

Real Foundations: Slow growth = strong, lasting results. Fast growth often crashes.

How to survive (and thrive) in the boring zone:

Track Tiny Wins: Write down 1 small win daily. (‚ÄúPosted Reel,‚Äù ‚ÄúEmailed 1 client,‚Äù ‚ÄúRead 5 pages‚Äù).

Focus on Habits, Not Hype: Do your 10-20 min daily action ‚úÖ (see my last post!). Forget ‚Äúviral‚Äù or ‚Äúovernight success.‚Äù

Find the Quiet Joy: Notice little improvements. Your writing flows easier. You fix problems faster. That‚Äôs progress!

Connect with Your ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù: Remind yourself why you started. (‚ÄúFreedom?‚Äù ‚ÄúHelping others?‚Äù ‚ÄúBuilding something yours?‚Äù). Write it down. Stick it up.

Celebrate Showing Up: Reward yourself for consistency, not just big results. (Example: ‚Äú7 days in a row? I deserve that fancy coffee!‚Äù).

Remember:
üî• Excitement starts things.
üå± Boring builds them.

Don‚Äôt quit when you can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù growth. Your roots are spreading. Your tree is coming.

Ever start a project, side hustle, or goal super excited‚Ä¶ only to hit a point where it feels slow, repetitive, and honestly‚Ä¶ kinda boring? You‚Äôre not alone. That ""meh"" middle phase is where most people quit.

But here‚Äôs the truth:
‚úÖ Boring = Building.
‚úÖ Repetitive = Progress.
‚úÖ Slow = Strong.

Why?
Think of a tree:
You plant the seed (exciting!).
You see the first sprout (so cool!).
Then‚Ä¶ it just sits there growing roots underground for months. Boring. Invisible. But without roots, the tree falls over.

Your work is growing roots right now.

Why the ""boring phase"" is actually your superpower:

No Competition: Most people quit here. If you keep going, you automatically rise.

Skills Get Deep: Repeating small tasks turns you into an expert without you noticing.

Trust Builds: Showing up consistently (even quietly) makes people rely on you.

Real Foundations: Slow growth = strong, lasting results. Fast growth often crashes.

How to survive (and thrive) in the boring zone:

Jonathan was suffering from success.

He had everything any academic in the world would have wanted: A limitless purview to study and research whatever he desired, the resources to try any experiment his mind could come up with, and near infinite time to accomplish it in. If you‚Äôd have asked him less than 6 months ago what his dream position would be, he would have described this job.

But now, now that he was here, the full freedom was trapping the scientist within the paralysis of choice. The sheer magnitude of the station he found himself in was suffocating, the feeling of wasting an opportunity, the desire, no, the *need* to take full advantage of such a privilege, was in of itself stopping him from doing so.

It had been five months, five months and Dr Johnathan Fletcher had nothing to show for his time here, not even the true start of a project outside of some vague notes and half started calculations, all for ideas nowhere near good enough. There was even a tray of blueberry muffins made in a fit of desperation and eaten long ago; they were‚Ä¶ ok. Not war winning.

The worst part was, nobody seemed to care. Aside from the occasional request for materials for whatever initial idea had struck his fancy, Jonathan only spoke with Susan during the monthly progress reports. Each of them stating functionally nothing had been accomplished, each one taken without complaint or issue, no sign of disappointment or suggestions of him not belonging here.

Of course, the fact of the matter was Johnathan was nothing special in this regard, and absolutely nobody in charge of Research Location 9 cared about his performance. Practically every scientist here had several months to find their new perfect project, most of them going through the same internal struggles and worries.

Unfortunately, that didn‚Äôt stop the self *perception* of Dr. Fletcher's abject failure, surrounded by brilliant people who were all working on cutting edge science straight out of the imaginations of magicians. That he, Dr Fletcher alone, was the single person failing and falling behind. This idea of isolated incompetence was, ironically, a very common feeling here.

So Johnathan continued to bash their head against the infinitely sized wall of trying to discover something incredible to work on, hoping each set of small experiments or tests would lead to something great.

He felt a little hope regarding his latest idea, as it had one he‚Äôd tinkered with on and off over the last 70 years. Out of all the known fundamental forces in the universe, XK waves were the least studied by humanity as a whole: the ability to influence electromagnetic forces at range wasn‚Äôt something that appeared on Earth naturally. In fact, having a species with a specialized organ in order to influence such forces was a rare trait amongst the universe as a whole.

In extreme cases, it allowed organisms to directly ‚Äúpuppeteer‚Äù organisms using their nervous system, read brain waves directly, and provide a level of supposed ‚Äòclairvoyance‚Äô and short term prediction through instinct. Unfortunately for the Terran Alliance, one of the main species of the Estorian empires were the Uhae, who were considered such an ‚Äòextreme case‚Äô. Humans being susceptible to being mind controlled was a military ‚Äòissue‚Äô on the battlefield.

Dr Fletcher was currently running simulations and calculations regarding the viability of a unique method of reversing such XK waves, nullifying them in all circumstances. The lab was mostly silent as Johnathan and Lena worked on this new theory, although internally Lena was facing an entirely different problem: What counts as ten percent?

That was the rule the Scythens had. They could, if they so chose, have dropped technology and scientific advancement upon their Terran allies to the extent that the war would have been quickly over. However from personal experience, they knew that just *dropping* information onto the less technologically advanced led to despair and ruin. The lessons learned from building and researching a technology were important, especially to avoid the pitfalls of usage.

The Scythens knew this all too well from personal experience.

Which was why they had the 10% rule. If you were working with a species and helping them apply research, you could get them 10% of the way there: a compromise between doing nothing, and accidentally accelerating a culture‚Äôs development fast enough for them to hurt themselves. Much discussion amongst the Scythens had been had around what exactly counted as 10%?

Did that count as telling his friend Johnathan that his current path of research wouldn‚Äôt work?

His idea was sound and the concept of blocking even the most powerful amplification of XK waves was entirely doable with the Terran‚Äôs level of technology, unfortunately, Friend Johnathan was about to fall for a common pitfall.

There were two main ways that species tried to block XK waves. One was slightly unconventional, but would work no matter what counter measures were deployed, a guaranteed block against such tricks. The other was more straightforward, but failed when the power of the incoming waves reached a certain limit. Even worse, by the rate of research it would take around two years of development to realize this pitfall.

It takes a discerning observer zero guesses to correctly summarize which method Johnthan had chosen.

So what counts as 10%? Is informing someone that a line of study won‚Äôt pan out too much interference, or should they instead let a friend waste literal years on a dead end? Lena couldn‚Äôt abide by that thought, so hoped that the small nudge they were about to give their Terran friend would be considered within the ‚Äòspirit‚Äô of the rules.

**‚ÄúQuery: Friend Johnathan, how are you feeling about this possible project proposal?‚Äù**

Lena asked the question carefully, not wanting to give away too much information. There was also the possibility that informing Dr Fletcher that their initial plan would have been yet another failure, would injure his already damaged confidence.

‚ÄúHuh? Oh yeah, I think this might finally be the one.‚Äù Jonathan looked up from his computer screen upon which numbers and results flashed by, startled from the break in silence. ‚ÄúThe initial simulations suggest that the science *might* work. Being able to cut off the Uhae‚Äôs ‚Äòcrazy powers‚Äô would be an amazing project.‚Äù

Lena paused once again, trying to craft the exact words needed to explain the situation without outright telling him that his current path is one of futility, that he needed a slight change to fully unlock his idea.

**‚ÄúQuestioning statement: Are you certain your method will work?‚Äù**

Jonathan stopped for a moment, giving a frown as he slowly thought over the statement.

‚ÄúWell, no reason why it shouldn‚Äôt work. The process by which the Uhae exert their control is known, and interfering with that process using my idea has already been proven in a lab to work on single wave events. No reason it shouldn‚Äôt scale to actual real implementation.‚Äù

Johnathan was wrong, it wouldn‚Äôt scale, not to the level it needed to, not that Lena was going to say it outright. They couldn‚Äôt just give the Terran all the answers either, they needed to prod the primate closer towards the actual answer.

**‚ÄúSuggestion: Why not use the Frazier Principle?‚Äù**

Johnathan narrowed his eyes slightly at his Scythen friend, staring at the strange tentacled alien sitting upon their floating transport disk. Johnathan, like most of his species, had the ability for ‚Äòpattern recognition‚Äô. Over his years of friendship with Lena, he‚Äôd noticed the prelude to some of his greatest moments of inspiration had been small innocuous comments like this, that always seemed to push him in the right direction.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that a process for a different wavelength? I guess you could theoretically modify it, and it *would* increase the potential gain if that became a problem‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dr Fletcher trailed off as his mind started to slip into deep thought, quickly putting together an initial set of simulations to run to test this new idea as the new theory started to take hold, Lena happy that they‚Äôd pushed their Terran friend in the right direction without specifically telling them what to do. Johnathan would still have to work out all the important parts, and learn the important lessons that came with those new sciences.

A soft gentle sounding alarm sounded through the lab, a sound all scientists at Research Location 9 had learned to hate, breaking the conversation and Johnathan‚Äôs train of thought as the lights on the lab brightened and several devices turned themselves to standby mode, including the terminal Johnathan had been furiously typing into.

**‚ÄúMaxium working time has been reached for this session. Please leave the lab Dr. Fletcher and Lena for a minimum of two hours. Thank you.‚Äù**

The voice belonged to MATILDA, the ever watching digital eyes of the AI that ran the facility. While Susan was in charge of the big picture stuff, making sure difficult to source resources were found and ensuring every scientist here had what they needed to be the best them, MATILDA ran the day to day necessities. They made sure the trash was taken away, food and entertainment was restocked, and that the scientific minds they were in charge of didn‚Äôt harm themselves.

‚ÄúJesus Christ MATILDA, I‚Äôve said I don‚Äôt need you to tell me when to take a break, I‚Äôm an adult, I don‚Äôt need a babysitter telling me when to stop.‚Äù

**‚ÄúAs I have stated before Dr Johnathan Fletcher, I am merely here to ensure your compliance with working time laws and keep you healthy. I am not a baby sitter. ‚Äù**

MATILDA was a babysitter. The Terran Alliance government had quickly learnt that if you gave academics infinite resources to work on something they find interesting, a large percentage of them tended to turn into educationally focused hermits that forget about things like food and sunlight. This, despite the protests of the scientists themselves, was bad for both their health and productivity.

Thus, it was MATILDA‚Äôs job to ensure that their charges remembered to eat, and get the socialization, or ‚Äògrass touching‚Äô required to be a healthy adult. Not to mention all the other childish issues academics bring with them; like continuing previous academic spats by trying to break into other's labs and getting into near fistfights over different theories. One academic had even been expelled from the program after they couldn't let a three decades old feud go. Shortly followed by their colleague for throwing what they called ‚Äúmy ultimate victory party.‚Äù

Indeed, MATILDA had to deal with the unfortunate reality that education didn‚Äôt equal maturity. Not that most of the people here at Research Location 9 knew of this. To them, the poor AI was an annoying caretaker, who made them take regular breaks, and stopped them bringing food or sleeping bags into the lab.

**‚ÄúReminder: We did agree to lunch with Rux and Spencer.‚Äù**

Johnathan's annoyance with being kicked out of the lab was interrupted by Lena, turning to a mild panic as they checked the time, realizing they'd let the minutes tick away faster than expected.

‚ÄúShit it's two already. Gonna be late again!‚Äù

MATILDA was instantly forgotten as Dr Fletcher quickly gathered his belongings, and with a last glance to make sure his simulations were still running, rushed out of the door with the Scythen close in tow.

**‚ÄúYes, goodbye to you as well, Dr Johnathan Fletcher and Lena.‚Äù** The voice of MATILDA had an annoyed tint to it as it called out after the pair, adding a final word after a moment's delay. **‚ÄúRude.‚Äù**

The duo jumped into one of the many transport pods that allowed quick travel around the facility, quickly picking up speed as they sped past the rows upon rows of labs. The sounds and signs of movement could be seen within each, as the greatest minds of the Terran Alliance all worked together on their own projects.

It was an additional reminder to Jonathan of the complete lack of progress he'd made so far, increasing the incessant and unrequired guilt of not being good enough for such a place.

Soon the sterile design of the labs were replaced by the more pleasing residential areas, cold glass and metal structures replaced with green areas and simple paved paths more commonly found in towns and cities all across the Terran Alliance.

Well, kinda.

The ‚ÄúTown‚Äù was a strange amalgamation of different designs and purposes from all over the Alliance, as if sections from various cultures had been transported from all over the galaxy. The aquariums of the Olgro stood next to the tall open-air theatres of the Parket. Restaurants and cafes that wouldn't be out of place on Earth had sand gardens found on every Ritilian planet.

It was everything a person might want or need in order to remain happy and healthy, keeping the academics and the many many members of the support staff at Research Location 9 in top mental shape.

The cafe they were eventually dropped off outside was clearly a Terran inspired creation, one that made Johnathan feel at home, long loved memories of using copious amounts of caffeine to fuel his studying and research over the years. The plants and old styled wooden decor reminded him of his university years.

Considering this entire place had been built less than five years ago, it was impressive how‚Ä¶ *old* and cozy everything here felt, as if it had been built into the rockbed of the town, everything purposefully crafted to recreate the familiar surroundings so many academics have gone through. Neither Dr Fletcher or Lena were thinking about such things as they rapidly approached the table that already housed two individuals.

‚ÄúSorry, sorry sorry sorry. I didn‚Äôt realize the time!‚Äù John apologized as he took his seat opposite the pair, taking a quick moment to type in a quick snack and a black coffee into the replicator, Lena floating as always in the empty seat to his left.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure you had something important you were working on.‚Äù The uplift spoke softly, eyes glued towards the table as always, the simple sandwich and glass of water standing in front of him. The black labrador seemed to always look tired, dressed from head to toe in simple white clothing, absentmindedly scratching an arm along the sleeve as he talked, a tick he seemed to do at all times.

Spencer was never one to speak up, barely raising his voice above a whisper or really talking about himself much during the six months Johnathan had been here. Even now he wasn‚Äôt 100% certain exactly what he did, something about Medigel and biogenetic engineering.

‚ÄúWhat could be more important than the trial run of Project Lazeros?‚Äù The second of the pair exclaimed, the little rodent animated as he spoke, his gigantic plate of Brazil nuts and a cup of hot chocolate loaded with whipped cream almost as large as he was.

Rux was the complete opposite to Spencer, a Quoxxett, a species of 2ft tall brown furred rodents who had joined the Terran Alliance years ago. They were well known for their pups being rambunctious and eventually calming down in their adult years, although nobody seemed to have told Rux this. He was loud, energetic, arrogant and completely full of life, as if God had decided to pack a whole 8ft full of personality into a 2ft tall being.

They both were Johnathan and Lena‚Äôs neighbours, and like all good social creatures, had ended up forming a mild companionship to talk and share stories about their research. That was one of the intended benefits of Research Location 9: Academics from corners of research that would normally never interact were allowed to mingle, meaning that when they weren‚Äôt getting into fist fights over minor differences, allowed for a communication of ideas that would be unlikely otherwise.

**‚ÄúInterested question: What was the result of Lazeros?‚Äù**

‚ÄúSuccess, glorious success! Movement without warp, no need to worry about the stupid issue of warping into stuff. Go as fast as your fuel can take you!‚Äù They shouted out with glee, a few Brazil nuts rolling away as he spoke with enthusiasm. ‚ÄúSure, it was only one particle, moving five inches. And the machine caught on fire due to the power draw. But it WORKED, the rest is just details! It‚Äôs no longer a theory, it works in practicality, I am a GOD, and the laws of physics can suck my-‚Äù

Rux was interrupted by a light cough coming from Spencer, the uplift only briefly looking up for a moment as they cut off the rude statement the Quoxxett was about to say. Lena was legitimately interested in the progress of Project Lazeros, since the device the little Rodent was helping to build was the next stage in FTL travel. Eventually, if they refined it enough after hundreds of years, the engine would be good enough to travel galaxies if needed.

It was strange that a Quoxxett was the one in charge of the project, since the little rodent species weren‚Äôt known for blistering scientific prowess, although the Scythen guessed it was the standard Terran effect: They had a tendency to make all their friends the best versions of themselves.

‚ÄúWhile it is good, Johnathan and Lena have only just arrived, and we‚Äôve not even asked them how they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù The uplift softly spoke in that soft sad tone he always did. ‚ÄúNo need to be rude.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶‚Äù Rux at least had the wherewithal to look suitably shamed. ‚ÄúSorry guys, did you have any news regarding your hunt for a project?‚Äù

**‚ÄúPositive affirmation: Our new possible project has positive outlooks. Thank you for asking.‚Äù**

‚ÄúYeah I think this might be the one.‚Äù Johnathan added, feeling a little better about his latest idea. If the Scythen was helping, and stating it was a ‚Äòpositive outlook‚Äô then that surely meant he was on the right path. ‚ÄúI was just running some final simulations on a new process of blocking XK waves when MATILDA kicked me out.‚Äù

‚ÄúUuuugh, MATILDA suuucks.‚Äù Rux exclaimed again, getting half covered in cream as he took a big drink from his hot chocolate. ‚ÄúI preferred it when all AI were just trying to kill people, not nag you to take proper breaks.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do agree MATILDA can be a little‚Ä¶ strict at times.‚Äù Spencer softly added. ‚ÄúEspecially since the universal Medigel project is nearly completed, and I do wish for this project to end as soon as possible.‚Äù

The four all nodded or changed colour in agreement, the unlikely grouping of academics from different studies all coming together and sharing in their same negative opinions about ‚ÄòNot being allowed to overwork themselves‚Äô. Sitting there in a group, showed how unique Dr Fletcher‚Äôs position of self doubt and dedicate wasn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with not sleeping!‚Äù Rux added with gusto. ‚ÄúIf I want to spend 40 hours in a row working on a project, that‚Äôs why Terrans invented lethal amounts of caffeine and hard drugs!‚Äù

There was a brief pause as the trio just stared at the sugar-fueled rodent, concern with the Quoxxett‚Äôs attitude emanating from all of them as the little mammal took another generous helping of his drink.

**‚ÄúConcerned warning: Rux, you worry me sometimes.‚Äù**

‚úÖ Boring = Building.
‚úÖ Repetitive = Progress.
‚úÖ Slow = Strong.

Why?
Think of a tree:
You plant the seed (exciting!).
You see the first sprout (so cool!).
Then‚Ä¶ it just sits there growing roots underground for months. Boring. Invisible. But without roots, the tree falls over.

Your work is growing roots right now.

Why the ""boring phase"" is actually your superpower:

No Competition: Most people quit here. If you keep going, you automatically rise.

Skills Get Deep: Repeating small tasks turns you into an expert without you noticing.

Trust Builds: Showing up consistently (even quietly) makes people rely on you.

Real Foundations: Slow growth = strong, lasting results. Fast growth often crashes.

How to survive (and thrive) in the boring zone:

Track Tiny Wins: Write down 1 small win daily. (‚ÄúPosted Reel,‚Äù ‚ÄúEmailed 1 client,‚Äù ‚ÄúRead 5 pages‚Äù).

Focus on Habits, Not Hype: Do your 10-20 min daily action ‚úÖ (see my last post!). Forget ‚Äúviral‚Äù or ‚Äúovernight success.‚Äù

Find the Quiet Joy: Notice little improvements. Your writing flows easier. You fix problems faster. That‚Äôs progress!

Connect with Your ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù: Remind yourself why you started. (‚ÄúFreedom?‚Äù ‚ÄúHelping others?‚Äù ‚ÄúBuilding something yours?‚Äù). Write it down. Stick it up.

Celebrate Showing Up: Reward yourself for consistency, not just big results. (Example: ‚Äú7 days in a row? I deserve that fancy coffee!‚Äù).

I‚Äôm a queer Christian woman living near Sacramento, CA, and I‚Äôd really love to connect with others in the LGBTQ+ community who are also navigating faith and identity.

Whether you‚Äôre deconstructing, reconstructing, deeply rooted in your faith, or somewhere in between‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear from you. I‚Äôm open to coffee meetups, nature walks, Bible study, deep talks, or even just a group chat for encouragement and support.

I am in a sticky situation and could use the insight of some experts. I work at a business (not a cafe or anything to do with food), but a very large and strict health-care business. We have offices, naturally, and people want coffee. But, the only machines we can buy MUST have ""C-UL"" rating, which stands for ""commercial"" UL rating, see below

It also needs to have a three-prong (grounded) electrical cord. This is the only way we will be allowed coffee. The way it stands, we have no coffee, and never have. I'd like to see if I can change that. But it's hard to search for this rating, because google suggests commercial machines - as in, commercial for a cafe - which is not what we can do haha.

1m6l4on,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianDevelopers/comments/1m6l4on/the_magic_happens_when_youre_bored_seriously/,The Magic Happens When You‚Äôre Bored (Seriously),"Hey everyone,

Ever start a project, side hustle, or goal super excited‚Ä¶ only to hit a point where it feels slow, repetitive, and honestly‚Ä¶ kinda boring? You‚Äôre not alone. That ""meh"" middle phase is where most people quit.

But here‚Äôs the truth:
‚úÖ Boring = Building.
‚úÖ Repetitive = Progress.
‚úÖ Slow = Strong.

Why?
Think of a tree:
You plant the seed (exciting!).
You see the first sprout (so cool!).
Then‚Ä¶ it just sits there growing roots underground for months. Boring. Invisible. But without roots, the tree falls over.

Your work is growing roots right now.

Why the ""boring phase"" is actually your superpower:

No Competition: Most people quit here. If you keep going, you automatically rise.

Skills Get Deep: Repeating small tasks turns you into an expert without you noticing.

Trust Builds: Showing up consistently (even quietly) makes people rely on you.

Real Foundations: Slow growth = strong, lasting results. Fast growth often crashes.

How to survive (and thrive) in the boring zone:

Track Tiny Wins: Write down 1 small win daily. (‚ÄúPosted Reel,‚Äù ‚ÄúEmailed 1 client,‚Äù ‚ÄúRead 5 pages‚Äù).

Focus on Habits, Not Hype: Do your 10-20 min daily action ‚úÖ (see my last post!). Forget ‚Äúviral‚Äù or ‚Äúovernight success.‚Äù

Find the Quiet Joy: Notice little improvements. Your writing flows easier. You fix problems faster. That‚Äôs progress!

Connect with Your ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù: Remind yourself why you started. (‚ÄúFreedom?‚Äù ‚ÄúHelping others?‚Äù ‚ÄúBuilding something yours?‚Äù). Write it down. Stick it up.

Celebrate Showing Up: Reward yourself for consistency, not just big results. (Example: ‚Äú7 days in a row? I deserve that fancy coffee!‚Äù).

Remember:
üî• Excitement starts things.
üå± Boring builds them.

Don‚Äôt quit when you can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù growth. Your roots are spreading. Your tree is coming.

1m6l36r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m6l36r/dd_the_value_play_cycle_needs_its_third_why_im/,[DD] The Value Play Cycle Needs Its Third: Why I'm Betting on DNUT,"Alright degenerates, we need to talk. OPEN ripped. KSS followed. But these cycles always come in threes, and we're missing the final piece.

**""History doesn't repeat but it does rhyme""** \- so what's the next verse?

I think it's DNUT. But if you've got a better idea, drop it in the comments. Here's my case:

# The Setup: OPEN your ahole and KSS DNUTz

Yeah, I went there. But while everyone's drunk on the first two gains, there's a $560M market cap company trading at bankruptcy multiples despite growing revenue.

**Current Price: $3.58**  
**Market Cap: $560M**  
**My Target: $8-12**

Show me another 2-3x opportunity this obvious.

# The Valuation Gap Is Insane

Look at these multiples and tell me this makes sense:

|Company|EV/EBITDA|EV/Sales|Context|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**DNUT**|**9.2x**|**1.2x**|Priced for bankruptcy despite growth|
|Starbucks|18.9x|3.57x|Premium coffee valuation|
|Restaurant Brands|17.0x|\~5x|Tim Hortons/BK parent|
|Dunkin' (2020 sale)|**23x**|N/A|What buyers actually pay for donuts|

Yet DNUT is:

* Operating **17,982 points of access globally**
* Posted 5% organic growth in FY2024
* Has one of the most recognized brands in food

Find me another company this disconnected from fundamentals.

# The Bear Cases Are All Weak

**""Ozempic will kill fast food""** \- I'm a fatass myself and there's no amount of Ozempic that removes my craving for hot, fresh donuts at 2am. Look at MCD and CMG at ATHs. People on Ozempic eat less, not never. A glazed donut is 190 calories of pure dopamine - that demand isn't disappearing.

**""The McDonald's deal ended!""** \- No, the TEST ended after rolling out to 2,400 stores. You think McDonald's spent millions on infrastructure for a 3-month trial? They're analyzing data. If it worked (spoiler: donuts + coffee = money), this goes nationwide.

**""They suspended the dividend!""** \- Good. They're investing in growth instead of paying boomers. That's exactly what you want in a turnaround.

# Three Ways This Plays Out

**Starting Point:**

* Stock: $3.58
* Market Cap: $560M
* Growing business with fixable issues

**Scenario 1: Modest Re-rate (12x EBITDA)**

Still way below peers:

* **Target: $8-9**
* **Return: 125-150%**

**Scenario 2: Industry Average (15x)**

If operations improve:

* **Target: $11-13**
* **Return: 200-250%**

**Scenario 3: Nothing Changes (10x)**

Status quo maintained:

* **Target: $5-6**
* **Return: 40-70%**

Even the bear case would be a healthy return on your money. Show me better risk/reward.

# Why The Setup Is Perfect

‚úì **Meme-able ticker** (DNUT - come on)  
‚úì **Small cap** ($560M = moves fast)  
‚úì **Value play** (half peer multiples)  
‚úì **Real business** (17,982 locations)  
‚úì **Catalyst rich** (McDonald's decision pending)  
‚úì **Acquisition target** (at these multiples) ‚úì **Options flow confirming** (Huge call buying at $5 strike)

# Recent ""Problems"" Are Actually Bullish

* **Q1 revenue down 1%** ‚Üí They sold Insomnia Cookies (portfolio cleanup)
* **Dividend suspended** ‚Üí More cash for growth/turnaround
* **McDonald's test ""ended""** ‚Üí Infrastructure built, awaiting expansion
* **Debt concerns** ‚Üí Manageable at 5x EBITDA, becomes nothing if margins improve

Every QSR turnaround story looks exactly like this before the re-rate.

# But Here's Where I Need Your Input

I'm convinced DNUT is the third play because:

1. **Valuation** \- It's the most undervalued name I can find
2. **Size** \- Small enough to move like OPEN and KSS did
3. **Catalysts** \- McDonald's decision, margin improvements, M&A potential
4. **Meme factor** \- The ticker alone guarantees viral potential
5. **Options flow** \- Big money is already positioning

But maybe I'm missing something. What else fits the pattern?

* Under $1B market cap?
* Trading at distressed multiples?
* Has clear catalysts ahead?
* Meme-able enough for WSB?
* Seeing unusual options activity?

Drop your picks below. But until someone shows me better risk/reward than 7:1 upside, I'm loading DNUT.

# Someone's Already Loading - Check the Options Flow

Here's what really got my attention: MASSIVE call buying the past few days, absolutely exploding today. The $5 strikes are getting hammered with volume.

Someone with deep pockets is betting big on a move above $5. That's a 40% move from here, and they're paying premium for it. When smart money moves this aggressively on a small cap, you pay attention.

This isn't retail buying weeklies. This is institutional-sized flow betting on a re-rate.

[past week](https://preview.redd.it/xcxfleepngef1.png?width=2142&format=png&auto=webp&s=b69b385edf49636702af95a44e47b6c3d3038751)

[today](https://preview.redd.it/1od3hcy7qgef1.png?width=2150&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af667fdfc86245bc643c1a068a79688b06447dd)

# The Play

The options market is telling you something. When you see this kind of call buying on a beaten-down small cap with clear catalysts, it usually means someone knows something.

Those $5 calls? If DNUT hits just the LOW end of fair value ($8), those are 10-15x. If it hits $12? Those calls print harder than JPow in 2020.

I like the 11/21 $5 call. IV is only at 87% and volume is sufficient at 2k+

https://preview.redd.it/9lghn7dwqgef1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f654e56abef9da84cf86b0b6c83fa3e7757b2

**My Position:**

https://preview.redd.it/s2v1a859sgef1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c006ba69e418e6820ad3344bd8773fd44756bc9

The first two already ran. Don't be late to the third.

Because when McDonald's announces the national rollout, when margins tick up even 100bps, when some PE firm offers 15x EBITDA - this thing gaps to $8+ overnight.

Every distressed QSR (finance bro speak for fast food) that fixed itself got bought:

* Dunkin': 23x EBITDA to Inspire Brands
* Panera: Bought by JAB
* Popeyes: Acquired by RBI
* Buffalo Wild Wings: Taken private by Roark

At current multiples, DNUT is a sitting duck.

The cycle comes in threes:  
OPEN ‚úì  
KSS ‚úì  
???

I‚Äôm a frontend developer and recently I feel more and more that my computer is not enough to handle everything without any stress from my side (0 tolerance for freezes).
If not for that reason, I wouldn‚Äôt even think about changing my computer at all. 
So since I mostly use my computer for work (I use it for personal stuff too, but my current computer is more than enough for that), I just can‚Äôt justify buying a very expensive machine so I can work harder. Don‚Äôt know if that makes sense, but right now I just feel like I‚Äôd prefer spending money that I earn on some non work related things. 
I‚Äôve also invested time and money in building my home office and I enjoy it and don‚Äôt usually go out to work (and drink an overpriced coffee lol) 
So here is the question. 
I‚Äôm thinking about buying a mac mini (a recent one), so it‚Äôs powerful enough, but would allow me to save a lot of money. I also really like the aesthetics of mac mini and monitor on the desk, instead of a macbook. 
Or invest money in Macbook Pro (also recent one, if I spend money, I would def prefer a brand new machine). 

I see it more as a portable/stationary question (maybe I‚Äôm wrong), so I‚Äôm not going to get rid of my current Macbook Pro, so I would still be able to use it when I‚Äôm traveling. Does this sound feasible?

In my early twenties, it was a lot of drugs (except heroin, cocaine, or crack), then from 2010 to 2017, it was Kratom. I managed to quit, and from 2017 to the pandemic I took nootropics like racetams. When the pandemic started, I had a huge crash and quit everything for six months. After recovering, I started using much milder substances like mushroom coffee, and then I discovered this forum and quit coffee‚Ä¶ only to replace it with energy drinks made with Yerba mate, especially Guayaki.

So it seems that, strangely, I need something daily‚Äîfor well-being, for energy, and also for creativity. But now that I‚Äôm approaching 40, I want to regain my old energy and health. Guayaki gives me a boost, a kick, but paradoxically it drains my energy, and in the end, I don‚Äôt do anything. I read a lot on this forum but don‚Äôt write much, and the other messages I‚Äôve posted here all say the same thing because I‚Äôm still in the same place today.

I want to stop all harmful substances, and these drinks are part of that. I want to eventually just drink plain Yerba mate tea or matcha‚Äîmaybe daily, maybe occasionally. This week, I managed to quit for two and a half days. That‚Äôs the longest I‚Äôve gone in two years. And what I felt was wonderful‚Ä¶ I saw the light at the end of the tunnel, I felt that happiness could someday return. Life felt beautiful, even though it was hard.

But I relapsed and fell back into my old habits‚Ä¶ And today, after drinking a Guayaki, I realized that every time I drink one, I feel anxious, frozen, and depressed. So there‚Äôs no point in continuing, even if I crave that kick that I don‚Äôt feel when I‚Äôm completely sober.

I told my therapist that I don‚Äôt feel like a sober person because of these drinks. I told him that the psychedelics I took when I was younger‚Äîwhich I‚Äôll never take again‚Äîcontained a powerful metaphor: you suffer to feel better afterward. He replied that that‚Äôs the foundation of addiction recovery. Fair enough‚Ä¶

I work as a clerk in a pharmacy, and I see the other employees drinking Red Bull or Monster‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never experienced being truly sober from these drinks at work, and that scares me a bit.

Anyway, sorry for using artificial intelligence to translate my message, and sorry for writing such a long post. I find this forum really inspiring and come back every day. But the main goal is to quit these substances and never go back‚Äîto finally live life. Tomorrow I‚Äôll quit again, because I‚Äôm feeling motivated. I‚Äôve read that the energy does come back after a while, and that‚Äôs very motivating to me.

Walkable for us requires a priority of wide and maintained and lit sidewalks that‚Äôs likely somewhat flat for 2 dogs and a stroller. It‚Äôs more about getting the dogs good walks  of 2+ miles and getting outside, then being able to 100% walk to every daily need. NoVa does this extremely well imo.

Green spaces! We are really outsidey and not that outdoorsy. Going back to point of walking, we love having maintained trails for biking, lots of parks with walking trails, AllTrails intermediate hiking within 2 hours, and water (lake, then creek, then ocean, then river in preference) within an hour drive. Besides going on meandering neighborhood walks with coffee, walking to overlooks and biking under trees is our favorite joint hobby. Not a winter lover but would prefer lake effect over like Texas heat.

Friendly people - probably the most like the Midwest - my favorite people have been in Pittsburgh and Denver . We live in a Mayberry kinda neighborhood where people sit on porches and pick up mail and plan block retirement parties and kids are outside all the time and definitely don‚Äôt want to change that. Ideally we‚Äôd like some Denver vibes - a  bit younger/more families, much more extroverted, like to do things that aren‚Äôt just bars (sober) or TV, work hard to play harder. Absolutely hated DC as someone whose not career motivated/smart as an identity and Harrisburg as someone whose not religious  - so definitely no culture like those.

Affordability - people can make it work on one corporate income for a family of 4 to save 30% and still vacation 1-2x a year. Ideally would love to keep a mortgage under 2.5k (20% down) but doesn‚Äôt matter how the makeup is. Could be cheap house but high property tax, expensive house low property tax. Not interested in natural disasters so probably not high home owners insurance.

Kid friendly - good schools esp ones that have lots of access to extra curricular, kids spend most of their time outside and with friends, great playgrounds, safe for them to walk around by themselves in middle school, decent healthcare system.

Would be nice but certainly not a deal breaker - rock climbing gym, weather that allows you/dogs/infants to be outside safely for a few hours 70%+ of the year, minimal natural disasters, good air quality, a clean and growing downtown area with lots of local businesses, stitch and birch and book meet ups, easy access to a major highway, airport under an hour, purpley blue politics (I liked Va and Denver), a decent grocer that has access to a wide variety veggies that aren‚Äôt poor condition

The absolute eliminating factor - no more than 6 hours from at least one of the following: Buffalo, Frederick Md, Lancaster Pa, Richmond Va, Lebanon tn, Neptune city nj, Chicago, or Charlotte.

We are leaning towards Charlotte metro (worried about the culture of a more religious/traditional south) or Buffalo NY metro (worried about the economy). Anywhere else to consider?

My landlord now wants me out due to a ‚Äúlease violation,‚Äù and I want to make sure the proper process is being followed and my rights are protected.

I moved in mid last year. My elderly terminally ill mother lived in the state I was originally from. She suffered a soft tissue injury in mid-March 2025, and I brought her to stay with me while she recovered. She has a small dog. When I moved in, the landlord had said I could have visitors and pets were allowed with a deposit, so I emailed about the visit and paying a pet deposit for her stay. I never got a response. 

Soon after arriving, my mother‚Äôs condition worsened and she needed hospitalization and physical therapy. She still isn‚Äôt independent enough to return home, so she has to stay here for now. Throughout these months, my landlords casually asked how she was doing and even petted the dog, never raising concerns.

Then, a few days ago, during a coffee meeting, my landlord suddenly told me he wanted to evict me over my mother and the dog, saying they‚Äôd been ‚Äúpissed off‚Äù but hadn‚Äôt told me. I offered solutions‚Äîpet deposit, rent increase, utilities‚Äîbut he dismissed this and gave me 30 days‚Äô notice by text on July 21, later saying the tenancy would end in September and the notice couldn‚Äôt be rescinded.

I thought landlords in D.C. had to issue a written notice to cure with specific steps and 30 days to comply before termination‚Äîam I correct? Also, any advice on this situation or finding a place in D.C. with an older parent (I worry about age discrimination)?

1m6kvj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1m6kvj5/stablecoin_fascination_is_creating_mispricings_in/,Stablecoin Fascination is Creating Mispricings in Quality Payments Companies,"Don't get me wrong, the concept of stablecoins is intriguing. A ""zero-fee"" transfer of value from wallet to wallet. It'd be nice, right? 

Well yes, but at the moment, you need on-ramps and off-ramps. In other words, you could put dollars into a digital wallet to buy USDC then send that USDC to another wallet. But if that recipient wants to do anything with it (like buy a coffee, pay their rent, get some groceries) they need to convert it back to their local sovereign currency, because that's what people accept. And when you convert, there are costs. So, no, stablecoins aren't really zero cost. 

I can hear some of you already ""well what if merchants accept stablecoins??"" It makes sense that they'd want to. After all, I'm sure they don't love paying 2%-3% to payments processors for every transaction. But who will build the digital infrastructure for Stablecoin-accepting point of sales systems if it's zero cost? There would be no economic incentive to do so. 

Maybe these things get solved in time and some company comes along and eliminates this friction and thinks up some newfound monetization strategy, but right now everyone thinks stablecoins create this utopian payments world, when in reality, it doesn't reduce friction or costs at the moment. 

That brings me to mispricings. 

**Remitly and Wise:**

The one area I see the most obvious mispricing is in the digital remittance space. Wise and Remitly are two of the best positioned companies in this industry, as they both help people easily move money across borders at a lower cost than incumbents. 

Wall Street however is paranoid about the idea of stablecoins stealing volume from these digital remittance providers. But while wall st is paranoid, Wise and Remitly both keep moving more and more volume through their system. 

Today, Wise processes **$210B in volume (up 5x since 2019)** annually from both businesses and consumers. They generate about **$2B in revenue** and **earn about $750M in EBT**. Meanwhile they've got an EV of \~$12.5B. I think the path to $1.5B in EBT is pretty clear-cut within a few years. So call it 8x a few years out earnings. 

Remitly on the other hand processes **$59B in volume (up 8x since 2019)** annually, generates **$1.4B in revenue**, and is just now turning the corner to profitability. They have an enterprise value of $3B. I think Remitly could easily be generating 20% operating margins which would yield $400-$500M in annual operating income in 5 years on my rev growth estimates. That means they're trading **at \~6x to 8x my estimate of 2030 OI.**  

Both of these business are high-quality, fast growing, and have clear operating leverage. I think they deserve a more premium multiple.",1,1753206455.0,ValueInvesting,2,1.0,False

I had family from Brazil visit in the US, and they really struggled with the concept of cream for coffee. Does Brazil use cream in coffee? Are all the milks with various fat contents common in grocery stores (ie - fat-free, skim, 1%, 2%, vitamin D, coffee creamer, cream, half-and-half, whipping cream, heavy whipping cream, whipped cream (sweet dessert), etc)?

1m6kukt,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1m6kukt/trip_report/,Trip Report,"Me and my partner spent 13 days exploring Iceland‚Äôs Ring Road with a 4x4, staying in a mix of hotels and Airbnbs.

Flight: We took a red-eye, assuming we‚Äôd sleep, but ended up not sleeping and exhausted on our first day. In hindsight, I‚Äôd avoid this in the future.

Car Rental: Northern Lights Car Rental offered the cheapest 4x4. We were a bit nervous due to mixed reviews, but it turned out fine. Thought we‚Äôd get a Vitara but they gave us an S-Cross. The Suzuki S-Cross had 330,000 km which worried us but ended up reliable enough.

Food: We mostly cooked with groceries but also tried several restaurants and food trucks. Next time I‚Äôd skip Costco because B√≥nus and Kr√≥nan were all we really needed for 13 days. Great sandwiches.

Day 1: Went straight from the airport to the Blue Lagoon. After seeing other lagoons, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not essential at all, though their large sauna overlooking the water was pretty great and unmatched at the other lagoons we tried. We wandered Reykjav√≠k and, of course, tried the famous hot dog.

Day 2: An early start at √ûingvellir. Bruarfoss quickly became one of our top three waterfalls. Lunch at Fri√∞heimar was interesting but a bit overpriced-not quite the ‚Äúmust-do‚Äù people rave about. Hrunalaug hot spring was peaceful and quiet when we went. 

Day 3: Drove to Landmannalaugar, stopping at Haifoss, Gj√°in, and Sig√∂lduglj√∫fur-each one breathtaking and all highlights of the trip. The F208 and F225 roads were rougher than expected; next time we‚Äôd choose a car with better clearance for the peace of mind. The weather at Landmannalauger wasn‚Äôt the best for the hike we planned so we skipped it, but the drive alone was stunning. The Landmannalaugar hot springs were our favourite- free, quiet, and perfectly hot.

Day 4: Headed to the south coast, stopping at the American School Bus Caf√© for dessert and coffee-quirky and fun. Seljalandsfoss and Sk√≥gafoss were beautiful, though busy. The hike above Sk√≥gafoss revealed more waterfalls and felt less crowded. We stayed at a dairy farm nearby, which was a nice change of pace.

Day 5: Dyrh√≥laey was windy but peaceful, with puffins everywhere and the sound of the ocean in the background. Reynisfjara beach was impressive but packed with people. We loved The Soup Company in V√≠k-great value with free refills. The mossy lava fields felt like walking on another planet. Stj√≥rnarfoss was a lovely surprise, perfect for swimming if you bring gear. We also hiked Svartifoss, a short but rewarding 2-hour round trip.

Day 6: A Zodiac boat tour at J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n was unforgettable - we got close to freshly calved icebergs with only 8-10 people on board the boat. Diamond Beach was striking, with massive chunks of ice scattered across the sand. Vestrahorn and Stokksnes were serene and unexpectedly empty, offering perfect reflection photos, definitely will return here. In H√∂fn, we tried reindeer burgers, lobster bisque, and lobster pizza - all excellent.

Day 7: Sk√∫tafoss was quiet and felt like more of a quiet spot. Hengifoss was my favourite hike - steep but shorter, with dramatic red rock layers behind the falls. You can see the destination the whole hike which I liked. V√∂k Baths were incredible (floating between the cold lake and hot pools was the best), though we wished they had a dry sauna. Vok baths was way better than Blue Lagoon. Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur, tucked between mountains, was probably my favourite town. Gufufoss nearby the town was worth a quick stop.

Day 8: Studlagil canyon was stunning, though the parking chaos made it tricky (we went at peak time). Dettifoss was impressive but I might skip it next time. Hverir geothermal area was fascinating if you can handle the sulfur smell. Go√∞afoss was quick and worth the stop. We didn‚Äôt spend long in the M√Ωvatn area but the drive itself was beautiful.

Day 9: Whale watching in H√∫sav√≠k with Gentle Giants was a highlight-we saw several whales up close on the RIB boat, one gave us a show with pectoral slapping. A more relaxed day with ice cream at Brynja in Akureyri (some of the best we‚Äôve had) and sampling Icelandic snacks later-surprisingly, dried fish with butter and rye bread was pretty good. Trying a bunch of Skyr flavours was also fun.

Day 10: Long drive to Sn√¶fellsnes Peninsula, stopping at KIDKA Wool Factory and Erpssta√∞ir Creamery. The cheeses and butter were great, especially the cayenne cream cheese. Ice cream was just ok for us.

Day 11: Despite the volcanic haze and fog in Snaefellsness, this day turned out to be a favourite. Maestro‚Äôs hot dogs in Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur were so good we went back for seconds. We explored a lava cave with a tour company, had the best meal of our trip at FRISKA (fish and chips), visited the black church, and saw seals for the first time at Ytri Tunga. Rau√∞feldsgj√° Gorge looked super cinematic at the entrance with the clouds and birds circling above, we did skip going through the entire gorge due to the amount of people in there.

Day 12: Stopped at our last waterfalls , Hraunfossar and Barnafoss‚Äîboth beautiful and worth it. In Reykjav√≠k, we ate cinnamon rolls at Brau√∞ & Co, rye bread ice cream at Caf√© Loki, and fish skewers at Sea Baron. Went to a bunch of thrift stores and bought a handmade wool sweater for a great price. Our final night ended at H√∫s m√°ls og menningar (bookstore-turned-bar), where the live music was so good we stayed until closing.

This subreddit was a huge help while planning- Iceland truly did feel like another planet, there‚Äôs no where in the world like it. hope this report gives someone else some ideas!

Next time, I‚Äôd commit to longer hikes, explore lesser known areas as well as the West Fjords, overall take it slower and also get a bigger more capable 4x4 car for F-Roads.",9,1753206394.0,VisitingIceland,0,1.0,False

1. my experience - 2 years of brewing in french press and moka pot, 3-4 types of beans only (pre-ground) yet. 
2. situation - basically, this grinder goes to 0 on the grind size (this is when the lever stops rotating normally by itself). but, after the zero point, I can still go about 4 lower grind sizes. 
3. grinder used for - I did grind about 750 gms of coffee (Nandan Coffee light roast, Aranya Gold) through the grinder. It has general ranges for the french press, so tried and tested (tasted!) few grind sizes between 145 and 165 clicks.
4. my query - I did not go lower than absolute 0 clicks (while checking the grind clicks for normal workflow), but is my grinder faulty for going below the point where its lever stops rotation? I ignored this until day before yesterday, but I read a post somewhere that the guy got his hand grinder replaced under warranty for the same situation as me, previously I ignored this because I did not think anything wrong with it.

Please reply, and suggest some cheap coffees to go along with this. I recently purchased Bialetti Moka Pot (dispatched today from Latteholic, 3 cup) and would love to taste some good coffee.

He asks me to lift my arms to examine my breasts. Right looks good. Gets to my left, on the side (kinda by my armpit). Kinda makes a face and says, ‚ÄúYou have to be checking yourself.‚Äù My heart sunk. I was like, ‚ÄúWhat? I do!‚Äù He grabbed my right hand and pressed into a golf ball sized lump. 

I was in shock a little. He continued, getting to the pelvic exam and saying it all looked good in there. Then he casually tells me I‚Äôm going to have to go get an ultrasound. That it‚Äôs most likely just benign and just fibrous tissue. I tried to shrug it off, but I was panicking. 

I went through the next steps of getting a doctor‚Äôs note for a breast ultrasound. I called their office and got an appt scheduled for next Wednesday. 

I called my boyfriend as soon as got to my car. Started driving to get coffee, and broke down on the phone with him in the drive thru line. I told him what my gyno said and about the appt next week. He sounded sad but tried to be brave. I love him. 

Then I called my mom. Unfortunately my dad actually has cancer. He‚Äôs had it since last November. He‚Äôs been through the motions of chemo and radiation. I told her. Explained it all. And she started sobbing, which made me start sobbing. We cried together and she said she‚Äôd tell my dad. 

I came home in a stupor and cried my eyes out with my love holding me. He tried to reassure me, and logically I know it‚Äôs probably benign with my age (26), but I also know my grandmother had lymphoma of some sort. That worries me. 

Here I am just trying to keep my mind busy. It comes and goes though. I just don‚Äôt really know what to do for the next week. I never expected to be here. I‚Äôm so afraid and upset that I‚Äôve made everyone so worried. ",2,1753206209.0,doihavebreastcancer,1,1.0,False

1m6km70,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m6km70/they_came_from_under_the_sea/,They Came From Under The Sea,"The water burbled and churned in the wake of the *Cannon*\-class destroyer escort USS Hansen as it trailed past the darkened shoreline of New England in the late evening of one October day in 1942. From the point of view of its 200-man crew, the sea below them almost didn‚Äôt seem liquid, completely pitch black, and suspiciously calm, so much so that it was hard to fathom the sheer depth of the yawning chasm above which they were suspended as if by magic. The men tried not to think about lost underground caverns that had never seen the light of day, so deep that the nameless creatures who lived there stared out into the abyss with engorged white, blind eyes, trying to reach out and grasp even the slightest hint of light, their mouths hanging open and always hungry. Those things in their holes, cracks, and caverns couldn‚Äôt possibly see or comprehend the massive, thousand-ton steel craft which now glided over their heads or the conflict in which its crew, along with hundreds of millions of men worldwide, were engaged.

On the surface, the dark sea, stretching out to the horizon, merely placidly splashed against the metal hull, almost as if giving the ship a friendly greeting. The sky above was orange with the light of the setting sun, reflecting above the black mirror of the sea. Behind the destroyer glowed the few small lights of the Liberty ships it was escorting as the convoy peeled away from the comforting grey line of the shore and began to venture out into open water, as the sun set completely and the ships were engulfed in complete darkness, as above as below.

The captain of the USS Hansen, a relatively young commander, peered out from behind the windows of the bridge to his left. The convoy was set to take a northerly route towards Greenland as it made its way across the Atlantic in a desperate effort to hide from the roving German wolfpacks, but in order to do so, an exact course was charted through the Vineyard Sound. He peered out into the darkness again, much like the blind creatures who dwell below, scouring the night for the beacon of the Tarpaulin Cove Lighthouse, which would assure safe passage through the narrow and rocky strait. But no light was to be found.

Suddenly, the destroyer was rocked from below, and a jet of water reared up over the starboard side. The electric lights aboard the bridge and elsewhere flickered and went out, as men were thrown from their stations by the sheer power of the crash. There was no time to debate whether they had blindly struck an underwater reef or if the blow was delivered by a torpedo of a roving U-boat, no time at all.¬†

Pandemonium took hold of the crew as the captain wrestled with the steering wheel, trying to steady the ship to no avail. The ship was taking on water fast, and listing heavily to starboard as sailors scrambled for the lifeboats and rafts, but the portside boat was useless, and the cords holding the starboard lifeboat had snapped just as it was full, plunging both it and the sailors inside into the ice-cold water.¬†

Out of desperation, men leaped into the water, holding onto whatever they could find that was buoyant, but the freezing water clung to their clothes and penetrated their flesh right down to their bones, leaving them to helplessly die in the darkness. Within fifteen minutes of impact, the USS Hansen rolled over and vanished beneath the waves with one final crescendo of screams, before the horror of absolute silence drowned them all out.

By the time the Liberty ships trailing the destroyer had arrived at the place of sinking, there was nobody left to save. The USS Hansen had gone down with all hands on deck.¬†

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Bill Kirtland was violently shaken in his seat as his Ford struggled to traverse the pothole-ridden Massachusetts roads, the frame of the car creaking and the engine roaring in the chilly March air. He felt the front wheels of the car fall into another pothole, causing the rainwater that had pooled there from the night before to splash all across the windshield just as he passed a dirty road sign welcoming him to the town of Wood‚Äôs Hole.

Pulling into town, he parked the car, its polished black paint now splattered with muck, by the curb, and got out, straightening his overcoat. The brick buildings all around him somehow seemed both secure and unshakably stable, but also old and decrepit, slowly crumbling away with each salty gust of wind. This was an old, small community perched on the rocky edge of the incomprehensibly Atlantic Ocean, yet sheltered by the outcroppings of islands in the distance, which formed the corridors of both Vineyard Sound and Buzzard‚Äôs Bay.

Bill huddled into his stocky overcoat as another strong gust of wind blew into his face, carrying with it the faint cries of seagulls, forcing him to desperately hold onto the fedora on his head. He made his way to the town‚Äôs municipal building and pushed open the heavy, old wooden door, which had been repainted far too many times. He was greeted by the secretary, sitting behind her desk, vigorously scribbling something illegible on some useless paperwork. Reaching into the right-hand coat pocket, Bill produced his badge and showed it to the secretary, whose eyes, shielded by the thick yet crooked frames of her glasses, stared at it intently, squinting as if deciphering a secret code. This wasn‚Äôt surprising of course; he didn‚Äôt expect immediate recognition, who would, not after the constant restructuring, reorganization, and renaming.

‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm Agent Kirtland, Federal Bureau of Investigation. May I speak to Mayor Smith, please?‚Äù Bill asked in a serious yet monotone and relaxed voice.

‚ÄúSurely, of course, of course‚Ä¶‚Äù hurried the secretary who got up from her chair and hurried through an open doorway behind her, disappearing behind a corner. Bill heard a knock on the door and some indistinct hushed conversation, before a few moments later, a short and slightly pudgy, mustached middle-aged man with a cap on his head, evidently trying to hide his bald spot, appeared before him.

‚ÄúMayor Smith, I presume?‚Äù Bill asked, cordially holding out his hand to greet the mayor, who grasped it and firmly shook it, a jolly if obviously forced smile playing across his face.

‚ÄúYes, and you are?‚Äù politely responded the mayor.

‚ÄúAgent Kirtland, F.B.I.,‚Äù Bill replied, restating his name and title with a forced smile of his own. He wasn‚Äôt here for pleasantries, and indeed, he had no time for them.

‚ÄúAh, yes, of course. We were expecting you. I received a phone call the other day about an open investigation here. I assume you‚Äôre here about the shipwreck?‚Äù The mayor confirmed, closing up with a question in a more serious tone, with hints of deep nervousness being evident from behind his polite manner.

‚ÄúNot specifically about the shipwreck itself, but rather the circumstances of its sinking. Eyewitness reports from the other ships confirm that the Tarpaulin Cove Lighthouse was dark; there's a suspicion that this may be a case of sabotage. What do you know of the lighthouse keeper there?‚Äù Bill asked, completely dropping all pretense of faux joviality.

‚ÄúSabotage? Surely not, this is a very tight-knit community sir, and I can assure you sir, all of us here are patriots to this great nation, especially in times like these‚Ä¶‚Äù the mayor began stumbling, clearly slightly offended, taking the suspicion of sabotage as an accusation of him being a faulty leader. ‚ÄúBut for the lighthouse keeper who‚Äôs stationed there now, he‚Äôs an older gentleman named George Ganh, he rotates off post every three months and spends his off time here in town drinking and such, hangs out with fishermen and sailors of all types, they seem to take to him. But I can‚Äôt say he‚Äôs ever been a bother,‚Äù he concluded.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Bill softened, not meaning to completely scare the timid mayor, ‚ÄúAnd can you tell me where I can find these friends of his?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre down in the old inn, I‚Äôm sure, it's just off School Street by the shore,‚Äù the mayor confirmed, pointing out the window towards the deep blue band of the sea.

‚ÄúThank you once again.‚Äù Bill thanked the mayor and the secretary, ‚ÄúAnd if you come across anything, don‚Äôt hesitate to let me know‚Ä¶‚Äù he finished, handing the mayor his business card, with his name and the Bureau‚Äôs phone number clearly printed on the white cardstock. He tipped his hat and wedged it right back on his head in defiance of the wind and headed back out the door. His next destination was the inn.

The inn was crowded, its old lacquered wooden walls marinated in the smoke from an untold number of cigarettes. A few tables were occupied by some clearly well-to-do couples, likely staying nearby for golf, but in the back, illuminated by an ancient-looking lamp, sat a group of weathered men, all in their mid-fifties. Their clothing was earth-toned, harsh, and purely practical; they sported disheveled hair and beards, and their skin was tanned and leathery. They whispered among themselves, every now and again erupting into a bout of laughter at some joke or another, followed by a good, hearty sip of their beer. These were clearly the right sort of people who might know Ganh.

He approached the group, who turned to face him. Showing them his badge, he gave them the usual introductory spiel.

‚ÄúI was told that some of you may know a man by the name of George Ganh, the keeper of the Tarpaulin Cove Lighthouse,‚Äù he stated, waiting for some sort of confirmation from the group of old salts.

‚ÄúAye, I know him,‚Äù said one of the group, a man wearing a lopsided and beaten-up leather cap, ‚ÄúHe owes us $15 dollars even from the last time he played cards with us, you should arrest him just for that!‚Äù At this, the whole group erupted in laughter once more, at the dismay of Bill, who saw clearly that they didn‚Äôt take this seriously.

‚ÄúFor your information, he is under suspicion of treason. This is a matter of national security.‚Äù Bill said, quietly but with a steel edge to his voice. He appreciated the banter between the men, but had no time to enjoy it, otherwise, he would have gladly joined them just to listen to their obviously cheerful stories and conversation. But he was tasked with the grave responsibility of finding the murderer of 200 men and ensuring that no more would have to die.

‚ÄúWell, I do know him, what else can I say?‚Äù the same man in the leather hat confirmed, now also gaining a tone of seriousness in his voice which sounded not too dissimilar from gravel. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a cooky fellow, that he is. He tells us stories about his old seafaring days before his leg had to be cut off. Stories that are full of ghosts and sea serpents, some the products of his drunken delirium, but others, well, I can‚Äôt say for certain sir-‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he have any contact with people or groups that you might find strange? Have there been any strange men visiting the lighthouse lately, somebody who isn‚Äôt a local?‚Äù Bill asked, nodding his head along to the answers of the old salt.

‚ÄúThere was one friend of his, his old captain, I presume. He wrote to him in Kingsport‚Ä¶‚Äù one of the other sailors piped up and quickly trailed off, gathering his thoughts. ‚ÄúHe had asked me to deliver a package to him once while I was off fishing not far from there. I had the foul curiosity in me to look at what was in that package of his, a letter all filled with some gibberish about magic bottles. The two of them sailed together in the East Indies, and I dare say nothing good ever came of it for both of them!‚Äù

Bill was quickly losing his patience; this was clearly going nowhere productive.

‚ÄúWell, I presume you gentlemen have been out at sea recently. Have you seen anything unusual, possibly resembling a submarine close to Vineyard Sound?‚Äù he asked, trying to gather whatever clues or leads that he could from them. At this question, the group grew quiet and more serious than before. Finally, a man in a smelly wool sweater with a scar across his cheek replied;

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been out there two days before in my sloop, it had only been another two days since the wreck then, and, well, I saw something. There were lights in the water, beneath the waves, I thought I must be hallucinating, but they moved and went directly below my little boat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, I‚Äôll keep that in mind.‚Äù Bill nodded in appreciation and exited out of he crowded inn.¬†

The sea air outside was chill, but relaxing, and he felt the little droplets of the ocean breeze collect on his brows. Seagulls circled over a few jagged rocks that rose out of the sea foam, withstanding wave after wave. The sun was beginning to set, rolling down across the sky. Bill looked out across the gently rolling waves, towards the Vineyard Sound, straining his eyes to see any hints of the strange underwater lights that the old sailors mentioned, or trying to envision the USS Hansen foundering in the waves, but the evening was calm, and nothing could be seen.

He thought of the reports of German saboteurs coming into the country, aiming to wreak havoc. Special cadres of English-speaking Germans were selected to take part in infiltration tactics, where they would be taken to the U.S. by U-boats that bypass all naval defenses and deposit the spies by the shore, giving them free access to run amok. Several instances of these activities have already occurred, such as the George Dasch case, but luckily, all of the spies involved were captured by the Bureau. He theorized that a similar scenario was occurring now, in this quaint coastal town, and that George Ganh was likely either dead or compromised, potentially even working with the Germans. In the morning, he resolved to hire a boat to take him out to the lighthouse and speak with George Ganh himself.

The morning was foggy and damp. Clasping his hands around the warmth radiating from his fresh cup of coffee, Bill looked out over the sea as the little ferry that carried him over to the Tarpaulin Cove Lighthouse bobbed up and down in the waves but continued to barrel through them. He had to quickly shift his grip several times in order to avoid having his hot coffee spill out of the mug and onto his hands, but soon, the cup grew empty, and a long yet thin island drew into view out of the mist. Jagged stones ringed this outcropping of solid land like walls around a fortress, but a break between them soon came into view with a small wooden pier to which the ferry docked, and Bill came ashore.¬†

He packed his empty mug into his briefcase and gently tapped his hand on his holstered handgun, hidden under his sturdy overcoat. The reassuring and calming feeling of its cold steel helped him recover some of his confidence, being forced into a world that was not quite his own. He stepped off the slightly rocking deck of the ferry, onto the creaky, soaked, wooden pier, and made his way down the trail of soggy sand through the tangle of various beach plants towards the lighthouse, silhouetting itself against the fog like a ghost.

He knocked on the battered, heavy wooden door of the lighthouse quarters. A moment of silence followed as he awaited a response, then he knocked again, harder and faster this time.

‚ÄúThis is Agent Kirtland, Federal Bureau of Investigation! Open in the name of the law!‚Äù Bill yelled, trying to make his voice heard through the thick old door and sturdy stone walls of the lighthouse itself. Then, after another moment of silence, broken only by the whispering wind, the lighthouse door creaked open, and in the doorway stood a short, skinny old man with a wooden prosthetic leg. He was completely bald on the top of his head, but the remainder of his hair was long, grey, and wispy. He sported a beard also, even longer and more disheveled than those which Bill had seen on the faces of the other sailors at the inn the day before, although this man‚Äôs face was equally tan, crisscrossed by wrinkles like lines of longitude and latitude on an ancient map. His mouth hung slightly ajar, revealing yellowed teeth, and by the expression of the man‚Äôs eyes, as well as the clear smell emanating on his breath, Bill could tell that he was very, very drunk.

‚ÄúAre you George Ganh?‚Äù Bill asked, squinting, examining the strange man from head to foot.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù the man asked, startled at the question as if he just realized Bill‚Äôs presence, ‚ÄúThat I am, and what is that to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well, I‚Äôd like to ask you a few questions about what you were doing five days ago and about the wreck of the USS Hansen.‚Äù Bill hurriedly replied, showing him his badge and gently pushing the door open with his other hand. Upon hearing Bill mention the name USS Hansen, George suddenly grew deathly pale and eagerly tried to close the door, but Bill stood fast, stopping him.

‚ÄúNo, no, no, I ain‚Äôt answering any of your silly questions, young man, now off with you and whatever office you came from, be off and leave an old man with his peace!‚Äù George loudly protested, attempting to shoo off the FBI agent at his door as if he were nothing but an annoying seagull, but Bill could hear the notes of real, deep fear in the old man‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúSir, you are not under arrest now, but you are the primary suspect in a potential case of criminal negligence at best and treason at worst. Either you will let me in now, or I‚Äôll return with a warrant and put you behind bars!‚Äù Bill said, letting his bare threat ring out, echoing in the chill morning air. George stopped trying to close the door, and both men once again stood in silence, with the only sounds being the distant breaking waves and the squawking birds.¬†

‚ÄúA‚Äôight, so be it, have it your way.‚Äù George finally said and opened the door, allowing Bill to walk inside. The look on the lighthouse keeper‚Äôs face was of barely restrained fear, but of whom or what Bill was unsure. What he was sure of, however, was that such a reaction almost guaranteed that this man had something to do with the sinking of that destroyer.

The inside of the lighthouse was damp, with its old stone walls doing a horrible job of keeping the moisture out and the warmth in, as condensation dripped down from the small, narrow windows. Nevertheless, a fire nicely crackled in a compact stove, casting a warm orange glow around the little room, which was filled with worn-out furniture, with a cracked table at its very center, which was utterly covered with papers of some sort strewn all over the place, unwashed dishes and quite a few empty bottles of whiskey and beer. A door, leading presumably to the equally cramped bedroom of the lighthouse quarters, stood slightly ajar at the opposite end of the room.

‚ÄúWell, waddya want to know?‚Äù said George, looking utterly defeated, crashing down on the tattered couch, looking equally as small and worn out as everything else around him.

‚ÄúWere you on station five days ago?‚Äù asked Bill, laying the foundation.

‚ÄúYes, I was‚Ä¶‚Äù George began, but his gaze suddenly turned away from Bill, to just over Bill‚Äôs shoulder, out the window. There, just outside in the thick fog, sat a proud, large albatross, calmly stretching its wings. George‚Äôs expression turned deathly pale. ‚ÄúYes! I was manning the light!‚Äù he said again, louder, now sounding almost desperate. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to frame me, they want to get rid of me!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho!? Who is trying to do this?‚Äù Bill responded in kind, his voice and demeanor growing more and more agitated.

‚ÄúThe Jerries!‚Äù George croaked out, as if the words were a rock lodged in his throat that he had to forcefully cough out. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here, and they‚Äôre watching me! Three men, wearing black coats, they‚Äôre staying on a yacht in the harbor!‚Äù

Despite any further questioning, Bill was unable to get any more information out of the drunk lighthouse keeper; any question he asked, the old man would just seize up and only shake his head, but he did receive vital confirmation that enemy spies were indeed here. Still, he couldn‚Äôt outright arrest him, not yet. He boarded the ferry going back to Wood‚Äôs Hole and once there, passed the information along to the mayor and the local police department. Tomorrow, they would close down the harbor and the police would close down the harbor and the police would board and search every yacht there, now armed with a warrant and an order for the arrest of George Ganh. In addition, three more agents were already on their way here. Bill felt confident that the case would be solved in no time at all, and the route would be reopened for the Navy.

And so the night passed, and the harbor was closed with the first rays of the sun. The police boarded and searched every yacht, sloop, or barge docked in the harbor, but nothing was found with the exception of disturbed couples and startled sailors. Evidently, George Ganh had lied and was now alerted to the investigation. Bill kicked himself for being so stupid and gullible, but what gave him hope was the belief that the old bastard had no way off of that island, and that he simply couldn‚Äôt run.

As Bill stood at the edge of the harbor, watching the police wrap up their operations, when he heard a rumbling voice from behind.

‚ÄúI see you‚Äôre looking for something‚Ä¶‚Äù

Bill spun around to see one of the fishermen he spoke with yesterday standing not far away, with a scar across his face and the same worn-out sweater that reeked of fish innards. He tufted some tobacco into a charred, curved pipe and lit it with a match, partly looking out over the harbor but then turning to Bill.

‚ÄúThere was a trawler which left harbor yesterday just before midnight, with canvas covering her stern so that her name couldn‚Äôt be seen. She went off southwest along the coast. Most likely she‚Äôs still close by, hiding in some cove or gully,‚Äù the seasoned fisherman continued, ‚ÄúHope that may be of use to you, sir.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù replied Bill, genuinely surprised and thankful at the information. ‚ÄúBut why tell me about this privately? Why not tell them?‚Äù he asked the man, gesturing towards the police officers, partly suspicious, partly curious. Anyone could be working with the enemy; he could not be sure how deep the infiltration went.

The old fisherman looked over at the police officers returning to their station on the far side of the harbor. He drew in a deep breath and let out a smoke ring that drifted on the gentle breeze.

‚ÄúThey, nor the mayor, are much too fond of men like me. They live in their own world, the world of solid soil, plants, and trees,‚Äù he stated, and chuckled a bit, muttering ‚ÄúLandlubbers‚Äù under his breath with a grin, but soon grew deadly serious. ‚ÄúBut I know there are things out there in the sea, things that they don‚Äôt want to admit because it challenges their view of the world, makes them scared.‚Äù He said and paused again, and drew on the pipe, releasing a small puff of smoke. ‚ÄúEven you are not so different from them in that regard; at least you did not laugh off when we spoke of the lights yesterday. I saw them again in the night, and they ain‚Äôt Jerries, that I can say for sure. There's no use in going after Ganh, he's a dead man and he knows it.‚Äù

Bill stood beside the man in silence, thinking over the fisherman‚Äôs words for a few moments. Suspicion welled up inside of him; perhaps this man was indeed working with the enemy, attempting to cover up their activities, leading him down the wrong trail. And yet, a deep respect for the old salt was there in his soul, too. Bill looked at the fisherman, and without asking for clarification or explanation, made only one simple request: ‚ÄúCan you take me to the lighthouse regardless?‚Äù

‚ÄúAye, that I can, I suppose that‚Äôs the least I can do.‚Äù The fisherman shrugged his shoulders and nodded. After Bill had alerted the mayor and the police about the trawler, who then passed his reports down to the Coast Guard, Bill prepared to take Ganh in. He loaded his handgun and neatly folded the warrant, placing it in the inside pocket of his coat, right beside his badge.

He boarded the fisherman‚Äôs sloop, an ancient-looking two-masted sailing yacht with fixtures for attaching nets and multiple fishing poles along her beaten-up and creaking, yet lacquered and lovingly maintained hull, quiet befitting its captain. Soon, the sloop slipped off its moorings and began making its way towards the Tarpaulin Cove Lighthouse, just as the sun crested its zenith at late noon.

By the time Bill and the fisherman drew up to the long, lonely, rocky island upon which the lighthouse stood, the evening was already in full swing. Tying the boat up against the same pier used by the ferry, the fisherman allowed Bill to disembark, but yelled at him from behind.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm warning you one last time, it's too dangerous out there, Ganh is a dead man regardless!‚Äù

Bill shrugged off the fisherman‚Äôs cries. After all, what's one more crazy seafaring old man? Whether or not he was in cahoots with the Germans was irrelevant now; Ganh was right there, and the trawler was the Coast Guard‚Äôs responsibility. Whatever happens to him now, the German spies were cornered regardless. He turned around one last time, glancing over his shoulder, only to see the fisherman‚Äôs craft pull away from the pier and fade into the seemingly permanent mist surrounding the island.

He clambered up to the lighthouse door and pounded on it with his fist.¬†

‚ÄúFederal Bureau of Investigation, open the door!‚Äù he yelled, trying to scream over the squawking of the albatrosses which circled the lighthouse, and soon, the pale face of George Ganh appeared in the small window beside the door, and he unlatched it. With gun drawn, Bill slowly entered.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve come to arrest me, federal man?‚Äù George Ganh asked, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll I ain‚Äôt afraid of your jails and courts, I ain‚Äôt afraid you hear me!‚Äù he cried, repeating the last part of his sentence not specifically to Bill but yelling it out to the heavens.

‚ÄúGeorge Ganh, out of suspicion of high treason, you are under arrest!‚Äù Bill exclaimed, ignoring the protestations of Ganh, who was evidently in worse shape than at their previous meeting, and much drunker. He approached the man, keeping his gun trained on him, and tried to force him into handcuffs with his other hand, but Ganh only laughed maniacally and turned around, latching the door.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here! They‚Äôre here! The dead are here! They‚Äôve come to take me!‚Äù George cackled, not out of joy but pure desperation. He stood against Bill in a tense standoff, with Ganh pressing his back up against the door, trying to keep it closed. By now, the sun had fully set behind the horizon, leaving the lighthouse illuminated entirely by the little stove and the rotating light high above. Ganh‚Äôs face was the face of a madman, with every little crease and fold lit up from below, and his eyes, half hidden under his shaggy and unkempt hair, shone with the light of unbridled animalistic fear.¬†

So, Bill Kirtland and George Ganh stood opposite each other, with Bill holding firmly onto his gun, his fingers millimeters from the trigger. Ganh looked straight at him, but he could tell that he did not see him; he was looking straight through him, out the window behind Bill, out to the sea. Taking a very cautious step back, Bill allowed himself a quick glance behind him, still aiming at Ganh.¬†

In the moonlight, which cast a clear silver trail down upon the dark ocean surface, a second, smaller trail of lights could be seen just beneath the water‚Äôs surface. Then the ocean there began boiling, erupting with bubbles, and the string of lights began to rise. Breaking the surface came a sharp point, like the enormous fin of some monstrosity, but he soon realized that it was no fin, but a bow.

Turning back to Ganh, he approached him, trying to handcuff him again. But the old man only smiled, exposing his missing and chipped teeth, and pressed himself even firmer against the door. Suddenly, the silence was broken by a solid, loud knock on the door.

Outside the windows, out of the corner of his eyes, Bill could see dark shapes moving about. Only their silhouettes could be seen in the uncertain moonlight, but there were many of them, and there were the hushed, yet clear sounds of speech between them, but Bill could not make out language nor words.

There came another knock, and another, slowly transforming into powerful blows against the wooden door, which creaked and bent with everyone. Ganh laughed again, a laugh that quickly became a hysterical cry, with tears streaming down his creased cheeks. ‚ÄúForgive me! Have mercy!‚Äù was all that Bill could make out of the words which he heard from Ganh‚Äôs mouth. Then there was another blow on the door, much more powerful than any before. It had sent George Ganh sprawling prostrate on the floor, and the lock had been shattered entirely. Slowly, the door creaked and swung open. What Bill saw next, he would never forget for as long as he lived.

A heavily mutilated body, later barely identified as that of George Ganh, washed up on the shore of a rocky beach just outside of the town of Wood‚Äôs Hole the following morning. An old fishing trawler, with canvas covering the nameplate, was found abandoned and adrift in Buzzard‚Äôs Bay by the Coast Guard, with weapons, explosives, and German military correspondence below decks, but no trace of the spies themselves was ever found. A significant operation was also undertaken to recover all of the bodies of those who died on the USS Hansen, and all of the crewmen were buried with full military honors. A new replacement keeper for the lighthouse was soon found, and Allied shipping continued to pass through Vineyard Sound until the end of the war.

The fledgling F.B.I. ruled it a closed case, and Agent Bill Kirtland was congratulated on his hard work and was promoted for his efforts. Ganh's death was attributed to the crew of a U-boat who decided to eliminate him as a loose end, as well as extracting the spies after the mission had been revealed by the authorities, with Agent Bill Kirtland miraculously surviving by hiding in the lighthouse. At least that‚Äôs what was written in the official reports‚Ä¶

1m6kfke,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m6kfke/why_choose_the_sharp_sdw6757es_dishwasher_for/,Why Choose the SHARP SDW6757ES Dishwasher for Your Kitchen?,"The SHARP SDW6757ES has been my go-to dishwasher for the past couple of weeks, and I‚Äôve put it through its paces to see if it truly stands out in the crowded market of built-in dishwashers. With its sleek stainless-steel finish and array of smart features, this dishwasher promises a lot on paper. But does it deliver? Let‚Äôs dive into my experience.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
I immediately noticed the modern, elegant design of this built-in dishwasher. The stainless-steel exterior adds a polished touch to my kitchen, and the hidden touch panel keeps the interface clean and clutter-free. The LED interior lighting is an absolute boon. The soft white lights illuminate the inside beautifully, offering great visibility, especially when loading the machine at night. Moreover, the smooth-glide rails on the rack feel solid and luxurious. They‚Äôve been a small highlight every time I load and unload dishes.  

**Quiet Operation**  
One of the standout features of this model is its ‚ÄúLibrary Quiet‚Äù operation, rated at an impressive 45 dB. Honestly, you can barely hear it running, even when you‚Äôre standing right next to it. This makes it a great choice for open-concept homes or escapes from the usual clatter of older dishwashers.  

**Responsive Wash Cycles**  
The smart soil sensors deserve a shoutout. These sensors automatically adjust the washing cycles based on how dirty the dishes are, and it‚Äôs impressive how effective they are. I‚Äôve run everything from lightly soiled glasses to a casserole dish caked with burnt cheese, and I haven‚Äôt had to rewash anything. The six washing cycles and additional seven options, like the Half-Load feature, give a good deal of flexibility. I‚Äôve found the Half-Load setting especially handy for smaller post-dinner loads.  

[Find the best price for SHARP SDW6757ES on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b08gfp9zs7/)  

**Heated Dry Function**  
If you, like me, are used to opening a dishwasher and dealing with annoying puddles left on your plastics, the heated dry option is a lifesaver. It‚Äôs fast and efficient in minimizing hand drying, though I‚Äôve noticed it sometimes struggles slightly with certain types of Tupperware lids.  

**Loading Capacity and Organization**  
This dishwasher boasts 14 place settings, which is more than sufficient for my large family gatherings. The adjustable third rack adds a layer of convenience for smaller items like utensils or coffee cups. I was impressed with how effortlessly I could rearrange the racks to accommodate larger pots and pans thanks to the flexible design. My favorite feature here might be the Power Wash Zone, which targets the bottom rack for stubborn grime on cookware. It worked wonders on my skillet‚Äôs stubborn oil stains.  

**Advantages**  
‚Ä¢ Graceful and contemporary stainless-steel exterior  
‚Ä¢ Extra visibility with the LED interior lights  
‚Ä¢ Excellent soil sensors for optimized cycles  
‚Ä¢ Ultra-quiet performance at 45 dB  
‚Ä¢ Versatile loading with adjustable racks  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While the SHARP SDW6757ES has proven itself more often than not, a few minor quirks stand out:  

‚Ä¢ Plastic containers may retain a bit of moisture after drying  
‚Ä¢ The touch panel, though sleek, can be overly sensitive and accidental touches happen now and then  

**Other Options**  
Looking at other products in its category, the Bosch 300 Series stands as a popular contender. Bosch excels in energy efficiency and offers a slightly quieter operation at 44 dB but lacks some features like the Power Wash Zone. On the other hand, Whirlpool offers a similar price point with simpler configurations but falls short in modern refinements like LED lighting and smooth-glide racks. This dishwasher wins for offering excellent functionality with a touch of luxury.  

**Value for Money**  
Let‚Äôs talk about cost-efficiency. This dishwasher delivers a premium feel, thanks to little but impactful details like smooth-glide rails and LED lights. While it‚Äôs not the lowest priced in its range, the features justify the investment. If you‚Äôre ready to splurge a bit for a superior dishwashing experience, it feels worth every penny.

I have been asked to go out for a coffee by my supervisor. Yes, he's my main supervisor, most my shifts I'm with him. He's a nice man, but it makes me super uncomfortable as I can guess his intent of asking me out for a coffee. 
We have quite a friendly atmosphere at work, often I joke with him about stuff and we all (the team) have a laugh about many things. Which actually I really appreciate. He's also a good supervisor and I like having him on the shift. 
I don't mind to go out for a friendly meeting with my coworkers or even him, but if his intent is to date, I'm not comfortable with it. 
Not only because he's my supervisor but also here is 12 years gap (me 31, he's 43), he's divorced and has a kid, where I've never been in relationship, no kids (and no plans to ever have any) and I would prefer someone around my age and my stage of life. Also, because I'm not the first woman he's been texting and asking out, he did that when we was drunk to the previous one (other supervisor). I'm not into alcohol, I'm not into dating people who drink often. 

How to put a boundary in place, without sounding it like I'm imagining God knows what? The first mention about going out for a coffee I have ignored, with the second I excused myself with ""I have no time, busy with work"" which he replied ""I will manage, I will organize it"" which I joked about ""so we will go for a coffee while other will work?"".
I wish to let him know, that friendly coffee is fine, but nothing besides that. I wish whatever I would say would not turn him 180¬∞ to treat me badly at work, for saying no.
How would you handle this situation?

1m6kasm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m6kasm/a_letter_to_my_former_friend_and_roommate/,A Letter to My Former Friend and Roommate,"I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how a five, nearly six year friendship went up in smoke because you decided I was no longer of use to you. The moment I stopped putting in effort, you let the connection fizzle out‚Äînot only that, but you‚Äôre out there saying that connection never even existed. It haunts me that you‚Äôre so delusional and self-centered that you somehow live in a world where everything I and my family did for you didn‚Äôt happen. It worries me that you‚Äôre so clearly unwell, know you‚Äôre unwell, and yet keep refusing help when it‚Äôs offered.¬†

You moved from the east coast to the west coast into the room I offered you. My roommates and I didn‚Äôt ask you to pay utilities/cable/other shared bills your first few months living with us, because we wanted to give you time to acclimate and find a job. We all shared household responsibilities, we cooked for each other, we grocery shopped for each other. Even after the 2 other roommates moved out and it was just you and me, I tried to keep up that same dynamic.¬†

And I know I suck at housework, and have hoarding tendencies, and in general avoided doing the dishes to a near pathological degree. But I did my best, and I was honest, and I tried to be the best friend and roommate I could be whenever possible. I cooked for you when you asked, and offered to share my food even when you didn‚Äôt ask. Any time I was out at a grocery store, I made sure to send you a message asking if you needed me to grab anything for you, or if I was picking up takeout I asked if you wanted anything‚Äîand I never asked you to pay me back unless it was really necessary. I always figured it was a tit for tat thing, because that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs always been with my family and all my other friends. No penny pinching, just ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the coffees covered this time, you get ‚Äòem next time!‚Äù and the like. But you almost never got ‚Äòem next time, even when I asked you repeatedly.¬†

I probably should‚Äôve gotten a clue when, after telling you for the umpteenth time that it hurt my feelings when you go to places I like and don‚Äôt ask if I need anything even though you know I‚Äôd pay you back, you told me ‚Äúasking people if they need things makes me uncomfortable.‚Äù I should‚Äôve realized then that the friendship wasn‚Äôt tenable, never had been. But I didn‚Äôt. I stuck around for another couple years.¬†

Maybe what haunts me most is that I wasted nearly six years on our friendship out of a sense of duty and responsibility. A clearly misplaced sense, if the last nine months have taught me anything. You moved away from your family to a state you‚Äôd never been in before, and I wanted to support you. I didn‚Äôt want you to feel alone. I invited you to most of the events I attended‚Äîincluding all my family get-together‚Äôs and holidays, with my family even going so far as to get you as many gifts as they got me. Whenever the topic of moving out of our too-expensive-for-two house came up, I did the leg work to try and find other options for us. Always *us*. Not once in those nearly six years did I say ‚Äúactually, you‚Äôre on your own‚Äù even though, looking back, I definitely should‚Äôve. I found easy ways for you to get your dog registered as a service animal so we could avoid no-dog-leases and pet fees, but you never actually took the steps needed to complete the process. I offered to do it all for you and you‚Äôd just brush me off. But still I stayed.¬†

I felt like I was responsible for keeping you happy and safe. Your parents certainly intoned as much to me when they visited, thanking me and my family for taking care of you. I didn‚Äôt want to leave you in a lurch, especially not when I knew you got paid less than I did, when I knew you were sending money back home to your family who were in a tight spot. Especially with your pets, who I helped raise and train, I didn‚Äôt want them to be in jeopardy.¬†

So I stuck it out, even as the relationship grew more and more uneven. Eventually I stopped buying you things unprompted, because I knew you‚Äôd never pay it back either in actual money or just in giving me a simple thank you. Hell, you couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to replace the groceries you burned through‚Äîlike the time you ate all the deli meat I bought for my work lunches, before I could make a second sandwich, or when you got through a 12 pack of coca cola in the time it took me to take 1 can. You couldn‚Äôt even be mature about it when I brought it up! When I asked ‚Äúhey, can you not eat all the roast beef I bought so I can use some for my lunches?‚Äù you replied ‚ÄúI just won‚Äôt eat anything you buy ever again.‚Äù Sorry, I thought you were 30, not 3. My bad, I guess. I come from a family where if you eat/drink the last of something, you either let the person who bought it know, or you replace it yourself. But that was too much for you to fathom, apparently.¬†

I even stuck it out when you glommed onto the one friend I had made at my new job and eventually turned her against me

Mind you, this is the same job I later helped you get, because you needed money and it was a solid gig. (Nevermind the fact I was bussing to work and you had agreed that if we both worked there, you would drive us to work since it wasn‚Äôt much further than your existing commute, except when your first day rolled around you said you wouldn‚Äôt be driving us so I had to scramble to figure something out. You never owned up to that either.)¬†

You glommed onto that friend, and we let her move in, and for maybe two or three months things were really good again. We hung out, we did stuff together, it was all pretty great. But steadily it shifted backwards again. Now *neither* of you would pick things up for me, or check in with me, even when I was constantly doing it for you two. You made plans all the time, sometimes right in front of me, and never extended an invite. If I asked to be included, I‚Äôd get a ‚Äúsure, we‚Äôll make sure to invite you next time!‚Äù which of course would never come to fruition. If I expressed hurt over being left out again‚Äîlike the time you two went to see the new *Godzilla vs Kong* movie without me, even though I was the one who introduced you to that series‚ÄîI‚Äôd be summarily told it was unfair of me to expect you to change your plans just to accommodate me.¬†

But I never asked you to change your plans. I only ever asked to be included when possible, and be told in advance so I could take PTO to join, since our schedules were different. But you never did, neither of you did, you just kept making plans and acting like I was the crazy one for wanting to be included. Eventually I just stopped asking. Even when I could hear you sitting in a bedroom together, watching a show we had promised to watch as a household, I‚Äôd just stay in my room or downstairs. Out of sight out of mind for you.¬†

I couldn‚Äôt even ask for a simple ‚Äúhey how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù when someone got home from work/being out. That was apparently too much, crossed a boundary, made me the bad guy for wanting some basic common courtesy in our shared home like greeting each other and civil niceties. I know now that you deliberately drove a wedge between me and that coworker-turned-friend-turned-roommate. That you each fed into each other‚Äôs deluded perceptions of reality where somehow I, as the person managing all of the house‚Äôs finances whose family was routinely paying for trips for the 3 of us and who only ever asked for the barest modicum of respect, was the ultimate villain.¬†

It was never about the money for my family. I was raised to treat the people close to me with respect, love, and care. But now, with how everything has gone down, it‚Äôs sort of about the money. It hurts to know how much my family and I shelled out for you while asking nothing in return, only for you to turn around and say it never happened.¬†

You had no family out here, so my family functionally adopted you. Christmases and Thanksgivings spent together, countless comic conventions where you didn‚Äôt have to pay a cent if you didn‚Äôt want to. We gave you a car for free, and paid for you to get your license in this state. We surprised you with gifts like brand new video games you couldn‚Äôt afford for yourself, and helped pay the vet bills for your dog (y‚Äôknow, the one you spent an impulsive $4000 on, all while complaining about your beloved dog you left behind with your family?) For almost six straight months, you got your nails done with my mom every 2 weeks, with her not only paying for your acrylics but also often feeding you afterward‚Äîand now you have the audacity to go around telling people you never hung out with her one on one?

Not to mention the lying‚Äîreally, honestly, I should‚Äôve known you were bad news when two and a half weeks to living with us you started fucking one of our roommates. It was never the sex that was the issue, we‚Äôre all adults; it was the fact you were shady, manipulative, and lied about it that was the problem. You‚Äôre still complaining about how that Christmas no one ate the cake you made‚Äîspoiler, it was because all of our friends talk to each other, and everyone knew what kind of shit you had pulled, and none of them care about you or your stupid cake. Even then, you were playing the victim when in actuality you just couldn‚Äôt be bothered to face the consequences of your actions. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes, but you just never learned.¬†

Hell, even after we hadn‚Äôt spoken for over a month, you still tried to come crawling back to my mom and guilt her into giving you money. All because you crashed the free car we gave you by driving like an idiot. It wasn‚Äôt the nicest car, it was old, but it ran fine. Just because you never bothered to take it in for maintenance doesn‚Äôt mean my mom owed you anything. I still can‚Äôt believe you tried to scam your way into making her give you money like that. I feel physically sick sometimes thinking about all the money we wasted on you just for you to turn around and treat us like villains or like we never existed at all.¬†

Maybe you‚Äôll learn this time. Maybe now that you don‚Äôt have my family blindly supporting your every whim, and now that you live with someone who isn‚Äôt so easily walked on, you‚Äôll grow the fuck up. Especially since you drove away the one other friend you had. Maybe someday soon you‚Äôll actually live in reality, with the rest of us. Or maybe you‚Äôll keep lying to your therapist and your mom, and you‚Äôll keep finding new victims to prey on, and you won‚Äôt learn a thing.

PS‚ÄîI never told you about the message your mom sent me after we cut ties. I assume you must‚Äôve told her I ditched you, and I can‚Äôt imagine it was kind or anything, but she sent me the sweetest message. She thanked me for looking after you all these years, for giving you a home and taking care of you. She wished me the best in my future. I think she knows you‚Äôre rotten and selfish and delusional, and I think she knows what a burden your behavior is for others. At least she‚Äôs grateful for what we did, even if you never will be.¬†",1,1753205165.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Afterwards, we 'hang out' for another hour drinking coffee/tea/beer. They're about 10 years older than my parents. I find it quite difficult socialising with them. We don't really like the same music, share no workfield background and we have very different views on life/the state of the world/politics et cetera. I am quite interested in learning what life was like when they were younger and they undoubtedly have a lot of experience with 'life hacks', so sometimes when the conversation shifts in that direction I try to dig in to it. 

I think they like talking about their past and sharing their life lessons too. However, I don't really know how to find a topic to engage them in conversation. How can I be more proactive in this?

Edit: I've known them for 5 years now btw. It's not that we don't have conversations. It's just that I don't really know how to lead the conversation. One of them has a tendency to repeat the same story every couple of weeks and he's getting deaf.

1m6k89c,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m6k89c/we_made_wows/,We made wows,"I‚Äôve never been married. Not legally. Not in a church, not at city hall, not even in some drunken Vegas chapel. I checked. And I mean really checked.

I tore through every drawer and box in my attic, flipped through every folder in my Google Drive. I searched my social media, my email, my insurance, the digital graveyards where our lives leave traces. There‚Äôs no record. No wedding. No photos. No certificate. No wife.

But then again, when i told my boss that i needed a few days off for personal stuff last month, he agreed...and asked if shes ok.

When I saw my doctor to refill my anxiety meds, she asked how my wife was doing. Said she looked pale the last time she came in with me.

But I don‚Äôt bring anyone to appointments. I live alone. I am sure of it.

This all started to feel strangely off, as if there was this hole in my life, and something, or someone was quietly filling it behind my back. Not violently. Not even with malice. Just... occupying space I didn‚Äôt give away. Like a cup that always ends up half full, even though you‚Äôre sure you poured it out.

The first time I mentioned her out loud was a reflex. I was in line at the pharmacy and muttered, mostly to myself, ""My wife would lose her head if it wasn‚Äôt screwed on."" The guy behind the counter smiled. Said, ""She was in here last week picking up your prescription.""

I blinked. ""She was?""

""Yeah. We joked about the name mismatch. You go by your middle name, right?""

I do. I always have. Since I was a kid. But I‚Äôd never told him that. Never needed to.

I smiled, paid, and left. I told myself it was a mistake. A mix-up. Maybe someone else‚Äôs wife had picked up meds, and he‚Äôd confused the names. It happens. I wanted it to be that.

Until I got home and noticed the mug in the sink.

I never drink from green mugs. I don‚Äôt even own one, or I didn‚Äôt think I did. This one was pale green with a chipped handle. Not mine. And it was warm.

I havent slept that night. My brain was a mush and my mind was all over the place, thoughts refusing to remain encased in its space. I got up and walked around, talking to myself just chill a bit, to snap out of this state, along that trying to calm my paranoia and checking the obvius...one toothbrush, one pair of slipers.

That night I couldn‚Äôt sleep. My thoughts were heavy and slippery, like trying to hold water in cupped hands. I got out of bed and walked the house in the dark, whispering nonsense to myself just to break the silence. I turned on the kitchen light, opened every cupboard. Nothing unusual. No second toothbrush. No slippers beside the door.

But there were changes. Subtle ones. The laundry folded a little too neatly. The fridge organized differently than I remembered. Nothing dramatic just off.

I started recording myself while I slept.

The first three nights, there was nothing. I was turning in bed,  ocasional cough, snore but then something weird. On the fourth night, in the dead of night, I heard the scrape of a chair moving across the tile. Breathing, soft and slow, near the mic. Then a whisper: ""I love you.""

I don‚Äôt talk in my sleep. And I didn‚Äôt get out of bed that night.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe I got up and forgot. Maybe I was dreaming. Maybe it was something outside. The house creaks all the time.

But the next morning, my neighbor waved and said, ""Tell your wife I found that recipe she wanted. Left it in your mailbox.""

I got thrown off imediately, she didn‚Äôt say it like a joke. It was a stated fact.

I opened the mailbox. There was a folded piece of paper. My neighbor‚Äôs handwriting. It said: ""Hope she likes it! .--Karen.""

But it wasn‚Äôt a recipe for food. It was a crochet pattern. For a baby‚Äôs bonnet.

I don‚Äôt have a baby. I‚Äôve never wanted one. I‚Äôve ended relationships over that. But for the rest of that day, I kept glimpses in my peripheral vision.  Just a small onesie folded on a couch....and a name I couldn‚Äôt say resting just behind my tongue.

Something was wrong.

It was thiat night that  had a dream. We were in a kitchen, sun shining through the windows. She was crying and I was holding her hands.

‚ÄúYou promised,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou made vows.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what I did wrong, but the guilt was destroying me. I woke up like i was grabing for air. The hallway light was on and I didn‚Äôt remember leaving it that way.

At this point i did what always was my safe harbour. I called Darren, my oldest friend. We‚Äôve known each other since we were kids. If anyone could talk sense into me, it was him.

We met for coffee. I told him everything. The mug, the voice, the pharmacy, the pattern. I expected him to laugh, to tease me for spiraling.

He didn‚Äôt.

He looked tired. He stirred his coffee for too long before saying, ""You always do this.""

""Do what?""

""Forget. Pull away. You two were a mess for a while, but then‚Ä¶ it was like something clicked. You were happy. Completely different. And then every once in a while, you‚Äôd get like this again. Like you woke up in a life you didn‚Äôt remember building.""

""You remember her?""

He nodded. ""She came to your mom‚Äôs funeral. And that trip to the lakehouse, remember that? You fought the whole way there. Then suddenly you were inseparable. You said you‚Äôd figured it out.""

""What‚Äôs her name, Darren?""

He stared at me like I‚Äôd grown a second head. ""You‚Äôre not serious.""

""Tell me. Please.""

He hesitated. Looked away and said: ""Stop messing, you need to stop and snap out of it."", and this is when i felt like a slap was coming with that. It never came, but his frustration was real.

That night, I set up cameras. Motion-activated, six total - covering every room, every door, every angle.

At 3:08 a.m., every single one recorded movement.

And every single file was corrupted.

Except one.

The camera facing the basement stairs.

It showed me. Or someone who looked like me. Standing halfway down the stairs. Smiling.

Saying, ‚ÄúWe made vows.‚Äù

I dont remember when i got up, But in the morning I  found a shoebox on the dresser. And inside were photograps.

Polaroids. Dozens of them.

All of her.

Her eyes were always a little off. Lighting too dim. Face sometimes blurred. But she was real. In my arms. In our kitchen. At a park I don‚Äôt remember visiting.

One photo showed her holding a newborn.

The baby‚Äôs face was smeared. Not like a bad shot, like the photo rejected its existence.

The final image was of me. Sitting at my desk. Typing.

And behind me, in the blurry background was her.

I‚Äôm tired of pretending she isn‚Äôt there. Tired of pretending this is something I can explain away. The truth is, I see her now. I feel her. I recognize the slope of her shoulders when she walks past the hallway. The scent that lingers in the bedroom, faint like lavender and smoke. I even remember the way she laughed.

And the more I let myself accept it, the more it makes sense.

Nothing seems wrong with my life. There is no missing time. No mysterious bruises. No flickering lights or messages in blood. Just‚Ä¶ her. Missing from my mind and perfectly present in everyone else‚Äôs.

This isn‚Äôt random. This didn‚Äôt just happen. She did this. Whatever it is, she made it this way.

It feels like she made me forget. As if she let me drift far enough that when I came back, I‚Äôd be scared, unsure, vulnerable. And then she gave me just enough, just one memory, one whisper, one image to reel me back in.

And I came back. I always come back.

I look at her sitting at the table like she‚Äôs always been there, but then something hapeneded. A suden surge of clarity hit and sudenly....

I believe her.

I don‚Äôt understand any of this. It doesen't seem like it's posible to just forget, But I know I did. And I think I‚Äôve done it before.

She smiles when our eyes meet. Not cruelly. Not smugly. Just... like she‚Äôs relieved.

""Welcome home,"" she says with the sweetest voice.

And I don‚Äôt argue.

Because maybe I did make vows.

And maybe she‚Äôs just holding me to them.",1,1753205010.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1m6k84i,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m6k84i/unresolved_affair_36m_with_coworker_31f/,Unresolved affair 36M with coworker 31F,"I've (36M)been with my partner (29F) for 4 years. She's the only person I've been with during that time. We get along well and don't often fight. We make good partners overall but our passion and desire for each other (at least on my end) have faded.

I had a coworker (31F) that was always drawn to me. She would scheme up ways to see me at work, bump into me, get me pulled into a meeting with me. And She'd flirt a bit but I would keep her a distance out of respect for my gf.

Back at the start of the year the company required us to be in the office more. Me and this girl started leaning on each other more. We would message on teams throughout the day. We would walk in talk in the halls. I leaned more into it this time than before. She began to slowly push my boundaries by turning the conversations into my relationship happiness and my sexual habits. She told me about her kinks and her failed relationships and floated the idea of us being a match.

She began showering me with compliments and validation. She would bring gifts and coffees to my desk unprompted. She would get dressed up for me and kept sharing more and more details about life. She inflated my ego like no one ever has. 

This girl put in her two weeks notice and during that period she didn't work at all. She would just spend all day flirting with me and trying to get my phone number ""to stay in contact""

She began sending me pictures of herself and hinting at more. Then she asked for shirtless pictures of me. After we sent these to each other she told me she wanted to fuck. I told her I felt the same. On her last day of work we hung out all day. When it was time to leave she waited at the exit for me as she stood with her best friend and mgr crying.

I walked her to her car. And we talked and hugged. Then I got in her car and we drove off and started talking. We ended up making out with each other for an hour and feeling each other up. It was one of the most passionate intense experiences I've had. 

She texted me that night that she couldn't stop thinking about me and that kiss. She canceled her date the next day. And I was flattered but also nervous that she may be catching feelings even if I was too.


The next monday I showed up to work for the first time without her there. To my surprise she texted me to meet her at the front of the building. She had showed back up dressed up to see me and sneak another walk and kiss.

We kept talking and everytime it started to fizzle she would show back up at work to see me and kiss. She would have gone further but I wasn't ready to blow up my life yet.

After about a month of this and our secret texting only during work hours. She started to pull away. I started to crave all this validation and power I felt having a young attractive girl circle me and drive 30 mins out of her way before work starts just to see me.

I responded by pushing for more. I wanted to finally fuck and get it over with. She pulled back at this. She said she didn't want to since I'm in a relationship and didn't want me to breakup with my gf for her if she couldn't offer more.

This hit me like bricks in the face. This girl made me feel like a God. Then when I finally gave in she no longer cared to have it. I pushed a bit harder and she agrees to meet up but wouldn't commit to a date and kept saying stuff like if I fucked her and left she'd be crushed and she's scared to follow through with it.

I haven't talked to her for a week now. But I'm stuck on the unresolved with her. Whether I would have rather had her than my gf. That I'm still hoping she changes her mind. That I'm guilty that I'm hiding this all from my gf like some middle school kid with his first kiss.

It's pathetic but I want it so bad now that I can't have it. It makes me want to blow up my life.

Anyone  been through this before? Any advice on how to deal with this if I have feelings both ways?

I was posting daily, using all the ""right"" hashtags, and even trying those cringe-worthy follow/unfollow tricks. Nothing worked, my account was stuck at 500 followers, and my engagement was embarrassing.

Then I met another creator at a coffee shop who showed me their analytics. Their secret? They treated Instagram like a conversation, not a megaphone. Here's how I applied that mindset and finally saw real growth:

Stop Chasing Virality, Start Building Connections
Instead of posting and disappearing, I began spending 30 minutes each morning genuinely engaging with my ideal followers. Not just liking posts, leaving thoughtful comments on accounts slightly bigger than mine (10K-50K followers). Within two weeks, those creators started checking out my profile and engaging back.

The Magic of ""Micro-Engagement""
I noticed my best-performing posts all had one thing in common: they sparked quick reactions. So I started using:

""Double-tap if..."" captions

Simple polls in Stories (""Which should I post next? A or B?"")

These tiny interactions signaled to the algorithm that people cared, and my reach exploded.

When I Needed a Boost, I Got Smart About It
Around the 2K mark, growth slowed again. That's when I tried Viral Rabbi. not as a crutch, but as a way to get my content in front of real people in my niche. The increased visibility helped me break through that awful plateau.

The Hard Truth No One Tells You
Your first 1K followers will take longer than the next 10K. The key is consistency with the right strategy. Now I:

1m6jzzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1m6jzzv/conflicting_dr_opinion_of_ekg/,conflicting Dr opinion of EKG?,"Husband (60M) went to ER for similar problem he went for in Sept. 2023. He was feeling weak and trembling and very stressed. In 2023 no signs of a heart attack and a normal EKG. Just said sinus normal.

He just went yesterday and the EKG on MyChart implies (?) he had a heart event since 2023. In additional to feeling weak, he paced around the waiting room for an hour to see if he would calm down. But he walked along a row of chairs to see if he was feeling better but felt 3-4 times he was going to pass out and had to regain his balance.

The first incident the GP wanted to get him a holter monitor but insurance wouldn't pay.

One thing he thinks it may be is hubs' hiatal hernia. Particularly if he drinks a lot of coffee (as did in 2023) and is in a lot of stress, his heart starts racing. He massages his hernia and deep breathes, which works but when he is under real stress, he goes to the hospital or to the GP (he has gone to the GP \*from work\* twice in medium level episodes). They put him on EKG both times and he calmed down since under observation and his bp returned to normal.

One issue is that he's been on blood thinners for years after a PE, so he has swollen ankles and discoloring. Thinking it is from the blood thinners and a sedentary lifestyle. He has now slept with his feet up for a year or two and wears compression socks.

In any event, he is under severe stress. One of our children looks like is going to have an operation. We are worried about college tuition. My job situation sucks. His does too.

He was at work yesterday and made an appointment with his boss at work  for the following day since he is ALSO worried about his job. Then he started feeling anxious and went to the ER mid-afternoon. Heart racing, feeling a bit numb in his right hand fingers, weak legs....but nothing like a sharp pain in his chest or left arm. He could feel his heart beating fast. Rapid deep breathing

Well he calmed down again in the hands of the ER and his bp on admission was normal and pace wasn't racing. Still felt occasional heart racing intermittently he thinks. But he thinks it's psychological that he was going to get looked at.

But after an hour so on the EKG, this is what we got reported out (cut and paste):

From MyChart‚Äôs Test Results section for EKG (with scan): **EKG NORMAL SINUS RHYTHM INDETERMINATE AXIS ANTERIOR INFARCT , AGE UNDETERMINED WHEN COMPARED WITH ECG OF SEP-2023, T WAVE INVERSION NOW EVIDENT IN ANTERIOR LEADS \[ETA: Dr's name listed here as confirming this and I edited out.\]**

After-visit summary:

**We evaluated you with an EKG and blood work which were reassuring that nothing emergent is currently going on that require hospitalization or surgery at this time. You are not having a heart attack and there were no abnormal rhythms on your EKG.**

From Notes from Care Team:

**EKG, on my \[Doctor‚Äôs\] interpretation, reveals normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 66 bpm with inverted T wave in V3 which is new from EKG in 2023, but no signs of acute ischemia; intervals within normal limits. Blood work revealed negative initial troponin, no leukocytosis, INR in the therapeutic range, normal renal function, LFTs within normal limits, mild hypokalemia, but otherwise electrolytes within normal limits.**

So he was discharged. And on the drive to work **today** (going to meet with his boss), he again felt his heart was racing and he began rapid breathing (anxious to get to the parking lot). He got into the building and was able to rest for an hour and a half, still anxious, but calm enough to go to the boss' meeting. That meeting went well and he feels better about his job, though now of course he's anxious about our child's medical bills.

The doctor confirmed the MyChart notation but no signs of acute ischemia, etc. What to make of this? Attached yesterday info. ETA: Dr. said nothing about a past event or anything. So we were stunned to read about this t waves and infarct etc. Nor did he address going to a cardiologist, just go to GP as per normal.

1m6jzst,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m6jzst,NeverMore‚Äô Who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äô with Christina Ricci,"NeverMore‚Äô Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

For as long as Christina Ricci‚Äô a forty five year old brown eyed, dark haired girl! Having the attitude to match! Her gothic charm, that was about her! For as long as she could always remember, remember having a fascination for dark mysterious men. As she then in her mind, saw from deep within the fog and shadows! A man lurking! As he just stood there all dressed up long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee! Just standing there looking over to her. As he then said to Christina‚Äô 

‚ÄúWhy go ahead my dear, and you just say the words! And we shall go from there.‚Äù

As he then just vanished back into the foggy night! Leaving Christina‚Äô even more curious more than ever now. Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair! Knowing that she had always been surrounded by their presence alone. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them.

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person, while at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex! Or just finding herself hanging out with them. Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her, that fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say. Or at least one can try to say, But, Legend has it that on that day in 1849‚Äô when after five days that when they first found him! Being the one and only 

Edgar Allan Poe‚Äô

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown, But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one, Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

‚ÄúWho Killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äô‚Äù

That they just might find out!

But as Christina‚Äô stood there hearing the sounds of darkness all around her, along with the sounds of the Raven‚Äô

Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her! With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer, The same figure was now standing there! Up underneath the street light. 

Standing there as the sounds of a Raven‚Äô Could be heard as it flew by her, as if it was beckoning for her to come. To be and be with him, as Christina‚Äô just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat! Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him! 

As he just stood there directly in front of her! Hearing the sounds of the Raven‚Äô calling out her name. As the darkness grew even around her, But as quickly as he had come,  He was now once more hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina‚Äô now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone, But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe‚Äô

As Christina‚Äô could hear the Raven‚Äô crowing into the nights air. With her just standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night! Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her. One more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her, Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for. As her heart was pounding for more, knowing that once with him! Just wasn‚Äôt enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself, If she really even cared! For they had made their own choice in doing this. But regardless it was Five days, that she will never forget, 

For they will be Never More for her to know.

Never more to know him, And that just wasn‚Äôt good enough for Christina‚Äô as she stood there thinking to herself, Should she say it! Should she say the words, For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! His he could make her feel that way one more time! Then death! Bring your ass on! 

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! She wanted more than just dreams of him! She wanted to feel him again! Even if it was to be

NeverMore!

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe?‚Äù

But Christina‚Äô being a dark haired girl! Having that gothic charm! Knew that she was going to get what she wanted! With her even knowing what happened five nights ago! Even though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone! But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled! By the one! Who could have her being 

NeverMore!

But for now! Shall we go back to five nights prior! Five nights ago when it all started! But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina‚Äô was looking forward to! But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied! 

As she lay there thinking to herself! Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her! After a good night of fucking for him! Just wasn‚Äôt enough for her! Guessing that‚Äôs why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could! 

Always finding them gone by morning! Gone before waking up! As she lay there looking up to the ceiling as she said! 

‚ÄúI swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!‚Äù

Always just to leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it‚Äôs like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It‚Äôs like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I‚Äôm just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass! They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn‚Äôt be God that answered her! But someone much darker! To match her gothic style, Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled. And occasional holding would be nice, But I guess that would be asking too much, For in a way Christina‚Äô would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn‚Äôt much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again! maybe another week or two! Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in!

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina‚Äô stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself! Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl! Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy! Needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I‚Äôm going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn‚Äôt so bad! It gives her the freedom to be free! 

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans! Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes! A pair a converses! And with that! To venture into whatever finds her! And find her something would! Something that she could have never imagined that would be! But imagined is beyond belief! This was beyond death itself!

Making her way out the door of her apartment here the usual get the hell out! From her neighbor, I guess she didn‚Äôt get her feel either! Not even making it off of her floor. When she then came upon a scene that would forever leave her asking? Is death even dead! 

Coming to the end of the hallway seeing a couple of cops standing there, standing there with their dicks in their hands as usual around here. Standing there just outside of jimmy‚Äôs apartment. Jimmy‚Äô was someone that she would talk to every now and then, not as friends! But more like a neighbor. 

For Jimmy‚Äô was into some serious, dark shit! Some Very dark shit! That often had Christina‚Äô questioning at times! As she then stopped to ask one of the officers, just long enough for him to quit holding his dick in his hands. If anything had happened! But as usual the dicks just didn‚Äôt know what ass to look or go up! 

Only knowing the hookers around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn‚Äôt know dick! As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead! As Christina‚Äô then thought to herself 

‚ÄúWell no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!‚Äù

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy‚Äô sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn‚Äôt going to find out, who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch. But as Christina‚Äô then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy‚Äôs body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor.

But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall was the words written 

NeverMore! 

Just then as a Raven‚Äô flew into an open window landing on it‚Äôs bottom frame as it the crowed 

‚ÄúNeverMore!! NeverMore!

Like she said, Jimmy‚Äô was into some serious, dark shit! Walking on past making her way outside, where she would run into another guy. Someone that Christina‚Äô didn‚Äôt mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny‚Äô a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket! Sunny outside or not, With his eyes and hair to match! Someone that Christina‚Äô would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. 

But he already had someone, as Christina‚Äô then thought to her herself, at least Johnny‚Äô knew how to please someone. But as Christina‚Äô then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy‚Äô With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her! 

‚ÄúLook! I don‚Äôt know! Johnny was into some shady shit and stuff! More than likely a drug debt!‚Äù 

With Christina‚Äô then looking to him saying to him in also in a snarky remark 

‚ÄúLook. I know! Well sorts knew Jimmy‚Äô much more she should have known about him! and he wasn‚Äôt into drugs Johnny‚Äô he was into some serious dark shit! But drugs! You don‚Äôt have to be so snarky you know‚Äù

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

‚ÄúLook! The other night me and Jimmy and a couple of other people, who I didn‚Äôt know who they were! went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn‚Äôt kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô then replying 

‚ÄúSomething else! What do you mean something else!‚Äù

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

As Christina‚Äô then looked back at him curious like then saying 

‚ÄúWhat! What do you mean? Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina‚Äô saying to her 

‚ÄúYeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!‚Äù

But as Christina‚Äô then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. Followed by the sounds of the Raven‚Äô

As Christina‚Äô stood there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. As a guy off in the distance was just a shredding away on his guitar! Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

NeverMore 

But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang‚Äô wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. 

Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang‚Äô then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

‚ÄúFor insane I have became! Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

With Chang‚Äô now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang‚Äô

‚ÄúSo a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be!‚Äù 

As Chang‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúWho are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?‚Äù

As the figure then said to Chang‚Äô 

‚ÄúIs it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then replied back saying to him

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!‚Äù

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang‚Äô saying to him

‚ÄúOh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúTell me what!‚Äù

As the figure then replied back to Chang‚Äô saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang‚Äô letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang‚Äô was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina‚Äô not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did! For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would suddenly came into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall behind them were the words 

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed! Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown with being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina‚Äô being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird! 

Just as a Raven‚Äô then flew by them saying to them

NeverMore

But to the scene Christina‚Äô made her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head for it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As Christina‚Äô stood there looking at the words, just as a Raven‚Äô Then Flew by her landing on a railing, crowning

‚ÄúNeverMore! NeverMore!‚Äù

Standing there now looking at the Raven‚Äô just as it then flew off into the day! Leaving the dead person to be, And Leaving her now with more questions than answers, As Christina‚Äô then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city‚Äôs landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders, But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come. So would two more murders, Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny‚Äô! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him.  

‚ÄúThe four other people that was with you and Jimmy‚Äô were they the ones murdered the last three nights‚Äù

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

‚ÄúLook! I was only along the ride! Those other five were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots‚Äù! 

With Christina‚Äô just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

‚Äú Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!‚Äù

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina‚Äô would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city‚Äôs night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style, More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Raven‚Äô then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

‚ÄúI have became insane! to a world that wants to know!‚Äù More than they should know!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut For those who chose not to know, never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed by knowing me‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to know? My love!

As Christina‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúDo I want to know what‚Äù?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40‚Äô with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina‚Äô more enticed than ever, Her eyes and heart were now set into place, with her now wanting more. More than she even dared herself to ask, But resist she could not! For there was just something mesmerizing about him that she wanted more off. A feeling of she needed him, a desire that she just could not hide anymore. Finding herself now wanting to know more of him that night. 

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don‚Äôt want to know?

With her again asking him

‚Äúknow what?‚Äù

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

‚ÄúTo know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know‚Äù

And desired to know more Christina‚Äô did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina‚Äô was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina‚Äôs body was now ready for his touch. A touch that she had been yearning for. To show her what she had been looking for, With him now looking at her as he then said 

‚ÄúTo know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if you need is to feel? Then my desire is to know you.‚Äù

The desire was here, Christina‚Äô thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

‚Äú I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina‚Äô was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina‚Äô heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina‚Äô could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be, But for one night, She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her. For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! As Her body was pulsating, To his very touch. A touch like no other to her. As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

‚ÄúTonight my love I will know you as you desire!‚Äù

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. As Christina‚Äô body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her, slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina‚Äôs cheek, As Christina‚Äô lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding me against her, going in and out her. Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her.

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants! Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

feeling his sweat as he then placed her hands around his back moving them up behind his head. 

Christina‚Äô could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci‚Äô saying

‚ÄúDam! I would give up hell just to be in her!‚Äù 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina‚Äô had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go! 

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina‚Äô asking her

‚ÄúDo you want to know?‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô now looking at him saying 

‚ÄúKnow what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô then asking 

‚ÄúWho!‚Äù

As he then just laughed as he said

‚ÄúI did!

‚ÄúI killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Raven behind her once again crowed

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù 

Just before it flew off into the night!

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina‚Äô even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning, But if so, then Johnny would be

NeverMore!

Leaving Christina Ricci‚Äô then asking herself? Dose she now want to be 

NeverMore herself

The sandwich was a good size, and was filling. The bread was good but not Lee‚Äôs Bakery good. But it‚Äôs also not an hours drive either.

During this visit my father became deathly ill and had been in the ICU since early June. He passed away on 7/17. Throughout all of this I have felt pretty disrespected by them. 

1. They gave me absolutely no personal space when I was home which was maybe 2 hours a day. I was at the hospital 12+ hours a day most days and only came home to sleep. It seemed like a federal issue to them that I would want to have a coffee alone on my deck before heading to the hospital each day. 

2. When my dad passed my father in law commented that it was nice that I was home again to eat lunch with them. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

3. They didn‚Äôt want to attend the funeral because they were ‚Äútoo sad‚Äù and only attended because we told them it was expected and disrespectful if they didn‚Äôt 

4. We sat shiva at my house following the funeral. (I am Jewish). I went to the store to buy cans of soda and waters for anyone who happened to come. His dad watched me make 10 trips to the car and didn‚Äôt offer to help me even tho he was on Facebook scrolling.  This man literally has not even served himself a plate of food in the entire time he‚Äôs been staying with us so this wasn‚Äôt terribly surprising but it still really pissed me off. 

5. They didn‚Äôt attend the shiva and hid in their bedroom. Everyone asked where they were and I found this embarrassing and disrespectful of them. 

6. Yesterday I saw his mom posted a photo of them posing and smiling wearing the clothing they wore to the funeral. She borrowed a dress from me so I know this was taken the day of the funeral. I just found it very hurtful that they would take pictures like this let alone post them online where I can see them.

You know how some people say a small ritual can change your whole mood? I never really believed that... until recently.

I don‚Äôt know how or when it started, but these days, making coffee‚Äînot with a fancy machine, but the old-school fork-whisking method‚Äîhas become the most therapeutic part of my day. The process itself feels almost magical.

There‚Äôs something oddly calming about whisking instant coffee, sugar, and just a little water into this thick, creamy, cloud-like texture. My arm hurts, but my heart? It feels light. And the smell‚Äîgod, the aroma that fills the room? It feels like a warm hug on a cold day.

As a hosteller, I juggle a lot‚Äîclasses, mess food, late-night submissions, and a hundred other things. But I don‚Äôt mind putting in that extra effort when it comes to my coffee. It‚Äôs that one little corner of my day that feels just mine.

Today, I did the whole cold coffee ritual: ‚Äì Whisked the coffee until it turned into this dreamy, frothy paste.
‚Äì Swirled Hershey‚Äôs syrup inside my tall glass (a little messy, but it felt so right).
‚Äì Poured in that creamy coffee cloud.
‚Äì Added chilled milk, some ice cubes.

And the first sip?

Oh. My. God.

I ddnt take the trustan only the antibiotics for a week. Thought i was symtop free and back to my oldself ü§£. One night i went to go pee lifted up my top and noticed im pregnant ü§£ ddnt think much of it and just left it but it continued for months, i had no more hunger noise and my stools was terrible. 

I decided not to go back to the doctor cause i know i would just get more antibiotics, anyways ddnt worry about  my bloating cause it ddnt cause any issues, some days il have nice stools some days i wont. I tried so much supplements costed me so much money but nothing worked. 

3 weeks ago i decided to get this bloating issue resolved. 

This is what im doing and its been working very nicely FOR ME. 

Black coffee in the morning to help bowel movements

Carnivore diet has to be this and no exceptions cook all meat in tallow.
Space your meals like 3 to 4 hours apart 
 
( i am eating a mixture of grass fed meat and processed meat BUT read the label there should be no form of sugar or sweeteners) 

L.reuteri chewable tablets ( i either take it after breakfast or at night if i forget)

Vitamin b12

Oregano oil drops, 2 times a day ( 5 drops in some water ) NB STUFF TASTES HORRIBLE AND HAS A BURNING EFFECT. 

Exercise is good thing to do also. ( 5km treadmill walking, and some weight training especially with all the protein ) 


Its been 3 weeks and my bloating is reduced to 80% after eating.. drinking water after eating would increase the bloating but only for a hour or so until i go pee then its flat again. 

My stool is not yet perfect but its getting there slowly but surely. 

Im not sure if i have sibo or whatever other gut issue but im so happy that my bloating is getting better, i can see my 6pack again ü§£. 

YES carnivore diet is extreme but its sooo nice to not have brain fog and fatigue. The diet is extremely hard for me since im tall and skinny and im loosing abit of weight on this diet, but its either the diet or going on antibiotics and we all know thats a gamble. 

So for the next 2 weeks im staying on carnivore diet, then reintroduce foods slowly back in, i am following the Bi-Phasic diet. 

I KNOW THIS MIGHT NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE BUT IF IT CAN HELP BRING HOPE AND SUCCESS TO ONE PERSON THEN IM HAPPY.

I was dying slowly in the bindery working on those damn machines. I prayed every day: ‚ÄúPlease god, get me out of here.‚Äù There was no way I could do this another two years. I was losing my mind.

I happened to find a picture of an old man with grey hair praying. In the picture, on the table next to the old man were an old Bible, a loaf of bread and a bowl of gruel. It was a cheap print of Rhoda Nyberg‚Äôs famous painting called¬†*Grace*. I have no idea why, but I hung it up in my locker for all to see. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but I‚Äôm convinced that picture saved my life, because a miracle happened.

One day, my floor overseer, Phill Gookenbiel, saw this picture and said, ‚ÄúWhat is this, Brother Casarona? This guy is not a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness! Because that is not¬†*the New World Translation Bible*¬†on his table.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought he was a Witness,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúI thought he was one of¬†*the anointed ones,*¬†celebrating the Passover behind the Iron Curtain and that was the only Bible he could get.‚Äù

Phil looked at the picture again ‚ÄúHmmm.‚Äù as he walked away.

A miracle happened, because I got a job change two weeks later. I had tears in my eyes when they said I was being transferred out of the bindery. I walked up to my line overseer and blew him a kiss. He and the rest of the guys on bindery line 5 looked at me with distain. I couldn‚Äôt blame them, I would have too, if someone else had escaped the slow death that was happening to all of us in the bindery. I‚Äôll never forget the sad look in their eyes, as I walked away from them and their machines. I smiled to myself, as I walked across the sky bridge and out of Hell.

My new job was operator of the east freight elevator that was in building one, 117 Adams street. It was the oldest building of the four factory buildings. The elevator was so old it needed to be operated manually.

I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I could walk around and even go to the bathroom anytime I wanted, and I didn‚Äôt need permission to do so. Plus, I could even spend more than five minutes doing my business in there too. I was my own boss and loving it. Maybe there was a god after all, I thought.

The factory complex consisted of four large buildings. Each building was one full city block in size. My job was to move people and freight from the different floors in building¬†*one.*¬†I also moved freight in front of the different elevators to other buildings by way of the sky bridges that connected all four buildings.

In my building, there was the hand bindery on the ninth floor where they did small, customized book bindery. This was where a lot of the older Sisters who didn‚Äôt want to work as a Bethel housekeeper or didn't fit in the Bethel Home worked there.

Brook Miller, the wife of Harley Miller, was there also. Harley Miller was in charge of the entire service department. Armageddon had taking to long to get here for Brook because she was a full blown alcoholic. But because she was Harley's Miller wife everyone just looked the other way. More about alcohol at Bethel in other chapters.

The eighth floor was storage.

The seventh floor was the linotype and plate department. This is where they made the plates for the rotary presses that churned out dozens of magazines and books. The overseer in the plate department was Warren Manns. On the other half of the floor was the linotype department. Houston Roberts was the overseer there and was my first table head.

The sixth floor was the pressroom‚Äîthe heart of the factory. The pressroom guys knew they were the cream of the crop. They knew all the other jobs at Bethel were there to support them. Like the laundry, it was always hot in the pressroom. This was because the ink needed to be warm in order to work correctly with the paper. Because of this, most of the guys wore shirts with the sleeves ripped off of them. Their clothes were full of oil, ink and sweat. They wore these rags like red badges of courage. That is where I met some of my best friends. Some called them the ‚Äúpressroom animals.‚Äù They were great guys. The overseer there was Richard Wheelock.

Just below the pressroom was the fifth-floor ink room. This was considered the¬†*M.A.S.H. unit*¬†of the factory. These guys got away with murder. These guys even took as many coffee breaks as they wanted. They even had a place where they could hide, where one of them could take a nap as the others were on lookout. The overseer there was Norm Brekke. I thought he was a really cool guy; that is until Jimmy Olson killed himself (more on that later). Norm Brekke would go to bat for his boys, who were called¬†*the inkies.*¬†He did this on more than one occasion.

The fourth floor was the job press. This was were they printed the small jobs like invitations, handbills, assembly programs, etc. The overseer there was Tom Combs, another self-righteous¬†*company man*. Tom always had a smile on his face. The smile was as fake as he was.

On the third floor was the deluxe Bible department. Many overseers passed through there. It was another great place to work.

The second floor was the carpenter shop where Bethel made all of its own furniture: beds, dressers, tables and anything else you could think of. The overseer was Richard Kimble.

The first floor was also a storage area. There were only three of us down there in the basement: David, the elevator operator on the west freight elevator. There was an old man named Davis who ran the giant diesels that supplied all of the electricity that ran the whole factory and me.

The three of us all had lockers together in the basement. The old man didn‚Äôt say much. I don‚Äôt think he said more than a dozen words to us in the two years I was there. He just grunted mostly. I‚Äôm sure he had stories, but he wasn‚Äôt sharing.

I did stumble onto one of those stories after I had been on the elevator for about a year. One day, when things were slow, I decide to clean my half of the basement. It hadn‚Äôt been done in years and there was junk down there from the time of Rutherford. I started sorting things out. After I had moved out a bunch of old oil drums, I found a pallet with what looked like ten old artillery shells. They were about two feet high. It turned out they were brand new pistons for our giant diesel engine. They were buried in the corner of the basement and looked like they had been there for many years. After asking around and going to the machine shop, I found out that they were a ten-thousand-dollar mistake. It seemed that many years earlier, the diesel needed new pistons, which had to be custom made. Someone sent in the wrong measurements and the pistons were too big to fit the diesel cylinders. They were now on the basement floor, gathering dust. I asked Russell Mock, head of the machine shop, if I could get rid of them. The answer was, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill they ever have any use other than as paper weights?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúThey are just scrap metal now.‚Äù

It kind of reminded me of some of the Jehovah‚Äôs Witness beliefs: They don‚Äôt fit, but we can‚Äôt get rid of them, either. I bet when they moved the headquarters out of Brooklyn they were still down there in that spiritual basement waiting for some¬†*new light.*

I remember looking at those pistons and thinking about a little old lady in Salina, Kansas, trying to scrape together a dollar to put in the contribution box. Sorry, I guess we will need ten-thousand little old ladies to cover this mistake. It would take one Bethelite almost 38 years to earn that kind of money at twenty-two dollars a month.

A few months passed. I was getting comfortable again, maybe a little too comfortable. I was starting to lose¬†*some*¬†of my fear of man. However, I knew that the bindery was just one building away over a sky bridge and I could end up there anytime because of an overseer's whim.

Sometimes I would have to go to the bindery to deliver freight. I would walk past some of my old friends like Roy and Jim Pipkorn. They looked at me and never said a word ‚Äì their eyes said it all. We all knew what it was like to be married to one of the machines. I was glad I made it out. Jim would make it out too, just before he left Bethel, but Roy never did. He served his entire time in the bindery.

When the tour groups came through, it was a different story. It was shoulders back and smiling faces. We were Bethelites and damn proud of it. Even if the bastards there were trying to kill us. We were there for god, not man.

I worked hard on the elevator. There was no way I was going back to the bindery. I wanted to be the best elevator operator they ever had. I found out later that they usually only left a person on the elevators for about one year. The reason being, many of the guys would start flaking out after a while. I ended up on the elevators for more than two years. I would have been there longer if I hadn‚Äôt said something.

After about a year on the elevator, I found a small sign that read: ‚ÄúHappiness is not a destination, but a daily way of travel.‚Äù With so many of us counting our days, I thought this would be nice to hang in my elevator. Years later, I finally figured out what those words really meant.

One day, I was standing were they make the glue, which was on the far end of the ink department. I was standing with Mike Stillman and two other guys. I didn't know it at the time but I would end up marrying Mike‚Äôs sister, Debbie two years later.

Mike waved around a big wooden paddle about six feet long. He started to beat the hardened horsehide glue with it. It made a sound like a whip hitting bare flesh. He yelled out, ‚ÄúFeed the rounder.‚Äù The rounder was the cruel machine I had worked on, while I was in the bindery. Then Mike would slap the glue again.

‚ÄúFeed the rounder!‚Äù ..Slap!

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt beat me, brother overseer!‚Äù ‚ÄúFeed the rounder!‚Äù ..Slap!

We all laughed and laughed. Just then, walking up from behind us from the sky bridge was none other than ‚ÄúLiver Lips Linderman"", the overseer of all of building three and the entire bindery! He stood there for a minute, quaking, and finally said, ‚ÄúJust what do think would have happened if it was a tour group that had come over that bridge instead of me?‚Äù

Mike just stood there with a funny grin on his face with his paddle over his shoulder and said, ‚ÄúWell, I guess they would think we were normal, like everyone else!‚Äù

Rule No. 1: Never face down an overseer.

Rule No. 2: Never defend yourself.

Mike‚Äôs words violated both of these unwritten rules. I couldn‚Äôt believe that Mike actually said this to Linderman looking straight at him!

Linderman stood there with smoke coming out of his ears and with a hateful look. He clearly didn‚Äôt know what to say. How dare we stand up to him? He finally said, ‚ÄúYou, you‚Ä¶have done a very bad thing.‚Äù He turned and walked off.

That's it! We are totally screwed, I thought. Bindery here we come. Back to hell!

But no, Norm Brekke, the ink room overseer came through and saved us from all getting shafted back to the bindery. Just like in the movie¬†*Schindler's List*¬†the inkies were¬†*""essential workers.""*

I‚Äôm sure Mr. Linderman would have loved to have gotten his hands on us and put us on one of his machines for a real attitude adjustment.

That is what is so nice about Bethel ‚Äì it‚Äôs the love!

There is an old Bethel story from the 1950's that goes like this:

Phone rings in the fifth-floor bindery. New boy picks it up and says, ‚ÄúThis is Stewflouten‚Äôs sweatshop.‚Äù Stewflouten was the bindery overseer before Linderman back in the 1950s.

The voice on the other end of the phone says, ‚ÄúDo you know who this is?‚Äù

New boy answers, ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is Max Larson, the factory overseer!‚Äù

New boy says, ‚ÄúWell, do you know who this is?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Says Max.

New boy says, ‚ÄúGood!‚Äù and then hangs up.

True story.

Unlike its more famous neighbors, ≈†olta is low-key, authentic, and perfect for anyone who wants quiet beaches, great food, and a taste of local life. You can hop on a ferry from Split (Jadrolinija line 636) and be at the island‚Äôs main port, Rogaƒç, in about an hour. From there, buses, scooters, or bikes will take you to the villages and beaches scattered across the island.

https://preview.redd.it/ucv0v1j6m0cf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c96016aead0690a26a847c1eae1d4898c38c5f31

One of the prettiest spots is Maslinica, a harbor village with a gorgeous marina and a renovated 18th-century castle that now serves as a luxury boutique hotel (Martinis Marchi). It‚Äôs the kind of place where you can have coffee watching sailboats drift by and lose track of time.

Neƒçujam is another great place to relax. It‚Äôs popular with families and has a cool shipwreck just offshore that's shallow enough for beginner snorkelers. Super easy to access and fun for kids too.

If you‚Äôre into food and drink, ≈†olta won‚Äôt disappoint. The island is home to the ancient Dobriƒçiƒá grape (a cousin of Zinfandel), and there are small family-run wineries where you can try it straight from the source. You can also visit the Olynthia Natura mill to sample award-winning extra virgin olive oil with PDO status.

And don‚Äôt skip the Tvrdic honey farm in Grohote ‚Äì they‚Äôve been making honey since the 1930s, and the tour includes tasting and learning about bees. Great for eco-tourism types or anyone who likes their travel with a side of sustainability.

If you want to get out on the water, take a boat trip to the Blue Lagoon near Drvenik Veli. It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like: turquoise water, chill vibes, great snorkeling.

For hikers and cyclists, there are tons of well-marked trails (over 200 km) and great views from the top of Vela Stra≈æa, the island‚Äôs highest point.

Bonus: If you're there in July, check out the Mrduja Tug of War Festival. Locals from ≈†olta and Braƒç hop in boats and literally play tug-of-war over a small islet in the channel. It‚Äôs bizarre and hilarious.

Best time to visit? May, June, or September ‚Äì warm, sunny, and not too crowded.

≈†olta Island = chill beaches, wine & olive oil tastings, honey farm tours, cycling/hiking, and no tourist overload. If you want a real Croatian experience without the Insta-crowds, this is your spot.

Let‚Äôs start with the cold, hard math. Caio Machado (-750 in American odds, decimal 1.33) is the prohibitive favorite here, implying a 75.19% chance to win. Kevin Oumar (+200 in American odds, decimal 3.0) has a 33.33% implied probability. These numbers scream ‚Äúbore-a-thon,‚Äù but let‚Äôs lean into the absurdity.

He‚Äôs the guy who buys the coffee, trips on his shoelaces, and somehow still makes it to work.

The lack of recent news about these fighters is suspicious. Are they reclusive monks? Secret agents? Or just two men who forgot to update their Instagram? No injuries listed, no drama, no ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù comebacks. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre fighting in a vacuum‚Äîliterally, because no air would make sense in this context.

He points out that if I really care about reducing harm, I should also stop consuming other items that involve exploitation or harm ‚Äî like coffee (due to crop deaths and exploitative labor) or even televisions (because they contain small amounts of cobalt, the mining of which often involves severe human rights abuses in developing countries).

To be honest, I partially agree with him. I *do* think we should drastically reduce or stop consuming these things when possible, or at least seek out ethical alternatives. But then he follows up with:  
""We all draw the line somewhere. No one can live without causing any harm. So if you‚Äôre allowed to occasionally watch TV for enjoyment, why can‚Äôt I occasionally go to a steakhouse with friends for the same reason?""  
His stance is that we should all reduce our consumption of meat, dairy, eggs, and honey significantly because of the inherent animal suffering involved, but going full abolitionist makes life overly difficult, impractical, and less enjoyable.

This argument makes me pause. I believe in veganism not as a purity test but as a moral baseline ‚Äî yet his point about consistency, lines we all draw, and occasional exceptions for joy is something I‚Äôve struggled to respond to convincingly.

Personally, I think there is a qualititatively larger amount of violence involved in consuming meat or dairy than watching a television. But there is violence involved in both. I wonder why do we treat buying a TV like such a casual thing. Shouldn't our moral baseline also include not buying TV's?

I consider myself quite cultured for a white Midwesterner, even though I've never left the country, learned a language beyond Pig Latin, or tried many foreign dishes. But if you ask anyone from our side of the trailer park, they'll tell you we were a loud and loving bunch of hippies. My mom did an amazing job of introducing us to different cultures, ideas, races, and religions. The challenge was that there wasn‚Äôt much diversity in our area, so we mostly explored these ideas through books, tv, local Native American powwows, and the eclectic and eccentric crowd at Midwestern music festivals.



My mom often visited a quirky little shop called Strawberry Fields, overflowing with patchwork purses, tie-dye t-shirts, Grateful Dead tapestries, and a variety of paraphernalia labeled for ‚Äútobacco only.‚Äù Most of the time, she would go without all six of us kids, but she always returned with little gifts for each of us. My mom has a knack for finding small and unique treasures. She‚Äôs loved surprising us with them for as long as I can remember. It‚Äôs her love language.¬†



Once, she brought me home this little yellow box that was the size of a hotwheels car. It was in the shape of an oval, and had little red and green symbols all over it. She wouldn‚Äôt tell me what it was until I opened it.¬†



There was a little note folded up neatly, so I picked it up off the pile of miniature dolls. The little piece of paper explained how to use them. It read something along the lines of‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúTell all your worries to the worry dolls, place them under your pillow before bed, and when you wake up all of your worries will be gone.‚Äù



I remember picking up one of the little dolls, and my heart melted at the sight of them. They were no bigger than the tip of my index finger, and I was about seven years old at the time. They were brightly colored, and they were so different from one another. I was in awe of how unique each of them were. I made sure to let my mom know how grateful I was, and I was ecstatic to use them that night.¬†



I loved whispering to my little dolls before going to sleep. I didn‚Äôt do it every night, but I kept them on a shelf in my room and would pull them down when I felt it necessary. They were so small that they would easily get lost, eaten by pets, broken, etc. So my mom would replace them once every so often.¬†



I am now twenty-four and I honestly hadn‚Äôt thought about them since eighth grade when I decided I was too old for worry dolls. The magic of the dolls had died with the Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, and the Easter Bunny. Instead of using them to cope with my negative thoughts, I decided it was time to use a diary in their place.¬†



It wasn‚Äôt until I was at one of the local flea markets that I spotted a blue storage tub amongst all the faded baseball cards, random tools, and three decade old Christmas decorations. It had a piece of printer paper duct taped to the front of it that read ‚Äú$0.50 bin‚Äù written with a magnum sharpie.



My curiosity got the best of me, and I made my way over to the bin and crouched down to get a better look. Faded toys, a few crocheted oven mitts, a set of ugly clip-on earrings, and three packages of unopened worry dolls. I felt the nostalgia flood through me and a smile spread across my face. I grabbed all three from the box and paid the vendor $1.50 for the bunch.¬†



I didn‚Äôt need three boxes of worry dolls of course, but I thought it would be a fun surprise for my mom and little sister. We have family dinners most Tuesday nights, so I kept them in my glove box until the next get together.¬†



They were both happy to see the little dolls again. They didn‚Äôt even need to open the box to know what they were, but they did anyway because we loved seeing each unique doll. They opened them up and neatly laid them side by side in a row on the kitchen table.¬†



There was one with a striped skirt and a purple shirt , another with a blue dress and a yellow poncho, and a few little guys with pants and t-shirts. They all had the same black hair that was made out of sand and black paint, but all uniquely designed. They thanked me for the gifts and we all promised to try them out that night to see if they really worked.



I went home that night and opened my package that had been sitting in the car for two days at this point. I placed the yellow box on the side table next to the bed and stared at it with a sentimental smile as I thought about what I might tell the dolls about.¬†



I carefully took the lid off, grabbing both sides with my thumb and index finger. I dumped the contents of the box out on the night stand and quickly noticed that something was off. I flinched because I thought whatever was inside was some kind of creature.



I know that sounds crazy, but the meaty sounding thud it made when it hit the wood was disturbing. I just stared at the thing for about thirty seconds to make sure it wasn‚Äôt going to move. Slowly, I sat back up and nudged it so that its ‚Äúface‚Äù was upward. This didn‚Äôt help my growing anxiety by any means.¬†



Yea, it resembled a worry doll, but it was thick, dark, and sickly looking. The usual sand and paint that was used for the hair was replaced by a little tuft of what looked like real hair from a human or an animal. Its little outfit was not colorful, but a black cloak that covered its whole body and was made of some woven fabric similar to what is normally used for these kinds of dolls.¬†



The most disturbing thing was the face. Rather than having eyes and a mouth painted with black ink, it appeared as if someone had hollowed out the features from a piece of ham. The color resembled pale skin, with thin, vein-like patterns running across it. My brow furrowed in confusion and disgust. Why did mine look like that? Both my mom and my sister had completely normal dolls.¬†



Instead of touching it, I decided to take a picture to send to my sister. I wanted to get her thoughts, and maybe even joke about how creepy it was. I pulled my phone out and opened up the camera. I leaned over the doll and snapped a few pics before switching over to our messages. When I pulled up the photo tab, the pictures I had just taken weren‚Äôt there. It was like I had never taken them.¬†



I backed out to make sure they weren‚Äôt in my camera roll and possibly not loading, but they weren‚Äôt there either. Not even in my recently deleted. I tried again to take the picture, but this time I did it in the message app. The picture took, but it was really bright, like someone was shining an industrial flashlight at the thing. I still tried to send the picture, but it just kept giving me an error message.¬†



I gave up, believing my phone needed an update or something, but I was too lazy to check and was honestly more interested in the thing sitting in front of me. I finally decided that it was harmless because it hadn‚Äôt moved or anything. It just creeped me out in my quiet house.¬†



I slowly reached out to grab the doll while unconsciously holding my breath. I brought the doll closer to my face and examined it closer. I remember saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a creepy little thing,‚Äù with a grimace on my face. It was such an odd thing. And I wondered why only my box had one doll that was bigger than normal.¬†



I thought maybe it was some kind of special edition thing, but realized that would be really weird considering they weren‚Äôt necessarily a hot commodity. Who would seek out a special edition worry doll?



I decided it was best to stop asking questions and just try to use the thing, like I had promised my mom and sister. I thought maybe the doll would grow on me eventually, considering I have a soft spot for horror movies and creepy props.¬†



I set the doll down for a moment to get comfortable under the covers before holding it up in front of me. I thought for a moment and decided I‚Äôd just share one worry. It was only one doll after all, and generally you tell one worry to one doll. That‚Äôs why they tend to come in groups or pairs.¬†



I spoke the words out loud, ‚ÄúI just want a fulfilling job.‚Äù



I had recently gotten a job as a dental assistant with a well known dental corporation. They paid well over the normal wage for assistants in my area, but the dentist was a terror. I assume they needed to put someone in golden handcuffs so they could keep their turnover rates under control. Doctor Selepka. He was a large and imposing man who was horrible to his patients and his staff. He would grab us by the arm forcefully if we weren‚Äôt looking in the mouth at the ‚Äúright angle‚Äù. He would forcefully shove patients' heads back on the chair before doing any exam. Other times he would get in screaming matches with other male patients who wouldn‚Äôt put up with his shit.



All that being said, it had only been two months, but I was losing my mind with this disgusting excuse for a man. I came home in tears on a daily basis for a plethora of reasons. This doll thing was worth a shot at least. Even if to just say the words out loud. Speaking your intentions as they say.¬†



I tucked the oddly textured doll under my pillow and snuggled into bed. It didn‚Äôt take long for me to fall into a deep sleep.¬†



I slept like a rock. It was one of those sleeps that makes you feel like you time traveled to the next day. I woke up in the same position that I fell asleep in, which made my body so sore.¬†



I rolled out of bed, groaning and rubbing my stiff muscles. I had honestly had enough of this job, and just whispering to the little doll about my worries, kinda made me realize how badly things had gotten. I wasn‚Äôt going to quit right now, because I needed the money, but I figured it would be fine to call in for just one day. It was a Friday, so I decided to give myself a three day weekend. My mental health needed a break.



I sent a half hearted excuse about not feeling well and¬† got a half hearted ‚Äúfeel better‚Äù from my manager. I started my morning like any other weekend. Freshen up, Coffee, comfy clothes, Youtube.¬†



I plopped down on the couch and turned on my favorite podcast before deciding I should call my sister to fill her in on everything. I held down the power button to activate Siri and said, ‚ÄúCall Sissy‚Äôs facetime,‚Äù I waited for a moment before she answered. The sound of screeching children in the background filled my living room. ‚ÄúHunter! Stop hitting your brother!‚Äù she shouted before turning her attention to me.¬†



‚ÄúSorry, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù She said with an exhausted smile.¬†



‚ÄúSorry to bug you, I just wanted to tell you about what happened last night. You know those worry dolls I got us?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúYea,‚Äù



‚ÄúWell mine looks super weird,‚Äù I said with a nervous giggle.¬†



‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù she asked, raising an eyebrow.¬†



‚ÄúThere was only one doll and it's really weird looking. It‚Äôs bigger than normal and feels fleshy. It looks like something from a horror prop store,‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúLemme see,‚Äù she said, looking more disturbed than before.¬†



‚ÄúI tried sending pics last night but they wouldn‚Äôt load, or take. I‚Äôll see if I can get it to work,‚Äù I flipped my camera to face the floor as I got off the couch and walked to my bedroom. I grabbed the corner of my pillow and flipped it up for dramatic effect, but paused. The doll was gone.¬†



My sister didn‚Äôt say anything for a second, most likely confused. ‚ÄúBro I swear to god I put it under my pillow before bed.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúCheck under your bed or maybe you kicked it under the sheets somehow.‚Äù¬†



I tore my bed apart looking for the silly thing, but there was nothing. ‚ÄúHey, lemme call you back,‚Äù I said before hanging up abruptly. I turned over to my side table and grabbed the little yellow box. It had weight again. ‚ÄúMaybe I put it in here and didn‚Äôt remember,‚Äù I thought to myself. I took the lid off and was astonished to see a completely new doll sitting inside.



She was dressed in a similar black cloth, but wore a little black flower crown on her head. There was a miniature skull placed right in the center of the crown. Her hair also appeared to be from a living thing, not sure what, but her bangs were much more well kept than the last doll. A straight across cut, each black hair in its place. The thing that really creeped me out was her face. She had the same hollowed out eyes, but her expression wasn‚Äôt blank. She was frowning and crying‚Ä¶ tears of blood.¬†



I instinctively lifted my index finger to touch the blood. It was wet. Fresh red blood dripping from her right eye and pooling in the other. I whimpered and set it back down. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I whispered to myself.¬†



I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if this was some sort of prank, the only problem with that is, I don‚Äôt don‚Äôt have many friends outside of my immediate family. My mom has never been into pranks, in fact, she got pretty upset the few times we ever pulled any on her as kids. My sister was busy raising two kids and lived at least forty five minutes away. My other siblings didn‚Äôt reach out much, so I was stumped.¬†



I decided that this must be something supernatural. And I know, most people would look for any other explanation, but like I said before, I was raised around some of the most eccentric people you could imagine. I am a believer in the paranormal at the very least.¬†



I paced from the living room to the bedroom, periodically checking to see if it moved at all. It stayed put as my mind raced.



¬†A few moments into my panicked pacing, my phone rang. The caller ID read ‚ÄúAddie,‚Äù my boss's name. I rolled my eyes, realizing she was probably going to beg me to come in or something stupid. I answered anyway because I‚Äôm a pushover.



‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, trying to mimic a tired, sick person.

¬†

‚ÄúHey girl,‚Äù the sounds of smacking gum violated my ears, ‚Äúsomething crazy just happened.‚Äù My brow furrowed in confusion although I knew she couldn‚Äôt see it.¬†



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúDr. Salepka died this morning,‚Äù she stated bluntly, as if she was telling me what she ate for lunch.¬†



‚ÄúWhat? What-How?‚Äù I sputtered in shock.



‚ÄúJane found him in his pool. Apparently it was pretty bad. His guts were everywhere like an animal attack or something,‚Äù



Jane was the dental hygienist that the doctor had been hooking up with in ‚Äúprivate‚Äù but it was no secret. They rode to work together every morning and went out for drinks nearly every night.¬†



‚ÄúOh my god‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs insane Addie. Is Jane okay?‚Äù I asked, very concerned about her mental state after seeing something so gruesome.¬†



‚ÄúShe was pretty freaked out when she called me, but she said she‚Äôs still coming in on Monday,‚Äù I scoffed at her disregard for the situation.¬†



‚ÄúOkay Addie, I‚Äôm still not feeling well so I‚Äôm gonna go rest up so I can be there Monday too,‚Äù I retorted passive aggressively knowing she wouldn‚Äôt even catch it. I hung up before she could respond and sat down on the couch with my head in my hands.¬†



Images of Dr. Salepka‚Äôs dead body kept flashing in my mind. I hadn‚Äôt seen it of course, but my mind painted me a pretty vivid picture regardless of if I wanted to see it. I hated the man with a burning passion, but this was insane. My mind couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if the doll had played a part in this or if it was just some crazy coincidence. I decided it was the latter.¬†



Before I went to sleep that night, I decided to put the lid back on the box. I placed it on the top of my bookshelf. Out of sight, out of mind.¬†



That night I had some of the most vivid dreams I had ever experienced in my life. They all related to yesterday's events, but it was in such a positive light. I dreamt about what work might be like without him around. I imagined how much anger and negativity had left the world with just one person. It made me feel‚Ä¶ happy.The whole time it felt like I had taken ecstasy. It was an intoxicating feeling that I was honestly sad to wake up from.¬†



When I woke up that morning, I felt so refreshed. Like someone had washed my brain with sunshine and cool water. I smiled as I did my weekend, morning routine and found myself humming and bouncing around the house.¬†



When I turned the TV on to youtube, I saw one of my favorite True Crime channels had posted a video. Something about the title made me remember what had happened the day before. My heart sank for half a second, but it dissipated quickly. It‚Äôs like my brain knew it didn‚Äôt want to feel sorry. A part of me felt like it was my fault, and I was somehow proud of it. It makes my skin crawl just thinking about it now.¬†



As of now, I will keep the doll on the shelf until I get some suggestions as to what I should do.¬† Does anyone have experience with these specific types of dolls? I‚Äôll link some drawings I made of the dolls so you can get an idea of what they look like. Any advice would be appreciated, so thank you in advance. Until next time.

1m6jhcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInReviews/comments/1m6jhcy/how_does_the_cuisinart_cmw100_microwave_compare/,How Does the Cuisinart CMW-100 Microwave Compare in Performance?,"I decided to give the Cuisinart CMW-100 Microwave Oven a try because, let‚Äôs face it, my old microwave was more of a glorified plate heater than a cooking device. The brushed chrome finish and sleek design caught my eye immediately, and I wondered if its performance would live up to its aesthetic appeal. Using it for several weeks now, I can confidently share my honest take on its quality and functionality, along with its ups and downs.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This microwave is a bit of a show-off, and I mean that in the best way possible. The brushed chrome exterior paired with the embossed Cuisinart logo gives off a very premium vibe. It‚Äôs a looker in my kitchen, which, let‚Äôs be honest, makes me feel just a tad fancier than I probably am. The stainless steel interior takes things up a notch. It not only resists odors but is ridiculously easy to clean‚ÄîI accidentally overcooked some fish one evening, and to my surprise, the interior cleaned up without leaving any lingering smell. With dimensions of 20.5 x 15.25 x 12.8 inches, this microwave fits neatly on my countertop without devouring the available space, despite its one-cubic-foot capacity. That rotating 12-inch glass turntable? Big enough for most plates and bowls I own, yet not so large that it becomes cumbersome.

**Performance and Functionality**  
This microwave packs a good punch with its 1000-watt power output, unlike my previous one, which sometimes felt like it was powered by a hamster wheel. It heats things quickly and evenly. From reheating leftovers to cooking bagged popcorn during family movie nights, I‚Äôve had consistent results. The 25 preprogrammed settings are a huge plus, removing nearly all guesswork. I found myself relying a lot on the preset for defrosting. I‚Äôd previously taken thawing frozen chicken as a test for any microwave, and to my surprise, this microwave did it evenly without cooking the outer layer (a problem many others have). There are 10 adjustable power levels, allowing for versatility in tasks ranging from warming up coffee to cooking meals.

**Ease of Use and Features**  
The touchpad controls with LCD are intuitive and don‚Äôt require an engineering degree to figure out. I particularly appreciated the two-stage cooking feature. This let me combine defrosting and cooking into a single operation, making my weekday dinners a little less hectic. Another handy feature is the eight preset options with serving-size customization‚Äîperfect for those days I‚Äôm too lazy to think about cooking times. It‚Äôs worth noting that the stainless steel interior really holds up to its claim of being easy to sanitize. A simple wipe-down after use is all it takes to keep it pristine.

**Merits**  
- The sleek brushed chrome exterior adds a modern feel to any kitchen.  
- Stainless steel interior ensures odor-free cooking and simplifies clean-up.  
- 1000-watt power output ensures efficient heating and cooking.  
- Two defrost functions (by weight and time) provide flexibility.  
- Compact yet spacious design with a 12-inch glass turntable.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The brushed chrome finish, while attractive, shows fingerprints easily.  
- No interior light when it‚Äôs not actively cooking, which can be a bit inconvenient at times.  
- The door requires a bit more force to close; it‚Äôs not as smooth as I‚Äôd like it to be.  

**Other Options**  
I compared this microwave to a couple of competitors, particularly the Panasonic NN-SN686S and Toshiba EM925A5A-SS. The Panasonic offers a sleeker design and slightly more power at 1200 watts, making it better for heavy-duty cooking. However, it lacks the two-stage cooking option, something I‚Äôve grown fond of on the Cuisinart. On the other hand, the Toshiba model is cheaper and smaller. Still, it doesn‚Äôt feature the stainless steel interior, so clean-up after stubborn spills or strong-smelling foods might be more of a challenge. Between the three, I‚Äôd say this microwave hits the perfect sweet spot for mid-range functionality and ease of use.

**Price Performance**  
Considering the Cuisinart CMW-100 is packed with features like preset cooking options, two-stage functionality, and effortless cleaning mechanics, it delivers impressive value for money compared to others in its range. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest microwave on the market, the quality, durability, and solid cooking performance justify every penny. Over time, the time saved by preset and defrosting functions alone makes it worthwhile. If you‚Äôre looking to upgrade, this model won‚Äôt disappoint!

It will mainly be letters but I‚Äôm open to whatever else if you choose and we can communicate with that. Even email but I‚Äôd love the feel and way of just regular letters!



I love being out in nature, and I definitely love the beach I‚Äôm just exploring new things. I‚Äôm a fan of sweet coffee and boba. My favorite food is sushi and I love a lot of cuisines. I‚Äôd prefer maybe to receive a letter first as I‚Äôm occupied and can get a chance when I can to write one back! You‚Äôre free to DM me or comment below if you‚Äôre interested and I will try my best to get back!

This one is loooooong and juicy. 

Context: I always host the big Thanksgiving dinner . I cook EVERYTHING. If I do not host, Thanksgiving dinner does not happen. My family is always out of town and my hubs family just doesn‚Äôt do it. So after a couple of years of nothing, I decided if I wanted it I needed to create it. Sometimes my MIL brings dessert or a loaf of bread, which is nice, but I literally do all the hard work. Turkey, stuffing, casseroles, desserts, mashed potatoes, gravy, everything. 

We like to go to my parents second home, 2 hours by car away, I make a huge Thanksgiving dinner, and we eat leftovers for days afterwards so I don‚Äôt have to cook again. So sometimes I cook earlier in the week, this particular year we decided on Thanksgiving dinner Monday so we could relax and eat the rest of the week. 

About 4 years ago, I worked a 12 hour shift on a Friday, then sold my handmade items at a craft show all weekend, then on Sunday evening, exhausted, I packed the car with all the food we need, everything we needed for our 2 kids, and off we went on our short car trip to our Thanksgiving celebration location. On the way to the home, my husband informs me that not only has my MIL been invited to our little getaway and dinner, spending the night, but also Dan‚Äôs aunt is coming because MIL doesn‚Äôt want to drive 2 hours by herself. I am irritated, and now stressed about having enough food and sleeping arrangements, but I generally like his family so I keep my thoughts to myself. 

I wake up at 6 am in order to get the turkey into the oven in time for a noon dinner. Hubs has reassured me that MIL and Aunt will be at our home at noon, expecting a full Thanksgiving dinner. This year no one else brought anything so I was in charge of everything including desserts. And after working 3 shifts in a row I have nothing prepped. So I cook and clean, because now they need bedrooms, all morning, still exhausted from the last few days but wanting to create a wonderful dinner. 

Everything is ready by 12. I managed somehow to get it all done. 
No MIL and Aunt. 
12:30 still no guests. 
Hubs calls them, turns out they are going to be late because they stopped for coffee and then were hungry so they STOPPED AND ATE LUNCH. He‚Äôs mad and appropriate to the situation asking the obvious why? The food here is ready. No good answer. 

1 PM, the MIL and Aunt arrive, my two kids (6F and 4M) are starving and cranky so we eat right away. You would think that they wouldn‚Äôt eat much since they went to lunch at a cafe, but this was NOT the case. 
Now listen I love to eat and I can pack it in but I have NEVER seen old ladies (70s) eat so much. I made 10 pounds of potatoes, had a 13 pound turkey, made 16 crescent rolls, and they ate ALL the crescent rolls and mounds of food. Please don‚Äôt judge me, I wanted them to eat, but the whole entire plan cost and shopping wise, was for this meal to be huge and last us a few days at least. No longer was this possible. But I love hosting and am glad they enjoyed themselves. And maybe I‚Äôm sheltered or something because I have never seen people eat so much. 

Now starts the cleanup. I am so exhausted I am guzzling coffee and having trouble thinking straight. No one else lifts a finger to help. I wash pots and pans and run the dishwasher twice. No one, including my husband, helps me. I just keep cleaning and decide that it‚Äôs important for my hubs to spend time with his family. 

3 pm: where is dessert? I serve pumpkin pie and homemade cookies. Keep cleaning.

5pm: I make popcorn and a fruit tray figuring we only need some snacks after a giant lunch and dessert. Everything enjoys them. 

6pm: my MIL and Aunt want to know what‚Äôs for dinner? üò≥ Like how? And what? My husband is the best and here he says leftovers. If you want anything more to eat go heat up your own leftovers. The kitchen is fully cleaned at this point. 
MIL and aunt proceed to get out every single dish, dirty a ton of plates and spoons, and heat up their food in the microwave UNCOVERED so the microwave is absolutely destroyed. I want to cry. I start cleaning again. I run the dishwasher a 3rd time. 

9pm: I put the kids in bed. By myself because hubs is busy with his family. I am trying not to lose it. I am very type B and usually chill but this day has me on edge. I tell everyone I am going to bed I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm exhausted. I go to bed. 

9:30 pm: For context the bedroom I was staying in is right beside the TV room in this home. My MIL and Aunt decide they want to watch Jurassic World on FULL VOLUME because they are old and hard of hearing, of course it is super loud I cannot sleep. I start crying. Sobbing. I cannot cope. 
To my shame I do text a friend venting and I wish I had not done that, it‚Äôs not classy, but I am beside myself and cry until they are done with the movie and finally fall asleep. I don‚Äôt know what time that was. Around midnight if you look at my texts. 

6 am day 2: I am awakened by the flushing of the toilet. Of course my bedroom is also next to the small downstairs bathroom. There is a large gorgeous upstairs bathroom but ok choose this one I guess. I will not go into detail but I have to cover my head under the covers to hide my nose. I cannot fall back asleep. I hear banging from the kitchen. I just give up and go out to see MIL trying to make coffee. Whatever she did to the coffee maker I cannot figure it out and we have cold not really brewed coffee. 

8 am: I make cinnamon rolls and serve breakfast. I also clean. I am so tired but am moving in autopilot because this is my lot in life now. I‚Äôve accepted my fate. 

10am: MIL and Aunt want to know what‚Äôs for lunch. Hubs again steps up and says leftovers. That‚Äôs what we eat when we do this trip. Leftovers. Inside I‚Äôm panicking because I know good and well there is not enough leftovers to feed them but figure I‚Äôll cross that bridge when I get there. 

At this time MIL and Aunt decide they‚Äôre leaving earlier than they were going to so they can go back to the same diner they had lunch in the day before because they don‚Äôt want leftovers. This is fine with me, I‚Äôm hoping to take a nap. 

As they are packing Aunt falls down the stairs. It is scary and a bit embarrassing and she cries. This trip is not going well for anyone apparently. 

They leave. I cry. Hubs is confused. We order pizza. 

The worst part of the whole thing: my husband saw the venting texts I sent at 11-midnight to my friend complaining about my MIL and the Aunt. He was not pleased with me and I don‚Äôt blame him. He also said if I needed help to just ask. But part of me will always defend myself because this was the WORST Thanksgiving and I‚Äôd rather pull out my toenails than live through it again. Thought y‚Äôall would enjoy. 

Love you Charlotte. I miss naked man. 

Edited to add: my husband and I do not sleep in the same room at this home, he doesn‚Äôt like that mattress, so he had no clue about the crying and staying up and getting up early. ",4,1753203215.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,10,0.83,False
1m6jeis,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m6jeis/should_you_buy_the_oxo_brew_9_cup_coffee_maker/,Should you buy the OXO Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker review today?,"I‚Äôve been hands-on with the **OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker**, a machine that promises to elevate your at-home brewing experience. It‚Äôs impossible not to admire the alluring design and user-friendly features, but as with anything, there are aspects worth celebrating and some to potentially take into account if you‚Äôre weighing your options.

**Sleek and Efficient Design**  
This coffee maker‚Äôs silver and black stainless steel exterior is stunning and modern. It doesn‚Äôt just look great on my countertop‚Äîthe build feels exceptionally durable. With dimensions of 8.3""D x 15""W x 17.2""H, it‚Äôs not wildly compact but fits in snugly on a standard kitchen counter without overwhelming the space. I particularly appreciate the ergonomic carafe, which pours cleanly with no drips‚Äîmajor win for avoiding coffee messes! The silver finish gives off a sophisticated vibe, making it an attractive addition to any kitchen.

**More Than a Coffee Maker**  
It genuinely feels like this product was designed to meet every brewing need. The programmable timer is something I didn‚Äôt know I needed until this machine delivered it perfectly. Waking up to fresh coffee in the morning? Pure bliss. I‚Äôve tested the pause-and-pour functionality during my rushed mornings, and it‚Äôs a lifesaver. Grabbing a cup mid-brew without the risk of spillage? Absolute game-changer for multi-taskers.

**Key Benefits**  
- BetterBrew‚Ñ¢ technology keeps coffee rich and flavorful by controlling water temperature and optimizing the brew cycle.  
- The double-wall stainless steel thermal carafe ensures that my coffee stays hot for hours without tasting burned.  
- Internal mixing tube guarantees consistency in flavor from the first sip to the last.  
- SCA certification sets it apart as a gold-standard home brewing appliance.  

[Check OXO 8710100 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00yeykk8u/)

**A Few Hiccups Along the Way**  
Not everything is perfect, though, and there are elements worth discussing. While I enjoyed the user experience overall, setting the initial programming took more trial and error than I expected. The dial mechanism gets the job done but feels slightly outdated compared to touchscreens or advanced coffee maker controls. Additionally, this model uses paper filters, meaning you‚Äôll have to keep a stock on hand at all times‚Äîlikely fine for some but mildly inconvenient if sustainable brewing is a priority for you.

**Areas of Concern**  
- The use of paper filters may be a limitation for those who prefer reusable options.  
- Programming the settings using a dial sometimes feels less intuitive than newer digital interfaces.  
- Its size might not suit compact kitchens or smaller counter spaces.  

**Performance Meets Functionality**  
Having tested this over several weeks, I can confirm it does a fantastic job at brewing coffee within the perfect temperature range (197.6-204.8¬∞F). My coffee tasted significantly better when compared to the budget drip machines I‚Äôve previously used. The rainmaker shower head evenly spreads water over the grounds, ensuring full flavor extraction with every brew. It‚Äôs little details like this that leave a lasting impression.

**Product Competitors**  
When comparing this coffee maker to higher-end models like the Technivorm Moccamaster or more entry-level options such as the Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker, the OXO Brew stands uniquely in the middle. The Moccamaster certainly edges it out with slightly faster brewing and a more premium feel, but you pay a steep price for those refinements. On the other hand, compared to the Ninja, the OXO shines in terms of achieving better water temperature control and delivering a cleaner overall brew. The decision really comes down to what features matter most to you‚Äîpure coffee quality or additional gimmicks like single-serve compatibility.

**True Value**  
This coffee maker‚Äôs price falls within what I‚Äôd consider the ‚Äúaffordable luxury‚Äù range. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest model on the market, the curated features you get (SCA certification, temperature precision, internal mixing tube) justify the investment. The double-wall stainless steel carafe alone saves you from needing to reheat your coffee throughout the day, adding to its value. Having tested machines at both lower and higher price points, I can confidently say this one offers the right balance of quality and performance for most coffee enthusiasts.

My friend and I are planning this trip. I am in a stock jeep, he is in a 4-Runner. We have offroad and outdoor experience along with some light recovery gear. We will be using OnX Offroad to help guide us and find camping. We are sticking to fairly siimple trails. The idea is to drive a bit but leave plenty of time for hiking fishing and general outdoor fuckery. 

What would you do different? 

We are leaving out of Woodland Park headed to the Grottos trailhead and probably camping around Aspen on Day 1

Day 2: Leave Aspen, head up to Deep Lake area via Coffee Pot Road

Day 3: Leave Deep Lake, catch the BDR near Radium hot Springs up to Steamboat. We will take the Buffalo pass trail up to the summit area and camp there

Day 4: Finish Buffalo pass and head down to Red Dirt Resivour via the Red dirt roard and camp there. 

Day 5: We have built a day of slack into the schedule in case we want to stay or chane our plans.

Way too many and I always failed to reach a level where I was able to do anything with the stuff I already learned. I tried different tutorials (udemy, coursera, books and right now I'm on data camp.

I don't have a big WHY for why I want to learn to code with python. It's more that I'm fascinated by the fact that I also could create something that's a product of my mind. A small automation or a small app that can do this or that. And I believe that because of the missing WHY or a real need to learn this skill I fail on this journey.

Now I'm thinking about joining a coding group with like-minded beginners, who are on a similar path. Do you know of one? Just to have some people to talk to, to exchange ideas, or solve challenges together. I don't know if this will help me to achieve my goal but I really hope that this is what is missing. 

Because no matter how often I stop coding (or learning to code) a few weeks or months later I just get back into the seat and start over again. I'm not able to get rid of my wish to learn it. I don't know if this might sound childish to you, but I really want this but I'm somehow stuck at the same time. 

I don't believe that it matters which tutorial I'm watching. I believe that I struggle to grasp the concepts of programming. Whenever I have to solve a challenge by myself, like to write code for a coffee machine (udemy: 100 days of code in python) I'm lost. I understand that I need to write some functions  which do different things, but I can't wrap my heady head around it. When I follow the solution everything makes sense to me, but doing it by myself feels impossible...

I don't know how to approach this.  Do you know of any groups I could join? Or is it simple to keep going until it makes click...?",19,1753203022.0,learnpython,22,0.89,False
1m6jaxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1m6jaxu/sorce_perfume_sample_reviews/,Sorce perfume sample reviews!,"This was my first time ordering from Sorce, so I wanted to record and share my thoughts! These samples are all in the 2ml alcohol-based spray format.

Strings of Light in the Forest üå≤
- Notes: vanilla milkshake, vetiver, lavender, beeswax, amber, ambroxan
- Starts off very creamy and the lavender and vetiver come through to make it a bit herbal.
- The dry down was surprising to me. It smells like an autumn day: dry leaves and hay, some kind of spice like cinnamon, and holding a hot chai latte
- Reminds me a bit of Harvest Mouse from Zoologist
- I got 2 compliments when I wore this sample and only sprayed one spritz on my arm, so apparently it leaves a strong scent trail!
- Rating: 7.5/10


The Cookie Party üç™
- Notes: toffee, hot cocoa, marshmallow, coconut, pecan shortbread cookies
- This one is intensely gourmand. I especially pick up on the ‚Äúpecan shortbread cookies‚Äù note, but overall it smells strongly of melted butter to me
- Rating: 4/10


English Major üìö
- Notes: library books, orris absolute, marshmallow, decalepis absolute, carrot seed, sandalwood, fallen leaves 
- This one is sweet, slightly vegetal, and autumnal. I‚Äôm moreso smelling leather than books. It‚Äôs interesting, cozy, and well suited for fall/winter, but this is a strong scent. Likely going to share a small bottle with my husband because he likes it a lot
- Reminds me of Bibliotheque from Byredo
- Rating: 6.5/10


Match Made in Heaven üçµ
- Notes: matcha, vanilla soft serve, almond, cherry blossom, waffle cone, powdered sugar, sandalwood
- This one smells exactly like a matcha latte. Creamy, slightly grassy, and powdery in the smoothest way possible. A little floral from the cherry blossom, almost smells a little lotion-y
- Rating: 8/10


Snow Moon Magic üåô
- Notes: Tahitian vanilla tincture, cookie butter, lavender chai, marshmallow, tonka, crystals 
- This smells like a toned down version of The Cookie Party where this one is more milky and soft. Something is a little funky on me and I think it‚Äôs the cookie butter ‚Äî I was expecting more of a punch from the lavender chai but the cookie butter overrides it and it smells buttery again.
- I may like Moon Magic more because people say it‚Äôs the spicier version, but I didn‚Äôt grab a sample for that
- Rating: 5/10


In Dreams and Fairytales (Blueberry version) ü´ê
- Notes: baked meringue, vanilla bean absolute, sugar, chamomile, blueberry
- Blueberry pie filling with powdered sugar dusted on top. It starts out very juicy and jammy with a burst of blueberry. The blueberry note also remains in the dry down and becomes comforting and cozy with the rest of the notes. It‚Äôs amazing and I can‚Äôt stop huffing my arm
- Rating: 10/10


Fuckery üçí
- Notes: caramelized sugar, Luxardo cherry, cinnamon, tobacco, smoke, vanilla, amber, white musk
- This one has a bunch of notes I typically don‚Äôt go for (cherry, tobacco, smoke) so this sample pick was a wild card. It overall is well blended, but those notes are still something I‚Äôm not personally interested in wearing. This one is a syrupy maraschino cherry sitting on top of an old fashioned in a cigar lounge
- Rating: 5/10


Where the Wild Things Grow (Version 1) üçì
- Notes: late spring strawberries still on the vine, vanilla cream soda, fresh green grass with morning dew, ambrette seed 
- One of those old school strawberry candies mixed with Tropical Twist Trident gum. It smells decent but it‚Äôs not the realistic strawberry I was hoping for. I‚Äôm not picking up on a ton of vine or grass. 
- Rating: 5.5/10


Falling Stars (Salted Vanilla Sweet Cream version) ‚òïÔ∏è
- Notes: black coffee, almond cream, sandalwood, natural oud, palo santo oil, tonka bean absolute, vanilla bean
- This really smells like the embodiment of an iced coffee with salted vanilla sweet cream cold foam on top. Creamy, sweet, and comforting. I feel like coffee notes have a tendency to be sour/artificial but this isn‚Äôt
- Rating: 10/10


This is Not a Love Spell ü™ª
- Notes: blueberry jam, violet, creeping ivy, lavender, star anise, vanilla
- This smells like a delicious fruity, fizzy, powdery candy. A little bit of a lipstick scent as it dries down. I must like blueberry notes because this is another winner for me
- Rating: 9/10


Overall: Sorce is now my favorite perfume house. Even the ones that I didn‚Äôt love were still pretty good! Good longevity with varied comforting and interesting scents, cute bottles, and they offer windows to continue buying a perfume even if it becomes discontinued from the main collection. If you like sweet scents and gourmands, a lot of the samples are a safe bet (at least the ones I tried).

Now I‚Äôm just trying to resist ordering 5+ full size bottles at once, but these were so good üòÖ",16,1753202982.0,Indiemakeupandmore,6,1.0,False

I moved from the USA to the Netherlands last summer. I put everything in storage because I was not sure if it was a temporary move or a pernament one. It's looking to be at least longer than a year, and to be frank, I miss my garbage.

I don't have a lot of things, far fewer than most people who make the move. But it would probably still need to be via international move and I'm curious to get an idea of how much it may cost.

Please do not tell me not to move my stuff. I've been here for a year already so unlike most people, I actually know what i need and to be frank, I miss *my* garbage. Some things are just not replaceable.

Please let me know about how much you had and where you went. Everything I owned about fit in a 15ft U-Haul truck (10x10x8 storage unit), but only a fraction of that would be moved.

When we returned to our hotel I started to feel really off, my stomach started to have extremely intense pains to the point where I was like doubled over. My fianc√© insisted on taking me to the ER. Well once there not only was I in pain but let‚Äôs just say my digestive system was exploding. I was running a low fever, sweating and shaking. Not a pretty scene. They were trying to figure out if I had food poisoning or was having some sort of reaction to something I consumed. I had only had fruit and tea at my soon to be in-law‚Äôs. 


Fianc√© called his mother to ask what type of tea I was given because it tasted sort of licorice like so maybe it was a variety I couldn‚Äôt handle? Well turns out she ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù gave me a laxative tea. Yup. I was the only one who didn‚Äôt have coffee. My fianc√© freaked out on her. Eventually we went back to the hotel, he refused to go to the anniversary party and stayed with me. (Which by the way is super embarrassing) We ended up flying home the next day without seeing his parents again. His dad is horrified and was so apologetic on the phone with my partner. His mom is livid he skipped their party and playing me for causing an issue.


I‚Äôve now told him I do not want anything to do with his mother. I‚Äôve been more than nice and she what tries to poison me?! My parents are disgusted with her. My fianc√© ripped her a new one and now has her blocked. I don‚Äôt want her at my wedding anymore, and she is refusing to apologize! Would it be overreacting to ban her from our wedding?

I have gotta say, he is disappointed, and I as his GM am disappointed.

The alchemical foods are ok I suppose, but I am frustrated that there isnt a ""food"" tag. Its basically up to the GM to make up which is food and which is not. For example, [Alcohol](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=622) is not listed as an Alchemical Food but it is both Alchemical and food right? After all, [Iron Wine](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=3455) is an Alchemical Food. Then if Alcohol is considered an alchemical food, wouldnt drugs? How can I look my player in the eye and tell him [Bloodeye Coffee](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=623) is NOT alchemical food but [Fury Cocktail](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1917) is?

My only conclusion is anything ingested and is Alchemical is alchemical food. All Mutagens, Elixirs, and Drugs. Basically if it goes in your mouth its alchemical food.

1m6j7ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m6j7ml/how_does_mixpresso_single_serve_coffee_maker/,How does Mixpresso Single Serve Coffee Maker compare for quick brewing review?,"Mixpresso 0722589233463 Single Serve Coffee Maker falls into the realm of compact, efficient single-serve coffee machines that cater to a wide variety of caffeine enthusiasts. Being someone who loves a quick cup of coffee every morning but despises elaborate processes, I was eager to test this product. Designed for use with both K-capsules and ground coffee, it caught my attention with its flexibility. I spent weeks exploring its various features and quirks, and here‚Äôs how it fared.

**Design and Size**  
Something about this coffee maker‚Äôs minimalist design immediately appealed to me. Compact and sleek, it easily fit into the corner of my crowded kitchen counter without intruding upon much-needed space. With dimensions of just 10.4 inches in height, 4.5 inches wide, and 6.6 inches long, it reminded me of how travelers value lightweight gadgets. Its matte black finish is not just aesthetically pleasing but also fingerprints smudge-free‚Äîa considerable relief for someone as fussy about kitchen cleanliness as I am. If you're short on counter space or need something to toss in a bag for trips, this machine's portability could win you over. 

**Key Benefits**  
- The product is highly compact, perfect for small kitchens and travel.  
- It uses both K-capsules and ground coffee, providing brewing flexibility.  
- Matte finish ensures ease of cleaning and maintains its sleek appearance.  

[Check Mixpresso 0722589233463 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b01e3x4ok6/)

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
The brewing process is both straightforward and quick. Equipped with a powerful 1000W motor, this coffee maker can transform water into a steaming cup of coffee within just 2-3 minutes. Its one-touch button simplifies operations‚Äîyou pour water into the removable tank, add your coffee of choice (capsule or ground), and press a button. I tried both methods extensively. K-capsules are great for mornings when I‚Äôm rushing for work, while ground coffee allows experimentation with flavor profiles during weekend brunches. The speed and versatility kept me coming back. However, I noticed that the quick brewing method sometimes produced coffee that wasn‚Äôt as piping hot as I prefer. A minor hiccup for me, but others might not even notice.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Coffee may not remain as hot for extended periods.  
- The water tank could benefit from a slightly larger capacity.  

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Admittedly, I dread cleaning coffee makers‚Äîwho doesn‚Äôt? But the removable drip tray and reusable ground coffee filter on this model made my life easier. The tray caught any accidental spills, and getting it back into place took just seconds. The filter is environmentally friendly and rinses effortlessly, saving on disposable filters that you find with many competitors. It‚Äôs a small but excellent touch for those conscious of sustainability.  

**User-Friendliness and Practical Features**  
The coffee maker's design screams user-centricity. Even my less tech-savvy relatives could operate it without fumbling. Its small size not only makes it convenient to store but also accommodates travel mugs up to 4.5 inches tall. This was especially handy for long commutes, as I could brew directly into my travel cup. Automatic power-off after brewing provides extra safety‚Äîsomething crucial for forgetful individuals like me who tend to run out of the house in a hurry. 

**Product Rivals**  
Looking at alternative products, the Keurig K-Mini stands out as a strong competitor. The Keurig, like Mixpresso, is compact and supports single-serve brewing. However, I found that the Mixpresso coffee maker offered more versatility with its option to brew ground coffee, while the Keurig generally relies on K-cups. On the downside, Keurig machines sometimes feel sturdier in comparison. Additionally, Nespresso‚Äôs compact models compete in terms of aesthetics but typically cater solely to pods. If you prioritize dual options for brewing, the Mixpresso gives you a definite edge.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Let‚Äôs talk about value. Compared to some high-end single-serve coffee makers that restrict you to expensive capsules, the Mixpresso keeps operating costs low with its reusable coffee filters. It strikes a sweet balance between function, design, and affordability. While it may lack some high-end features like smart connectivity or fancier brew settings, most casual users won‚Äôt miss those extras. You‚Äôre getting reliability and speed at a fair cost, making it an appealing option for budget-conscious buyers who demand quality.

1m6j6wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m6j6wi/the_man_in_the_yellow_hat/,The Man in the Yellow Hat,"The lighthouse and the attached cottage weren‚Äôt huge, but the room Tad chose as his office was good enough. It could hold his desk and his recording equipment as well as an armchair and a small bookshelf. The best part was the window, a wide panel window looking out over the picturesque Maine harbor. Tad pulled a soda from his little fridge and sat down by his computer to work.¬†

‚ÄúHey, what are you doing?‚Äù asked Mina, his wife as she poked her head through the door. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be working?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting started,‚Äù Tad said as he loaded his programs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to record the next story.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I mean the real job,‚Äù Mina said. She pulled her hair back from her face, putting it into a tight bun. ‚ÄúThe one that lets us stay in this house.‚Äù

Tad leaned back in his chair. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? I have to keep the light running, that‚Äôs about it.‚Äù

Mina frowned. ‚ÄúYou have to keep the place looking nice too. You‚Äôre the lighthouse keeper. Have you seen the gardens, they‚Äôre a mess.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey said they have their own landscapers,‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Buckner said they didn‚Äôt like the last lighthouse keeper because he didn‚Äôt do much upkeep,‚Äù said Mina, crossing her arms. ‚ÄúYou made me sell our house to move here; I don‚Äôt want to lose this place too. You know that.‚Äù

Tad winced. ‚ÄúMina‚Ä¶ I thought you always wanted to move up here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted to move somewhere that I owned,‚Äù she retorted. ‚ÄúNot some place that some random person you work for can decide to take away from us.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is work to own,‚Äù Tad said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the last non-government owned lighthouse in the state, even if they support it. You saw the agreement, ten years working and living here and it‚Äôs ours.‚Äù

His wife turned away and began to stalk back upstairs. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs ten years for the guy to change his mind.‚Äù

Tad started to turn back to his computer, then stopped. ‚ÄúHey, Mina? Who‚Äôs Mr. Buckner?‚Äù

Mina stopped on the stairs, just out of sight. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the guy who‚Äôs always fishing down on the pier. I met him when I was down there taking pictures this morning. I told you this already.‚Äù

Her footsteps continued up the stairs to the main floor and Tad sighed.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt tell me anything anymore, you just expect me to know.‚Äù He stared at the screen for a long moment, then growled to himself and grabbed his jacket before heading out the door.

He made a slow circuit of the cottage and the lighthouse. There were a handful of raised garden beds around the front and back porches and some overgrown hydrangeas and blueberry bushes around the rest of the area. Like most of Maine‚Äôs mid coast, the ground was rocky and in between boulders the sparse grass was straggly and uneven. The screen door on the front porch banged open and shut and Mina came outside, watching as he tested the rocks that made up the borders of the raised garden beds.¬†

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt looks so bad.‚Äù

Tad looked around and scratched his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just an old garden bed filled with shrubs. I don‚Äôt really know what we can do with it. Maybe my dad could help me prune them I guess.‚Äù

Mina shook her head. ‚ÄúFine, just do something about the grass.‚Äù She shrugged into a jacket and started off down the driveway. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going for a walk. Maybe I can actually get some good pictures now that the light is okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Tad said, flashing the three fingers that was their secret code. I Love You. ‚ÄúSee you later.

Mina hesitated, then nodded, walking away without a response.¬†

‚ÄúOuch,‚Äù Tad said, wincing.

He and Mina had been having trouble for years. It had started mild and might have stayed mild if Tad hadn‚Äôt been working for a conference center. Ownership of the center had shifted, and the new proprietor had decided to unceremoniously fire all of the current employees. For Tad, it had been a forced return to his hometown, with his metaphorical tail between his legs. For Mina it had felt like a disaster, and vindication for her worries. They bought a house, something that Tad expected to sooth his wife‚Äôs worst fears, but those fears only compounded. As long as they owed the bank for the mortgage, she was sure that they would lose another home. For a little while, Tad bounced from job to job, then he finally landed something that he connected with, working as a clerk for the county library.¬†

Then, the economy crashed and inflation went through the roof. Mina, who had never been confident in their finances, began to exist in a state of nearly perpetual panic.¬†

It had been a miracle when Tad finally landed a successful podcast, writing, producing, and reading the stories himself. The podcast was more successful than he had ever expected, and Mina even agreed to move to a new home in Maine, the state that they had wanted to move to from the beginning. Almost as soon as they moved, however, the excitement and novelty had worn off, and her old fears returned. Even though they were finally financially stable, Tad could not allay Mina‚Äôs fears.¬†

‚ÄúDamned if I do, damned if I don‚Äôt,‚Äù he muttered as he dug through the garage. After a few minutes of fruitless searching he stopped, leaning his head against the open door jamb.¬†

‚ÄúI swear we packed the string trimmer,‚Äù he muttered to himself. ‚ÄúI swear we packed it‚Ä¶ where the hell is it?‚Äù He closed his eyes and sighed, swearing softly under his breath. Mina would be furious if he bought a new string trimmer without asking. Unfortunately, she would also be furious if he didn‚Äôt bother to trim the weeds. Finally, he steeled himself and hopped in the car, driving the short distance across town to the local Walmart.

Mina still wasn‚Äôt home by the time he returned, but he found an old man in an old-fashioned yellow rain hat and slicker. The old man was seated on one of the big boulders near the edge of the road, staring up at the light high overhead. He stirred as Tad parked the car and got out.

‚ÄúYou must be the new keeper,‚Äù he said, his voice deeper and stronger than his frail form suggested. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to finally meet you. My name is Hass Buckner.‚Äù

He held out a gnarled, weather-beaten hand. His eyes were bright, and his tone was friendly, but something about the man made Tad‚Äôs skin prickle uneasily.¬†

‚ÄúUh, hey,‚Äù he said slowly, shaking Buckner‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Tad, and yeah, I‚Äôm the new keeper. Is there something I can help you with Mr., er, Buckner, was it?‚Äù

Buckner turned back to gaze up at the light. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm just an old fisherman admiring the view. I don‚Äôt envy you your job though‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a big responsibility, manning this light.‚Äù

The sun, which had been so bright moments ago, dimmed and Tad looked up to see low clouds scudding across the sky.¬†

‚ÄúThe fog gets thick around these parts,‚Äù Buckner said. ‚ÄúPeople need the light and the horn.‚Äù His bright eyes turned back to Tad and Tad suddenly wondered what color they were. Yellow? Pale green?¬†

Mist rose in a billowing wall from the ocean below, carried by a chilly breeze and Bucker raised a hand, walking off down the hill. ‚ÄúGood luck Tad. It‚Äôs a big job you‚Äôve chosen.‚Äù

Somewhere high overhead the foghorn blared, set off by the automatic sensors. The sudden noise made Tad jump, and he shivered again as the fog closed in. Within minutes the damp turned into rain and he found himself sitting in the garage next to the unused string trimmer. His cell phone chimed, and he glanced at the screen. Mina was in the coffee shop, waiting out the rain. Don‚Äôt bother coming to get her, she would walk home on her own once the rain was finished.¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Tad muttered dourly as he decided to brave the rain and head inside. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to get in trouble for that later.‚Äù

He went into the lighthouse control room, checking the monitors before venturing down to his little workroom. By the time he heard the front door open and shut, he was nearly done with the new episode. He glanced at the clock, realizing that it had been hours and that his stomach was loudly protesting. Unease prickled his heart as he reached for his phone.

No calls, no texts.¬†

He sighed, relieved. Safe for the moment.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said as he went down the short hall from his studio to the kitchen. ‚ÄúHow did it go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got rained on,‚Äù Mina said. ‚ÄúWhat did you expect.‚Äù She filled a glass from the tap in the sink and sipped, staring out the window at the gloom. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you buy another string trimmer? We already have one.‚Äù

Tad tensed, but kept his face neutral. ‚ÄúSorry. I guess we left the old one at my grandparents‚Äô house by accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought we said we‚Äôd talk about big purchases before we made them. This was a big purchase.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wanted me to do the lawn,‚Äù he said carefully. ‚ÄúSo I thought‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm done talking about this,‚Äù Mina said suddenly. She turned and left the room. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to start another fight. You can make dinner for yourself. I don‚Äôt want anything.‚Äù

Tad held back a sigh. If he said anything, anything at all, it would be a fight.¬†

‚ÄúAnd no smoking in the house,‚Äù she added, turning to face him one last time. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs medicinal or whatever, don‚Äôt smoke it in my house.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going to.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sure. I can smell it when you do.‚Äù

Tad could feel his pulse begin to race, feel the anxious fire rising in his brain again. He still wasn‚Äôt sure what the sensation was, but his doctor thought it was stress-induced panic attacks. Hands shaking, Tad went out to the screened in porch that ran along the house before wrapping around the bottom of the lighthouse tower.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt smoke inside,‚Äù he muttered to himself, unlocking the small strong box he had stored in an old metal cabinet. ‚ÄúI never have smoked inside. I wouldn‚Äôt smoke at all if I didn‚Äôt have to.‚Äù

He hated that it was the only thing that helped calm his spinning mind. He had always been remarkably strait laced, even in what amounted to his teenage rebellious years. Before things went bad, Mina would joke with their friends that they could count his vices on one hand. He didn‚Äôt drink, he didn‚Äôt smoke, he didn‚Äôt do drugs. More recently, Mina made it clear that his proper demeanor meant he thought he was better than everyone around him. He didn‚Äôt. In most ways he felt as if he was broken, little more than a broken toy.¬†

As far as he could tell, the medicinal weed didn‚Äôt even make him high. It just made the world stop spinning, if only for a moment.¬†¬†

A shadow moved down on the beach and Tad sat up, smoke trailing up from his nose. A figure in yellow glided from shadow to shadow along the waters. More shadows followed and Tad frowned. There was a narrow walk from the lighthouse down to the beach and he was careful to stay quiet, stepping cautiously on the weathered wood. Almost halfway down, he swore to himself, realizing that he still had the joint clenched between his teeth. The smell of the smoke was mild compared to the smell of the harbor and the salt air, but it was recognizable, so he snubbed it out on the rock wall. He also took several deep, cleansing breaths, even though he didn‚Äôt know if it would matter. Fog was rising rapidly from the harbor; by the time he reached the pebbles and sand it was up to his waist.¬†

He moved carefully, trying to keep his footsteps silent, as he searched the deserted strip of beach. Far overhead the foghorn began to sound, making him jump in the seaside quiet.¬†

‚ÄúWhere the hell did they go?‚Äù he asked under his breath as he searched the sand for signs of passage. There were plenty of tracks between the high-water mark and the rocks, but it didn‚Äôt mean much. This place was swarmed by the town‚Äôs kids and tourists every warm afternoon, and, before the rain at least, today had been no different.¬†

He glanced back toward the inner harbor and saw a dark shape standing at the end of the nearest pier. Even in the dark he thought he could see the glimmer of yellow.

Buckner spoke without turning around, his attention focused on the fishing pole and the line that ran out into the dark water.¬†

‚ÄúWhat brings you out here in the dark Keeper?‚Äù

Tad hesitated. He wasn‚Äôt sure and part of his mind felt like he was in a dream.¬†

‚ÄúI thought I saw some people down here,‚Äù he said lamely after a moment. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ just wanted to make sure everything‚Äôs alright.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo one down here but me,‚Äù said Buckner, twitching his line. ‚ÄúBut the fog makes you see odd things sometimes. You‚Äôll get used to it‚Ä¶ or you won‚Äôt.‚Äù

Tad‚Äôs eyes went to the fog. It was all over now, obscuring almost everything but the light on the hill. He didn‚Äôt say anything. He didn‚Äôt know what to say. Actually, he wanted to leave, but couldn‚Äôt seem to make his legs respond.¬†

Buckner turned to look at him for the first time, his weird, pale eyes bright, even if the gloom. ‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ the green goddess hmm? I wouldn‚Äôt have guessed you would indulge, given your work on the light.‚Äù

‚ÄúMedicinal,‚Äù Tad said, prickling slightly inside. ‚ÄúAnxiety. It‚Äôs the only thing that seems to help.‚Äù

‚ÄúInteresting,‚Äù Buckner said, skillfully playing his line, even without looking.¬†

‚ÄúI already checked,‚Äù Tad said, scowling. ‚ÄúThey know I use it medicinally, and it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

The old man in the yellow slicker and rain hat shrugged. ‚ÄúTo each his own I suppose. Fog‚Äôs in though‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll want to be able to trust your eyes.‚Äù He glanced back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want to see any more phantoms in the mist, do you?‚Äù

The fog swirled and Tad‚Äôs mind swirled with it. Before he even knew it, he was walking back up the narrow stairs back to his lighthouse. Somewhere below him in the fog, he could hear Buckner humming. It was an eerie, baffling tune that made Tad shiver.

It was still early, but Mina was already in bed. Tad quietly showered and went to join her. Her eyes snapped open as he went to lay down.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt snore,‚Äù she growled, before rolling over. He stopped, frozen, halfway into bed. He knew from experience that even heavy breathing was considered snoring. And he did actually snore too and could expect sharp jabs in his side or back whenever he did actually fall asleep. Finally, he sighed as softly as he could and got up. He could sleep in his chair and hope that Mina could sleep. Hopefully, a good night‚Äôs sleep would mean a better day tomorrow.¬†

¬†

\*¬† \*¬† \*

¬†

Tad was up at dawn, despite the poor night‚Äôs rest on his old armchair. It was a pleasant routine, even when he was tired. The automation was easy to understand, and he mostly had to check the readouts. There was a number he could call if he needed to, but he had been informed that the chances of needing the number were essentially nil. Beyond this, it was essentially a matter of making sure the fog horns were clear and using gentle cleaners on the windows of the light and the lens itself. The fog was still in, but it was clearing and standing at the top of the lighthouse tower, Tad could see for miles over the ocean and forests. Only the lighthouse itself and some of the taller hillsides were above the cloud bank, looking like islands in an empty gray sea.

Seabirds filled the air, and he could hear the wash of waves on the rocks below. Like most mornings, Tad could almost feel at peace. Eventually, as always, hunger drove him back indoors.¬†

Before his podcast, he didn‚Äôt bother with breakfast. Now, breakfast and a light dinner were usually all he ate. He had made a plate of eggs and bacon and was working on building a small tower of waffles when Mina came in. The fog was completely gone now and as she walked through the beams of early morning sunlight, he thought she looked beautiful. He smiled as she sat down, looking at the food he‚Äôd set out.¬†

¬†‚ÄúDid we really need to buy most of this?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúWe should just stick to cereal if you really want to eat breakfast.‚Äù

Tad‚Äôs spirits fell. ‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd like breakfast today.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll just have some coffee,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you come to bed last night?‚Äù

‚ÄúI did,‚Äù he said carefully. ‚ÄúYou said you were worried that I‚Äôd snore and keep you up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember you even coming in.‚Äù She got up and walked away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll drink my coffee on the porch. Do you mind making it for me?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt wait for a reply.¬†

He wasn‚Äôt quick enough either. As he was trying to finish the last batch of waffles and eggs, she came back in and took a cup, not even offering him a glance as she turned on the coffee maker. The next thing he knew, she was gone again and he was eating alone at the table she‚Äôd picked out for the dining room/kitchen of the cozy cottage.¬†

Afterwards, Mina left to walk the harbor. She was hoping to get a job as a photographer for one of the boat tours, but as the tourist season was drawing to a close, Tad didn‚Äôt have much hope. He didn‚Äôt think she had to work, really, he hoped that she would try to start her own photography studio as she had always wanted. Instead, she was insistent upon traditional employment, absolutely determined to make her way without any loans. She couldn‚Äôt stand the thought of owing anyone money, even if it was a business loan.¬†

While she was gone, Tad tried to work. He finished the last of the editing for the new episode and he began to record one of the finished stories. He knew he should write another story before he went much further, but the morning had unsettled and discouraged him. Eventually, he turned off the recorder and the computer and stared out at the endless water of the North Atlantic. The fog, having withdrawn out beyond the islands in the distance, began to return, almost as if it sensed his gaze and meant to obscure it. He frowned, wondering if it had always been like this. He‚Äôd spent weeks each summer at a small town down the coast and he knew it could be foggy for days, but he didn‚Äôt remember this.¬†

Tad decided to walk down to the harbor. Maybe he could find Mina. They could turn the day into a date, something she‚Äôd been asking for. He walked quickly down to the waterfront, only to stop. Mina was there at the docks, talking to Buckner and a handful of other assorted fishermen and workers. They dispersed as I walked down the pier, with Buckner and one of the other fishermen climbing into a boat and puttering off into the fog.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù he asked as the other workers and fishermen began to drift away.¬†

‚ÄúWe should start going to church again,‚Äù Mina said, her eyes distant as she stared out into the fog.¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said, confused. ‚ÄúWe can keep trying to find a church. I heard good things about‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWe should go to Buckner‚Äôs,‚Äù she said, slipping her hands into her pockets and hunching her shoulders against the rising breeze. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a pastor you know? There‚Äôs a ferry that goes out to the island on Sunday evenings.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù he said slowly. ‚ÄúUnusual time, but cool, I guess. What does he teach?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe truth,‚Äù Mina said, her tone indicating that her husband had asked a dumb question. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs amazing to hear him talk‚Ä¶‚Äù

Tad glanced towards where the boat had vanished into the fog. ‚ÄúWhat was he talking about?‚Äù

Mina scowled at him. ‚ÄúIf you want to know, you should show up. You never do anything with me anymore.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you wanted me to come with you today,‚Äù Tad said, turning slightly to face the water instead of her gaze. ‚ÄúHow was‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just supposed to know, okay?‚Äù she snapped, stalking away. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your job. See you later.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù Tad raised his hands helplessly, but she was already gone, heading back up the hill to the lighthouse.

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù he grumbled. He began to follow her, but stopped, then turned away and went in the other direction. He wandered aimlessly for a while, then found himself standing in front of the town‚Äôs Catholic church. Tad wasn‚Äôt Catholic, he wasn‚Äôt sure if he was even a protestant anymore, but something compelled him inside.

‚ÄúOh, hello,‚Äù said a man dressed as a priest. He was short and heavyset, busily cleaning the entry to the nave. ‚ÄúIf you are here for confession, I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôre here a little early.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶‚Äù Tad paused and shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not actually catholic. I just wanted to come in here and pray I guess.‚Äù

The priest nodded, then paused, looking at Tad for a moment. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the new lighthouse keeper, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Tad said, extending his hand. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúSmall town,‚Äù he said with an easy smile. ‚ÄúYou know how it is.‚Äù He paused and cocked his head. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre okay? You look like you need to sit down.‚Äù¬†

The words made Tad realize that his head was spinning and that his knees were weak. He nodded slowly and half staggered to the rear most pew.

‚ÄúMy wife,‚Äù he began, then stopping to wonder what could even be said. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs been talking to an old fisherman‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOld Buckner?‚Äù the priest said. He sighed and looked away. ‚ÄúI guess he got another one.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Tad asked, feeling a sudden pang of worry. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean he got another one?‚Äù

The priest looked at him for a long moment. ‚ÄúMr. Buckner, or I guess I should say, pastor Buckner, has been around a long time, longer than me, that‚Äôs for sure. He has a church of sorts out on the islands‚Ä¶‚Äù The man trailed off. ‚ÄúWell, I guess it‚Äôs a church. Doesn‚Äôt look like a church to me, but still. Half of my congregation has moved out there and more than a couple of families split up because of it. Husbands or wives becoming devoted to it and leaving the family behind.‚Äù

Tad groaned and hung his head in his hands. A gentle hand roused him and he found the Priest looking at him with kind, understanding eyes.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give up,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA few of the people came to their senses. God willing, your wife will be one of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that lucky,‚Äù Tad said hoarsely. ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶ er, sorry, heck does he teach anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had the pleasure of hearing his sermons,‚Äù the priest said dryly. ‚ÄúBut Hell might actually be the correct term. Splitting families, driving fears and selfish acts‚Ä¶ not exactly godly I‚Äôd say.‚Äù He stopped and rubbed his chin thoughtfully. ‚ÄúThe few people I‚Äôve managed to talk to all asked me the same question.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

The priest smiled, a sad, wan thing. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you make me feel like he makes me feel?‚Äù

After years of dealing with scratches, stains, and occasional accidents, I've finally figured out which materials actually stand up to daily pet wear and tear.

Solid wood remains my top choice for pet-friendly coffee tables. It's naturally durable, easy to clean, and can be refinished if needed. Oak and maple are particularly resistant to scratches from cat claws or dog paws. Plus, if your pet happens to have an accident, wood won't absorb odors like some other materials might.

Metal coffee tables, especially those made from stainless steel or wrought iron, are another excellent option. They're practically indestructible and super easy to wipe clean. I recently found some gorgeous metal and wood combinations (you can check them out here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables) that offer both style and practicality.

Avoid glass tables at all costs if you have pets. They show every nose print, paw mark, and water splash. Plus, they can be dangerous if knocked over by an excited dog. Similarly, particle board furniture tends to fall apart quickly when exposed to water or pet accidents.

Some practical tips I've learned:
- Choose tables with rounded corners to prevent injuries during playful moments
- Look for water-resistant finishes
- Consider height ‚Äì lower tables are more stable and less likely to tip
- Dark finishes hide fur better than light ones

If you're in the market for a new coffee table, I've found some great pet-friendly options that combine style with practicality. You can browse through my recommended collection here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. I personally lean toward the solid wood pieces with protective finishes.

Remember, whatever material you choose, make sure it's something you can easily clean and maintain. I've found that the best pet-friendly furniture is the kind you don't have to stress about constantly protecting. Your home should be comfortable for both you and your pets.

For maintenance, I suggest keeping a microfiber cloth handy for quick wipes and using pet-friendly cleaning products. This way, you can enjoy your coffee table while your pets can be their natural selves without causing lasting damage.",1,1753202360.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1m6izut,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmyLynnBradley/comments/1m6izut/why_has_the_bradley_family_focused_solely_on/,"Why Has the Bradley Family Focused Solely on Trafficking? Ignoring Amy‚Äôs Mental State, Sexuality, and Other Plausible Theories","After reading the full dismissal order from the family‚Äôs 1999 lawsuit against Royal Caribbean, I‚Äôm deeply concerned by how narrow and curated the public narrative has become‚Äîand how little room has been made for the full truth about Amy‚Äôs state of mind, identity, or possible fate.

Let‚Äôs start with the facts that often get left out:



1. The 1999 Lawsuits Were Dismissed for ‚ÄúFraud on the Court‚Äù
Amy‚Äôs family filed two lawsuits against Royal Caribbean in 1999, claiming she had been abducted and trafficked from the ship. But in 2000, the court dismissed both cases with prejudice after finding the family had deliberately withheld over 100 reported sightings‚Äîonly sharing the ones that supported their trafficking theory. This is known legally as fraud on the court.

‚ÄúThe Bradleys were attempting to misdirect the Court and the Defendant‚Ä¶ The evidence shows that the Bradleys were attempting to mislead the judicial system.‚Äù ‚Äî official court filing

The court ruled they had manipulated the record by only presenting selected witnesses (who allegedly saw Amy in distress), while omitting others who described her alive, unbothered, and unaccompanied on the beach. They were ordered to pay Royal Caribbean‚Äôs legal fees.

Court source discussion here (Websleuths, with full screenshots and legal summary):
https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/va-amy-bradley-23-petersburg-24-march-1998-3.187717/page-51



2. The Family Never Funded or Initiated a Dive or Body Recovery Mission
Despite Amy going missing at sea, the family never organized underwater searches. This is in sharp contrast to cases like Natalee Holloway‚Äôs, where the family hired professional dive teams, dogs, sonar, radar, and recovery crews‚Äîeven while chasing false sightings.



3. The Narrative Has Ignored Amy‚Äôs Emotional and Mental Health State
There has been no public exploration by the family of Amy‚Äôs mental health or emotional condition. No serious discussion about:
	‚Ä¢	The fact that Amy had been feeling unwell before her disappearance
	‚Ä¢	That she was under emotional strain, having just ended a two-year relationship with Kat that her father reportedly disapproved of
	‚Ä¢	That she was in the middle of a rocky, emotionally charged dynamic with her new girlfriend, Mollie, who she had written to just 30 days prior in a deeply sad and isolated letter
	‚Ä¢	That she supposedly left the room with no shoes, no wallet, no key card, in the early morning after drinking heavily
	‚Ä¢	That there was no way to arrange a meeting without phones, texts, or alarms‚Äîhow would she have coordinated anything after being in the room drunk for almost 2 hours?

None of this has ever been addressed as a possible factor. The family has instead centered one singular theory‚Äîtrafficking‚Äîand dismissed or ignored every other explanation, from falling overboard to suicide to voluntary disappearance.



4. The Alcohol Intake Was Significant, and Rarely Discussed Honestly
Amy had seven drinks billed to the room, and was also seen holding other drinks, possibly purchased by others. On Reddit, full clips show her clearly intoxicated‚Äîmuch more so than the edited versions shown in the Netflix series. It‚Äôs a key detail that undermines the theory of her planning a secret meetup or being perfectly aware of her surroundings.



5. The Erasure of Her Queerness is Deeply Disturbing
Amy was a lesbian. She had a serious two-year relationship with Kat and was trying to repair things with Mollie. Her queerness is not incidental‚Äîit‚Äôs central to her emotional reality. And yet:
	‚Ä¢	Her father reportedly wrote Kat a multi-page letter condemning their relationship and telling her to stay away
	‚Ä¢	The Netflix doc barely touches this, and the family avoids it entirely in public interviews

https://substack.com/inbox/post/168755958?r=1wufn9&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR509DAt5FWuVwkihu4ykxrbx5zNdYYQgJasKRoqbtaLPFvWD6OvmSjnQbXlaQ_aem_XETsPMhst1U3bUjYV-n0sQ&triedRedirect=true

	‚Ä¢	Online discourse‚Äîespecially on Facebook and TikTok‚Äîhas latched onto a recent claim by Amy‚Äôs brother that she had a boyfriend, something never previously mentioned in any version of the case
	‚Ä¢	This sudden addition to the narrative feels like an attempt to ‚Äústraight-wash‚Äù her life and invalidate the possibility that she was depressed about her romantic life

We see this behavior a lot in conservative families‚Äînot full disownment, but a quiet invalidation of same-sex relationships, treating them as less serious or not ‚Äúreal.‚Äù That dynamic matters. It informs how supported Amy felt, and what might have been weighing on her.



6. Sightings and Public Sensationalism Mirror Natalee Holloway‚Äôs Case‚ÄîBut With a Very Different Outcome
Natalee Holloway‚Äôs case saw dozens of global sightings, many of them unreliable. Her family still launched parallel efforts to search the sea, the island, and follow up on tips. In the end, her body was found years later, and it was confirmed that she died the night she disappeared.

Yet with Amy, every time someone suggests she may have died that night or left voluntarily, it‚Äôs dismissed as offensive‚Äîwhile the family clings only to the idea that she was trafficked and is still alive.



7. This Isn‚Äôt About Disrespect. It‚Äôs About Honesty.
Amy may have been trafficked. But she may also have:
	‚Ä¢	Fallen overboard
	‚Ä¢	Died by suicide
	‚Ä¢	Run away in distress
	‚Ä¢	Slipped while intoxicated
	‚Ä¢	Had a mental health crisis
	‚Ä¢	Been rejected emotionally and felt isolated

All of these theories deserve equal consideration. But the court case proves the family has actively ignored, hidden, or erased any evidence that didn‚Äôt support their preferred version of events.

And now that the Netflix documentary has gone viral, a new generation of people is falling into the same trap: treating Amy as a flat ‚Äúperfect victim,‚Äù while ignoring her full humanity.

She was queer. She was in love. She was grieving. She was drinking. She was stressed. And she disappeared. We owe her the full truth‚Äînot just the narrative that‚Äôs easiest to digest.



8. The sudden ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù claim conveniently erases the emotional reality of her final days.
For over two decades, no one‚Äînot one single person‚Äîhas ever mentioned Amy having a boyfriend. Not in the media, not in forums, not in the countless interviews her family did with Dr. Phil, Dateline, or Unsolved Mysteries. Not even in the original court case, where the family laid out what they claimed were the last known facts of her life. This ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù only appeared after the Netflix documentary aired and included interviews with her ex-girlfriends.

But the facts remain: Amy had recently ended a two-year relationship with Kat, a woman her father openly disapproved of. She had just started a new, emotionally rocky relationship with another woman, Molly, who received a distressed letter from Amy exactly 30 days before the cruise. Both women have been verified through photos, letters, and firsthand accounts. Kat even wrote publicly about Amy but stayed silent out of respect for the family‚Äôs discomfort with her sexuality. These were not casual flings‚Äîthese were formative relationships.

By suddenly inserting the idea of a male partner into the story, the family changes the entire emotional framing. If she had a boyfriend, then maybe she was moving on. Maybe she wasn‚Äôt heartbroken or overwhelmed. Maybe she wasn‚Äôt distressed at all. But there‚Äôs no evidence to support that. The timing of this new detail conveniently diverts attention away from deeper truths‚Äîabout her mental state, her identity, and the possibility that she might have left the ship on her own, accidentally fallen, or even taken her own life.

The boyfriend claim functions not just as erasure‚Äîit‚Äôs a narrative tool. It downplays Amy‚Äôs queerness, dismisses the emotional weight of her breakup, and reinforces the family‚Äôs preferred theory: that she was abducted, that she‚Äôs alive, and that there‚Äôs no other possibility worth considering. But we owe Amy more than a tidy story. We owe her the truth‚Äîeven the uncomfortable parts.

Then

The weekend breaks like morning sun,
With scattered socks and half-eaten crumbs.
Little feet pound down the hall,
A fortress built, a sudden fall.

The house becomes a breathing thing,
Alive with cries and songs they sing.
Noise, but not the kind that grates
The kind the heart anticipates.

Toy-strewn floors and cuddles tight,
Bath-time battles, dreams at night.
A different calm‚Äîjust less refined,
But softer somehow, in the mind.

We had to take him to the vet yesterday due to him throwing up black stuff that had the texture of coffee grounds and figured that it was blood after looking into it online. When when we got to the vet they took a x-ray and had notified us that he has a large Mass located right near his stomach. With him being older certain routes are out of the questions such as chemo and surgery since his body wouldn't be able to handle it.  
  
After hearing the news my girlfriend is the distraught and heartbroken as she has had him since she was a kid and has been trying to do as much research as possible. I figured it'd be worth trying to post on here to get advice from professionals or anybody that knows what they're talking about or has been through it personally. We just want him to be comfortable and if possible put them on a regimen that could possibly help cure or better his situation even if it's a tiny bit.  
  
there are a few medications / supplements that she keeps coming across and is trying to see if anybody else has used it or knows anything about it. I will also be including a drop of box link to a photo I took of the X-ray. If anybody is able to read it and tell us what they see we would be extremely grateful. We will be calling the vet soon to ask if there's any medications that they could prescribe to help with some of the symptoms he has. We are trying to help increase his appetite and just calm him as he has been hiding under her brother's bed since all this has been going on and hasn't been eating much.

In other western countries coffee is often sold for very similar prices as it is in India, which just doesn't make sense to me, as often times those countries import their coffee while our coffee is grown and roasted locally

does anyone have any idea why its like this, is it just blatant overcharging or are there genuine reasons?

My brother got me this briefcase while in Italy and I was wondering if there is anything I should be doing to protect the leather. I‚Äôm an attorney in NYC, so it is inevitable that it‚Äôll get rained on, snowed on, coffee spilled on it, etc. 

I‚Äôm not sure what type of leather it is, as there are no labels on it. I believe it is crazy horse leather (based on my research), but I could be wrong. 

Are there any products I should buy to care for it? Is it similar to caring for my leather dress shoes?

I‚Äôm really into minimalist travel and camping. I love the simplicity of carrying only what I need and making every item count. I‚Äôve already dialed in my shelter and sleep setup: I use a basic 2-person tent from Lonerider, and my pad and quilt are from Sea to Summit.

I'm currently trying to optimize how I pack my clothing and essentials. I usually go by the ‚Äúranger rule‚Äù: 2 shirts, 2 pairs of underwear, 2 pairs of socks. I also carry a Sea to Summit clothesline and an Airlite towel. I‚Äôve been looking for durable packing cubes‚Äîpreferably ones with compression‚Äîbut many people seem underwhelmed by Osprey's. Any suggestions?

A big challenge for me is packing diabetic supplies. I need to carry a good amount of medication and materials that are sensitive to heat and sunlight. I‚Äôve looked at Yeti‚Äôs extra small insulated bags, which seem ideal but are quite expensive. Are there more affordable insulated options worth trying?

Also wondering how others organize their food module. I‚Äôve got a compact stove setup (MSR Pocket Rocket + 100g canister), an Italian moka pot for coffee (non-negotiable!), and I usually pack cereal bars, snacks, and emergency candy in case of low blood sugar. I‚Äôd love to keep this all in a tidy, accessible cube or pouch‚Äîright now I use ziplocks, but I know there‚Äôs probably a better system out there.

Would love to hear how you modularize and protect sensitive or messy gear. Thanks in advance for your help!

I picked up some bags of DAK that were roasted on 06/23. I've rested them for nearly a month and just opened them up yesterday when I ran out of my previous coffee. Based on the descriptions and reviews I've seen online, all 4 bags are relatively muted in taste. 

This is not my previous experience with DAK, so I'm wondering if I waited too long to try them and missed their peak flavor, or vice versa: they just need more resting time?

  
I picked up filter roast for Mango Tango, Raspberry Pop, Saint Tropez, and an espresso roast Berry Bounce. They are all great drinking coffee, but I'm expecting more flavors in the cup.

I (29, F) have a friend of 3 years (24, F) let's call her Anna. She is a bit in the spectrum but, from what I observed, it doesn't affect her day-to-day life.. she's quite goofy and quotes internet buzz words. We don't really hang out all the time; but when we do, it's usually just us going to a coffee shop we already frequent and talk about surface-level things like ""how's work"" type stuff. She has introduced me as her ""best friend"", and although I am flattered by the label, I don't really see us in that way as we don't have deeper conversations (and not for the lack of trying either, Anna is uninterested in politics.. we don't have hobbies in common.. and when I talk to her about my relationship, she's always very pessimistic) One thing to note is that Anna is from a rich family, the type of rich where she doesn't really need to work and she's traveled to different countries on her parents' dime; I am from a middle class family and although my parents were able to afford to send me to a private school, they cannot afford to provide anything else like smart phones, laptops, etc. I've been working on 2 jobs for 5 years which is why I'm able to afford the trip to SouthEast Asia that Anna and I were about to have.

When she first brought up the idea of us going on a trip together, I hesitated because I know she is very stingy-- often I would pay for our drinks expecting her to cover for next time but never does. There was also one time where she arrived at the cafe first so I asked her to order my and my bf's drink.. she asked me to wire her the money first. When we arrived, I excused myself to the restroom and I came back seeing my boyfriend hand her money. Naturally, I asked what it was for and they both said it was for the coffee. I reminded her that I had already wired her the money which Anna denied until I showed her my banking app, she then said ""Well, I haven't received anything yet"" even though she confirmed receipt in our text.

The only reason I agreed to this trip was because I have 5 online gaming friends (of 4 years) from that country.

Anna booked our accommodation and when I asked her about it during a discord call with my Vietnamese friends, Anna told me ""don't worry about it babe, I got it covered, you'll be the trip princess"". While I assumed she would pay for our hotels based on what she keeps saying, I still offered to chip in but she keeps saying ""don't worry about it"".

So fast forward to the day BEFORE our flight, we had a ""briefing"". We both live in the main city but she lives on the hills while I live a bit further. So I told her we should just book separate rides straight to the airport. Anna has a boyfriend that can drive her to the airport but she told me it would be a better idea to go together and that her boyfriend couldn't drive her all the way to the airport, only to the bus station. I wasn't a fan of the idea but I agreed anyway. Anna and her bf arrived an hour late and, not only that, she had forgotten her passport. By the time she realized, her boyfriend had already left. I was already irked from waiting for an hour, had my meals prepped (while she arrived late and still went to buy fast food), and Anna asked me to buy her toiletries when I arrived at the meeting place before she did. She couldn't call anyone to take her passport to the bus station as her bedroom was locked and she herself wasn't sure where she had left it. She didn't want to bring her 8kg. luggage with her so she left it with me (mind you, I have a 6kg. backpack and a body bag with me) her luggage wasn't a trolley but rather a duffel bag with wheels. So even tho I didn't need to carry the bag, it was still difficult to drag it around with the bags I already have (from where we met to the bus station was around 600 meters) she couldn't arrive back in time for the bus, so I had to commute all by myself with all of our bags to the airport--- which totally defeated the purpose of her plan to go together instead of my plan to just have individual rides straight to the airport.

Anyway, our flight got delayed which caused us to miss our connecting international flight. Already off to a good start! Fast-forward to us landing in Vietnam. I went to a nearby ATM and withdrew money, I asked Anna if she needed me to withdraw her pocket money but she refused and said she would just go for money exchange (we will come back to this later) She didn't end up exchanging currency as it was too low so she wanted to find her bank ATM later (she still refused my offer to have Anna wire me money and I withdraw the cash for her)

We arrived at our accommodation. To give a better perspective on our itinerary, we stayed somewhere in Hoi An. We were only planning to stay here for 2 nights to enjoy the food and beach. Later Anna told me she wanted to watch a show in Hoi An at around 8PM but we checkout at noon that day, with our next accommodation in Da Nang (around 40 mins. away) the NEXT day. I was really confused at this point because I don't understand why we have 1 day with no accommodation. I told her we can't go to that show since we would need to bring our bags with us in which she explained that we can just leave our luggage at our Hoi An accommodation even after checking out. I went to confirm this with the landlord and while we can leave our luggage, it was in the reception area with no CCTVs or guards. I was very much against this so I told her we should just extend our stay or book a hostel close to where the show will be held in which we did the latter. Before we checked out, Anna asked me to go withdraw money and pay for the accommodation as she couldn't find her bank anywhere near the area. I got a bit upset because she could've told me back at the airport and it was extremely sunny outside with the closest ATM being around 500 meters from where we were. Anna didn't say anything while I was prepping to go out (she also didn't offer to go with me).

Before we went to the show she wanted to go to, we had dinner. I took a few nice photos of Anna with my phone and I asked her to do the same (using my phone) I showed her the photos I took of her and told her I wanted exactly like that-- just a simple photo of me in the center, with the food and riverside showing. She did so much-- from leaning back to tilting my phone. I told her again she didn't need to do any of that and just take a simple straight photo. All the photos were either blurry, overexposed or with me in the middle of changing poses. I didn't understand how any of this was happening when it was so easy for me to click 1 button and take sharp photos of her (I didn't tweak any of the camera settings or anything like that) On hindsight, this part seemed shallow but after all the pent up frustrations I had, I just ended up holding back tears (which means I was quite and looked away from Anna) This was also my very first international trip and she knew how exciting this was for me. All I wanted was just a simple photo of me with the food and riverside but I can't even have that.

After a while, Anna rolled her eyes and apologized but in a sarcastic tone implying it's not something I should cry about-- as if the photo was the only thing that couldn't be done right. After paying for our meal, we left for the show. Although this was in the evening, it was still extremely hot and humid. I'm anemic and have a lung condition so nearing the end of the crowded show, I told her we had to leave or I would faint. We walked back to our hostel which was 5 mins. away and Anna kept stalling-- like stopping in the middle of the road, looking around (I don't even know what she was looking) I asked her what's wrong but she wouldn't answer me properly and I reminded her I'm not feeling well-- I was visibly angry at this point. Anna told me to go on ahead to our hostel and I rushed to do just that. We have location sharing on, she's well-traveled and I was in the middle of fighting my body from fainting so my main concern wasn't on her. And again, our hostel was 5 mins. away on foot. I arrived and I immediately drank water and rested. A few mins. later I heard several loud groans, I recognized it was Anna's so I went to check. I saw her on a long chair having a ""seizure"" and my initial thought was ""Are we serious right now"" and scoffed in shock. This may sound heartless but I immediately did not think it was real. She was stiff, convulsing, and had eyes her rolled up. The landlord and a few neighbors came in to check on us while I was holding Anna's neck for support. None of us knew what to do, I tried checking her bag for any medication or EpiPens-- she had some pills but when I showed it to Anna while she was twitching/convulsing and she said ""no..no"". There were moments of panic on my end since it could still be real (I've never seen anyone have a seizure before) While having her 'seizure' she said ""Give me sugar, give me sugar"". I immediately asked for sugar from the onlookers. The landlord mentioned she called an ambulance and Anna muttered no repeatedly while still having her seizure. One of the aunties came back with a hard candy which I fed to Anna and she slowly blinked, her eyes no long rolled back. I'm not sure how much time has passed but the landlord informed me the ambulance is close. Anna once again said no and I said ""Don't worry Anna, you will be ok"", she said she's ok while still being in her stiffened position with the occasional twitches. Anna asked help to be seated and said she's now OK. The ambulance arrived and she said she doesn't need them and that it was unnecessary. A nurse came up to her to check how she was, Anna was able to talk properly and said she's already had her sugar (the hard candy) so she's ok. The nurse still checked her blood pressure twice (using a sphygmomanometer and a pulse oximeter-- had to google what they were called) both results show her blood pressure was normal. Everyone insisted Anna still goes to the hospital to have a doctor check and Anna strongly declined. The whole discussion was happening with her standing up and shaking her head no while being on her phone. I couldn't make up what she was looking up but it looked like Reddit. Even after the landlord said it's the law to confirm with a doctor (as Anna was a foreigner having a health-related emergency) Anna still declined. After a while she eventually agreed (my suspicion is that she looked up the cost of medical assistance in Vietnam since she kept mentioning she doesn't have travel insurance) We arrived at the hospital, she was walking normally and speaking to me normally. The doctor did a glucose test on her (pricking her finger and getting blood) and the result was 5.7 which the doctor said was normal but still a bit low. Anna looked to me and said ""See, still low. I could've died"". Which frustrated me because when her blood pressure was noted as normal, she said loudly ""See? I'm fine, I don't need to go to a hospital"". Anna refused a glucose infusion and opted to get her own sugar (which she never did get btw). I can see the doctor and nurse shaking their heads as they converse in Vietnamese. I followed the nurse and Anna to the billing station, and I sat down by the waiting area. Anna then turned to me and said ""It's 850K VND"". I have her bag with me so I assumed she wanted me to hand her wallet, but she then said she doesn't have money with her. As frustrating as it was, I paid to just get this over with. After paying, she didn't say thank you or promised to pay me back-- instead, she said ""Haha time to scam my dad. I'll tell him it's 7million vnd instead of 850k"" I. Was. Baffled. Appalled. Dumbfounded. Shookt to the core-- what have you. We got back to our hostel and I told Anna I wanted to send a video to my Vietnamese friend saying she's now alright (I was texting him the entire time and asking him for advice) What did she do? She held her medical record, rapidly shook her head with her tongue out. I wish I was joking. If you were having seizures, would you be shaking your head just a few minutes later? I also want to add that she had time to walk all the way to our hostel, unstrap her high-heel shoes and place it on the shoe rack and had her ""seizure"" on a comfortable long chair instead of, I don't know, the floor maybe.

Anna was talking normally the entire time and pushing conversations as if we weren't speaking after dinner. Which led me to believe she was just doing all the theatrics in hopes it would mend our friendship. I was being careful and polite as I didn't want to trigger her or make her act out again. I was just planning to book a different hotel once we reach Ho Chi Minh (where my friends were) and go our separate ways from there-- we were supposed to go our separate ways once I go home (after our HCM stay) and she goes to Hanoi.

Our entire stay at Da Nang was me wanting to stay by the beach and her going on hikes up the mountains (I declined her invitations simply because I don't wanna be around her anymore and end up paying for snacks here and there but I was declining politely and making sure she didn't think I was just avoiding her)

Now (yes it doesn't end yet) before our flight to HCM, my friends asked for our hotel address so they can pick us up the next day. Anna had already informed me the name of the hotel but she sent me a different name address-- she explained the name was different because it's in vietnamese. My vn friends were very surprised about the hotel address and said it was horrible (this whole conversation is happening in a group chat with Anna and my Vietnamese friends) There was a lot of back-and-fourth but tldr, she was telling me different hotel names while we stayed in a much cheaper place. I never complained about our accommodation as they were clean and seemed reasonably priced. Anna has also told me some time during our stay in Hoi An about how much the hotels cost, only then telling me we split 50-50.

There's a bunch more things that happened that irritated my friends and I but I think I've made my point across. I am now back at home writing this post and I know the correct answer is to cut her off, but from her perspective, she doesn't know I know she faked her seizure, or that I know she's extorting more money from me, etc. How should I go about this? Should I just completely ghost her? I honestly don't want to confront her at all since I just know she's gonna twist the story or something.",1,1753201975.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

Steep 1 (flash) - earthy, nutty, herbal, notes of dark chocolate and coffee, baked goods

Steep 2 (flash) - cacao/coffee bean character still prevalent, I take a quick smell of the dry cake to check, but I don't notice any obvious roasted character, nice light tingle on the lips. Bitterness not really jumping out, but may be integrated into that cacao note

Steep 3 (5s) - hay note becoming more prominent up front before the cookie and cacao notes, touch of stone fruit while breathing out

Steep 4 (10s) - sweet bake shop character still in the lead note

Steep 5 (20s) - sweet and toasty notes, with orange marmalade coming in

Steep 6+ (30s+) - fortune cookies

Overall impression - This tea was included as a bonus with Bitterleaf's 2025 sheng sampler and it is certainly unique. If it wasn't for the fact that I smelled something unusual like a bakery in the wash before I even took a sip, I'd think that the muffin I had a while ago for breakfast was messing with my perceptions here.

I don't think I'd order this if it were for sale, but this calls to mind chocolate chip cookies and scones with orange marmalade or apricot preserves.

**Dear agent,**

Anna knows there are 2.4 calories in a fingernail because she‚Äôs Googled it, along with ‚Äúcalories in toothpaste‚Äù and ‚Äúhow to get permanently banned from every takeout app‚Äù. She's twenty-nine with an eating disorder that doesn‚Äôt fit the textbook definitions, and has spent years avoiding anyone who might recognize her. Anna only talks to Rachel, a voice in her head that's been her sole companion, making it easy to ignore her parents‚Äô desperate calls from the life she left behind.

Enter Cricket: a scrappy, furious little dog who adopts her. Suddenly Anna has vet appointments, dog food to buy, and small talk in the hallway. For the first time in years, she talks to real people more than she talks to Rachel.

When Cricket eats cooked bones Anna left out after a late-night binge and needs emergency surgery, she files a claim with her own company's pet insurance and watches it get denied. Digging deeper reveals systemic fraud: her employer routinely rejects legitimate claims,¬†banking on heartbroken pet owners to give up.

For once, Anna isn't running from a problem. Gathering testimonies and building a case against her company becomes the first thing that matters more than counting calories. With every story she documents, Anna is becoming the person she once was: the one who believed in justice, who thought her voice mattered. But fighting back means risking exposure that could force Anna back to her parents, her hometown, and the people who knew the person she used to be. It would strip away the privacy her eating disorder needs to function, putting her under the scrutiny of those who care about her, and she's built her entire life around avoiding exactly that.

HOW MANY CALORIES IN A FINGERNAIL is an upmarket fiction novel at 90,000 words. It will appeal to readers of Gail Honeyman's¬†*Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine*¬†and Matt Haig's¬†*The Midnight Library.*

I'm a Swedish writer living in Belgium with a small black dog who, like Cricket, changed everything. My background in insurance inspired this story's corporate elements. This is my debut novel.

**First 300 words**

It's Tuesday night, 2:47 AM, and I'm eating chocolate cereal from the box while sitting on the kitchen floor with my back against the cabinet. The linoleum is cold through my pants, and there's a coffee stain near my foot that's been there since last week or maybe the week before. Time gets slippery when you're awake at the wrong hours.

""Forty-three,"" Rachel says, though she's only in my head.

She's been counting the cereal pieces since I started. I don't know why she does this. Maybe dead people get bored. I'm doing my own counting‚Äîtwelve calories per piece. Five hundred and sixteen so far.

""Forty-four. You know bowls exist.""

""So does sleep."" Another piece. Five twenty-eight. The cereal sticks to the roof of my mouth, dry and gritty.

""Fair point."" Rachel's voice gets softer when I ignore her too long. ""What are we doing here, Anna?""

""Eating cereal.""

""Anna.""

I close the box. Open it again. The cardboard is getting soft where I keep folding it. There's chocolate dust on my fingers, under my nails. The kitchen smells like old dishwater and the vanilla candle I burned down to nothing three days ago.

""Mrs Kallio's cat is staring at you again.""

I look up. Muru, my neighbour‚Äôs fluffy white cat is pressed against the fire escape window with his yellow eyes reflecting the kitchen light.

""At least someone's keeping you company,"" Rachel says.

""You're keeping me company.""

""I'm gone, Anna. That doesn't really count.""

My pyjama pants‚Äîthe soft ones, the kind that are supposed to be kind to you‚Äîpress against my waist. I shift position but nothing changes. Fat doesn't rearrange itself to be polite. The cabinet handle drives into my shoulder blade and I don't move because this is what I deserve. I grab a handful of cereal and shove it in my mouth. Then another handful. I've stopped counting but my stupid brain hasn't figured that out yet. Twelve times... something. I don't know. I don't care.

1m6ityg,https://i.redd.it/f6cvqvvddgef1.jpeg,"Am i overreacting? my sister accused me of using ""Substances"" at work...","So I (35F) work at a design firm; my boss (38M) and I have a very trusting relationship. I have always gone above and beyond for my job. I have taken on extra responsibilities to help the company during the COVID-19 pandemic and always strive to boost morale in the office, as I genuinely care about my coworkers. 

my Sister (27F) had a job working at Whole Foods and never really felt she could do more than that, which is why I felt that she would be a good addition to the company when a position opened up for HR, so I recommended her for the position since it would be entry-level and she was hired. Fast forward a few years, and we have been working together under the same manager, but we had a few issues working together. For context, she has always felt inferior to me, always feeling less pretty, less (street) smart (she is book smart), and jealous of me having friends while she had to leave high school and do homeschooling because she was getting bullied.

I had hoped that now that we are older, she would understand that I have always been rooting for her. I try to help her to the point where she constantly demands that I stop babying her, but always comes to me to fix the trouble she gets herself into.

I am not perfect. I'm sure she wishes I could be more loving and less uptight about things. I'm not big on physical touch since I have a germs thing, and I try my best to always be upfront with everyone, even if it's not pleasant to hear. Sometimes, she accuses me of being too direct.

Back at work, we were having a discussion with our boss about appropriate attire for work. It was a very light conversation where my boss mentioned that every department head is responsible for their team. while discussing this, my boss used the example saying ""this is the reason we normally don't drug test here"", my boss uses THC and so does my sister, I have tried it but I am a fan and it takes a lot for me to feel anything (something to do with my brain, according to my psychiatrist).  I am very open with my boss, and he knows my struggle with medications not working on me as well. the conversation continues as he turns to my sister /HR and says ""this is why I don't test you"" to which I respond ""well she is the base of every rule we need to follow"" she turns to me and says ""what do you mean"" and I respond ""well, because of you position you are expected to follow the rules more so that others"" I could immediately see her annoyed face and goes on to say ""right, like you don't use substances"" to where I was just like ""what do you mean"" our boss interrupted and said "" ok are we done here?"" and we both said yes.

 I go back to my desk and immediately ask her,"" So what did you mean by your comment about me using substances?"" and ask her to explain to me what drugs I use. She says, ""Coffee, Medication, Delta, etc. She and I have tried Delta together, and it works for her, but not for me. I asked her to explain one more time how coffee and medication count as ""substances"", because I have never heard her refer to coffee as a substance, and she said she was in a meeting. I told her we would talk later. 

When I finally got the chance to confront her in person, our conversation went like this:

OP: Why would you say that about me in front of our boss?""

Sister: Well, because it's true.

OP: how so?

Sister: Well, you have used that, and it's not that big of a deal.

OP: It may not be a big deal to you, but it is to me! You saying that I use ""Substances"" in front of my boss is a very big deal to me. Do you know how this makes me look?

Sister: That's on you to figure out. I meant substances like coffee and medication. I didn't mean it in the other way, and if you are taking it that way, that is your business. 

OP: Since when are substances coffee?

I have previously explained to her how important my work reputation is to me, given that I hold a senior position that is higher than hers. As her sister and also in HR, I try to do my best not to ruffle any feathers. to me what she did was really Fucked up, and she saying she had nothing to do with it, that it was a light conversation and she thought we were all joking aroundjust straight up pissed me off. she doubled down and said ""I'm sorry that what i said was taken in the wrong way by our boss and now he will need to talk to you about it but that is your issued and i have nothing to do with it.

I realized that at this point, there was no way for her to understand what she had done, how it had affected me, and how it could have affected her, or how important it was, so I left. 

On my way home, she sent me a text (please see the last picture) with an apology that to me doesn't acknowledge what she did to me.

So am I overreacting???

##In customer service? Transfer the call. Put them on hold.


Act confused. Apologize sweetly. ‚ÄúOh wow, that‚Äôs weird, it usually works.‚Äù


##Have a neighbor who‚Äôs part of that class? Landlord, developer, bootlicker, six-figure crypto bro?

We had to take him to the vet yesterday due to him throwing up black stuff that had the texture of coffee grounds and figured that it was blood after looking into it online. When when we got to the vet they took a x-ray and had notified us that he has a large Mass located right near his stomach. With him being older certain routes are out of the questions such as chemo and surgery since his body wouldn't be able to handle it.  
  
After hearing the news my girlfriend is the distraught and heartbroken as she has had him since she was a kid and has been trying to do as much research as possible. I figured it'd be worth trying to post on here to get advice from professionals or anybody that knows what they're talking about or has been through it personally. We just want him to be comfortable and if possible put them on a regimen that could possibly help cure or better his situation even if it's a tiny bit.  
  
there are a few medications / supplements that she keeps coming across and is trying to see if anybody else has used it or knows anything about it. I will also be including a drop of box link to a photo I took of the X-ray. If anybody is able to read it and tell us what they see we would be extremely grateful. We will be calling the vet soon to ask if there's any medications that they could prescribe to help with some of the symptoms he has. We are trying to help increase his appetite and just calm him as he has been hiding under her brother's bed since all this has been going on and hasn't been eating much.

1m6ik95,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1m6ik95/does_arm_hammer_liquid_detergent_really_deliver/,Does Arm & Hammer Liquid Detergent Really Deliver Powerful Cleaning? Detailed Review,"**Effective Detergent for Tough Stains**  

The Arm & Hammer 033200002611 Plus OxiClean Clean Meadow Liquid Laundry Detergent has been my go-to for the past couple of months, handling everything from my gym clothes to my kids‚Äô grass-stained uniforms. Living in a household where stains are a daily occurrence, this detergent has truly been put to the test. The classic Clean Meadow scent is refreshingly light and lingers delicately on fabrics, giving them a just-washed freshness I‚Äôve grown to love. This product is designed to clean up to 77 medium loads using its 100.5 fluid ounces, and I can confidently say it delivers on that claim, stretching effortlessly across numerous washes.

**Performance You Can Count On**  

I‚Äôve been consistently impressed with the performance of this detergent in both my standard washer and high-efficiency (HE) machine. The 5-in-1 cleaning benefits‚Äîattacking stains, fighting odors, whitening whites, brightening colors, and providing a boost of freshness‚Äîare not mere marketing promises. One particular moment stood out to me when my dog decided to take a nap on a cream-colored throw blanket. Let‚Äôs just say paw prints were everywhere. After a single wash with Arm & Hammer‚Äôs liquid detergent, that blanket looked almost new, with every paw stain gone. The inclusion of OxiClean stain fighters is a real game-changer here; it‚Äôs a powerhouse that tackles tough stains like grease, grass, and even coffee spills without much effort.

[Grab Arm & Hammer 033200002611 at the best price on Amazon now.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0bbnbpqcl/)  

**Benefits**  

- Effectively removes over 101 stains, as advertised, including tough ones like grass and grease.  
- Works well even in cold water settings, saving energy.  
- The Clean Meadow scent is fresh yet subtle, not overpowering.  
- Compatible with both standard and HE washers without clogging sensors.
- Combines baking soda and OxiClean stain removers for a superior clean.   

**Possible Limitations**  

- The cap measuring lines are somewhat difficult to read, which might lead to accidental overuse.  
- While the scent is pleasant, those sensitive to fragrances may find it slightly strong.  
- The detergent is on the bulkier side to handle if you have limited storage space.  

**Design and Usability**  

The detergent bottle is ergonomically designed, featuring a sturdy handle that makes pouring manageable despite its size and weight (6.28 pounds). It‚Äôs worth noting, though, that the cap could use a more intuitive design for measuring. I had to squint under good lighting to decipher the lines for various load sizes, which felt unnecessarily inconvenient. A clear indicator on the cap wouldn‚Äôt hurt. However, the easy-pour spout ensures there‚Äôs minimal dripping, avoiding messy spills around the bottle.

**Why It Works for Families**  

As someone with a busy household, including two kids, a husband, and a Labrador, our laundry pile grows alarmingly fast. This detergent ticked all the right boxes for me. Its ability to tackle stubborn stains while protecting vibrant colors is a blessing. Even items heavily-soiled from outdoor play come out noticeably fresh and spotless. On the weekends, my husband‚Äôs work uniforms‚Äîoften coated in dirt and grease‚Äîget reliably clean in one wash. The product being phosphate-free, ammonia-free, bleach-free, and aluminum-free also assures me it‚Äôs gentle enough for my family while being tough on dirt.

**Advantages**  

- Winning combo of affordability and high-performance cleaning.  
- Environmentally conscious formulation that‚Äôs free of harsh chemicals.    
- Long-lasting bottle‚Äîideal for families doing frequent washing.  

**Disadvantages**  

- Bulky packaging could be challenging to store in compact spaces.  
- Potential issues for people seeking unscented detergent. 

**Competing Brands**  

When comparing this to similar detergents like Tide Plus Ultra Stain Release or Gain Botanicals Plant-Based Detergent, Arm & Hammer‚Äôs liquid detergent holds its own. Tide excels with set-in stains due to its enzymatic formula, but it tends to be pricier. Gain, on the other hand, offers amazing scents but doesn‚Äôt quite match the stain-fighting capabilities of this product. The added benefit of OxiClean in Arm & Hammer gives it an edge when dealing with stubborn messes. For those who want an effective formula that balances affordability with top-notch performance, this option strikes a sweet spot.  

**Value for Money**  

This detergent is an excellent example of cost-effectiveness combined with premium functionality. While it isn‚Äôt the cheapest on the market, every drop feels purposeful, allowing spills and stains to vanish effortlessly without pre-treating. It eliminates the need to buy additional stain removers separately, which can help reduce overall laundry expenses in the long run. That sense of getting so much cleaning power out of one product makes it feel worth the investment for any bustling household.

1m6ik5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1m6ik5o/shadows_in_darkness/,Shadows In Darkness,"Streetlights paint the window pane a hazy shade of gold.
In this quiet room, the silence feels so cold.
Lines are traced on the empty pillow next to someone,
Wondering where a person is, and if they ever think of them.
Remember summer nights, chasing fireflies in the park?
Now every memory feels like a flicker in the dark.

Lost here in the shadows, clinging to the ghosts that were made,
A million scattered moments, a love that's now afraid.
Was it a sudden ending, or a slow and fading grace?
Just shadows in the darkness, leaving no trace.

The coffee‚Äôs cold, the radio plays a song they used to know.
A different city, different streets, a lonely way to go.
Couples are seen laughing, walking hand-in-hand in the rain,
And it stings a little, that familiar, bitter pain.
It was thought that they were written in the stars, you see,
But now the constellations only whisper back.

Lost here in the shadows, clinging to the ghosts that were made,
A million scattered moments, a love that's now afraid.
Was it a sudden ending, or a slow and fading grace?
Just shadows in the darkness, leaving no trace.

They say time heals all wounds, a clich√© they can't abide.
'Cause every sunrise brings a new place for memory to hide.
Walls of strength are built, trying to move on, trying to mend,
But then a scent, a sound, and it‚Äôs back at the dead end.

Lost here in the shadows, clinging to the ghosts that were made,
A million scattered moments, a love that's now afraid.
Was it a sudden ending, or a slow and fading grace?
Just shadows in the darkness, leaving no trace.

Just shadows in the darkness, and the echoing refrain.
Will they ever truly see the light again?
Shadows in darkness... just shadows... in darkness.",1,1753201288.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

1m6ij7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1m6ij7k/why_is_the_cuisinart_mini_prep_plus_food/,Why is the Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus Food Processor Worth Your Attention? Review,"The **Cuisinart DLC-2APK Mini-Prep Plus Food Processor, 24 Ounce, Pink** caught my attention as a compact yet capable food processor. As someone who spends a good amount of time experimenting in the kitchen, whether whipping up homemade salads or grinding fresh spices, I wanted to see if this little gadget could truly hold its own. After a week of daily use, I‚Äôve put it through its paces, and here's everything I‚Äôve experienced.

**Compact and Aesthetic Design**  
This processor's vibrant pink color provides a playful yet elegant touch, making it a stylish addition to any kitchen. Its small, compact size (at just 9.25 inches high) ensures it occupies minimal counter or storage space‚Äîa big plus if you‚Äôre dealing with limited kitchen real estate. Despite its small frame, the build doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy. The durable plastic body gives a lightweight feel without compromising sturdiness.

**Functionality with Precision**  
Featuring a reversible stainless-steel blade, this nifty appliance is all about versatility. I tested both its chop and grind functions extensively‚Äîthe chopping blade handled delicate herbs and garlic effortlessly, while the grinding blade tackled harder foods like nuts and even coffee beans with surprising efficiency. Operating it is straightforward; its pulse control button allows for precision, ensuring you don‚Äôt turn your chunky guacamole into a soup.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact size is perfect for small kitchens or minimalists.
- Auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides excellent control for different consistencies.
- Dishwasher-safe bowl and lid simplify cleanup immensely.
- Operation is smooth and quiet for a food processor this powerful.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The 3-cup work bowl capacity might feel limiting for larger batches.
- If you attempt to process liquids beyond the recommended fill level, leaks can occur around the edges.
- The blade‚Äôs sharpness requires extra caution during cleaning as it‚Äôs easy to nick yourself.  

**User Convenience and Cleaning**  
As someone who dreads post-cooking cleanup, the dishwasher-safe bowl and lid were life savers. The spatula that comes with the product is a thoughtful touch, allowing you to scrape every bit of pesto or hummus out of the bowl. However, I‚Äôd recommend manually washing the blade to maintain its sharpness. The hidden cord storage came in handy, ensuring the cord didn‚Äôt tangle with other appliances on my countertop.

**Performance and Motor Strength**  
For a processor with a 250-watt motor, it punches above its weight class. It made fast work of preparing purees and breaking down hard spices. While I wouldn‚Äôt dare compare it to commercial processors, it‚Äôs more than capable of handling day-to-day needs like chopping onions, grinding seeds, or blending sauces. I even used it to make baby food for my niece, and it produced smooth, consistent results.

**Product Contenders**  
Compared to its most direct competitor, the KitchenAid Mini Food Processor, the Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus feels neck-and-neck in several aspects. Both models offer compact sizes and multi-functional blades, but Cuisinart‚Äôs reversible blade design provides slightly more versatility. On the other hand, the KitchenAid model edges ahead in bowl capacity, handling up to 3.5 cups. However, at a nearly identical price range, the durability and aesthetics of the Cuisinart unit make it my personal favorite for lighter home-use tasks.

**Worth Every Penny**  
While pricing shifts over time, I found the product worth its cost. Its features align well within its price range, making it a great value for households that don‚Äôt need a full-sized processor. The thoughtful design details, including the BPA-free materials and the integrated cord storage, seal the deal for me. Its versatility makes it suitable for single users, small families, or those looking for backup processors without breaking the bank.

I've posted the first seven chapters so far and it's part of a three part series covering roughly the first three seasons but profiting from later season characters and backstory. Hindsight is 20/20 and I'm using it. Emma has a somewhat altered backstory and a greater emphasis on the roguish aspects of her personality, and while it's a swanqueen fic, it isn't focused entirely on the relationship, but explores the entire story up through season 3. 

There's nothing NSFW in this post but there are a few NSFW chapters planned, so not for children!

A small excerpt from the latest chapter:

‚ÄúYeah, thanks Sneezy,‚Äù August says with a bright smile.

Scowling, Sneezy says, ‚ÄúExcuse me? Do you think you‚Äôre funny? Like I don‚Äôt get enough flak from the kids around here.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I just-‚Äù August tries to explain, but to no avail.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be $11.99. Cash or card?‚Äù Sneezy asks. Or Mr. Clark, August supposes.

Doing the math quickly in his head, August says, ‚ÄúHold on, the sandwich was $3.99 and the coffee was $3.50 on the tags.‚Äù He gestures towards the fridge where he‚Äôd grabbed his food.

Mr. Clark says, ‚ÄúWell now it‚Äôs $11.99. Cash or card?‚Äù¬†

Forget Mr. Clark; the curse turned Sneezy into Grumpy. August sighs. This was the worst part. Knowing these people, even though they don‚Äôt know themselves. ‚ÄúCash,‚Äù he says, slapping the bills on the counter.¬†

The door‚Äôs bell chimes as August steps outside, squinting against the daylight.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôd say he undercharged you, given how much you have lining your pockets.‚Äù

August draws up short. Emma‚Äôs lounging on his motorcycle, using his helmet as an armrest. A bright yellow boot on the front wheel makes it clear he won‚Äôt be riding anywhere soon.¬†

‚ÄúThey do call us starving artists for a reason,‚Äù August says nonchalantly.

Emma shrugs. ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm no cop. That said, you are going to have to come with me. My boss would like a word with you.‚Äù

Making a split second decision, August teases, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôd rather have a word with you,‚Äù before breaking into a full sprint down the street.",0,1753201128.0,OnceUponATime,1,0.5,False
