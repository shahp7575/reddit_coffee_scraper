1j8ncev,https://v.redd.it/705haanlb1oe1,Moka pot coffee liquor,"A recipe I made for Christmas, it was very good and easy to make. Makes up for an appreciated gift for your friends and relatives all year round.

For 1 liter of finished liquor, you need:

- 450-500 gr brewed coffee
- 300 gr sugar (add more or less depending on the sweetness you want to achieve)
- (optional) vanilla extract/seeds, anise stars or other spices of your choice
- 250 gr 96% alcohol

I suggest using a medium to dark roast coffee with good body and caramel, chocolate and nutty notes, don‚Äôt bother with acidity because the sugar will neuter it.

Instructions:

- brew the total amount of coffee into a pot and keep the lid on as you fill it each time with new coffee 
- place the pot on the stove, add the sugar with the spices you optionally added and turn on your gas stove or whatever on a low setting, you need to raise the temperature a bit to allow the sugar to completely melt while you keep stirring until it‚Äôs dissolved (DO NOT BRING TO A BOIL OR > 80¬∫C)
- let the coffee syrup rest until it cools down and becomes warm, then add the alcohol and mix
- using a funnel and a ladle, fill your bottles with the liquor
- close the bottles, shake them and place them in a dark place for 14 days while shaking them once every day 

Once they‚Äôre ready, remember to give the bottles a shake before drinking the liquor to allow the sugar at the bottom to dissolve and redistribute.

I asked if they could replace it if I got ADP now and they said no damage incurred before having ADP could be replaced. so in the end, I decided not to repair the laptop since I could live with the dents. however, I did buy ADP after that incident since it was on sale and I was thinking that I could replace other parts if ever damaged. 
fast forward to today, I had spilled coffee on my laptop. screen glitched and stopped working. what I was wondering was if the ADP I bought would be covered for this? I read on here that someone reported an issue with their laptop before getting ADP and after when their laptop was damaged, lenovo refused to fix their laptop. im worried because I had previously reported the dents  on the laptop and the camera not working intermittently. if they get back to me saying they won‚Äôt fix my laptop because it already had damages, what could I do?

Here are some reasons why i believe they have become worse

1. poor reliability. My family has had a 2014 KIA Sorento for 6 years and have never had a major problem. Meanwhile i know many people who have bought the new EV range, such as the EV6 and EV9, and have had problems in the first 12 months of ownership.

2. Poor design. Personally, when it comes to design KIA are not cooking at the moment. The new Tasman looks extremley ugly imho and as a post said before, the K4 is terrible. KIA are even messing up the wheels! I was at a coffee shop recently and a brand-new Picanto had swastika shaped rims!

3. bad decision making. Who in their right mind would think its a good idea to enter into the most competitive markets with no defining factors to their product? The ute market in Australia is extremely competitive with stuff like the Hilux, Ranger, D-max, Triton and Navara, so why would they enter a ugly bland new ute to it?

Thanks for reading guys, pls dont take this too seriously as its just my opinion. I really love KIA but i dont think they are making very smart decisions atm.",0,1741687191.0,CarsAustralia,4,0.5,False

1j8n5jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j8n5jo/that_night_in_burnton/,That Night In Burnton,"A couple of years ago, tail end of the pandemic, I was sent on an overnight work trip to Burnton, a small picturesque seaside town about five hours away from the big city where we live.¬†



This is the story of what happened that night.¬†



I was done with my meetings later in the afternoon. We drove into the hotel parking lot- me and my wife Hilda. It had been a hard day- a long early morning drive to Burnton, followed by a series of intense meetings with development people. Everyone was excited, land prices were going up like crazy in this sleepy forgotten town- old houses that were on the market for ten years were shifting like hot cakes. But by 5 pm my¬† energy was dwindling. I was dying to get to my hotel room and unwind. I know my wife Hilda was looking forward to it too- she had opted to travel with me -which was quite unusual for a work trip. I put it down to her being bored from going nowhere in the pandemic, and it was nice enough to have her with me, and it seemed like she had had a pleasant afternoon in town while I was at my meetings, in the local coffeeshops and by the beach. But she looked tired and drawn too.



The first thing that caught our attention was the police car, neatly parked by the main entrance. Then I spotted a couple yellow and orange police barriers, folded away and lying to the side. We didn‚Äôt think much of it, but there was no doubt the receptionist, as she checked us in, looked somewhat worried and tense. I gestured outside, ‚ÄúLooks like you‚Äôve been having some excitement here!‚Äù I remarked amiably.



She gave a little nervous laugh. ‚ÄúOh yes, well, very sad, but the police presence is going to be over in an hour and I am sure you‚Äôll have an excellent night stay with us!‚Äù She smiled brightly at me, all her teeth showing.



At the same time my wife, who had been chatting to someone in the lobby behind me, swept up to the counter. ‚ÄúYou had a murder here last night? And you weren‚Äôt going to tell us?‚Äù she demanded.



I felt bad for the poor receptionist. She flushed and started stammering ‚ÄúMr Winters said‚Ä¶ it- it wasn‚Äôt necessary to alarm the g-g-guests- police agreed- they arrested the culprits anyway-‚Äù

My wife said in an imperious voice ‚ÄúI am sure I would like to know if I am sleeping across a murder scene!‚Äù



My heart sank. I was dropping from fatigue and at that point, I didn‚Äôt care if the Massacre of the Innocents had happened in the lobby, I needed a lie down, followed by a nice warm bath with plenty of that snazzy hotel bath stuff, and then room service. I gave Hilda a pleading look.

She read my mind through the marital wireless all us married folk have. She shrugged, snatched up the keycards, and marched off towards the elevator. I followed gratefully.



In the elevator, she said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt blame me if we get slaughtered in our beds tonight‚Äù



I was mildly surprised. Hilda is a stoic, unimaginative woman, not given to fanciful or paranoid musings. ‚ÄúOh Hilda, you heard the poor girl- it wasn‚Äôt a random attack and they arrested the murderer anyway. Even the police are leaving.‚Äù



She shrugged again.



We stepped out of the elevator. Looking round to find our door, it was impossible to ignore more barriers and yellow crime tape further down the corridor.



Hilda exclaimed ‚ÄúChrist it actually happened on our floor?!‚Äù



I muttered and pointed to our door ‚Äúthere we are dear, room 202. Ocean view, just like you asked. Did you want to order room service?‚Äù



She rolled her eyes, and we swiped in our room, about three doors down from the taped off murder room.



Finally, I was soaking in my bath, smelling the heavenly lavender. Hilda was on her laptop, and¬†



I heard her call out. ‚ÄúIt was a stabbing- there‚Äôs some tweets about it.‚Äù

I grunted something.



She called again ‚ÄúActually, seems like they were local business owners who had a disagreement that got out of hand. I‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt hear anything at your meeting tod-‚Äù



I turned on the faucets and dipped my head under the foamy frothy water, blocking out her voice to a distant rumble.



Hours later, I woke up to the sounds of men‚Äôs voices. I knew instantly where I was but for a moment I thought they were in my room, the voices were so loud and clear.



It would be impossible to fall back asleep with that noise. I had another long day ahead- plus the drive back to the city, and I felt furious. I wanted to call the front desk, but didn‚Äôt want to risk waking Hilda. I looked at her rolled up body in the duvet, turned away from me.



The voices were getting louder, although I couldn‚Äôt understand a word of what was being said. I decided to get out of bed, and go downstairs and complain.



The hotel room wasn‚Äôt too dark, and I slipped outside pulling on my jacket over my pajamas.¬†



The corridor was lit with only two lights. I noticed the spectacularly ugly carpet, and the¬†

terrible pattern made me feel dizzy for a moment. I looked up and noticed the police barriers and tape had gone. The police must have come in after we checked into our room. For some reason the thought made me even more unsettled.



The voices sounded a bit more muffled through the corridor, and I contemplated going back to bed. As I paused, my hand still on the door knob, I heard a sudden, loud shout- louder than anything before. I froze in fear.



Then silence.



How come other guests were not rushing out? Or complaining?



As I stood still in the corridor, fearful and uncertain what to do, the door three down from ours opened and a man staggered out, bent double, holding his stomach. He saw me, and started coming towards me. Even in the dim light, I could see the blood trickling through his fingers.



‚ÄúWilliam, no!‚Äù somebody cried from the room. ‚ÄúGet him!‚Äù



The staggering man reached towards me with his bloody hands and grasped at my pajama shirt. ‚ÄúHelp me!‚Äù he gasped.



I knew what he wanted from me, but I couldn‚Äôt risk my job, my life with Hilda. And I was afraid of the men in the room, of what they could do to me if I helped William. I desperately untangled his clutching fingers from my pajama shirt.



Two other men stepped outside. ‚ÄúWilliam!‚Äù one of them roared. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stop us!‚Äù They tore him away from me, dragged him further back down the corridor, and back into the room they had come out from.



I thought they couldn‚Äôt see me, but just before they vanished inside, one of them turned, looked straight at me and winked.



My blood ran cold.



The door slammed shut behind them. The sound broke my paralysis. I turned and went back inside my own room.



I knew perfectly well what was happening. I am not crazy. I was dreaming. This was a dream, about the events that possibly had happened the night before we arrived. It was nothing to do with my job- nothing to do with me at all. I was doing nothing wrong. Everything was correct and above board.



I fell back into a deep sleep.



I woke up very early. Hilda was still fast asleep -she must have taken sleeping pills last night- I hated when she did that.



I got up, extremely refreshed and alert, I could remember the dream from last night very clearly. But I was equally clear it had just been a dream, and I was ready to shower, wake up¬† Hilda and drive off, leaving that godawful town behind me and hopefully never to return. I didn't even want their complimentary breakfast - I decided we would stop for coffee on the way, although I knew it would be another tussle with Hilda to get her to agree to forgo the endless bacon promised by the hotel buffet.¬†



I stepped into the bathroom and turned on the light. Turned on the taps, and glanced down.



And saw the bloody handprint smears, still bright scarlet, burning on my pajama shirt.

1j8n54w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j8n54w/is_this_relationship_still_worth_saving/,is this relationship still worth saving?,"I posted this on another sub originally but many people irl and comments told me i was being abused so, i came here i guess. 

I feel like an absolute idiot crying on reddit but i cant talk to anyone since he goes through my chats and all my friends would snitch on me anyways. To my luck he doesnt know english so this is my only outlet right now.

Or if he does find it at least this would end the relationship cuz right now i dont have the balls to do so. 

So, me (19FtM) and my partner (21FtM) (lets just call him Chris) have been dating a little over half a year. 

The beginning was beautiful, as usual‚Äîlike a fucking fairytale, pink fog and everything. We met through a shared friend group about a year and a half ago, though I was in a relationship at the time. He also dated multiple people while we were still just friends.

We quickly became really close, for whatever reason‚Äîsimilar identities, shared interests, all that jazz. I started visiting his place regularly, along with a few of our other friends, and it became a habit for the whole group. My girlfriend at the time never tagged along; she preferred hanging out with the guy she later cheated on me with.

Eventually, I found out about the cheating, and we broke up. After that, I got even closer to Chris. I spent a lot of time at his place, and we developed a bond like we were brothers.

Not long after (by then, I had basically moved into his place since my mother kicked me out), he half-assedly confessed his feelings for me. At first, I was like ooh hell nahh I just got broken up with, humiliated, and now my best friend wants to fuck?? I kindly and very subtly rejected him. The whole conversation was one of those ""Bro, wouldn‚Äôt it be funny if we dated?"" type deals, so I assumed it was a joke and left it at that. For a while, it seemed like it really was just that‚Äîa joke.

Then I started dating around again. Partly because I wanted to forget my ex, partly because I enjoyed the freedom. During that time, Chris and I had a more serious talk about his feelings. I told him that maybe I felt something too, but I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it being serious. I‚Äôve always had trouble distinguishing between platonic and romantic attraction, and our friendship was way too important to risk. Besides, I wasn‚Äôt mentally stable enough for anything long-term, and I knew he meant long-term.

I meant what I said. I am severely mentally ill (none of you are surprsied i bet) and aware that I can never maintain a fulfilling relationship. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt Chris, so I thought it was a bad idea. There was also another concern‚Äîone that might sound weird to some, but whatever. Chris identifies as a lesbian but uses a male name and refers to himself as a boy most of the time (but not always). He only likes and dates AFAB people. So I asked, ""How would this even work?"" I mean, yes, I am biologically female, but I pass as male 99% of the time, look masculine, live as a man, and will be on HRT soon. I didn‚Äôt think a lesbian would want that. So, we left the question open.

Then I got into a fucked-up almost-relationship with some random dude. It wasn‚Äôt serious‚Äîwe lived far apart, met up maybe twice a month, had occasional sex, sent good morning texts, that sort of thing. He visited this place a few times (which I always asked Chris about beforehand, multiple times, only allowing it if he assured me it was 1000% fine). Sometimes, I spent weekends at his place. It was all over the place.

Then Chris confessed again. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I thought we had already discussed why it wouldn‚Äôt work.

A night filled with too many emotions and too much alcohol led to him wanting to run away from the country‚Äîagain. He threatens to do that every couple of months. I was drunk and desperate for the only person I thought I could fully trust at the time (which was, yes, Chris). He had me in a chokehold‚Äîfiguratively. I saw my ex-best friend in him, the one person who had always been there for me, but also left. (im still coming to terms with losing that son of a bitch). I couldn‚Äôt afford to lose that comfort again. So, very drunk, I told him I loved him too, and we ended up together. Which, yes, i guess i loved him. And still lvoe him in a way. 

And yes, I cheated on that guy. I‚Äôm still not sure if we were even in an actual relationship, but I still feel sick to my stomach whenever I think about it. Even if he was toxic, I was never the type of mf to cheat.

Anyway, we got engaged two months into the relationship. Yeah, I know‚Äîway too sudden.

The beginning was fine, if you ignore the red flags. The fights.

Now, couples fight, right? Of course they do. But oh my god, this cannot be normal. Please tell me I‚Äôm not going insane or just being dramatic‚Äîthis really isn‚Äôt how it‚Äôs supposed to go.

I‚Äôll start with our first big fight.

So, my now-ex started calling Chris‚Äô phone, telling him I wouldn‚Äôt be happy with him, that I will leave him anyways, that kind of shit. I had no idea this was happening. He also told Chris that I was secretly still dating him, which‚Äîhow the fuck could I be? Since the day Chris and I got together, I hadn‚Äôt stepped foot outside the house without him by my side. I had also blocked my ex after a long, detailed breakup text.

Chris didn‚Äôt ask me about it. He kept it a secret for days. Then, when one of his siblings was over (of course), he decided to make a big fucking circus out of it.

He kept repeating, ""Is there something you wanna tell me?"" all day.

I was like, ""The fuck? No?""

Then he snapped‚Äîstarted yelling, calling me a disgusting snake, a bitch, saying I was still with my ex and should go back to sucking his dick. You know, the usual.

That was the first time I felt that weird tug in my gut‚Äîmy best friend today.

He looked feral.

I knew he wasn‚Äôt going to hit me, but I was still scared. I grew up in a house where verbal abuse and screaming were the norm. In the midst of a panic attack, I begged him to believe me‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt spoken to my ex since the day we got together.

Chris eventually calmed down and gave me a half-assed apology. Then (allegedly) told my ex to fuck off.

After that, things seemed fine again. Honeymoon phase was cool. Sex was nice. But I just‚Ä¶ stopped seeing my friends.

Chris never wanted to hang out with big groups anymore. Our friendgroup dissapeared. I don‚Äôt drink all the time, but I like to go out with the bros and get smashed on the weekend, y‚Äôknow? Well, fuck that. He said I did stupid shit when I was drunk. So, I stopped drinking.

We stayed home. All the time.

I waved goodbye to my privacy and me-time too. The only time I could be alone was when I was taking a shit. Literally. Right now, as I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm in the bathroom.

It got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt even visit my parents. One time, I went to see my dad for a day and a half. Right before I left, Chris got mad about something and threatened to kill himself (not to me directly). Then, while I was at my dad‚Äôs, he called me saying, ""Man, my shit was laced, I think I‚Äôm gonna die."" Then he stopped picking up my calls while I was crying my fucking eyes out.

When I rushed back, he was sitting on the bed. Completely fine.

I have more stories like this, but you get the idea.

When I tried visiting my friend 'Dave' ‚Äîwho will be a major character later on‚Äîit was worse. Dave is younger, plays in a band, and has been a good friend for years. He‚Äôs also completely straight. As far as he knows, I‚Äôm a cis man, so our bond is purely platonic.

But when I got home from visiting Dave and his band (it wasnt even anything like that, we met up for an evening and some drinks, then i slept at my cousins place who lived im the same city) Chris half-jokingly started theorizing about me secretly meeting my ex, cheating on him, and all that shit again. I reassured him, told him it was just Dave and his friends.

Months passed, and as the pink fog wore off, little things started to bug me.

Like how he was the only one allowed to be mad. If I, even for a second, showed the slightest hint of annoyance, I was told to calm the fuck down and to stop being a bitch to him. So I thought, Fine, I'll just turn my anger inward. I've been doing that all my life anyway. I'll just fuck off, I guess.

And so I did. My health got worse. Anxiety got worse. Stomach problems got worse- i have celiac disease and multiple health issues ehich are just, making me miserable by today. 

Then came the favors. He asked me to do everything. Not big things, just small, constant requests‚ÄîFind my glasses, get me a cup of coffee, make me toast. But even if his glass was right next to him, I had to get up from across the room to hand it to him because, 'Oh, I didn‚Äôt see it.' And if I dared to refuse, even once, the passive-aggressive bullshit followed‚ÄîI‚Äôll never ask anyone for anything again, Fine, I‚Äôll do it myself, I do everything alone anyway, None of you could do shit without me, I‚Äôll just do everything then.

I didn‚Äôt care. I couldn‚Äôt be alone. He meant too much. I must be too lazy. This is normal.

Then more fights happened. Whenever something was wrong, he‚Äôd go completely silent, waiting for me to guess what the problem was. And when I didn‚Äôt do anything‚Äîbecause I didn‚Äôt know there was an issue to begin with‚Äîhe‚Äôd snap. He‚Äôd scream, blame it all on me. And yeah, maybe it was my fault most of the time, but wasn‚Äôt there a better way to talk about it? Still, I‚Äôd apologize while having a breakdown, and we‚Äôd repeat the cycle every time we disagreed on something.

If I made a mistake, it was my fault.
If he made a mistake, it was also my fault.

But that was fine. I‚Äôd rather take the blame than tell him he was wrong and get yelled at again. Or make him mad. He wouldn‚Äôt hurt me, but he would yell. He‚Äôd give me the silent treatment. He‚Äôd lash out at everyone else in the household. He‚Äôd be passive-aggressive. And I just couldn‚Äôt deal with that.

And so this went on for months.

Now we‚Äôre here. The past four or five weeks of my life have been a battle with my own mind after a few particularly eye-opening fights and conversations.

First, there was THE Fight.

I was at my therapist's. I had promised to take Chris to a job interview afterward. But after my session, my therapist insisted on taking me to a thrift store because I had an interview the next day too and she knew i had absolutely no clothes. She wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer. So, I got home late.

Chris snapped. Screamed at me.

At this point, I was just hollow. I sat there and took. Just let him say what he needed to say. And yeah, he was right‚ÄîI fucked up. I should‚Äôve been home, I promised. That was my fault. I apologized.

He kept going. I got overwhelmed, had a breakdown in the bathroom.

An hour later, he called me out like nothing had happened.

The Next Morning

He was acting weird. I was used to it, but still, I felt sick‚Äîlike I had to be on my toes.

Then it hit.

He had gone through my phone and seen my messages with Dave. Dave has this way of talking‚Äîhe calls everyone babe and baby. But he‚Äôs straight, he has a girlfriend, we‚Äôre just bros. Chris knows this. He‚Äôs known what my friendship with Dave is like for two years.

But now, suddenly, it‚Äôs a problem.

He starts going off‚Äîaccusing me of cheating with Dave, saying I never change, saying he‚Äôs asked me so many times for so much and I‚Äôve never tried to be better. He tells me he‚Äôs had enough and thanks me for these six months but he‚Äôs done.

I just sat there on our bed and said, Okay. If you‚Äôll be happier, then okay.

Then he disappeared for a little while.

Our roommate, (lets just call her Peep for now) tried to talk to me. But what the fuck was I supposed to say? Anything I told her would just end up in Chris‚Äôs ear, and he‚Äôd find a way to use it against me.

After that, I was acting weird (understandably, I hope). I was jumpy. Out of it.
(Chris, apparently, doesn‚Äôt remember breaking up with me.)

The Weed

One day, we were supposed to go run errands in the city, but he got completely zooted out of his mind.

(Weed is another problem in our relationship. He‚Äôs an addict. I‚Äôve tried to get him to cut back‚Äîhe himself admitted it was a problem. He quit for a little while but relapsed and just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt care anymore.)

So I was like, Okay, I‚Äôll just go alone.

I went into the city, got what I needed, and accidentally ran into some friends. They tagged along, and in exchange, I did too. It added maybe 30 minutes to my trip.

I called Chris before confirming I‚Äôd stay out longer, but he didn‚Äôt listen. He just started screaming at me through the phone, calling me names and shit. My friends heard all of it.

And for the first time, someone asked me, Is this an everyday thing?

I said, Yeah.

And they told me, Bro, this isn‚Äôt normal.

And I just sat there like, oh. 

Back to the Weed Thing

This part is my absolute favorite.

Like, BRO, I have a tendency towards addiction. I was addicted to harder shit before. I refuse to go through that again. And yeah i still drink sometimes, but barely. That‚Äôs it. I dont do drugs anymore. 

And this motherfucker gets mad at me when I refuse to smoke with him.

Like BRO.

We are broke. We barely have enough money to feed the damn dog (which, by the way, is somehow my fault too‚Äîeven though he was the one who wanted the damn thing in the first place). We barely have enough to feed ourselves. But he‚Äôs out here burning our last pennies on weed and then blaming me for not wanting to participate?

I don‚Äôt like how weed makes me feel when I smoke a lot. Once in a while is fine, but it‚Äôs just not my thing.

And he gets mad.

Says I‚Äôm not fun anymore. Says he misses who I was‚Äîthe person who was always down for stupid shit.

I was down for stupid shit because I didn‚Äôt care if I woke up the next day or not. That was one of the worst, darkest periods of my life. Of course I didn‚Äôt care.

Now I‚Äôm better.

And apparently, that‚Äôs boring.

Well, sorry for that, I guess.

If that helps, I think I‚Äôll be slipping back into that spiral soon anyway.

The Queer Thing

And the way he‚Äîan undeniably queer person himself‚Äîjust ignores my identity?

He knows how bad my dysphoria can get. He knows how much I‚Äôve struggled, been in psychwards, had a severe ED, SH problem because of it, and he still calls me girl or princess or some other bullshit.

And when I get upset, I‚Äôm the one in the wrong.

Then he joked about calling me husband and how I‚Äôll never be his husband. But I won‚Äôt be his wife either, because if he calls me wife, I‚Äôll bitch about it.

And I was like, Bro, you knew who you were getting with when we started this. I told you‚ÄîI will never be your girlfriend. I will never be anyone‚Äôs girlfriend.

And he just goes, Well, yeah, but you know who I am too. And I‚Äôm a lesbian.

So what? Should I just‚Ä¶ un-trans myself for him?

What the fuck am I supposed to do?

Our shared therapist thinks he has BPD. She told me I need to leave him ASAP.

Most of our friends have expressed concern too. My mom says I should quit, because my dad did the same thing with her and she should've ran back then (yes, i know, i have severe daddy issues as well).

But i cant leave him just like that-i know hes not a bad person. I know theres good under that, hes broken as hell but not like this because he wants to be. But im tired and i know i wont be the one to fix him. 
But if i leave him? He will kill himself. Or worse, his family will come after me. 

So here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. I know relationships have ups and downs. I know people fight. But I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells 24/7. I feel like I can‚Äôt have a life outside of him without it turning into a disaster. I feel like I can‚Äôt be upset about anything because it‚Äôll just turn into a fight where I‚Äôm the villain no matter what.

I‚Äôve always thought that love is supposed to make you feel safe, but I don‚Äôt feel safe. Not in a physical way‚Äîhe‚Äôs never hit me, and I don‚Äôt think he ever would‚Äîbut emotionally? Mentally? I feel trapped.
There was a time when this wholw thing felt like the best thing in my life. Where i was sure Chris was the one. And sometimes, that feeling resurfaces, if even for a few minutes, it's there enough to keep me hoping. And I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm the one being unreasonable here. He doesnt know i want to break up. Hell, even im not sure if i want to. But he feels something is off and hes been more irritable and on my ass for everything since. 

So, what the fuck do i do for real? ",1,1741686799.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Firstly, the quantities for phases are so minuscule that there's no point in creating a fully automated factory. Most phase project items require fewer than 20 stacks of product. By the time you finish your new factory, the ""2 items/minute"" setup already gets you through the phase and to the end game, with subsequent stages requiring even less product. Seriously, what's with that? Phase 8 requires 500 Assembly Directors, but Phase 9 only needs 250?! Coffee Stain, did you miss a digit there?

Milestones become banal the moment you attach your first sink to Smart Platings and Automated Wirings. By mid-game, you have enough tickets to buy most customization options from the AWESOME Shop plus all the items needed to unlock milestones. The ability to purchase items from the sink is probably the game's single most detrimental feature, allowing players to skip huge chunks of progression with minimal prep in the previous stage.

Lastly, the motivation to build a factory just isn't there. As fun as constructing a factory is, doing it to meet the small amount of products needed for phases defeats the point. 

Worst of all, this diminishes ADA's role, as it no longer comes across as a snarky AI but rather one that indicates the scope was cut down so much that players are expected to do the bare minimum. If that's what the game expects, it's hard to get excited about doing more. The final phase, in particular, was disappointing due to its lack of challenge.

Overall, it's a great game. It will receive a positive review, and I will share it with friends. But by the end of the day, there's a bitter taste left in my mouth. I wish there was a New Game+ without AWESOME Shop parts and with 5 or 10x recipe costs per phase.",0,1741685772.0,SatisfactoryGame,6,0.2,False

In **'My Morning Routine'** by Benjamin Spall and Michael Xander, the authors explore the morning habits of 64 accomplished individuals, from CEOs and athletes to artists and authors, revealing how they use their first hours to set a positive and productive tone for the day.

**Key takeaways from their morning rituals include:**

- **Purposeful Wake-Up:** Having a meaningful motivation to get up early‚Äîlike MIT President Leo Rafael Reif tackling important tasks before dawn, or author Caroline Paul savoring quiet reading time.

- **Peak Productivity Hours:** Many reserve mornings for critical, distraction-free tasks. For instance, entrepreneur Sheena Brady dedicates mornings exclusively to her business, while Ryan Holiday avoids checking emails until he completes a significant task.

- **Morning Exercise:** A majority incorporate workouts into their routines, like Olympic swimmer Caroline Burckle using morning sessions as 'moving meditation,' and executive Sherry Lansing mixing Pilates and cardio to stay energized and balanced.

- **Meditation and Mindfulness:** Over half of those interviewed practice meditation. Pixar President Ed Catmull dedicates 30-60 minutes daily, finding it essential for calm and clarity, while others integrate mindfulness into simple daily activities like making coffee.

- **'Me Time':** Successful mornings aren't solely about productivity; they're also about personal enrichment. Artist Elle Luna starts her day by recording dreams, and illustrator Yuko Shimizu adds reading into her commute, boosting creativity.

- **Evening Prep for Morning Success:** Quality sleep and nighttime routines matter. Arianna Huffington prioritizes eight hours of rest, while Nir Eyal disconnects from the internet at night to ensure restful sleep.

- **Adaptability and Flexibility:** Life happens‚Äîespecially with kids, travel, or unpredictable schedules. Embracing flexibility, parents and frequent travelers alike find ways to adapt their routines without losing momentum.

Ultimately, there's no one-size-fits-all morning routine. The key lies in discovering what habits resonate with you, refining them over time, and building a morning ritual that energizes, inspires, and prepares you for daily success.

In normal circumstances, her visits can easily become a burden as I have so much to do to entertain her.

She also does not do house chores. With lots of efforts she might do the dishes occasionally. She does not cook. When in my place she is (or pretends to be) incapable of even lighting the stove and making herself some coffee. She couldn‚Äôt open my apartment door with the keys (too heavy). She refuses to even do groceries in a place near my apartment, because here ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt know how it works‚Äù. 

I love her dearly, but she does have a tendency to talk non stop, and babies and motherhood are her favorite topics of all time. She loves recalling when me and my brother were small and can retell the same stories over and over and over. She hasn‚Äôt handled a baby since then, though, and I am 36yo. She is 74.

She is mildlyno because she is nice to be around for 80% of the time, but there is a 20% when she gets very attention seeking, self centered, making inappropriate comments and gets on my nerves. For her it is hard to just take a back sit and relax, she wants to be center of attention and main character in most situations. 

I am struggling to decide if I want her here for the delivery or if I should tell her to come a few weeks later. 

My husband is very supportive and active with domestic chores (cooks, cleans, does it all), and we can afford paid help too. 

My mother could either stay with us or in a hotel, but the hotel reservations and any occurrences would have to be managed by me, my husband would have to pick her up and drive her every day to our place, I would be worried how she is managing in the city by herself when she is not with us‚Ä¶ every time she visited when we she would go out by herself it would be an adventure and she would message me all her way the whole time with pictures and describing where she was (touristic spots). Even when she travelled to visit a friend nearby she messaged me all day long about it. 

What would you do? What was your postpartum experience with elder mother participation?

Wibhoo here. We‚Äôre on a mission to make conscious living mainstream in India, and we need a¬†**Tech Lead**¬†to help us build the damn thing.

**The TL;DR:**

* üõ†Ô∏è¬†**Wha**t: Founding Tech Lead role for a GPS-based platform connecting eco-conscious consumers with sustainable businesses.
* üåç¬†**Wh**y: To fight greenwashing and make sustainability accessible (yes, we‚Äôre that idealistic).
* üíª¬†**Skills Neede**d: Full-stack wizardry, scalable systems, and a love for¬†*tech that does goo*d.
* üí∞¬†**Compensatio**n: Equity (you own a slice) + eternal gratitude (and chai).
* üö©¬†**Catc**h: Volunteer role until funding (\~6‚Äì8 months). Founder‚Äôs in the same boat.
* **üõ©Early Stage Adventure**: We're past the napkin-idea stage.¬†**MVP is in sight**! We're a team of¬†**5 super passionate folk**s (founder included!), got some¬†**fellowships, grants, and even some recognition**s (bragging rights!). We're¬†**onboarding vendors in Pune RIGHT NO**W. So, you're not joining a total newbie operation. We've been grinding for a year already.

**The Deets:**  
**We‚Äôre Building**:  
A platform where users discover sustainable products/services¬†*near them*¬†(think ‚ÄúGoogle Maps for conscious living‚Äù).

**You‚Äôll Do**:

* Lead development of our app/website (React, Node.js, AWS, etc.).
* Build GPS-based search, vendor dashboards, and AI-driven recommendations.
* Literally code the future of sustainable consumption.

**You Are**:

* A¬†**full-stack ninja**¬†with 3+ years of experience.
* Obsessed with clean code and scalable architecture.
* Passionate about sustainability (or at least¬†*not*¬†allergic to it).
* Willing to grind in a startup (read: wear 10 hats, drink 5 coffees, sleep 4 hours).

**The Fine Print (No Bullshit):**

* This is a¬†**volunteer role**¬†until we secure funding (founder‚Äôs unpaid too).
* Equity is significant ‚Äì you‚Äôre a¬†**co-founder**, not an employee.
* Willing to shift to Pune. (Initial remote is okay but need to hands-on play with us in few months).

**Why Bother?**

* Build something that¬†*actually*¬†helps the planet.
* Skip corporate BS ‚Äì we‚Äôre a small team with big dreams.
* Flex your tech skills for a cause (LinkedIn humblebrag material).

**How to Apply:**  
Drop a comment/DM or email on¬†[rohan@wibhoo.in](mailto:rohan@wibhoo.in)¬†with:

1. Your LinkedIn/portfolio/resume.
2. A meme that sums up your coding philosophy.
3. Why you give a damn about sustainability.

I got there on the reporting day  and I was assigned to a technical mentor. A cool guys that taught me so much more than what I learnt in my 4 year degree. I could swear he looked familiar but it couldn't place his face. Fast forward I came to learn that we went to the same high school but he was 2 years ahead of me and that where I knew him from. 

We quickly became friends and coz we had a lot of shared interests and hobbies soon enough I was invited to their family events where I met his sister who is foine asf by the police way. We vibed almost immediately and somewhere along the way we started dating.ie (my mentor's sister and I). During this period my mentor got into a relationship with a chic that was still in uni and it is as going well. All four of us would go on double dates have date night's and shit like that. So basically, we are all friends and more like family if I may say so.

A few months ago my mentor helped the girlfriend get an internship at the company and shortly after he's involved in an  insubordination situation and ends up losing his job and not even a month later he lands another job  through his uncle.The girlfriend is still interning at our company and we are good friends I consider her a sister.

At the begging of this month we happened to go for a team building activity and in the midst of all the fun and excitement of the girlfriend pecked me on the cheek and my jaw dropped I swear I froze for a few seconds. Wondered what it was but I brushed it off and I was that was It. 

Recently, my relationship has been abit rocky which is expected nothing too serious but we never discuss our issues with anyone outside of the two of us since we both consider that as micro cheating. fast forward to last Friday. I'm at the office and ai decided to go grab a coffee from  the coffee area. Guess Who I find there, yes my mentor's gf fixing her cup of coffee we engage in a short chit chat them as she turned to leave so I could fix mine she kissed me again only that this time it was straight on the lips I was astonished but at the same time it felt great so since there was noone else around I kissed her back and disengaged quickly and we both laughed said nothing and she walked away I'm still regretting doing that. I haven't said anything to anyone and we even met up with my mentor friend and the whole situation was weird.

But now I'm confused as to where we stand. We text pretty much every day, but we're only hung out once because of travelling/college commitments/life commitments. Though, when we did hang out, it lasted 5 hours... and we'd only intended to go for coffee. They're really good at making me laugh, like to tell me stories about their past/their family, show/tell me things they're interested in, have loaned me a book, and they ask questions about me/what I've been doing. I also suspect they treat me differently from their other friends, and once when I made a comment about them showing off, they said ""you only just realised?""

The reason I'm uncertain is because lately we've been texting less (though I also think they've been having a bit of a hard time), they haven't asked me if I'm single and when we did see each other they didn't try to touch me (and I'm unsure if that was being respectful/just wants to be friends/nervous).

I‚Äôll comment on what I think and give them a score at the end.

&nbsp;

**General Thoughts**
This is the first-ever filler case, and to be honest, I didn‚Äôt like it. A few things stood out as problematic:
- The two college guys, presumably in their early 20‚Äôs, flirting with 16-year-old high school girls felt off. While this was the '90s and might not have been as frowned upon back then, it still comes across as weird today.
- Then there‚Äôs Kogoro, who is usually a very overprotective dad, but here, he‚Äôs completely unbothered by the fact that his 16-year-old daughter is going to a party full of college students she doesn‚Äôt even know, that felt really out of character. And while this was at the beginning of the series, at this point in time in the manga it was already established that Kogoro was very protective.
- The entire premise surrounding Ran and the chocolate didn‚Äôt make sense.
   - Why was she making the chocolate in the first place? She was never interested in any of the guys at the party.
   - She says it‚Äôs for ""someone special,"" which could be Shinichi, but why bring it to the party in a fancy envelope then? She wasn‚Äôt expecting Shinichi to be there, so who was it actually for originally?
   - At the end, she wonders, ""What am I going to do with this chocolate?"" What was she planning to do with it originally?


Overall, the chocolate subplot felt like a cheap excuse to get Conan to follow her to the party.

&nbsp;

**The Party & Characters**
- The college students claim to be from the tennis club, but that never becomes relevant.


- They also say they‚Äôre medical students, yet when someone dies, they just stand there doing nothing. No one even tries to help or check what‚Äôs happening.


- The recurring ""joke"" about the big guy wanting to date Ran was mildly funny at first but quickly became repetitive and annoying.


- One of the few positives was the character design. The filler characters blended well into the world and had a very '90s feel. I didn‚Äôt love the designs, especially the mother‚Äôs, but the backgrounds and overall aesthetic were nice.

&nbsp;

**The Mystery & Case**
The mystery itself was terrible. The whole premise of poisoning coffee and then using an antidote in the cake is completely unrealistic. Poison doesn‚Äôt work like that, and the absorption rate varies and the exact amount of antidote needed is not the same for everyone. The plan had so many flaws:
- There was no way for the killer to know if someone else might not want to eat cake.
- The chocolate swap was absurdly easy to disprove, just check if the chocolate had teeth marks and saliva from the victim. They tested it for poison, so they should have noticed this.
- The guy who tried to poison the victim with cigarettes was obviously not the real culprit. The moment he said he poisoned the filter, the police should have realized the filter had no saliva from the victim and was literally cut.
- The only somewhat decent part was the motive‚Äîit made sense, but it wasn‚Äôt anything special.

&nbsp;

**Final Verdict**
This episode had a weird premise and a bad case. There were a few good aspects, but they were overshadowed by its flaws. I really had to force myself to finish it.

## Understanding the Enduring appeal of Wicker Outdoor Furniture

Wicker, as a material, has a rich history, dating back centuries. Traditionally crafted from natural materials like rattan, reed, and willow, modern wicker often utilizes synthetic resin, offering enhanced durability and weather resistance. This blend of classic aesthetics and contemporary innovation makes wicker outdoor furniture a popular choice for homeowners, businesses, and designers alike. But what exactly makes it so appealing?

*   **Aesthetic Versatility:** wicker seamlessly complements a wide range of design styles, from conventional and rustic to modern and coastal. Its natural texture and woven pattern add visual interest and create a sense of relaxed sophistication.
*   **Durability and Weather Resistance:** While traditional wicker could be susceptible to the elements, modern resin wicker furniture is designed to withstand harsh weather conditions. It's resistant to sun, rain, and even snow, making it a reliable choice for year-round outdoor use. All weather wicker furniture is particularly prized for its ability to endure even the most extreme climates.
*   **Comfort and Style:** Wicker furniture is not just about practicality; it's about creating a agreeable and inviting space.Paired with plush cushions and thoughtfully chosen accessories, wicker pieces provide a comfortable spot for relaxation and socializing.
*   **Lightweight and easy to Move:** Compared to heavier materials like wood or metal,wicker is relatively lightweight,making it easy to rearrange your outdoor space as needed.

## Navigating the Wicker Landscape: Types and Materials

The world of wicker outdoor furniture is diverse, offering a wide array of styles, materials, and construction methods. Understanding these differences is crucial for making an informed purchasing decision.

**Natural Wicker vs. Resin Wicker:**

*   **Natural Wicker:** Made from materials like rattan, reed, and bamboo, natural wicker offers a unique, organic look. However, it's less durable than resin wicker and requires more maintenance. It's best suited for covered patios or sunrooms where it's protected from the elements.
*   **Resin Wicker:** Also known as synthetic wicker or polyethylene (PE) wicker, this material is engineered to withstand outdoor conditions. It's UV resistant, water-resistant, and resistant to cracking, fading, and mildew. Resin wicker is the preferred choice for most outdoor applications.

**Frame Materials:** The frame underneath the wicker weave is just as crucial as the wicker itself.

*   **Aluminum Frames:** Aluminum is a lightweight,rust-resistant material that's ideal for outdoor furniture. Powder-coated aluminum frames offer additional protection against corrosion and scratching.
*   **steel Frames:** Steel is a strong and durable material, but it's susceptible to rust if not properly treated. Powder-coated steel frames are a good option,but require regular maintenance to prevent rust.

A little backstory on the relationship I had with my ex.
I was 17 he was 19. He came from a abusive family, I from a neglectful one.
He was made a narcassist by his family (yes I firmly believe this, no Im not a psychologist, maybe Im delusional).
He ruined me mentally, nothing was good enough. Cleaning, groceries, dinner, morning coffee, my school, my work and the worst part sex. Nothing I did was good enough and whenever I spoken up a door would end up with a new hole.
But we had really fun times as well. He worked hard, payed 90% of everything, planned al the fun stuff and also did some really nice things for me in general. 
There was drugs on the weekend and drinking during the week involved.
I did not use any drugs until a festival 3 years into the relationship and never was an addict, but I did start to down almost a bottle of wine every day during the week, just too numb the pain.
I broke free after 4 years of this mentally abusive relationship. 

(Probably) stupidly believe he is still a good person on the inside. And our conversation from 2 years back confirmed that a little. He said I was too nice and he should have been better. That he was dumb and acted stupid. 
No I never considder going back to him.
I spoke to his mom last weekend and she told me, he told her that I saved him in that time or else he would have had an OD in a ditch somewhere. 

So maybe it was the conversation I had with his mom.

My dream:
We were back into a relationship and I remember my mom showing my some houses and furniture and asked me what I liked and disliked. 
Then he and I went to a clothingshop, which also had a realter office (weird but okay). 
I was shopping for clothes and he was talking to the realter, I tried to get into the office but was not allowed. So I suspected he was buying or renting a house for us. 
So I chose some clothes and back home tried some on. 
He tried to come in the bathroom with our baby (what we have a baby?!?), but I had some special clothes he couldnt see yet. 
Then he spawnend in the bathroom, holding our baby (lol wtf, should have been my clue it was a dream).

Thats where it kind of ended I think. Its a little hazy.
But yeah totally weird dream, like he would be a Prince charming all of a sudden. I know he would never be that man, he is too ruined for that. 

I truly hope that someday I can actually wake up in a dream and do something.

At first, I passed him by, assuming he‚Äôd eventually leave, but he was there the next day, and the one after that. Something about him stayed with me, so one morning, I stopped, offering him a coffee from a nearby caf√©. He smiled, a tired but genuine smile, and thanked me.  

We exchanged brief greetings in the mornings after that, but I never asked his story‚Äîmaybe I was too afraid to pry. Then one day, he wasn‚Äôt there. Days turned into weeks, and I never saw him again.  

To this day, I wonder who he was, what brought him to that bench, and where he went. I don‚Äôt have answers, but I like to think that in some small way, our exchanges mattered to him, just as they did to me.",2,1741681255.0,stories,0,1.0,False
