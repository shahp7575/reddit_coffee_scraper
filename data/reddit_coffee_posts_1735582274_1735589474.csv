Looking for advice before heading to the store,"Hello all! To wrap up the end of the year and head into the new year with a clear head, I'm thinking about doing a 48-72hr water fast for some detox/autophagy/gut benefits. 

I currently do a 16-20 hr fast daily with sometimes reaching 30hrs unintentionally (busy schedule) and I'm usually fine. No preexisting conditions and I'm in decent shape. Only supplement I take is Vitamin D. 

From what I understand I should have a low/no carb unprocessed last meal, have a bunch of black coffee, tea and water on hand and also get some pink Himalayan salt and magnesium glycinate capsules for hydration. Does this sound correct? Or am I missing anything?  Do I need other vitamins and minerals? Any advice appreciated.

I recently restored a Gaggia Cubika from the dead. It wouldn't flow any water and it had a boiler valve blockage (which they all seem to suffer from), so I stripped it down and replaced it.  
  
It works perfectly now, producing amazing crema apart from the fact it goes absolutely crazy with the double spout handle (see image), causing coffee to erupt from the sides of the spout.  
  
If I remove the double part, the coffee squirts violently downwards from the tiny pin-prick in the middle of the portafilter.  
  
    
The top handle, is a bit more controlled, but funnily enough, coffee only flows from one side, which is odd.  
  
I am just using pre-ground coffee for testing the machine as its what I had kicking about.

Been having this work crush situation and it's taking up such a huge amount of my time just thinking about it! 

I met this guy (he works at the same company as me, but we never work together) at a festival that our company was sponsoring. I was upfront about the fact I was in a relationship at the time (no longer) but after several drinks he said to me ''You are very pretty if I can permit myself'' (sorry translating as this wasn't said in English). I said that was very kind of him to say and the conversation was very pleasant. 

  
Fast-forward over a year, I had been single for several months and saw him in a hallway at work (we had exchanged ''hi'' every time we saw each other until then), but this one time I decided to do something about it and messaged him on Microsoft teams. The conversation was instantly pleasant and he responded quickly. He offered to get coffee with me at the end of this conversation, to which I responded positively. 

We kept talking for several weeks, and eventually we realized we had been working on the same project and I jokingly said ''Oh how did we not notice each other'' and he replied ''who said I didn't notice you.. :) ''. There were several flirty but very appropriate messages, he put hearts on my messages and I did the same. 

He bailed a few times on coffee (once he said he was sick, and the other time he said he didn't make it into the office). At some point, I went on vacation and so wasn't able to contact him (I felt weird asking for his number on teams) but when I came back, he was in the office that day and waved at me, but didn't start a conversation or anything. I messaged him at the end of that week, and the last message we exchanged was him leaving me on read. 

He hasn't messaged since and neither have I. 

I don't know what I'm expecting here (this is so cringe lmao) but I guess wanted to share, see if anyone has any advice on my situation, or how to get over this elusive man. For context I am 26F and he is 28M.

She said she likes me and wanted to connect through friends. (for like a week or something)

Friends connected us on like coffee, they left and only me and her were there, leg contacts, flirting,...

I texted her for coffee tomorrow and she agreed, went well, bought her like candy she said she liked. She asked me on that coffee like were i in relationships before i said not (because i wasnt) and she was fascinated. Everything went well.

Texted on wednesday, of course flirting, like there is connections, i didnt invite her that day because didnt want to see here 3 days in row.

She said she is going to one club at thursday so i said like ill come and check on you (wanted to buy drink and like you know, man thing just to see her)

Everything went well, i was with my friends on celebration party i drank a bit and came to see her, we hugged for like 10 seconds, and i said like come to sledge like to get a drink and she said she doesnt want, and i said i wanna get something for myself.

She came with me and i said what you drinking she was like refusing and said ""I don't fall for those tricks"" i was confused i asked her like i dont know what you mean by that i told you i wasnt in relationships and she told me like its okay and something, never mind...

I was with her at standing table, at first like singing and my hand was by her waist, everything good, then she started removing my hand with her. I kinda got bored i thought i did something bad and she said like i gotta go, i said wait for me, and she said okay

We went out, we talked like good we even agreed for her to pay for tomorrow date hahaha (which i wouldnt give her), we got to her home.

Hugged, then i pulled her by waist into me, she didnt refuse, then we kissed good, and like cya tommorow.

Next day (Friday) she said ""we haven't known each other for a long time, we corresponded for 3 days, we saw each other for 2 days, I don't want to lie to myself that I didn't want to, I wanted to (think about the relationship) she says that she didn't like the thing about the waist and the kiss (I understand this about the waist, I saw it, I felt it , but I don't understand the kiss) and as an interruption.""

Today (4 days later) she blocked me on instagram.

My good friend that is good with girls said she got scared/plays hard to get/ or thinks i will use her for her body.

He told me to wait and see, but she blocked me.

Any advice? anything will help. I dont understand if she wants and gave me kiss why this at the end??",1,1735588989.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1hpvvlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1hpvvlw/my_ongoing_battle_with_afib/,My ongoing battle with AFIB,"I'm 32 (M) and I was diagnosed with AFIB on Father's Day of 2022. I woke up the previous morning feeling tired and just overall not right. I got checked out at ambulatory care, and they said I need to go to the emergency room immediately (the ambulatory care and the hospital are two different institutions). I got to call my Dad from the hospital and tell him the news, and I learned he also had the condition, but it happened to him in his 40s, so it seems I got it early. He had a quadruple bypass about 4-5 years ago, so while they had him cracked open, he got his ablation done.

The first 6-8 months of treatment for me was hell on earth, I got slapped with 4 medications (Losartan, Aspirin EC, Amlodipine, and Metoprolol) and I was having recurring nausea, fatigue, spiking heart rates (especially when trying to sleep), occasional shortness of breath, a recurring feeling of heartburn (which I'm getting better at recognizing it from actual heartburn), and tons of dizziness/light-headedness. Exercise, competitive gaming, and sex became difficult, as it would make the symptoms worse.

I kept on with a lowered quality of life, and eventually the symptoms got better(ish), though the condition would still come around to rear its ugly head if I ate the wrong things or had too much caffeine. Turns out 120MG of caffeine a day (a cup of coffee, give or take) is too much for my system to handle. I've also had to deal with the anxiety and uncertainty of, say, being able to take a trip to see family without the condition causing problems, or worrying about if X, Y, or Z is going to set it off, or the constant question of ""is my heart out of rhythm?"". There's even the looming dread of an increased stroke risk and whether or not my symptoms will return.

I started realizing the fuckery of the medical system as time went on, where my then heart doctor would go down the checklist of treatments (literally everything except an ablation) and would drop pill after pill on me. Eventually I went to get a second opinion from another heart doctor because I'm not happy with being on 4-5 medications, and I thought things were finally going to progress after getting a third 30-day Holter monitor test done (the first two were spotty because my skin had an awful reaction to it, turns out it was literally the shitty razor they used to shave my chest). But all I heard back was ""you just have episodes of high heart rate, keep taking your medication"". Literally nothing care wise is changing.

This new doctor has also told me several times that I don't have AFIB. I don't know if that means I don't have the underlying genetic issue that causes AFIB, or if it's just that my AFIB is ""under control"", but either way he's obviously not approving the ablation, which I had expressed interest in getting previously. I don't want to be on these medications for the rest of my life, and I don't want to have the recurring symptoms I've still been getting. I want to be able to tolerate more than a cup of coffee of caffeine, not have these random symptoms (especially at night since it wakes me up), the anxiety about it in general, feel confident that I won't have issues during strenuous physical activity, etc etc.

Any advice on what to do next? I currently go to a medical group for providers here in town, but there's a larger hospital that I could switch to (I used to work for them for 6 months, in fact). I'd think it might be worth trying them out to get a second opinion from a different institution, but it could just be more of the same.",3,1735588573.0,AFIB,1,1.0,False

Not that this should matter, but -we were in a marked and flashing school-zone crosswalk when a speeding boomer knocked the shit out of me and sent me flying.  I had two broken ankles and a hell of a case of road rash on my left side, blood everywhere and terrifying.

  
Cops came, ambulance came, friend's mom came.  My Nfather for once in his life was working and not picking up his phone for any of the adults calling him.

So, I refused transit to the hospital, and with my friend's mom's, we assistance made our way to my apartment which was covered in trash and overflowing ashtrays, etc.

  
Lots of time passes and friend's mom was not having it.  After about an hour of me bleeding on the couch and my right ankle more than doubling in size and still no answer from NDad, we pile into the station wagon and head to the ER.  There's a bunch of waiting to be admitted -no guardian present or reachable, but I'm finally put on a stretcher in a hallway where my pants are cut off and I'm left covered in a sheet waiting for imaging.

  
About an hour later, my Ndad barges past the waiting room and receptionist where he finds me, again, bleeding, broken ankles, and no-pants on a bed in the hallway and picks me up, throws me over his shoulder.  He's screaming that there is nothing wrong with me, no injuries, and how dare the hospital try to charge him for nothing more than a scratch.  An ER nurse and doctor argue that I need to be evaluated and treated but he's having none of that and parades me out to his car idling out front. IN MY UNDERPANTS.

  
Incredibly long story short: I couldn't walk well for at least 3 months; I had to shoplift bandages and surgical tape (and learn how the fuck to use them); I stole a pair of crutches from the nurse's office at school, I was constantly late to classes but fuck me no note so no excuses; None of adults in my life advocated on my behalf, and my right ankle still sucks 30 years later.

Cut to yesterday:

Boomer aunt -one of the above ""trusted adults"" had a whoopsie, broke her ankle while stumbling up in the morning to have a piss.  Insisted on an ambulance and not an Uber.  Refused to even try to walk on her good side.  I handled ALL of the response; called the ambulance, coordinated care, blah blah blah.  She told to the EMTs that her pain level was a 10!!!!

  
When she got home a few hours later after imaging and treatment and a pair of new crutches (no charge!), had the audacity to ask whether I'd ever used crutches and could I teach her how to use them.  When I replied with an abridged version of the story above, her response?? ""Oh, I didn't remember, that was such a long time ago, are you sure.""

  
Now she wants a sandwich with the crusts cut off and a Half-caff coffee and I'm not sure if I can keep my composure.

","TL;DR - my pregnant partner has been seeing an ex and not being honest about it

I'll start with the basic big facts - I was a virgin till i met my current partner, we were 25 and 18 when we met, we've been together for 13 years, our first child is due next spring, we've never had any real friction in our relationship till now.

About 3 months ago my partner reconciled with an ex fuck buddy of hers, they met at a local festival, they've been friends throughout our relationship and we actually met directly through him but we had moved away to a nearby city so we don't see him often. I know the details of their relationship because I inquired early on. Before I was in her life they were seemingly sexually quite close, sleeping over, sex in the kitchen during a party, etc. They broke it up because well, I don't really know, like I say I can only describe it as a fuck buddy situation, something I've never been part of.

When I say fuck buddy I want to be clear my wife was 16 or 17 at the time, had just moved out of her mums house and was having a fun time of it. She was sleeping with another guy at the time and she maintains to this day she was ""never in a relationship"" with him.

My wife and I have struggled with intimacy throughout her pregnancy, she had one big scare with a blood clot and otherwise feels uninterested. We've had sex 3 times since finding out in September, I've struggled with the lack of sex. It starts making your mind wonder.

About 2 months ago I found out she'd been round at his having a coffee while she was in the city doing grocery shopping, that in combination with seeing a text message on her phone to him saying ""have a nice day at work, xx"" kinda set me off. I told her I was really uncomfortable with her continuing a relationship with him. We had a big argument, I said to her I'm not going to hold her hostage, if she sees him out at the pub you don't have to flat out ignore him but just please don't meet him 1 on 1 in private as that feels very disrespectful.

About 2 weeks ago, my fiancee said she was going out to the shops, I could tell by her body language and her manner of speaking that something didn't seem quite right so I let it sit for 2 days, when she was out at work 2 days later, I checked her google timelines and saw she'd been at his address the week before and also that day she was out shopping.

I confronted her, I explained that this was a huge violation of respect, and that if it wasn't for the baby on the way that I would flat out end the relationship. She said she was sorry and it'll be a burden for the rest of her life and she won't see him again in any context if it affects me this much. I said I feel horrible restricting her like that but she can't fathom how different our sexual experiences are and the thought of even talking to someone you slept with, much less maintaining a civil platonic friendship is baffling to me.

Oh yeah the kicker, she got pregnant around about the same time she bumped into her fuck buddy. My wife and I have been trying for a baby for around 3 years with no success, and to be fair she has lost 4 stone this year. I want to believe that's what caused the fertility to kick in.

Obviously I want to take a paternity test as much as I trust my wife didn't have sex with me to get pregnant to another man, it's going to play on my mind. The whole thing has for the past 2 weeks. She's admitted that what she was doing was something of an emotional affair and has brought up my lack of attention towards her in recent months as part of her lack of fulfillment. My wife and I feel closer through this, its forced us to talk about some uncomfortable subjects but overall I feel deflated and empty.

  
I don't know if its her being naive, if it's me being strict due to my lack of sexual experience or if i was being too harsh in suggesting it would end the relationship. I love my fiancee dearly but I just don't understand how this is going to impact me long term? ",2,1735588153.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

With an unfortunately dramatic splash of crimson, Frank MacGreen found himself meeting the pavement in the most unceremonious way possible. As his life's essence pooled around him—staining the cold, indifferent concrete—his fading consciousness decided it was the perfect time for an unplanned trip down memory lane. Teetering on the edge of oblivion, he gazed into the abyss of whatever comes next. This was a near-death experience, minus the ""near.""

Childhood memories flooded back—an era of relentless curiosity and an endless barrage of questions that tested the patience of every adult within earshot. He remembered the thrill of cracking open rocks to reveal the glittering geodes within, each one a tiny treasure that made him feel like a pioneer unearthing hidden wonders. His father, a man with calloused hands and a hearty laugh, would join him in these geological escapades. Together, they'd spend hours in the backyard, the sun beating down as they sifted through dirt and stone. Their shared enthusiasm was infectious, a language only they spoke. Ironically, it was probably this very obsession with hidden treasures that planted the seeds for his later gambling compulsion.

Frank was the quintessential everyman, his ordinariness wrapped in a layer of endearing quirks. He had a knack for making people feel at ease, often diffusing tense situations with a well-timed joke or a sympathetic ear. Friends flocked to him with their problems, and he dispensed advice over cups of mediocre coffee in the lunch room. Despite navigating the emotional labyrinths of others, he kept his own heart at arm's length, wary of the pain that love often dragged along like unwanted luggage.

Not all memories were polished geodes and shared laughter, though. His mother's frequent relocations—always chasing some new beginning that never quite materialized—left him feeling unanchored. His parents' less-than-amicable separation played out like a drawn-out play with too many acts, each more exhausting than the last. The scarce contact with his father after the divorce left scars that no amount of rock collecting could heal. On top of that, he found himself thrust into the role of caretaker for his four younger siblings, each one looking to him with eyes that expected the world.

As Frank succumbed to a fit of coughing, his senses returned briefly to the present, focusing on two masked figures barking orders at a petrified cashier. Their voices seemed muffled, as though filtered through layers of wool. Frank yearned to retreat back into the sanctuary of his memories, to recapture fragments of joy amidst the surrounding chaos

High school emerged from the depths of his memory. A place where he felt like an alien amongst his own species. His social awkwardness was accentuated by his weight, and he often found himself ensnared by depression. As technology progressed, he found solace in the immersive realms of video games, his existence oscillating more in the digital sphere than reality. That was, until he met Claire Benter.

With her sun-kissed hair and sapphire eyes, Claire was an enigma that forever altered the trajectory of his life. Their initial encounter was endearingly clumsy, with Frank fumbling over his words, mistakenly introducing himself as Claire. Her laughter echoed in his mind as she played along with his blunder. This shared moment of laughter planted the seeds of a beautiful relationship, offering a glimpse of the happiness that awaited them.

His mind drifted away again, another memory surfaced—one far more recent and infinitely more precious.

It was a Saturday morning, the kind that seemed tailor-made for cartoons and sugary cereals. Sunlight filtered through the kitchen curtains, casting playful patterns on the tiled floor. The aroma of pancakes—his special banana chocolate chip recipe—wafted through the air, mingling with the fresh scent of brewing coffee.

""Daddy! Flip it higher!"" Lily's eyes sparkled with excitement as she perched on a stool next to the stove, her curly auburn hair held back by a headband adorned with cat ears.

Frank grinned, spatula in hand. ""You sure you're ready for the Triple Flip of Fantastic Fluffiness?"" he asked, adopting a mock-serious tone.

She giggled, clapping her hands. ""Yes! Yes! Do it!""

""Alright then, stand back. Safety first,"" as the loving father gently guides her a few inches away from it. With a dramatic flourish, he lifted the pan and tossed the pancake into the air. It somersaulted once, twice, three times before landing perfectly back in the pan.

""Ta-da!"" he proclaimed.

Lily erupted into applause. ""You're the best pancake flipper ever!""

""Well, I didn't earn the title 'Sir Flips-a-Lot' for nothing,"" he said, winking.

Just then, Claire walked in, her hair still tousled from sleep but eyes bright with amusement. She wore one of his old college T-shirts, sleeves rolled up, and a pair of fuzzy slippers that made a soft shuffling sound as she moved.

""Are my two favorite people causing kitchen chaos again?"" she teased, leaning against the doorway.

""Only the controlled kind,"" Frank replied, turning to give her a peck on the cheek. ""Breakfast is almost ready. Coffee's on the counter.""

She smiled, reaching up to smooth a stray lock of his hair. ""What would I do without you?""

""Probably starve,"" he quipped. ""Or worse, resort to instant oatmeal.""

She laughed, the sound like a melody that filled the room. ""Heaven forbid.""

They sat down at the table, a cozy wooden affair adorned with Lily's latest crayon masterpieces serving as placemats. As they dug into the pancakes, the room buzzed with easy conversation.

""Mommy, guess what?"" Lily said between mouthfuls.

""What is it, sweetie?"" Claire asked.

""Daddy said we might go to the park today and fly kites!""

Claire raised an eyebrow playfully. ""Oh, did he now?""

Frank held up his hands defensively. ""Guilty as charged. But only if someone finishes all her breakfast.""

Lily nodded vigorously, shoving another forkful into her mouth.

Claire chuckled. ""Well, in that case, I might tag along. Can't let you two have all the fun.""

""Actually,"" Frank began, dabbing his mouth with a napkin, ""I need to make a quick run to the store first. We're out of milk, and someone used the last of it on her cereal last night."" He gave Lily a teasing glance.

She grinned sheepishly. ""Cereal tastes better at night!""

""I'll second that,"" Claire agreed. ""Pick up some of that herbal tea I like? The one with the lavender and mint.""

""You got it,"" he said, standing up and collecting the plates. ""Anything else while I'm out? World peace? A unicorn?""

Claire pretended to think hard. ""Hmm, maybe just the tea. And a unicorn if they’re on sale.""

""Consider it done,"" he replied with a mock salute.

He grabbed his jacket from the back of a chair and headed toward the door. Lily scrambled down from her seat and ran over to him. ""Wait!""

He turned, kneeling down to her level. ""What's up, buttercup?""

She threw her tiny arms around his neck. ""Hug for good luck!""

His heart melted. ""Well, I can't refuse that."" He hugged her tightly, breathing in the sweet scent of strawberry shampoo. ""I'll be back before you know it.""

Claire joined them at the door, her eyes soft. ""Drive safe,"" she said, resting a hand on his shoulder.

He kissed her gently. ""Always do.""

As he stepped outside, the crisp morning air greeted him, carrying the distant sound of a lawnmower and the chirping of birds. The world seemed alive and vibrant, a mosaic of suburban tranquility. He took a deep breath, savoring the moment.

The drive to the store was accompanied by his favorite classic rock station, the familiar tunes prompting him to tap his fingers on the steering wheel. He considered taking a detour to the new bakery that had opened up—Claire had mentioned wanting to try their pastries.

""Why not?"" he thought. ""Brownie points never hurt.""

But first, the grocery store. He pulled into the parking lot, which was moderately busy with weekend shoppers. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed softly as he navigated the aisles. He tossed a gallon of milk into his basket, along with the herbal tea, and couldn't resist adding a box of Lily's beloved animal crackers.

As he approached the checkout, he noticed Mrs. Henderson from down the street scrutinizing a jar of pickles.

""Morning, Mrs. H,"" he said cheerfully.

She looked up, adjusting her glasses. ""Oh, Frank! Good to see you. How's Claire and that adorable daughter of yours?""

""Doing great. Keeping me on my toes as always,"" he replied.

""That's what family's for,"" she said with a wink. ""You take care now.""

""You too,"" he said, moving toward the registers.

He was unloading his basket when a sudden commotion caught his attention. Two men in dark hoodies burst into the store, faces obscured by masks.

""Everyone get down!"" one of them shouted, waving a handgun wildly.

Time seemed to slow. The casual chatter of the store dissolved into gasps and screams. Franks heart pounded in his chest, adrenaline surging through his veins.

He instinctively ducked behind a promotional display of canned beans, peering cautiously around the corner. The robbers were agitated, their movements jerky and unpredictable.

""Empty the registers!"" the second man yelled at the cashier, who stood frozen, her eyes wide with terror.

Franks mind raced. Should he stay hidden? Try to call for help? His phone was in his pocket, but the slightest movement might draw attention.

Just then, a child whimpered nearby—a little boy clutching a stuffed dinosaur, tears streaming down his face. His mother was trying to soothe him, but the robbers had noticed.

""Hey! Shut that kid up!"" the first man snapped, pointing the gun in their direction.

Something inside Frank snapped into focus. He couldn't stand by and watch innocent people get hurt. Summoning every ounce of courage, he slowly stood up, hands raised.

""Hey, take it easy,"" he called out, stepping into the open.

The robber swung around to face him. ""Who the hell are you?""

""Just a guy trying to buy some milk,"" Frank said evenly. ""Let's all stay calm.""

""Shut up and get on the ground!"" the man barked.

""Alright, no problem,"" he said, lowering himself to his knees. ""No one's doing anything stupid.""

The second robber was shoving cash into a backpack, casting nervous glances toward the entrance. ""We gotta hurry,"" he hissed.

Outside, the faint sound of sirens began to wail. The robbers grew more agitated.

""Move it!"" the first one shouted.

In their panic, chaos erupted. The first robber grabbed the cashier, pulling her over the counter. She screamed, struggling against his grip.

""Let her go!"" Frank shouted before he could stop himself.

""Mind your own business!"" the robber snarled, pointing the gun directly at Frank.

Time froze. In that split second, Frank saw everything with crystal clarity—the fear in the cashier's eyes, the trembling of the gunman's hand, the way the fluorescent lights flickered ever so slightly.

A deafening bang shattered the moment. Pain exploded in his chest, a searing heat that stole his breath. He stumbled backward, the world tilting crazily before he hit the floor.

The ceiling tiles above blurred and swirled. Sounds became distant echoes—a cacophony of screams, shouts, and the pounding of his own heartbeat. He tried to draw in air, but his lungs refused to cooperate.

""Claire... Lily..."" Their names were a silent prayer on his lips.

As his vision dimmed, memories cascaded over him like a waterfall. The first time he held Lily in his arms, her tiny fingers wrapping around his. Dancing with Claire in the living room, their favorite song playing as they laughed at their own clumsy steps. The way the afternoon sun painted her hair gold.

Regret and longing intertwined, a bittersweet tapestry of what was and what would never be. He wished for more time—a chance to say goodbye, to tell them one more time how much he loved them.

A gentle warmth enveloped him, the pain receding into a distant throb. He felt weightless, as if floating. The chaos of the store faded away, replaced by a profound silence.

""Is this it?"" he wondered. ""So soon?""

A wry smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. ""All this over a gallon of milk.""

As the darkness embraced him, a peculiar thought drifted through his mind. ""Maybe in the next life, I'll remember to buy extra.""

With that final, whimsical musing, he let go, surrendering to the unknown.",4,1735587925.0,HFY,5,1.0,False

“Tyler, we’re supposed to do a presentation at the all-hands in ten minutes,” Carol begins in her “professional” tone, “you’re totally screwing me over,” before ending barely below a shrill yell.

I’d honestly forgotten all about the presentation, and I mull over a response as navigate the line.  I have to pull into a narrow gap between two buildings, and I can’t stop my building unease.  Of course nothing bad will happen, but ever since that night I hate the idea of being stuck.  Imposing brick walls on either side prevent me from even opening my door, while the line of cars traps me in a slow forward crawl, “You can do it;” I say it almost as much to myself as to Carol, “I believe in you.”

I wait for a response, but none comes.  Somehow my phone no longer has any signal.  I bite my lip.  Despite how bright and sunny it is outside; my car is stuck in the shadows of this alley.  I’m alone in the dark, and closed in on all sides.  No matter what happens, the only open path is inching towards the inevitable pickup window.  Trapped in the normalcy of waiting for the slowest person in the world to decide what they want to order.  Suddenly, something flickers in my rearview mirror.  Looking closer, I see someone talking to a driver of a few cars back.  They’re tall and dressed in a baggy hoody.  This far away it’s hard to tell what they look like, or what they’re doing exactly.  Hugging?  Making out?  …Other?  I try to ignore it, and slowly roll a few feet closer to my goal.  

I flip through some radio stations, but my search is fruitless, so I sneak another peek into the rearview mirror.  The driver is sitting there at a dead stop, but the person they were talking to is wandering closer.  I *really* hope it isn’t someone begging for money or something, I always feel so uncomfortable in those kinds of situations, and who carries cash anymore anyways?  I instinctively check to make sure my window is rolled up, while the hooded figure knocks on another car.  I surreptitiously watch as a confused guy around my age rolls down his window.  My breath catches in my throat as the wanderer lunges forward and begins stabbing the driver.  His arm swings back and forth, raining heavy stabs into the driver’s chest.  Crimson arcs splatter across the windshield, while blood blossoming on his white button-up.  His feeble efforts to fight off the wanderer slowly die out. 

I’m glued to my rearview mirror as the wanderer steps up to the next car, the one right behind me.  I jump when someone honks their horn, and pull up to the drive-through speaker.  Lowering my window, I whisper, “I-I-I saw someone *murder*someone in the car behin-”

“I can’t hear you can you please speak up!”  The static blares back in response.

I spin around to see that the wanderer is still preoccupied with the victim behind me, and yell, “You have to help!  Somebody is attacking the drivers stu-”

“We don’t have time for pranks,” the speaker cuts out.  Shit.  I have to escape before he reaches me, but I’m stuck in this glacial line.  I immediately seize an attempt to get an inch closer to my exit, but something looms in my side mirror.  It’s him.  The Wanderer.  He’s drenched in filth.  Face and hands streaked in grime and blood.  His only discernable features are his cold, bulging green eyes.  Unblinking, devoid of purpose, and on the precipice of popping out of their sockets.  My heart freezes as I realize my window is still open, and… He passes by me without a glance.  

There’re only two cars between me, and the pick-up window.  In front of me is a large pickup truck.  Surprisingly, the Wanderer hops into the back.  Is he leaving?  No, he breaks through the rear cabin window, and muffled screaming follows.  I’m utterly trapped with only a few seconds before he’ll turn to my car.  I try opening my door and it crunches into the wall before I’d have the clearance to get an arm out.  Wait, the trunk!

I unbuckle my seatbelt and dive into the backseat.  I wrench down the rear-seat lever without checking to see if the Wanderer is already coming for me, and wiggle through the gap into the trunk.  Once the seats are pulled back up, I’m safe.  I let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding.  Shit, I forgot to unlock the trunk, and… the car shakes as it bumps into the truck in front of me.  Still, I can just wait things out, he’ll give up once he can’t find me.

The sound of glass shattering cuts through the air, and I struggle to be as still as possible.  The car jostles as someone climbs inside.  The engine roars to life and I feel the car begin moving.  Is he driving?  I slowly reach down and take my phone out of my pocket.  Still no signal.  Nothing can stop my rising panic.  What’s happening?  Why is this happening to me?  I’d write a description of the killer if I knew anything more than “tall with green eyes.”  The signal’s gotta come back eventually, right?  I stare at my phone trying to will the cellular bars back into existence.

I won't know the flight details until 3-5 days out but wanted to budget now so unfortunately I can't tell you the exact plane. I hope this is okay to post here.

* What is preferred? A $5 gift card for coffee or something useful like hand sanitizer and lotions?
* How many cabin crew (counting pilots) should I plan on? I'll be going MCO to ATL. I think I can budget for 10 each flight but I have seen 11 crew on some flights. I would feel mortified excluding someone.

# Who is this for?

* Budget-conscious buyers seeking beautiful diamonds without breaking the bank
* Those open to slightly warmer diamond colors
* Buyers who appreciate unique aesthetics in their jewelry

# Who is this not for?

* People seeking completely colorless diamonds
* Those highly sensitive to even slight color tints
* Buyers set on using white gold or platinum settings

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Prioritize cut quality: An excellent cut will maximize brilliance and help mask color.
2. Choose the right setting: Yellow or rose gold can complement the warm tint.
3. Consider round brilliant cuts: They tend to hide color better than other shapes.
4. Look for clarity grades between SI1 and VS1 for the best value.
5. Use high-quality imaging tools to inspect diamonds before purchasing.
6. Don't shy away from blue fluorescence, as it can make the diamond appear whiter.

# FAQ

Q: Will a K color diamond look yellow in an engagement ring?

A: The visibility of the tint depends on the setting. Yellow or rose gold can minimize it, while white metals may make it more noticeable.

Q: How does cut quality affect K color diamonds?

A: A well-cut diamond increases brilliance, which helps mask the body color and makes the stone appear whiter.

Q: Are K color diamonds a good value?

A: Yes, they offer significant savings compared to higher color grades while still providing beauty and sparkle when properly selected.

Q: How noticeable is the difference between J and K color diamonds?

A: The difference is subtle but can be noticeable to some. Factors like cut quality and setting can influence the perceived color.

Q: Can fluorescence improve the appearance of K color diamonds?

A: Blue fluorescence can sometimes make K color diamonds appear whiter, especially in natural light.

Remember, choosing a K color diamond can be a smart way to maximize your budget without sacrificing beauty. With the right setting and cut, you can have a stunning piece of jewelry that stands out for all the right reasons.

Hi, I am a 24 yr old male, and I was coming back from a trip where I made a stop at 5 in the morning to get some coffee. When I was coming out of the McDonald’s(It was also a truck stop), I was turning a right after a stop sign, and I was totally maintaining my right lane. Suddenly, i saw that a truck is in front of me. I tried to maneuver, although that truck was so close my drive side headlight portion collided with the front bumper of the truck and airbags opened. Nobody was injured tho. The police came and also said that truck was over the double yellow line and making the left turn way more earlier. Now, i am a student, and I didn’t have collison coverage. So, i will not get money from my insurance. But what are the chances that I get money from the truck”s insurance. I have extensive amount of pictures which clearly shows that two wheels of the truck was on the right lane and front was turned almost 40% to the right lane. 
Now, i am so puzzled coz my insurance adjuster didn’t call me yet. I have the number of the truck but don’t know which insurance they use! Please give me any suggestions. Thanks in advance !!",1,1735587601.0,caraccidents,0,1.0,False

I'll start with the basic big facts - I was a virgin till i met my current partner, we were 25 and 18 when we met, we've been together for 13 years, our first child is due next spring, we've never had any real friction in our relationship till now.

About 3 months ago my partner reconciled with an ex fuck buddy of hers, they met at a local festival, they've been friends throughout our relationship and we actually met directly through him but we had moved away to a nearby city so we don't see him often. I know the details of their relationship because I inquired early on. Before I was in her life they were seemingly sexually quite close, sleeping over, sex in the kitchen during a party, etc. They broke it up because well, I don't really know, like I say I can only describe it as a fuck buddy situation, something I've never been part of.

When I say fuck buddy I want to be clear my wife was 16 or 17 at the time, had just moved out of her mums house and was having a fun time of it. She was sleeping with another guy at the time and she maintains to this day she was ""never in a relationship"" with him.

My wife and I have struggled with intimacy throughout her pregnancy, she had one big scare with a blood clot and otherwise feels uninterested. We've had sex 3 times since finding out in September, I've struggled with the lack of sex. It starts making your mind wonder.

About 2 months ago I found out she'd been round at his having a coffee while she was in the city doing grocery shopping, that in combination with seeing a text message on her phone to him saying ""have a nice day at work, xx"" kinda set me off. I told her I was really uncomfortable with her continuing a relationship with him. We had a big argument, I said to her I'm not going to hold her hostage, if she sees him out at the pub you don't have to flat out ignore him but just please don't meet him 1 on 1 in private as that feels very disrespectful.

About 2 weeks ago, my fiancee said she was going out to the shops, I could tell by her body language and her manner of speaking that something didn't seem quite right so I let it sit for 2 days, when she was out at work 2 days later, I checked her google timelines and saw she'd been at his address the week before and also that day she was out shopping.

I confronted her, I explained that this was a huge violation of respect, and that if it wasn't for the baby on the way that I would flat out end the relationship. She said she was sorry and it'll be a burden for the rest of her life and she won't see him again in any context if it affects me this much. I said I feel horrible restricting her like that but she can't fathom how different our sexual experiences are and the thought of even talking to someone you slept with, much less maintaining a civil platonic friendship is baffling to me.

Oh yeah the kicker, she got pregnant around about the same time she bumped into her fuck buddy. My wife and I have been trying for a baby for around 3 years with no success, and to be fair she has lost 4 stone this year. I want to believe that's what caused the fertility to kick in.

Obviously I want to take a paternity test as much as I trust my wife didn't have sex with me to get pregnant to another man, it's going to play on my mind. The whole thing has for the past 2 weeks. She's admitted that what she was doing was something of an emotional affair and has brought up my lack of attention towards her in recent months as part of her lack of fulfillment. My wife and I feel closer through this, its forced us to talk about some uncomfortable subjects but overall I feel deflated and empty.

Am I going to be able to live with this lack of trust and get over it, how reasonable am I being in my response to my partners actions? This has consumed my thoughts for the past 2 weeks so I just need something to relate too. Thank you",15,1735587507.0,amiwrong,27,1.0,False

Also, throwaway account because this is super embarrassing and I don’t want it to be tracked back to my main. 

My wife (F46) and I (M48) were visiting family out of state for Thanksgiving. After the holiday, we traveled north to visit one of our kids (F21) who had just moved to the area for her first professional job since graduating. We arrived while she was still at work and planned on exploring the town while waiting for her to be ready to join us for dinner. We came across a weed shop (it’s recreationally legal in this state) and decided to pop in. 

A little back story here. My wife grew up in a very liberal family. Like, parents were at Woodstock kind of liberal. They were not shy about providing a safe space for their kids and their kids’ friends experimenting with weed, acid, mushrooms, etc. I, on the other hand, grew up in a very sheltered household as far as drinking and drugs went. My mom never drank in front of us as kids. I can only remember my dad having a beer in front of me once, and there was never even any talk about drugs. I didn’t have my first sip of alcohol until I was almost 30, and it’s only in the last year that I asked my wife to shepherd me into the world of THC/CBD. (It’s medically legal where we live, and we both have cards.) All of this to say, my wife is very experienced, and I am not.

So we enter this shop - it’s spacious and clean, and has a little bit of everything. We ask the clerk to show us some edibles. He looks confused and asks what we mean. “You know, edibles, like gummies, etc…” He says, “Oh, okay,” and explains he actually just moved here from overseas to help his brother run this shop and he’s never heard that term before. He also says he’s not a native English speaker. No worries, we figure maybe it’s also a regional difference. We say “ edible,” you say “ gummies?” Anyway, he points us to a glass display case with a lot of things in it: prerolls, loose leaf, gummies, dabs, mushrooms, etc. It’s a bit overwhelming to look through. While we’re browsing, he asks us if we want to try some vapes - they have these pen condoms, so sure, why not? We take a hit of three different sample vapes while looking through the case. We end up buying two vape pens and one package of two 8mg grape edibles. Since we already had the three hits from the sample pens, we decide to save everything else for later in the weekend.

The next day, we spend all day with our daughter, shopping for things to help decorate her first apartment. Around 5pm she decides she needs a break and wants to call her girlfriend, so my wife and I decide we’ll give her space for a couple of hours and head out on our own to explore the city until 7. The town is doing a Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony in the town square, and the shops are supposed to be open late as a result, so we should have plenty to keep us busy. This seems like a good time to take the edibles. 8mg is a typical dose for us and will give us just a little buzz while we walk around.

About 45 minutes into exploring is when I first start feeling the buzz, in an oddities market no less, surrounded by weird taxidermy, old medical photos, etc. We decide to get some food and choose this old-looking diner we saw earlier that looked like it would either be a hidden gem of a place or just a place that’s always been there. 

It was the latter, filled with older locals talking about local politics and trading in neighborly gossip. They kept coming and going, swapping tables with each other to form new groups. Townies being townies. It was quaint and fun to observe. The food itself was nothing to go back for, and the coffee was terrible, but it was cheap and it was fast. I’m pretty sure the only reason they could sustain those prices is because the ancient couple working the counter were the original owners, and it was a symbiotic relationship between business and proprietors - each continuing to exist only because of the existence of the other. I’m waxing poetic here, but these are the thoughts swirling through my head as we finish our meal. I was pretty sure my high was peaking in that moment. Usually, there’s a fast drop-off for me at that point, but now time is starting to slow down, and the conversation is sort of throbbing in my ears, and I keep getting surprised by the couple in the car outside who are staring at us only to realize it’s just our own reflection in the shop window that happens to line up perfectly with the windows of a car parked out front.

My wife is getting antsy - she likes to walk when stoned, and I can see on her face that she’s ready to leave the restaurant. I too have thought about leaving; however, I tell her I’m going to need a few more minutes because my legs don’t seem to work, and I’m pretty sure if I try to leave the booth, I’ll just fall over. I’ve tried moving them a couple of times, and they’re like dead weight. So we sit there some more, and my mind is kinda blank, and I’m just listening to the conversations going on around us, but they’re all swirling together, and it’s hard to focus on any one.

I realize at this point that I am really high. I’ve been that high only once before when we took 15mg instead of our usual 5-10mg. That had been a wild ride of wave after wave (coincidentally while we were at the beach), and I really wanted to get off that roller coaster after the first few peaks, but it kept going for a couple of hours. So I wasn’t looking forward to riding this out yet again.

You’re probably thinking at this point, “Oh, so the character he missed was probably a ‘1’ and he took 18mg instead of 8.” You’d be wrong.

My wife now realizes the state I’m in and is trying to talk me through it, as the wizened sage that she is. While she’s waiting me out, she decides to double-check the package because this is clearly not what we expected. 8mg, check. THC, check. Wait, why is there a “P” after the “THC”? She Googles what the “P” in “THCP” means. It stands for “phorol” as in “tetrahydrocannabiphorol”, a synthesized form of THC that is **33 times stronger than regular THC**. It is legal in most states and is typically *not* regulated. Doing the math, my wife realizes that we have both taken the equivalent of 264mg of THC. Yikes emoji.

Soon after reading this is when it catches up to her, and now I’m trying to talk her through it, existing roughly 15 minutes in her future, as best as I can given the circumstances.

Y’all, I wish this was the worst of it, but we’re just getting started.

We’re both in the thick of it. My wife manages to tap out a text message to our daughter that we’re in a bit of trouble and could she please come get us. I’m sitting there staring into space— the restaurant has gone quiet for me; none of the conversational din is making its way through anymore. I occasionally think to test my legs out to see if they’ll move, but so far they still feel numb. 

My wife is starting to overheat. She can’t figure out how to get out of her jacket, so she tries taking off her shoes. This is not going well. She ends up lying down on the bench, trying to kick her shoes off. Come to think of it, I’m hot too, but there’s no way I’m attempting to move.

A woman at the table next to us leans over and asks apologetically, “I’m sorry, I couldn’t help but notice. Is your wife alright?” I try to say, “she’s not feeling well.”  I think that’s what comes out. It seems to appease the woman, who goes back to her meal. 

We’ve drank all the water we had at the table, which is good because my wife now reaches for one of the cups and vomits in it. I’m panicking internally because there’s no way I can be of any help cleaning this up once it overflows. Somehow, I kid you not, she fills the one cup to the brim, stops, grabs the other cup, and starts again.

I have two thoughts: 

1. That’s gross; why is no one saying anything?
2. That’s really gross; I’ll hold this napkin up in front of the two cups to shield the other customers from the sight of two vomit-filled, clear plastic cups.

And this is how our daughter finds us: me holding a napkin in front of two cups of puke and my wife with her head on the bench and shoes halfway off. 

“Is that…,” she asks, eyeballing the cups. I manage a nod. 

She quietly disposes of the two cups - I don’t know where or how - and asks the staff for a glass of water. “Oh, you’re with them…” they say, she will later tell us.

She tells us it’s time to go. My legs still feel numb but like they might work if given no other option, so we follow her back to the apartment a couple of blocks away, like two big stoned ducks following a baby duckling. I remember being fascinated with stairs and air. My wife had her long-sleeve shirt on over her jacket and was very excited about everything. 

The next few time units are a blur. I know I end up in my daughter’s bathroom, but I have no idea for how long. All I can do is prop myself up on the sink counter. I wonder if this is what mental illness feels like and if I’m stuck here now. I keep moving my legs up and down to make sure they work. There’s a lot of vomiting and sweating. My wife has collapsed on the spare mattress in the bedroom that our daughter had set for us.

Eventually, I emerge and make it as far as the hallway between the bathroom and living room and decide that’s the best place for me to be, so I lie down there. I’m whimpering about how this can’t be real life and I’m worried that we’re being filmed and will be all over the internet the next day. Our daughter has had enough of this and decides to go for a walk. I remember her stepping around me in the hallway on her way out. It’s hilarious and tragic. I crawl to the couch next to the mattress. Neither of us can sleep. At some point, my wife gets up and vomits in the bathroom, brushes her teeth, and comes back to bed. She thinks an Altoid might help. I hear the crinkling of the cellophane and think it’s a rat come to chew her face off, so I jump off the couch and start blindly smacking the floor with a shoe. She manages to convince me it’s not a rat. I crawl back to the couch and pass out. 

The next morning is hell. We are supposed to go to a high school reunion that night, but we can barely function. We finally are up for leaving the house around noon. I’m absolutely paranoid that the townies from the diner will spot us and we’ll be run out of town. I can’t believe we aren’t in jail. I can’t believe only one person said anything to us that entire time in the diner, especially after the vomit incident. How did no one notice?? How were we not front-page news?? My wife has a photo of me from that afternoon, sitting at a booth waiting for food (at an entirely different restaurant, of course), and I don’t think I’ve ever seen myself looking so haggard. We eventually make our way back to my parents’ house, skipping the reunion entirely. We fly home the next day, but our weed hangover brain-fog lasts for days.

Tl;dr: We accidentally bought THCP edibles thinking they were THC; THCP is 33x more potent; we take the equivalent of 264mg of THC; we green out while in a diner in our daughter’s new hometown,",28,1735587135.0,tifu,7,0.94,False

dismantle like this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL5L-NOLYow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL5L-NOLYow)

you will need a small sized screwdriver to prode into it and push out dash and also a smaller sized phillips screwdriver and various sized allen wrenches. to take off the headlight just pull a bit on the edge of the connection port first so you dont forcefully rip it by pulling, just to be careful. once you remove the philip screws, you prode it like in the video and it pops off.

find the little device under the dash, stuff it with a pinch of a cotton ball and a paperclip or something like a needle. careful not to slip and damage the board the speaker is super small for the amount of noise it makes. if you do it too harsh you will slip and possibly damage the circuit board. put it on top the hole of the speaker and kinda tug into the edges until filled.

replug everything to test the muffled sound before putting everything back together completely. in my case plugging it to the charger causes my beeping. the muffled sound is very tolerable and i wont have issues with my roommates or charging at coffee store lol. thank you to the guy who commented this in another post.",1,1735587069.0,ninebot,2,1.0,False

I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression for years, since losing my mom at age 10 & have also been diagnosed with PTSD. I was put on Prozac back in 2010 & stopped after a month bc it made me feel worse. 

I’ve said all that to give an idea of my emotional health. My oldest son is 17 & I have a 3yr old, 20 mo old & 1 mo old. 
Right after finding out I was pregnant w my 1 mo old, things at home began going downhill. So many problems left & right.. I had to deal with a lot on my own & due to this, I seeked help. I was 7 mo pregnant when I was prescribed Zoloft & I would wake up anxious and nauseated. When I ran out, I didn’t go back for more.

One thing though, no matter how bad my anxiety & depression got, I always had things to look forward to.. a good movie/show, cuddling with my babies, a nice steak or sweet snack, music I love..  something as simple as looking at stuff in Amazon/walmart & adding it to my saved list or sitting in the bathroom while watching IG reels brought me a sense of pleasure. And that pleasure provided me some relief from my anxiety & depression, I just wasn’t aware until now. 

Last Sunday, my kids came down with the flu and then I did. On top of it, we have until 01/09 to come up with $2k or move out. Sleep deprivation has taken over & breastfeeding makes me feel “off”.. I think I finally broke & have fully lost interest in things. Drinking water gives me anxiety.. I love coffee but I’m so fearful of it now. I always smoked THC to ease the anxiety but the thought of smoking now gives me more anxiety. 

Has anyone else felt this way? What helped? I need to feel excited and happy about life with my babies, again 💔 This is destroying me. My husband has been so patient but I want to be there for him too. ",1,1735586762.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False

Premise: 

\-The contestants are CEOs that are either allegedly or anonymously nominated by their employees that had grievances/laid off/fired. The organizer is probably headed by a somewhat extreme Robin Hood figure

\-Rather than playing children games, the death games are corporate and generally adulting themed, to forcibly put the rich contestants into the shoes of the people that worked for them.... Death cubicles, timed powerpoint presentations, zoom meetings, you name it.

\-Also during lunch time the food is either pantry coffee or pizza, because you know, that is what they feed their poor hardworking, underpaid employees!

\-The winner of the game does not win anything but simply stripped of their wealth and then has to live as a middle-class citizen like the rest of the world, because life is the ultimate prize, something they can never win back with any money.

I wasn't going to make another post, but I don't know what else to do. I have no one else I can tell these things without being called crazy, or god forbid, the people close to me think I am just making things up. My life continues to go downhill. I have been having nightmares for a few days now in which I see the creature that was protecting the barn. In these interludes, the twisted face hovered just inches above mine while I lay paralyzed, my heart beating hard in my throat. I wake up sweating and hyperventilating, my fingers trembling.

I usually can't go back to sleep afterward, and have stopped trying, instead brewing a pot of coffee and getting my day started. To be fair, the extra time has been nice and given me the opportunity to get my patry and refrigerator restocked. In the last few days, however, the lack of sleep was catching up to me. It was starting to effect my performance at work.I made my first major mistake last week. I had apparently forgotten to put out the wet floor sign, and one of my co-workers slipped. Fortunately, they weren't seriously hurt.

I still got chewed out, though. I also would have been liable if the injury would have been more serious. That didn't seem to sink in however because I screwed up again yesterday, and this time a rack of product was destroyed. Again, no one was hurt. I was sitting at the table after one of the nightly episodes, listening to the sound of the machine on the countertop, the aroma of the caffeinated water reaching my nose, lifting some of the fog from my brain. The first cup helped to open my eyes a little further.

I had a few errands to run before I clocked in. I did what needed to be done, and went out for a late breakfast, tucking myself into the back corner of the diner as far from other people as I could. I didn't even really want to interact with the hostess or server though I had to. I barely tasted my food as I chewed and swallowed it. Things were starting to seem very strange to me, almost surreal, no matter how mundane the scene in front of me was. I blame it on sleep deprivation, because even as I type this I am unsure if I am dreaming. Maybe I am just a little drunk.

On top of my personal life crumbling around me, I have been getting the feeling that I am being watched. It started a few days ago, while I was outside, cleaning out the gutters during a brief respite from the rain. I glanced around from my vantage point on the ladder, but saw nothing suspicious, just people going about their daily lives. I walked back inside, but the feeling didn't subside. I felt uncomfortable and unsafe in my own home until I left for work. I barely remember making it through my shift, my brain fuzzy and buzzing from lack of sleep and paranoia.

As soon as I got home, I crawled into the bottle, barely paying attention to the movie I had turned on. I glanced around, lamenting the lack of decorations that I had put up even though at this point it was only a few days before Christmas. The feeling didn't motivate me to do anything more than drink more. I passed out on the couch, and wasn't quite awake when my brain registered the sound of something scraping over the side of my apartment. I sat up quickly, my head spinning quickly from the alcohol still circulating my bloodstream.

I glanced toward the front door, holding my breath and half expecting the knob to begin to turn. It didn't and after a while, my heartbeat slowed and my brain began to rationalize things. I started to feel silly, and as I stood, I glanced toward the window. I saw a flicker of movement there, and was positive I hadn't imagined it, and against every instinct, I moved in that direction. When I looked through the curtains, I saw nothing unusual. I again mentally chastised myself. I was allowing my mind to play tricks on me, and I was embarrassed even though I was alone.

I stumbled my way to the bed and collapsed into it, letting my eyes close again. This time it was dreams of the twisted, shadowy figure with the glowing eyes that woke me. This time I was far more clear headed and the sun was beginning to come up. I shaved and showered, then got dressed. I went out to send off some bill payments, and stopped at a small coffee shop on a whim. I ordered my drink and turned to walk to a table, bumping into another patron.

“I'm sorry. Excuse me.” I proclaimed meekly.

“It's okay.” the stranger said, and when I looked up and met his eyes, I was immediately flushed.

This man was beautiful. He had clear skin and large brown eyes situated above a set of cupid-bow lips. I stammered and moved out of his way, waiting for the barista to call my name. He stranger I had bumped into approached me after a few minutes. I felt myself flush again. He didn't say anything, and even smiled when the young girl behind the counter called my name. I noticed because I couldn't stop peeking at him from the corner of my eye. I went to work without returning home and found myself thinking about the encounter throughout the day.

As if I had manifested him, the man with the brown eyes came to my place of work.

“Hello again.” he said with a slight smile when our eyes met.

“How are you?” I replied, still slightly distracted with what I was doing.

“Doing fine, and yourself?” the stranger prodded, lingering near me.

“Living the dream.” I joked, though I began to wonder if the man had followed me here, after seeing my name tag at the coffee shop.

The paranoia I had been feeling for the past few days re-emerged suddenly and I felt a panic attack coming on. I didn't even excuse myself, just walked away quickly, feet carrying me into the break room. I closed the door behind me and sat on the couch, trying not to give in to the lightheaded feeling that was coming over me. I lost that battle, lost in blackness, and being stalked by those glowing eyes and when I came to, there were a few concerned faces hovering over me, one of them belonging to my boss.

“Are you okay?” Scott asked, the concern still evident in his face.

“I think so, yeah.” I tried to assure him, but to be honest, I still felt a little bit off.

“We called the ambulance. I need you to stay put until they get here.” he told me.

“Whatever you say.” I agreed. I didn't feel like standing anyway.

The man and woman in the uniform arrived and gave me a quick but thorough once over, giving me the all clear to go back to work, though I was told to go the hospital at the first sign of a headache as I had apparently hit my head on the floor. I flt the knot on the back of my scalp, and it was still tender, but at least it didn't seem to have split. My hair wasn't matted and I didn't feel a wound in my gentle prodding. I eventually made my way back out to the floor, and to my relief, the stranger was gone. I went about the rest of the day without incident.

Before I left, Scott caught up with me.

“I need to see you in my office for a minute.” he said.

I nodded and followed him. When we got inside, he motioned for the chair almost directly in front of me. I sat down and he let out a long breath that wasn't quite a sigh.

“I think you need to take some time off. Unfortunately we can't pay you, but we have already started an unemployment claim for you.” he told me in his gentlest voice.

I didn't argue, I just stood up and left. I went home and immediately poured myself a drink. I didn't eat anything that night. Christmas came and went, but I was just going through the motions. My mother and father tried to make me laugh, but it didn't work. I felt myself slipping further into despair. I had lost everything, and even my sleep was being taken from me by the terrible dreams I was having nightly. I started drinking as soon as I got home once again. After a few drinks, I began to feel hot, the air in my apartment drier than it should have been.

I walked through the front door and outside, letting the cool night air sink through my somewhat damp clothing, the moisture on my skin almost immediately turning ice cold. My breath hung in front of my lips in a faint vapor cloud, but it all felt so good. The frigid air seemed to soothe the heat inside me, and I was glad for that. I was turning to walk back inside when I saw a figure standing beneath a streetlight. To my relief, they were normally proportioned, but seemed to be waring dark clothing.

'Probably just one of the neighbors.' I thought as I walked back into my home.

I tried to cling to that thought, but before long, I found myself walking around, checking the window locks and closing the blinds. The paranoid feeling that had overwhelmed me earlier started to return. Before I could spiral completely out of control I used my phone to look for things to help anxiety. One of the first results was to take a walk. I decided that I would do just that, putting on a heavy jacket and gloves before I left this time. I pulled the hood up over my head and glanced both ways down the street.

This time I was the only person outside. I started walking toward a gas station a few blocks away. When I got there, I went inside, and started moving toward the cooler to claim a bottle of iced tea, and froze when I saw the stranger from the coffee shop standing in one of the aisles. I should have left, but I couldn't get my feet to move. He looked my way.

“Fancy meeting you here.” the stranger said, his lips curling up in a smile.

“Yeah, hi.” I replied without thinking, though the words were awkward and clipped.

“I feel like I should introduce myself at this point.” the handsome man joked, trying to break the tension that had formed in the room.

“If you insist.” I said in return, the creepy feeling once again fading as he moved around the small table with discounted candy sitting on top of it. We shook hands and once again when our eyes met, I felt my face flush.

“My name's Jeff.” he said, his smile growing a bit when he noticed that I was blushing.

I told him my name as well, and we both paid for our items and we left the store together. Even though it was late, I was happy for the company.

“Do you want to walk me home?” I asked, without intending to. The words fell out of my mouth before the thought was complete in my brain.

“How far is it?” he enquired with a quick glance at the watch on his wrist.

“A few blocks.” I told him, and he nodded.

When we got to the apartment complex, he accompanied me to my door.

“Come in.” I invited, hoping that having someone around would quell my nightmares.

When we got into the place, I went straight to the linen closet and got him a blanket and pillow, placing those on the couch. He smiled and I felt a flutter of butterflies in my stomach. He patted the sofa next to himself, and I felt my cheeks grow hot again as I moved to sit next to him.

“I know it's late, or well, early in the morning, but do you think we could have one drink?” Jeff requested.

I shrugged, and retorted, “I guess there's no harm in it. You like whiskey?”

“It'll do.” he nodded.

I started to stand to go get the bottle but he insisted on doing it for me. A little bit of my earlier paranoia returned and so I followed him, pointing to the cupboard where the bottle was and then the shot glasses. He poured a measure of the brown liquor into one of the small glasses for each of us. I made sure to watch his hands carefully, but as far as I could tell, he hadn't slipped me anything. There was no strange cloudiness or bubbles in the whiskey, so I drank it. Then we had another. Then another. Before I really comprehended what was happening we were in bed together. After we finished and got cleaned up, I laid next to Jeff, and as I drifted to sleep, I thought I saw his eyes glowing.

I woke up long after noon had passed. I was alone. I sat up slowly, and looked around, my brain dragging a little bit. There was no sign that Jeff had been there at all. The blanket and pillow I had placed on the couch was back in the linen closet, and there was one shot glass sitting in the dish drainer. I shook my head and moved to the bathroom, taking a long shower. I toweled off and got dressed, then drove to the grocery store. I began to feel as if I was being watched again. I developed tunnel vision and my head spun.

I tried to hurry toward the bathroom, but didn't make it, as far as I know. I woke up in the back of an ambulance, and as the doors closed, I swore I saw Jeff's face in the crowd of concerned faces of the employees and other customers. His lips were turned up in a familiar smile and his usually brown eyes seemed to smolder with amber light. When I got to the hospital, I was diagnosed with a severe concussion and released after a few hours. I tried to call Terry to tell him about my fainting spells, but he didn't answer.

I woke a couple of days ago to knocking at my door. A man in a delivery uniform stood there, and handed me a small flower arrangement. The small card said get well soon but there was no sender. That's when I saw Jeff walking around the corner away from my house. I didn't chase him, but I am going to confront him the next time we meet.",0,1735586473.0,nosleep,0,0.33,False
1hpv1fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/StainedGlass/comments/1hpv1fz/latest_piece_with_backstory_what_happened_to/,latest piece with backstory   (? what happened to original post?),"Hope you all like this piece which I made for myself.   (I finally got around to making something for ME).  I have a 3’ marine reef tank and the piece will be put up on the window to right of it.  The fish are very close in appearance to those in my tank.  Size is 18” x 24” unframed.  25 unique colors and about 250 pieces.

Backstory……. I drew up my two template copies on kraft paper.  Having just finished cutting the pieces for the sandbed, I spilled a full Yeti cup of HOT coffee on project and wound up dissolving/destroying the templates.  I saved the fish and constructed them, laying them out on a new piece of kraft paper along with the sandbed that I had tinned together.  (I foiled the fish sections and held them in plate on painters tape until I could tack solder them.  Push pins alone would not hold the small curved pieces in place.  The painters tape worked REALLY well).  I then cut the seaweed and water pieces “free form” around them.  (UyVey! But it worked).  I’m happy with the result.

But wait, it gets better.  Even using scrap/odd sized pieces from my light blue bin I basically ran out of large enough blue water rolled glass.  It was a discontinued color from Oceanside glass and they did not have any more in the warehouse.  After many choice words shouted at the universe, and checking for a place to get another (10x16) sheet, I found an identical texture/color at Hobby Lobby (12x12).  Their glass is thinner, sort of like window glass, but at this point beggers couldn’t be choosers.  It worked and I was able to finish my piece.  (Solder lines conceal the different glass thicknesses well).  Color matches 99%+.

I plan on buying a frame from “NorthernHardwoodFrames.com”  (2-18” + 2-24” and putting it together).  The pieces come mitered, predrilled and with plugs to cover up the screws.  Not yet sure if I will paint frame white or a deep bronze like the patina.  Lastly, I will add some acrylic embellishments for fish eyes, too small for me to cut into the glass, and for some white polyps on the corals.

Last comment….. I live in the Richmond, VA area and there are NO stained glass suppliers in my drivable area.  COVID killed all six.  There are a few galleries but they exist soley for commission work and repairs. I need to carefully figure out colors and amount of glass to buy online to make the most out of the added cost for shipping. That’s why I had to resort to HL for my last piece of glass.

\-Completely unaware that Marcus, her boss in the Enforcers, is working for crime boss Silco. Even being told that Enforcers have been killing Zaunites on Silco's command doesn't make her consider that Marcus might not be trustworthy. Only a completely unexpected intervention from Jinx prevents her and Ekko from ending up dead.

\-Falls hook, line, and sinker for Ambessa's false flag attack at the memorial. She seemingly never figures out what happened, instead spending months persecuting Zaun for it.

\-Literally sleeps with a Noxian spy for months and doesn't realize anything's amiss until she's at gunpoint.

\-Is right there when Vi tells Silco, “What have you done with my sister?"" and he replies, “I freed her. Candidly I thought you were the prize of your secondhand family, but Jinx, she’s more than I ever could have imagined.” Less than an hour later, when she sees Vi and Jinx hugging, her response is a shocked, ""Your sister is Jinx?""

\-Had one key insight in her season one investigation: seeing Jinx's unmistakable graffiti at both the Hexgate airship and the Progress Day bombing and concluding there was a relationship, which is a connection an eight year old could come up with. She incorrectly thought both events were part of a conspiracy by ""a single mind behind the undercity's violence"" rather than the results of multiple actors with conflicting motives. From that point on, her only contribution is to tag along while Vi solves the case for her.

Conclusion: if you ignore the League of Legends lore and only focus on what happens in Arcane, the only job within the police Caitlyn is qualified for is to fetch coffee for the detectives who actually have working frontal lobes.",0,1735586362.0,arcane,9,0.25,False

Although I don't think I'm an alcoholic, I know I drink too much more often than I wish I did and I'm definitely in need of a reset. 

It was much easier when there wasn't much going on socially and I didn't have to explain why I wasn't drinking to anyone. I have a little bit of social anxiety and definitely enjoy drinking to help with that. Also everyone knows I love my wine, and in trying to be a good host everyone will ask me multiple times if they can get me a drink. 

Another hard part of not drinking alcohol is that I just don't really like any non-alcoholic beverages other than water. I'm not into coffee, tea, juice, soda, or anything with carbonation. So if I've got my water bottle with me there's really nothing someone trying to be a ""good host"" can get for me and it's a bit awkward. I feel like telling people I'm taking a break from drinking is like admitting I have a problem which I don't want to do. There've been days with my husband's family where I didn't want to drink either because I'd had too much the night before, or because I was trying to be more mindful of limiting my drinking days per week, and it's been hard to say no, particularly since they will ask if they can get me wine many times and I have to keep saying no.

1hpuztt,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1hpuztt/best_adhdfriendly_purchases_of_2024/,Best ADHD-friendly purchases of 2024,"What are some of the best things you’ve purchased this year?

For me:

1. Clothing drying rack - gone are the days I would lay my clothes out on any flat surface or hanging from closet doors to dry

2. Erasable pens - I hate pencils but also constantly make errors when writing/journaling that trigger my perfectionism/make me want to throw away entire notebooks

3. Tiny garbage cans - instead of thinking I’ll just make sure to throw my trash away instead of leaving it crumbled on my nightstand and desk (I never managed this), I bought two tiny trash cans for my bedside and desk, even though they are in the same room. No more garbage on the floor or on my nightstand!

4. Extra laundry baskets - I thought that having only two laundry baskets would force me to put my clothes away faster, but instead, I just piled clothes on my chairs. Having four baskets is a game changer because now I have one exclusively for clothes I wear once.

5. See through containers. I now have a clear bag for my medications, and two small clear drawers for under my nightstand. I can see everything I need and it helps me take my meds on time.

6. Apple Watch - this one was expensive and I waited years because I didn’t think it was worth the money. It’s still expensive but in my opinion it’s completely worth it. I have reminders for all of my different meds, a reminder for my bedtime and when to turn off screens, and I never miss calls anymore! This was a huge problem because I would set my phone down and forget to ever check it. 

7. Tiny laundry bags. I spent years wondering why my bras and underwear were always getting worn out so fast, but I never thought of the obvious! Like, yeah, they do make tiny mesh bags to protect delicate clothes.

8. Color grabber sheets - I also spent forever hoping my clothes wouldn’t bleed into each other, and being disappointed when my gray towels were now purple (although, I like them better now) and my white shirts now looked like they were tie-dyed blue. They make sheets that you can throw in the washer and they suck up all the color so this doesn’t happen.

9. Second laundry hamper for towels - again, why did I think it made sense to have everything in one hamper???

10. A basic coffee maker I actually like. I bought a coffee maker a year or two ago and I hated it but thought I had to use it because I spent a lot of money on it. I never used it and just spent money buying coffee from Starbucks/local coffee shops. I finally caved and bought a regular coffee maker from Costco (not a fancy, one cup hot or iced coffee maker) and I use it every day and now only go out to get coffee as a treat.

Anyway, I’m wondering what you all have purchased this year that has helped your ADHD? ",6,1735586298.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

I am sure glad I am off work today because I am quite busy at my other job, this. I have compiled all the relevant data for this upcoming event and will be posting it here for your review and to serve as a guide. I will also be performing a standard space weather update since I have not done so in a week. I don't know about you, but I am very excited. It has been a few months since our last real geomagnetic storm and to be 100% clear, this NYE event is not exactly a sure thing in its progression, duration, or intensity. You may recall my words about the density being suspect when comparing the coronagraphs to the models. This was evident to me visually. The CME scorecard is also hedging a bit on the same grounds as I will show you. However, whenever there are multiple CMEs such as the case right now, the forecasts become messy. The models struggle with multiple impacts for several reasons. The main reason is that we do not have eyes in the solar wind while these CMEs are in transit. We will not know anything firm about them until they arrive at our satellites positioned at the L1 point. So not only do we not know how they may have combined, interacted, or their true metrics, we do not know what the embedded magnetic field will be like both in intensity as well as orientation. As a result, the range of outcomes is wider than it would be if there was only one CME in transit. You know how the saying does. What happens in the solar wind...stays in the solar wind. Nevertheless, of all the possibilities I am considering, an extreme damaging event is not one of them, so put that fear to rest. I have compared the current sequence with other noteworthy sequences this year and I can tell you that visually they do not present the same. With all that said, we still stand poised to expect no less than 3 impacts with individual Kp ranges of Kp4-Kp8 throughout the days of 12/31-1/1 if the modeled arrival times are somewhat accurate, which is no guarantee by any means. Significant geomagnetic storms are quite a bit more rare in the months of December and January compared to other periods, but the stage is set to experience a pretty good one if everything breaks right. So let's get into the data. First I am going to give you a synopsis on current conditions and then we will talk about the storm.

**Summary**

Flaring continues today, but at slightly lower levels than over the weekend. Some active regions are exhibiting some decay and we have probably topped out on the F10.7 for this episode. However, a decent M5 flare went off as I type this. Regardless, the flare chances are elevated for the foreseeable future because despite fluctuations in size and complexity, the regions are active and have transitioned into a more eruptive state as evidenced by the multiple CMEs headed our way. I do note that throughout this entire sequence of events, duration has still been lacking and the coronagraph signatures are faint. This is why I termed this period ""active conditions -lite"" because the trend has not led to duration or dense ejecta. Officially there is a 30% chance for more X-Class flaring but these probabilities are more reactive in nature than anything. I include the graph above to demonstrate the trends and how several agencies are viewing them.

In addition to the solar flaring, we have two substantial coronal holes situated on opposite hemispheres in close proximity. They are in good position to be geoeffective and provide a Coronal Hole - High Speed Stream and associated phenomena. I have include a 195A image with the coronal holes circled in blue which appear as dark patches. We can likely expect influence from them towards the weekend and beyond. Watch for an uptick in seismicity during that period. The evidence continues to mount for coronal holes and their associated effects having a significant effect on seismic activity which ties in nicely to the recent discovery of EM waves being detected around 1 minute before the 1/3/2023 Nepal M6.4 quake as well as the known electromagnetic precursors which appear in the days and weeks before a major earthquake. Very fascinating and compelling stuff.

**Summary**

Low energy protons are exhibiting a spike around 06:00 and have mostly been steadily rising. We often see spikes like this prior to a CME arrival. Solar wind conditions are a bit unsettled as well with minor enhancement over the period as I will show you below. It is likely the KeV protons will continue their trend as the CMEs arrive. MeV high energy protons are not quite at background levels but they have been elevated for over a week now, but not at S1 radiation storm levels. The duration is noteworthy but is of little consequence at these levels. The MeV proton count was elevated prior to the weekends events and is not related, although you can see a small rebound right at the 12/30 mark indicating there may be some influence. NOAA puts the chances at an S1 radiation storm or greater at 15-20% for the next 3 days including today. That could change in a heartbeat if these big active regions fire a big flare as they cross the limb. The limb is among the most geoeffective locations for a proton event to occur because of the parker spiral and magnetic field lines. Will be keeping an eye on it.

**Summary**

The solar wind is just a bit unsettled with a detectable disturbance around 06:00 which coincides with the KeV proton spike. Overall this has not manifested into geomagnetic unrest because the disturbance was minor but when the Bz (red line, highlighted purple when south-) went south-, the indexes rose ever so slightly. We can expect the solar wind to get interesting in the next 24-48 hours but for now its mostly calm. As we get into the CME arrivals, the most important metric to pay attention to is that red line. It is the gatekeeper metric. When it goes south-, the earths magnetic field couples efficiently with the interplanetary magnetic field and any disturbance present. When it is north+, the earths magnetic field mostly deflects the CME. The times around the equinoxes are significantly more favorable for a south- Bz as part of the Russell McPherron Effect due to the orientation of sun and earth at those times. The Bz will go a very long way in determining how effective the incoming CMEs are at generating geomagnetic unrest and resulting aurora.

**-END SPACE WEATHER UPDATE-**

**GEOMAGNETIC STORM WATCH (G3/Kp7 Strong)**

As noted, we have multiple impacts headed our way and several of them have been modeled to be very geoeffectively with the two most significant CMEs carrying a 95-98% confidence of impact according to HUXt. Because of time and video limits, I am only going to to include the NOAA ENLIL spiral and HUXt because they model the situation overall instead of one at a time like ZEUS and NASA. I encourage you to check those out as well and they have been factored into my analysis even if they are not present to view in this update. I am going to start with the coronagraph showing all events.

**Summary**

You can certainly tell the sun was active when viewing this capture with multiple partial halo signatures where the ejecta extends to both hemispheres of the sun or where ejecta is visible around the disk following an event. The density is suspect as mentioned, but there is quite a bit of gas in the tank possibly due to the volume of eruptions, albeit modest ones. Since I am at the video limit, I have attached the captures of solar activity in SUVI Angstrom views of all activity for your viewing pleasure at the links below.

**NOAA ENLIL**

https://reddit.com/link/1hpuxsr/video/vyqrzvj661ae1/player

**NOAA Analysis**

The NOAA modeling is quite robust with two significant peaks with density modeled north of 30 p/cm3 which is moderately high and solar wind velocity around 500-700 km/s. Their resulting forecast is a G3 geomagnetic storm watch and while there is room for an overperformance owing to the multiple impacts, I am hedging ever so slightly, unable to ignore what my eyes tell me from the coronagraphs. However, any density deficiency could be made up by the multiple impacts and the degree of interaction of the effect of consecutive impacts. One scenario is that they arrive closer together than expected and packs a bigger punch up front or they could arrive a bit spaced apart and lead to a longer duration storm with less punch up front. Again, Bz/Bt is going to be crucial and no model can tell us what it will be like in advance. We will all find out together from top to bottom.

**HUXt Model**

**HUXt Summary**

What a beautiful model I must say. I love everything about it. You can see that two impacts are forecasted with a high degree of confidence. Their velocity predictions and arrival times are in line with NOAA. I really appreciate how their model shows the sun/earth line and offers visual cues on the trajectory. I think that is very insightful.

**NASA Timelines & Modeling Panel**

As mentioned, I can't include a video for each NASA run so I decided to just include the panel that shows the results of each run. Keep in mind that the NASA model has a shock component which tends to overestimate geomagnetic effects. This is for guidance and consultation only, not firm expectations.

**OVERALL SUMMARY**

There is not much else that needs said. All of the details you need to know are compiled right here. If this thing breaks right, I expect a bunch of captures on r/SolarMax from all of you. We have multiple impacts on the way with a high degree of confidence in impact. We won't know the finer details until the party starts and our birds start feeding us data on the magnetic field, density, and velocity. Everything else is modeled guesswork until then. The range of outcomes is pretty wide but I think a G3 is the right call with more chance for a G2 than a G4 how I currently see it, but that could change depending on the Bz/Bt. I do think it is noteworthy that all of this is forecasted to occur on NYE and I am hoping that this adds to the festivity and that all factors will line up for one last auroral display to close 2024 which was a banner year for X-Class flares and geomagnetic storms with more X-class flares in 2024 than any other year in the X-ray flux era going back to the 1990s. We had two of the widest auroral displays in the last 4 centuries. This is to say nothing of the total solar eclipse we were treated to as well. All of these events were documented right here on this sub and I am proud of the track record and so privileged and filled with gratitude, that you are making a dream come true for me and reading this summary right now. It has been a hell of a run. I simply had no idea that 2024 was going to deliver like it did when I started this sub on 1/1/2024. I just had a feeling and I ran with it. Thank you for all of your support and interaction. There are no words I can use to tell you how it makes me feel. I am thrilled you are on this journey with me.

So with that said, I will update this post as details emerge if necessary. I will also start a new thread when the CMEs begin to arrive and start a megathread so we can all interact. I also encourage you to check out the r/solarmax discord and hear what the brain trust over there has to say and have a blast as we break it all down in real time with humor and excitement. I have been so busy lately that I have hardly been over there but I will be making my return in the coming days.

Backstory……. I drew up my two template copies on kraft paper.  Having just finished cutting the pieces for the sandbed, I spilled a full Yeti cup of HOT coffee on project and wound up dissolving/destroying the templates.  I saved the fish and constructed them, laying them out on a new piece of kraft paper along with the sandbed that I had tinned together.  (I foiled the fish sections and held them in plate on painters tape until I could tack solder them.  Push pins alone would not hold the small curved pieces in place.  The painters tape worked REALLY well).  I then cut the seaweed and water pieces “free form” around them.  (UyVey! But it worked).  I’m happy with the result.

But wait, it gets better.  Even using scrap/odd sized pieces from my light blue bin I basically ran out of large enough blue water rolled glass.  It was a discontinued color from Oceanside glass and they did not have any more in the warehouse.  After many choice words shouted at the universe, and checking for a place to get another (10x16) sheet, I found an identical texture/color at Hobby Lobby (12x12).  Their glass is thinner, sort of like window glass, but at this point beggers couldn’t be choosers.  It worked and I was able to finish my piece.  (Solder lines conceal the different glass thicknesses well).  Color matches 99%+.

I plan on buying a frame from “NorthernHardwoodFrames.com”  (2-18” + 2-24” and putting it together).  The pieces come mitered, predrilled and with plugs to cover up the screws.  Not yet sure if I will paint frame white or a deep bronze like the patina.  Lastly, I will add some acrylic embellishments for fish eyes, too small for me to cut into the glass, and for some white polyps on the corals.

Last comment….. I live in the Richmond, VA area and there are NO stained glass suppliers in my drivable area.  COVID killed all six.  There are a few galleries but they exist soley for commission work and repairs. I need to carefully figure out colors and amount of glass to buy online to make the most out of the added cost for shipping. That’s why I had to resort to HL for my last piece of glass.",2,1735586151.0,StainedGlass,1,1.0,False
1hpuxpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHospitalBeds/comments/1hpuxpf/can_adjustable_beds_help_with_acid_reflux/,Can Adjustable Beds Help With Acid Reflux?,"The Role of Adjustable Beds in Alleviating Acid Reflux Symptoms
---------------------------------------------------------------

For those who suffer from acid reflux, finding relief can often feel like an uphill battle. Acid reflux, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing discomfort and a burning sensation. One innovative solution that many people have explored is adjustable beds. But can adjustable beds truly help with acid reflux symptoms? Let’s dive into how they might provide relief.

### How Adjustable Beds Work

Adjustable beds have the ability to change positions, allowing you to elevate your head, feet, or various sections of your body. This customization can offer several benefits, particularly for those dealing with health issues like acid reflux. By elevating the head of the bed, gravity can help keep stomach acids where they belong—in the stomach.

#### The Mechanics of Relief

- **Gravity Assist:** When you raise your upper body, gravity works in your favor to prevent stomach acid from rising into the esophagus.
- **Improved Digestion:** Sleeping in a slightly elevated position can enhance digestion. This may reduce the chances of late-night reflux.
- **Spinal Alignment:** Adjustable beds support proper spinal alignment, which can contribute to overall comfort and well-being, thereby minimizing nighttime discomfort.

### Benefits of Sleeping on an Adjustable Bed for Acid Reflux

Using an adjustable bed can lead to various benefits that may greatly impact your quality of sleep and daily life. Here are a few ways these beds can help:

- **Reduced Symptoms:** Many users report fewer nighttime symptoms of acid reflux after switching to an adjustable bed, translating into a more restful sleep cycle.
- **Personalization:** These beds allow you to find your ideal sleep position, which can be particularly important for individuals whose reflux symptoms vary from night to night.
- **Enhanced Comfort:** Being able to adjust the bed easily means you can find what feels best for you, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.

#### Who Might Benefit the Most?

If you experience chronic heartburn or other symptoms of acid reflux regularly, an adjustable bed could be highly beneficial. This technology can complement other lifestyle changes recommended for managing reflux, such as:

1. Avoiding large meals before bedtime
2. Wearing loose-fitting clothing
3. Limiting caffeine and alcohol intake
4. Keeping the head and neck elevated, even beyond睡床 панели вниз

### Additional Considerations

While adjustable beds can provide substantial relief for many, it’s important to approach this solution with open eyes. Not everyone will experience the same outcomes. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, you may still need to explore other avenues. Here are a few tips to maximize the benefits of an adjustable bed:

- **Experiment with Elevation:** Try different degrees of elevation to understand what works best for your reflux symptoms.
- **Pair with Medication:** If you’re on medication for acid reflux, speak with your healthcare provider to ensure your treatment plan aligns well with your new sleeping arrangement.
- **Maintain Good Sleep Hygiene:** Establishing a calm, relaxing bedtime routine can also help improve overall sleep quality.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Besides understanding the effectiveness of adjustable beds on acid reflux, you might have more questions. Here are a couple of common inquiries:

**Do all adjustable beds help with acid reflux?**  
-Learn More about Hospital Beds For Your Home Here - https://hownow101.com/adjustable-hospital-beds/  
  
While many adjustable beds can help, the level of support may vary by brand and model. Be sure to choose one that fits your needs.

**Are there any drawbacks to consider?**  
Some users may find the cost to be a barrier, as adjustable beds can be more expensive than traditional beds. However, the potential increase in comfort and quality of sleep might outweigh the initial investment.

Adjustable beds can provide a practical solution for those struggling with acid reflux. By alerting the body and changing sleeping position, these beds offer a simple yet significant way to experience greater sleep comfort and potentially reduce symptoms. If you face nightly challenges due to acid reflux, give adjustable beds a try and see how they can enhance your sleep experience.

Lifestyle Changes to Complement Adjustable Beds for Optimal Acid Reflux Relief
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you struggle with acid reflux, you know how uncomfortable it can be. While adjustable beds can significantly enhance your sleeping experience and help ease symptoms, combining them with certain lifestyle changes can offer even more relief. Here’s how you can optimize your acid reflux management.

### Adjust Your Eating Habits

The food you eat plays a critical role in managing acid reflux. Here are some changes to consider:

-Learn More about Hospital Beds For Your Home Here - https://hownow101.com/adjustable-hospital-beds/  
  
- **Eat Smaller Meals:** Instead of three large meals, aim for five to six smaller ones. This prevents your stomach from becoming too full, which can trigger reflux.
- **Avoid Trigger Foods:** Certain foods, like spicy dishes, citrus fruits, and tomatoes, can worsen your symptoms. Keep track of what bothers you and eliminate those items from your diet.
- **Eat Early:** Try to finish your last meal at least three hours before bedtime. This gives your body enough time to digest before you lie down.

### Focus on the Right Beverages

Your drink choices can also impact acid reflux. Consider these tips:

- **Stay Hydrated:** Water is the best option. It helps with digestion and keeps your throat hydrated.
- **Avoid Caffeinated Drinks:** Coffee and other caffeinated beverages can relax the lower esophageal sphincter, allowing stomach acid to escape.
- **Limit Alcohol:** Alcohol can exacerbate reflux symptoms, so reducing or eliminating it may improve your comfort level.

### Incorporate Mindful Eating Practices

Mindful eating can make a huge difference in how your body processes food. Here’s how to practice it:

- **Chew Thoroughly:** Take your time to chew your food well. This not only makes digestion easier but also helps you feel full faster.
- **Eat Slowly:** Rushing meals can lead to swallowing air, which might increase bloating and discomfort. Try to enjoy your meals.

### Establish a Healthy Sleep Routine

Using an adjustable bed is a great start, but you can enhance its benefits by following these steps:

-Learn More about Hospital Beds For Your Home Here - https://hownow101.com/adjustable-hospital-beds/  
  
- **Maintain an Elevated Position:** Elevating your head about 30 degrees can help keep acid where it belongs. An adjustable bed is perfect for this.
- **Create a Sleep Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. A consistent routine helps regulate your gastrointestinal system.
- **Implement a Relaxation Technique:** Stress can worsen acid reflux. practices like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing into your evening routine can help calm your mind and body.

### Be Mindful of Your Weight

Maintaining a healthy weight can significantly reduce acid reflux symptoms. Here are some strategies:

- **Exercise Regularly:** Engage in moderate exercise like walking, which helps with digestion. Just avoid strenuous activities right after meals.
- **Track Your Progress:** Keep a food diary to monitor what you eat and any symptoms you experience. This can highlight patterns and help you make healthier choices.

### Consider Elevating Your Lifestyle Beyond the Bed

While adjustable beds are fantastic, other small adjustments can support your efforts:

- **Wear Loose Clothing:** Tight clothes can put pressure on your stomach. Choose loose-fitting outfits, especially during meals.
- **Avoid Lying Down After Eating:** Give your body time to digest food before reclining. Try to stay upright for a few hours post-meal.

These lifestyle changes along with a good quality adjustable bed can create a synergistic effect in managing your acid reflux symptoms. Remember, it’s essential to consult with healthcare professionals to tailor a plan that’s right for you. Take a holistic approach to your health, and you may find significant relief from acid reflux, allowing you to enjoy life more fully.

### Conclusion

Adjustable beds offer a promising solution for those struggling with acid reflux symptoms. By elevating the head and torso, these beds can help gravity work in your favor, potentially reducing the frequency and intensity of reflux episodes during sleep. This cradle-like support not only makes it easier to find a comfortable position but also promotes better airflow and digestion, which can be especially beneficial for individuals who experience discomfort from the acid that rises in the throat and esophagus.

However, relying solely on an adjustable bed may not be sufficient for everyone. Complementing this lifestyle adjustment with other healthy practices can maximize relief from acid reflux. It’s essential to evaluate your diet, as avoiding triggers like spicy foods, caffeine, and high-fat meals can drastically improve your symptoms. Additionally, adopting smaller meal sizes and avoiding late-night snacks can further minimize the chances of reflux occurring.

Regular exercise can also be a game-changer for managing acid reflux. Even light activities, like walking, can enhance digestion and overall well-being. Encouraging a holistic approach that includes an adjustable bed along with mindful dietary choices and an active lifestyle can create a comprehensive strategy for managing acid reflux.

By considering both the mechanical support of an adjustable bed and making thoughtful lifestyle changes, you can take significant steps toward a more comfortable and healthier living experience. Embracing these changes not only can lead to better sleep but also contribute to your overall quality of life.

I recently purchased a glass Hario V60 and I'm also on the way to purchase a Clever Dripper. My shipment for the Kingrinder K6 will also be here in around 20 days.

Before that arrives, I am using pre-ground coffee from a roastery.

1. Rwanda Muzo, pre-ground for V60:
flavour notes must be Cherry, Black Plum, Black Tea, and Milk Chocolate.
variety is Red Bourbon.
Region is Gakenke.
Process is Natural.
Altitude is 1650-1850m

It tastes too sour, and bad; as in tasting like acid reflux. It feels as if I'm vomiting in my own mouth. No sweetness at all. Can't get any of the notes.

I've used many, MANY different recipes (Hoffman's, Rao's, 4:6, Hedrick's), different bloom times, agitations, etc. all to no avail.

I was thinking it's an under-extraction issue, but I use 20:320 (1:17) ratio and boiling water, and my brew time is around 3:30 – 4:00 minutes. 

2. Ethiopia Gedeb, pre-ground for French Press:
flavour notes must be Pineapple, Peach, Blackberry, Winy, Floral, Hazelnut, and Chocolate.
variety is Heirloom.
Region is Gedeb.
Process is Anaerobic Natural.
Altitude is 2000-2100m

The exact same thing here!

I have some questions from the pros here.

1. What's going on?! Will the arrival of the grinder fix this? Or do you have a suggestion till it arrives?

2. I've been reading A HELL LOT about coffee recently. I'm so confused because of all of the different types of coffee beans, their processing, and how it affects the way you have to brew it. Can you explain their difference, and how they differ in results, and why you should brew them differently?

3. I still don't know what I like because of the billion varieties of coffee, but I know I like a sweet, smooth v60 (as I've had that in some cafés). Where do you think I should start, hoping to get to my beloved taste sooner?

It’s been a roller coaster of emotions and feelings since that have caused a ton of depression and anxiety. I fully cut him off for my own sanity. But he kept reaching out. So I made my stance clear and blocked him. I developed a routine and got into a good headspace and built a happy little lifestyle. 
4 days ago he showed up to my door unannounced insisting we schedule a time to talk. I said I was willing to with specific terms and that him showing up and reaching out was crossing the line. This morning I went to talk with him over coffee, expecting a closure talk, or for him to get things off his chest. What I was met with made the good mental state I was in far worse. We had booked a trip to Mexico to visit my grandmother in 3 weeks, when we were still together. I assumed he would not be going or would change his destination.  Where my grandmother lives is 1.5 hour drive from the airport. The town I’m flying into is not a tourist town, it’s very dangerous if you aren’t from there and there’s no sort of attractions there for entertainment. He told me this morning that he is still going, will be on the flight with me, and plans to “give me space”. Ever since this morning when he dropped the news that he would be there and refused to change his destination I have felt physically sick to my stomach and scared. I don’t know how to make this feeling go away and help myself not feel as bothered by this. He’s tip toeing the line of it seeming like I am in danger. And this all makes me feel unsafe and scared.

1hpus0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1hpus0q/yirgacheffe_roastingcupping_experiment_between/,"Yirgacheffe roasting/cupping experiment between ""extremes"" ","I thought it'd be interesting to do a roasting experiment between what I thought were reasonable extremes on some Yirgacheffe beans from Sweet Maria's. I divided the beans into three 800g roasts, with RoR and overall time roasted as the main differentiating factors. Every batch was dropped at 212°C/415°F, but I think my Kaleido often overestimates temperature by up to 20°F, so definitely some variance there.

R1: 12min total roast, FC at 10:41, FCe at 11:50. Dropped soon after.

R2: 10:35 total roast, FC at 8:30, FCe at 9:30.

R3: 8:16min total roast, FC at 5:03, FCe at 6:30.

After letting the coffee rest for 5 days, I cupped the roasts simultaneously with a 1:15 ratio. To my surprise, I thought R1 had the best overall results despite normally roasting Yirgacheffe closer to R2. In terms of color, R1 and R2 were very similar, while R3 was noticeably darker. This also translated to taste. Here are my notes:

* R1: fragrant, floral, slightly fruity and pleasant acidity
* R2: fairly similar to R1 but a bit more sour, flatter, not quite as bright. Perhaps needed some more time to rest?
* R3: darker, bitter, lacks the floral / fruity flavors normally associated with Ethiopian. Overall quite dull and not acidic at all.

I attached some pictures and one of the roast curves (R3). Based on the results, any tips on improvements to cupping or roasting? I might repeat this experiment with slight variations on R1 and R2, but my main takeaway is that I should aim for less time in the development stage (\~15%) for this varietal.

1hpurx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1hpurx5/psa_black_coffee_isnt_bad_the_coffee_you_chose_is/,"PSA: Black coffee isn't bad, the coffee you chose is","Just to give some of my background, I have been drinking coffee since I was a child. Ive had enough instant coffee to fill a small kiddie and some of those times I just downed the powder. I also worked at a coffee shop, dabbled in roasting my own beans and have gone from French press to a full espresso setup in my own home. 

One lesson I learned early on in life is that if the coffee tastes bitter and gross without cream, that the coffee either went bad or was poorly roasted (except for French and Italian dark roasts, those are roasted to go well with a cheap cigarette or are a blend of arabica and robusto which is notorious for adding bitterness). Also fun fact, there are some coffee companies that cut arabica beans with cheaper robusto beans to save them money. 

Depending on how you make your coffee, you can also make it bitter. Drip coffee on a heating plate will make it bitter as it slowly cooks the coffee. Using too high of a temperature for your brew method will create bitter coffee. An even dark or medium roast can have burn spots that creates bitter coffee. Having too fine a ground for your brew method will create bitter coffee. 

A good option for beginners is a French press. Pick up a nice coffee that prints the roast date on the package. If it doesn't have that, don't buy it. Old coffee has oils that become rancid and create bitter coffee. Next, take that coffee to a roaster and have it ground for French press. If you have a grinder that consistently grinds the right ground size, even better. Don't ask for finer when you haven't tried the base flavor. Some coffees are ok going finer while others don't do well. It doesn't make the coffee tastes better, it makes the coffee profile taste different. 

Next, load up that French press with the correct amount of coffee for water ration you are brewing. Don't add more, it can make it bitter. Heat up water to 185-190F. Lower is generally better for no bitter extractions but experiment with the temp as needed. If bitter, bring the temp down. Let it brew for the full 4ish minutes before dropping the plunger. Try your coffee. If you followed all of the directions above and still have bitter coffee, it's almost 100% bad coffee and you should try a different roaster. Also try light/medium roasts over dark as most roasters I've seen will struggle getting an even roast for dark roasts compared to medium or light roasts. 

Some key things to look for from a roaster that seems to help:

Do they have single origin coffees? If yes, that's a good sign

Do they have a flavored coffee? If yes, that is generally a bad sign

Do they offer organic single origin and identify on the package how the beans were processed, ie washed? If yes, that's a very good sign.

Do reviews for the coffee mention tasty pour overs? If yes, that's a good sign as pour overs give a good first impression on how a coffee will taste and are a common starting point for coffee people trying to explore more coffee. 

Is the roaster local to you? If yes, that's a good sign as you'll likely get fresher coffee that hasn't been sitting on a shelf getting shipped around the country for months.

Thank you to whoever compiled all this info! I (F/62) am newly diagnosed with FH and have an appointment next week with a lipids clinic. What should I expect during the evaluation? I'm told it will be about an hour long, but don't have any other specifics on what to expect. I'd like to make the most of my appointment, so any insights or tips would be much appreciated. Thank you! Read on for a little bit more about me. 

I was diagnosed with FH based on a routine lipids panel, by a new PCP, who prescribed Crestor (which I have not started yet). I asked for the more in-depth testing that's available, and was instead referred to a lipids clinic, as the test I asked for was more specialized than she usually orders. I have now done the testing for lipoprotein a, apolipoprotein b, and NMR particle sizes, and know my results via the online portal. I don't have a history of heart disease, not diabetic or pre-diabetic, do not have high blood pressure, and I'm an intermittent faster. I eat cleanish with room for improvement. I only drink water, coffee & tea.  I am overweight but not obese (~15 lbs from normal weight based on BMI).  I wear a Fitbit, track my weight daily, and have a log of what I've eaten (sans amounts/details) for ~ the last 4 months.  Once I have my consultation with the lipids clinic, I'll likely ask more questions about how I can improve my diet, etc. Right now I want to know how I can best prepare for my appointment and what are relevant questions to ask and/or info to take with me.

Whenever I come across new coffee capsules, I can’t resist buying them to try out. But I’ve made the mistake of buying the wrong ones a few times because I didn’t realize there are different types of capsules. I just assumed they were all the same.

For example, I bought some CoffeeB capsules, which are way too small for my machine, and Dolce Gusto ones, which are like twice the size of my regular capsules. Now I have a collection of capsules that don’t fit my machine.

So, other than throwing them in the trash, does anyone have creative ideas for what I can do with them? Or better yet, can someone explain which capsules are the right ones for my machine?

1hpumgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonBrandReviews/comments/1hpumgc/product_review_contigo/,Product Review Contigo,"In-Depth Review of Contigo Products: Features and Benefits
----------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to staying well-hydrated on the go, Contigo brings an array of products designed to make your life easier and more enjoyable. Their innovative designs focus on not only functional aspects but also aesthetics, making them a popular choice among consumers. Let’s dive deeper into what makes Contigo products stand out.

Contigo's signature feature is their spill-proof technology. This is especially beneficial for people who are always on the move. With the press of a button, you can drink from your Contigo bottle without worrying about leaks. The lid designs aim to provide an easy one-handed operation, making it ideal for drivers, joggers, or people with busy lifestyles.

### Durable Materials

Contigo products are built to last. Most bottles and mugs are made from stainless steel, which offers excellent insulation and durability. This means you can take your beverage anywhere without the fear of spills or breakage. The surface is often powder-coated, providing a non-slip grip and added protection against scratches. Customers appreciate this longevity as it reduces the need for frequent replacements.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-contigo  
  
### Variety of Sizes and Designs

Another advantage is the variety of sizes. Contigo offers products ranging from compact travel mugs to larger water bottles meant for hiking trips. Some popular sizes include:

- 12 oz - Perfect for a quick coffee on the way to work.
- 20 oz - Great for daily hydration.
- 32 oz - Ideal for outdoor activities or extended use.

The wide assortment in design also allows for personalization. Consumers can choose from different colors and patterns, catering to both preference and lifestyle. Whether you like sleek metallic finishes or vibrant patterns, there is likely a Contigo product that fits your style.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-contigo  
  
### Insulation Performance

One of the standout features of Contigo mugs and bottles is their insulation performance. With double-wall vacuum insulation, beverages stay hot or cold for hours. For example, a hot coffee can remain warm for up to seven hours, where cold beverages can stay frosty for up to 24 hours. This makes Contigo an excellent option for anyone who wants their drinks to maintain the perfect temperature throughout the day.

### The Cleaning Experience

Keeping your drinkware clean can often be a hassle, but Contigo simplifies this with their dishwasher-safe components. Most products have removable parts that are easy to clean and maintain. This ensures that you spend less time scrubbing, and more time enjoying your beverages. Some products also come with a built-in filter for added convenience when using them with fruit infusions or iced teas.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-contigo  
  
### Environmentally Friendly Choices

Using Contigo can also contribute positively to the environment. By choosing reusable bottles and cups over single-use plastic, you are making a conscious decision to reduce waste. Many customers appreciate brands that promote sustainability, and Contigo aligns with that value by offering long-lasting, reusable products.

Another noteworthy feature is their commitment to safety. Many Contigo items are made without BPA (Bisphenol A), a chemical often found in plastics that can pose health risks. You can feel good knowing that while you stay hydrated, you are also making a safer choice for your health.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-contigo  
  
### Affordability and Accessibility

Contigo products are reasonably priced, providing excellent value for the features you get. Typically ranging from $10 to $30, you can find a product that suits your budget. Plus, they are widely available at various retailers, both online and in physical stores. This makes it easy for consumers to find a Contigo product that fits their needs.

Contigo has established itself as a brand that excels in creating user-friendly, stylish, and durable drinkware. Their products not only serve a functional purpose but also appeal to those who care about design and environmental impact. When considering your next bottle or mug, Contigo makes an excellent choice that combines innovation with practicality, bringing you the benefits you need for your hydration journey.

Comparing Contigo with Other Leading Travel Mug Brands
------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to travel mugs, Contigo stands out with its innovative designs and user-friendly features. However, there are several other brands vying for your attention, and it's fair to compare Contigo with leading competitors like Thermos, Zojirushi, and CamelBak. Each brand brings unique qualities to the table, making it essential for you to know what differentiates them.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-contigo  
  
### Contigo: Features and Benefits

Contigo is well-known for its leak-proof technology and easy-to-use features. Many of their mugs come with an Autoseal lid that automatically seals between sips, preventing spills. This makes it ideal for those of you who are always on the go. Additionally:

- **Design:** Their sleek designs are available in various colors, appealing to a wide range of users.
- **Ease of Cleaning:** Many models are dishwasher-safe, simplifying your cleaning routine.

### Comparison with Other Brands

To provide a clearer picture, let’s take a look at how Contigo stacks up against its competitors.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-contigo  
  
#### Thermos

Thermos products are renowned for their longevity and performance. While Contigo provides good insulation, Thermos takes it a step further:

- **Performance:** Thermos mugs can keep liquids hot for up to 12 hours, which is impressive for those longer commutes.
- **Durability:** Made from stainless steel, many Thermos mugs are designed for rugged use.
- **Options:** Thermos offers an extensive array of sizes and styles, appealing to various needs.

Though Thermos mugs may not be as visually appealing as Contigo, their performance in thermal retention is noteworthy.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-contigo  
  
#### Zojirushi

Zojirushi is another heavy-hitter in the travel mug industry. Known for its high-quality vacuum insulation, it provides remarkable heat retention:

- **Thermal Efficiency:** Some Zojirushi mugs can keep beverages hot for up to 6 hours and cold for 24 hours.
- **Design and Functionality:** They often feature a wide mouth for easy filling and cleaning, making them user-friendly.
- **Versatility:** Many products are designed for both hot and cold drinks, giving you multiple uses.

While Zojirushi products are more expensive, their performance might justify the price for enthusiasts seeking the best.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-contigo  
  
#### CameLbak

CamelBak, primarily known for its hydration packs, also offers travel mugs. Here’s how they compare:

- **Innovative Design:** CamelBak mugs can feature unique designs that are focused on athletes and outdoor enthusiasts.
- **Replaceable Parts:** Many of their products allow for easy replacement of parts, which can be a cost saver in the long run.
- **Comfort:** The ergonomic design is comfortable to hold, making it easy for you to sip even during activities.

### Price Range and Value

When considering cost, Contigo offers affordable options ranging from $15 to $30, making it accessible for many. Other competitors vary significantly:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-contigo  
  
- **Thermos:** Prices typically hover between $20 to $40.
- **Zojirushi:** Expect to pay from $25 to $50, depending on features.
- **CamelBak:** Their mugs usually range from $20 to $35.

This makes Contigo an excellent value for everyday users who need a reliable travel mug without breaking the bank.

### Overall Impressions

Ultimately, your choice between Contigo and other brands largely depends on your specific needs. If you prioritize function over form, Thermos and Zojirushi might be better options. However, if you are looking for cool designs and user-friendly features, Contigo may be the perfect match. CamelBak appeals to those with an active lifestyle, offering creative designs and functionality.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-contigo  
  
Reflecting on your daily habits will guide you toward the perfect travel mug for your lifestyle. Whether you choose Contigo or another brand, investing in a quality travel mug can significantly improve your drinking experience on the go.

I (25f) had a friend in college (25m) and we clicked really well. Would hang out often and I had a huge crush on him. He made a move a few times and eventually we slept together once (he initiated) before I got sucked into an extremely unhealthy and toxic relationship. Finally broke out of my relationship a few years later but still always had slight feelings for him. He got a girlfriend between then, but we remained friends. I’ve even met his girlfriend and hung out with them. He moved across the country after college but most times when he’s in town, we’ll get together for a drink or something. A few months ago, he bought me breakfast and coffee and we sat together on the beach and ate and talked for hours. Over the holidays, he was home and I actually took him to his first rave and we had a great time dancing all night. I never completely lost feelings and I still have a small crush, but we still have a great friendship even though we’re not super close. I would never make a move on him since he’s in a serious relationship, and he would never make a move on me. Given our past, do you think it’s possible that we just have a great friendship still and there is nothing there anymore? Or do you think he could possibly feel the same way and still have slight feelings, even though nothing would ever happen?

This isn’t a question on if he would cheat on his girlfriend. He is a very respectful guy and I wouldn’t want or let him do that even if he wanted to. I just want to know what he’s feeling and if there are any guys that have had a situation where they have slept with a friend and stayed friends with them and how they feel about them after everything?

It seems I never go a few months without a new bruise—usually acquiring them within my own home (walking into open cabinets or coffee tables, etc) and every now and then, out of my home from a fall (I have started cane training recently for this reason). 

My post isn’t a question but just more of a discussion. Yesterday I got a brand new bruise/cut on my head while doing laundry, and while sitting down to ice it, I caught myself spiraling into the unknown. Now, I have cultivated a strong mindfulness and self-compassion practice over the years to counter these anxious feelings, but I couldn’t help but notice how I b-lined for the worst: what awaits when I’m older, with less vision? will I be able to endure these kinds of bangs? will my life be cut short from a collision with a sharp corner or a fall? I once heard a story of a woman with RP falling down the stairs to her death—something that can happen to anyone but we are just more vulnerable—and it truly stuck with me.

I’m currently 35f and have less than 20% of my visual field but don’t regularly use a cane (although like I said, started training). Most people I meet don’t know I’m legally blind until I tell them. I’m building a house and my husband is doing everything he can to make it safe (no stairs, rounded corners of walls, etc). I love my life and am so grateful for the vision I have. Most days it doesn’t get to me. But after an injury like yesterday, I want to know I’m not the only one spiraling into the worst—and would also love to hear from older folks about how you adapt!

So, I met this guy at uni.  I didn't talk to him much because I was dating someone at the time. I later broke up with this guy. I started to like him suddenly and unexpectedly. We started texting as colleagues and he never fails to make me laugh. During class he was playing with my computer cables and asked me ""*Name* does your mouse work?"" ""*Name* check your keyboard."". He was basically sabotaging me. Also he was late to class and I told him that we'll have a quiz (I meant next week) and he got scared and thought I meant in that very moment, I turned to him and said that it will be next week. Then he slapped me on my lower back and said ""Don't joke with me like that."". Over text he said ""We'll go out for coffee after maths 😉."" He was quite persistent. We also make eye contact all the time. When he sits next to me he is constantly moving, bounces his leg up and down or fixes his hair or his hoodie. He also is always offering to help me study or explain anything that I don't understand. He lives in a different city and has told me that he wants to drive me to his city so we could have coffee there. He is also really attentive and noticed that my eyes were watery and asked me if I was okay. He also drove me home once cause I couldn't find any transportation. He initiates convos sometimes but only about uni and he doesn't ask me how I am or what I'm doing unless I ask him first. It's like he's closed off, maybe he's scared because he's from a different city. It's like he's hot and cold, one moment and so closed off the next.

Whenever one dares to complain about improper spelling or poor grammar, people immediately start saying ""What if English isn't their first language?"" or some remark like that. This is just cowardice! ESL speakers and native speakers generally do not make the same mistakes — I've never seen a native speaker say ""Can you tell me what is the...?"" where the word order should be ""Can you tell me what the ... is?"", and similarly it is extremely rarely that I've seen an ESL speaker use 'you're' in place of 'your'. Not to mention that actual ESL speakers tend to appreciate being corrected, because they're actually trying to speak English well, and it's really only native speakers who feel that they have no obligation to others to communicate clearly and properly. 

Wikipedia and Wiktionary are free and easy to use. There's no excuse for a native speaker of English to write that their coffee ""costed 12$"", and there's no ESL speaker who would be mad at being told the proper way to write it. Honestly, I feel like ESL speakers are some of the only people who actually care about the language; most of my fellow native speakers seem to be willfully and proudly ignorant.

1hpu6r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hpu6r0/did_i_screw_up_or_was_he_just_a_jerk/,Did I screw up or was he just a jerk??,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been struggling with something on my mind for the past three weeks and thought I’d share it here to get some perspective from outsiders.

Up until recently, I(F27) was dating a guy(M30) I met on Bumble on Halloween night. It felt to good to be true at first—he was the only one I messaged, and I thought I’d hit the jackpot. From our very first conversation, he seemed genuinely interested in me, and by the second day, he’d already asked me out on a dinner date.

Things escalated quickly but in a way that felt exciting and natural at the time. After our second date, I ended up spending two days at his place. He encouraged me to bring my work and study materials since I do both remotely. It felt like he really wanted to integrate me into his life. After that, we were inseparable. He was constantly texting, even at odd hours like 4:00 a.m., sharing book ideas or random thoughts. I even had to ask him to let me sleep sometimes!

By the third date, we were decorating his house for Christmas—buying not one but two Christmas trees - one black, because I don't know, he thought it was different. It felt surreal, almost like something out of a rom-com. He even wanted me to leave some of my belongings at his place: slippers, underwear, pajamas, my coffee machine, etc. He bought us matching Christmas mugs because we both love tea and coffee. It felt like we were building something special. I mean, he even bought me expensive shampoo and skincare for god's sake.

But things weren’t perfect. He could be dismissive—like when we were cooking, he'd put on his Elvis and Johnny Cash playlist and when I said I wanted to share some of my favourite songs as well and I'd play Taylor Swift, and he’d leave the room because he “couldn’t stand her and her music,” or how he refused to watch romantic Christmas movies, insisting on horror or crime instead. Not that I forced him to watch, I just wanted to share some of my Christmas traditions. Still, I figured we didn’t have to like all the same things to make it work. Even if he didn't make an effort to even tolerate some of the stuff I liked.

We'd talk about the future and potentially getting into a relationship.

He even took some the last two weeks of December off so we could go somewhere together during my winter break from school. I thought this was real and was going somewhere.

But then, out of nowhere, things started to shift. I noticed small changes, like him not greeting me with the same enthusiasm when I came over. Once, I went to kiss him, and he rolled his eyes at me. I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe he’d had a bad day. And the worst was when we went to the Christmas market that last week and some guy was handing free food samples and he came up to us and said we looked like a cute couple and the look at his face said everything. He had the same face your mother makes when she is annoyed at you. And after that we went to see the Swan Lake ballet because he had bought tickets.

After the ballet, we went to his house and stayed the weekend there, playing board games, going to the mall and Christmas shopping. He'd ask me if I liked any particular jewellery and I said I liked stuff with meaning behind. Like I gave him a ramen bowl Christmas ornament for one of his trees because he loves Japanese food and I thought it would make a cute little gift.

Then came the bombshell: after I left his house that Sunday, he ghosted me for a few days, and when he finally texted, he said he didn’t think my personality was a good fit for him. He said he’d been thinking and didn’t see a future with me. It hurt, but I didn’t argue—I just said, “If that’s what you want.”

Looking back, I wish I’d said more. I wish I could have screamed at him. But I was so overwhelmed with grief and sadness—especially with everything else going on in my life, like the stress of just starting to learn software development from scratch and expecting to present results real soon like I just started in October and was one of the few people in my class that had never done it before. And also my grandmother needed to have surgery because of cancer complications the week before he left—that I didn’t have the energy to fight. I remember when I received that message I was in the middle of a very difficult JAVA test and was very emotional because I needed to go finish the test and hurry to catch the bus to go to the hospital to see my grandmother for the first time since her surgery.

After he sent that message, he blocked me on everything. I had noticed he updated his Bumble profile while we were spending our last weekend together but didn't said anything, even if I was starting to worry because the signs where there and I wanted to keep my cool. He had changed one of his prompts to say he was looking for someone “smart, kind, and who respects herself.” That stung. Was he implying I didn’t meet those standards?

Two days after the final text, I was angry. I was angry because I shared something very vulnerable and he didn't reply. Just stayed silent. He said communication was a must but he left me on read.

I thought I was lucky, but it turned out to be just another modern fairytale—intense and magical at first, only to fizzle out just as quickly. Remember that this just started from early November to early December so, just one month.

My therapist thinks he might have been a love bomber—someone who’s after a fleeting feeling rather than a real connection. It makes sense, given how quickly he made me feel safe and secure only to pull the rug out from under me.

I think that maybe he was surprised by my response. That I didn't try to argue with him. I think he was looking for some sort of reaction from me. Now I wish I had said something but it's too late.

I can’t help but wonder if he mistook my vulnerability for weakness or if he was simply pretending to be perfect. Either way, I feel so discarded, like garbage. The fact that he still has some of my stuff—stuff I don’t even want back—makes it worse. Did he throw it away?

He even bought a kitchen robot and made me focaccia and other things. He'd do everything but still, I remember thinking that or he was actually perfect or was great at pretending. Not to mention he being a lawyer at a big international firm and was always complaining about his bosses and colleagues saying that he is planning on finding a better job because his bosses didn't want to grow the company and he can't stand people with low ambition.

I admit I could have handled things better, but at the time, I didn’t feel like I was doing anything wrong. I’d confide in him about how much I was struggling with school and how I sometimes wondered if I’d made a mistake leaving my small town and stable, albeit boring, job. After all, I had just moved to the big city at the end of September to chase a new career in programming, which has been a steep learning curve. He’d reassure me, saying I just needed to give it time and that starting something new was always challenging. But deep down, I felt weighed down by melancholy—like I embodied the sadness in some of Taylor Swift’s songs. Maybe my vulnerability annoyed him or turned him off. Or he found someone else because I can't help myself to think that I might have seen some scratch marks on his back.

I’m angry, confused, and hurt. How can someone welcome you into their life, make you feel at home, and then discard you so easily? Was this a situationship? Or was it something else entirely? He had said he was looking for a relationship just not with someone like me.

I know I can be pretty avoidant but I'm a work in progress and I didn't want to trauma dump so early in the game. Like we were strangers. He couldn't possible know the real me with just a month of dating. And I thought we had a genuine connection and was a start of a good friendship but I guess he was not interest in becoming my friend.

I’d appreciate any advice or insights you might have. It feels great to have someone besides my therapist and friends to share this story with. Thank you.",0,1735584262.0,dating_advice,9,0.5,False

**Looking to transform your voice into polished professional content? This** [Letterly](https://www.easyviralbiz.com/appsumo) **review might be exactly what you need! Let's dive into how this AppSumo Tool of the Year for 2024 could revolutionize your content creation process.**

# Key Takeaways:

* **AppSumo Tool of the Year 2024**
* **27 different content formats**
* **15-minute recording limit per session**
* **Works offline and with screen off**
* **One-time purchase vs. yearly subscription**
* **Rating: 7.7/10**

# Pricing Comparison Table:

|Feature|[Letterly AppSumo Deal](https://www.easyviralbiz.com/appsumo)|Regular Plan|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|Cost|$59 (one-time)|$99/year|
|Recording Limit|15 minutes|15 minutes|
|Rewrite Options|27+|27+|
|Trial Available|Yes (7 days)|Yes (7 days)|
|Users/Devices|Varies by tier|Varies by tier|

I recently took Letterly for a test drive, and *boy*, was I in for a surprise! This isn't your grandmother's voice-to-text app – it's like having a personal content wizard in your pocket.

**First Impressions Matter**, and Letterly nails it with a sleek, professional website that actually loads properly (mostly). As someone who's seen enough clunky UIs to last a lifetime, this was a refreshing start.

# The Setup Process

Getting started is smoother than a buttered penguin sliding down an iceberg. Just scan the QR code from their website, and you're whisked away to your platform's app store. *Pro tip*: Start with the free 7-day trial, but immediately cancel the subscription to avoid any accidental charges.

**The Interface** is clean and intuitive, offering three main options:

* AI-powered text editor
* Voice recording button
* Settings gear

# The Magic Behind the Scenes

Here's where things get interesting. I decided to test it with a rant about SaaS products and lifetime deals (because why not?). The app not only captured my rambling perfectly but transformed it into various content formats.

**Content Transformation Options Include**:

* Newsletter formats
* Social media posts
* Email templates (formal & casual)
* Meeting summaries
* Task lists
* Journal entries

# Real-World Testing

I put Letterly through its paces with several tests:

1. **Offline Recording**: Works like a charm, though you'll need internet for the AI magic
2. **Screen-Off Recording**: Perfect for those ""idea in the shower"" moments
3. **Shopping List Creation**: Turned my rambling about groceries into a clean, formatted list

# The Good, The Bad, and The ""Meh""

**The Good**:

* Exceptional voice capture accuracy
* Multiple content format options
* Works offline and with screen off
* Clean, intuitive interface
* One-time purchase option via AppSumo

**The Bad**:

* 15-minute recording limit
* No desktop version
* Markdown-only export
* Still uses ""hope this message finds you well"" (*facepalm*)

# Practical Applications

Imagine walking your dog and dictating your next newsletter, or recording meeting notes that automatically transform into actionable summaries. *That's* the kind of productivity boost we're talking about.

The app shines particularly bright for content creators, business professionals, and anyone who prefers talking over typing (looking at you, hunt-and-peck typists!).

# Value Proposition

At $59 (AppSumo lifetime deal) versus $99/year for the regular subscription, the math isn't just good – it's *chef's kiss*. That's like buying a pizza every month versus owning the whole pizzeria.

# Future-Proofing Concerns

The elephant in the room: Will this become obsolete when native OS features catch up? Maybe. But for now, it's solving a real problem with a polished solution.

# What Could Be Better

A few wishes for the Letterly team:

1. **Longer recording limits** (60 minutes would be ideal)
2. **Desktop version** integration
3. **More export format options** beyond Markdown
4. **AI language variations** (goodbye, ""hope this finds you well"")

# The Verdict

With a solid **7.7/10** rating, Letterly isn't perfect, but it's pretty darn close for what it aims to do. It's like having a content assistant who never sleeps, doesn't drink your coffee, and doesn't complain about your midnight brainstorming sessions.

For anyone who:

* Creates regular content
* Attends numerous meetings
* Prefers voice over typing
* Values time efficiency

This tool could be a game-changer in your productivity arsenal.

**Ready to transform your voice into professional content? The AppSumo lifetime deal for Letterly might be your best investment this year. Don't miss out on this Tool of the Year – check it out and start creating content the smarter way!**

1hpu3w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/comments/1hpu3w1/excellence_el_carmen_review/,Excellence El Carmen Review,"Currently laying by the pool on our last day of our 7 day trip.  It’s December 30th, 2024 for anyone visiting this post in the future.  I’m not sure how much detail I wanna go into here but I’ll go until I’m bored. 

Room: 8/10.  
There were no major issues with our room.  As many have stated in their YouTube videos, the rooms have some miles on them.  All the lighting is from lamps, no lights attached to the ceilings or anything.  There was a crack above the mirror.  The mirror had some rust towards the top.  The sliding doors didn’t slide smoothly.  Shit like that.  Literally, who cares.  There’s no way I could give it any higher than an 8, but nothing that actually made our stay worse. I will say that I was worried about the AC and humidity in the room, but it was excellent and I slept like a baby every night.  I like a more firm mattress and I’m bougie with my tempur-pedic at home but this mattress was great.  

Service: 8/10
I wouldn’t say I felt genuine kindness from the majority of the staff here.  The smoothie lady remembered my order this morning, same with the coffee ladies.  I’ve had some great interactions with the staff, but many also don’t even smile when you talk to them and you feel like they don’t wanna be there.  I’ve definitely had friendlier staff elsewhere, but this isn’t bad by any means.  The restaurants are usually pretty good.  It’s the same as service anywhere else, it varies based on who you get.  

Food: 9/10
I can’t believe this was one of the best aspects of the trip.  I read how the DR is worse than Mexico for food.  Granted, there were misses at almost all of our meals, whether that’s an app or an entree depends on the place.  But overall I was absolutely impressed with the food and I’ve been in the industry my whole life.  The quality of the meat and fish was actually good.  I didn’t expect to enjoy the lobster tail or filet mignon, but they really nailed most dishes.  The one thing I’ll say is that the consistency is poor.  A fruit plate one day isn’t the same as the next day.  The watermelon juice tastes one way, then another the next, or at a different restaurant.  One day they tell you that you can’t bring your food to the pool and another day you can.  The consistency is poor which is why you may get very different reviews of restaurants and even the resort as a whole.  The breakfast is the biggest miss for me.  The breakfast buffet is terrible, room service is mediocre and the lobster house menu is limited.  That’s pretty much it for options unless you’re in the Excellence Club. 

Entertainment: 7/10
Some shows are good, others are boring.  It’s subjective of course, as my wife liked some of the shows I didn’t care for.  The silent disco was fun, Michael Jackson show was entertaining, etc.  We’re also early birds so waiting until 9:30 for it to start is a bit annoying. 

Pro Tips:
1. They have $45 for an hour massage if you walk 10 mins to the right when you hit the beach.  I think it’s called Island Treasures.  We did that twice and it was awesome.  Since you’re not in the most legit establishment, maybe stick with the relaxing massage and not deep tissue. 

2. We were there from December 24-31st and in the middle of the trip, when it was pretty busy, people started claiming chairs at the pool in the morning so be careful if you’re visiting during busier times.  We had to start claiming by 9-10 if you wanted a spot. 

3. Weather in the DR during this time is a bit hit or miss.  We didn’t get a single day of rain, but the highs border between 77-84.  On a cloudier and colder day, we didn’t really enjoy the pool/beach.  It’s just bordering on beach weather imo. 

4. There’s a smoothie spot by the main pool area by the food truck. 

5. If you do archery, go early.  Getting there 15 mins early will save you 45 mins of having to watch everyone go before you.  Again, probably more of an issue since we went at a busy time.  

I wish you could order food when just chilling by the pool.  That was a big downer for me.  

The pool was piss warm the first 4 days and then pretty cold the last 3 and we have no idea why. We had a personal pool, but we literally didn’t use it once bc my wife wanted to be by the action. Won’t be doing that again lol.  

I didn’t like having to wait anywhere from 10-30 mins to be sat most nights at the restaurants.  Like just do reservations so I don’t have to wait around.  There’s no text to tell you you’re ready, you just need to guess when it’s ready and go back inside and see.  

The restaurants didn’t have any bars.  Sometimes my wife and I like to sit at a bar and eat.  Don’t think that’s much of an option there.  

There’s probably more and I’m missing a bunch but feel free to ask any questions.  

Overall, we loved it and thought for the value it was the best of the 3 all inclusives we’ve done together.  The other two were in Mexico, one being our honeymoon in Puerto Vallarta and the other being a boutique resort in the Cancun area. 

We would absolutely come back. ",3,1735584068.0,PuntaCana,0,1.0,False
1hpu3vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hpu3vj/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting ?,"My gf & I (also f) have been together for almost 2 years. When we used to get into fights or arguments, I’d always leave the house to cool down. She expressed to me she doesn’t like when I do that so I respected that & stopped. She would still use it against me every fight & tell me “so what ? Are you going to leave like you always do ?” & I tell her no. There are times I do want to leave & she guilt trips me every time for wanting time to cool off even tho I communicate to her & tell her how long I’d be gone etc. Her reason for not wanting me to leave is because she thinks it’s unfair I get to leave since I have a car & she doesn’t. I even tell her she can take my car if she really wanted to, I just want to go for a quick walk. She tells me that it’s so easy for me to leave & I try to reason with her & tell her I’m communicating with her & letting her know how long I’ll be gone. 

We got into a fight maybe 2 weeks ago & I wanted to leave the house. I didn’t end up leaving because she guilt tripped me. Fast forward to last night, we got into another fight & she left without saying a word. I felt it was a slap in the face because why can she just leave without me putting up a fight but I can’t ?I ended up giving in & called her around 10pm to ask if she thinks this is okay. She said no yet she made no effort to come home. We live 2 minutes from work so she ended up walking to work & prepping things for tmrw (we work in a coffee shop). She left around 8pm & didn’t text me or call me, NOTHING She kept trying to cut me off & I told her “no, you can listen to me” & she said “I ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOU !” & I said “& I always listen to YOU” & she said I don’t. I told her I’m the one who called HER so I feel like it’s only fair that I get what I have to say off my chest first & then she can talk because she just kept cutting me off & accused me of not listening to her when I do. We got off the phone maybe 5 min later & around 11:40pm ish I asked her what time she’s planning on coming home, she said she just needs to finish cleaning her mess she made at work & she’d leave in in a few minutes. I have her location & at 12:13am I saw she was still at work. I called her & was like “I thought you said you’d be done in a few minutes at 11:40 ? It’s been a half hour” & she said “I never said I’d be done in a few minutes” & said she was leaving work. This was at 12:13am when I called her. It’s a 2 minute walk to get home. She didn’t get home until almost 1am. Am I overreacting for getting so upset ???????

Another thing that happened was a year ago we got into a huge fight while we were parked at a store near where we live & she ended up getting out of the car & started walking (we live in Hawai’i & where we’re located, everything is in walking distance). I kept telling her to get in the car but she wouldn’t listen. I ended up not being able to find her cause she walks fast. I tried calling her & texting her but she wouldn’t answer. I saw her trying to cross the street & I begged her to just get in the car & we can talk about it. She refused. I kept begging her to at least just text or answer my calls. She refused. I ended up giving up & just went back home. All my texts & calls went unanswered so I wasn’t going to just sit at home and be sad. I ended up calling one of my friends that I haven’t seen for a bit and asked if she wanted to get a drink at a bar near me. She said yes so I got ready. When I was about to leave the house, my gf came home & got mad that I was going somewhere. I told her I wasn’t about to just sit in this house sad & distraught because she wasn’t answering my texts or calls. It was a whole big thing & she was telling me it’s fucked up I was leaving & I was like excuse me ???? Look what you just did to me. It’s not wrong for her to do what she did to me but it’s wrong for me to leave to go get a quick drink ?

SO PLEASE TELL ME, am I overreacting ??? I just need some peace of mind knowing I’m not going fucking crazy because I’m always left feeling like I’m wrong for feeling the way I feel.",2,1735584067.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.67,False

Other than being near family, there is absolutely nothing we enjoy about living in Oklahoma. Colorado as a whole is much more aligned with the type of lifestyle we want to have together, and we are trying to figure out what area of Colorado would be the best fit for us as a soon-to-be married couple in our mid-late 20s.

We both love the outdoors and want to be somewhere with mountain views and easy access to the mountains. We are looking for beautiful natural scenery and hiking trails. We are not into partying or nightlife, but would like to be somewhere with a more quaint/quiet atmosphere and good options for local restaurants, coffee shops, etc. We have a dog as well, so walkability is a plus. 

I work remote and my fiancé is completing his computer science degree this spring, so availability of tech jobs or other industries that hire tech-related roles within a reasonable commute is an important factor.

Ultimately where we end up will depend on where my fiancé gets a job, but we are wondering what areas for him to prioritize applying for positions. Any suggestions on a location or moving to Colorado in general would be much appreciated! Thank you in advance :) ",0,1735584060.0,SameGrassButGreener,2,0.5,False

Are they hoping I'll leap at the carrot?

We countered with:  
""if appraisal is > listed price, seller accepts"" and  
""if appraisal is < listed price, buyer makes up the difference""

And the most obvious thing is that I experienced the same thing even in the mornings, I do not consume any weed or caffeine. 

I’m trying to look in things like apnea and whatnot but the fact that for the first hour or so, my mood is really up there. I don’t feel groggy or miserable when I wake up. (unless it’s early in the morning and I woke up because I had to not because I naturally woke up)

I have a US Mr Coffee Cafe Barista BVMC-ECMP1000 and it worked excellent when I first got it. After a few uses, while using the double latte mode in auto it would overflow the same cup I always used. I would turn the dial to less foam or more foam to see if it differed. Some days it was perfect, other days it would overflow. One morning while I was using the double latte feature it overflowed and I tried getting it to stop. Not knowing how to fully function the machine I pressed the buttons in some secret morse code only the machine understands. Since then, the double latte auto mode does not even make near half of the single latte auto mode. The single/double espresso/cappuccino auto modes work perfectly. Even the single latte auto mode works perfectly. The manual froth/espresso/clean all work as desired. I am only fighting with the double latte auto mode to give full amount of foam as previous. I have read the manual, searched on the web for videos, descaled the machine, and checked any o-rings for damage.

1hptp8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1hptp8w/how_to_sit_down_and_study_for_hours/,How to sit down and study for hours,"Studying is a refined skill that takes time to cultivate, I want to explore with you the common obstacles that people face and what you can do about them.

# If It’s hard to digest:

One of the following reasons may behind why it’s hard for you to go through the material:

**It’s not well explained**:

Look for other sources for the topic you’re trying to learn. There are countless videos, free courses, and AI tools that can provide alternative explanations, which might make a concept click for you.

I studied engineering in the past, and some online videos taught the material better than some of my teachers, now ChatGPT can do it even better.

**You skipped the basics**:

If it feels like they’re speaking another language or you consistently go back and review previous definitions, concepts, rules, etc then you need to properly review the basics. You might think you’re saving time by skimming over things, but your brain needs a solid jumping-off point to connect the dots. Without that foundation, the material will feel like it’s slipping though your fingers.

Yes, I know, who wants to review the basics for the second, third, or fourth time, right?

**Lack of focus:**

Even the simplest concepts can be hard to understand if you’re not focused and present. You may think you’re focused, but it wouldn’t hurt to check.

How often do you get interrupted, and by what? If you can’t go a single hour without being interrupted, you need to address the cause of the disruption, try to minimize or get rid of noise, get your phone in another room.

Not being exposed to the stimulus is much easier than being exposed and resisting the impulse to give in.

You weren’t thinking about a pink elephant before reading this sentence but now try not to think about it.

# If it’s unpleasant:

Studying can sometimes feel like a lose-lose situation, you need to study for hours every day, ignore all the good and fun things around you, and barely make a dent in your grades, or you can simply play video games for 4 hours and it won’t affect your grade that much.

This is where discipline comes in. Discipline isn’t about finding some inner motivation to propel you through the pain. Let’s be honest, you probably won’t feel that motivated until the night before the test.

What you can do today is willingly expose yourself to a counterintuitive, unpleasant, unrewarding activity at small scale.

Even 10-15 minutes will do.

The only condition is to do it at least three times a week. Yes, it will feel like a lose-lose situation. The good news is you *can* do it, and your tolerance will improve over time.

# If you’re tired

Let’s go over the basics that we consistently ignore:

If you spend most of your time staring at a screen, your eyes will feel tired and strained. If you do it too much, you might feel sleepy and fatigued; Let your eyes rest by taking a nap or looking at something in the distance for 10-20 minutes.

If you feel like you lack energy, go through this checklist:

* Did you drink any water in the last hour (not coffee, tea, or an energy drink)?
* Did you have a meal (not a snack) in the last three hours?
* Do you feel sleepy? Do you need to take a nap?
* Do you take basic vitamins to cover common deficiencies (Vitamin D, B12, A, E, C, Magnesium, Zinc, Iron,)? Did you take them today?
* Did you move at all in the last hour? Did you walk for at least five minutes in the last three hours?

# If you feel defeated or conflicted

**Catching up:**

Motivation and resilience are heavily dependent on framing. How you view failure and effort can either work for you or against you.

If you’re trying to catch up because you slacked off, you may want to compensate by studying hard for the next couple of days, right?

But let’s step back for a moment, how realistic is that? The difficult decision here is to let go of the dream for the perfect grade and start from where you are.

This is a lesson best learned early.

**Conflict:**

If you’re conflicted about your major or a specific class, or if you flunked a test and think it’s unfair that you have to study for it, maybe you’re jealous of how easily others get things done, and it feels unfair.

All these thoughts generate emotions, and those emotions influence your actions. Some will push you forward; others will hold you back.

Ask yourself:

* How do you view the situation you’re in?
* How do you feel about it?
* Does this help you study more or less? Why?
* How can you update your framing to become more motivated?

# If you don’t know how to study

Most of us learn in different ways, both directly and indirectly, through friends, parents, teachers, and so on.

People usually don’t stop to consider their own learning and studying process until it is either too late or when it gets too serious, with a direct impact on their life’s trajectory.

I want you to take a moment and ask yourself: **Have you learned or studied how to learn?**

There are excellent free courses out there that can teach you how to learn and study effectively. One that was popular back when I was in university was *Learning How to Learn* by Dr. Barbara Oakley.",5,1735583038.0,productivity,0,0.86,False
1hptp8m,https://i.redd.it/99dvv35g31ae1.png,UPDATE: Beyblade X 3ft Custom Stadium ,"I finally got my hands on a 3D printer and was able to test some variations of the X line and how the teeth would work and I finally have a model that works properly and smoothly with all the tips. I'm very sorry for those who have been waiting for updates but yea life and school have been my main focus. Besides that, the plate I'm printing on is only ~7x7in and if I were to print the stadium using that it would take forever and the pieces would be smaller. My plan now is to test the joints and connections of the pieces with this small printer and then either go to a print factory or find a bigger printer to use to make the final stadium. 

I just set up a GoFundMe (https://gofund.me/ec34512b) PLEASE DONT FEEL OBLIGATED TO DONATE!!!! I can't stress that enough! This fund is going to go straight into printing the stadium and testing. This is more of a ""buy-me-a-coffee"" donation that will go right back into what u see and as a reminder all the STL files will be available once I finish this! 

Thank you all for being patient with my progress but i just wanted to let yall know that I'm still working on it! I'll keep yall updated on my testings! ",3,1735583037.0,BeybladeX,0,0.72,False
1hptore,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1hptore/how_to_sit_down_and_study_for_hours/,How to sit down and study for hours,"Studying is a refined skill that takes time to cultivate, I want to explore with you the common obstacles that people face and what you can do about them.

# If It’s hard to digest:

One of the following reasons may behind why it’s hard for you to go through the material:

**It’s not well explained**:

Look for other sources for the topic you’re trying to learn. There are countless videos, free courses, and AI tools that can provide alternative explanations, which might make a concept click for you.

I studied engineering in the past, and some online videos taught the material better than some of my teachers, now ChatGPT can do it even better.

**You skipped the basics**:

If it feels like they’re speaking another language or you consistently go back and review previous definitions, concepts, rules, etc then you need to properly review the basics. You might think you’re saving time by skimming over things, but your brain needs a solid jumping-off point to connect the dots. Without that foundation, the material will feel like it’s slipping though your fingers.

Yes, I know, who wants to review the basics for the second, third, or fourth time, right?

**Lack of focus:**

Even the simplest concepts can be hard to understand if you’re not focused and present. You may think you’re focused, but it wouldn’t hurt to check.

How often do you get interrupted, and by what? If you can’t go a single hour without being interrupted, you need to address the cause of the disruption, try to minimize or get rid of noise, get your phone in another room.

Not being exposed to the stimulus is much easier than being exposed and resisting the impulse to give in.

You weren’t thinking about a pink elephant before reading this sentence but now try not to think about it.

# If it’s unpleasant:

Studying can sometimes feel like a lose-lose situation, you need to study for hours every day, ignore all the good and fun things around you, and barely make a dent in your grades, or you can simply play video games for 4 hours and it won’t affect your grade that much.

This is where discipline comes in. Discipline isn’t about finding some inner motivation to propel you through the pain. Let’s be honest, you probably won’t feel that motivated until the night before the test.

What you can do today is willingly expose yourself to a counterintuitive, unpleasant, unrewarding activity at small scale.

Even 10-15 minutes will do.

The only condition is to do it at least three times a week. Yes, it will feel like a lose-lose situation. The good news is you *can* do it, and your tolerance will improve over time.

# If you’re tired

Let’s go over the basics that we consistently ignore:

If you spend most of your time staring at a screen, your eyes will feel tired and strained. If you do it too much, you might feel sleepy and fatigued; Let your eyes rest by taking a nap or looking at something in the distance for 10-20 minutes.

If you feel like you lack energy, go through this checklist:

* Did you drink any water in the last hour (not coffee, tea, or an energy drink)?
* Did you have a meal (not a snack) in the last three hours?
* Do you feel sleepy? Do you need to take a nap?
* Do you take basic vitamins to cover common deficiencies (Vitamin D, B12, A, E, C, Magnesium, Zinc, Iron,)? Did you take them today?
* Did you move at all in the last hour? Did you walk for at least five minutes in the last three hours?

# If you feel defeated or conflicted

**Catching up:**

Motivation and resilience are heavily dependent on framing. How you view failure and effort can either work for you or against you.

If you’re trying to catch up because you slacked off, you may want to compensate by studying hard for the next couple of days, right?

But let’s step back for a moment, how realistic is that? The difficult decision here is to let go of the dream for the perfect grade and start from where you are.

This is a lesson best learned early.

**Conflict:**

If you’re conflicted about your major or a specific class, or if you flunked a test and think it’s unfair that you have to study for it, maybe you’re jealous of how easily others get things done, and it feels unfair.

All these thoughts generate emotions, and those emotions influence your actions. Some will push you forward; others will hold you back.

Ask yourself:

* How do you view the situation you’re in?
* How do you feel about it?
* Does this help you study more or less? Why?
* How can you update your framing to become more motivated?

# If you don’t know how to study

Most of us learn in different ways, both directly and indirectly, through friends, parents, teachers, and so on.

People usually don’t stop to consider their own learning and studying process until it is either too late or when it gets too serious, with a direct impact on their life’s trajectory.

I want you to take a moment and ask yourself: **Have you learned or studied how to learn?**

There are excellent free courses out there that can teach you how to learn and study effectively. One that was popular back when I was in university was *Learning How to Learn* by Dr. Barbara Oakley.",10,1735583001.0,Procrastinationism,0,1.0,False
1hpto6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1hpto6z/sun_princess_review_a_mixed_bag_of_experiences/,Sun Princess Review: A Mixed Bag of Experiences,"

The Sun Princess offers a visually appealing environment, but several key aspects of the onboard experience fell short of expectations, impacting overall enjoyment. While some elements shone, inconsistencies in service and design flaws detracted from the potential of this voyage.

**Dining Disappointments:** The main dining room (MDR) proved to be a significant area of concern. The quality of food was consistently mediocre, with a recurring issue of overcooked seafood, rendering it dry and rubbery. Furthermore, poultry dishes presented serious problems: one instance involved chicken served cold, while another was alarmingly undercooked, posing a health risk. Service in the MDR also lacked attentiveness, most notably with coffee service consistently arriving after desserts had been consumed, a frustrating oversight.

**Layout and Social Atmosphere:** The ship's layout presented a choppy and disjointed feel. Venues felt cramped and undersized, contributing to a sense of overcrowding, especially during peak hours. A major drawback was the lack of engaging nightlife catering to younger demographics (20-30 year olds). While the bars themselves offered a pleasant atmosphere and a decent selection of beverages, the severe lack of seating made it difficult to socialize and enjoy the spaces. This ultimately resulted in a subdued and underwhelming nighttime experience for this age group.

**Specialty Dining: A Bright Spot Marred by Reservation Woes:** The specialty dining options provided a welcome contrast to the MDR, offering high-quality cuisine and attentive service. However, the reservation system for these restaurants was frustratingly inefficient and poorly managed. Securing a reservation proved to be a cumbersome and often unsuccessful process, detracting from the overall positive experience these venues offered.

**Conclusion:** The Sun Princess presents a mixed bag. While the specialty dining and bar atmosphere showed promise, the subpar MDR experience, coupled with the ship's flawed layout and lack of appropriate nightlife, significantly impacted the overall cruise experience. Addressing the inconsistencies in food quality and service, along with rethinking the venue layout and entertainment offerings, is crucial for the Sun Princess to reach its full potential.",2,1735582962.0,PrincessCruises,9,0.63,False
1hptnlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1hptnlq/25_m_finally_found_a_career_path_but_im_still/,"25 M - Finally found a career path, but I'm still lonely and have no idea what to do with my life","**tldr**: I left a finance career I hated to become an EMT, which I love, but I've struggled to get cleared for 911 work and will try again in 6 months. Outside of work, I feel aimless—no dates, few hobbies, and difficulty socializing despite small efforts like hiking, writing, and striking up conversations with strangers. Likely neurodivergent and shaped by a tough childhood, I’m working to untangle my life and find direction.

**full post below**

I got a degree in finance at my parents' request. I worked in the field for 2 years at 3 jobs and hated it. I mean, it had it's moments,  but by and large it was awful. My last job I would go to the break room when no one was there and walk in circles around the break room table just to pass the time and I realized I can't do this for the next 40 years.

I signed up for an EMT program and loved it. I've been working in the field ever since. I actually get paid a really good wage considering most EMT's are impoverished, but the downside is that I work in a 911 system, but I've been cleared non emergent twice. The non emergent side of the business actually earns 6,000 dollars a year more, but I'd switch to 911 in a heartbeat. I just got cleared non emergent for the second time and I realized I was kinda banking a great deal of my identity and fulfillment on doing 911. The money is no good to me. It's supposed to be a year before I'm allowed to try again, but they're letting me try again in 6 months because they actually pulled me early the first time for re examination cause they thought I was ready. I guess so many people do EMS for free if you're gonna do it for a living wage it's like some major league shit.

I have 4 plans going forward into 2025.

Primary - do 6 months of non emergent, do re examination and pass.

Alternate - I'm going to start running 1.5 miles to and from work to train cardio and become a firefighter. Thing is, that's a 6 month hiring process in itself usually.

Contingency - I plan on starting a cleaning company. Call up apartments and warehouses and see if they need someone to clean things. I hear it's an easier business to start and I have 4 days off a week on account of working 3 14 hour shifts so why not. If  I can't be happy I may as well aim at being rich.

Emergency - If I fail re examination and those other 2 things, I think I'm going to request to work in the comms center at work. It's a pay raise, but it's basically being a dispatcher which isn't exciting or fun, but it is new experience in the 911 system.

I feel fortunate to know what I want to do with my life in EMS, but clearly I'm too much of a fuck up to actually do it. I used to do a lot of drugs, get into fights, and i don't really carry myself well. I think they see that in me. I am very friendly on a day to day basis, but I can tell many things I do even subconsciously rub people the wrong way. I got accused of opening doors aggressively cause I guess I'm just a big dumb brute

Thankfully outside of my career everything is fucked up too. I haven't been on a date in months and I don't really have any hobbies or many friends. I tried teaching myself the piano and right when I got into it, a key on the piano broke which was important for the song I was trying to learn. I genuinely don't know how to be a human being and socialize and meet people and do things. I have no interest in most things and I don't have any talent for the things I do want to do. Like seriously, it's so hard to explain, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do at all and I don't want to do anything at all.

I do work out pretty regularly and am pretty strong, hence why fire is an option, but outside of that I haven't really done anything consistently. I like going hiking, I hiked one of the tallest mountains in my state recently and that was awesome, but you can't do that super often really. I went to a museum recently too. I used to do martial arts, but stopped cause of injuries. I do enjoy writing, but that's a pretty solitary thing. Sometimes I go to coffee shops or concerts or bars or random events by myself. I've actually gotten kinda decent at striking up conversation with random women and they don't mind talking to me for a bit. like I'd say upwards of 80% of the time they're friendly and down for a chat. My go to line is ""Hey, you seem cool. Do you mind if I stop and chat for a second."" Then I try and get their socials at the end of the conversation if they show interest. Honestly I was shocked at how well this goes lol, but still not a single date from it.

I'm probably autistic and didn't really have the greatest childhood and I feel like it's had a drastic cascading effect on me even now. I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to unfuck myself from the way I was raised",1,1735582918.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

With my first, I NEVER craved anything sweet and was paranoid I would do something wrong so I cut out absolutely everything “not recommended” from my diet. I only ate stuff that was completely healthy and cut out coffee and soda and any extra treats and it wasn’t bad. 

This time, I want sugar all. The. Time. I don’t allow myself the chocolate bars I crave or the slices of cake, but since I’m so tired from chasing around my 9 month old I’ll start my morning with some kind of small iced latte from Starbucks every day with whole milk. After that I’ll have anywhere from 64-120oz of water during the entire day and I like to end my night with at most one can of coke, although usually I never finish it. 

I feel so guilty. I feel like allowing one sweet treat daily is okay and I’m obviously way less hard on myself with this pregnancy but I just end up craving the coke SO bad. I’m still eating healthy and those are the only extra added sugars I’ll allow myself but it’s still above the recommended limit if I have both. 

Pregnancy is just so miserable and it’s so nice having those things that make me happy and actually taste good, especially since my food aversions haven’t really left and I’m still choking down every meal. 

Overall I’ve always been a very healthy person, I’m extremely slender and live an active lifestyle and stay away from bad foods since we’re pretty crunchy and organic.

1hptjy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1hptjy2/my_constipation_is_ruining_my_life/,My constipation is ruining my life,"A few TW's before I star: long post, venting, ED mention, SH mention, slightly disgusting content, generally disturbing content

I was never good at summarising things, so this will be my best attempt: I've had a really bad eating disorder for over 15 years now. In 2021-2022, I lost a lot of weight thanks to starvation, excessive walking,  and occasional purging, and I developed anorexia. After starting my recovery, I was regular for little over a year. I gained a fraction of the weight back, which caused me to start starving myself again in May (I also purged for a while in April, but I lost a tooth because of it, so I stopped). It only took a month for my troubles with pooping to come back, but I kept it in check with laxatives the entire summer (2 Dulcolax taken after my final eating day).

In September, my ED took a turn for the worse, and I started excessively walking again. That, paired with not eating for 3-4 days in a row (I still drink 2 coffees during the day and chamomile tea with lemon and honey before going to bed), worsened my constipation. In October, I didn't have many troubles cause I started taking chia seeds with yogurt on every day that I eat, and it worked wonders for a month. In November, despite eating enough fibre, drinking enough water, and moving even more than I should, my constipation only became worse. By the end of November, I had lost the ability to shit on my own, and could only do it by taking laxatives.

The problem is that I always have severe panic attacks when I don't poop. The mere thought of shit being stuck inside of me drives me insane. I don't have the luxury of eating every day, so I have to get rid of it before I start starving and walking again. It is certainly tied to my anxiety and BPD, but these episodes are unbearable. I scream and shout and shake, and even hurt myself (cutting, punching myself, punching walls and closets with my fists) until I lose all my energy and fall into a catatonic state. I repress my emotions all the time, and not pooping is my biggest trigger (technically only trigger, cause I've eliminated all the other ones from my life), and I just lose all control when that happens. Everything that's been building up in me, all the negative emotions, all the pain and misery, all the overthinking, it all comes out during these fits. These episodes always happen no matter how hard I try to keep them from happening, causing immense stress to both me and my Mother.

As things got worse last month, and as I was severely traumatised from these constipation episodes, I started starving myself even more, for 5-6 days in a row. As of today, I've only eaten for 7 days this entire month (1st, 7th, 14th, 19th, 21st, and this last weekend). To make things worse, I'm not even thin, just... normal. I was chubby during the summer, but I've slimmed down a bit in the past 3 months. Still, it's an abnormally low amount of lost weight, considering how much I starve and walk. My metabolism is extremely slowed down, meaning that eating every day would lead to weight gain, so I can't do it. I have to keep starving myself and prolonging my misery. My blood work came back showing I'm close to developing problems with my kidneys and liver (low urea, high bilirubin), but my doctor wrote me off by telling me she won't refer me anywhere else because they'll just tell me to eat to fix my health problems. She's right, but it pains me to know that, if I had come to her 10-15 kilograms lighter, she'd fight tooth and nail to help me.

I know it's unrealistic to expect that I'll have a bowel movement despite my chaotic eating disorder, but at least I could always count on laxatives. The 2 Dulcolax would always flush me out, but 10 days ago, even they stopped working. Last Monday, I had to use a suppository. I was so frustrated with everything and decided to allow myself to eat for 2 days in a row (the past weekend). Figured I deserved some rest, peace and quiet. Boy, oh boy, was that a mistake. I thought I could deal with not shitting on Sunday, but I had several episodes on that day alone. The fact that Dulcolax stopped working completely destroyed me. It's the strongest laxative available in the country I live in, and I have no access to Miralax or any of the other laxatives I've seen mentioned on this subreddit. It was my last hope, since I hate using suppositories and enemas (also have access only to water enemas), cause they never leave me feeling satisfied. In the past few months, I also developed a nasty habit of manually removing faeces from my rectum, cause I can't stand all the painful straining without producing anything. I know it only makes things worse, but the thought of stool being stuck inside of me makes me feel so anxious. I think I fucked something up with this method, cause I often get the urge to poop but I can't produce anything, or I just fart.

I've read a lot about faecal impaction, bowel obstruction and all that jazz, and I'm always living in fear of that happening to me. I know it's only a matter of time before the suppositories stop working, too. I took 2 Dulcolax around 3am last night, and had a bowel movement this morning and some diarrhea after it. But that's only the food I ate on Saturday, everything I ate yesterday is still inside of me. I took another 3 Dulcolax around 12pm, just 15 minutes before my bowel movement. I have a feeling they won't work, and then I'll worry about the remaining stool in my colons hardening, cause I can't eat anything before Saturday, so there's nothing that could push it out. I took some senna tea in the evening, but senna has only worked once for me, and I was on my period then, so I suspect it had more to do with my uterus cramping than the senna itself. But I don't want to take a suppository or an enema, cause they just further damage my bowels. I hate enemas, cause the one time I used it, it only made me feel awful and I didn't even poop out anything solid, it was just watery diarrhea. I can't say I'm losing my mind, cause I lost it a long time ago, but god... I was already a mess even before this, and I'm just wondering what did I ever do to deserve this, as if I didn't have enough problems to begin with. Last night, I saw someone post about their colostomy bag, and after seeing what it is, I'm scared out of my mind that that's how I'll end up. I'm just venting, cause there's no advice anyone could give me that I don't already know. I know what I'm doing is wrong, I know that I'm only making things worse by keeping this up, I know what I should technically do to better my bowel movements, but I just can't do it. ""Eat every day"" is not an option, so I'm genuinely fucked, cause no amount of life changes or laxatives will help me when I eat once or twice a week. It will only get worse from here on out, and I don't know how much longer I can do this. I was already teetering on the edge for the past year after my last suicide attempt on New Years, and now... I just want to be free of this. The starving, the walking, the guilt I feel every time I eat, the pain in my body, the anxiety, the episodes... I did all of this to myself, and it was all for nothing. I've permanently destroyed my body and mind and bowels, and there's no coming back from it... I don't even have the option of looking for help, cause there's no treatment for eating disorders around here, especially if you're not underweight. Not to mention I have other mental health issues as well, and I'm no longer young enough for any treatment to work. So yeah, I'm doomed.

Anyways, if anyone made it all the way through, thank you. This is obviously a throwaway account, cause I don't want the most intimate details of my life to be tied to my regular account. I don't know how to finish this off... I guess I can just say that I sincerely hope things are better for you.",7,1735582661.0,Constipation,2,1.0,False

1hptipw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/1hptipw/how_do_i_make_myself_healthy/,How do I make myself healthy? ,"I have been married for 6 years and have a 2 year old daughter. I am a SAHM for the last three years and I am tired every single day taking care of our toddler 24/7. What's even more tiring is that my husband doesn't help and I take care of all the household chores too. After coming from office and later gym, he spends around 20 minutes with our daughter and goes to another room to talk with friends and chill. He has a perfect health condition and body. He works out every single day in gym while I meal prep and take care of everything around the house. I have slowly started to see that he is thriving in life( both career and physical) while my health declines as I am tired all the time. I drink two-three cups of coffee everyday. How do I make myself healthy? I am not overweight. However, Going to the gym to start working out is not an option for me as I can't drop off my daughter at daycare while I workout. In my country, there is no gym daycare. My husband also won't help in any childcare, so I am thinking to do cardio at home 3 times a week. What other ways to get myself healthy? What vitamins am I lacking to be this tired? ",1,1735582574.0,ask,4,1.0,False
1hpti3o,https://i.redd.it/9zo0yuxx11ae1.jpeg,Unique Bday ideas in SF? ,"Hi! I’m turning 23 on January 10th and I’m trying to find unique things to do in SF or close by(Berkeley, oakland, etc.) I enjoy: animal activities/encounters, adventurous activities (no hiking, I don’t enjoy that unfortunately), thrifting (cheap real thrift stores, not curated vintage stores or Buffalo Exchanges etc. ) , eating, spas, makeup, musicals and shows, coffee, arts and crafts, and anything unique and fun! 

Here are some things I’ve already done in SF and in general:

-Westwood Bull riding 

-Japanese Tea Gardens 

-Exploratorium 

-Academy of Science 

-All of the Goodwills, Salvation army’s, Out of the Closets, SF Goodwills bins, St Vincent De Paul, Community Thrift 

-Japantown 

-China town 

-Little Italy food tour 

-SF zoo 

-MOMA 

-Ferry Building 

-Golden Gate bridge walk 

-Alcatraz 

-Cable Cars 

- that arcade that’s all vintage games 

-4D experience at pier 39

- Tcho Chocolate factory tour 

- painting pottery 

-Ripleys believe it or not museum 

-Haight Ashbury (thrifting, eating, walking etc.) 



And some things I don’t really want to do:

-Wine tasting 

-hiking 

-huge crowds and really loud music 

- I drink occasionally but usually only fancy fruity cocktails

-Most Museums (I like some but more of the interactive ones)

- watching sports games ",0,1735582531.0,sanfrancisco,17,0.43,False
1hpthv7,https://www.facebook.com/share/g/18VsRinZWg/?mibextid=wwXIfr,Looking for Local Artists to Connect & Create,"I’m hoping to put together a group of artists to meet up about once a month to create art, share feedback, and inspire each other. I’ve done a lot of this online, but I’d love to spend some time in person with like-minded folks in the area.

Think of it like a “stitch ’n’ bitch” for artists, meeting up at the library community room, coffee shops, breweries, or even checking out galleries and museums together from time to time. Casual, fun, and low-pressure!

I’m looking at evenings and weekends to keep things flexible.

If this sounds like something you’d be into, I’ve started a Facebook group and instagram to gauge interest and organize meetups. Drop a comment or join the group if you’re interested—I’d love to hear from you!",2,1735582514.0,DelawareFriendship,2,1.0,False

Having primary 4*4*1.6 CM tumour in buccal mucosa & secondary 3*3 cm tumour in right lung. He previously suffered from heart attack and had done angioplasty, his heart is also very weak. 

Currently he isn’t able to eat anything solid and barely surviving on protein shakes, fruit juices, cold coffee, milk with boost etc. Just 2 months ago he had 0 signs of any kind of physical distress & it went downhill very quickly from there. First he stopped eating solid food a month ago complaining about ulcers in mouth, we went to ENT and he asked us to get biopsy done, took us few days as he had to stop his blood thinners , biopsy came back a week ago with poorly differentiated SCC, pet scan showed mets to lungs… we are going to his oncologist tomorrow to get his treatment plan. 

Currently he is suffering from extreme pain due to Jaw bone invasion by oral cancer, his O2 stats are down to 92 & have slight trouble breathing due to lung condition. He isn’t even able to hold a cup of coffee due to weakness & muscle wasting as not being able to eat much in past few weeks. 

Doctors are saying he doesn’t look well enough for chemotherapy let alone operation. Sorry i am just ranting feeling completely helpless, i wish there was something i could do… fuck cancer. ",6,1735582436.0,cancer,4,1.0,False
1hptg15,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hptg15/the_bright_forest/,The Bright Forest,"Humanity has always longed for the stars. From simple cave dwellers, who looked at the luminous disc of the Milky Way in awe, to the first astronauts soaring beyond the safe embrace of Earth’s atmosphere, they always held a profound meaning. It was no different at the dawn of interstellar travel, when humanity’s lasting desire to see those other shining spheres up close, far away from the warmth of Sol, was finally realized. These pioneers discovered many great and wondrous things on those distant worlds. Some were similar to Earth and provided new colonies for the fledgling domain of humanity, others were utterly alien, yet no less astonishing.

Resources and new materials, adventure and enterprise were all in abundance, but one thing was missing. Neighbors. From the early radio signals and the Voyager probes to quantum communication and the fully automated Pickett-system, the search for companionship never ceased. Thousands of foreign planets were surveyed, a lot of them settled, but outside of simple vegetation and animals no alien life was found, nobody to hold a conversation with.

The silence was deafening, and the scientific consensus came to the disheartening conclusion that humanity was alone, its evolution, or creation for the more religious types, was a one-of-a-kind event in the universe. Soon after the experts reached this conclusion, alien ruins were found. Archaeologists, engineers, and the like descended on those ancient remnants like vultures, ravenous to uncover their secrets.

The jubilation was tempered by the revelation that this foreign culture did not go out in its sleep, as a culmination of a long decline; it met a violent end. The marks of heavy weaponry scarred the face of the arid world from pole to pole. Curiously, it seemed the aliens did not fight back against their attackers, they laid down and accepted their fate without struggle. Or were there no invaders, have they decided to end it all themselves?

This finding sparked a new rush of exploration, manned and remote-controlled vessels reached for ever-distant stars, and they uncovered many more ruins. Evidence of ancient civilizations that once inhabited them lingered, but no surviving sapient lifeforms were discovered. Strangely enough, the older these structures were, the more desperately their long-gone owners tried to defend them, with the most antique of these sites being reduced to nothing more than cataclysmic battlefields.

Dark suspicions arose, but the mystery remained. Had an ancient galactic civilization destroyed itself in the frenzy of war, something humanity was intimately familiar with, or was something cruel and violent stalking out in the dark? The search continued despite calls for caution, the treasures scavenged, technologies salvaged from these derelicts were far too valuable. During the excavation of a half-destroyed megastructure, a device was accidentally activated. The next day humanity received the much-awaited first message from the long-sought neighbors. ""Hide.""

There was somebody out there! Well, no. There were at least *two* types of somebodies out there… It cannot be said that humanity lived in an era of undisturbed peace, piracy, small-scale skirmishes between planets and similar sorts of internecine squabbles were a regular part of life, but no one was ready for a war of interstellar proportions. Exploratory missions were halted, navies and militaries bolstered, and there was an eerie disquiet as if an entire species held its collective breath. Nobody seemed to understand that 'hide' did not mean 'make ready'…

They came. Massive ships struck the newly founded colonies on the outer reaches, and from them savage, monstrous aliens poured out, seeking nothing but destruction. Diplomacy was attempted, but the only answer was mocking cackle, the aliens spoke the language of war alone. The first battles ended in complete disaster for the defenders, their enemies were far more advanced. Their technologies anyway, the wanton horrors they unleashed on their path of rampage revealed them to be nothing more than locusts. Even worse, for the insects only sought to satiate their hunger.

Humanity was young, fierce, and far more adaptable than their foes, and the aliens were surprised they even had to wage a proper war, their insolent prey refusing to lie down on the ground like their predecessors. Still, worlds burned, fleets were ravaged and desperation pervaded the hearts of the newest victims of those who haunted the stars. Humanity braced for total war under this brand new evolutionary pressure, their best minds searching for ways to overcome the odds. Vicious and destructive weapons were created and thrown at the cosmic locusts in vain, until in an obscure, unremarkable system a small victory was achieved.

The setback didn’t make a dent in the overall might of the ravaging aliens, the human admirals knew their fortunes weren’t reversed. Victory, even the hope of survival remained but a fever dream. However, propaganda milked the unexpected triumph for all its worth, reports and videos sang about the heroes of that ultimately inconsequential battle. The message that the enemy can be defeated went, flew, to all the distant stars that could be reached through radio waves or quantum comms.

The locusts were shocked by their defeat, and it drove them into a frenzy. They lunged at the lynchpin of human defenses, hungry for blood and intent on finally breaking the spirit of their prey. The humans received them in that fortress system, fighting for all their worth, their new weapons giving ever-nastier surprises to the invaders. Experimental tactics and half-mad inventions were deployed, nothing was too outlandish to try and turn the tide.

The locusts on the other hand, countless millennia of undisputed battlefield mastery led them down a path of hubris and stagnation. Their evolutionary journey was a downward spiral ever since their victims gave up hope and stopped fighting back, and now their ossified structures prevented them from adapting to the changing circumstances. They were certain that it did not matter, desperate tricks would not stop their ancient might and superior forces, and the upstart apes would end up just like the rest, a footnote in history, they thought, assured their zero-sum philosophy would triumph again.

The long and bloody drama of the human fortress was nearing its end, valor and wit had to bow before the aliens’ insurmountable might. Their grisly ships were besieging the last line of defense when something unfathomable happened. Sleek silver vessels arrived at the far edge of the system. Crude blue ones followed them, then a few iridescent greens, then differently shaped silvers, and many others. The united fleets struck the locusts with millennia of unbridled fury, some seeking vengeance for their lost kin and home, others raging against the darkness that forced them to hide in terror for so long. Humanity, the scrubby new kid on the street dared to hit back at the dreadful bully, drew his blood, and the facade of invincibility shattered; prompting the others to join in on the fun, ganging up on their oppressor.

The siege was broken, the locusts fled reeling, but it was just the first, well, second victory in a long campaign of liberation and retribution. The many races that came out of hiding to finally bask in the light tentatively reached out to one another. 

There was a star map at the Navy HQ, a vast chart outlining communications between systems. A few hundred tiny bulbs burned on the black wall, designating all known inhabited worlds. Suddenly a new shine joined the others, a new connection was established. Then another, and another, hundreds, thousands more flared up, until the officer hugging his fourth coffee of the night had to cover his eyes as he slipped past the door, the brilliance behind him shattering the darkness.",14,1735582385.0,HFY,2,0.9,False
1hptf6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingApps/comments/1hptf6y/am_i_crazy_or_is_2_weeks_long_enough/,Am I crazy or is 2 weeks long enough?,"We match! I ask her basic questions about where she's from, interested in (dating), hobbies, lifestyle, and point out stuff we have in common. And this is it after 2 weeks of matching (on Tinder, Hinge, Boo, Bumble, or whatever). Overall, she always took a few days to respond but still responded, so...

Me:
""Do you wanna go on a date? I know a good [spot] open this weekend.""

Her reply: 
""I'd rather get to know you more on the app first. After that, I'd love to go out with you.""

If you couldn't tell by my tone already, this isn't what I wanted to hear. I've heard this so often, and sometimes I go for it, but most times it doesn't go anywhere because she doesn't add anything and . So I told her

""I'm not gonna keep messaging for another 2 weeks at this pace. But if there's anything else you wanna know before meeting me, take all the time you need and ask away. No pressure.""

And we're both from Texas (not Austin) and I was raised traditionally. So I already know how ""she has to worry about her safety,"" ""some people don't like to rush,"" and ""I'm not owed... yadayadayada."" I'm a regular guy who’s tired of apps, not Ted Bundy lying in wait.


GET TO  THE  POINT;

So I'm just asking if I was being reasonable in my last quoted response? Also, was she being fair or did I save myself a headache?


Sidenotes:

We're both of similar age (mid 20s) and live in the same area (~15 miles apart).

Also [spot] is in brackets because I don't want to get sidetracked defending  [restaurant] or [coffee shop] or [activity]. Also, it was a public area.

And I don't care that guys are flaky too. That doesn't do anything for me. I'm a guy who's looking for a girl. ",1,1735582326.0,DatingApps,14,0.67,False
