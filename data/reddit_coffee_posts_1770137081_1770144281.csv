The games you want from me must be redeemed soon. I can't vouch for a key's validity when you keep it stored for longer without redeeming. One of the reasons why: Some Game Developers had started to revoke unused keys some time after their expiration date. Sadly, this seems to turn into a growing trend with game keys.

1qv0bb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1qv0bb0/nausea_and_anxiety_during_ultrasound/,Nausea and anxiety during ultrasound,"I just got back from my 21 week anatomy scan. About 20 minutes into the scan I started feeling like maybe I was having a panic attack, I got a cold sweat over my body and an extremely nauseous feeling. I told the OB that I had to pee and I really needed to use the restroom so I slowly walked to the bathroom. I was so dizzy that when I got into the bathroom, I kind of collapse near the toilet and just started puking. I sat there for a minute to catch my breath and then got up and went to the sink and splashed cold water on my face. After about 10 minutes in the bathroom, I came back in and told her that I wasn’t feeling well so she told me to try and sit up a little bit and drink some water. Once I started feeling a bit better, we continued with the scan.

Since I couldn’t really calm down, we didn’t get to finish so I have to go back in two weeks to finish my scan. Has anyone else been through this? I’m trying to think of how I can make things better for next time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

For context, I am 33 this is my first pregnancy. I had a few sips of coffee and a breakfast sandwich from Starbucks right before I got there. I am also diagnosed with GAD for anxiety and panic attacks and am not currently on any meds during my pregnancy but I’m unsure if that’s what happened.

It is very likely that I will probably go out shopping and buy a bunch of shit that I don’t need but that I want.

Regardless of what day of the week my 30th birthday falls on that day and the next several days will be called off from work.

There’s going to be a dinner at a fancy restaurant, the boys will all be shined up in their finest suits, bringing their ladies with them, we will laugh, toast, and eat and drink to memories of the past.

And hopefully I’ll have a date of my own.

Now my Question is, I went to the pharmacy a couple days ago and somehow said im anxious etc, and she gave me a 25mg Sildenafil generic 

Im not sure weather to take it or not and weather it will help me or not, I mean Im already a hypochondriac etc and suffer from mild palpitations after a heavy meal or after not sleeping or after coffee etc,but I went to the cardiologist 2 times past 2 years and he did an echo and ekg and nothing wrong was found

So I dont know is this safe to take , what do u guys say, and any experience with 25mg. Il just use it as a crutch to get over this thats bothering me.",1,1770143979.0,erectiledysfunction,1,1.0,False

As it stands, I am convinced that everyone involved with the creation of this mutant monstrosity from the chairman of Sony all the way down to the wage-slave who makes the coffee at Sony Towers should be lined up against a wall and sharply criticised. 

Like numerous other people, my Bravia (non)Connect app will be working perfectly fine one minute, and then abruptly decide that the soundbar has disappeared from our dimension, never to be reached again. 

Cue the usual Sony Taken-For-A-Mug dance of resetting everything, the turning off and on of everything, the reinitialising and the oath-swearing never to buy anymore Sony nonsense again, and eventually the app will remember that Thanos didn't finger-snap my Theatre Bar 6 out of existence and that it is six feet away.

Yay.

o   a sore thoat

o   headaches

o   fatigue

o   coughing

o   shortness of breath

o   general weakness

i still managed to get my things done i finished school and university with great succes even though its been really hard due to the long covid.

two months ago i started a new job i was really looking for. its an office job so i sit a lot and look at my screens.

quickly i noticed that my neck hurts a lot due to that long sitting even though my posture and all positions are correct.

it started with chronic neck pain and now i get episodes of massive fatigue and dizziness after drinking a coffee.

that was completely new to me so i stopped drinking coffee as i thought it was the trigger.

two days ago i woke up, went to work and felt generally fine. but after two hours at work it felt like someone shut me off completely like these episodes after coffee.

since this happened i have really bad brainfog and also a slight headache and still neckpain. i am unable to work since i cant concentrate or drive a car anymore.

did anyone ecperience this similar to my story?

is my sickness getting worse or is it the neck pain that makes the brain fog and the dizziness? i have so many questions.

im scared that my neurological symptoms got so much worse.

maybe you could let me know if you also got worse symptomes during your sickness or if anyone had to deal with their neck like me??

thank you in advance and lets stay strong!",1,1770143906.0,covidlonghaulers,0,1.0,False

Went to a night club in a neighboring town 45 minutes away and was last seen leaving the club alone after 12:30. She was not intoxicated. Her car was tagged the next morning by law enforcement officials along the side of I-20 with her purse still in it.  
  
It’s reported that her seat was pushed all the way back, as if she wasn’t the one driving it.  
  
Brandi was just weeks away from starting classes again at Trinity Valley Community College in Brownsboro, Texas. She wanted to become a teacher.  
  
But first, she visited her mother in Tyler, Texas. On the evening of August 2, she went out to meet some friends. “She came in, she changed clothes, and said she was going to the club with some friends,” Brandi’s mother, Ellen Tant, told [NBC affiliate KETK](https://www.ketk.com/news/special-reports/vanished/vanished-brandi-wells/). She assumed Brandi was going somewhere in town. Little did she know that Brandi was heading to Longview, about 45 minutes away.  
  
According to KETK, security footage shows Brandi entering a nightclub called Graham Central Station on McCann Road – now Electric Cowboy – around 10:36 p.m. and checking in at the counter. People inside would later tell police that Brandi was asking for money for gas. She was inside the club for nearly two hours and was seen on tape walking alone out toward the parking lot around 12:30 a.m.  
  
According to KETK, Brandi’s purse and a gas can her family believed did not belong to her were found in the trunk. They also reported that the driver’s side seat of the car had been adjusted for someone taller than Brandi, but because it took days to link the car to her disappearance, authorities didn’t know if that happened before or after the car was abandoned.  
  
Brandi was around 5’ tall and weighed 125-130 lbs. at the time of her disappearance, with blonde or strawberry-blonde hair and blue eyes. She would be 42 years old today.  
  
Police suspect she is a murder victim but there is no direct evidence tying that assumption to a murder aside from her being missing since 2006  
  
If you have any information about Brandi’s disappearance, please contact the Longview Police Department at 903-237-1199

She had arrived with her fuel tank almost at empty and was asking people for gas money. She was not intoxicated. There is surveillance video indicating she left the club alone.  
  
Wells’ car was found abandoned the next day by a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper along Interstate 20 about 300 yards west of FM 2087 with her purse still inside the vehicle. Her car had front passenger damage above the front wheel. Longview police didn’t identify the car as belonging to Wells until five days later. There were no signs of a struggle. Wells’ cellphone was found later at another location.

I’ve been working here for almost two years. It’s a kind of stressful job but it pays well and everyone is nice (aside from like one guy) and I like it. My boss is REALLY nice. He brings in donuts every monday, he comes from his office a few times a day to just like check in with everyone. Pretty much every morning he asks if I slept well or had a good breakfast. 

He has graying temples and a tummy and crow’s feet and a beard that is really well groomed. Salt and pepper yknow. He smells like good smoky cologne and he dresses like one of those dark academia mood boards. But he wears stupid socks with random shit on them and colorful ties too, so he’s not like intimidating.

He’s really hands on. It’s a problem. He likes to drag me around by the arm instead of just tell me where to go, and every time he comes over to see what i’m working on or if I need help, he puts his hand on my shoulder. Or the back of my neck. Hello HR (joking obviously.) And then I have to sit at my desk for a while because I can’t get up due to reasons.

Sometimes he has to put on his little thin framed glasses and I have to fucking leave. 

He doesn’t have a wedding ring but he has a faint indent on his finger so I have no idea if he’s married. Never talks about wife or kids but who knows.

AI was having car problems a while ago and didn’t really have a reliable way to get to work, so for like a month he picked me up and dropped me off everyday because I was on his route anyway. And he didn’t let me pay him gas money. And his car has a CD player and he likes 70s rock but also Slipknot. He let me borrow CDs to listen to. I don’t even have a CD player. My car is working again but I miss going with him. 

He has expensive cigars but he doesn’t light them, he just likes the taste, he quit smoking when he was in his thirties. 

He calls me kid and I really shouldn’t like it but I do.

He felt bad when he found out he missed my birthday and offered to buy me a coffee. So we went across the road during lunch break and he bought me my favorite coffee in a size large (I only buy small because large is like $12) and a bunch of danishes and donuts too. So I offered to share because he was eyeing them and they were expensive, and then we sat and drank coffee and ate little treats and he told me all about his pet fish and I really want him to do very intense things to me.

I blush really obviously but he never says anything. One of my coworkers caught on on like day 2 and she likes to torture me about it. I’m pretty sure he’s overheard her teasing but again, not a word about it

I’m going to fucking implode. ",1,1770143698.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Hoping that other AuDhd women in this sub will understand my problem, and not think I'm totally crazy : /   
  
I know I need to consume more protein in my diet, but I have a very hard time eating it. Whether it's b/c the texture of meat, beans, or eggs suddenly becomes disgusting, or b/c I'm overwhelmed and exhausted to actually cook food. I often end my day with very little protein in my system. I know this impacts tons of things (energy, mood, etc.) so I am trying hard to find a good alternative to make sure I get enough protein daily. 

Here's my main issue: I have a very sensitive taster and despise most forms of added sugar and flavorings. I have a strong sweet tooth, so I know I will need something sweet in order to be consistent with it. I do best with chocolate or coffee flavor, but I am caffeine sensitive so I know the latter sadly won't work if it has caffeine. Anything other than good ole sugar cane tastes like poison to me (dramatic, but true). That means any of the artificial sweeteners are out (Aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet); Saccharin (Sweet'N Low); Sucralose (Splenda); Acesulfame Potassium (Ace-K) -- honestly don't know wtf that last one is....). I have tried to force myself to consume anything with stevia or monk fruit, but they leave a terrible after taste in my mouth which triggers my sensory overwhelm. 

TL;DR: I am looking for a chocolate flavored protein drink or powder that has minimal and quality ingredients and that uses regular sugar to sweeten it.

If any of y'all have recs or even recs on where to go to ask this question (lol) I'd be hugely grateful!!! ",1,1770143569.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1qv00y5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qv00y5,AIO to my bridesmaids behavior surrounding my wedding day,"I got married a few months ago. I didn’t have any “requirements” for my bridesmaids but asked each of them to stay at the hotel the night of rehearsal and wedding so at least a year in advanced from my wedding date. My one bridesmaid, let’s call her Claire, complained to me about the price of the hotel when I brought up that I’d like for her to stay there. I was a little annoyed at this since Claire and her husband are rich and it was my only ask as a bridesmaid, but she booked the hotel and didn’t say anything about it after complaining to me about the price. She did use the block room code and I know this because the hotel sent me a list of the people who used it. 

Fast forward it’s the week of my wedding. The hotel sent me a finalized list of people who used my room block code. Claire and her husband we were not on the list. I texted her asking if she was still planning to stay at the hotel, to which she replied yes, my husband must’ve just used a code from work.

Now, my rehearsal dinner. One of my friends joked about being Claire’s date and I said what about her husband? And she snapped at me in front of all our friends at the table saying “I told you he isn’t coming he is sick” and I just replied “oh okay I didn’t realize”. She did tell me he was sick about 3 days before the rehearsal dinner but did not say he would be unable to attend the wedding. I avoided talking to her most of that night due to our interactions earlier that night. I asked her what room she was staying in when she left the rehearsal and she told me she didn’t know because she didn’t check in yet, she needed to go home to grab some things first. Come to find later that night my other bridesmaid said she asked Claire for a ride to the venue the next day and told Claire she could meet her at her hotel room, Claire said that’s ok I will just pull my car up to the front. After Claire left the rehearsal, some of the wedding party was hanging out. We began talking about her and I was ended up asking him if Claire was staying at the hotel and he said no. I checked her location that night and she was at home. The next day she texted me asking if I need anything because she stopped back home in the morning to get some things. I said if she had orange juice for mimosas and she said she doesn’t but can stop at the store. At this point I was really frustrated about the whole situation, but decided not to bring it up because I wanted to keep the peace that day in order to focus on one of the biggest days of my life with my now husband. I talked to her while getting ready (definitely less than typical) but included her in group conversations. We got ready with the rest of my bridesmaids and took pictures before the ceremony and reception.

At the reception, as my husband and I went around to tables to say hi, as soon as I went up to her she immediately asked if I was mad at her. I asked if she was staying at the hotel and she said no, she didn’t feel safe because a guy who has attempted to pursue her while married lives close by. I said that’s fine I just wish you were honest with me and she said she thought it was the best choice not to tell me at the time. At that point, I thought we were cool. We danced together on the dance floor and I had a great night. At the end of the reception, some of the bridal party and family stayed to clean up. Everyone was driving except my husband and I, and we were going to take the shuttle. She kept insisting we go with her, I was drunk and agreed because I just didn’t feel like arguing. On the ride back to the hotel for the after party she was asking me if I was still mad and her and wanted to talk about it and I said I’m just trying to enjoy the rest of my night I don’t want to talk about this now. I come to find out later she went down to the after party as my husband and I were changing and she told one of my best friends how mad I am at her. The next day we had a breakfast, I talked to her about other stuff, everything seemed fine. She asked if she could call me that week. 

She calls me and I’m ngl I was expecting an apology, and I would’ve accepted it. Instead she starts going on and on about how I was demoralizing to her on my wedding day, I iced her out all day and she wants to know what I was trying to get out of it. Finally she tells me she has no good memories of me on my wedding day. She said she didn’t tell me about feeling unsafe because I wouldn’t have understood, that she did so much for me that day and I treated her horribly just for not staying at the hotel. After that conversation I couldn’t sleep, I felt bad that she thought I felt that way. So I texted her the next morning saying the conversation didn’t go as I expected, I’m sorry I hurt her, I need some space and time to think. After a few days I called her and she is still upset with me for being upset. I wrote out everything I wanted to say to her, told her I was only trying to protect my peace that day and I’m sorry I didn’t think about how it would affect her. To me, it wasn’t just about her lying about the hotel but how she treated me for being upset about it and everything else. Her apologizing was just saying sorry I thought it was the best thing to do at the time. Nothing else. We both apologized, made up, and decided to get dinner a few days later. At dinner I kind of realized I was forcing this friendship and I truly don’t feel like she is a good friend. I saw her once in a group since then and we were amicable. She texted me two times in the past month saying she hasn’t heard from me, we casually talked and I have been polite. Then this week she asked if I wanted to get coffee. I am still hurt about what happened and tried to communicate with her. Below is her response, she also unshared her location with me. I truly don’t want to talk about what happened anymore, I hate that this entire situation which wasn’t a huge deal to me on that day turned into this and that she feels like she can push me around without taking true accountability. Up until this most recent conversation I was willing to see her in a group setting, but didn’t see myself being close to her again like we used to be. 

TLDR: I caught my bridesmaid in a lie, was upset with her. She the was upset with me and told me she has no good memories on my wedding day, I iced her out, and was demoralizing to her. I don’t know if I’m overreacting to the entire situation and made a big deal out of something that could have been avoided. ",1,1770143479.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

""The vast majority of his announcements can be essentially boiled down to “Ha! Star Trek reference!” while the show nudges you with the auditory reminder that yes, Stephen Colbert is a beloved, high-profile nerd, and even he’s getting excited to talk about Klingon coffee and whatnot. But it just feels cheap in a show that is otherwise not only jam-packed with those references all over its background already but also, by and large, engages with them in a much more deft manner.

Starfleet Academy is, understandably, a show deeply interested in the legacy of what Star Trek has been for 60 years now, not just in its place as the new Star Trek show coming out during that anniversary year, but also because it is about nurturing a brand-new generation of Starfleet’s future in the wake of a galaxy-shattering event.

Sometimes it plays with it with a sense of silliness, sure—like framing Starfleet’s historical duality as a scientific and military organization through a schoolyard prank war—but for the most part, as it approaches things from the perspective of its young protagonists, it is a series that, even in these early stages, **wants to try and advance Star Trek forward, to engage with ideas and questions the franchise has had for generations before it. That is in and of itself referential** , but it’s a referential nature that goes deeper than simply pointing and acknowledging.

Admittedly, part of the joy of Starfleet Academy and Star Trek in general is that these two particular beasts of reverence can co-exist. But that’s not going to stop me from gritting my teeth the next time Colbert comes over the intercom any time soon.""

1quzp1p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1quzp1p,Turkish Coffee,"Hello Everyone!

I have lurked this subreddit for close to 15 years. Hard to say since I don’t recall when r/quilting was created. 

I wanted to share a personal journey here surrounding a quilt I made. It took over two years to complete and helped me realize who I was again. 

I was living in a seriously abusive situation when a new roommate moved in. This new roommate was experiencing a hard break up and we talked a lot. He was also a veteran. I was experiencing marriage to a fentanyl addict, no support system, and the death of my father. 

While I was working a summer job at a fabric store I learned about Kaffe Fassett. At first, I did not appreciate the bold colors and designs as I was more of an 1800s reproduction enthusiast. One day we received a new pattern book called “Quilts in Burano”. I bought the book with my employee discount and took it home. 

While perusing the designs my roommate asked if he could look at it. He flipped through the whole book until he came across “Turkish Coffee”. He quite literally gasped and said, “This looks like the jingle trucks in Afghanistan!”

He started going on and on about the jingle trucks and how much he missed that part of his deployment. Like many people, when deployed to a foreign land they were traumatized by what they went through but still managed to fall in love with the culture. I included a photo of what a jingle truck looks like.

I made a mental note as his reaction is exactly what I would look for when it came to making a custom quilt. I soon spoke to his mother, who had the same idea I did. Make the quilt in secret and give it to my dear friend. 

I slowly began buying the fabric, I managed to get most of it but as you know, Kaffe doesn’t stick around very long because it’s actually quite beautiful and unique, so I had to substitute some prints. 

Time passed, I would put the quilt away when I didn’t have the mental energy. I lost the energy because my addict husband started using my craft room to shoot up and smoke fent. I withdrew from friends and family. I withered away inside and out. 

My roommate suddenly moved out. The house was toxic and volatile. He had enough to deal with after three tours. 

We tried to stay friends. He and his mom came over for my birthday that year but my husband just sat in the garage smoking black tar heroin. 

We drifted apart. I still had the fabric and some completed blocks. 

I managed to leave that awful place. When I found a new place to stay, it was difficult to find a place to sew. Most of my belongings were in storage. It took a few trips but I managed to get all the materials I needed and started making blocks. 

His mom would occasionally text me, to both check on me and see if I was able to work on the quilt. I started to hate the quilt. I hated that she asked. I hated my guilt for all the things that I thought were in my control. I hated that heroin and fent came to mind when I held my grandmother’s quilting notions that were left to me. 

I spiraled further. 

I went to counseling. I worked on codependency. I worked on guilt. 

Then one day I became inspired. I tried to make one block. I succeeded. It was scary. It had been nearly two years since I had started. Over a year since I left my husband. 

I met someone new. I asked if I could use his large kitchen counter to sew. He agreed. Enthusiastically even. 

I started making more blocks. I felt even more inspired. I began imagining what the quilt would mean to my friend. 

Then, his father died. I went to the funeral. I saw my ex husband. He forced a hug I couldn’t refuse in front of everyone. I felt disgusted. But I didn’t feel afraid. 

I went back home and I quilted some more. The fact that he forced a hug lit a fire. I wouldn’t let him take this from me anymore. It was mine. 

It was me. I wouldn’t let him take me. 

I worked. I cried sometimes… okay a lot. I sewed. I asked my now serious boyfriend if I could take over his guest room. He obliged. He helped. I had a new space. I quilted even more. 

Suddenly, the blocks were done. Then the top. I realized it had been so long that I couldn’t find the border fabric anywhere. So I made my own border. It was… fun! I created something from scratch and it was all mine. 

My friend’s mom texted me and for once I felt good about her outreach. I asked if she wanted to see progress on his quilt and she was ecstatic. 

I finished the quilt top. She said it was time for a roadtrip. It was her, a mutual friend, and me. We drive for two hours. We laughed. We cried. The mutual friend had lost her daughter only months ago. The roadtrip was just something to fill the time for her, but I was so grateful to be a part of that time. The quilt now had new meaning. 

December of 2025 came. At a birthday dinner I surprised my old friend with a new quilt. Two years of exploring my inner self was finished. Two years of fear and anxiety were done. It was time to move on. 

Now I quilt for me. 

I hope this inspires you. I hope you never let someone take away who you are. However, if they do, you can take yourself back. ",24,1770142775.0,quilting,2,1.0,False

This thing is loud. Ita definitely a ""main character energy"" piece for around the house. The terry cloth feels heavy, and the baroque print on the cuffs/belt is classic Versace.If you want to feel like a high-end villain while making coffee, this is it. It鈥檚 a bit over-the-top, but thats the point.

Score: 7.5/10

2. Acne Studios Stockholm 1996 Windbreaker

I love the boxy, retro silhouette on this. The contrast between the plaid body and the grey sleeves gives it a nice ""dad style"" aesthetic that's very on-trend. The material feels durable but light.Solid layering piece. Very versatile for spring/autumn weather.

Score: 8/10

3. Stussy ""Big Logo"" Knit Sweater 

Hands down my favorite piece in the entire haul. The knit is surprisingly thick, and the way the logo wraps around the side and sleeve is just elite design. It's that perfect oversized fit that doesn't look sloppy.Absolute 10/10. If youre only getting one thing, make it this. Its cozy, iconic, and goes with literally everything.

Score: 10/10

4. Chrome Hearts Long Sleeve (White/Floral) 

Classic CH. The sleeve prints are crisp, and the cotton is soft. However, compared to the other items, it feels a bit ""safe."" Its a staple, but it doesn't have the same ""wow"" factor as the knits.Good for a clean, monochromatic fit. A bit basic, but high quality.

Score: 7/10

5. Hellstar ""Path to Paradise"" Flare Sweats 

These are interesting. The flared bottom is a bold choice, and the vintage-wash/distressing looks authentic. The graphics are heavy-duty screen prints.They are definitely a specific vibe. If you aren't into the flared look, these might feel a bit awkward, but the ""star"" details are cool.

Score: 7/10

6. Hellstar Logo T-Shirt 

A much easier wear than the flares. The faded black/grey wash is perfect for that worn-in vintage look. It has a nice heavyweight feel to it ot a flimsy tee.Great everyday shirt. Low effort, high style.

Score: 8.5/10

7. Balenciaga ""01"" Jersey Long Sleeve 

The sporty/moto-cross aesthetic is hit or miss, but I think the grey tone here works well. The branding is bold but the colors are muted enough to not look like a literal race suit.Very high-fashion ""street"" vibe. A bit boxy in the shoulders, so keep that in mind.

Score: 7.5/10

8. Carhartt WIP Essential Crewneck 

Nothing much to say here Carhartt. The cream color is gorgeous in person. Its the kind of piece you'll still be wearing in five years.The definition of a reliable basic. Quality is top-notch.

Score: 9/10 (for what it is)

9. Cole Buxton ""CB"" Knit 

A really nice, heavy wool-blend feel. The mock neck is tight (in a good way) and the branding is simple. Its a very ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic.Sophisticated and cozy. It's a bit itchy if you have sensitive skin, but the silhouette is perfect.

Score: 8/10

10. Distressed Wide-Leg Painted Jeans 

These have a very ""Balenciaga-adjacent"" aesthetic with the heavy fading and paint splatter. The wide-leg cut is perfect for the current silhouette trends, especially if you're trying to hide the bulk of some chunky boots.Great if you're into the grunge/streetwear look. The paint detail feels intentional rather than messy.

Score: 7.5/10

11. AMI Paris ""Ami de Coeur"" Grey Hoodie

This is a classic ""if you know, you know"" piece. The oversized heart patch on the grey heathered fabric is clean and recognizable without being obnoxious. The hood looks structured, which is a big plus for me.A premium essential. Its the kind of hoodie that makes a simple outfit look expensive.

Score: 8.5/10

12. Chrome Hearts ""Sun-Faded"" Crewneck 

The fading on this is the highlight gives it a genuine vintage, sun-bleached look thathard to replicate. The circular logo patch  on the chest is a nice alternative to the usual sleeve prints.If you want Chrome Hearts but don't want to look like a walking billboard, this is a more tasteful choice.

Score: 8/10

13. Goyard ""Steamer"" Style Backpack/Bag 

The Goyardine pattern is iconic, and this specific structured shape is a bit more unique than the standard totes. It looks like a solid travel or work companion for a ""quiet luxury"" (or not so quiet) vibe.Very high-end. It鈥檚 a statement accessory that elevates everything else you're wearing.

Score: 7/10 (Mostly because it's hard to style casually).

14. Maison Mihara Yasuhiro (MMY) ""Hank"" Lows 

The ""melted"" sole is a love-it-or-hate-it design, but its a  modern streetwear staple. The chunky laces and warped midsole give a standard canvas shoe a complete avant-garde makeover.Super trendy right now. They look great with the wide-leg jeans from earlier in the haul.

Score: 9/10

15. Timberland 6-Inch Premium Boots (Triple Black) 

You can't go wrong with ""Constructs,"" and the all-black colorway makes them much more versatile for darker, monochromatic fits. They look rugged, waterproof, and ready for winter.An absolute tank of a boot. Every wardrobe needs a pair of Timbs.

And what does slow healing mean for aging/longevity?,"On Dec 28, my husband (m46) sliced the tip of his finger off while washing the fish tank canopy. After 3hrs of continuous bleeding he went to the ER where they told him there was nothing to stitch cause the fingertip went down the drain so they cleaned and bandaged it, and said to keep it clean for however long it took to heal. The Dr said he’d likely have a permanent deformity. He said he could see a tiny bit of bone, that’s how much finger was gone.

A couple nights later on nye I fell pretty hard and bruised my elbow. I was wearing a sweater and coat, so the skin didn’t break but it was a big bruise.

Over the next few weeks, my husband’s fingertip turned black and honestly looked disgusting. No smell, no infection though so we kept it clean and bandaged like we were told.

About a month later, the bandage accidentally ripped off when it caught on something, and underneath was a brand new fingertip. No deformity. A completely normal fingertip. Just a little pink and sensitive.

I was shocked!

Meanwhile, my elbow was still bruised.

How TF did this man regrow an entire fingertip while my body can’t even heal a bruise?

I consider myself generally healthy. I eat well, exercise, avoid processed food, and take vitamin D, omega oils, and magnesium. But I’ve always been a slow healer. Cuts and bruises take forever and the surgeries I've had took me double the expected time.

My husband, on the other hand, smokes heavily, lives on coffee and beer, eats a stereotypical garbage American diet (he genuinely thinks “dieting” means replacing his usual big mac combo lunch with a whole large bag of chips). He's sedentary, has a high stress job and has been steadily gaining weight for the past 5 years.

And yet he heals so fast from everything. Cuts and bruises heal quickly, any scars fade to nothing in a couple years. When we both get sick, he’s back to normal in a few days while I’m coughing up phlegm for weeks.

What’s the deal with that? It’s driving me nuts! 

I'm worried that despite all my efforts to be healthy and age well, there's something wrong with me and this mf'er is going to live forever on beer and pizza. 

I guess it's genetic cause my mom is a slow healer but is that all there is to it?

Is healing speed just genetic? Or are there other factors? 

Is there anything you can actually do to improve healing capacity? What does slow healing really mean for aging? Can increasing healing ability contribute to longevity?

**Tldr**: Husband lives extremely unhealthy lifestyle and heals super fast, I have very healthy lifestyle and heal very slow. Why? And what does this mean for longevity/aging?

The pain attacks started a year ago, it used to start at night one hour after the meal with whole night in pain and back to normal in the morning. After multiple visits to different doctors and normal test reports for a year, I was luckily sent for an Ultrasound which helped with diagnosis of multiple stones in gallbladder with as big as 1 cm size of the gallstones. 

Since the diagnosis (Doc didn't tell me this) I am on low fat diet, I am constantly hungry, still avoid eating large meals, chips & biscuits, occasionally drink a cup of coffee a day and eat out 1-2 times a month, exercising 3 times a week (Cardio and weightlift), switched to almond milk, reduced spices and butter in meals. I still get pain attacks 2-3 times a month. 

The diagnosis helped me understand the cause of issue but increased my anxiety and fear of pain attacks. I always carry Tylenol and Ibuprofen EVERYWHERE. 

1 ER visit so far after diagnosis - Paramedics gave me 2 Tylenol & 2 Ibuprofen before I could see the ER doc, strong dosage helped with pain relief in 1 hour and I was dismissed without any other help and normal test results. 

Now, I call and inform my doctor's office every time I get the pain attacks, Doc recently mentioned the constant pain could also mean - rising inflammation in body and/or infection around the Gallbladder. (FML)

Family Doc's advise for me: wait for surgeon office to call, take Tylenol if pain persists, visit ER if you get pain with fever and chills (Just wait until you get hooked on pain killers and ruin your body internally and eventually die)

I’ve documented the worst offenders below. Lucid, if you’re reading this, stop focusing on the next model and fix the one we already paid for.

1. The ""Key Fob"" & Window Fails

• The 100-Click Struggle: I have to click the button a hundred times for it to detect the key. Then, the car demands a PIN even if I have the key card! What’s the point of Facial Recognition if it doesn't actually let me just drive?

• Missing Features: Why does this car NOT have an ""auto-close all windows"" feature when locking or exiting? It’s basic. We need a shortcut where we can click the key 4 times and hold to roll everything up or down.

2. Software & Quality of Life

• Microphone/CarPlay Limbo: CarPlay is glitchy, never full screen, and the mic is trash. People can’t hear me on calls—I have to disconnect my phone just to speak.

• Navigation: The built-in maps don’t even have a ""No Tolls"" toggle. How is that possible in 2026?

• Seatbelt Chime: If someone in the back unbuckles (or I just have a heavy bag), it screams. There is no option to dismiss the alert.

• The App: It takes forever to connect and gives you almost zero control over the vehicle compared to the competition.

3. Hardware & Luxury Oversight

• Suspension & Mirrors: No air suspension on a $100k flagship? It doesn't ""float"" like a Mercedes or a Porsche. Also, my mirrors froze solid after a wash—turns out they aren’t even heated! I couldn’t see anything to pull out of my driveway.

• The Frunk Struggle: Opening it is a gamble; closing it is a chore. It gets stuck constantly both ways.

• Turn Signal Cameras: The quality is garbage for this price. Why are they tiny windows? Put them in full view at the end of each screen! Also, let us change that annoying turn signal sound.

4. Ergonomics

• The Cup Holders: You can't fit a 1L bottle—they are too small and tight. No cooling or heating options for drinks either?

• The Wireless Charger: My iPhone 15 Pro Max doesn't even fit properly. The wireless charger is uncomfortable to use, gets hot, and barely works. It’s basically a useless piece of plastic.

• Sound System: For a ""premium"" car, the sound system is absolutely garbage.

Samantha’s POV 

“Slave, you’ve been summoned to Alpha Kade’s private chamber.” My stomach dropped when I received the order from the Gamma of the pack. 

I had just finished my work for the day. My work as a slave had been grueling as usual, but being summoned to Alpha Kade’s chamber for sex—that was far more terrifying than any other dirty chores I was asked to do. 

But I had no choice. 

This was all part of my punishment. My punishment for a crime that my twin sister Serena, and not me, had committed. 

Kade and I were best friends when we were kids. We were both strong Alpha kids living in neighboring packs, so we had a lot to talk about and always trained and adventured together. 

Kade also has a sister, Debbie, who was two years younger than us. Serena and Debbie were both the quieter type. They weren’t strong like Kade and I, but that didn’t matter. Not back then, at least. 

Everything was perfect until five years ago, when Serena somehow managed to bring Debbie with her when she adventured past the border patrol and into the forbidden forest out of curiosity. I wasn’t sure if that was Serena’s first time doing that, but unfortunately, their presence was discovered by rogues. 

They tried to run away, but they were weak and young. Just when they were about to be caught, they ran into Kade’s parents on their way home. Kade’s parents mindlinked the pack for help while they tried to protect Serena and Debbie. 

However, by the time help finally arrived, Kade’s parents had been killed by the rogues. To make matters worse, Kade’s sister was dragged away and raped by the rogues. Serena was the only one who escaped while Kade’s parents fought desperately. Conveniently, she was gone by the time Kade arrived. 

Kade angrily demanded that someone had to pay for the crime—the punishment was indentured servitude of five years—and so my parents decided to hand me over instead of Serena. 

When I resisted, they begged me—told me that Serena was weaker, that I could handle it and she couldn’t. It didn’t matter that I didn’t do anything wrong. It didn’t matter that I didn’t want to take the blame. 

They forced it on me anyway. And no matter how many times I tried to explain myself, it was useless. 

Everyone trusted my parents. No one thought they would lie about something like that, and Serena, the perfect and quiet girl who would never get in trouble, went unsuspected. Even Debbie didn’t believe me; she was so mentally unhinged after that night that all she did was point at me with a shaking finger and say that she saw my face right before it all happened. 

No one thought that it was only because I looked like Serena and not because I actually caused the accident. 

So, for five years, I became Alpha Kade’s slave. 

For five years, I did everything Kade wanted me to do. 

By now, I had become numb to the physical pain and exhaustion I endured in the pack house of Crescent Hollow. The Gammas and Omegas beat me nonstop and forced me to do all of the worst jobs around the house as punishment for my crime. 

But whenever I was summoned to Kade’s house… I was terrified. 

Kade usually summoned me to his room for humiliation when he was triggered by Debbie’s pain. It was revenge for what his sister had been through. 

Though not as violent as what Debbie had been through, Kade made sure what happened in his chamber humiliated me deeply. 

The worst thing about all of it was that I found out Kade was my fated mate after I turned eighteen. My wolf tried her best to hide our scent from him. But still, every cruel intimacy between Kade and I made my suffering a thousand times worse. 

How could I be both drawn to him and frightened of him at the same time? 

“But I haven’t even had dinner,” I protested to the Gamma weakly, standing. My joints ached from kneeling on the floor; I had spent hours scrubbing the hardwood until it practically sparkled in the torchlight. 

“You know the rules,” the Gamma growled. “Come with me. Now.” 

I had no choice but to obey, of course. Even though my hands shook and my legs wanted to carry me in the opposite direction, I obeyed and followed the Gamma down the hall. 

When I entered the bathroom, I found two stern-faced Omega maids waiting for me beside the tub. I was rarely allowed baths anymore, but I knew that it wasn’t a luxury. It was part of my punishment. 

The maids stripped me violently, revealing my naked body, which had grown frail and slender from lack of food over the years. Once, I had been curvy and beautiful, but now my body could only focus on mere survival. I could count my ribs, and the long days of constant work with only a single slice of bread and a tiny bowl of porridge made it difficult to even think straight. 

As the maids roughly washed me in the ice cold bathwater, scrubbing violently against my skin and angrily combing through my once-beautiful golden locks and hitting me in the head with the hairbrush whenever I moved, I tried my best to shut my eyes and breathe deep, preparing myself mentally for what was to come. 

Once I was clean and decent enough for the Alpha, I followed the Gamma down the hall to Kade’s private chambers. My heart thudded violently in my chest while he knocked, and a voice called from within, “Enter.” 

It was Kade’s voice, deep and rumbling and terrifying. I shuddered just at the sound, but that little piece of my heart also lurched with anticipation. 

The Gamma opened the door and shoved me inside, sending me to my knees. Pain barked through the joints as I fell to the hardwood. I didn’t need to look up to know that Kade was lounging in his usual chair by the fireside, watching me with those cold gray eyes of his. 

“Come here,” he ordered. 

I slowly looked up and felt my breath caught. He was shirtless, tanned muscles on full display, raven hair loose around his shoulders. In this light, with the scars on his chest highlighted by the firelight, he looked like a rogue warlord. 

“Didn’t you hear me?” Kade leaned forward. “Come. Here.” 

My pulse spiked, but I obeyed and stood, walking over to him. When I stopped in front of him, he stared at me for a long moment, gray eyes wandering my form. For a moment, just a moment, I could smell his cologne. It was rich and warm like coffee and spices. 

Wordlessly, Kade stood, towering over me, and lifted me into his arms. I didn’t resist—couldn’t resist, because even though I knew I was about to face the most brutal humiliation of all, that foolish little shred of my heart still wanted this. Wanted him. 

He laid me down on the bed face-down and lifted my skirt just enough. He never fully undressed me, never looked at me in the face when he slipped himself into me. 

Maybe that was for the best. Because I knew if I looked him in the eye, I might lose control and reveal the secret I’d been keeping for five years. 

“Debbie had two episodes today, screaming and thrashing everything in her room,” Kade whispered as he slipped his hard member into me with painstaking slowness. His hand cracked across my ass, sending pain stinging through my skin. 

Kade curled his fingers into my hair as he seated himself fully in me.”I want you to remember that you are a gross murderer. A sinner.” His other hand spanked me again. “Say it.” 

“No.” 

It was humiliating and perfect and terrible all at once—that feeling of completeness as he began to move in me. But emotionally… Emotionally, the man I was bound to hated me to my very core. 

“Say it,” he commanded again. One thrust. Then another. Another spank that made my eyes prick with tears. 

“No—” 

“Say. It.” 

The thrusts became slower, more halting. My body ached for the only sensation of pleasure I’d received in months. And though tears began to prick my eyes at the humiliation, I grit my teeth and said the words he wanted me to say. 

“I am a murderer.” 

“Again.” 

“No—” 

“Again!” 

“I… I am a gross murderer!” 

“And remember that your sin will never be forgiven. And you will never be loved. Not by me, not by anyone. ” 

What followed was the most humiliating joining we’d had in months. 

Kade never hit me, no, but he didn’t need to—the mental torment was far worse than the physical abuse of the Omegas and Gammas. 

To have a man—the man you truly want on a deep and primal level, even if he hates you—inside of you in the most intimate way possible, bringing you to your edge only to pull back and tell you how worthless you are to him… 

The only reprieve I got from it was when my world finally went black mere moments before my climax. The last thing I saw before everything turned dark was Kade’s face moving above me, twisted with equal parts hatred and ecstasy. 

When I woke, I found myself lying on the small cot in the tiny storage closet that was my bedroom. My entire body ached, and my head felt like it was on fire. I groaned, pressing my hand to my temple. 

“Ava… What happened?” I whispered aloud into the darkness. I felt strange and foggy, and I faintly recalled passing out during my punishment. “Did I faint from lack of food again?” 

Ava was quiet for a long moment. Too long. Finally, she whispered, “There’s something I have to tell you…” 

“What is it?” I struggled to sit up, but it was useless. My body felt too weak and fragile, and I felt like I might vomit if I moved too much.

Samantha’s POV 

“Slave, you’ve been summoned to Alpha Kade’s private chamber.” My stomach dropped when I received the order from the Gamma of the pack. 

I had just finished my work for the day. My work as a slave had been grueling as usual, but being summoned to Alpha Kade’s chamber for sex—that was far more terrifying than any other dirty chores I was asked to do. 

But I had no choice. 

This was all part of my punishment. My punishment for a crime that my twin sister Serena, and not me, had committed. 

Kade and I were best friends when we were kids. We were both strong Alpha kids living in neighboring packs, so we had a lot to talk about and always trained and adventured together. 

Kade also has a sister, Debbie, who was two years younger than us. Serena and Debbie were both the quieter type. They weren’t strong like Kade and I, but that didn’t matter. Not back then, at least. 

Everything was perfect until five years ago, when Serena somehow managed to bring Debbie with her when she adventured past the border patrol and into the forbidden forest out of curiosity. I wasn’t sure if that was Serena’s first time doing that, but unfortunately, their presence was discovered by rogues. 

They tried to run away, but they were weak and young. Just when they were about to be caught, they ran into Kade’s parents on their way home. Kade’s parents mindlinked the pack for help while they tried to protect Serena and Debbie. 

However, by the time help finally arrived, Kade’s parents had been killed by the rogues. To make matters worse, Kade’s sister was dragged away and raped by the rogues. Serena was the only one who escaped while Kade’s parents fought desperately. Conveniently, she was gone by the time Kade arrived. 

Kade angrily demanded that someone had to pay for the crime—the punishment was indentured servitude of five years—and so my parents decided to hand me over instead of Serena. 

When I resisted, they begged me—told me that Serena was weaker, that I could handle it and she couldn’t. It didn’t matter that I didn’t do anything wrong. It didn’t matter that I didn’t want to take the blame. 

They forced it on me anyway. And no matter how many times I tried to explain myself, it was useless. 

Everyone trusted my parents. No one thought they would lie about something like that, and Serena, the perfect and quiet girl who would never get in trouble, went unsuspected. Even Debbie didn’t believe me; she was so mentally unhinged after that night that all she did was point at me with a shaking finger and say that she saw my face right before it all happened. 

No one thought that it was only because I looked like Serena and not because I actually caused the accident. 

So, for five years, I became Alpha Kade’s slave. 

For five years, I did everything Kade wanted me to do. 

By now, I had become numb to the physical pain and exhaustion I endured in the pack house of Crescent Hollow. The Gammas and Omegas beat me nonstop and forced me to do all of the worst jobs around the house as punishment for my crime. 

But whenever I was summoned to Kade’s house… I was terrified. 

Kade usually summoned me to his room for humiliation when he was triggered by Debbie’s pain. It was revenge for what his sister had been through. 

Though not as violent as what Debbie had been through, Kade made sure what happened in his chamber humiliated me deeply. 

The worst thing about all of it was that I found out Kade was my fated mate after I turned eighteen. My wolf tried her best to hide our scent from him. But still, every cruel intimacy between Kade and I made my suffering a thousand times worse. 

How could I be both drawn to him and frightened of him at the same time? 

“But I haven’t even had dinner,” I protested to the Gamma weakly, standing. My joints ached from kneeling on the floor; I had spent hours scrubbing the hardwood until it practically sparkled in the torchlight. 

“You know the rules,” the Gamma growled. “Come with me. Now.” 

I had no choice but to obey, of course. Even though my hands shook and my legs wanted to carry me in the opposite direction, I obeyed and followed the Gamma down the hall. 

When I entered the bathroom, I found two stern-faced Omega maids waiting for me beside the tub. I was rarely allowed baths anymore, but I knew that it wasn’t a luxury. It was part of my punishment. 

The maids stripped me violently, revealing my naked body, which had grown frail and slender from lack of food over the years. Once, I had been curvy and beautiful, but now my body could only focus on mere survival. I could count my ribs, and the long days of constant work with only a single slice of bread and a tiny bowl of porridge made it difficult to even think straight. 

As the maids roughly washed me in the ice cold bathwater, scrubbing violently against my skin and angrily combing through my once-beautiful golden locks and hitting me in the head with the hairbrush whenever I moved, I tried my best to shut my eyes and breathe deep, preparing myself mentally for what was to come. 

Once I was clean and decent enough for the Alpha, I followed the Gamma down the hall to Kade’s private chambers. My heart thudded violently in my chest while he knocked, and a voice called from within, “Enter.” 

It was Kade’s voice, deep and rumbling and terrifying. I shuddered just at the sound, but that little piece of my heart also lurched with anticipation. 

The Gamma opened the door and shoved me inside, sending me to my knees. Pain barked through the joints as I fell to the hardwood. I didn’t need to look up to know that Kade was lounging in his usual chair by the fireside, watching me with those cold gray eyes of his.

​With the 2026 season in full swing, I wanted to share a guide to my hometown, Jaipur. Most tourists get stuck in the ""Amber-Hawa Mahal"" loop, but there is so much more to see—and a few things you should definitely avoid.

​✨ 10 Hidden Gems (Avoid the Crowds)

​The Great Wall of Amer: Opposite Amer Fort. Best at sunrise for a view that rivals the Great Wall of China.

​Sagar Lake: Tucked behind Amer Fort. A serene spot to hear the birds instead of horns.

​Panna Meena ka Kund: A stunning 16th-century stepwell. Go before 9 AM for the best photos.

​Gaitore Ki Chhatriyan: Royal cenotaphs with intricate marble carvings; usually very peaceful.

​Galta Ji (Monkey Temple): Hike up at sunset for a panoramic view of the ""Pink City"" glow.

​Sanganer Block Printing: 20 mins away. See how Rajasthani fabrics are hand-stamped in local workshops.

​Patrika Gate: The most colorful gateway in India, representing different eras of our history.

​Jawahar Kala Kendra (JKK): An architectural marvel based on nine planets. Great coffee at the Indian Coffee House here.

​Maharaniyon ki Chhatriyan: A floral-carved memorial for the queens of Jaipur.

​Night View from Nahargarh: Sit at the edge of the hill at night; the city looks like a carpet of gold.

​🎨 Surviving Holi 2026

​Jaipur is legendary during the festival, but it can be overwhelming:

​Stay Safe: Avoid wandering narrow Old City lanes alone after 10 AM on the main day.

​Celebrations: The official events by Rajasthan Tourism are very organized and great for solo travelers or foreigners.

​Spiritual Experience: Visit Govind Dev Ji Temple for the beautiful flower-based (Phoolon ki Holi) celebration.

​Color Tip: Don't let ""guides"" talk you into buying expensive colors. Just pick some up from a local neighborhood grocery store.

​🚫 Scams to Watch Out For

​The Gemstone Trap: If someone asks for help ""exporting"" gems to avoid tax—it’s a scam.

 * The ""Monument is Closed"" Trick: Rickshaw drivers might say a fort is closed for a private event to take you shopping. Always check the gate yourself.

​Transport: Stick to Uber or Ola to avoid the ""tourist price"" arguments.


​🏠 A Local Connection/Personal Note

​I run a small, family-owned Homestay in a quiet residential area. I started it to provide a safe space where travelers aren't treated like ""targets.""
​If you’re looking for a premium yet budget-friendly entire home with all amenities, or just need a host to help you plan an honest itinerary, feel free to shoot me a DM! I’m happy to share my location or help you out even if you stay elsewhere.

I've been doing seasonal work for three years, but this year they called me well before the season started: “A position just opened up, and we immediately thought of you!” Well, it's not my dream job, but it's quiet, with a small, close-knit team and a very safe and comfortable working environment. Okay, I'll sign. “However, we're only offering you a five-month contract for now, but don't worry, it will serve as a trial period.” That's weird, I know the job well and they already know I work hard, but let's go with it. 
And for five months, I give it my all. I'm super motivated! I received praise for my work ethic and my results, I took a lot of initiative, and I was informally trained by a colleague to improve my skills. However, strangely enough, my manager was rather evasive when I asked him when I would officially take the position. Then he's cold. And finally, he tells me to get lost: “Actually, you're not getting the job. We've chosen a guy who's been working here for two weeks.”
Reasons: he's smarter, more talkative, and has a better MBTI profile (??).
Okay, let's say he has a better MBTI profile, but what exactly does he mean by smarter? ""Well, he talks a lot and loudly, he's very “assertive,” and he's traveled to lots of countries ;))"" Great. 
“And by the way, if you could stay an extra week to train him, that would be great!”

The prospect of finding myself unemployed doesn't really appeal to me, and I'm not opposed to an extra week's pay to help me get over it. And once again, I'm a huge sucker. Yes, that's right, I'm going to train him. 

The five months and a week are up, and I even get a “too bad we can't keep you, sucker :'(” from my two managers. How sweet. 

Two weeks later, last Monday, I get a phone call at 7 a.m.!
"" Hey sucker, so it turns out that the awesome MBTI guy we hired even though he doesn't know how to do the job, doesn't know how to do the job, can you come back on Thursday?"" Sure, I can. Phone call at 5 p.m.: “Actually, we're in deep shit. Can you come in tomorrow at noon?” Sure, I can. 10 fucking p.m.  night: “Um, is 8 a.m. tomorrow okay for you?” 
I was there. Sucker. 

After days that I would unashamedly describe as being about as pleasant as having buckets of frozen vomit thrown in my face (although maybe buckets of vomit would be more pleasant, I haven't tried), days of enduring horrific workdays under the contemptuous gaze of awesome MBTI guy, who is surely one of the most unpleasant and anti-intellectual guys I've ever worked with: here we are at The Apocalypse! I handled the biggest disaster imaginable in this fucking job, all by myself. No colleagues, no management, nada. Just me with a mess beyond description to deal with and my tears of frustration.

Hey. I'm a sucker, not a madman. When my manager welcomed me into his office like I was the Messiah and I presented my against all odds victorious record, I was expecting a little something. Maybe a contract, just maybe. Then he looked at me, smiled kindly as he put his big paw on my shoulder like the fucking Pope blessing a leper, and said, “LOL, no. You're done next Wednesday.”

Right now, I'm sitting on my sucker ass in my chair, refusing to do a single thing. I'm watching them work while I write this post. I'm not sure if I want to come back tomorrow for my last day and watch them struggle all day long or not.

1quz68o,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1quz68o/need_help_planning_and_investing/,Need help planning and investing,"Hello,

Let me start by saying that I will be completely CC debt free at the end of February. I have struggled for 10 years to come out ahead and position my future self for retirement and growing my net worth. I’ve paid down 20k with the remaining 2k to be wiped out by the end of this month. 😭

I’m 34M and looking to retire with enough money.

Onto the planning and investing arc of my life!

In addition to coming out of debt, I have also worked hard to start a new career and in my field I started a new role in December making 85k annually. I am contributing to:

HSA @ $46.15/mo, or $1200/yr.

Employer contribution is $1000 annual split per quarter.

Note: While I will try to not use this money; I do have some medical needs coming up. This account may be used for investing at a later date.

401k @ 8% $261.54/check

Employer match info: 100% of pretax matched up to 6%

Note: I may consider dropping this to 6% to keep match and route the additional money to my Roth IRA.

Roth IRA: Balance $0

I am likely only able to contribute $250/mo, and possibly my tax returns (minimum 2000) to my Roth at this time.

My bi-weekly take home after taxes and deductions is $2359.14, rounded down to $4718/mo.

I have a wife and daughter. My wife is disabled and takes home SSDI at $725/mo.

Total take home is $5443 monthly.

Checking: $3000

401k: 25k in a target date fund

Old HSA: $1500

New HSA: $360

Currently living with family in a large basement. No rent required at this time. Estimate time before rent/mortgage is 2-3 years.

An area of improvement is expenses on food. We eat out… a lot. This is in part due to sharing a house and the family we live with are very anal about the kitchen in particular. We have avoided using it much, unfortunately. Will need to discuss with family and come to some sort of agreement.

Food budget is probably around $1200/mo.

Required monthly expenses:

Auto insurance $110

Gas $80

Medigap $90

Cigna secondary $250 (wife has autoimmune diseases and needs monthly infusions, this covers our portion which would math out to be double the cost to have this plan yearly)

Subscriptions: $50

\- no phone bill, courtesy of my parents family plan.

Non-CC debt:

Auto Loan balance of $60,500 at 1.99% for 60/mo which eats up $1060/mo. Not much I can do about this for now.

Stupidly, my wife and I had two cars financed for about the same balance, each loan at 5.2% and 5.9%. We were underwater on one for about $6000 which started having problems mechanically. We essentially consolidated down to one car saving on an insurance policy, rolled negative equity into a new loan at 1.99%. I am saving money monthly doing this, but yes, the balance is high. I plan to contribute an additional $300/mo principal payment to break even on loan closure (rough math; originally planned for 500). This additional payment is my savings from the loans and insurance plus a little more.

Goals:

Begin by planning out meals, food prep and a budget. Ideally I stay around $600-800 per month for a family of three.

Convince my wife to quit coffee runs, in November last year I spent $290 at a local coffee shop.

Maintain investments and additional principal payment to pay down my auto loan to free up $1060(+300) in 2-3 years to position myself for rent/mortgage.

A second car will be needed when we have moved out. I will be smart about this and use a separate fund to purchase a vehicle for no more than $10,000 with at least $5000 down.

Begin investing in Roth IRA. Advice welcome! I’ve read VOO 80% VXUS 20%. As mentioned, may only be able to contribute $250 until a better food budget is worked out.

Save 6 months of living expenses in a HYSA and leave it.

Within 3 years, continue advancing my career, but assume 85k is consistent with my plans.

Conclusion:

I have to begin on a food budget and convince my wife to quit coffee, or make it at home. I know this. Otherwise, I’m so overwhelmed with needing to save and plan that I feel stun locked.

Some quick math shows that I’m able to afford all of this, even my terrible food spending. I haven’t seen that just yet because I’m still paying off debt. Maybe March will be my turning point.

My wife and I are 30, have been together 12 years, married for nearly 9. We’ve had a good relationship. Lots of ups and downs but nothing we couldn’t overcome. A year and a half ago she felt her feelings had boiled over and she needed to leave. I was clueless and blindsided. She kept any feelings she had from me. Things never seemed distant or cold between us. Going on vacations, spending quality time together, both with friends and family, great sex life. Ultimately after two weeks she came home and we reconciled. We talked about going to couples counseling and individual therapy but didn’t. We let life get back in the way. I had reflected on things I needEd to change and I did so in some ways. Others went by the wayside. She cited I wasn’t taking care of myself. That she felt like a roommate. That the spark was lost. 

So I worked on myself. Got back in the gym, finished and absolutely crushed nursing school, etc. Along the way we planned a big move to Chicago from GA. We sold our home because it was a huge point of stress for us we didn’t want anymore. Got an apartment, started making moves to get to Chicago this summer. 

Fast forward to now, we had planned a trip to Chicago in a couple months to go sign leases. Our apartment lease is up soon. Things were awesome for us, at least what I assumed. I have been the happiest I’ve been in a long time. On no antidepressants anymore and we were both just winning at life. She just accepted a job in Chicago right after I got my nursing license last week. 

The following day, she woke up and told me she was sad. I asked why and I could tell it was coming. She told me she wanted a divorce. It went from me bringing her coffee in bed to wake her as usual for an exciting day off together to an hour later she was packed and on the way to her parent’s. 

We’ve talked a few times in the last 5-6 days she’s been gone. Brought the dog back and forth to spend time with. She cited a lot of the same issues as before. Roommate. No spark. I admit I did some begging. I have tried some love bombing (it seemed to work last time). But this time I feel like it’s a done deal. I took the initiative to schedule us a couples counseling appt for next week since that’s what we agreed on the first time this happened we just didnt do it. She’s been hesitant to say whether she wants to go for sure or not. She says she’s given me all she can. I just have a hard time seeing it. I feel like she continued to keep feelings of small issues bottled up and allowed them to breed resentment. I’ve done some reflecting and there are numerous things I could’ve done differently. Been less negative overall. Gone to bed with her every night instead of staying up and gaming with friends. (She goes to sleep early on work nights). I could have done more to spend time with her on my time off from nursing school. But I feel like it all got in the way. I feel betrayed, confused, like it’s all unfair to me and to us. 

We knew school would be hard on us. 3 years ago she went through the same schooling and it was hard but we got through it. We had the same talk before I started.

I’m from Vietnam.

I specialize in the production and processing of natural dry powders, such as turmeric powder, moringa powder, neem powder, rose powder, coconut powder, coffee powder, and more. These products are widely used for spa treatments, facial masks, skincare, and as raw materials for cosmetic manufacturing.

I have been working in this field for over 6 years. I started with a small retail business, and over time, I have built my own factory with machinery for production and packaging. Currently, my products are selling very well in the Vietnamese market, including on e-commerce platforms, and my business is stable and growing domestically.

However, I am still exploring ways to export and expand into international markets. I am looking to learn how to approach foreign markets and create opportunities to work with small and large businesses overseas.

I can manufacture, process, and package natural powder products.

I have strong marketing capabilities, including product photography, video production, and marketing campaign planning.

I am very interested in connecting with potential partners who are passionate about business, agricultural products, or natural skincare and cosmetic ingredients, so we can exchange ideas and explore opportunities to work together in the future.

The cruises that we have been on, including the one last month, there were things that disturbed me about hygiene, and I wondered, do people really not care about others?

The things that happen are mainly in the dining/buffet areas, when I am sitting trying to enjoy a nice meal, and someone starts blowing their nose, really hard and loud!

The issues I have are:

#1 - Just the sound of it when I am eating makes me loose my appetite.

#2 - Some people make a spectacle of the act of nose blowing, as if no one else is around and they feel they can do whatever they want. Blow, pick, blow, rub ......

#3 - Some have the audacity to use the cruiselines linen napkins, then put it beside their plate on the placemat (which is not sanitized for the next guest that sits in that spot), or puts it on their plate.... either way, the dining room staff pick these up after with their bare hands (unknowing what was deposited in it) and then serves other guests. Yuck!!!

#4 - Some use their own cloth hankies. They are disgusting (and should not be allowed in our universe!), they are used over and over and over and they are the worst germ/virus carrying item ever! 

AND, they NEVER get up to go wash or sanitize their hands. AND, the majority of times, they get up to go get seconds or desserts, or coffee, or........

What is wrong with some people?   Did Covid not teach some people anything? And the other multitudes of viruses that continue to circulate because of bad hygiene.  Then people wonder why a ship full of people get sick!!!

Please, be conscious of what you do on a ship and other public areas....

Some friendly advice:

1 - Go to the washroom and blow your nose and the other stuff you do, in private so no one can see or hear you. Thats what washrooms are for!!

2 - Wash your hands, thoroughly!!

3 - Never use a restaurants linen napkins to blow your nose!!!!

4 - Stop using filthy hankies!  Those were used back in the day before the great invention of kleenex/facial tissue. Wives, if your husband uses them, throw them away and buy him some kleenex!!

And, PLEASE, in the buffet areas please keep your hands away from your face! Stop, scratching, rubbing, or picking your face or head. And GO WASH YOUR HANDS!!

If everyone had better hygiene habits there would be less outbreaks on a ship and a better vacation for everyone!!

1quyuhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1quyuhv/coffee_cart_business/,Coffee Cart Business,"So I was looking into requirements for a coffee cart business. 

  
I keep seeing the setups and how all these coffee carts get started from a build standpoint. 

  
They are typically rocking a couple 5 gallon jugs of water underneath the cart, have pitcher wash, usually a little sink for washing hands underneath, their machines, and grinders, etc. And they can obviously swap out the 5 gallon jugs as they run low. 

  
This part all makes sense to me. But I was reading about licenses and permits and I see this 

  
DBPR’s “Mobile Food Dispensing Vehicle” license is specifically for **mobile food service** and requires things like proper handwashing/warewashing, food protection, and typically a **commissary arrangement** if you’re not fully self-sufficient.

  
And part of that requirement is being able to dump waste water - so hand washing and then the back flush from the coffee system. 

  
So my question are all the coffee carts using a commissary kitchen to handle this aspect? Or can they be considered 'self-sufficient'? 

  
Has anyone started their own coffee cart in FL and can walk me through the steps specific to a coffee cart from a licensing, permits, etc. standpoint? ",1,1770141021.0,florida,2,0.67,False

I’ve been hunting for some 'Daily Gold' lately. You know, those pieces you can actually wear to the office or a coffee run without looking like you’re headed to a wedding?

I was browsing Tanishq and found these two lightweight pieces that are perfect for a daily rotation. I’ll be honest, I always assumed the 'real' investment gold was just the heavy 916 hallmark sets my mom keeps in the locker, but these actually have the BIS hallmark logo stamped right on them. Real gold, just wearable.

Now I’m stuck in a scroll-hole and need a tie-breaker. Which vibe should I go with?

Option 1 (The Heart): Is this classic V-Day cute or am I overthinking it? It’s giving very 'Emily in Paris' romantic vibes, but I want to make sure it still feels sophisticated for work.

Option 2 (The Abstract Curve): This is definitely for the 'Clean Girl' / Corporate aesthetic. I feel like this would be so much easier to layer with my other chains?

Three Years Before Present Date Ellie Lark I run through the front yard to my door glancing quickly inside the silver car. The wind blows my ash blonde hair into my face and I swipe it away impatiently. Empty. Why didn’t she pick me up from school? Not like my sister at all. At almost twenty, she’s three years older than me and the most responsible big sister ever. I shut the door dropping my backpack on the floor. “Maura?” I call out heading for the kitchen. Empty. I race upstairs and hear faint music behind her door. Ah, she’s here, just didn’t answer me. She’s got werewolf hearing, so she knows I’m home and that I called her name. I knocked on and opened it a crack, calling her name. When I opened it wider, I saw her phone on the bed, the alarm playing the sound. I walk over to her bathroom. Empty. When I don’t find her anywhere, I walk out onto the porch avoiding the hole by the front door. “Maura?” Maybe she went for a walk. Or maybe Lesley picked her up and they went to get lunch. Usually she texts me though. She knows I worry that something happened to her otherwise. Three hours later, nothing still. Staring at my phone as I sit on the couch my unease continues to grow. I feel a weird tugging pain right below my left collarbone. It’s been there since right after I got to school this morning. Maybe I need to adjust my backpack strap or stop carrying so many books. It lingers though and I rub it absentmindedly. I lay down and close my eyes taking deep breaths trying to relax. I texted everyone looking for her. Her phone sits on the coffee table next to mine. When I open my eyes, it’s morning. I fell asleep. My phone is ringing, and I see Lydia’s name. “Anything El, she come home?” “No. I fell asleep on the couch. I’m scared Lydia. She left her phone here. This isn’t like Maura.” “It isn’t. Listen Harper is gone too.” I sit up straight my heart pounding. “What? When did she go missing?” “Yesterday, she never made it to school, and Nate said she didn’t come home at all either. She has her phone, though. Her parents went to Alpha Burton to report her missing.” Lydia’s voice trembles, which means she’s really scared. She’s never unconfident. “Mom seemed really scared, too.” And Rose is always calm. She’s been acting as our second mom for years. “I’ll call you El as soon as we hear anything. Mom is keeping her ears peeled at the packhouse.” All day, we hear nothing. I struggle to figure out what to do. The next morning, someone is banging loudly on my door. I hurry down from my bedroom and open it to see Nate, Harper, and Lydia standing there. Harper has been crying and they rush her inside. “Oh, Ellie. I’m so sorry. I saw it. Maura… she was banished from the pack.” “What?! Why?” I kneel in front of her. Harper’s big blue eyes are full of tears. “I have no idea why. But I saw Kincaid in wolf form haul her to the border and toss her over. Alpha was there and he banished her. Said something about her crimes against the pack. She was crying, begging to tell you goodbye. They wouldn’t let her. Burton said if she didn’t run, he was going to let the warriors hunt her for being a rogue on his pack border.” I sit back stunned. “I wanted to come tell you, but they saw me. I had to stay at the packhouse, and they questioned me about whether or not I was involved with her. Ellie, they never said what she did. She looked hurt though, like someone attacked her. I didn’t get close enough to really be able to tell.” Harper is sobbing now, and Nate holds her, rocking back and forth. What is going on? My sister works at the library for crying out loud and has never been involved in anything questionable. Hell, she never even broke curfew when our parents set it. An hour later, Harper is calmer, and we all sit in silence, trying to figure out what happened. A loud knock on the door has all of us jumping. Everyone recently got their wolves, but our heightened senses haven’t completely kicked in yet. I open the door and find Alpha Burton standing there. He looks past me at Harper and smiles slightly. “Ah, I am guessing Miss Simmons has already told you what I came for. May I come in, Ellie?” I bow my head nodding. “Yes, Alpha.” Like I can say no… He steps in, and they all rise quickly to bow their heads. “Ellie, I regret to tell you we discovered your sister was involved in a treasonous act with another pack. She has been banished per the pack laws and may not return. I must insist you let me know if she contacts you or if she sneaks into the pack. She is now a rogue, so that would be very… unfortunate for her, as you well know. Do I make myself clear?” “Yes, Alpha. May I ask what she did?” I ask timidly, hoping he will tell me. “No, I am afraid you may not. It is a matter of… security. I also came to offer you a room at the packhouse if you would rather stay there.” I look up into his expressionless eyes and begin, “I would rather remain here, Alpha. I will be ok.” “Very well. The offer is always open. I will be going. I trust I do not need to tell any of you that this is not to be discussed publicly.” We all agree quickly and watch him leave knowing we will never get an answer for why Maura had to leave. The hollow, empty feeling in my chest begins to be replaced with something else: rage. I hate this pack and cannot wait to leave it!",1,1770140887.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

When did she go missing?” “Yesterday, she never made it to school, and Nate said she didn’t come home at all either. She has her phone, though. Her parents went to Alpha Burton to report her missing.” Lydia’s voice trembles, which means she’s really scared. She’s never unconfident. “Mom seemed really scared, too.” And Rose is always calm. She’s been acting as our second mom for years. “I’ll call you El as soon as we hear anything. Mom is keeping her ears peeled at the packhouse.” All day, we hear nothing. I struggle to figure out what to do. The next morning, someone is banging loudly on my door. I hurry down from my bedroom and open it to see Nate, Harper, and Lydia standing there. Harper has been crying and they rush her inside. “Oh, Ellie. I’m so sorry. I saw it. Maura… she was banished from the pack.” “What?! Why?” I kneel in front of her. Harper’s big blue eyes are full of tears. “I have no idea why. But I saw Kincaid in wolf form haul her to the border and toss her over. Alpha was there and he banished her. Said something about her crimes against the pack. She was crying, begging to tell you goodbye. They wouldn’t let her. Burton said if she didn’t run, he was going to let the warriors hunt her for being a rogue on his pack border.” I sit back stunned. “I wanted to come tell you, but they saw me. I had to stay at the packhouse, and they questioned me about whether or not I was involved with her. Ellie, they never said what she did. She looked hurt though, like someone attacked her. I didn’t get close enough to really be able to tell.” Harper is sobbing now, and Nate holds her, rocking back and forth. What is going on? My sister works at the library for crying out loud and has never been involved in anything questionable. Hell, she never even broke curfew when our parents set it. An hour later, Harper is calmer, and we all sit in silence, trying to figure out what happened. A loud knock on the door has all of us jumping. Everyone recently got their wolves, but our heightened senses haven’t completely kicked in yet. I open the door and find Alpha Burton standing there. He looks past me at Harper and smiles slightly. “Ah, I am guessing Miss Simmons has already told you what I came for. May I come in, Ellie?” I bow my head nodding. “Yes, Alpha.” Like I can say no… He steps in, and they all rise quickly to bow their heads. “Ellie, I regret to tell you we discovered your sister was involved in a treasonous act with another pack. She has been banished per the pack laws and may not return. I must insist you let me know if she contacts you or if she sneaks into the pack. She is now a rogue, so that would be very… unfortunate for her, as you well know. Do I make myself clear?” “Yes, Alpha. May I ask what she did?” I ask timidly, hoping he will tell me. “No, I am afraid you may not. It is a matter of… security. I also came to offer you a room at the packhouse if you would rather stay there.” I look up into his expressionless eyes and begin, “I would rather remain here, Alpha. I will be ok.” “Very well. The offer is always open. I will be going. I trust I do not need to tell any of you that this is not to be discussed publicly.” We all agree quickly and watch him leave knowing we will never get an answer for why Maura had to leave. The hollow, empty feeling in my chest begins to be replaced with something else: rage. I hate this pack and cannot wait to leave it!",1,1770140881.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Three Years Before Present Date Ellie Lark I run through the front yard to my door glancing quickly inside the silver car. The wind blows my ash blonde hair into my face and I swipe it away impatiently. Empty. Why didn’t she pick me up from school? Not like my sister at all. At almost twenty, she’s three years older than me and the most responsible big sister ever. I shut the door dropping my backpack on the floor. “Maura?” I call out heading for the kitchen. Empty. I race upstairs and hear faint music behind her door. Ah, she’s here, just didn’t answer me. She’s got werewolf hearing, so she knows I’m home and that I called her name. I knocked on and opened it a crack, calling her name. When I opened it wider, I saw her phone on the bed, the alarm playing the sound. I walk over to her bathroom. Empty. When I don’t find her anywhere, I walk out onto the porch avoiding the hole by the front door. “Maura?” Maybe she went for a walk. Or maybe Lesley picked her up and they went to get lunch. Usually she texts me though. She knows I worry that something happened to her otherwise. Three hours later, nothing still. Staring at my phone as I sit on the couch my unease continues to grow. I feel a weird tugging pain right below my left collarbone. It’s been there since right after I got to school this morning. Maybe I need to adjust my backpack strap or stop carrying so many books. It lingers though and I rub it absentmindedly. I lay down and close my eyes taking deep breaths trying to relax. I texted everyone looking for her. Her phone sits on the coffee table next to mine. When I open my eyes, it’s morning. I fell asleep. My phone is ringing, and I see Lydia’s name. “Anything El, she come home?” “No. I fell asleep on the couch. I’m scared Lydia. She left her phone here. This isn’t like Maura.” “It isn’t. Listen Harper is gone too.” I sit up straight my heart pounding. “What?

I’ve just tried Yerba mate for the first time - went to the safest beginner option, Playadito. Oh man! It kicked my ass like a train! Mate is no joke! I thought I had pretty high caffeine tolerance, but I was wrong. Finished 50g gourd in 3 hours, with about 1 liter of water and I was hyperventilating all day 😅 and as far as I know Playadito is on the weaker side. So from now on I’ll switch to mate! Already ordered some different brands, like Liebig, Pajarito Compuesta, Amanda, Mate Rojo, La Merced and Kraus. It’s gonna be a great journey! ",5,1770140872.0,yerbamate,2,1.0,False

1quyr1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1quyr1f/popping_gasket_at_my_wits_end_delonghi_dedica/,Popping gasket - at my wits' end [Delonghi Dedica],"Hello kind espresso reddit folks! I need some guidance. My beloved second-hand EC680 Dedica has betrayed me. I've had it for about a year and while my problem is new to me, I do see from an extensive search through the sub that it's not uncommon. 

**The Issue:** The gasket is popping every single time I attempt a shot, seemingly irrespective of dose or grind size. 

**Solutions I've Tried:** 

* Changed the gasket; current gasket is less than 4 weeks old, looks visually intact every time I have re-seated it.
* Swapped back to stock pressurized PF
* Ground coarser to accommodate pressurized PF
* Reduced dose in the ""double"" (...ugh) basket to 10g
   * Coffee is freshly roasted, medium-dark, Brazil if it matters.
* Adjusting puck prep (tamp harder, softer, more wdt, no wdt)

**Other Info**: After swapping back to the stock PF, I was fine for about a week. I pull 2 ""double"" shots a day. With my bottomless PF I was using \~17g without choking the machine, but with the pressurized PF it chokes at 11g+ regardless of grind size. 

I clean the basket with soap & water daily - I don't *see* any clogs, water passes through fine with no grounds in the basket.

I **do** use a puck screen. I'm sort of ...we'll say particular... about grounds getting on the shower head, and since switching back to the stock PF, my grounds have been left particularly sloppy in the PF and it's a mess I don't want to deal with. However if that is a suspect variable I'll remove it (unhappily). 

So far as I can find, there are no non-commercial espresso machine repair shops near me. If this ends up being a problem that can't be solved by simple swaps that someone who isn't particularly mechanically gifted I'm not sure what the next step would be. 

If I've missed any pertinent information I am happy to add more; otherwise at this point I'm worried it's a lost cause for me. I got the machine for $40 which feels like I basically stole it, so a small repair expense isn't out of the question. 

Please help a girl out.

1quyoy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesToldWeirdly/comments/1quyoy1/veronica_chapman/,Veronica Chapman,"We met on the subway. She commented on a book I was reading. She'd read it too, she said. That was rare. We exchanged contact information and kept in touch for a few weeks. Then we decided to have coffee together. Nothing fancy, a no pressure meet-up at a little waterfront cafe with good online reviews. I ordered an Americano. She ordered a cinnamon flavoured latte. “It's nice to see you again,” I said when she sat down. “Likewise,” she said. It was just after six o'clock on a Tuesday evening. Her name was Veronica Chapman.

She was sweet, confident without being arrogant, willing to listen as well as speak. She had brown eyes and light hair, which I note not because I fell in love with her but because I *don't* have brown eyes and light hair, and I need to remind myself that she and I are not the same person, even though it sometimes feels like we are, and Norman never did believe that we met by chance that afternoon on the subway, but that is how it happened, and how it happened led to our date in the coffee shop.

“What else do you read?” I asked.

“Oh, anything,” said Norman.

“Really?”

“Unless it was published after 1995. Then I wouldn't read it,” I said.

“So, not into contemporary lit,” said Veronica Chapman.

“Not really,” I said.

“Shame.”

“Why's that?” Norman asked.

“Because I'm a bit of a writer myself, and I was hoping you might like reading what I write,” I said. “I'm no Faulkner, but I'm not bad either.”

“Some people might say if you're not like Faulkner, that makes you good,” he said.

“Would you say that, Norman?” she asked.

“I wouldn't,” I said. “I like Faulkner.”

“Me too.”

I wanted to say: I write too; but I took a drink of coffee instead. It was good. The reviews didn't lie. I let the taste overcome my tongue before swallowing. “I write too,” I said. “Not for money or anything. Just for fun. What do you write—are you published?” I asked.

“Self-published,” she said.

“And I write stories. I post them online. Maybe it's silly. I had a Tumblr. Before that, a MySpace page.”

“I don't think it's silly. Not at all,” said Norman.

“Thanks,” I said.

She sipped her latte. “MySpace. Wow. You must have been writing for a while,” he added.

“Yeah.”

“What genre do you write in?”

“I've tried a few, but what I write doesn't usually fall into any one genre. It's kind of funny but also kind of horrific, sometimes absurd. Sometimes it's whatever I happen to be reading, like, by reading I'm eating an author's style—which I then regurgitate back onto the page.”

“I know what you mean. I do that too. It's like I'm a literary sponge.”

“What makes my writing mine is the setting: the world I set my stories in. Everything else is borrowed.”

“What's the setting?” I asked.

“A place called New Zork City,” said Veronica Chapman.

I nearly spat my Americano into her smiling face. I must have misheard.  “New *York* City?” I said.

“No, not New *York*. New *Zork*.” She must have seen my expression change: to one of shock—disbelief. “It's like New York but isn't New York. It's like a bizarro version of New York City. Not that I've ever been to New York City,” she said, to which I said: “I write New Zork City.”

“Pardon?”

“New *Zork* City—Zork: like the old text adventure game. *I* write stories set in New Zork City.”

“I write New Zork City.”

“Here. Look,” I said, pulling out my phone, opening my personal subreddit. “See? All these stories are set in New Zork. It's my world, not yours.”

“When did you write your first New Zork story?”

“Angles,” I said. “Two years ago.”

“Moises Maloney, acutization, the old man from Old New Zork, his exploding head, Thelma Baker, deadly nostalgia,” said Veronica Chapman.

“That's right,” I said.

“I wrote that one over a decade ago, and it wasn't even my first story.” She showed me her Tumblr. There it was: my story, *i.e.* her story, word-for-word the same but posted in 2014. I couldn't argue with a timestamp.

“That's impossible,” I said.

She said, “I wrote my first one in elementary school, a poem that referenced Rooklyn.”

And she showed that to me too. It was a photo of a handwritten piece of paper, the writing neat but obviously a child's,  predating my version of “Angles” by nearly a lifetime. “It's—” I started to say, to dispute: but dispute what? If the poem had been printed I could have argued it was a typo, automatic capitalisation, but it wasn't. “That could have been written at any time,” I said, and I pulled out an elementary school yearbook from the nineteen-nineties, in which the poem had been reproduced, and showed it to Norman Crane, who was speechless, his eyes darting from the yearbook to me, to the yearbook to—

“You came prepared,” he said in the tone of an accusation. “Nobody just walks around with a copy of their eighth grade yearbook. You sought me out. We didn't meet by coincidence. What is this? Who are you, and what the hell do you want from me?”

He was obviously distressed.

“No, it wasn't a coincidence,” I conceded. “I came across your stories online a few months ago and recognised them as my stories,” I told him. “Why are you ripping me off?”

“Me? I'm—I'm not ripping you off! My stories are my own: originals.”

“Yet they're clearly not,” said Veronica Chapman, and somewhere deep down I knew she was right. I mean: I wrote them, but they had come to me too easily, too fully formed. I had merely transcribed them.

“I'm not angry. I just want you to stop,” she said.

Then she bent forward and put one hand under the table we were sitting on opposite sides of.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“I have a gun,” she whispered, and I felt sweat start to run down the back of my neck, and I felt my hand hold the gun under the table pointed at Norman, and I felt having Veronica Chapman point the gun at me. “I know you have a good imagination,” she said. “Which means I know it doesn't matter whether I actually have a gun or not. You can imagine I do, and that's enough. In fact, you can't help but imagine it. You're probably trying to visualize what it looks like—the sound it would make if I pulled the trigger—how much it would hurt to get shot, how your body would be pushed back by the impact. You're imagining what the reactions would be: mine, everyone else's. You're imagining the blood, the wound, the beautiful warmth; pressing your hand against it, seeing yourself bleed out…”

“And all you want is for me to stop writing stories about New Zork City,” I said.

She was right: I couldn't stop imagining.

“Yes, that's all I want from you,” I said, keeping the imagined gun trained on Norman. “They're not your stories. Stop pretending they are.”

Norman squirmed.

To everybody else in the coffee place we were just two people on a date.

“Finish your Americano, forget New Zork and go on with the rest of your life. Imagine this never happened,” I said. “That's safest for both of us.”

“Even if you did write the stories first—”

“I did,” she said.

“Fine. You wrote them first. But how do you know nobody wrote them before you did? Maybe your claim to them is no better than mine.”

Veronica Chapman laughed. “It's not just about who's first, Norman. It's about power: the power of imagination. I bet, until now, you've never met anyone who could imagine the way you can. That's fair. You're not bad, Norman. You're not bad at all—but you're not the best, and New Zork City belongs to the best.”

All I could do was watch her.

“What's the source?” I asked finally, imagining her as a girl standing over my dead body, sitting down, putting a notebook filled with lined sheets of paper on my chest and writing her poem about Rooklyn. “Where does it all come from? To me, to you…”

“I don't know.”

“How many others have you found?”

“Three.”

“And how did—”

“They were persuadable.”

I didn't believe her. I didn't believe there were others. I didn't  believe her imagination was greater than mine. I didn't believe in her at all.

“Do you agree to stop writing New Zork City, Norman?” she asked.

“No,” I said.

“Then give me your hand,” she said, holding out the one she wasn't using to maybe-threaten me with a gun. “We'll have a battle of imaginations.”

“What?”

“We hold hands and try to imagine the world, each without the other.”

“Put away the gun,” I said.

“What gun?” Both her hands were on the table. She was finishing up her latte. I still had a third of my cooling Americano. “There is no gun.”

If I could imagine the Karma Police, a conquistador in Maninatinhat, a Voidberg, surely I can imagine a world without Veronica Chapman, I thought and took her hand in mine. Squeezing, we both closed our eyes. How romantic. How utterly, perversely romantic. But try as I might, I couldn't do it: I couldn't imagine Veronica Chapman out of existence. She was always there, on the margins. Even when I was writing, whispering into my ear. Maybe I *was* in love with her. Maybe. Whispering, whispering, Norman with his two eyes closed, Norman squeezing my hand, his grip getting weaker and weaker until there is no grip—until there is no Norman, and I get up and pay for my latte and the unfinished Americano in the cup on the other side of the empty table.

“I guess he didn't show up,” says the barista.

“Yeah,” I say.

“His loss, I'm sure.”

“Thanks. It's probably not the last time I'll be stood up,” I say with a shrug, and I go home. I go home to write.",1,1770140699.0,TalesToldWeirdly,1,1.0,False

# A compact 128Wh power station with fast charging, UPS support, and excellent portability for everyday backup and travel

[BUY FROM AMAZON](https://amzn.to/3ZbhsFP)

I’ve been using BLUETTI charging stations for several years, and they have consistently been reliable. Whenever there’s a chance of a power outage, I make sure our units are fully charged. The main drawback I’ve experienced with larger BLUETTI stations is their weight and how difficult they can be to move around. Fortunately, the Elite 10 Mini Power Station is an excellent solution to that problem.

# About the BLUETTI Elite 10 Mini Power Station

The BLUETTI Elite 10 Mini Power Station is a compact and lightweight portable power solution designed for everyday carry, travel, and short-term backup needs. With a 128Wh LiFePO₄ battery and a 200W AC output, it bridges the gap between a traditional power bank and a full-size power station by offering true AC power in a highly portable form factor.

It can power small electronics like laptops, tablets, cameras, routers, and other low-wattage devices, making it a practical option for remote work, camping, or emergency preparedness.

Additional features such as multiple output ports, a built-in LED light with emergency modes, and UPS functionality for sensitive electronics add to its versatility. While it is not intended for high-draw appliances, the BLUETTI Elite 10 Mini excels as a grab-and-go power station for users who need dependable, portable energy without bulk or complexity.

# User Experience

The BLUETTI Elite 10 Mini arrives in a simple brown cardboard box with the Bluetti logo and product name clearly printed on the outside. Opening the box reveals a clean, well-organized layout, with the power station securely packed alongside its accessories. Inside, you’ll find the Elite 10 Mini power station, an AC charging cable, a car charging cable, and a user manual, providing everything needed to get started right out of the box.

The BLUETTI Elite 10 Mini makes a very strong first impression. The unit is impressively lightweight, making it easy to pick up and move around using the built-in handle without feeling cumbersome. Its compact size makes it well suited for travel, desk use, or quick grab-and-go situations. One minor drawback is the lack of onboard storage for charging cables, which would have helped keep everything organized in one place. On the positive side, the color choice is refreshingly unique and a welcome change from the standard dark gray finishes commonly seen on portable power stations.

Field testing focused on both AC and DC performance to evaluate real-world power delivery. For the AC test, an Anker 140W charger was plugged into the AC outlet to compare the wattage reported by the charger with the output shown on the Bluetti display. While charging an iPhone 16 Pro, both devices consistently reported an output of 10 to 15 watts, indicating accurate power reporting and stable AC output. For the DC test, the iPhone 16 Pro was connected directly to the 100W USB-C port using a 240W USB4 cable to ensure the highest possible charging performance. A 30-minute timed charging test was then conducted to measure charging speed, power draw, and overall efficiency.

**Charging Test Results**

In a 30-minute timed charging test, the BLUETTI Elite 10 Mini delivered consistent and efficient performance when charging my iPhone. Starting at 17 percent, the phone reached 68 percent battery in just half an hour. Output initially peaked at 19W before gradually tapering to 11W, which aligns with normal fast-charging behavior as the phone battery fills.

During the test, the power station’s battery level dropped from nearly full to 92 percent, representing an approximate 8 percent usage. This indicates solid efficiency for USB charging, with minimal energy loss and stable power delivery throughout the session. Overall, the results show that the Elite 10 Mini is well suited for quickly charging smartphones and other small electronics without excessive drain on its internal battery.

1quyoaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1quyoaa/veronica_chapman/,Veronica Chapman,"We met on the subway. She commented on a book I was reading. She'd read it too, she said. That was rare. We exchanged contact information and kept in touch for a few weeks. Then we decided to have coffee together. Nothing fancy, a no pressure meet-up at a little waterfront cafe with good online reviews. I ordered an Americano. She ordered a cinnamon flavoured latte. “It's nice to see you again,” I said when she sat down. “Likewise,” she said. It was just after six o'clock on a Tuesday evening. Her name was Veronica Chapman.

She was sweet, confident without being arrogant, willing to listen as well as speak. She had brown eyes and light hair, which I note not because I fell in love with her but because I *don't* have brown eyes and light hair, and I need to remind myself that she and I are not the same person, even though it sometimes feels like we are, and Norman never did believe that we met by chance that afternoon on the subway, but that is how it happened, and how it happened led to our date in the coffee shop.

“What else do you read?” I asked.

“Oh, anything,” said Norman.

“Really?”

“Unless it was published after 1995. Then I wouldn't read it,” I said.

“So, not into contemporary lit,” said Veronica Chapman.

“Not really,” I said.

“Shame.”

“Why's that?” Norman asked.

“Because I'm a bit of a writer myself, and I was hoping you might like reading what I write,” I said. “I'm no Faulkner, but I'm not bad either.”

“Some people might say if you're not like Faulkner, that makes you good,” he said.

“Would you say that, Norman?” she asked.

“I wouldn't,” I said. “I like Faulkner.”

“Me too.”

I wanted to say: I write too; but I took a drink of coffee instead. It was good. The reviews didn't lie. I let the taste overcome my tongue before swallowing. “I write too,” I said. “Not for money or anything. Just for fun. What do you write—are you published?” I asked.

“Self-published,” she said.

“And I write stories. I post them online. Maybe it's silly. I had a Tumblr. Before that, a MySpace page.”

“I don't think it's silly. Not at all,” said Norman.

“Thanks,” I said.

She sipped her latte. “MySpace. Wow. You must have been writing for a while,” he added.

“Yeah.”

“What genre do you write in?”

“I've tried a few, but what I write doesn't usually fall into any one genre. It's kind of funny but also kind of horrific, sometimes absurd. Sometimes it's whatever I happen to be reading, like, by reading I'm eating an author's style—which I then regurgitate back onto the page.”

“I know what you mean. I do that too. It's like I'm a literary sponge.”

“What makes my writing mine is the setting: the world I set my stories in. Everything else is borrowed.”

“What's the setting?” I asked.

“A place called New Zork City,” said Veronica Chapman.

I nearly spat my Americano into her smiling face. I must have misheard.  “New *York* City?” I said.

“No, not New *York*. New *Zork*.” She must have seen my expression change: to one of shock—disbelief. “It's like New York but isn't New York. It's like a bizarro version of New York City. Not that I've ever been to New York City,” she said, to which I said: “I write New Zork City.”

“Pardon?”

“New *Zork* City—Zork: like the old text adventure game. *I* write stories set in New Zork City.”

“I write New Zork City.”

“Here. Look,” I said, pulling out my phone, opening my personal subreddit. “See? All these stories are set in New Zork. It's my world, not yours.”

“When did you write your first New Zork story?”

“Angles,” I said. “Two years ago.”

“Moises Maloney, acutization, the old man from Old New Zork, his exploding head, Thelma Baker, deadly nostalgia,” said Veronica Chapman.

“That's right,” I said.

“I wrote that one over a decade ago, and it wasn't even my first story.” She showed me her Tumblr. There it was: my story, *i.e.* her story, word-for-word the same but posted in 2014. I couldn't argue with a timestamp.

“That's impossible,” I said.

She said, “I wrote my first one in elementary school, a poem that referenced Rooklyn.”

And she showed that to me too. It was a photo of a handwritten piece of paper, the writing neat but obviously a child's,  predating my version of “Angles” by nearly a lifetime. “It's—” I started to say, to dispute: but dispute what? If the poem had been printed I could have argued it was a typo, automatic capitalisation, but it wasn't. “That could have been written at any time,” I said, and I pulled out an elementary school yearbook from the nineteen-nineties, in which the poem had been reproduced, and showed it to Norman Crane, who was speechless, his eyes darting from the yearbook to me, to the yearbook to—

“You came prepared,” he said in the tone of an accusation. “Nobody just walks around with a copy of their eighth grade yearbook. You sought me out. We didn't meet by coincidence. What is this? Who are you, and what the hell do you want from me?”

He was obviously distressed.

“No, it wasn't a coincidence,” I conceded. “I came across your stories online a few months ago and recognised them as my stories,” I told him. “Why are you ripping me off?”

“Me? I'm—I'm not ripping you off! My stories are my own: originals.”

“Yet they're clearly not,” said Veronica Chapman, and somewhere deep down I knew she was right. I mean: I wrote them, but they had come to me too easily, too fully formed. I had merely transcribed them.

“I'm not angry. I just want you to stop,” she said.

Then she bent forward and put one hand under the table we were sitting on opposite sides of.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“I have a gun,” she whispered, and I felt sweat start to run down the back of my neck, and I felt my hand hold the gun under the table pointed at Norman, and I felt having Veronica Chapman point the gun at me. “I know you have a good imagination,” she said. “Which means I know it doesn't matter whether I actually have a gun or not. You can imagine I do, and that's enough. In fact, you can't help but imagine it. You're probably trying to visualize what it looks like—the sound it would make if I pulled the trigger—how much it would hurt to get shot, how your body would be pushed back by the impact. You're imagining what the reactions would be: mine, everyone else's. You're imagining the blood, the wound, the beautiful warmth; pressing your hand against it, seeing yourself bleed out…”

“And all you want is for me to stop writing stories about New Zork City,” I said.

She was right: I couldn't stop imagining.

“Yes, that's all I want from you,” I said, keeping the imagined gun trained on Norman. “They're not your stories. Stop pretending they are.”

Norman squirmed.

To everybody else in the coffee place we were just two people on a date.

“Finish your Americano, forget New Zork and go on with the rest of your life. Imagine this never happened,” I said. “That's safest for both of us.”

“Even if you did write the stories first—”

“I did,” she said.

“Fine. You wrote them first. But how do you know nobody wrote them before you did? Maybe your claim to them is no better than mine.”

Veronica Chapman laughed. “It's not just about who's first, Norman. It's about power: the power of imagination. I bet, until now, you've never met anyone who could imagine the way you can. That's fair. You're not bad, Norman. You're not bad at all—but you're not the best, and New Zork City belongs to the best.”

All I could do was watch her.

“What's the source?” I asked finally, imagining her as a girl standing over my dead body, sitting down, putting a notebook filled with lined sheets of paper on my chest and writing her poem about Rooklyn. “Where does it all come from? To me, to you…”

“I don't know.”

“How many others have you found?”

“Three.”

“And how did—”

“They were persuadable.”

I didn't believe her. I didn't believe there were others. I didn't  believe her imagination was greater than mine. I didn't believe in her at all.

“Do you agree to stop writing New Zork City, Norman?” she asked.

“No,” I said.

“Then give me your hand,” she said, holding out the one she wasn't using to maybe-threaten me with a gun. “We'll have a battle of imaginations.”

“What?”

“We hold hands and try to imagine the world, each without the other.”

“Put away the gun,” I said.

“What gun?” Both her hands were on the table. She was finishing up her latte. I still had a third of my cooling Americano. “There is no gun.”

If I could imagine the Karma Police, a conquistador in Maninatinhat, a Voidberg, surely I can imagine a world without Veronica Chapman, I thought and took her hand in mine. Squeezing, we both closed our eyes. How romantic. How utterly, perversely romantic. But try as I might, I couldn't do it: I couldn't imagine Veronica Chapman out of existence. She was always there, on the margins. Even when I was writing, whispering into my ear. Maybe I *was* in love with her. Maybe. Whispering, whispering, Norman with his two eyes closed, Norman squeezing my hand, his grip getting weaker and weaker until there is no grip—until there is no Norman, and I get up and pay for my latte and the unfinished Americano in the cup on the other side of the empty table.

“I guess he didn't show up,” says the barista.

“Yeah,” I say.

“His loss, I'm sure.”

“Thanks. It's probably not the last time I'll be stood up,” I say with a shrug, and I go home. I go home to write.",1,1770140660.0,libraryofshadows,1,1.0,False

1quynmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1quynmr/the_psychology_of_real_optimism_how_to_rewire/,The Psychology of Real Optimism: How to Rewire Your Brain Without Toxic Positivity,"So I used to be that person who'd roll my eyes at  good vibes only  posts. I thought optimism was just... fake? Like people were lying to themselves. But then I realized I was exhausted from my own negativity. Everything felt heavy, you know?

I've spent the last year diving deep into this, reading research, listening to psychology podcasts, testing different approaches. Turns out, real optimism isn't about pretending everything's fine. It's about rewiring how your brain processes reality. And honestly? The science behind it is wild.

Here's what actually worked:

**Your brain has a negativity bias, it's literally designed to focus on threats.** Back when we were avoiding predators, this kept us alive. Now it just makes us doom scroll and catastrophize about texts. [Dr. Rick Hanson](https://rickhanson.com/books/hardwiring-happiness/) (neuropsychologist) calls this  Velcro for negative experiences, Teflon for positive ones  in his research. The fix? You have to actively train your brain to hold onto positive moments. When something good happens, even tiny stuff like your coffee tasting perfect, pause for 15-20 seconds. Let it sink in. This actually changes your brain structure over time. Sounds too simple but it works.

**Stop trying to  think positive  when bad stuff happens.** Instead, get curious. I learned this from  [The Optimism Bias](https://talisharot.com/books/the-optimism-bias/)  by Tali Sharot (she's a cognitive neuroscientist at MIT, the book won multiple awards and completely changed how I see optimism). She explains that optimistic people don't deny reality, they just interpret it differently. They ask  what can I learn?  instead of  why does this always happen to me?  The book shows how optimism is actually rooted in how our brains predict the future, backed by brain imaging studies. Insanely good read, especially the chapters on how optimism affects decision making and health outcomes. This is the best neuroscience book on optimism I've ever read, it'll make you question everything you think you know about positive thinking.

\*\*Track your  explanatory style. \*\* Pessimists explain bad events as permanent, personal, and pervasive.  I failed because I'm stupid (personal), I always mess up (permanent), nothing ever works out (pervasive).  Optimists do the opposite. They see setbacks as temporary, specific, and external when appropriate. I started catching myself mid-spiral and reframing. Not lying, just being more accurate. Like instead of  I'm terrible at relationships,  it became  that relationship didn't work because we wanted different things.

If you want to go deeper on rewiring thought patterns but don't have the time or energy to read through dense psychology books, there's this smart learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-le) that's been helpful. Built by a team from Columbia and former Google experts, it pulls from books, research papers, and expert insights on topics like cognitive behavioral therapy and optimism science, then generates personalized audio content based on your specific goals. You can set something like  I'm naturally pessimistic and want to build genuine optimism without toxic positivity,  and it'll create a structured learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes dense psychology concepts way more digestible during your commute or at the gym.

**Use the app Finch for habit building around positivity practices.** It's this cute little bird that grows as you complete self care tasks. Sounds childish but it genuinely helped me build a gratitude practice without feeling forced. You can set daily reminders for things like  name 3 good things  or  do something kind.  The dopamine hit from watching your bird thrive is real, and it makes positive habits actually stick.

**Consume better media.** I'm serious about this. I used to watch true crime docs every night and wonder why I felt paranoid. Started listening to The Happiness Lab podcast with Dr. Laurie Santos (Yale professor who teaches the most popular course in Yale history on happiness). She breaks down the science of wellbeing in 30 min episodes with actual research, not fluffy self help BS. Episodes on social connection and gratitude practices are chef's kiss. Also Unlocking Us with Brené Brown for understanding how vulnerability connects to joy. Her episode on  foreboding joy  explained why I'd been sabotaging good moments my whole life.

\*\*Practice  tragic optimism. \*\* This concept from Viktor Frankl (Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist) changed everything for me. It means finding meaning and hope even when facing unavoidable suffering. Not toxic positivity that ignores pain, but choosing to find purpose within it.  Man's Search for Meaning  is obviously essential reading here, under 200 pages but will hit you like a truck. If a man can find meaning in a concentration camp, I can probably handle my regular life problems with more grace.

**Get your sleep and exercise dialed in.** Yeah yeah, boring advice, but sleep deprivation literally impairs your prefrontal cortex, the part that helps you regulate emotions and think rationally. When I'm tired, everything feels impossible. When I've slept well and moved my body, the same problems feel manageable. It's not willpower, it's biology.

**Audit your relationships.** Negativity is contagious, but so is optimism. I noticed I felt drained after hanging out with certain people who only complained. Not saying ditch your friends when they're struggling, but if someone's default mode is cynicism and they shoot down any positive reframe you attempt, that's affecting your own outlook. Spend more time with people who can hold both, who can validate hard emotions AND still find hope.

**Use the app Insight Timer for meditation.** Free, thousands of guided meditations including ones specifically for cultivating positive emotions. The  Loving Kindness  meditations felt cringe at first but they actually work. Research shows they increase activity in brain regions associated with empathy and positive emotion. I like the ones by Tara Brach, she has a soothing voice and doesn't make it feel woo woo.

The thing nobody tells you: becoming more optimistic might piss some people off. Misery loves company. Some people bonded with you over shared cynicism and they'll feel weird when you stop participating. That's their stuff, not yours.

Also, optimism doesn't mean never feeling sad or scared. It means trusting that you can handle hard things. It means believing that suffering isn't the only story. The science shows optimists live longer, have better immune systems, recover faster from setbacks. But beyond that, life just feels lighter when you're not carrying around the weight of assuming everything will go wrong.

You're not broken if you skew negative. Your brain's doing what it evolved to do. But you can work with it, train it, slowly shift the baseline. It takes time though. Neuroplasticity is real but it's not instant. Be patient with yourself.",1,1770140619.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

1quymu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyersBeachFL/comments/1quymu5/mid_feb_vacay_need_recs/,Mid Feb Vacay - Need Recs,"My family and I are staying in Fort Myers from Saturday-Saturday in the middle of February 2026. Some of us have never visited this area before - others only once. We typically go to FL to the Key’s, but because it’s 4 of us - we decided to go somewhere else this year to do something budget friendly because the Key’s is always packed and is always crazy expensive. 

Some things that we are looking for as new travelers to the Fort:

1. Food recommendations for people who like seafood but can also have other options for people who don’t. We typically are okay spending $10-$40 a head w/drinks. 

2. Beaches that are clean and dog friendly. Preferably not too crowded. The current place we are staying has a beach access - but we are unsure since hurricane damage that it will be clean or not. If you search Flamingo Street and Estero Blvd - it’s about that area where we are staying. 

3. Fruit stands. We love fresh fruit and vegetables and would prefer to not get them from the store. 

4. Coffee. Many of us are coffee snobs and will be looking for recs on coffee. I am preferable to Matcha and Chai so a decent coffee house with a breakfast sandwich is dope. 

5. Fishing spots. We are renting a boat and have been gathering fishing gear for such cause. We can fish off of a pier that we are staying on - but the boat is so we can go swimming AND fish. So if there are any good spots that avid fishers know where to go and what bait to buy - that’d be sweet. 

6. Things we need to know in general - like is there a night market, what things to look for when swimming or on the beach, where to groceries when it’s late, where to hit a dessert place after dinner, etc. 

I understand this is a lot to ask for - but we may or may not be coming down to Fort Myers more often because although we love the Key’s - we are looking for other options based on what other places offer. THANKS!

1quympi,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1quympi/veronica_chapman/,Veronica Chapman,"We met on the subway. She commented on a book I was reading. She'd read it too, she said. That was rare. We exchanged contact information and kept in touch for a few weeks. Then we decided to have coffee together. Nothing fancy, a no pressure meet-up at a little waterfront cafe with good online reviews. I ordered an Americano. She ordered a cinnamon flavoured latte. “It's nice to see you again,” I said when she sat down. “Likewise,” she said. It was just after six o'clock on a Tuesday evening. Her name was Veronica Chapman.

She was sweet, confident without being arrogant, willing to listen as well as speak. She had brown eyes and light hair, which I note not because I fell in love with her but because I *don't* have brown eyes and light hair, and I need to remind myself that she and I are not the same person, even though it sometimes feels like we are, and Norman never did believe that we met by chance that afternoon on the subway, but that is how it happened, and how it happened led to our date in the coffee shop.

“What else do you read?” I asked.

“Oh, anything,” said Norman.

“Really?”

“Unless it was published after 1995. Then I wouldn't read it,” I said.

“So, not into contemporary lit,” said Veronica Chapman.

“Not really,” I said.

“Shame.”

“Why's that?” Norman asked.

“Because I'm a bit of a writer myself, and I was hoping you might like reading what I write,” I said. “I'm no Faulkner, but I'm not bad either.”

“Some people might say if you're not like Faulkner, that makes you good,” he said.

“Would you say that, Norman?” she asked.

“I wouldn't,” I said. “I like Faulkner.”

“Me too.”

I wanted to say: I write too; but I took a drink of coffee instead. It was good. The reviews didn't lie. I let the taste overcome my tongue before swallowing. “I write too,” I said. “Not for money or anything. Just for fun. What do you write—are you published?” I asked.

“Self-published,” she said.

“And I write stories. I post them online. Maybe it's silly. I had a Tumblr. Before that, a MySpace page.”

“I don't think it's silly. Not at all,” said Norman.

“Thanks,” I said.

She sipped her latte. “MySpace. Wow. You must have been writing for a while,” he added.

“Yeah.”

“What genre do you write in?”

“I've tried a few, but what I write doesn't usually fall into any one genre. It's kind of funny but also kind of horrific, sometimes absurd. Sometimes it's whatever I happen to be reading, like, by reading I'm eating an author's style—which I then regurgitate back onto the page.”

“I know what you mean. I do that too. It's like I'm a literary sponge.”

“What makes my writing mine is the setting: the world I set my stories in. Everything else is borrowed.”

“What's the setting?” I asked.

“A place called New Zork City,” said Veronica Chapman.

I nearly spat my Americano into her smiling face. I must have misheard.  “New *York* City?” I said.

“No, not New *York*. New *Zork*.” She must have seen my expression change: to one of shock—disbelief. “It's like New York but isn't New York. It's like a bizarro version of New York City. Not that I've ever been to New York City,” she said, to which I said: “I write New Zork City.”

“Pardon?”

“New *Zork* City—Zork: like the old text adventure game. *I* write stories set in New Zork City.”

“I write New Zork City.”

“Here. Look,” I said, pulling out my phone, opening my personal subreddit. “See? All these stories are set in New Zork. It's my world, not yours.”

“When did you write your first New Zork story?”

“Angles,” I said. “Two years ago.”

“Moises Maloney, acutization, the old man from Old New Zork, his exploding head, Thelma Baker, deadly nostalgia,” said Veronica Chapman.

“That's right,” I said.

“I wrote that one over a decade ago, and it wasn't even my first story.” She showed me her Tumblr. There it was: my story, *i.e.* her story, word-for-word the same but posted in 2014. I couldn't argue with a timestamp.

“That's impossible,” I said.

She said, “I wrote my first one in elementary school, a poem that referenced Rooklyn.”

And she showed that to me too. It was a photo of a handwritten piece of paper, the writing neat but obviously a child's,  predating my version of “Angles” by nearly a lifetime. “It's—” I started to say, to dispute: but dispute what? If the poem had been printed I could have argued it was a typo, automatic capitalisation, but it wasn't. “That could have been written at any time,” I said, and I pulled out an elementary school yearbook from the nineteen-nineties, in which the poem had been reproduced, and showed it to Norman Crane, who was speechless, his eyes darting from the yearbook to me, to the yearbook to—

“You came prepared,” he said in the tone of an accusation. “Nobody just walks around with a copy of their eighth grade yearbook. You sought me out. We didn't meet by coincidence. What is this? Who are you, and what the hell do you want from me?”

He was obviously distressed.

“No, it wasn't a coincidence,” I conceded. “I came across your stories online a few months ago and recognised them as my stories,” I told him. “Why are you ripping me off?”

“Me? I'm—I'm not ripping you off! My stories are my own: originals.”

“Yet they're clearly not,” said Veronica Chapman, and somewhere deep down I knew she was right. I mean: I wrote them, but they had come to me too easily, too fully formed. I had merely transcribed them.

“I'm not angry. I just want you to stop,” she said.

Then she bent forward and put one hand under the table we were sitting on opposite sides of.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“I have a gun,” she whispered, and I felt sweat start to run down the back of my neck, and I felt my hand hold the gun under the table pointed at Norman, and I felt having Veronica Chapman point the gun at me. “I know you have a good imagination,” she said. “Which means I know it doesn't matter whether I actually have a gun or not. You can imagine I do, and that's enough. In fact, you can't help but imagine it. You're probably trying to visualize what it looks like—the sound it would make if I pulled the trigger—how much it would hurt to get shot, how your body would be pushed back by the impact. You're imagining what the reactions would be: mine, everyone else's. You're imagining the blood, the wound, the beautiful warmth; pressing your hand against it, seeing yourself bleed out…”

“And all you want is for me to stop writing stories about New Zork City,” I said.

She was right: I couldn't stop imagining.

“Yes, that's all I want from you,” I said, keeping the imagined gun trained on Norman. “They're not your stories. Stop pretending they are.”

Norman squirmed.

To everybody else in the coffee place we were just two people on a date.

“Finish your Americano, forget New Zork and go on with the rest of your life. Imagine this never happened,” I said. “That's safest for both of us.”

“Even if you did write the stories first—”

“I did,” she said.

“Fine. You wrote them first. But how do you know nobody wrote them before you did? Maybe your claim to them is no better than mine.”

Veronica Chapman laughed. “It's not just about who's first, Norman. It's about power: the power of imagination. I bet, until now, you've never met anyone who could imagine the way you can. That's fair. You're not bad, Norman. You're not bad at all—but you're not the best, and New Zork City belongs to the best.”

All I could do was watch her.

“What's the source?” I asked finally, imagining her as a girl standing over my dead body, sitting down, putting a notebook filled with lined sheets of paper on my chest and writing her poem about Rooklyn. “Where does it all come from? To me, to you…”

“I don't know.”

“How many others have you found?”

“Three.”

“And how did—”

“They were persuadable.”

I didn't believe her. I didn't believe there were others. I didn't  believe her imagination was greater than mine. I didn't believe in her at all.

“Do you agree to stop writing New Zork City, Norman?” she asked.

“No,” I said.

“Then give me your hand,” she said, holding out the one she wasn't using to maybe-threaten me with a gun. “We'll have a battle of imaginations.”

“What?”

“We hold hands and try to imagine the world, each without the other.”

“Put away the gun,” I said.

“What gun?” Both her hands were on the table. She was finishing up her latte. I still had a third of my cooling Americano. “There is no gun.”

If I could imagine the Karma Police, a conquistador in Maninatinhat, a Voidberg, surely I can imagine a world without Veronica Chapman, I thought and took her hand in mine. Squeezing, we both closed our eyes. How romantic. How utterly, perversely romantic. But try as I might, I couldn't do it: I couldn't imagine Veronica Chapman out of existence.

“Finish your Americano, forget New Zork and go on with the rest of your life. Imagine this never happened,” I said. “That's safest for both of us.”

“Even if you did write the stories first—”

“I did,” she said.

“Fine. You wrote them first. But how do you know nobody wrote them before you did? Maybe your claim to them is no better than mine.”

Veronica Chapman laughed. “It's not just about who's first, Norman. It's about power: the power of imagination. I bet, until now, you've never met anyone who could imagine the way you can. That's fair. You're not bad, Norman. You're not bad at all—but you're not the best, and New Zork City belongs to the best.”

All I could do was watch her.

“What's the source?” I asked finally, imagining her as a girl standing over my dead body, sitting down, putting a notebook filled with lined sheets of paper on my chest and writing her poem about Rooklyn. “Where does it all come from? To me, to you…”

“I don't know.”

“How many others have you found?”

“Three.”

“And how did—”

“They were persuadable.”

I didn't believe her. I didn't believe there were others. I didn't  believe her imagination was greater than mine. I didn't believe in her at all.

“Do you agree to stop writing New Zork City, Norman?” she asked.

“No,” I said.

“Then give me your hand,” she said, holding out the one she wasn't using to maybe-threaten me with a gun. “We'll have a battle of imaginations.”

“What?”

“We hold hands and try to imagine the world, each without the other.”

“Put away the gun,” I said.

“What gun?” Both her hands were on the table. She was finishing up her latte. I still had a third of my cooling Americano. “There is no gun.”

If I could imagine the Karma Police, a conquistador in Maninatinhat, a Voidberg, surely I can imagine a world without Veronica Chapman, I thought and took her hand in mine. Squeezing, we both closed our eyes. How romantic. How utterly, perversely romantic. But try as I might, I couldn't do it: I couldn't imagine Veronica Chapman out of existence. She was always there, on the margins. Even when I was writing, whispering into my ear. Maybe I *was* in love with her. Maybe. Whispering, whispering, Norman with his two eyes closed, Norman squeezing my hand, his grip getting weaker and weaker until there is no grip—until there is no Norman, and I get up and pay for my latte and the unfinished Americano in the cup on the other side of the empty table.

“I guess he didn't show up,” says the barista.

“Yeah,” I say.

“His loss, I'm sure.”

“Thanks. It's probably not the last time I'll be stood up,” I say with a shrug, and I go home. I go home to write.",1,1770140526.0,deepnightsociety,1,1.0,False
1quylt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1quylt3/veronica_chapman/,Veronica Chapman,"We met on the subway. She commented on a book I was reading. She'd read it too, she said. That was rare. We exchanged contact information and kept in touch for a few weeks. Then we decided to have coffee together. Nothing fancy, a no pressure meet-up at a little waterfront cafe with good online reviews. I ordered an Americano. She ordered a cinnamon flavoured latte. “It's nice to see you again,” I said when she sat down. “Likewise,” she said. It was just after six o'clock on a Tuesday evening. Her name was Veronica Chapman.

She was sweet, confident without being arrogant, willing to listen as well as speak. She had brown eyes and light hair, which I note not because I fell in love with her but because I *don't* have brown eyes and light hair, and I need to remind myself that she and I are not the same person, even though it sometimes feels like we are, and Norman never did believe that we met by chance that afternoon on the subway, but that is how it happened, and how it happened led to our date in the coffee shop.

“What else do you read?” I asked.

“Oh, anything,” said Norman.

“Really?”

“Unless it was published after 1995. Then I wouldn't read it,” I said.

“So, not into contemporary lit,” said Veronica Chapman.

“Not really,” I said.

“Shame.”

“Why's that?” Norman asked.

“Because I'm a bit of a writer myself, and I was hoping you might like reading what I write,” I said. “I'm no Faulkner, but I'm not bad either.”

“Some people might say if you're not like Faulkner, that makes you good,” he said.

“Would you say that, Norman?” she asked.

“I wouldn't,” I said. “I like Faulkner.”

“Me too.”

I wanted to say: I write too; but I took a drink of coffee instead. It was good. The reviews didn't lie. I let the taste overcome my tongue before swallowing. “I write too,” I said. “Not for money or anything. Just for fun. What do you write—are you published?” I asked.

“Self-published,” she said.

“And I write stories. I post them online. Maybe it's silly. I had a Tumblr. Before that, a MySpace page.”

“I don't think it's silly. Not at all,” said Norman.

“Thanks,” I said.

She sipped her latte. “MySpace. Wow. You must have been writing for a while,” he added.

“Yeah.”

“What genre do you write in?”

“I've tried a few, but what I write doesn't usually fall into any one genre. It's kind of funny but also kind of horrific, sometimes absurd. Sometimes it's whatever I happen to be reading, like, by reading I'm eating an author's style—which I then regurgitate back onto the page.”

“I know what you mean. I do that too. It's like I'm a literary sponge.”

“What makes my writing mine is the setting: the world I set my stories in. Everything else is borrowed.”

“What's the setting?” I asked.

“A place called New Zork City,” said Veronica Chapman.

I nearly spat my Americano into her smiling face. I must have misheard.  “New *York* City?” I said.

“No, not New *York*. New *Zork*.” She must have seen my expression change: to one of shock—disbelief. “It's like New York but isn't New York. It's like a bizarro version of New York City. Not that I've ever been to New York City,” she said, to which I said: “I write New Zork City.”

“Pardon?”

“New *Zork* City—Zork: like the old text adventure game. *I* write stories set in New Zork City.”

“I write New Zork City.”

“Here. Look,” I said, pulling out my phone, opening my personal subreddit. “See? All these stories are set in New Zork. It's my world, not yours.”

“When did you write your first New Zork story?”

“Angles,” I said. “Two years ago.”

“Moises Maloney, acutization, the old man from Old New Zork, his exploding head, Thelma Baker, deadly nostalgia,” said Veronica Chapman.

“That's right,” I said.

“I wrote that one over a decade ago, and it wasn't even my first story.” She showed me her Tumblr. There it was: my story, *i.e.* her story, word-for-word the same but posted in 2014. I couldn't argue with a timestamp.

“That's impossible,” I said.

She said, “I wrote my first one in elementary school, a poem that referenced Rooklyn.”

And she showed that to me too. It was a photo of a handwritten piece of paper, the writing neat but obviously a child's,  predating my version of “Angles” by nearly a lifetime. “It's—” I started to say, to dispute: but dispute what? If the poem had been printed I could have argued it was a typo, automatic capitalisation, but it wasn't. “That could have been written at any time,” I said, and I pulled out an elementary school yearbook from the nineteen-nineties, in which the poem had been reproduced, and showed it to Norman Crane, who was speechless, his eyes darting from the yearbook to me, to the yearbook to—

“You came prepared,” he said in the tone of an accusation. “Nobody just walks around with a copy of their eighth grade yearbook. You sought me out. We didn't meet by coincidence. What is this? Who are you, and what the hell do you want from me?”

He was obviously distressed.

“No, it wasn't a coincidence,” I conceded. “I came across your stories online a few months ago and recognised them as my stories,” I told him. “Why are you ripping me off?”

“Me? I'm—I'm not ripping you off! My stories are my own: originals.”

“Yet they're clearly not,” said Veronica Chapman, and somewhere deep down I knew she was right. I mean: I wrote them, but they had come to me too easily, too fully formed. I had merely transcribed them.

“I'm not angry. I just want you to stop,” she said.

Then she bent forward and put one hand under the table we were sitting on opposite sides of.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“I have a gun,” she whispered, and I felt sweat start to run down the back of my neck, and I felt my hand hold the gun under the table pointed at Norman, and I felt having Veronica Chapman point the gun at me. “I know you have a good imagination,” she said. “Which means I know it doesn't matter whether I actually have a gun or not. You can imagine I do, and that's enough. In fact, you can't help but imagine it. You're probably trying to visualize what it looks like—the sound it would make if I pulled the trigger—how much it would hurt to get shot, how your body would be pushed back by the impact. You're imagining what the reactions would be: mine, everyone else's. You're imagining the blood, the wound, the beautiful warmth; pressing your hand against it, seeing yourself bleed out…”

“And all you want is for me to stop writing stories about New Zork City,” I said.

She was right: I couldn't stop imagining.

“Yes, that's all I want from you,” I said, keeping the imagined gun trained on Norman. “They're not your stories. Stop pretending they are.”

Norman squirmed.

“I don't know.”

“How many others have you found?”

“Three.”

“And how did—”

“They were persuadable.”

I didn't believe her. I didn't believe there were others. I didn't  believe her imagination was greater than mine. I didn't believe in her at all.

“Do you agree to stop writing New Zork City, Norman?” she asked.

“No,” I said.

“Then give me your hand,” she said, holding out the one she wasn't using to maybe-threaten me with a gun. “We'll have a battle of imaginations.”

“What?”

“We hold hands and try to imagine the world, each without the other.”

“Put away the gun,” I said.

“What gun?” Both her hands were on the table. She was finishing up her latte. I still had a third of my cooling Americano. “There is no gun.”

If I could imagine the Karma Police, a conquistador in Maninatinhat, a Voidberg, surely I can imagine a world without Veronica Chapman, I thought and took her hand in mine. Squeezing, we both closed our eyes. How romantic. How utterly, perversely romantic. But try as I might, I couldn't do it: I couldn't imagine Veronica Chapman out of existence. She was always there, on the margins. Even when I was writing, whispering into my ear. Maybe I *was* in love with her. Maybe. Whispering, whispering, Norman with his two eyes closed, Norman squeezing my hand, his grip getting weaker and weaker until there is no grip—until there is no Norman, and I get up and pay for my latte and the unfinished Americano in the cup on the other side of the empty table.

And I’m still so fucking tired. A lot of people say I need to cut down on caffeine but I didn’t get a boost from just a cup of coffee so I drank something else with more caffeine and nothing. And I’ve been working out more, not for the purpose of having more energy but I at least thought it’d help. I should probably just not drink caffeine anymore if it will do nothing, but I feel like it maybe gives a placebo effect energy boost at the very least. Maybe I need to take a tolerance break from caffeine but I’m working all week and I don’t want to be even more miserable. My friend said I should go to the doctor but what exactly could they do?

1quykz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1quykz1/veronica_chapman/,Veronica Chapman,"We met on the subway. She commented on a book I was reading. She'd read it too, she said. That was rare. We exchanged contact information and kept in touch for a few weeks. Then we decided to have coffee together. Nothing fancy, a no pressure meet-up at a little waterfront cafe with good online reviews. I ordered an Americano. She ordered a cinnamon flavoured latte. “It's nice to see you again,” I said when she sat down. “Likewise,” she said. It was just after six o'clock on a Tuesday evening. Her name was Veronica Chapman.

She was sweet, confident without being arrogant, willing to listen as well as speak. She had brown eyes and light hair, which I note not because I fell in love with her but because I *don't* have brown eyes and light hair, and I need to remind myself that she and I are not the same person, even though it sometimes feels like we are, and Norman never did believe that we met by chance that afternoon on the subway, but that is how it happened, and how it happened led to our date in the coffee shop.

“What else do you read?” I asked.

“Oh, anything,” said Norman.

“Really?”

“Unless it was published after 1995. Then I wouldn't read it,” I said.

“So, not into contemporary lit,” said Veronica Chapman.

“Not really,” I said.

“Shame.”

“Why's that?” Norman asked.

“Because I'm a bit of a writer myself, and I was hoping you might like reading what I write,” I said. “I'm no Faulkner, but I'm not bad either.”

“Some people might say if you're not like Faulkner, that makes you good,” he said.

“Would you say that, Norman?” she asked.

“I wouldn't,” I said. “I like Faulkner.”

“Me too.”

I wanted to say: I write too; but I took a drink of coffee instead. It was good. The reviews didn't lie. I let the taste overcome my tongue before swallowing. “I write too,” I said. “Not for money or anything. Just for fun. What do you write—are you published?” I asked.

“Self-published,” she said.

“And I write stories. I post them online. Maybe it's silly. I had a Tumblr. Before that, a MySpace page.”

“I don't think it's silly. Not at all,” said Norman.

“Thanks,” I said.

She sipped her latte. “MySpace. Wow. You must have been writing for a while,” he added.

“Yeah.”

“What genre do you write in?”

“I've tried a few, but what I write doesn't usually fall into any one genre. It's kind of funny but also kind of horrific, sometimes absurd. Sometimes it's whatever I happen to be reading, like, by reading I'm eating an author's style—which I then regurgitate back onto the page.”

“I know what you mean. I do that too. It's like I'm a literary sponge.”

“What makes my writing mine is the setting: the world I set my stories in. Everything else is borrowed.”

“What's the setting?” I asked.

“A place called New Zork City,” said Veronica Chapman.

I nearly spat my Americano into her smiling face. I must have misheard.  “New *York* City?” I said.

“No, not New *York*. New *Zork*.” She must have seen my expression change: to one of shock—disbelief. “It's like New York but isn't New York. It's like a bizarro version of New York City. Not that I've ever been to New York City,” she said, to which I said: “I write New Zork City.”

“Pardon?”

“New *Zork* City—Zork: like the old text adventure game. *I* write stories set in New Zork City.”

“I write New Zork City.”

“Here. Look,” I said, pulling out my phone, opening my personal subreddit. “See? All these stories are set in New Zork. It's my world, not yours.”

“When did you write your first New Zork story?”

“Angles,” I said. “Two years ago.”

“Moises Maloney, acutization, the old man from Old New Zork, his exploding head, Thelma Baker, deadly nostalgia,” said Veronica Chapman.

“That's right,” I said.

“I wrote that one over a decade ago, and it wasn't even my first story.” She showed me her Tumblr. There it was: my story, *i.e.* her story, word-for-word the same but posted in 2014. I couldn't argue with a timestamp.

“That's impossible,” I said.

She said, “I wrote my first one in elementary school, a poem that referenced Rooklyn.”

And she showed that to me too. It was a photo of a handwritten piece of paper, the writing neat but obviously a child's,  predating my version of “Angles” by nearly a lifetime. “It's—” I started to say, to dispute: but dispute what? If the poem had been printed I could have argued it was a typo, automatic capitalisation, but it wasn't. “That could have been written at any time,” I said, and I pulled out an elementary school yearbook from the nineteen-nineties, in which the poem had been reproduced, and showed it to Norman Crane, who was speechless, his eyes darting from the yearbook to me, to the yearbook to—

“You came prepared,” he said in the tone of an accusation. “Nobody just walks around with a copy of their eighth grade yearbook. You sought me out. We didn't meet by coincidence. What is this? Who are you, and what the hell do you want from me?”

He was obviously distressed.

“No, it wasn't a coincidence,” I conceded. “I came across your stories online a few months ago and recognised them as my stories,” I told him. “Why are you ripping me off?”

“Me? I'm—I'm not ripping you off! My stories are my own: originals.”

“Yet they're clearly not,” said Veronica Chapman, and somewhere deep down I knew she was right. I mean: I wrote them, but they had come to me too easily, too fully formed. I had merely transcribed them.

“I'm not angry. I just want you to stop,” she said.

Then she bent forward and put one hand under the table we were sitting on opposite sides of.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“I have a gun,” she whispered, and I felt sweat start to run down the back of my neck, and I felt my hand hold the gun under the table pointed at Norman, and I felt having Veronica Chapman point the gun at me. “I know you have a good imagination,” she said. “Which means I know it doesn't matter whether I actually have a gun or not. You can imagine I do, and that's enough. In fact, you can't help but imagine it. You're probably trying to visualize what it looks like—the sound it would make if I pulled the trigger—how much it would hurt to get shot, how your body would be pushed back by the impact. You're imagining what the reactions would be: mine, everyone else's. You're imagining the blood, the wound, the beautiful warmth; pressing your hand against it, seeing yourself bleed out…”

“And all you want is for me to stop writing stories about New Zork City,” I said.

She was right: I couldn't stop imagining.

“Yes, that's all I want from you,” I said, keeping the imagined gun trained on Norman. “They're not your stories. Stop pretending they are.”

Norman squirmed.

To everybody else in the coffee place we were just two people on a date.

“Finish your Americano, forget New Zork and go on with the rest of your life. Imagine this never happened,” I said. “That's safest for both of us.”

“Even if you did write the stories first—”

“I did,” she said.

“Fine. You wrote them first. But how do you know nobody wrote them before you did? Maybe your claim to them is no better than mine.”

Veronica Chapman laughed. “It's not just about who's first, Norman. It's about power: the power of imagination. I bet, until now, you've never met anyone who could imagine the way you can. That's fair. You're not bad, Norman. You're not bad at all—but you're not the best, and New Zork City belongs to the best.”

All I could do was watch her.

“What's the source?” I asked finally, imagining her as a girl standing over my dead body, sitting down, putting a notebook filled with lined sheets of paper on my chest and writing her poem about Rooklyn. “Where does it all come from? To me, to you…”

We’re hoping to get honest, real-world insight from people who actually live there — both the good *and* the not-so-good.

**What we’re looking for:**

* A small town or small city feel (not a big metro)
* Strong access to nature (mountains, trails, water, open land)
* A few good local coffee shops and third-place vibes
* Tattoo-friendly culture (we’re not in the industry, just part of the culture)
* Thrift/vintage stores and a creative or artsy community
* Some access to natural or organic food options (co-ops, markets, etc.)
* Overall slower pace and good quality of life

**Things we’re especially curious about:**

* Housing reality (rent availability, competition, seasonal pressure)
* Day-to-day cost of living vs wages
* Community vibe (welcoming? transient? tourist-heavy?)
* Anything people tend to romanticize — and later regret

We know every place has tradeoffs, and we’re not looking for “perfect,” just a place that feels livable and aligned long-term.

1quyk7x,https://v.redd.it/c2xxp387gbhg1,Bad beans? Bad Barista (me)? [GCP & Sette 270],"I have a gaggia classic pro and a sette 270, which has been my only set up for about 5 years, only had minor issues with over pressure from gcp, which I remediate by running the machine before it's fully warmed up. I recently went to a coffee shop and picked up some very expensive beans, but my shots are flying out like water. I moved the Sette 270 from A3 (most beans like A3-4 range) to the A1 setting (the finest possible, chokes the machine out with all other beans) and have been running it everywhere from cold to fully warmed up. I started with a 17.5g dose up to 19g, same result every time. The tag on the beans say roasted 1/19 - so 15 days ago.

I'm now through about 60% of my $35 for 10oz beans without a successful pull :(. Any thoughts?

My only reasonable explanation is the beans weren't sealed properly and have aired out too much? Or is there such thing as beans too nice for my mid set up?

He is not at all who he was, he used to be so kind to everyone but now he’s just so mean and the dementia makes everything so hard. In a difficult situation because his wife wants him home but she cannot take care of him, let alone herself most days (non-memory related) so my husband, toddler and myself (currently pregnant and high risk) moved in 7 months ago to take care of them. 

This is too much and she is refusing to let any professionals help. No in-home care, no hospitals, no doctors, no memory units or anything else. Last night he was wandering until 6:30 in the morning. We all love him but it has long since passed the point of us speculating when this will all finally be over because we are crumbling. No idea what stage he is, we can’t even get a proper diagnosis due to the situation. 

He refuses to shower or let anyone help bathe him. The last time he touched water was over 2 months ago now. He’s been refusing pills and pretending to take them then just hiding them in random locations which has not been fun with a toddler, and he won’t eat more than 1 meal a day. I can’t even get him to drink water, he will only drink coffee and milk. Our plan now is to try to save up and recover from the money we have spent helping while staying here to afford a place to live since we gave up our old home and then force help upon them by calling adult protective services. 

I don’t really know what else we can do. I’m pretty sure he is late stage 6, he’s 85 and very unsteady - has frequent falls and I’m worried due to the lack of any hygiene he will soon develop an infection of some sort if he doesn’t have one already.

I’m a 30-year-old guy from currently living in Orillia Ontario, Canada. I’m pretty introverted and reflective, and I’ve realized that dating apps and forcing things just haven’t worked for me. I’m here hoping for something slower and more genuine.

A bit about me:
I work full-time in healthcare. I’m into video games (recently finished Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, but I play a lot more, just ask), movies, and music (my Spotify playlists are the bomb; let’s make a Blend). I enjoy good food and coffee/bubble tea, long walks, and low-key hangouts. I’m not loud or flashy, but I’m a good listener and will happily listen to you yap lol, and I care deeply once I connect with someone.
Dating hasn’t been easy for me, but I’m trying to be more intentional and open instead of giving up. I’m not looking to rush anything or play games. I just want a real connection with someone who values kindness, patience, and authenticity.
If you’re also introverted, thoughtful, or just tired of shallow dating, I’d really like to hear from you. Even a genuine conversation would be nice.

I need low carb for my drinks, but love yummy sweeter tasting drinks and get tired of black coffee with a splash of HWC. This is my current favorite, but has a lot of half and half (high fat and calories) so it's a treat even with SF syrup. What are your faves and what do I ask for? I'd also love tips on how to make some of the menu drinks lesser carb and still taste good.

1quygrz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1quygrz,Mould on moss in terrarium - HELP 😩🌿,"We went to a terrarium making class and they made it seem like the terrariums we left with would be balanced and healthy, but instead it's been a constant battle against mould. At first they just advised us to open the terrarium for 24 hours and reclose, and to repeat until the water level was balanced and no more droplets were consistently on the sides. And that when a plant went black or grew mould, to cut those bits off. 


However in reality we had to open the terrarium for 24 hours (and later for 48) about 10 times over a couple of months, and just recently for the last 3-4 weeks my terrarium seemed to have stabilised. It even had some new growth of small leaves on my coffee plant (although a different plant is going brown). 


Today however, I noticed that my green moss (around the back, although it was actually facing the sun) is covered in a layer of fluffy white mould all over. I don't know if it is still too damp (which seems strange because it is so pale now from lack of moisture) or if it is mouldy precisely because it is too dry (but then if I add more water surely the rest of the plants will become mouldy again). 


I would have abandoned the terrarium a while ago if the class hadn't been such a thoughtful gift (and I loved the terrarium before it became such a problem child).

The thing about being a good person is that it’ll get you killed.

I should’ve known better. Should’ve driven past the woman on the side of Route 47 like every other sensible human being would’ve done at eleven o’clock on a Friday night. But no—Dean Morrison, certified good guy and grade-A idiot, had to pull over his beat-up Civic because some stranger \*might\* need help.

My mom would’ve been proud. Right up until the part where I got shot.

It had been a good night, too. Marcus’s place, pizza, beer, and a Knicks game that actually didn’t make me want to put my fist through his TV. We’d been friends since high school—he’d gone into IT, I’d gone into turning wrenches, but we still made time for the important things. Like arguing about whether the Knicks would ever stop being a complete dumpster fire (they wouldn’t) and whether Marcus’s new girlfriend was actually into him or just his newly renovated basement man-cave (jury was still out).

“I’m telling you, Dean, she laughed at my joke about subnet masks,” Marcus had said, gesturing with a slice of pepperoni like it proved something. “Marcus, my man, nobody laughs at subnet mask jokes. She was being polite.” “You’re just jealous because you haven’t been on a date in six months.”

“Eight months, thank you very much. And I’m not jealous, I’m realistic. Women don’t laugh at IT jokes unless they’re planning to use you for your HBO password.”

He’d thrown a wadded-up napkin at me. I’d dodged it, grinning. It was a good night. Simple. The kind of night where the biggest problem was whether to order wings or mozzarella sticks (we got both, because we’re adults and can make our own choices).

I was maybe two beers in—enough to be relaxed, not enough to be stupid. Or so I thought. My tolerance was pretty decent after years of post-work beers with the guys from the shop. Tony always said I had the metabolism of a hummingbird on cocaine, which was his colorful way of saying I burned through alcohol faster than most people.

I’d left around ten-thirty, waving off Marcus’s offer to let me crash on his couch. “I’m fine, dude. It’s a forty-minute drive and I’m barely buzzed.”

“Text me when you get home.”

“Yes, mom.”

“I’m serious, Dean. You know how weird people get out on 47 at night.”

I did know. Route 47 was the kind of road that featured prominently in local ghost stories and true crime podcasts. Long stretches of nothing, barely any cell service, the occasional farm house set so far back from the road you couldn’t see it. The kind of place where people disappeared and didn’t get found until deer season.

But it was also the fastest way home, and I’d driven it a hundred times without incident.

Until tonight.

The woman was standing next to a silver sedan with its hazards on, waving her arms in that universal gesture of “my life is falling apart, please help.” She looked harmless enough—mid-thirties, business casual, the kind of person who probably had a Costco membership and strong opinions about school boards. Her sedan was one of those practical family cars, a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry, the automotive equivalent of beige.

I checked my mirrors. Empty road, nothing but corn fields and darkness in every direction. The nearest town was twenty minutes back. The nearest house could be anywhere from a mile to five miles away, hidden behind the rows of dead corn stalks waiting for harvest.

I sighed, already knowing I was going to regret this, and pulled onto the shoulder about thirty feet behind her car.

My conscience was both my best and worst feature. It’s what made me good at my job—I couldn’t leave a car half-fixed, couldn’t cut corners even when the customer would never know the difference. It’s also what made me stop for strangers on dark roads when every true crime documentary I’d ever half-watched while falling asleep told me not to.

The gravel crunched under my boots as I got out. October in upstate New York meant the night had teeth—cold enough to see my breath, not quite cold enough to justify the heavy coat I’d left at home because I was an optimist and an idiot. I pulled my phone out, turned on the flashlight. Forty-two percent battery. Good enough.

“Hey!” I called out. “You okay? Need me to call someone?”

She turned toward me, relief flooding her face. It looked genuine. That was the thing that would bother me later, assuming I had a later—how genuine she looked. Like she actually needed help. Like she wasn’t the bait in a trap.

“Oh thank God,” she said, and even her voice sold it. Shaky, stressed, grateful. “My tire—I think I ran over something. I don’t know how to change it and my phone’s dead and I’ve been out here for twenty minutes and nobody’s stopped.”

I felt a little guilty about that last part, like somehow other people’s callousness was my responsibility to make up for.

“No problem,” I said, walking closer. I kept the phone light pointed down so I wouldn’t blind her. “I’m a mechanic, actually. Changing tires is like, day-one stuff. You got a spare in the trunk?”

“I think so? I’m not really car-savvy.” She laughed, nervous and self-deprecating. “My husband usually handles this stuff but he’s out of town and—”

That’s when they came out of the corn.

Three of them, maybe four—it happened so fast I couldn’t get an accurate count. They moved like they’d done this before, fanning out to cut off any escape route back to my car. Big guys, all of them. Ski masks. Dark clothes. One had a crowbar. The woman’s expression shifted from grateful to something harder, colder. Professional.

I’d been played. Completely, utterly played.

“Wallet and phone,” one of them said. Big guy, ski mask, voice like he gargled gravel for breakfast. The crowbar guy, because of course he was. “Now.”

My heart was doing its best impression of a jackhammer, but I kept my hands visible, non-threatening. I’d grown up in Queens before my family moved upstate when I was twelve. I knew the script. Give them what they want, go home alive, file a police report that goes nowhere, call your bank to cancel your cards, and chalk it up to the universe reminding you that no good deed goes unpunished.

“Okay,” I said, keeping my voice steady. My dad always said that panic was contagious but so was calm. If you acted like you had control, sometimes people believed it. Even when you absolutely didn’t. “Okay, no problem. Wallet’s in my back pocket—”

“Hurry up!” That was a different voice, younger, jumpier. Great. Jumpy was bad. Jumpy meant trigger-happy.

I reached back slowly, fingers finding the worn leather. The wallet had been a gift from my mom three Christmases ago, already getting soft at the corners. Had maybe sixty bucks in it, a couple credit cards, my license with a photo that made me look like a mugshot reject, and a punch card for the coffee place near the shop that was two stamps away from a free medium.

I pulled it out, tossed it to the gravel between us. My phone followed—there went eight months of photos, text threads, and a truly embarrassing amount of time spent on Reddit at three in the morning when I couldn’t sleep.

“Smart,” Gravel Voice said. He sounded almost approving, like I was a dog that had learned a new trick. “Now the keys.”

That’s where the script changed. The car keys were still in the ignition , and something about the way he said it—too eager, too specific—made my stomach drop.

They weren’t just robbing me. They were taking my car. And if they took my car, I was stranded out here in the middle of nowhere with no phone, no wallet, and a twenty-mile walk to the nearest gas station that might not even be open at this hour.

Best case scenario: I walked until someone stopped. Hoped they were actually good Samaritans and not opportunists round two.

Worst case scenario: I didn’t make it to morning. Exposure, wildlife, or just the kind of bad luck that seemed to be following me tonight.

But there was something else. Something in the way the woman had already stepped back, already dismissing me. Something in how one of the others moved to flank me, hand going to his waistband. I caught a glimpse of metal.

They weren’t just taking my car. They were making sure there were no witnesses.

Turns out there was an even worse scenario that I was now only realising. They needed me for nothing. I was a loose end. Loose ends get tied up.

I saw it in the woman’s face, the casual cruelty of someone who’d done this before and would do it again. Saw it in the way Gravel Voice positioned himself, blocking any escape route.

You know that feeling right before you do something monumentally stupid? That little voice that says “don’t, you idiot, you’re a mechanic not an action hero, you go to the gym four times a week but that doesn’t make you Jason Bourne”? I heard it. I really did.

Then I thought about being another true crime podcast episode. “Local Mechanic Found Dead on Route 47.” I thought about my mom getting that phone call. I thought about Marcus waiting for a text that would never come.

And the voice got a lot quieter.

When Gravel Voice stepped forward to grab my wallet, I moved. Grabbed his wrist, twisted like the self-defense instructor had shown us—“small joint manipulation, use their momentum against them”—and drove my knee up into what I hoped was somewhere painful. The self-defense class I’d taken three years ago at the community center came in surprisingly handy. Loud noises. Go for soft targets. Run if you can.

I couldn’t run. Not yet.

Gravel Voice made a sound like a deflating balloon. Someone grabbed me from behind, arms wrapping around my chest in a bear hug that squeezed the air from my lungs. I threw my head back, felt it connect with something that crunched—nose, probably. The arms loosened. I spun, got one good hit into someone’s gut before the world exploded into pain.

The gunshot was impossibly loud, echoing across the empty fields like the universe itself had cracked open. I didn’t even realize I’d been hit at first—just felt like someone had punched me in the side, hard enough to knock the air from my lungs. Like that time in high school when I’d taken an elbow to the ribs during basketball and couldn’t breathe right for a week.

Then the pain came, sharp and hot and spreading like spilled gasoline, and I understood with perfect clarity that I’d been shot. Actually shot. With an actual bullet. This wasn’t a movie. This was real. This was happening.

I staggered back. One of them was on the ground, clutching his face—the head-butt guy, probably dealing with a broken nose. Another was raising the gun again, arm extended, and I could see down the barrel. Could see my death coming.

I ran.

Didn’t think about it, didn’t plan it, just turned and ran toward my car. Every step sent lightning through my side. I could feel something warm soaking through my shirt, spreading across my jeans. My keys were still in the ignition—thank God for small mercies and bad habits and my constant failure to follow basic safety protocols.

My hand found the door handle. Yanked it open. Fell into the driver’s seat.

Tires squealed. Someone shouted. Another gunshot cracked the night but hit nothing but air and possibly my rear windshield—I heard glass shatter but didn’t stop to check. I slammed the gas and the Civic lurched forward, gravel spraying, rear end fishtailing before the tires found purchase on the asphalt.

In the mirror, I saw them scrambling. Saw the woman on her phone, probably calling whoever was supposed to show up in my car. Saw Gravel Voice stumbling to his feet.

Then they disappeared around a bend and there was just darkness and corn fields and the absolutely wild realization that I’d been shot.

“Okay,” I said out loud, because apparently I talk to myself when bleeding out. My voice sounded strange, distant. “Okay, this is fine. This is totally fine. People get shot all the time. It’s fine.”

It was not fine.

My side felt like someone was holding a blowtorch to it. Every breath was a knife. The steering wheel was slick—I looked down and realized my hand was covered in blood. My blood. Too much blood. Way too much blood. The driver’s seat was getting wet. I was making a mess of my car and somehow that bothered me almost as much as the dying part.

I needed a hospital. I needed to call 911. I needed—

My phone. I’d thrown my phone to those bastards.

“Perfect,” I gasped. “Perfect. Great choices, Dean. Really stellar decision-making tonight. Top-tier survival instincts.”

The road stretched ahead, empty and dark. The Civic’s headlights cut through the night like knives, illuminating nothing but asphalt and painted lines and the occasional reflective road sign. I had maybe a quarter tank of gas. No phone. No idea exactly where I was—somewhere off Route 47, but I’d taken a couple turns leaving Marcus’s place and everything looked the same in the dark. Trees. Corn. More trees. More corn.

The smart thing would be to stay on the main road, flag down another car, get help.

The problem was I could feel myself getting weaker. My vision kept blurring at the edges, tunneling down to a pinpoint before snapping back. The wheel was getting harder to hold steady. My hands were shaking. When had they started shaking?

I wasn’t going to make it to another car. I wasn’t even sure I was going to make it another five minutes.

That’s when I saw the dirt road.

It was barely visible, just a gap in the tree line with what might’ve been tire tracks leading into darkness. Usually I wouldn’t have given it a second look—probably led to someone’s farmhouse or a hunting cabin or a meth lab or, knowing my luck tonight, a secondary ambush location where they finished what they started.

But through the trees, maybe a quarter mile in, I could see lights.

Lights meant people. People meant phones. Phones meant ambulances. Ambulances meant I might actually survive this cosmically unfair night.

I yanked the wheel right, hard enough that the Civic protested with a sound like a wounded animal, and bumped onto the dirt track. The suspension screamed as we hit every pothole and rock. Each jolt sent fresh agony through my side. I could taste copper. Was I bleeding internally too? That seemed bad. That seemed very bad.

The lights got closer. Brighter. They had a strange quality, cold and clean, not like regular house lights.

And then the trees parted and I saw it.

“What the hell?”

It was a house. Calling it a mansion seemed insufficient—this thing looked like it had been airlifted from some architectural magazine and dropped in the middle of nowhere New York. Ultra-modern, all clean lines and enormous windows, glowing like a spaceship against the dark sky. Three stories of steel and glass and angles that shouldn’t work but somehow did. It looked like money. Serious money. The kind of money that had accountants and lawyers and probably an interior designer whose consultation fee was more than my annual salary.

What was it doing here? On a dirt road? In the middle of nowhere?

I didn’t care. I really, really didn’t care.

I pulled up to what I assumed was the front—there was a massive door, at least, more art installation than entry point—and killed the engine. Opened the door. Tried to stand.

My legs had other ideas.

I half-fell out of the car, catching myself on the door frame. The world tilted sideways, the ground rushing up before settling back into place. I pressed my hand to my side and it came away dark and wet, almost black in the strange lighting.

“Not good,” I muttered. “Definitely not good. Very not good.”

The door was maybe twenty feet away. Might as well have been twenty miles.

I stumbled forward, legs made of rubber, vision tunneling. One step. Two. Three. Don’t fall. Don’t fall. If you fall you’re not getting back up.

The door was right there. I reached out, expecting to knock, to call for help, to collapse on someone’s designer doorstep and hope they called an ambulance before calling the police.

It swung open at my touch.

Just… opened. Like it had been waiting for me.

“Hello?” My voice came out barely above a whisper. “I need—I need help. I’ve been—”

Shot. I’ve been shot. That was the word I needed. But my tongue felt too thick, my thoughts too slow, everything moving through molasses.

I staggered inside because falling forward was easier than falling backward, and if I was going to die I’d rather do it inside where it was warm.

The interior was just as impossible as the exterior—soaring ceilings that disappeared into shadow, minimalist furniture that easily cost more than my car, lighting that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. It looked like money. The kind of money that didn’t end up on dirt roads. The kind of money that had secrets.

“Hello?” I tried again. “Please—”

That’s when I realized two things simultaneously.

First: the house was completely silent. Not empty-silent, but waiting-silent. The kind of quiet that presses against your eardrums and makes you aware of your own heartbeat, your own breathing, the wet sound your boots make on expensive flooring when they’re soaked with blood.

Second: I was dying.

The floor was coming up to meet me. I didn’t have the strength to stop it. My knees hit first, then my hands, and then I was on the ground, vision graying at the edges, that strange tunnel vision closing in tighter and tighter.

Footsteps. Multiple sets, moving with an odd synchronicity. Too synchronized. Moving too quietly for their number.

I managed to lift my head.

Five women stood in a semicircle around me.

Beautiful didn’t cover it. They looked like they’d stepped out of different centuries, different worlds, but all shared an otherworldly quality that made my concussed, blood-deprived brain struggle to process them. One had hair so black it seemed to absorb light, severe features, the kind of face that could launch wars or end them. Another was ethereal, silver-blonde, delicate as porcelain. A third had copper-red hair and green eyes that caught the light like a cat’s. The fourth was softer, warm brown eyes that seemed almost human, almost kind. The fifth was petite, dark-haired, intense, staring at me like I was a puzzle she needed to solve.

They were all watching me. Not with concern. With… curiosity. Like I was an interesting specimen. A bug under glass.

Behind them, a man. Tall, dark-haired, wearing an impeccably tailored suit that was as dark and the spaces between stars . His face was all sharp angles and aristocratic features, ageless in a way that made no sense, and when he looked at me, his eyes were ancient. Old. Too old.

“Well,” he said, voice smooth as expensive whiskey. European accent, maybe? Hard to place. “This is unexpected.”

One of the women—the silver-blonde, ethereal one—tilted her head. “He’s dying.”

“I can see that, Seraphina.”

Another woman, the one with copper-red hair, crouched down to my level. She inhaled deeply, and something about the gesture made my skin crawl. It was too deliberate. Too purposeful. Like she was savoring something.

“He smells… interesting,” she said, and smiled. Her teeth were very white.

“Isla, don’t be crass.” That was the severe one, dark-haired and commanding. She looked at me like I was a stain on her expensive floor. Probably was, actually. I was definitely bleeding on her floor. “What do we do with him?”

“We could—” the intense one started.

“No, Vivienne.”

The man—and some distant part of my brain was screaming that I should know who he was, what he was, what all of them were—stepped forward. His shoes were expensive. Italian, maybe. They stopped right in front of my face.

“The question,” he said, “is not what we do with him. The question is whether he wishes to live.”

I tried to answer. Tried to say yes, obviously yes, I didn’t survive getting shot and drive half-dead through the woods just to bleed out in a stranger’s foyer, I wanted to live, I very badly wanted to live.

What came out was: “Please.”

He smiled. It wasn’t a comforting expression.

“Then, my dear boy,” he said, kneeling down to look me in the eye, “let’s discuss your employment options.”

Then I thought about being another true crime podcast episode. “Local Mechanic Found Dead on Route 47.” I thought about my mom getting that phone call. I thought about Marcus waiting for a text that would never come.

And the voice got a lot quieter.

When Gravel Voice stepped forward to grab my wallet, I moved. Grabbed his wrist, twisted like the self-defense instructor had shown us—“small joint manipulation, use their momentum against them”—and drove my knee up into what I hoped was somewhere painful. The self-defense class I’d taken three years ago at the community center came in surprisingly handy. Loud noises. Go for soft targets. Run if you can.

I couldn’t run. Not yet.

Gravel Voice made a sound like a deflating balloon. Someone grabbed me from behind, arms wrapping around my chest in a bear hug that squeezed the air from my lungs. I threw my head back, felt it connect with something that crunched—nose, probably. The arms loosened. I spun, got one good hit into someone’s gut before the world exploded into pain.

The gunshot was impossibly loud, echoing across the empty fields like the universe itself had cracked open. I didn’t even realize I’d been hit at first—just felt like someone had punched me in the side, hard enough to knock the air from my lungs. Like that time in high school when I’d taken an elbow to the ribs during basketball and couldn’t breathe right for a week.

Then the pain came, sharp and hot and spreading like spilled gasoline, and I understood with perfect clarity that I’d been shot. Actually shot. With an actual bullet. This wasn’t a movie. This was real. This was happening.

I staggered back. One of them was on the ground, clutching his face—the head-butt guy, probably dealing with a broken nose. Another was raising the gun again, arm extended, and I could see down the barrel. Could see my death coming.

I ran.

Didn’t think about it, didn’t plan it, just turned and ran toward my car. Every step sent lightning through my side. I could feel something warm soaking through my shirt, spreading across my jeans. My keys were still in the ignition—thank God for small mercies and bad habits and my constant failure to follow basic safety protocols.

My hand found the door handle. Yanked it open. Fell into the driver’s seat.

Tires squealed. Someone shouted. Another gunshot cracked the night but hit nothing but air and possibly my rear windshield—I heard glass shatter but didn’t stop to check. I slammed the gas and the Civic lurched forward, gravel spraying, rear end fishtailing before the tires found purchase on the asphalt.

In the mirror, I saw them scrambling. Saw the woman on her phone, probably calling whoever was supposed to show up in my car. Saw Gravel Voice stumbling to his feet.

Then they disappeared around a bend and there was just darkness and corn fields and the absolutely wild realization that I’d been shot.

“Okay,” I said out loud, because apparently I talk to myself when bleeding out. My voice sounded strange, distant. “Okay, this is fine. This is totally fine. People get shot all the time. It’s fine.”

It was not fine.

My side felt like someone was holding a blowtorch to it. Every breath was a knife. The steering wheel was slick—I looked down and realized my hand was covered in blood. My blood. Too much blood. Way too much blood. The driver’s seat was getting wet. I was making a mess of my car and somehow that bothered me almost as much as the dying part.

I needed a hospital. I needed to call 911. I needed—

My phone. I’d thrown my phone to those bastards.

“Perfect,” I gasped. “Perfect. Great choices, Dean. Really stellar decision-making tonight. Top-tier survival instincts.”

The road stretched ahead, empty and dark. The Civic’s headlights cut through the night like knives, illuminating nothing but asphalt and painted lines and the occasional reflective road sign. I had maybe a quarter tank of gas. No phone. No idea exactly where I was—somewhere off Route 47, but I’d taken a couple turns leaving Marcus’s place and everything looked the same in the dark. Trees. Corn. More trees. More corn.

The smart thing would be to stay on the main road, flag down another car, get help.

The problem was I could feel myself getting weaker. My vision kept blurring at the edges, tunneling down to a pinpoint before snapping back. The wheel was getting harder to hold steady. My hands were shaking. When had they started shaking?

I wasn’t going to make it to another car. I wasn’t even sure I was going to make it another five minutes.

That’s when I saw the dirt road.

It was barely visible, just a gap in the tree line with what might’ve been tire tracks leading into darkness. Usually I wouldn’t have given it a second look—probably led to someone’s farmhouse or a hunting cabin or a meth lab or, knowing my luck tonight, a secondary ambush location where they finished what they started.

But through the trees, maybe a quarter mile in, I could see lights.

Lights meant people. People meant phones. Phones meant ambulances. Ambulances meant I might actually survive this cosmically unfair night.

I yanked the wheel right, hard enough that the Civic protested with a sound like a wounded animal, and bumped onto the dirt track. The suspension screamed as we hit every pothole and rock. Each jolt sent fresh agony through my side. I could taste copper. Was I bleeding internally too? That seemed bad. That seemed very bad.

The lights got closer. Brighter. They had a strange quality, cold and clean, not like regular house lights.

And then the trees parted and I saw it.

“What the hell?”

It was a house. Calling it a mansion seemed insufficient—this thing looked like it had been airlifted from some architectural magazine and dropped in the middle of nowhere New York. Ultra-modern, all clean lines and enormous windows, glowing like a spaceship against the dark sky. Three stories of steel and glass and angles that shouldn’t work but somehow did. It looked like money. Serious money. The kind of money that had accountants and lawyers and probably an interior designer whose consultation fee was more than my annual salary.

What was it doing here? On a dirt road? In the middle of nowhere?

I didn’t care. I really, really didn’t care.

I pulled up to what I assumed was the front—there was a massive door, at least, more art installation than entry point—and killed the engine. Opened the door. Tried to stand.

My legs had other ideas.

I half-fell out of the car, catching myself on the door frame. The world tilted sideways, the ground rushing up before settling back into place. I pressed my hand to my side and it came away dark and wet, almost black in the strange lighting.

“Not good,” I muttered. “Definitely not good. Very not good.”

The door was maybe twenty feet away. Might as well have been twenty miles.

I stumbled forward, legs made of rubber, vision tunneling. One step. Two. Three. Don’t fall. Don’t fall. If you fall you’re not getting back up.

The door was right there. I reached out, expecting to knock, to call for help, to collapse on someone’s designer doorstep and hope they called an ambulance before calling the police.

It swung open at my touch.

Just… opened. Like it had been waiting for me.

“Hello?” My voice came out barely above a whisper. “I need—I need help. I’ve been—”

Shot. I’ve been shot. That was the word I needed. But my tongue felt too thick, my thoughts too slow, everything moving through molasses.

I staggered inside because falling forward was easier than falling backward, and if I was going to die I’d rather do it inside where it was warm.

The interior was just as impossible as the exterior—soaring ceilings that disappeared into shadow, minimalist furniture that easily cost more than my car, lighting that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. It looked like money. The kind of money that didn’t end up on dirt roads. The kind of money that had secrets.

“Hello?” I tried again. “Please—”

That’s when I realized two things simultaneously.

First: the house was completely silent. Not empty-silent, but waiting-silent. The kind of quiet that presses against your eardrums and makes you aware of your own heartbeat, your own breathing, the wet sound your boots make on expensive flooring when they’re soaked with blood.

Second: I was dying.

The floor was coming up to meet me. I didn’t have the strength to stop it. My knees hit first, then my hands, and then I was on the ground, vision graying at the edges, that strange tunnel vision closing in tighter and tighter.

Footsteps. Multiple sets, moving with an odd synchronicity. Too synchronized. Moving too quietly for their number.

I managed to lift my head.

Five women stood in a semicircle around me.

Beautiful didn’t cover it. They looked like they’d stepped out of different centuries, different worlds, but all shared an otherworldly quality that made my concussed, blood-deprived brain struggle to process them. One had hair so black it seemed to absorb light, severe features, the kind of face that could launch wars or end them. Another was ethereal, silver-blonde, delicate as porcelain. A third had copper-red hair and green eyes that caught the light like a cat’s. The fourth was softer, warm brown eyes that seemed almost human, almost kind. The fifth was petite, dark-haired, intense, staring at me like I was a puzzle she needed to solve.

They were all watching me. Not with concern. With… curiosity. Like I was an interesting specimen. A bug under glass.

Behind them, a man. Tall, dark-haired, wearing an impeccably tailored suit that was as dark and the spaces between stars . His face was all sharp angles and aristocratic features, ageless in a way that made no sense, and when he looked at me, his eyes were ancient. Old. Too old.

“Well,” he said, voice smooth as expensive whiskey. European accent, maybe? Hard to place. “This is unexpected.”

One of the women—the silver-blonde, ethereal one—tilted her head. “He’s dying.”

“I can see that, Seraphina.”

Another woman, the one with copper-red hair, crouched down to my level. She inhaled deeply, and something about the gesture made my skin crawl. It was too deliberate. Too purposeful. Like she was savoring something.

“He smells… interesting,” she said, and smiled. Her teeth were very white.

“Isla, don’t be crass.” That was the severe one, dark-haired and commanding. She looked at me like I was a stain on her expensive floor. Probably was, actually. I was definitely bleeding on her floor. “What do we do with him?”

“We could—” the intense one started.

“No, Vivienne.”

The man—and some distant part of my brain was screaming that I should know who he was, what he was, what all of them were—stepped forward. His shoes were expensive. Italian, maybe. They stopped right in front of my face.

“The question,” he said, “is not what we do with him. The question is whether he wishes to live.”

I tried to answer. Tried to say yes, obviously yes, I didn’t survive getting shot and drive half-dead through the woods just to bleed out in a stranger’s foyer, I wanted to live, I very badly wanted to live.

What came out was: “Please.”

He smiled. It wasn’t a comforting expression.

“Then, my dear boy,” he said, kneeling down to look me in the eye, “let’s discuss your employment options.”

1quyawt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CritiqueIslam/comments/1quyawt/so_if_islam_says_its_abrahamic_praises_jewish/,"So, if Islam says it’s Abrahamic, praises Jewish prophethood, sanctions killing, and yet Muhammad wasn’t Jewish while Jesus never killed anyone… am I supposed to believe this all fits together, or did I miss the part where reality takes a coffee break?","Islam functions fundamentally as a political movement, rather than as a genuine path guiding its followers to paradise. Throughout history, it has often used religion as a tool to advance political agendas worldwide. If it were truly divinely blessed, then whatever it influenced would flourish—but that is clearly not the case. 

In reality, anything Islam dominates frequently stagnates or declines. This pattern is evident in many Muslim-majority countries, where chaos and dysfunction persist and often intensify.

Hamas, for example, operates as a political organization acting as the “right hand of Allah,” similar to how Muhammad commanded his own military in the 7th century. 

Islam claims, without substantive evidence, to belong to the same Abrahamic tradition as Jesus Christ. Yet unlike Muhammad, Jesus and his disciples never killed anyone; instead, they were all executed for their beliefs—people don’t know this, but all of Jesus’ disciples were killed except John, who was reportedly thrown into boiling oil and emerged unharmed. In contrast, Islam has historically sanctioned killing in the name of its beliefs and continued to do so. 

So, how can Islam claim to be an Abrahamic religion while explicitly asserting that prophethood was given to the Jews, knowing that Muhammad himself was not a Jew?",3,1770139850.0,CritiqueIslam,1,1.0,False

However, I missed the ritual and focus that a cup of coffee provides.

What I wanted was something as similar to regular coffee as possible, but without the caffeine, crashes, or anxiety.

The obvious choice was decaf, but I tried a bunch of different options and I found that they all lacked a depth of flavour, which I'm told is because of how it's processed.

After hours of research I landed on the following:

- Decaf coffee.

- Chicory root: adds depth and balances out the acidity of decaf.

- L-theanine: I find it helpful for a relaxed boost and as it's flavourless it doesn't affect the coffee taste.

There's other things I've considered adding but want to avoid supplement stacking.

I've been drinking it for over a year now and it's better than any of the alternatives I've tried.

But the big question: if this existed as a ready-made, instant drink that you just had to add hot water and milk/sugar, would it be something you’d actually buy?

It'd likely work out at around £0.22 per serving.

She was a pretty demanding newborn (always wanting to be held, only contant naps and cosleeping ever, colic and PURPLE crying all through month 2, hated the carrier, hated the stroller, hated being outside in general, and lots more) which made the trenches pretty brutal in and of themselves. Now at month 4 I feel like I'm basically running on fumes. 

Her night-time sleep is fine most of the time, but the moment she opens her eyes in the morning it's GO. She fusses 90% of the time she is awake. I take her out on walks around the neighbourhood every morning, which is fine most of the time as long as they're short. I've tried to take her to the park or a coffee shop, but she always starts screaming crying and refusing to be consoled so I have to rush back home. Nursing her used to be the time when I could catch my breath, maybe read a few pages on my kindle or watch some TV. Now she fusses the entire time she's on the breast, pulls at my nipples, scratches and tugs at my boob which is so painful and just infuriates me. I have to hold her hands hostage or put mittens on her which I don't always remember to do before I start nursing (and stopping to grab them may result in more fussing and crying). She gets very easily bored with her toys and her baby gym, and won't always tolerate the carrier, so I don't know how to entertain her when she's awake save for holding her in my arms and walking around the house the entire time. Her naps during the day are either short or inconsistent, and again I have to be holding her or she wakes up instantly. So by the time evening rolls around I am exhausted, touched out and out of patience.

I have no help from family, friends etc and my husband works long hours. When she was a newborn he would take her for an hour or so when he got back from work so I could take a shower or have a moment to myself. But now she has started going to bed earlier, often before my husband even gets home from work, so I don't even have that anymore. It's basically me and baby all day, every day. 

I love her to bits but I'm exhausted. I don’t know what to do to make this bearable. I keep hearing others say that the worst is yet to come (teething, yet more growth spurts, etc) and I'm dreading all of it. ",4,1770139797.0,NewParents,9,0.83,False

I (39F) have been with my company for 7 years and have worked my way up from an entry level position to managing two offices. I have put my heart, soul and countless hours into this company. I wouldn't say it's my passion, but I am highly dedicated and enjoy the work most days. I have always had a good, healthy working relationship with my boss (the owner, 40M). 

Here lies my problem. My boss is at the beginning of a separation/divorce. It has been messy and he's dealing with a lot personally. In the mean time, he has hired two new women to the office who are stunningly beautiful, smart, and-coincidentally-just his type. 

At first, I was elated to have smart, competent coworkers-until he started favoring them in very obvious ways. Remembering their coffee orders and celebrating anniversaries (never has done this with anyone else), chit chatting with them at every free moment, taking them to lunch, etc. Whenever one of them is around specifically, I can't get him to focus at all. Our relationship has grown distant and it is really hurtful. I hate to say this, but it has taken a toll on my mental health and self-worth (for context, I really enjoy these women).

We have a pretty close relationship, so I felt comfortable enough to sit him down last week and explain how it was making me feel. He genuinely seemed to feel bad and has been making more of an effort with me but it feels forced. Since our meeting, he set up a lunch date with one of the girls and has yet to message me back on a work-related question.

Am I just feeling jealous/threatened? Or are my feelings valid? I just want to have a good, professional working relationship. I suddenly feel like my contributions are invisible, and feel a strong sense that he would like to replace me with someone nicer to look at.

1quy9o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMidnightArchives/comments/1quy9o1/dollimination/,Dollimination,"There are voodoo secrets unknown to society at large, never reaching documentaries or speculative fiction. For example, most laymen rest assured, assuming that since they’ve never met a witch doctor, such a personage couldn’t possibly possess an item personal enough to that layman—hair, toenail, Band-Aid, or whatever—to permit any hexes against them. But in fact, the very best voodoo dolls are produced from self-portraits, a person’s self-image filtered through whatever illustrative skill they possess. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley Clarke, he learned of that voodoo secret from a haggish Starbucks patron, who took offense when he opted not to sign her outthrust comic book—*The Unspooling* issue eight—which he’d written and illustrated some years prior. In Bradley’s defense, the woman had clumsily bumped his table and toppled his cappuccino, and he was frantically napkin-dabbing his slacks when the comic materialized from the depths of her Burberry backpack. 

 

“I’m a fan of your work,” the woman assured him. Still, he waved her away. He’d been getting recognized often lately; it was annoying. 

 

“Get lost, you old bitch,” he grunted, taking no small measure of joy as he watched her face crumple into a downcast expression, one incongruous with the psychedelic shawl that she wore.

 

Through her tears and livid shaking, the old gal muttered, “No, no, you shouldn’t have. You shouldn’t…you shouldn’t have done it.”

 

“Your parents shouldn’t have spawned you, so go find a bridge to live under,” Bradley countered. “That’s right, I just called you a troll. What can *you* do about it? As a matter of fact, were it up to me, people like you wouldn’t be allowed to read my comics in the first place.”      

 

“People like me? *People like me?* You dare insult hoodooists?”

 

“Hoodooists? Is that what inbred hags call themselves nowadays?” 

 

“Inbred? *Inbred!* What the heck is your problem? I approached you politely, humbly requesting an autograph, and you went and treated me like week-old, diseased spittle. Someone…*somebody* needs to teach you a lesson!” 

 

“Lesson, huh? Talk about lessons after you graduate from kindergarten, ya empty-headed spastic. They should stick you on an island—or better yet, under one.” *Wow, I’m really laying into her, aren’t I?* Bradley thought, delighted. *What’s gotten into me today? Surely, spilled coffee alone can’t shape me into someone this sinister? Have I forgotten something I should be pissed-off about?*     

 

Seemingly shrinking two inches, the elderly lady flung her entire physicality into a quivering tirade, a finger-waving string of invectives. Mangling much conjugation, interspersing four-letter nastiness every five words or so, she explained that thing about voodoo (you know, from this story’s first paragraph).

 

“I have your self portrait!” she added. “You’re sure in for it, buddy!” To better illustrate her assertion, she opened Bradley’s comic and pointed out its protagonist in a succession of images. Bradley hadn’t just been *The Unspooling*’s creator, you see, he’d also been its star, having written the tale about his experiences as he wrote the tale. It was one of those meta sort of pieces, that certain types of people relate to. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley, those kinds of fans didn’t mesh well with him in public. Frankly, most looked as if they were about to sneeze on him—and sometimes did, for that matter. Often, they’d demand to take a photo with Bradley, even though he hated to be photographed, due to that wart on his cheek that resembled a nipple. Never were they voluptuous groupies, or even related to any.        

 

“Come on, lady,” groaned Bradley. “We both know that voodoo’s not real. You’re only degrading that issue’s value…when it was Very Fine to begin with, tops.”  

 

“I’m gonna curse you, boy! Curse you bad! A real bad curse! Then I’m gonna tell my online hoodooist group all about it! Best believe!”

 

“Online hoodooist group? *Online hoodooist group!* Lady, I thought those Sarah McLachlan animal cruelty videos were the saddest thing I ever saw. Then you came into my life. I tell ya, my soul weeps.” 

 

“Soul?” she yelped. “Soul, sir…your soul is, is…is curdled. In fact, say goodbye to your soul. It’s…muh-muh-mine.” 

 

*Yeah, she looks like she’s gonna sneeze, alright*, Bradley thought.

 

“Mine!” the woman shrieked, before thundering right out of the Starbucks. 

 

“Hers,” Bradley laughed, making his way to the counter to attain a coffee to go. He decided to throw away his slacks the very instant he got home, to better help him forget the encounter.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Naturally, forgetting the encounter wasn’t the coffee spiller’s intention. Matilda Grieves was her name. Fuming was her mentality, inundated by recollections of past insults, the sort that had shaped her into a hoodooist to begin with. 

 

Powering on her MacBook, she announced, “I’ll show him, yes, yes. I’ll make every second of every minute of his every day agonized. *The Unspooling* fooled me good. I actually thought Bradley-\*asshole-\*Clarke to be a kindred spirit. Never again, I say. Never, never. That snobby jerk thinks he’s so great. Well, I’ll show him, yes I will.” 

 

With her laptop’s built-in webcam, Matilda recorded a simple how-to video, which she immediately uploaded to her hoodooist group’s website. In the video, she used scissors to cut out a front profile illustration of Bradley Clarke, from *The Unspooling*’s seventh issue, and then a back profile illustration, from *The Unspooling* issue four, of roughly equivalent dimensions. She then traced both onto canvas, cut it carefully, and sewed everything together, stuffed with yarn. Just as simple as that, Bradley had been reproduced in effigy. 

 

In closing, Matilda snarled at the webcam and exhorted, “This comic book bastard mocked us, my sisters. He thinks we’re pathetic, a buncha inbred hags playin’ make-believe. So let’s teach him a lesson—all of us, together, today. Make voodoo dolls of your own, and we’ll hit Mr. Clarke with enough hexes to leave his doomed, bastard head spinnin’.”

 

As dozens of her web chums placed same-day delivery orders, or busily bustled their way to comic book dealers, Matilda took her Bradley doll for a spin. 

 

First, she made the thing do the splits. 

 

And lo and behold, in another part of the city, Bradley found himself plummeting painfully upon his testicles, legs pointed eastward and westward. Shrieking, he rolled onto his side, only to find his left foot flying into his face, over and over. “What’s happening?” he wailed. 

 

“It worked, I can feel it,” Matilda declared, alone in her bedroom. Frankly, the power she felt coursing through her body aroused her sexually. Fantasizing about rubbing the doll against her erogenous zones, she became flush-faced, and had to remind herself that she absolutely hated Bradley Clarke. 

 

Palpitating, she decided to take an especially lengthy cold shower. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

There are voodoo secrets unknown even to most hoodooists. Prime amongst them is the effect that multiple voodoo dolls have on their subject. I mean, how many people are deemed so reprehensible that they garner drastic measures from not just one, but multiple hexers? That percentage is so infinitesimal, it was previously unheard of. 

 

While Matilda showered, the first of her confrères completed her own Bradley doll. The very moment that she finished sewing the thing together, an astounding process commenced. Seated in his kitchen with an icepack on his scrotum, Bradley felt himself being tugged by an invisible force. “Ahhhh!” he hollered, gritting what felt like too many teeth, assailed by a splitting headache. 

 

*I’m exchanging stature for breadth*, he thought, shrinking and widening. Arms sprouted from his neck. His genitals doubled, as did his legs. His vision temporarily dilated, as he fell off of his chair while remaining seated. 

 

Due to an inexplicable binary fission, there were now two Bradley Clarkes, each half the size and weight of the original. Even his clothing—jeans and an Indian Jewelry shirt, the one with the drippy lips—had doubled and shrunk, though the ice pack remained singular. 

 

“What the hell is this?” both Bradleys asked, synchronized. Then, suddenly, the floored Bradley was slapping his own face with alternating palms, whilst the other Bradley watched, quite perplexed. And even as that occurred, flesh began to stream from both his self-slapping and seated selves. Amalgamating, it formed a third Bradley—the same size as those two, who had shrunken. 

 

Reclining, the new Bradley slid up the wall, then back down to the floor, then right back up the wall, even as his flesh streamed to help form a fourth Bradley. 

 

And that’s how it continued. Bradleys contributed mass to new Bradleys. Ceaselessly shrinking, they endured every painful calamity those distant hoodooists saw fit to send over. One’s leg twisted so severely that bone shards poked out in three places; another found himself blinded as both his eyes imploded. A few danced without rhythm, or leapt far higher than they ought to have. Soon, the kitchen was filled with Bradleys, which was when the deaths began. 

 

One Bradley went up in flames; another endured a waterless drowning. Four strangulated themselves purple-faced. A Bradley spun his head off his shoulders while dancing a jig. Another was crumpled into a ball hardly recognizable as human. Replicated shrieks filled the residence, which might have reached the ears of 911-dialing neighbors, were any home from work at the time.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Matilda’s hoodooist network was far larger than one might suspect, and the ratio of live Bradleys to dead ones kept increasing. In fact, the process soon prompted the most clandestine of voodoo secrets to manifest. 

 

You see, when a voodoo doll’s subject is shrunken smaller than their effigy, they effectively become their voodoo doll’s doll. Unseen, true musculature blossoms within canvas. Eyes of glossy, illustrated paper become fully functional. Faux fingers flex as functioning digits. 

 

Ergo, even as the hoodooists contorted and mangled their respective dolls, cackling, they were unaware that such actions no longer affected any Bradley. Indeed, abandoning their physicality, each Bradley now bided his time as a spirit existing inside his own effigy. 

 

Each would wait until their hexer was vulnerable—sleeping, reading, or otherwise distracted—and then they’d enact their revenge. They’d gather knifes, razors, knitting needles, and other sharp implements, and assail hoodooist flesh with all proper animus. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The original Bradley doll trudged toward a bathroom, wherein a showered Matilda was toweling herself dry. Awkwardly, he clutched a pair of scissors, which he’d discovered beneath her living room sofa. 

 

*I’ll give that old bitch her autograph after all*, he thought, grinning paper lips. *I’ll carve it in permanent, and see how she likes it.* ",2,1770139778.0,TheMidnightArchives,0,1.0,False

Have you ever heard a preach about the glorious wonders of our lifeline and most important sustenance, water? Well, now you shall. Ah, water! The liquid symphony that dances through our lives, a veritable aquatic ballet where every molecule pirouettes in a celestial choreography. It’s the H2O show that keeps us on our toes and hydrated. Why, without water, we'd be drier than a sandpaper convention in the Sahara!

Consider the marvel of rain: tiny droplets that descend from the heavens like a million liquid blessings, giving us reason to splash in puddles and pretend we're amphibious royalty. Have you ever seen a fish frown? No, because they’re immersed in water's eternal embrace, living the dream we can only experience in our bathtubs with rubber ducky regalia.

And speaking of baths, let us not forget the bath! The holy ritual where mere mortals become aquatic deities in a porcelain temple, draped in bubbles that sing the praises of cleanliness. With water, we wash away our sins and our Monday blues, emerging from the depths like a pruney, rejuvenated Poseidon ready to face the week.

Oh, the flavors of water! Some say it's tasteless, but those poor souls have never experienced the zest of a freshly purified drop, as refreshing as a mountain spring at dawn. And who could overlook the artistry of ice? Frozen water that turns ordinary beverages into chilling masterpieces, making lemonade a summer sensation and turning a simple soda into an arctic adventure.

Moreover, water is the grand maestro behind coffee and tea, those elixirs that transform us from groggy gremlins into functioning humans each morning. A simple bean or leaf, when united with hot water, becomes a potion of power, capable of lifting spirits and inspiring sonnets.

Have I mentioned its versatility? Water can take the shape of whatever container it occupies, like a liquid Houdini performing escape acts in the confines of our kitchenware. From the grandeur of an ocean to the humility of a teacup, it adapts, proving that flexibility isn't just for yoga enthusiasts but for elements as well.

In conclusion, let us raise our glasses—not with mere liquid, but with the essence of life itself, water. Whether it's quenching our thirst, cleansing our bodies, or simply swirling elegantly in a wine glass as we contemplate its mysteries, water is the unsung hero of our daily dramas. So, here’s to water, the ever-astonishing, shape-shifting, life-giving marvel that deserves not just a toast but an entire operatic aria!",3,1770139733.0,Isekai,4,1.0,False

1quy8o8,/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1qgatt6/sats_7day_manifestation_challenge/,Manifestation success with Neville Goddard + Louise Hay affirmations ✨ The “impossible” apartment became real,"Hey everyone,
I want to share a manifestation story that still feels unreal to me and truly strengthened my belief in the power of state of being + SATS.
The main affirmation I worked with (Louise Hay):
“I see myself living in a wonderful place. It fulfills all my needs and desires. It's in a beautiful location and at a price I can afford.”

About a month ago, I decided I wanted to move. I wanted a bigger apartment, but in the exact same area where I already live, because the neighborhood is absolutely beautiful. The problem? It was basically impossible.They don’t accept new members.Waiting lists are at least 2 years.
I sent emails to agencies, no success at all. Everyone was complaining about how hard is to find an apartment.

The turning point
One weekend I went on a hike with some friends. It was a perfect winter day: forest, snow, fresh air. I felt completely relaxed, happy, and peaceful.
On the way back home, I randomly decided to get off the train one stop earlier and walk. As I was passing by the exact building with those apartments, in that calm and joyful state, I thought: “How nice it would be to live in an apartment here.”
When I got home, I saw that on that exact day I had received an email from the agency that owns those apartments, asking me to contact them. I was shocked.

SATS
The next day I tried calling them, but no answer. 
That same evening, I saw a post by Egyptian_Queen on r/NevilleGoddard where she suggested doing SATS together. So that night, I closed my eyes and imagined myself drinking coffee on the balcony, feeling the cold metal of the railing in my hand. I felt it as real and then I fell asleep.

The bridge of events
The next afternoon, the agency called me and offered me a viewing in two weeks. A balcony apartment. In that exact building.
They also said there would be many candidates and not to get my hopes up because they have strict criteria.
The price? Ridiculously low, considering similar apartments in that area are about 75% more expensive.
But I wasn’t worried at all. I knew it was already mine. I started planning the move, looking for furniture, imagining my life there.

Today was the viewing. There were 5 people.
They told us we would get an answer on Thursday.
Five hours later, I got the call: I got the apartment.

The key for me was:
1. Manifest from a state of deep peace and happiness.
(For me, it happened naturally after a relaxing hike.)
2. Do SATS and feel it real.
Not force, not stress — just gently experience it.
3. Then let go and live normally.
No obsession. No worrying. Just trust.

When you are truly in a state of inner calm and fulfillment, reality rearranges itself effortlessly. ✨",7,1770139721.0,NevilleGoddard,1,1.0,False

I have an active social life, I workout regularly, I have career goals I’m striving towards, I usually have home projects or side goals I’m working on like home decorating projects and stuff. 

When my husband and I first started dating we’d go hiking together, we’d take trips, go to big events, regular dinners with friends, date nights, we’d gym together, he had career goals he was working on. 

But after we moved in together he stopped wanting to do anything early in the morning. Then he stopped wanting to do anything too crowded. Trips became scarce. 

I didn’t mind it though, I felt like our mismatch helped us have more balance. So I went out less than my norm and he’d go out more than his norm and it was kind of a balancing act that helped us appreciate our differences. 

After having kids and Covid and everything, he doesn’t really want to do much of anything anymore. 

I still plan trips and things for the family and he’ll oblige, with complaint. Luckily he’s fine w me going on girls trips with my friends a couple times a year and he’s happy to hang back and watch the kids. And I usually have a couple work trips. 

Not that I need to travel to be happy. I’m happy to just explore our city more, but he’ll sort of compromise on 1 outing per week, like maybe a coffee shop or a playground. Then it’s back home to play video games and relax. 

He doesn’t plan anything for the family, anything unique we take the kids to is because I organized it. I’ve asked him for years to take over planning date nights for us and he doesn’t. He’s doesn’t plan or organize anything because of his ADHD. So mental load stuff is all me. 

He’s just a homebody. We get along great, we laugh and have fun together. But yeah he doesn’t have any goals, he has a good stable career so he’s happy with that and I’m happy for him. But he is just happy to kind of exist and I’m not really like that. 

For many years our differences were something I appreciated. But I think now I’m finding myself getting frustrated he isn’t more similar. Or wondering if he’d be happier with someone more similar to him, someone who wants to spend all their free time at home playing video games. 

So now I do my traveling and outings with my friends mostly when it isn’t the stuff I plan for us with the kids. And I’m starting to feel a bit disconnected. 

I’m going to sign up for therapy soon to talk it through with a professional. But I was wondering if any of you are living with a similar mismatch? How does it work for you? Is there anything you’ve done that helps?",1,1770139629.0,Marriage,16,0.67,False

I (39F) have been with my company for 7 years and have worked my way up from an entry level position to managing two offices. I have put my heart, soul and countless hours into this company. I wouldn't say it's my passion, but I am highly dedicated and enjoy the work most days. I have always had a good, healthy working relationship with my boss (the owner, 40M). 

Here lies my problem. My boss is at the beginning of a separation/divorce. It has been messy and he's dealing with a lot personally. In the mean time, he has hired two new women to the office who are stunningly beautiful, smart, and-coincidentally-just his type. 

At first, I was elated to have smart, competent coworkers-until he started favoring them in very obvious ways. Remembering their coffee orders and celebrating anniversaries (never has done this with anyone else), chit chatting with them at every free moment, taking them to lunch, etc. Whenever one of them is around specifically, I can't get him to focus at all. Our relationship has grown distant and it is really hurtful. I hate to say this, but it has taken a toll on my mental health and self-worth (for context, I really enjoy these women).

We have a pretty close relationship, so I felt comfortable enough to sit him down last week and explain how it was making me feel. He genuinely seemed to feel bad and has been making more of an effort with me but it feels forced. Since our meeting, he set up a lunch date with one of the girls and has yet to message me back on a work-related question.

Am I just feeling jealous/threatened? Or are my feelings valid? I just want to have a good, professional working relationship. I suddenly feel like my contributions are invisible, and feel a strong sense that he would like to replace me with someone nicer to look at.

I am starting to think that my time is coming to an end on this job, but I have no college degree and the thought of starting over is so scary. Should I leave my job?",1,1770139621.0,careerguidance,1,1.0,False

My significant other and I are in our mid-20s and currently living in North Dakota. We’re planning a move later this year (late summer / early fall) and are deep in the research phase — trying to balance lifestyle fit with real-world practicality.

We’re not looking for “perfect,” and we’re very open to hearing the downsides. We’d really appreciate insight from people who actually live in (or have lived in) the places below.

**What we’re hoping for:**

* Small town or small city feel (not a big metro)
* Strong access to nature (mountains, trails, water, open land)
* A couple good local coffee shops / third-place vibes
* Tattoo-friendly culture (we’re not in the industry, just part of the culture)
* Thrift/vintage stores and some creative or artsy energy
* At least some access to natural/organic food (co-ops, markets, etc.)
* Slower pace of life and good quality of day-to-day living + creative like-minded people

**Towns/areas we’re currently looking at (no particular order):**

* Cottonwood, AZ
* Trinidad, CO
* Boone, NC
* Abingdon, VA
* Staunton, VA
* Johnson City / Tri-Cities, TN (jonesborough, bristol, abingdon)
* Hot Springs, AR
* Eureka Springs, AR
* Weaverville / Black Mountain, NC
* Sylva, NC
* Prescott, AZ

**Things we’re especially curious about:**

* Housing reality (rent availability, competition, seasonal pressure)
* Cost of living vs local wages
* Community vibe (welcoming vs insular, transient vs rooted)
* Tourism impact (if any)
* Anything people tend to romanticize but later regret

We know every place has tradeoffs — we’re just trying to choose ones that feel livable and aligned long-term rather than flashy. If you’ve lived in any of these places (or seriously considered them), we’d love to hear what daily life is *actually* like.

Thanks so much in advance — this sub has been incredibly helpful while we’ve been figuring all this out.

That was rare. We exchanged contact information and kept in touch for a few weeks. Then we decided to have coffee together. Nothing fancy, a no pressure meet-up at a little waterfront cafe with good online reviews. I ordered an Americano. She ordered a cinnamon flavoured latte. “It's nice to see you again,” I said when she sat down. “Likewise,” she said. It was just after six o'clock on a Tuesday evening. Her name was Veronica Chapman.

She was sweet, confident without being arrogant, willing to listen as well as speak. She had brown eyes and light hair, which I note not because I fell in love with her but because I *don't* have brown eyes and light hair, and I need to remind myself that she and I are not the same person, even though it sometimes feels like we are, and Norman never did believe that we met by chance that afternoon on the subway, but that is how it happened, and how it happened led to our date in the coffee shop.

“What else do you read?” I asked.

“Oh, anything,” said Norman.

“Really?”

“Unless it was published after 1995. Then I wouldn't read it,” I said.

“So, not into contemporary lit,” said Veronica Chapman.

“Not really,” I said.

“Shame.”

“Why's that?” Norman asked.

“Because I'm a bit of a writer myself, and I was hoping you might like reading what I write,” I said. “I'm no Faulkner, but I'm not bad either.”

“Some people might say if you're not like Faulkner, that makes you good,” he said.

“Would you say that, Norman?” she asked.

“I wouldn't,” I said. “I like Faulkner.”

“Me too.”

I wanted to say: I write too; but I took a drink of coffee instead. It was good. The reviews didn't lie. I let the taste overcome my tongue before swallowing. “I write too,” I said. “Not for money or anything. Just for fun. What do you write—are you published?” I asked.

“Self-published,” she said.

“And I write stories. I post them online. Maybe it's silly. I had a Tumblr. Before that, a MySpace page.”

“I don't think it's silly. Not at all,” said Norman.

“Thanks,” I said.

She sipped her latte. “MySpace. Wow. You must have been writing for a while,” he added.

“Yeah.”

“What genre do you write in?”

“I've tried a few, but what I write doesn't usually fall into any one genre. It's kind of funny but also kind of horrific, sometimes absurd. Sometimes it's whatever I happen to be reading, like, by reading I'm eating an author's style—which I then regurgitate back onto the page.”

“I know what you mean. I do that too. It's like I'm a literary sponge.”

“What makes my writing mine is the setting: the world I set my stories in. Everything else is borrowed.”

“What's the setting?” I asked.

“A place called New Zork City,” said Veronica Chapman.

I nearly spat my Americano into her smiling face. I must have misheard.  “New *York* City?” I said.

“No, not New *York*. New *Zork*.” She must have seen my expression change: to one of shock—disbelief. “It's like New York but isn't New York. It's like a bizarro version of New York City. Not that I've ever been to New York City,” she said, to which I said: “I write New Zork City.”

“Pardon?”

“New *Zork* City—Zork: like the old text adventure game. *I* write stories set in New Zork City.”

“I write New Zork City.”

“Here. Look,” I said, pulling out my phone, opening my personal subreddit. “See? All these stories are set in New Zork. It's my world, not yours.”

“When did you write your first New Zork story?”

“Angles,” I said. “Two years ago.”

“Moises Maloney, acutization, the old man from Old New Zork, his exploding head, Thelma Baker, deadly nostalgia,” said Veronica Chapman.

“That's right,” I said.

“I wrote that one over a decade ago, and it wasn't even my first story.” She showed me her Tumblr. There it was: my story, *i.e.* her story, word-for-word the same but posted in 2014. I couldn't argue with a timestamp.

“That's impossible,” I said.

She said, “I wrote my first one in elementary school, a poem that referenced Rooklyn.”

And she showed that to me too. It was a photo of a handwritten piece of paper, the writing neat but obviously a child's,  predating my version of “Angles” by nearly a lifetime. “It's—” I started to say, to dispute: but dispute what? If the poem had been printed I could have argued it was a typo, automatic capitalisation, but it wasn't. “That could have been written at any time,” I said, and I pulled out an elementary school yearbook from the nineteen-nineties, in which the poem had been reproduced, and showed it to Norman Crane, who was speechless, his eyes darting from the yearbook to me, to the yearbook to—

“You came prepared,” he said in the tone of an accusation. “Nobody just walks around with a copy of their eighth grade yearbook. You sought me out. We didn't meet by coincidence. What is this? Who are you, and what the hell do you want from me?”

He was obviously distressed.

“No, it wasn't a coincidence,” I conceded. “I came across your stories online a few months ago and recognised them as my stories,” I told him. “Why are you ripping me off?”

“Me? I'm—I'm not ripping you off! My stories are my own: originals.”

“Yet they're clearly not,” said Veronica Chapman, and somewhere deep down I knew she was right. I mean: I wrote them, but they had come to me too easily, too fully formed. I had merely transcribed them.

“I'm not angry. I just want you to stop,” she said.

Then she bent forward and put one hand under the table we were sitting on opposite sides of.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“I have a gun,” she whispered, and I felt sweat start to run down the back of my neck, and I felt my hand hold the gun under the table pointed at Norman, and I felt having Veronica Chapman point the gun at me. “I know you have a good imagination,” she said. “Which means I know it doesn't matter whether I actually have a gun or not. You can imagine I do, and that's enough. In fact, you can't help but imagine it. You're probably trying to visualize what it looks like—the sound it would make if I pulled the trigger—how much it would hurt to get shot, how your body would be pushed back by the impact. You're imagining what the reactions would be: mine, everyone else's. You're imagining the blood, the wound, the beautiful warmth; pressing your hand against it, seeing yourself bleed out…”

“And all you want is for me to stop writing stories about New Zork City,” I said.

She was right: I couldn't stop imagining.

“Yes, that's all I want from you,” I said, keeping the imagined gun trained on Norman. “They're not your stories. Stop pretending they are.”

Norman squirmed.

To everybody else in the coffee place we were just two people on a date.

“Finish your Americano, forget New Zork and go on with the rest of your life. Imagine this never happened,” I said. “That's safest for both of us.”

“Even if you did write the stories first—”

“I did,” she said.

“Fine. You wrote them first. But how do you know nobody wrote them before you did? Maybe your claim to them is no better than mine.”

Veronica Chapman laughed. “It's not just about who's first, Norman. It's about power: the power of imagination. I bet, until now, you've never met anyone who could imagine the way you can. That's fair. You're not bad, Norman. You're not bad at all—but you're not the best, and New Zork City belongs to the best.”

All I could do was watch her.

“What's the source?” I asked finally, imagining her as a girl standing over my dead body, sitting down, putting a notebook filled with lined sheets of paper on my chest and writing her poem about Rooklyn. “Where does it all come from? To me, to you…”

“I don't know.”

“How many others have you found?”

“Three.”

“And how did—”

“They were persuadable.”

I didn't believe her. I didn't believe there were others. I didn't  believe her imagination was greater than mine. I didn't believe in her at all.

“Do you agree to stop writing New Zork City, Norman?” she asked.

“No,” I said.

“Then give me your hand,” she said, holding out the one she wasn't using to maybe-threaten me with a gun. “We'll have a battle of imaginations.”

“What?”

“We hold hands and try to imagine the world, each without the other.”

“Put away the gun,” I said.

“What gun?” Both her hands were on the table. She was finishing up her latte. I still had a third of my cooling Americano. “There is no gun.”

If I could imagine the Karma Police, a conquistador in Maninatinhat, a Voidberg, surely I can imagine a world without Veronica Chapman, I thought and took her hand in mine. Squeezing, we both closed our eyes. How romantic. How utterly, perversely romantic. But try as I might, I couldn't do it: I couldn't imagine Veronica Chapman out of existence. She was always there, on the margins. Even when I was writing, whispering into my ear. Maybe I *was* in love with her. Maybe. Whispering, whispering, Norman with his two eyes closed, Norman squeezing my hand, his grip getting weaker and weaker until there is no grip—until there is no Norman, and I get up and pay for my latte and the unfinished Americano in the cup on the other side of the empty table.

“I guess he didn't show up,” says the barista.

“Yeah,” I say.

“His loss, I'm sure.”

“Thanks. It's probably not the last time I'll be stood up,” I say with a shrug, and I go home. I go home to write.",2,1770139225.0,normancrane,2,1.0,False

1quxycw,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoFriend/comments/1quxycw/my_friend_who_caused_issues_throughout_pregnancy/,My 'friend' who caused issues throughout pregnancy decided im an asshole... for putting my child first,"Hello! First time posting here! This is about to get long so buckle up for the ride!

So a bit of backstory is needed, but this is regarding a situation regarding my child and how my 'friend' thinks they should rank above them. Spoiler alert: They dont. 

There are a few recurring people, who we will call, Damon (my partner and my childs father), Charity (One of my best friends), Sasha (another of my best friends), Karen (The nightmare) and my child Indigo.

Early 2024, i started doing a bunch of local free courses, to try and get out more after a serious battle with my mental health, and learn some new crafting skills etc. It was during one of these courses that i met Karen. at the time she seemed lovely and we became friends, seeing each other fairly regularly at the courses we both attended. 

Mid 2024 i became pregnant and was excited beyond belief to tell people, one of which was Karen as i genuinely thought we were pretty close. Unfortunately 8 weeks into this, i suffered a miscarriage and lost my child. I wont go into details, but the whole situation was incredibly traumatic given how it all went down.  Damon and I were heartbroke but neither of us wanted to wait around to try again. During this time Charity took me to a couple of appointments i needed to attend that Damon couldnt, Sasha was there for me the whole time, and Karen was actually really sweet, creating a memorial for my little one using the skills we had learned in the courses we attended. I still have it as it was incredibly thoughtful.

  
A month later, guess whos pregnant again? If you guess me you get a cookie and a gold star. This time, we waited longer to tell people, and as you can imagine i was /terrified/ of losing this one too. Eventually we started telling people, and immediately Sasha and Charity wanted to plan a baby shower for me. When i told Karen, she asked if she could help. We'd been friends about 6 months at this point so i said sure, and we created a group chat to discuss all the details.

  
This is where shit hits the fan a bit. I don't really know what happened in her head but something changed. My friends were helping me, but i still wanted input in my baby shower as my aesthetic is important to me (I'm Pagan and Goth). We weren't finding out the gender until LO was born, so we had a wide range of choices for everything. So i wanted witchy vibes, but immediately Karen comes in trying to /tell/ me i was having a pastel theme, and shed been searching and finding everything in sage green. Its a nice colour, but its not me at all. We finally settled on a palette that was more me and moved on.

 During the planning process Karen was an utter nightmare. And i mean a nightmare. I have the receipts for all of this by the way, cause i know this sounds utterly batshit insane. But here are some highlights of the planning:

\- Complained in the baby shower group chat that i shared pregnancy updates with them... In the group chat about the damn baby...

\- Tried to control the food so it was /all/ suitable for her. She wanted halal food despite being the only person who needs it, when i was already trying to cater to the 3 Vegans, 4 Vegetarians, and Damon who is Keto and Gluten-Intollerant. Most of the food was suitable for her, everything that wasnt meat was totally suitable for her by design, and we couldnt get Halal from where we were doing the shopping for the food. But we absolutely made sure she could eat. I even said if she wanted Halal meat thats fine but she would need to provide it for herself and we would keep it safe in the kitchen for her, just like we were doing with Damons food.

\- Turned around and made out that her religion is the only real religion, telling me that my gods are just spirits and not really real. 

\- 2 months out from the babyshower i wanted to get together and actually start ordering decorations, and sort out the shopping list and plan for the shower set up itself. She messaged Charity telling her i was getting stressed and didnt understand why i was panicking... when we hadnt done anything to get ready yet. Don't worry Charity had my back. Shes a real one guys.

\- Everytime we tried to make plans so everyone could attend, she would try and push Sasha out of the loop. We didnt let that happen.

\- Barely helped with prep before the shower, and showed up late to every meeting we had. Im heavily pregnant by this point and exhausted so i just wanted to get things done but had to wait hours for her to show up. Whenever she did show up, it was me Charity and Sasha who did the work really. 

\- When planning the food, everyone was willing to split the costs (which i appreciate beyond belief), Charity and Sasha both picked up various items to add to their costs on top of the basic buffet being split between the 4 of us. Karen didnt pick up anything and left it all to us. I know im not entitled to anyones money, and absolute appreciate the girls helping where they could, but she did leave it all to us 3 after begging to be involved.

\- I asked Charity for some specialty food that she introduced me too, so she decided to get it for me as a babyshower gift. Due to Damon being gluten intollerant, he couldnt eat it so i asked if she would put his share of said items aside for me to take home. Karen immediately decides shes doing the same, and also helping herself to the buffet before the guests even arrived. We shut that shit down immediately, the food was for all the guests, the only reason i was getting extra was because my partner couldnt eat it, they're my favourite, and they were a gift for me.

\- Spent the entire pregnancy trying to get me to tell her our childs name, even though she knew we were keeping it to ourselves. No one knew the name till they were born

  


The whole planning process was utter chaos. During this time as well, im going through various issues with the pregnancy, my dads incredibly poorly, and we're also having to put so much effort into getting the house ready and prepped for a child its just insane. Things were hell for me on the leadup to the baby shower. At this point ive known Karen about a year, and for the most part shes done nothing but cause issues.

Day before the shower comes, Karen was supposed to help myself and Charity get the buffet made and over to the venue. She didnt show up. Sasha and her partner come after work to pick up the decorations from Charity's house and im sent home, very heavily pregnant by this point. They know my vision for the venue, but im told im not allowed to see it till the shower tomorrow. Honestly these girls... I dont know what id do without them.

The next day comes, Sasha, Charity and their partners all go to the venue to finish putting up the decorations before the guests and I arrive. Guess who didnt show up to help... again? If you guess Karen you earned a second cookie! She actually showed up /after/ i arrived. The shower thankfully went off without a problem until the very end. I thanked all 3 of them for their help, even though id been so miffed by Karens attitude the whole time, and gave them all a small gift to say thankyou for their help. Yes i know a little people pleasing given that Charity and Sasha work theit asses off. 

One of the specialty items id asked for was something Charity cooked herself, and knew i wanted some to take home. Yeah... Karen took the /lot/ were talking like 6 bowls leaving me with none to take home. I brushed it off as Charity had made sure i had basically every left over of the other stuff so i could survive. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks, and i get some horrendous news. My dad? Cancer. Very agressive. All over his body. Basically just a waiting game. 

And then i give birth. Im close with my dad, so hes the first person to find out his grandchild is here, and then a week after was the first to hold Indigo other than me, Damon, and hospital staff. It was so important to me that they had that given we knew we didnt have long with him.

Charity and Sasha were so helpful during this time, Charity actually cleaned the house and looked after our cats whilst i was in hospital, and they were both there for me no matter the time, along with Damon of course. So i'm a new mum, with a breastfed newborn, exhausted and sleep deprived and trying to adjust to the new reality.

And then my dad dies. Indigo was 8 weeks old. Honestly im still not ok. I miss him everyday but im so happy he got to meet his grandchild. Part of me is convinced he held on to meet them and then let himself just... let go. Indigos middle name is named after him as well, so im so glad that he got to know just how much i love him. 

Once again, Charity and Sasha were my rocks, they checked on em regularly, and were over to help me with housework etc as often as they could be, and Damon was my absolute rock. Karen? Nowhere to be seen, except when asking to see Indigo. I'd been saying she could come and visit for a while but i was still in recovery, but no i had to schlep us both over to hers so she could see Indigo.

This wouldnt have been such a problem if she hadnt been so... weird... like... peering over the coffee tabel to watch as i changed Indigos nappy weird... along with saying 'is mummy starving you? its ok ill sneak you some food' when Indigo was only 3 months old and exclusively breastfed... it made me super uncomfortable, especailly when she took him into another room to see her mum. 

After this I started  to distance myself from her, i was exhausted and fed up of the constant drama, i did try to invite her out that week but she never responded and honestly taking care of Indigo and making sure my mental health didnt plummet was my main concern. I was barely speaking to anyone at this time, between navigating the newborn period, learning to be a mother, and grieving the loss of my dad, i went radiosilent for a bit, but Charity and Sasha understood and let me know they were there when i was ready and they loved me.

  
So for the last 5/6 months none of us have heard from Karen and things are blissfully peaceful. Until Yesterday when i recieved this text. It's a direct copy paste, but if people want the screen shot i'll happily provide it. Obviously names have been changed.



  
This message is not an invitation to respond.

I remained present and supportive while your life revolved around your pregnancy and your needs. Even when there was someone close to you who had plenty to say about you, I still showed up and helped you without hesitation. And now that Indigo is here, NOTHING else matters, or mattered. 

You then chose to cut me off without explanation or basic respect. That decision made one thing clear: you failed as a friend.

The world does not revolve around you. I will not accept being treated as disposable once I am no longer useful.

Your behaviour caused real damage. That is a consequence of how you chose to handle someone who was genuinely there for you.

I suggest you reflect seriously on how you treat people and ensure you do not repeat this pattern.

This contact ends here. I am permanently removing you from my life.

Good luck. Hopefully this sits with you for a while and makes you feel as confused and as upset about this as I have.





I'm baffled that she seems to think that she should rank above my child in my life... and of course /MY/ life revolves around /ME/ thats just how things work, and while i appreciate friends and family helping me, i never once expected anyone to center me in their lives. 

She also clearly is trying to put a wedge between me and Charity, by saying that someone had a lot to say about me, however i already know. Charity Sasha and i are all on the spectrums o were blunt as shit with each other. Its the easiest way for us to communicate, we literally call each other names and take the piss out of eachother constantly, its how we roll, so... nice try but its not going to work.

But her saying nothing matters other than Indigo? Obviously thats the case. Theyre 10 months old, and rely on me to take care of them, but i have been present witht the people who understand that my priorities have changed. 

Ive only known her about 2 years, whereas Charity and Sasha ive known a lot longer, we've all earned loyalty and love and understanding from each other by being there as much as is possible and understanding that sometimes life is stressful so we might not always be present, but it doesnt mean we love each other any less. Karen seems to feel entitled to that kind of friendship, without giving it in return.

1quxw6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1quxw6n/bittersweet_about_my_last_passholder_day/,Bittersweet about my last passholder day,"This week I was able to get off work on Monday and take one last solo day to the parks. Solo days are not my thing I have learned after several attempts--part 1 of why I'm not renewing my pass. Although I really enjoy doing an hour or two on my own while others are doing their thing, I really want to share the moments with other people for the most part (and the popcorn!). 

My goals: NO lightning lanes, no waiting in line for over 30 mins, and no buying food/drink I've had a lot of before (except churros).   
  
I drove to the Toy Story Parking Lot by 9:15 and confirmed with the attendant that the upcoming ART bus situation will have no effect on the Toy Story shuttles (probably you all knew that, but I was confused from a previous post here). It was uncrowded as heck in the lot, I got to park right by the bathrooms and walk to the bus in less than 5 mins. 

Monday still had some Run Disney folks, but luckily for me the majority of the crowd were not good at hacking Disneyland ... For instance, Indy was posted at 30 mins but I got to the front of the line in 15 simply by choosing the right lane at the stairs. Same for Big Thunder, skipped ahead easily. I sidled my way onto Haunted Mansion in similar record time, and after that I had my last churro for the foreseeable future. It was PERFECT, of course.

I single ridered Matterhorn and Space and then snacked and shopped in Galaxy's Edge, then stopped to people watch with a coffee on Main Street. I went into the magic shop and the magician demonstrated several magic tricks! Highly recommend this, it's not too well known I don't think. Main Street was pretty magical, Dapper Dans and the Band were both out and about. 

I park hopped to DCA and did Lunar New Year snacks and drinks (highly recommend everything, I did not have a miss). Incredicoaster was closed, as was Grizzly... so I only rode Soarin'. I wanted to ride Guardians but it was 55 mins and climbing; Radiator Springs was an easy Single Rider though. I thought about riding Monsters Inc. but went shopping instead (and now I want to kick myself). 

Things I will miss about being a passholder: 

* discount, though it's not all that much except making parking halfway reasonable.
* being able to make a day casual and not go all out--this is actually the single greatest benefit.
* getting access to special merch (some of it has been cool).

Things I will NOT miss about being a passholder:

* solo days are not for me! I really tried though.
* cost to use ratio, it's more than I am willing to pay at this time for the number of days I go. I think I went 15 or 16 days in total and although it was cost effective for that number of visits I don't care to repeat that. 
* res. system for passes. as a Believe Key holder I had several surprise blackout days sneak up on me, and several days I wanted to join people but didn't nab them in time.
* for me, overuse decreased the magic a bit. My best visits were taking people who had never been, or hadn't been in a long time. 

For this year, I will be sticking with local ticket discounts and taking my family to have hotel weekends. I also really prefer to hotel it nearby even though we are \~ 2hrs drive away. It is such a slog to drive back at night after a full day at the parks, and I like the mornings in the parks but rarely arrive in time to enjoy them when I drive.

* A few good local, more specialty coffee shops
* Tattoo-friendly culture (we’re not in the industry, just part of the culture)
* Thrift/vintage stores and a creative or artsy community
* Some access to natural or organic food options (co-ops, markets, etc.)
* Access to Ranches if possible (not necessary, just wanted)
* Overall slower pace and good quality of life

**Things we’re especially curious about:**

* Housing reality (rent availability, competition, seasonal pressure)
* Day-to-day cost of living vs wages
* Community vibe (welcoming? transient? tourist-heavy?)
* Anything people tend to romanticize — and later regret

I did the lunch tasting menu, Grand Amalia, 145 euros. From the first amuse bouche to the mignardises at the end, everything was just very solid. What I liked most is that the cooking takes real risks. Some combinations sound a bit crazy on paper, but they totally work. Nothing felt safe or boring.

A few dishes I absolutely loved. The spicy scallop with the green sauce was incredible, super punchy and fresh. The red mullet with beef bourguignon elements and a red wine sauce shouldn’t work, but somehow it really does, and it was one of my favorite courses. The wild duck with grapefruit and coffee sauce was also a standout, really well balanced and not heavy at all.

Desserts were great too. One of them was a goat cheese mousse with caramel and Dijon mustard. Again, sounds odd, but it was honestly delicious.

The open kitchen makes a big difference. Watching the whole team cook while you’re at the table is genuinely enjoyable, and it kind of clicks why the food is so good when you see how focused and precise everyone is.

I had two wines by the glass, one white and one red, and both pairings were spot on with the menu.

Service was excellent. Like, really excellent. I felt properly taken care of the whole time, without it ever feeling stiff or over the top. The sommelier and the servers were all great. At the end of the meal, I even had a short chat with the chef and his wife, who were both super nice, which was a very cool way to finish the lunch.

Overall, this feels like a very high level one star. Easily a place that could punch above its weight. I’d 100 percent recommend it, especially for lunch. The value for the experience is hard to beat.",13,1770138611.0,finedining,0,0.94,False

Desserts were great too. One of them was a goat cheese mousse with caramel and Dijon mustard. Again, sounds odd, but it was honestly delicious.

The open kitchen makes a big difference. Watching the whole team cook while you’re at the table is genuinely enjoyable, and it kind of clicks why the food is so good when you see how focused and precise everyone is.

I had two wines by the glass, one white and one red, and both pairings were spot on with the menu.

Service was excellent. Like, really excellent. I felt properly taken care of the whole time, without it ever feeling stiff or over the top. The sommelier and the servers were all great. At the end of the meal, I even had a short chat with the chef and his wife, who were both super nice, which was a very cool way to finish the lunch.

Overall, this feels like a very high level one star. Easily a place that could punch above its weight. I’d 100 percent recommend it, especially for lunch. The value for the experience is hard to beat.",4,1770138580.0,finedining,0,0.84,False
1quxoi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1quxoi2/new_to_pourover_v60_suggestions/,New to Pour-Over: V60 Suggestions?,"Hey all,

Just got into this all last week after binging lots of Hoffmann content. Currently have a 1 cup V60 and a TIMEMORE C3S. Brewed probably 8 cups in total using (his) 1 cup V60 technique, and up until cup 4, each was better than the last.

Now I'm at a bit of a weird spot with what's coming out. Currently brewing a medium roast Peruvian Single Origin. Grinding finer than suggested on the grinder for pour overs.

One click finer produces cups that are a little too bitter. There's some acid, but it's closer to a starbucks type coffee with how the bitterness masks other flavors, not just existing with them.

One click coarser produces cups that have comparatively little ""body,"" for lack of a better term. They are primarily acidic with next to no bitterness/sweetness. Maybe a tiny bit of sweetness if I really try to imagine its there.

Tasting notes are supposedly ""cherry, grape, pear, and 'easygoing caramel'""

While following the technique, my beds are consistently dry around the 2:30/2:40 mark, a good bit sooner than the 3:00 goalpost. This is with both cafec and hario filters. My beds are also very uniform and flat when dry, so I don't think I'm getting any channelling.

Using bottled ""purified water,"" and I experimented adding in a small amount of my (really hard) tap water. Noticed no difference lol. Heated using a fairly cheap kettle with an led temp display, first cups were straight off boil and others are at \~203°F (95°C). Noticed a slight improvement there.

I found a chart online with descriptions of flavors and mouth feel for pour over brews, and I'm seemingly flipping between ""slightly under"" and ""slightly over"" as indicated by the chart.

Maybe I'm overthinking it for only being a week in. I'm not disliking the cups I'm brewing, but I feel like I'm so tantalizingly close to getting a great cup. I'm definitely an experimentalist. Thoughts, comments, concerns appreciated.

Drinking cups black of course. Thanks.",3,1770138529.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

1quxo6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenAscending/comments/1quxo6r/tiny_fixes_for_a_tired_life_7_habits_that/,Tiny fixes for a tired life: 7 habits that actually make your life better,"Most people aren’t burned out because they’re doing “too much.” They’re tired because they’re doing the wrong things for too long. Scrolling, multitasking, saying yes out of guilt, pretending they can rest without actually resting, it adds up. Modern life wears people down like water on stone.



But here’s the thing: it’s not always about a massive overhaul. Sometimes the smallest tweaks give the biggest relief. Not from TikTok therapists, but straight from books, psychology research, and performance science.



Here are 7 tiny but powerful habits that actually help:



1. Start your day with 10 minutes of deliberate stillness.  

Not meditation. Just stillness. No phone, no to-do list, just breathing and being still. Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman explains on Huberman Lab that pausing first thing in the morning reduces cortisol spikes, which makes it easier to focus and stay calm all day.



2. Use “habit stacking” to rebuild energy.  

James Clear’s Atomic Habits introduced this idea: attach a new habit to something you already do. Example? Every time you brush your teeth, stretch for 30 seconds. After making coffee, write down one thing you’re grateful for. This rewires your brain to make positive changes automatic.



3. Get light exposure every morning.  

This isn’t a wellness gimmick. Stanford research shows that 5–10 minutes of natural light in the morning resets your circadian rhythm, boosts dopamine, and fights brain fog. It’s like caffeine without the crash. Just walk outside within an hour of waking up.



4. Limit decisions after 8 PM.  

Decision fatigue is real. A study from Columbia University found that judges were significantly more likely to deny parole later in the day. Why? Mental exhaustion. Give your evening brain a break. Plan your next day earlier. Stop doomscrolling at night, it ruins your rest.



5. Do a mini dopamine detox on Sundays.  

Not a monk-mode shutdown. Just one day with lower stimulation. No social media. No binge-watching. Just quiet stuff. Reading. Journaling. Walking. Cal Newport, in Digital Minimalism, shows how tech overload kills focus and peace. One “boring” day resets your brain’s baseline.



6. Protect the first hour of your workday like it’s sacred.  

No meetings. No emails. Just deep work. A Harvard Business Review study found that people who controlled their morning hours were 12% more productive and far less stressed. That’s a huge win for a tiny habit shift.



7. Move every 90 minutes.  

Not a full workout. Just stand, stretch, walk. According to Dr. Kelly McGonigal, author of The Joy of Movement, even 3 minutes of movement releases anti-anxiety brain chemicals. Sitting still too long kills both energy and mood.



None of these will change your life overnight. But stack them and your days get lighter. Your brain gets sharper. You stop feeling like life is something you have to survive.",1,1770138510.0,MenAscending,0,1.0,False

this has been really difficult having to basically have this “secret” to ourselves and it comes with a lot of complex emotions of not feeling like we are able to tell our parents and family.

with that being said, it’s been over a year and there have been multiple times when people bring up their views and i just sit there quietly. it’s gotten better but the first few times i was triggered and shocked.

i think a lot of people in our circle just assume that since my husband and i grew up going to church and follow jesus, we are obviously pro life.

my sweet naive grandma has made comments like “i don’t understand how anyone could willingly have that done” and i just sit there.

i went to a baby shower for my cousins wife and i asked how she was liking her obgyn to which she said that at her first appointment she told her doctor that she was very pro life and against abortion and her doctor was supportive of that. once again i just had to sit there and put on a face.

i recently reconnected with an old friend who has a 18 month old. i don’t have social media so i got on facebook as a browser and saw she was sharing a coffee brand that is pro life. she captioned that she feels led to “advocate for those babies without a voice since they can’t advocate for themselves. ouch..

anyone here who didn’t tell family and now deals with comments like this? how in the world am i suppose to cope and work on my healing journey when people in my circle are constantly throwing comments like this around?

1quxmc9,https://i.redd.it/dslr7lx9abhg1.jpeg,Shipping announcement to the community,"Good morning to everyone

Let me start with thanking you all. 

These last couple weeks have been a very trying time. 

Flu season, exhaustion, an avalanche of orders and a community give away to say thank you to you all!!  

Travis and I are so thankful to all of you for everything. 

You all have changed our lives. We have made new friends that could be lifetime friends beyond watches. 

You guys have placed a ton of faith into Travis and I to get the job done. 

And we appreciate that and I promise we aren’t squandering it. 

The one thing we have absolutely no control over is shipping delays. 

I know I needed to reroute some shipments for the safety of the watches but also for my own safety too. That was a non negotiable decision that I needed to make knowing full well that a seizure would not be replaced in time. 

So, a lot of watches are taking longer than expected to receive in the US. They are coming, and probably all going to land at the same time too… which will be….. interesting. (Lots of coffee those nights) 

The other side that I cannot control is UPS and FedEx shipping out to you. 

Sadly, I’m not Jeff Bezos, and I am not Amazon prime. I’m at the mercy of these transportation companies but more importantly, they are at the mercy of the horrible weather impacting every aspect of shipping. 

When severe weather grounds a flight in a snow storm, it creates the chain reaction of cancelled flights everywhere else. 

FedEx and UPS will not reimburse delays due to weather. 

Guys, I just need you all to be patient. 

If I had a teleportation machine to zap the watches to you, I would use it. lol. 

But please for now, while we are slammed with bad weather, please know that I’m not going to have the bandwidth to call UPS or FedEx over a package delay. 

Please know that the watch you ordered is coming. 

My eta is a guess 

They get here when they get here. 

As soon as they are in, I’ll let you know via DM. 

Thanks for understanding, I appreciate you all. 

Sincerely,

(What would fit our personalities best?),"I am moving with my roommate/best friend and we have about 4 months to save and prep for a big move out of our small college town in the midwest. I’ve honestly enjoyed it here and made a good time out of the resources but feel I could thrive in a bigger city. I am a teacher so I’d like good pay comparative to living costs. She is an accountant so that’s a factor too for job opportunities. 

We love new coffee shops, books, theatre, nature, and concerts.I personally really want to have some nature in my life for my mental health. 

It’s so hard to decide, Chicago is on the table since it is still in the midwest, but I can’t help but think it’d be too safe of an option. I want some adventure and to fulfill that need to explore.

My personality comes off a bit cold and reserved, but kind and helpful approached. I’d like to meet people who are queer and cool but not fake nice or overly into small talk. I admire charismatic people, but it’s not where i’d fit in. This is the hardest thing to gauge for me without ever living somewhere.

After her divorce and many short-term relationships, my mom finally has a boyfriend way younger than her who is in his late 20s. He oftem comes over to our house. Two days ago, he came over. He was giving my mom a foot massage and kissing her feet. Suddenly, I heard my mom screaming and it turned out her boyfriend bit her little toe (I guess something playful between them). My mom wrapped a band-aid around her little toe.

Yesterday, me and my mom went to my aunt's (47F) house. My mom was wearing sandals so she went barefoot in my aunt's house. My aunt saw the band-aid and asked what happened to her toe. My mom said she just stepped on a piece of glass.

Later, my mom was sitting with her feet up on the coffee table. My aunt's husband asked my mom what happened to her toe and I said her boyfriend bit her toe. I saw my mom's face changing and realized I was not supposed to say that. We both said I was joking and my mom actually stepped on a piece of glass. However, my aunt didn't seem convinced at all.

After we left, my mom was quite upset with me. She is still quiet angry at me for revealing something that personal. I regret for revealing her private life to my aunt.",11,1770137885.0,confessions,4,0.93,False
1quxd95,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpinalTapHorror/comments/1quxd95/dollimination/,Dollimination,"There are voodoo secrets unknown to society at large, never reaching documentaries or speculative fiction. For example, most laymen rest assured, assuming that since they’ve never met a witch doctor, such a personage couldn’t possibly possess an item personal enough to that layman—hair, toenail, Band-Aid, or whatever—to permit any hexes against them. But in fact, the very best voodoo dolls are produced from self-portraits, a person’s self-image filtered through whatever illustrative skill they possess. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley Clarke, he learned of that voodoo secret from a haggish Starbucks patron, who took offense when he opted not to sign her outthrust comic book—*The Unspooling* issue eight—which he’d written and illustrated some years prior. In Bradley’s defense, the woman had clumsily bumped his table and toppled his cappuccino, and he was frantically napkin-dabbing his slacks when the comic materialized from the depths of her Burberry backpack. 

 

“I’m a fan of your work,” the woman assured him. Still, he waved her away. He’d been getting recognized often lately; it was annoying. 

 

“Get lost, you old bitch,” he grunted, taking no small measure of joy as he watched her face crumple into a downcast expression, one incongruous with the psychedelic shawl that she wore.

 

Through her tears and livid shaking, the old gal muttered, “No, no, you shouldn’t have. You shouldn’t…you shouldn’t have done it.”

 

“Your parents shouldn’t have spawned you, so go find a bridge to live under,” Bradley countered. “That’s right, I just called you a troll. What can *you* do about it? As a matter of fact, were it up to me, people like you wouldn’t be allowed to read my comics in the first place.”      

 

“People like me? *People like me?* You dare insult hoodooists?”

 

“Hoodooists? Is that what inbred hags call themselves nowadays?” 

 

“Inbred? *Inbred!* What the heck is your problem? I approached you politely, humbly requesting an autograph, and you went and treated me like week-old, diseased spittle. Someone…*somebody* needs to teach you a lesson!” 

 

“Lesson, huh? Talk about lessons after you graduate from kindergarten, ya empty-headed spastic. They should stick you on an island—or better yet, under one.” *Wow, I’m really laying into her, aren’t I?* Bradley thought, delighted. *What’s gotten into me today? Surely, spilled coffee alone can’t shape me into someone this sinister? Have I forgotten something I should be pissed-off about?*     

 

Seemingly shrinking two inches, the elderly lady flung her entire physicality into a quivering tirade, a finger-waving string of invectives. Mangling much conjugation, interspersing four-letter nastiness every five words or so, she explained that thing about voodoo (you know, from this story’s first paragraph).

 

“I have your self portrait!” she added. “You’re sure in for it, buddy!” To better illustrate her assertion, she opened Bradley’s comic and pointed out its protagonist in a succession of images. Bradley hadn’t just been *The Unspooling*’s creator, you see, he’d also been its star, having written the tale about his experiences as he wrote the tale. It was one of those meta sort of pieces, that certain types of people relate to. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley, those kinds of fans didn’t mesh well with him in public. Frankly, most looked as if they were about to sneeze on him—and sometimes did, for that matter. Often, they’d demand to take a photo with Bradley, even though he hated to be photographed, due to that wart on his cheek that resembled a nipple. Never were they voluptuous groupies, or even related to any.        

 

“Come on, lady,” groaned Bradley. “We both know that voodoo’s not real. You’re only degrading that issue’s value…when it was Very Fine to begin with, tops.”  

 

“I’m gonna curse you, boy! Curse you bad! A real bad curse! Then I’m gonna tell my online hoodooist group all about it! Best believe!”

 

“Online hoodooist group? *Online hoodooist group!* Lady, I thought those Sarah McLachlan animal cruelty videos were the saddest thing I ever saw. Then you came into my life. I tell ya, my soul weeps.” 

 

“Soul?” she yelped. “Soul, sir…your soul is, is…is curdled. In fact, say goodbye to your soul. It’s…muh-muh-mine.” 

 

*Yeah, she looks like she’s gonna sneeze, alright*, Bradley thought.

 

“Mine!” the woman shrieked, before thundering right out of the Starbucks. 

 

“Hers,” Bradley laughed, making his way to the counter to attain a coffee to go. He decided to throw away his slacks the very instant he got home, to better help him forget the encounter.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Naturally, forgetting the encounter wasn’t the coffee spiller’s intention. Matilda Grieves was her name. Fuming was her mentality, inundated by recollections of past insults, the sort that had shaped her into a hoodooist to begin with. 

 

Powering on her MacBook, she announced, “I’ll show him, yes, yes. I’ll make every second of every minute of his every day agonized. *The Unspooling* fooled me good. I actually thought Bradley-\*asshole-\*Clarke to be a kindred spirit. Never again, I say. Never, never. That snobby jerk thinks he’s so great. Well, I’ll show him, yes I will.” 

 

With her laptop’s built-in webcam, Matilda recorded a simple how-to video, which she immediately uploaded to her hoodooist group’s website. In the video, she used scissors to cut out a front profile illustration of Bradley Clarke, from *The Unspooling*’s seventh issue, and then a back profile illustration, from *The Unspooling* issue four, of roughly equivalent dimensions. She then traced both onto canvas, cut it carefully, and sewed everything together, stuffed with yarn. Just as simple as that, Bradley had been reproduced in effigy. 

 

In closing, Matilda snarled at the webcam and exhorted, “This comic book bastard mocked us, my sisters. He thinks we’re pathetic, a buncha inbred hags playin’ make-believe. So let’s teach him a lesson—all of us, together, today. Make voodoo dolls of your own, and we’ll hit Mr. Clarke with enough hexes to leave his doomed, bastard head spinnin’.”

 

As dozens of her web chums placed same-day delivery orders, or busily bustled their way to comic book dealers, Matilda took her Bradley doll for a spin. 

 

First, she made the thing do the splits. 

 

And lo and behold, in another part of the city, Bradley found himself plummeting painfully upon his testicles, legs pointed eastward and westward. Shrieking, he rolled onto his side, only to find his left foot flying into his face, over and over. “What’s happening?” he wailed. 

 

“It worked, I can feel it,” Matilda declared, alone in her bedroom. Frankly, the power she felt coursing through her body aroused her sexually. Fantasizing about rubbing the doll against her erogenous zones, she became flush-faced, and had to remind herself that she absolutely hated Bradley Clarke. 

 

Palpitating, she decided to take an especially lengthy cold shower. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

There are voodoo secrets unknown even to most hoodooists. Prime amongst them is the effect that multiple voodoo dolls have on their subject. I mean, how many people are deemed so reprehensible that they garner drastic measures from not just one, but multiple hexers? That percentage is so infinitesimal, it was previously unheard of. 

 

While Matilda showered, the first of her confrères completed her own Bradley doll. The very moment that she finished sewing the thing together, an astounding process commenced. Seated in his kitchen with an icepack on his scrotum, Bradley felt himself being tugged by an invisible force. “Ahhhh!” he hollered, gritting what felt like too many teeth, assailed by a splitting headache. 

 

*I’m exchanging stature for breadth*, he thought, shrinking and widening. Arms sprouted from his neck. His genitals doubled, as did his legs. His vision temporarily dilated, as he fell off of his chair while remaining seated. 

 

Due to an inexplicable binary fission, there were now two Bradley Clarkes, each half the size and weight of the original. Even his clothing—jeans and an Indian Jewelry shirt, the one with the drippy lips—had doubled and shrunk, though the ice pack remained singular. 

 

“What the hell is this?” both Bradleys asked, synchronized. Then, suddenly, the floored Bradley was slapping his own face with alternating palms, whilst the other Bradley watched, quite perplexed. And even as that occurred, flesh began to stream from both his self-slapping and seated selves. Amalgamating, it formed a third Bradley—the same size as those two, who had shrunken. 

 

Reclining, the new Bradley slid up the wall, then back down to the floor, then right back up the wall, even as his flesh streamed to help form a fourth Bradley. 

 

And that’s how it continued. Bradleys contributed mass to new Bradleys. Ceaselessly shrinking, they endured every painful calamity those distant hoodooists saw fit to send over. One’s leg twisted so severely that bone shards poked out in three places; another found himself blinded as both his eyes imploded. A few danced without rhythm, or leapt far higher than they ought to have. Soon, the kitchen was filled with Bradleys, which was when the deaths began. 

 

One Bradley went up in flames; another endured a waterless drowning. Four strangulated themselves purple-faced. A Bradley spun his head off his shoulders while dancing a jig. Another was crumpled into a ball hardly recognizable as human. Replicated shrieks filled the residence, which might have reached the ears of 911-dialing neighbors, were any home from work at the time.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Matilda’s hoodooist network was far larger than one might suspect, and the ratio of live Bradleys to dead ones kept increasing. In fact, the process soon prompted the most clandestine of voodoo secrets to manifest. 

 

You see, when a voodoo doll’s subject is shrunken smaller than their effigy, they effectively become their voodoo doll’s doll. Unseen, true musculature blossoms within canvas. Eyes of glossy, illustrated paper become fully functional. Faux fingers flex as functioning digits. 

 

Ergo, even as the hoodooists contorted and mangled their respective dolls, cackling, they were unaware that such actions no longer affected any Bradley. Indeed, abandoning their physicality, each Bradley now bided his time as a spirit existing inside his own effigy. 

 

Each would wait until their hexer was vulnerable—sleeping, reading, or otherwise distracted—and then they’d enact their revenge. They’d gather knifes, razors, knitting needles, and other sharp implements, and assail hoodooist flesh with all proper animus. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The original Bradley doll trudged toward a bathroom, wherein a showered Matilda was toweling herself dry. Awkwardly, he clutched a pair of scissors, which he’d discovered beneath her living room sofa. 

 

*I’ll give that old bitch her autograph after all*, he thought, grinning paper lips. *I’ll carve it in permanent, and see how she likes it.* ",2,1770137852.0,SpinalTapHorror,0,1.0,False
1quxcpf,https://i.redd.it/9udr77798bhg1.jpeg,"Tasted Devarkhan Estate once, now spiralling!","Hello fellow bean worshippers,

I recently visited Katha Coffee, Hyderabad and had the Devarkhan Estate pourover.

Absolutely phenomenal cup! clean, sweet, complex, the whole “pause mid-sip and stare into the void” experience. Naturally, my inner pourover gremlin kicked in and I asked the obvious question: “Can I buy these beans?”

And alas… Katha only sells their house espresso blend.

My V60, Origami and Cafec Deep 27 wept quietly.

So I turn to you, wise people of Reddit:

* Has anyone bought Devarkhan Estate beans?
* Which roaster/cafe sells them?
* Or do I need to befriend a plantation owner/bribe a barista/perform a ritual?

Any leads appreciated. 

My kettle is ready. My grinder is impatient. ☕️

It was annoying. Headache and tiredness. After work I could just lay down and slept more than normal (but also because I had a bad sleep the night before).
Today I was feeling pretty okay! Only slight headache but no tiredness. Feld almost good even. Maybe also because I slept a lot.
Still... I had my favorite caffeine drink after work. My brain tricked me. Told myself I can have it today before my workout and will cut again tomorrow.
It's crazy how strong the addiction is. I had no withdrawal symptoms yet still I craved it so much. I am frustrated about myself but also feel encouraged to try again, now that I know that it won't be that bad.
I bought some caffeine free lemonade and carbonated water to fight the craving for that drink tomorrow. Luckily I don't like coffee but I really enjoy that damn mate tea lemonade so much so I wonder if it's more of an addiction to the tasty drink than to caffeine? Not sure. One bottle equals one coffee so it's not even that strong (no energy drink) so maybe I'll be fine tomorrow.
Please can someone hold me accountable tomorrow? :D Or give me any tips in how to fight those stupid addiction thoughts that try to justify another caffeine drink? What to do against the cravings?",1,1770137797.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

- 15-20 minutes of waiting and talking, 
- 3k what they call easy paced run (6:15 per km)
- and then coffee and organized lunch if we opt in.

Now, I'm a relatively slow runner, I admit, and 3k is a short distance, but is 6:15 per km really considered easy paced?!? 
(just for info we are not in Kenya) 

I can do it but it's definitely not chill.
I would prefer like 5k-12k runs but so we can actually talk while we run. And not run just straight to the bar.

Is this usual and I'm being weak? Or they are trying to eliminate slow people and just have the ones that 6:15 is a easy paced?

No other free running clubs around to try ...

[**Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof Exhibition: Life of Service**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/jordan-abdur-raoof-exhibition-life-of-service/) at **Durham Visitor Information Center 🫶**

* Photographer Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof has transformed the Visitor Info Center to an ode to Durham hospitality. His exhibition, [Life is Service](https://www.lifeisservice.space/), highlights community, connection, and hospitality, showcasing people from beloved local businesses. Add a stop to the Visitor Info Center to check off a [Love Durham](https://www.discoverdurham.com/love-durham/) spot as part of the Creative Challenge!
* The Visitor Info Center is open every Tuesday-Saturday, 10am-5pm.
* Free
* Through Feb. 28

[**Hoopla**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/hoopla/) at **Golden Belt Artists**

* The bigger the hoops, the more influential the person. Taking up physical space has always been powerful— especially in a world where political space is limited. Internationally published artist Perrin Marie is creating a series of hoop skirts and accessories adorned with recycled materials that make noise— not always just a gentle swish swish, but the clink of bottles, the chime of cans, and a whole lot of presence. It's a fashionable revolution. Through this work, Perrin empowers individuals to take up space, skirt the issues, and make HOOPLA (get it?).
* Mid-Show Reception: February 20
* Closing Reception: March 20
* Through March 31
* Free

[**Winter**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/winter-at-5-points-gallery-members-exhibit/) at **5 Points Gallery**

* 5 Points Gallery is pleased to present Winter at 5 Points: Gallery Members Exhibit, bringing together new and recent works from the gallery’s member artists in a winter presentation shaped by distinct voices, materials, and ways of seeing. The exhibition moves from intuitive and outsider-influenced expressions to layered abstraction, imaginative figurative scenes, nature-inspired painting, fused glass work, and the refined craftsmanship of finely made furniture. Subtle threads of empowerment, heritage, connection to the natural world, and messages of peace and care for others emerge throughout, creating a sense of continuity across otherwise varied practices. Seen together, these works invite viewers to linger and experience the depth and richness of the artists’ creative worlds.
* Join in for the Third Friday Reception on January 16 from 6–9pm as part of Durham’s Third Friday Art Walk. Meet the artists and experience this seasonal exhibition.
* Visit 5 Points Gallery in person or online. All work from the exhibition is available for shipping or pickup. Gallery hours are Thursdays and Fridays 5–9pm and Saturdays 1–9pm. Artists are available to talk about their work.
* Free
* January 16-Feb 14

[**Art Exhibit — Dis/orient: Contemporary Art of the Asian Diaspora**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-dis-orient-contemporary-art-of-the-asian-diaspora/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* A focused exhibition that examines how artists of Asian descent confront long-standing stereotypes embedded in the word “Orient.” Rooted in Western imperialism, the term historically enforced a sense of distance and “otherness” that continues to shape cultural perceptions today. Dis/orient brings together artists who use humor, memory, tradition, and personal narrative to challenge this legacy and illuminate the richness and multiplicity of the Asian diaspora.
* “Dis/orient invites viewers to look beyond the flattened idea of a single ‘Orient’ and instead appreciate the complexity, humor, and emotional depth that define contemporary Asian diasporic art,” said Julianne Miao, curatorial associate at the Nasher Museum. “Each artist brings a distinct perspective, reminding us that identity is never monolithic. It is lived, questioned, and continually reshaped.”
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.

1qux5jz,https://i.redd.it/11vwmwla7bhg1.jpeg,Alternative for discontinued Depositing Conditioner?,"Hi

My partner's go-to colour conditioner for covering their greys has been discontinued. We used to get it on offer for about £8/250ml (~$11). Is there a brand that anyone can recommend for similar or even (slightly) better coverage at the same price point?

Semi permanent dye may also be an option but they don't want to darker their existing brown hair noticeably, just cover the greys subtly.

Complete rewrite of the expression evaluator, should have a very visible impact on debugger performance while single stepping and refreshing variables. Also means that conditional breakpoints will evaluate faster, which is always a good thing.

1qux5e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1qux5e4/here_are_some_of_my_little_known_hacks_for_being/,Here are some of my little known hacks for being a naturally charming person!,"# 1. Slow your reactions by half a beat

Charming people don’t rush to respond. That tiny pause before you speak signals calm confidence and real attention.

It feels like:

* You’re actually thinking, not waiting to talk
* You’re grounded
* You’re not trying to impress

Try it especially after someone says something personal.



# 2. Treat small details like they matter

Remembering *how* someone takes their coffee, the dog’s name, or the weird hobby they mentioned once does more than remembering big facts.

The trick: **repeat details out loud once** when you first hear them. It locks them in and makes the person feel acknowledged instantly.



# 3. Be warm first, clever second

Many people try to be interesting before being kind. That backfires.

Charm works better when:

* Your tone is welcoming
* Your face relaxes before your mouth opens
* Your humor never costs someone else dignity

You can be sharp later. Safety comes first.



# 4. React emotionally before logically

When someone tells a story, don’t lead with analysis or advice.

Lead with:

* “That must’ve been frustrating.”
* “That’s exciting.”
* “I can see why that stuck with you.”

People remember how you *felt with them*, not what you solved.



# 5. Ask follow-ups that aren’t obvious

Instead of:

* “How long have you been doing that?”
* “Do you like it?”

Try:

* “What surprised you most about it?”
* “What part do people usually misunderstand?”
* “When did it start feeling real?”

These questions feel intimate without being invasive.



# 6. Let your enthusiasm show a little more than feels safe

Most people dampen their reactions to avoid looking eager.

Charming people do the opposite:

* They smile fully.
* They say “That’s cool” and mean it.
* They let interest be visible.

Warmth reads as confidence, not neediness.



# 7. Lower your voice at the end of sentences

Ending sentences slightly softer (not quieter, just less sharp) makes you sound composed and approachable.

It subconsciously signals:

* You’re not seeking approval
* You’re comfortable with silence
* You’re present

This works especially well when meeting someone new.



# 8. Share tiny imperfections casually

Not trauma. Not self-deprecation marathons.

Just things like:

* “I always get lost here.”
* “I’m weirdly bad at remembering names.”
* “I overthink emails.”

It humanizes you without asking for reassurance.



# 9. Make exits graceful, not abrupt

Instead of disappearing, say:

* “I’m really glad we talked.”
* “Let’s pick this up another time.”
* “Enjoy the rest of your night.”

People remember the *ending* more than the middle.



# 10. Assume people like you unless proven otherwise

This is the quiet superpower.

When you expect acceptance:

* Your body relaxes
* Your humor lands better
* Your listening improves

People often mirror the way you treat yourself.",5,1770137387.0,socialskills,2,0.62,False
1qux4s7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qux4s7,My Experience With Hekate,"Hey everyone. I wanted to share my experience over the last year and a half, because it's been... a lot. I'm still processing, and I'd love to hear if any of this resonates.

About 18 months ago, I was at the lowest point in my life. Deeply depressed, lost about my future, and completely atheist. The concept of a punishing, jealous ""God"" never sat right with me. I felt spiritually empty.

Then, the signs started. Subtly at first.

· Spiders: I've had major arachnophobia my whole life, but I started noticing them everywhere. I'd walk into a room and just feel one was there. The fear turned into a weird fascination.
· Crows: They began appearing more frequently in my daily routes. Not flocks, but deliberate, noticeable presences.
· Snakes: An old interest (I even have a snake tattoo) came roaring back.

I started wondering if there were other spiritual paths—ones based on respect, not fear. I stumbled upon Hellenic paganism, and the name Hekate instantly electrified me. I researched, and one night, with no altar, I just... prayed.

The next morning, I woke up saying the word ""crossroads"" out loud—something I never do in my sleep. I took it as a sign. I grabbed some garlic, went to a crossroads near my house, left the offering, and prayed.

The synchronicities exploded that same day.

My aunt, visiting out of the blue, insisted on reading my coffee grounds. She said, ""Someone is watching over you. You're going to light a candle on a table, and a key to a door you kept closed will open."" I was stunned—I had just been thinking of setting up a discreet altar. Later, I asked my grandmother for an old key. She handed me one stamped with three interlocking circles, a symbol I now know is deeply connected to Hekate.

That was my ""okay, this is real"" moment.

I set up a small, hidden altar (my family is very religious). I began meditating, lighting a candle, and praying. My whole life, I've been sensitive to energies—feeling shifts as heavy, light, warm, or cold. I started sensing a heavy, negative energy in one part of my house.

Without many resources, I read about protection with rosemary. Going outside at night to get some, I found three snails forming a perfect circle. That week, I dreamt of pitch darkness, then a cave with glowing yellow/white eyes watching me.

Then, life got busy. Exams hit, and I dove into Buddhist philosophy. The doubt crept in: Was this all spiritual psychosis? I stopped my practice for two months.

But the signs didn't stop. Crows were constant. A tawny owl flew right over my head. One night, walking home scared from uni, an owl hooted beside me and continued, like an escort, until I reached my door.

I took it as a nudge. I bought my first tarot deck and began learning, leaning heavily on intuition.

But the heavy energy in my house lingered, and doubt came back hard. What if it wasn't Hekate at all? I spiraled, researching The Morrigan, Lilith, asking Reddit.

One night, in total confusion, I did a tarot reading asking for clarity on the deity reaching out. I pulled the 2 of Cups (union, mutual respect). I asked point-blank if it was Hekate, The Morrigan, or another. I pulled the High Priestess, but the energy that hit me was pure, frustrated intensity, like, ""Figure it out yourself. Get it together."" It was so strong it creeped me out.

Still doubting, but leaning on my first instinct, I offered garlic at the crossroads again. That night, on my roof facing the crossroads, I prayed for a clear head. Immediately, I felt a powerful energy and the distinct sensation of eyes watching me from the crossroads.

I went straight to my altar, offered garlic and water, lit the candle, and prayed for guidance. The candle flame began ""glitching"", growing huge, then snapping back to normal, over and over.

I knew. I addressed the deity directly. I said, ""I'm sure it's you, Hekate. I'm sorry for my doubt. I have the utmost respect for you.""

The candle went wild again. I felt compelled to pull cards.

The message was clear: I needed to address my fears. I voiced my terror of ""spiritual psychosis,"" and pulled 7 of Wands (reversed), 8 of Wands, and the 2 of Cups again. The interpretation washed over me: my fears were blocking me (7W Rx), I needed to move forward bravely and quickly (8W), and yes, this was a relationship of mutual respect (2C).

A deep, immediate peace settled over me. I promised to be open to signs and to learn more. The candle calmed to a steady, strong flame, a definite ""yes.""

The final, almost laughable sign came the next day. I installed a new game, and the auto-generated name suggestion was, well, let's just say it was another undeniable nod to her.

I'm sharing this because I spent so long doubting my own senses. If you're on a similar path, wrestling with doubt and incredible signs, you're not alone. Sometimes the road is dark, but there are torches (and owls, crows, and strangely specific keys) lighting the way.

Has anyone else had such a persistent, dramatic calling? How did you navigate the doubt?",6,1770137348.0,Hekate101,3,1.0,False

I’ve been hunting for some 'Daily Gold' Those pieces you can actually wear to the office or a coffee run without looking like you’re headed to a wedding?

I was browsing Tanishq and found these two lightweight pieces that are perfect for a daily rotation. I’ll be honest, I always assumed the 'real' investment gold was just the heavy 916 hallmark sets my mom keeps in the locker, but these actually have the BIS hallmark logo stamped right on them.

Now I’m stuck in a scroll-hole and need a tie-breaker. Which vibe should I go with?

Option 1 (The Heart): Is this classic V-Day cute or am I overthinking it? It’s giving very 'Emily in Paris' romantic vibes, but I want to make sure it still feels sophisticated for work.

Option 2 (The Abstract Curve): This is definitely for the 'Clean Girl' / Corporate aesthetic. I feel like this would be so much easier to layer with my other chains?

1qux3tp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qux3tp/is_there_anything_i_can_do_to_get_my_ex_boyfriend/,Is there anything I can do to get my ex boyfriend back? I am so heartbroken.,"Hi everyone, hoping for some advice on a breakup that happened a week ago today. It’s kind of complicated and I’m absolutely heartbroken so apologies for the length of this post, or if it’s not the right place for it. Oh and I’m very aware it all sounds a bit teenage at my big age! 

I (33F) met my now ex boyfriend (30M) on a dating app last February. I had just moved back in with my mum after living away for years, as she had terminal brain cancer and lives alone. My mum was given weeks to live in May last year, and I cared for her at home, but she is in hospice now, likely to die in a few weeks. My boyfriend was supportive throughout all this - my bouts of crying, panic, carers visiting the house endlessly, hospice visits etc and was really my rock. He was kinder and more patient than anyone I’ve ever met. I kept saying he could walk away anytime and he didn’t - I thought we would be together forever if we could get through this situation right at the start of our relationship, and was amazed that he was sticking by me. I worked really hard to keep the relationship as fun and light as possible, and make him feel special as much as I could. Although over time I was able to be more vulnerable and open about things which was probably tedious and depressing for him to listen to. I had been single for years and my dream above everything else was to meet someone like him. 

Towards the end of last year he was really keen to discuss moving in, wedding, kids etc - conversations that I found exciting, but difficult and was unsure about, given that my mum would be dead by that point, and I am so scared about what grief will do to me/if he will still want to be with me. Plus, he wanted me to move to an area far away from my friends and family, and wouldn’t compromise. I tried to communicate this all to him, and I thought he got it, but he did bring it up a lot which started to stress me out as my mum got sicker around the Christmas period. I maybe came across as unsure or annoyed about things, but really it was fear. Ugh.

Anyway, there were about 2-3 occasions over the past four weeks where I let total unbridled panic and terror about my mum dying and my future take over me. I was so so angry at the world, I shouted at him horribly and was truly awful - I got even more wound up because he didn’t really react at all - I ended up asking him to leave my house on one occasion. I think I just desperately wanted reassurance and went about it in 100% the wrong way. It was terrible of me and I regret it so deeply. I let anticipatory grief build up and lashed out. Long story short, we had a phone call on a Saturday night about two weeks ago which he took as us breaking up (I thought surely not, that we would need to talk in person). I was sick to my stomach and distraught all Sunday, and on Monday messaged him taking full accountability for my behaviour, apologising and explaining that I would be restarting counselling and taking various other steps to prevent me from behaving that way again. He said he was happy to hear from me but unsure about things and his head was scrambled (fair enough). I continued to apologise profusely via text. On Wednesday we had a phone call where we decided to get back together and we spent a nice weekend together. So overall we were broken up from Saturday night-Wednesday. 

The following Monday, after our nice weekend (although I thought he seemed a bit quiet, I understood it would take time to go back to normal) I saw on social media that he had been on a dating app that following week (updated with photos I had taken him of on holiday, which was such a gut punch) and I was stunned. There was only two days we hadn’t spoken that previous week and I couldn’t believe he had felt so ready to go on the apps. I let him know I had seen this saying that it didn’t feel great and that I didn’t realise he had done that. He was really off and quite defensive about it. Just saying one word answers along the lines of ‘oh my god, I obvs deleted it when we got back together’. Fine, people have knee jerk reactions like that and swipe for validation. I then brought it up again on Tuesday after he stopped speaking to me that Monday, to ask how far things had gone on the app, and he said he had been out for coffee with one girl, which I hadn’t realised - I wanted to throw up. He said that was on Sunday (the day after our break up call) or Tuesday, he couldn’t remember. I thought that was very quick to arrange a date (suspicious that he maybe had downloaded the app before we broke up) and said how much it hurt me that he hadn’t told me any of this. He doubled down and said he hadn’t done anything wrong, we had broken up at that point, he couldn’t remember when he had downloaded the app - it was like a different person. Anyway, he ended it that day it via text saying basically we should go our separate ways, he didn’t want any drama, wished me happiness and to “take care”. Like we hardly knew each other - it seemed so formal and cold. I initially sent back a kind of angry message saying he had really hurt me, and that going on a date with somebody the day after we broke up via phone just made it look like the relationship didn’t mean anything to him etc, and then followed it up by saying thank you for everything and that I was so sorry it hadn’t worked out and I had really loved him. He just liked the message. This was all last Tuesday - sorry, this must be so confusing to read! 

So obviously he will have been on many dates a week on, and he is an unemotional person (like he’s just always just feeling fine and happy) - so he will have just closed our chapter and won’t have been thinking about me at all and is always busy with his work. Do you think there is anything I can say to get him back? I know it was mostly my own fault, and I have sobbed and sobbed for days, been unable to eat or sleep, and feel like I have no future. I know I was horrible to him but I did everything I could to apologise and take actions to ensure I don’t lash out again. I think if I text him he will either block me or send me another cold message saying to please leave him alone and that he’s moved on, but I just can’t let this go. I thought we would get through this terrible patch and have a future together and I am devastated. He was saying two weeks ago about going to come to my mum’s funeral with me. I just can’t believe that I have ruined everything by letting my emotions take over on those handful of occasions and I will never forgive myself. If you read all that, wow, thank you and any advice is welcome - I already know it is own wrongdoing that set this all in motion. I hate myself for this and am terrified that at my age, and the grief that will hit me soon, I will never meet anyone or have children as I won’t be a position to date.

I’ve taken a few of these before. From most to least, Shilajit, black ginger, cistanche. Shilajit being something that I can’t usually tell if there’s any acute effects, I know it’s works in the background. Black ginger does everything It says it does. Only thing is I think I get eye twitches sometimes from it. Cistanche i remember having positive experience but I didn’t take it long enough. I’m not sure if it’s “outdated” since Cistamax came out, I may use up this bottle and switch to that. I’m curious to hear if there’s noticeable improvements between the two. Never taken EurycoMax. 

I bought Beta Ec maybe a year ago, this one I’m not certain if I wanna add or not. The best way I put it, I wanna depend on the least amount of things as possible. I’m curious if there’s a noticeable % of improvement observed while on it. 

Things I’d like to add on to  

	•	recovery 

	•	Gain muscle 

	•	Improve gym performance 

	•	Continue to get stronger

I’m in my 30s and I keep experiencing the same pattern. I don’t wanna see myself as a victim, I want to find out why it keeps happening to me so I can avoid it.

I matched with someone on a dating app for women/NB and we talked for a few weeks. Im not from their country but often visit and we were planning to meet. They asked if I wanna put a date in the calendar in advance so I said sure and we chose a day. They love animals so I asked if they would like to go to this cafe where you can pet dogs and they said “I would LOVE that!” The plan was to go for a coffee first so they could tell me about their vacation because they are on their first solo trip and then we would go to the dog place. So I booked it and sent them a little itinerary and they kept saying how much they look forward and how happy they are I planned everything because usually it’s them organizing things for others. In the itinerary I put my number so we could get in touch if something changes but I never asked for their number or put any pressure. I just asked if something changes to let me know so I could cancel it. They messaged on whatsapp right away to share their number. We talked a bit more and then they went to bed and said they would talk to me tomorrow. This was two days ago and my last message is still unopened. They are active on social media. They’ve never done this before since we started talking.

Can someone explain why people do this? Is this normal and I’m just weird? I’m very careful with boundaries and never push anyone but I keep experiencing this over and over that someone acts happy to meet me and then they ghost (not just on dating apps). Often these people approach me first to ask if I wanna meet and when I agree they ghost. Sometimes they ghost for hours or days and then they come back as if nothing happened but during the ghosting they always post on instagram. We are talking people in their 30s-40s. They have one thing in common: they like to share posts about the need of community or how shitty it is to be left on delivered for hours.

Am I weird that this seems like a shitty behaviour to me? I wouldnt mind if they messaged “sorry Im busy but we’ll talk later”. But not opening my message and going quiet with no explanation

seems rude right after we planned the date, especially when we talked regularly before.",1,1770137113.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False
