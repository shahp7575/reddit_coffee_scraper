1pmx3jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/1pmx3jd/sugarfree_redbull_is_healthier_compared_to_coffee/,"(sugarfree) RedBull is healthier compared to coffee, yet people think you're gonna have a heart attack","DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A DOCTOR

Redbull has 80 mg of caffeine per 8.6 oz aka 9.3 mg per oz

Coffee has 11.6 to 17mg of caffeine per oz

RedBull has taurine, which is known to have various health benefits, including increasing life span, muscle growth, and heart health. Coffee does not.

So why do people have this stigma about redbull?

1. Coffee is more widely accepted, and has been around longer

2. Cases of redbull causing heart attacks are blown out of proportion. You shouldn't have 12 redbulls, nor should you have 12 cups of coffee. Common sense and moderation is key.

Also, if you drink normal redbull, consider switching to sugar free as to avoid sugar crash :)

i've tried sensodyne, crest, and colgate optic white over the past couple months but haven't seen much difference. some made my teeth kinda sensitive too which wasn't great. i'm spending like $8-10 per tube and starting to feel like its all just marketing.

not trying to get crazy white teeth or anything, just want to get back to normal. i've seen the charcoal ones and those expensive $15 tubes but dont know if they're worth it or just hype.

what's actually the best whitening toothpaste you've used that showed real results? how long before you noticed anything? and did you have sensitivity problems?

really appreciate any honest advice, tired of wasting money on stuff that doesn't work!",1,1765768659.0,hygiene,0,1.0,False

I know wfh is a blessing and the flexibility is extremely valuable but I also have been really, really struggling being cooped up at home. I try coffee shops and coworking spaces but between meetings and errands and chauffeuring kids neither of them make much sense. My husband and I both work in our small townhome and being in such close quarters for so long has not been good for our marriage. 

The one thing I was looking forward to was the holiday party at work. I have been killing it at my job, just got promoted to the head of my department, AND I have a reputation for being an amazing baker. People have been asking my direct report every day when I’ll be back and if I’m bringing cookies for the holiday party. For the holiday season I’ve spent the past literal month planning, prepping, baking for 9 different types of cookies for an impressive assortment. My goal was to make 1000 cookies by Christmas Eve. 

It’s Sunday night and we just found the spots on my toddlers hands. The daycare told us 4 days ago there was a confirmed case in the classroom. She has no other symptoms at all but it’s unmistakably HFMD. 

Fuck this. I wish I could stop crying over this holiday party. But I’m so fucking heartbroken.  I planned my outfit, including shoes and earrings. I found beautiful vintage cookie tins from the antiques fair and planned how many of each cookie I would bring and how I would lay them out.

1pmx0m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1pmx0m0/gre_second_attempt_160v_163q/,GRE second attempt: 160v 163q,"I’ve been loving seeing all of the actual geniuses on here posting their highly impressive scores, but I’m posting this for the rest of us mere mortals. I started studying for the GRE towards the end of August and wish I would’ve optimized my studying earlier. But hey we don’t know what we don’t know, so hopefully people will be able to get some value out of this. 

My background: Cybersecurity undergrad from an online school, I haven’t done anything math related in years. I’m not smart but I try hard. I forget what my exact score was for my first ETS practice test was but it was something heinous like 145v/150q. I’m fortunate to be able to study up to 12 hours a day since I’m not working at the moment, but I definitely wasted time early on studying the wrong things. I only used the ETS power pack books up until my first GRE attempt in mid October which was 153v/159q. After that I decided to get my shit together and became willing to try anything to get me a higher score. I enrolled in Gregmat with prepswift and found it very valuable because of all the videos where he’ll break down all of the problems from quizzes. For the price you can’t beat it. It’s not perfect though, it can be glitchy for example if you fat finger while using the calculator on a practice test it will just crash and you’ll start from the beginning without saving any of your work. It’s pretty annoying but hey for $12 a month or whatever it is I was impressed. 

A couple other things I did early on was vocabulary podcasts. Nick Nordstrom has a great series on Spotify for GRE words that is awesome to listen to when you’re driving but still want to be engaged. Once I started using Gregmat though I started playing their vocab lists in the car to try to be as productive as I could be. Additionally I downloaded this vocabulary app so that I would get new words on my phone lock screen. 

I also hired a tutor around the beginning of November. Ed is the man! He’s affordable and he was very good at steering me in the right direction. I foolishly put my phone number on varsity’s website, and ended up getting spammed relentlessly by them for a few weeks. I haven’t heard great things about them, and they’re expensive. I ended up using the manhattan 5 pound book as well, their building block approach was very helpful for me. About two weeks before my second attempt I ended up taking just about every free practice test out there: the ETS one, Manhattan, Princeton review, Kaplan, all three of Gregmats, and then I paid for another ETS one two days before my exam. 

Additionally I started taking functional mushrooms every day. Ive been using lions mane extract daily with coffee and it’s been a game changer. I suffered a brain injury last summer so my focus was decently impaired. The week before the test I added cordyceps and alpha brain. Along with 10mg of creatine daily. They could be placebos but I feel like they helped. Effective placebos nonetheless. 

I would definitely leave more time to study than you think you’ll need. Once you unlock the hard version of verbal and quant for the latter sections you’ll notice that those questions are unlike anything you’ve probably been preparing with. As Ed puts it, it just takes time to practice with questions in a low oxygen environment. I didn’t get the hard second section portions for the first time on practice tests until about two weeks ago. 

I’m planning on taking it one more time right before the R2 deadline, but will have to shift my focus to applications now. Getting this score is a relief, but I think I can do better. If you are like me and was discouraged early on don’t be, I think just dialing in how you study is more important than how much you study. The GRE is very much a critical thinking test, and developing a personal testing strategy is crucial to doing well imo. Again, this is targeted to us mere mortals and not all the demigods on here ;) best of luck!!!!!",1,1765768474.0,GRE,0,1.0,False

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:

I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is; the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other. I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere)
* 23–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:

You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip.

I'm currently completing a Graduate certificate in advanced marketing (courses are in the evening, so I am fully available to work during the day), and I've been applying to over 100 jobs and don't ever hear anything back....or just keep on getting rejection emails...

I've even tried applying to minimum wage jobs in calling centers, and it seems like I am getting denied, probably because they see I'm overqualified...

I'm so unmotivated, I'm heartbroken from the job market, and from all the emails of rejection I keep getting...

I'm in desperate need of work, but I don't want to work in retail or a minimum wage crappy job at McDonald's type thing...I really can't do that. My ego can't handle it. And also I want to work in a job where I will learn new skills, grow, and develop corporate knowledge...I don't want to just work in a coffee shop or retail store...

I'm so damn hurt... </3

Gear up. Off to the gas station for coffee and smokes. The women in there were very kind. The wind, not so much. Hung out for half an hour. Saw traffic picking up so I headed for the ramp.

Gear down. Thumb out. The last of my coffee in hand. 

Maybe half an hour later a young, super skinny woman stopped. ""Where ya headed?"" ""South down the 81."" ""I'm going to Harrisonburg."" ""That'd be awesome!"" ""Hop in.""

Gear in. Me in. Introduce myself. Brief chit-chat. She's got a lead foot. I don't think the term 'speed limit' was in her vocabulary. She drove safe. But fast.

She dropped me at sheetz about five miles north of town. I give her my heartfelt thanks and head inside. 

Phone charging. Breakfast bagel secured. I know the temperature is supposed to drop all day. It never got any warmer than when I woke up. I check the weather. It's cold and getting colder. I'm hoping to make it far south out of this cold today...

Phone in pocket. Charger in pack. Gear up. Out to the ramp. Gear down. Thumb out. 

It's fuckin' cold!!! The wind is gusting to thirty degrees. Coming from the north. I've got hand warmers in my shoes and my gloves. I'm rotating in the sun trying to keep warm. It's not happening. 'All part of the ride' I tell myself with a smile.

Some waves. Lots of confused stares. One hour. Two hours. 'Fuck it's cold.' 'Hey wind, that's enough!' Steady temperature drop.

I decide to go pretty far down the ramp to get some trees between me and the wind. It helps a little, but not much.

Three hours. I can't feel my hands. My legs are frozen. It's going from bad to worse quick. 

Four hours in... 'Fuck this. No sense being stupid. I'm out.' Gear up. I walk past sheetz to Pilot.

Inside. Find the truckers lounge. Not much of one, but there's seats, and I can charge my phone.

And it's warm!

Check weather. The 'feels like' is gonna be zero degrees in the valleys. Minus ten on the ridges. I have more appropriate gear than I had last winter, but I'm definitely not setup for this.

Throw a post on reddit looking to see if anyone's got a spot I can crash in the area. I get a message pretty quick. ""I can sort you out. If you're close we can meet in person."" ""I'm at the pilot north of town."" ""Bet. I'll sort you out. Take your post down so they don't ban you.""

I'm not begging for money. I'm just looking for a place to crash, so I leave it up. Also, I've been around the block a few times. I don't believe anything someone tells me until it happens.

An hour goes by. 'No worries. Dude probably has stuff to do. Can't expect someone to rearrange their life in a few minutes.' 

Half an hour later, still nothing. Another kind redditor comments he can get me a room. ""Let's hold off and see if this other guy comes through. I'll get a hold of you if it falls through...""

I send a message to person number one. Wait about half an hour. Radio silence.

I get back to the other guy with some details. Boom! Room booked. My profuse thanks. Get my route on maps. Gear up. Out the door.

The sun has set. It's getting dark. There's nowhere to walk on this road. There's no street lights. I'm out in the country. I've got 4.2 miles to walk. The wind is howling! 

About three-qurters of the way there I stop to rest. Take a drink of water.

My water jug is frozen inside and out. The cap is frozen shut. I break it lose, bang on the jug. Get a much needed drink. On down the road...

Cut through Lowe's. Down the final stretch. I'm sweating lightly and freezing at the same time. I can't feel my ears. 'Is that ice in my mustache?'

I know better than to go from full hike mode directly into a warm building. I need a cigarette. 

I see the hotel. 'Ah, the promised land!' I stop off to the side of the door. Well deserved smoke lit. 'That's better.' 

Finish smoke. Gear is still on. Inside. Drop pack near a couch. Start peeling off layers.

""Were you a boy scout?"" It's the woman at the front desk. I laugh. ""Yeah I was. A long time ago though."" ""I knew it! My boyfriend was a boy scout. He told me about the layers."" 

I start to give her my info. She's already on it. ""I just need to run his card for incidentals... It just declined."" She starts listing the usual options. I've got my debit card, but that will definitely decline. There's a dollar and change on there.

I message dude. We wait. I tried calling my brother to see if he might put his card down. No answer.

The front desk girl tries everything. Running the card again. Calls. Sends an email. She was super helpful, and very gracious about it. I couldn't ask for a better person to deal with. 

After a while she tells me I can hang out as long as I need. The overnight person is cool too. I'm in good hands.

Get a message. ""I'm on hold with them right now."" Such a feeling of relief! I walk over to the desk. She double checks to make sure the card goes through...

All is good! I'm stoked! I thank dude. I thank her for all of her help. Grab a luggage cart. Toss pack on. Into the elevator. Upstairs. (Top floor no less. Thanks man!!!) Down the hall. Key opens the door...

Aaaawww yeeeaaaah!!!

It had a deep, comforting bitterness with a rich body and a satisfyingly clean finish. The pudding was a revelation. Presented in a beautiful cut-glass dish, it was firm yet incredibly rich and dense. The texture was uniquely thick, kinda chewy, and creamy, almost like a dense custard, unlike the smoother puddings often found. The ample, dark caramel sauce added another sweet layer, providing a wonderful counterpoint to the deep, eggy sweetness of the pudding itself.

1pmwhb6,https://i.redd.it/v18uonva7a7g1.jpeg,Review #6 | Penelope Valencia,"**Bottle: Penelope Valencia (Batch 03)**

**Taken:** Neat in a Glencairn, rested for 10 minutes.

**Proof:** 95

**Thoughts:** This is a 74% Corn, 16% wheat, 7% Rye, and 3% Malted barley mash bill from MGP aged at least 4 years and finished for at least 12 months in a Vino de Naranja wine cask from Spain. This bottle is part of the Cooper series from Penelope where their bourbon is finished in casks from different cooperages from around the world. Vino de Naranja is a traditional white wine from Spain steeped with orange peels lending to a citrus forward pour. (right up my alley)

**Appearance:** In the darker corner of my room, it’s dark and rusty, but in the light, it’s a vibrant, orange marmalade color. For 95 proof, the legs are longer and more viscous than expected.

**Nose:** In a similar vein, the nose on this 95 proofer is more complex and robust than expected. I of course get citrus and orange, but without any of the wine notes shining through. This is a big plus for me as wine notes are not generally my favorite. Heavy vanilla was one of the first notes I detected on the nose, but as the pour opened up, that evolved into a fresh baked pastry note. Like the high end, good kind. It’s sugary.

**Palate:** The palate for me is the biggest let down on this pour. I don’t find it overly complex or interesting. I mainly pick up a ying and a yang – some traditional sweet bourbon notes mixed with the bitterness of the orange peel that is quite prominent (as expected) in this pour.

**Finish:** My first thought on the finish was a sweet, cakey, citrus pastry. I can’t say I’ve ever had a dessert that tasted like this finish, but it actually left me craving that recipe. What’s funny is that when I looked up some of the info on the mash bill and age statement from the Penelope website, their tasting notes have “iced coffee cake with blood orange glaze” as the note for the nose. While I’m thrilled that my novice palette picked this up, I detect it more strongly on the finish.

**Score: 7.49 / 10 (Great):** Despite the weak palate, this bourbon just has something about it that makes me want to keep coming back to it. Its easy, beautiful, and complex on the nose. Just how you would like a women to be on the eye. The bottle is good looking, and the finish is very enjoyable – my favorite part of the sip. And I think that’s exactly it. The finish is so lovely and so full of flavor despite the 95 proof point. I don’t find it watered down at all. The finish makes you keep wanting to go back to it. MSRP around 89 bucks, probably a bit more than id like to pay and one of the reasons I couldn’t go above a 7.5. I was lucky enough to get mine closer to 65 bucks from a buddy of mine. I would highly recommend giving this a try.

1pmwg81,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmwg81,"CHIUnE (Tokyo, Japan)","I didn’t take many photos because the person I was with was taking them, but I also don’t want to post his photos in case it was rude to share before asking.

Anyway, CHIUnE was one of my favorite restaurants when it opened but I could never get back in as I was still in high school / college n didn’t have control of my own schedule of when I was going back to Japan. Fast forward to a very nice person who was looking for a person to join them for a meal here off of Foodiesprime and I ended up booking a trip to Japan instead of my original Hayato reservation (ended up meeting some Hayato regulars who mentioned Rainier was in Japan too funnily enough). 

Having not been since the move, I was intensely excited as CHIUnE was maybe one of the greatest restaurants I’d been to all those years ago. I’ve got to say this lived up to my previous experience - my dining partner mentioned it may be better to come in spring but I’ve got to say I loved every moment of my meal.

I think Satoshi is a genius and I’m only more motivated to now try and visit Yamazaki next trip.

Courses were:

1. Tennen hotate capellini, intensity refined every bite was an exercise in perfect seasoning. There’s a risk doing such simple food feels cheap or shallow but every bite came through with the quality I was expecting from the past

2. White truffle consomme, stratospheric - the truffles themselves gave their aroma perfectly to the consomme and taste was sublime. Better than what had been my previous favorite consomme before my first visit, the beef consomme at kawamura

3. Shiitake, egg yolk and yamaimo purée - the bites with the shiitake and yamaimo continue to be some of my favorite things ever. The yolk is a perfect addition after I’ve also savoured the original taste of just the shiitake and yamaimo

4. Fried lily bulb with some being topped with shisho, atop rice. Excellent, I didn’t love it at first but the bites with the shisho leaves really just put this over the top 

5. Seikogani chawanmushi, intense but delicious. Kurosaki’s echizengani chawanmushi was still lingering in my mind from lunch that day but this was just underneath it. The chawans this trio were just so insane at the places that did good ones

6. The Daikon, one side cooked and finished either a bit more salt. Always an extremely fun progression - the final bites displaying a perfect level of salinity 

7. Torafugu karaage atop a bed of leeks, insane. I loved this a lot - the breading was maybe the best seasoned breading I’ve ever had and the meat was cooked perfectly. I didn’t get fugu the whole trip and then I had it at Kurosaki (excellent) and here - I even got the nikogori I love

8. The jikasei Kurobuta chorizo and shaved mushroom atop the eggplant purée. I fucking hate eggplant and I loved this dish, there’s really not much to say - just executed so well. I’d not had it before but had seen it become a staple on the menu in the time I couldn’t come again. It was great to finally try it again

9. Gifu duck with a namenko mushroom purée and duck jus, excellent - one of the best duck dishes ever. There’s very few that compare to this 

10. The Kurobuta pork, grilled in that sauce. Great, this was like the one thing I remember being a little improved in the past

11. Matsubagani gohan, a great final savoury. With this I think I ended up meeting my big winter crab goals for this trip which was super fun 

12. Shaoxing ice cream, perfect temp’d - it’s odd to call the dessert of a meal in which I loved almost everything the best course but I think I have to. I don’t think I’ve had a better ice cream before, full stop. Maybe the homemade coffee liquor ones I made myself? But that’s a preference thing - everyone loved this and I’m no exception

CHIUnE is one of my favorite restaurants ever and I’m so glad to have been able to go back and have it live up to everything I remembered. Satoshi ended up following me and it was just such a great experience overall - I’m definitely coming back.

1pmwah2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1pmwah2/how_i_finally_cleared_sibo/,How I Finally Cleared SIBO,"Stop what you’re doing and do a stool test and upload it to AI. Over 2 years and 11 months I had tried everything. I even did an elemental diet for two weeks, a lot of xifaxin, went to the best motility doctors, and tried all the motility medications.

December 2024

I did a Biomesight test. When I got the results back a few weeks later, I felt overwhelmed and defeated and did not take any action on it.

March 2025

One night, I uploaded the full 40-page Biomesight report into ChatGPT, asked it to be a world renowned functional medicine doctor, and started really digging into it. I was in the 100th Percentile for Bilophila wadsworthia and 97th percentile for H2S (breakdown of AI comparison is below)

A few weeks later I started with the recommendations. Nothing had ever worked for I did it and did not expect anything. If I had been expecting it to work I think it probably wouldn’t have. I had dabbled in all the supplements before Antrantil etc.

May to June 2025

I began feeling noticeably better and was able to stop doing colonics. Stopped going on SIBO Reddit in early June.

June to July 2025

I was eating homemade blueberry sorbet with Greek yogurt and felt amazing - a whole bag of frozen blueberries and several scoops of Greek yogurt. I still went easy on salads because I was afraid of them, but I was consistently eating cooked vegetables and Greek yogurt.

July to October 2025

I had no SIBO symptoms during this period. However, I had to take several rounds of antibiotics for a Ureaplasma infection. Sometimes it was one to two rounds per month, occasionally back to back or even multiple rounds in a row.

November 2025

I took doxycycline again for Ureaplasma. I had taken it earlier in the summer without issues, but after so many antibiotics overall, my symptoms started to return. Because the symptoms felt so similar to SIBO, I ordered another Biomesight test, convinced it was back.

December 2025

The results came in. Despite the symptoms feeling very much like SIBO, the test showed that I had actually cleared it. Instead, I was dealing with a different underlying issue, which was surprising and a result of antibiotics killing off certain bacteria and another bacteria growing (not SIBO).

⸻

Here’s the analysis of my Biomesight test that led me to treat the SIBO.

1. Bilophila wadsworthia (The Main Culprit)

This percentile ranking compares you to everyone else tested. A higher percentile here is bad (it means you have more of the pathogen than other people).

• December 2024 (Before): 100th Percentile 

• What this means: You were literally ""off the charts."" You had higher levels of this bacteria than 100% of the comparison group. You were in the extreme outlier zone for this infection.

• November 2025 (Current): 13th Percentile 

• What this means: You are now in the bottom tier. 87% of people have more of this bacteria than you do. You successfully went from the very top to the very bottom.

2. Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Production (The Toxin)

This ranks your potential to produce the toxic gas that causes SIBO symptoms.

• December 2024 (Before): 97th Percentile 

• What this means: You were in the top 3% of gas producers. Your gut was a massive factory for Hydrogen Sulfide compared to the general population.

• November 2025 (Current): 33rd Percentile 

• What this means: You are now well below average. You produce less gas than the majority (67%) of healthy people.

Summary of the Shift

You went from the Top 1-3% (Critical Danger Zone) to the Bottom 13-33% (Safe Zone). This is statistically a massive recovery.

I spent an unbelievable amount of money trying to fix this. Easily $30,000 plus on every protocol, supplement, practitioner, and treatment I could find.

The BiomeSight test itself costs about $150 and takes a few weeks to come back. The only hard part is that you need to be able to have a bowel movement to do it.

My biggest takeaway and honestly my only advice is this: don’t overthink it. Just do the BiomeSight test. If you want to work with a functional medicine doctor too, that’s fine, but AI is essentially a supercomputer, and you get instant answers and you can ask it endless questions.

I literally asked it to act as a world-renowned functional medicine doctor, analyze my BiomeSight results, and tell me what was actually driving my symptoms and how to fix them. That was the turning point.

What I started at the end of March and continued through June was very simple, but I was consistent:

•	Garlic, 2 to 3 times a day

•	Oregano, 2 to 3 times a day

•	Artichoke, twice a day

•	Ginger, twice a day

•.    Four Thorne DE almost every time I ate - sometimes I did two but for dinner it was always four

•	Acetylcholine support in the morning

•	Phosphatidylcholine support at night

•	HCl once in the morning

•	No salads, only small amounts of cooked vegetables

•	Stopped Starbucks coffee and switched to a healthier coffee option

Some other things I can add, but those are the big ones.

I eventually added pure butyrate and Akkermansia, but I had already been having regular bowel movements and significantly less bloating for at least two to three months before adding those. I was one of those SIBO patients who was genuinely afraid of probiotics.",2,1765766241.0,SIBO,1,0.63,False
1pmw98t,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pmw98t/fwb_confuses_me/,FWB confuses me,"I (28 F) am recently going through a divorce. I have a ‘fwb’ (33 M) which used to be just a friend and we met at work more than a year ago. We have been seeing each other for 2 months. 

He was previously engaged and that ended about a year ago. We are very good friends and despite me not trusting men since I was cheated on, I actually like his character and he’s been honest with me since the beginning. 

I asked him for clarity the other day because he takes me out every day. We go out to eat, go for runs together, coffee runs, errands, etc. We cook for each other and are there for each other. My brother was in town and he took both of us out and formally met my brother, which for me is huge. I don’t know if he understands that I don’t do that with just anyone. My family has only met my husband. We’ve hung out every day for more than two weeks without sex because my brother is around and I honestly don’t want to have sex in a hotel and he doesn’t want to have sex with his roommates in the house. Whatever, i’m okay with it. He spends the night ALL (I mean around 4-5 times a week) the time. Brings me things I need, fixes things around the house, etc. 

He started telling his friends about me and let me know before hand. I’ve met some of them and we’ve all hung out before. His ex fiancé makes TikToks about her relationship ending all the time and he asked me if I was okay with people knowing we were ‘together’ because his ex-fiance will probably be upset and maybe make another TikTok. I said I didn’t care as I didn’t feel we were doing anything wrong. 

He also insists on us being exclusive and constantly asks me to let him know when I get home whenever I go out with friends. He is very much the jealous type. He wants to know who I’m talking to all the time. 

I asked him for clarity and he says he doesn’t want a relationship because he wants to be financially stable and he’s always been the kind of partner to completely provide for his girlfriend and he can’t do that right now. He’s living with roommates and says he wants to get his own place, start a new business and hold a stable job. I can tell money is a bit tight right now but it doesn’t bother me. For me, it’s not a dealbreaker because I actually like him.

He said Im not a placeholder and he’s not interested in having sex with tons of girls that he’s just being honest about where he’s at and is not looking to hurt anyone or waste anyone’s time. He says he needs around one year to focus on ‘himself’ even though he’s ALWAYS with me. He teared up a bit when he said he’ll give me time to think about it and decide for myself.

1pmw4zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/1pmw4zy/godslayer_33_the_bridge/,Godslayer - 33: The Bridge,"The elevator doors opened, revealing a splendid yet impossible garden laid out before them.

Freya and Luna stepped out together, taking in the sight of the Vasilios estate. A place like this should not have existed on a space station. It was a monument to decadence and excess… and yet it was beautiful. More beautiful than anything either of them had seen. As they walked down the stone path toward the mansion ahead, they could not help but be left in awe of the sight before them. 

Tetra had no dominion here, so the two women walked alone. Freya with her blades drawn, Luna carrying her stolen shotgun.

They saw movement in the garden. A pair of guards had noticed them and were coming to investigate. Freya let her droneblade fly, cutting down one of the men, while Luna took the other down with a shotgun blast.

As the two bodies hit the floor, the two women continued walking, their pace barely even slowing. 

There were a few more guards between them and the mansion, but not many. They stood about as much of a chance as the others had and once they were dealt with, Freya and Luna made their way inside.

Through the ornate wooden doors of the mansion, they found themselves in a large entrance hall lined with old world paintings. Luna paused at the sight of them. She’d never seen anything like them before. Freya was less impressed. She scanned the building around them, before her eyes settled on the stairway.

   “Let’s check up there first,” she said, starting up the stairs. She didn’t even make it all the way up before Mason and Cassandra appeared from one of the rooms, Cedar trailing behind them. 

   “Freya? Luna?” Mason asked, half shocked and half relieved.

   “What? You thought we’d forgotten you?” Luna asked, jogging up the other set of stairs to pull Mason into a half hug. His reciprocation wasn’t a half hug. He grabbed her and hugged her tight as if he hadn’t seen her in years.

A big, almost euphoric grin spread across Cassandra’s lips. Cedar just looked relieved. 

   “You guys are a sight for sore eyes,” she said. “We weren’t sure what had happened to you!”

   “Yeah, well it’s been a messy few hours,” Luna admitted. 

   “Where’s your mother?” Freya asked.

Mason and Cassandra traded an uneasy look.

   “In the conference room,” Mason said. “Down the elevator between the stairs.”

   “Good. Saves me the trouble of hunting for her…” 

Freya turned and headed back for the entrance hall, just in time to see Wagner coming through a door. She paused, staring up at Luna and Freya before her lips curled into a grimace.

   “Of course…” she said under her breath. “Of course…”

Luna and Freya both descended the twin sets of stairs, eyes fixated on Wagner.

   “I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised you managed to escape,” Wagner said, staring up at Freya. “And you… first that mess in the atrium with Lupin, and now you? Do none of you people know how to fucking die?”

   “Afraid not. But maybe you can give me a demonstration,” Luna said. 

Wagner scoffed. Her eyes darted between Luna and Freya. The droneblade hovered by the side of the latter.

   “Freya, go deal with the Chairwoman,” Luna said softly. Freya paused and looked over at her, silently questioning her.

   “I’ve got this,” Luna assured her. 

   “Luna, wait…” Mason warned, but Luna raised a hand to silence him.

   “I’ve got it,” she said, before descending the stairs to stand between Wagner and the elevator. 

Freya stared at her, before quietly finishing her descent and heading for the elevator. Mason and Cassandra followed her, although Cedar lingered closer to Luna. Mason looked over at her, and seemed to want to say something, but he knew better than to tell Mason to leave this fight to Luna. This was something she needed to do.

Wagner watched as the others made their way to the elevator. She sized up Luna, before making her move. Luna raised her shotgun, but Wagner was faster, disappearing back through the door she’d originally come in through. Luna’s shotgun blast did little more than leave a crater in the marble floor. 

   “Go!” Luna commanded, before moving to follow Wagner.

The elevator doors opened, Freya stepped inside, followed by Cassandra and Mason. She stared at them, but didn’t argue about their presence, though unarmed, she knew they’d probably be useful. 

As the elevator left, Luna stared back at the entrance hall. She knew that Wagner was on the move. From the corner of her eye, she saw Cedar on the stairs and took the pistol off her belt.

   “You know how to use this?” she asked. 

   “Just because I’m used to a sword doesn’t mean I wasn’t trained,” Cedar replied, taking the gun. 

   “Good. You keep an eye on the elevator, I’ll flush her out and send her your way.”

Cedar nodded and took up a position near the top of the stairs as Luna went hunting.



\*\*\*



The bridge of the Platinum Future was massive, with three rows of technicians monitoring the ship. Admiral Skye sat above them all, watching from his chair as they monitored the situation.

   *“Sir, we’re losing control of several major subsystems. The bridge, engines and Vasilios estate are still secure but we’re losing everything else!”*

   *“Sir, the Voidwalker is still in the atrium! It’s trying to get through to the Vasilios estate!”*

Skye growled under his breath.

   “Send whoever’s left to kill that fucking thing, now!” he demanded. “What’s the status of the engine? Can we go Superluminal?”

   “Soon, sir. The superluminal drive is almost ready, Admiral!”

   “As soon as it’s ready, we launch. Destination Altumare. No delays,” Skye said. “What about Victor Lupin? Where the hell is he?”

   “Sir?” the technician asked. Skye glared at him.

   “He would have come in on the *Dom Pérignon*! Where is he now?”

   “We don’t know, sir. Most of the cameras are offline. We’ve only got limited access and-”

   *“FIND HIM! NOW!”*

The technician nodded, before turning around and immediately finding Victor as he and Noah walked through the doorway, a Tetra drone floating behind them.

Victor raised his pistol, and fired three bullets into the ceiling. Immediately the technicians and bridge crew hit the ground, hands up in fear. Skye scrambled out of his chair, taking cover behind a nearby console.

   “Everybody out!” Noah cried. “Right now!” Victor fired two more shots, and the bridge crew took their chance to flee. From his vantage point behind the console, Skye could see Sawyer amongst them. The man spared a single glance toward Skye, watching him hide, before he made his escape.

Noah let out a breath he’d been holding.

   “Okay… okay… that was easy, right?” he asked, looking over at Victor. He didn’t get a reply, he just headed for one of the nearby consoles.

   “Tetra, close all blast doors. Seal us in,” he said.

   *“Already on it,”* the drone replied. *“Now plug me in so I can sort this shit ou-”*

Skye made his move, emerging from cover and opening fire on the drone. His bullets hit its chassis, damaging it. Unlike before, this version of Tetra had no weaponry. She could do nothing but take off to avoid the gunshots.

Noah hastily raised his rifle, eyes widening at the sight of the Admiral. Skye saw him moving, and spun toward him. He felt Noah’s bullet take a chunk out of his ear, and fired two bullets directly into his stomach.

Noah gasped and stumbled backwards, collapsing against one of the consoles. Skye dove back into cover as Victor returned fire on him, before rushing to Noah’s side. He could see red blossoming on Noah’s white uniform, and felt a sudden panic deep in his own stomach.

Skye had been smart. He knew exactly where Vasilios body armor didn’t cover, and so he’d made a point of aiming there.

   “Hit…” Noah gasped. “Oh fuck…”

   “Put pressure on it…” Victor said, guiding his hands over the wound. He noticed Skye moving to pop out of cover again, and wasted two more bullets to keep him in cover, before dragging Noah to safety behind another console.

   “Fuck… oh fuck… oh fuck…” Noah panted, desperately trying to put pressure on the wound.

Tetra hovered near the top of the bridge, and with no other targets, Skye fixated on her. He fired off three more shots at her. All of them hit. With nowhere to hide, Tetra did the only thing she could. She dove towards him, slamming into his body and knocking Skye to the ground. He grabbed her, using his weight to pin her down as he jammed his pistol against her chassis and emptied his clip into her. She tried to pull out of his grasp, but the damage was done. She only made it a few feet before losing control and crashing.

Victor looked up as she hit the ground. He saw her land a few feet away from them and swore under his breath. Skye climbed back to his feet, panting heavily. His lips curled into a crooked grin. 

   “Hell of a bold move, Lupin…” he said. “Storming in here, guns blazing. You really thought that would work?”

Victor didn’t respond. 

   “I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised,” Skye said as he descended down from his seat. “You always were an idealistic son of a bitch.”

   “I’ll take that over just being a son of a bitch,” Victor called back. Skye chuckled. The laughter was sincere.

   “You know, despite everything, I legitimately did like you, Victor.” he said as he drew closer to the spot where he’d seen him pull Noah to safety. Victor could hear him drawing closer. He tried to pull Noah away with him, but Noah pushed him off.

   *“Go…”* he panted and Victor hesitated for a moment before taking off, staying low and moving to another row of consoles. 

Skye rounded the corner a moment later, his pistol at the ready. Noah glared at him. He tried to raise his rifle, but Skye just put another bullet in his stomach.

Noah howled in pain, and Skye tore the rifle from his hands. 

   “This one here… well, I never gave a shit about him,” Skye said. “Always struck me as kinda a chickenshit. I’m actually surprised he’s made it this far.”

He watched as Noah doubled over in pain, hyperventilating. 

   “I could shoot him right now, you know. Put him out of his fucking misery. I’d say it’s better than what this traitorous little cockroach deserves… but why waste a bullet on a dead man?”

Skye tossed away his empty pistol and kicked him in the stomach, earning another scream from him, before moving on, Noah’s rifle at the ready.

   “I’m surprised any of you made it this far, actually. Your whole mission was just to see if the Gods even could be killed. I wasn’t sure it was possible, but now… oh the possibilities you people have opened up…”

   “You’re making a mistake, Skye…” Victor said. “What exactly do you think happens when the Gods are dead?”

   “Oh don’t tell me you buy into that bullshit the Chairwoman believes…” Skye scoffed. “The end of the Universe. Come on. Is that really why you’re doing all this? The Old Gods are just relics, Victor. We’ve got new Gods now. Vasilios, De Vries, Gold Sun. That’s the new Divinity. That’s what I’m gonna be part of.”

He noticed movement behind one of the consoles and drew closer to it, lips curling into a grin. 

   “When I’m done with you, this station is going Superluminal. We’re going to Altumare. We’re going to kill the final God. Then Campbell is going to use his little infinite devil machine to secure Vasilios’ place above its competition. You can’t stop it Victor. This is the future!”

He rounded the corner, only to find nothing waiting for him.

   “Come on, Victor…” he growled. “Stop running. What? Did you lose your balls in that crash?”

He noticed a flurry of movement behind him and turned just in time to see Victor vaulting over the console, and lunging for him, grabbing at his rifle. Skye held on tight as Victor tried to wrestle it from him, the two men grappling over the gun.

A few feet away, Noah crawled across the floor, a hand pressed to his stomach. He crawled toward the sparking husk of Tetra, before plugging his Tac Band into her. 

   “Stay with me now…”He panted. “Please be in there… please…”

A familiar shark logo appeared on his display and he let out a breathless laugh.

Mere feet away, Victor and Skye continued their duel. Victor ejected the magazine and hurled it aside. Skye threw his weight against him, pinning him against one of the consoles. The rifle discharged and Skye finally ripped it from Victor’s grasp before aiming it at him. He pulled the trigger, but without a clip, the gun would not fire.

His error got him punched in the jaw. Victor’s meaty fist knocked the other man to the ground. The empty rifle fell from his hands. He tasted blood.

Skye looked up at Victor, watching as he rolled up his sleeves.

   “Come on,” Victor spat. “Get up. Or did you lose your balls with your frigate?”

Skye let out a furious growl and picked himself up, before lunging at Victor once more.

On the ground, Noah dragged himself toward one of the consoles. He connected his Tac Band to it, and watched as a progress bar appeared on the screen. With a trembling hand, he slipped his Tac Band off his wrist, leaving it connected to the console before he finally collapsed. 

Nearby, Victor and Skye continued their brawl. Skye’s nose was already broken. A chunk of his ear was missing, thanks to Noah’s stray bullet. But he didn’t go down. 

Victor threw a left hook, catching Skye in the head. He reeled, but ducked the next punch, before crashing into Victor and pounding his ribs with his fists. He knocked the wind out of Victor, before pushing him back against one of the consoles. As he hit the console, he knocked the personal items one of the bridge crew had kept there to the ground, including a coffee mug. The mug shattered on impact. 

Victor tried to pick himself up, but Skye was already on top of him, driving his fist into his face and tossing him to the ground. Again, Victor tried to stand. Skye watched him, before noticing the broken mug on the ground. He grabbed a jagged piece of the broken mug, not caring that it cut into his hand, and wielding it like a makeshift dagger. He slashed at Victor’s stomach, only barely missing. 

Victor watched him cautiously, taking a wary step back. Skye glared back at him, his eyes burning with a hatred to match the hatred in Victor’s eyes. He waited, goading Victor into attacking again, silently daring him to move. It was a dare Victor couldn’t deny. His eyes darted between Skye’s makeshift dagger, and the man himself, planning his move before he made it.

Victor faked him out. Skye took the bait, slashing with his makeshift dagger and leaving himself open for Victor to come at him from the side. His fist connected with Skye’s temple, leaving the man seeing stars. While he reeled, Victor kneed him in the chest, and tore the ceramic shard from his hands before pushing him back.

As he fell, Skye reached out toward the console to steady himself. He felt a button depress under his palm, and a voice echoed through the bridge.

   “**Warning. Bridge gravity drive disabled.”**

A moment later, Skye was floating. From the corner of his eye, he could see Victor doing the same. He could see the confusion on his face and took advantage of it, lunging at him and tackling him into the ceiling. 

His hands closed around Victor’s throat and squeezed. The man fought beneath his grasp. He kneed him in the stomach, but Skye’s grip was too tight. He struggled. Fought. But he could not escape.

   “Face it, Victor… you can’t win this,” Skye growled. “You’re not a soldier. You’re not a pilot. You’re not even a real fucking doctor. You’re just a theoretical physicist.”

The voice on the intercom spoke once again.

   **“Superluminal drive ready to launch.”**

Skye’s grin grew wider.

   “You lose, Victor…” he hissed.

Noah floated nearby, his skin already growing pale. He looked over to see Skye pinning Victor to the ceiling. He could see his struggles getting weaker. With the last of his strength, he pressed his feet against one of the consoles and kicked off, launching himself toward Skye. The Admiral had no time to react before Noah hit him, pushing him off of Victor. He scrambled in rage, before kicking Noah off, sending him spiraling toward one of the doors to the bridge. 

Thinking fast, Victor went after him. Skye watched as he retreated. The two men crashed against the far wall, and Victor crawled toward the door controls. Skye kicked off from the ceiling, grabbing onto the consoles to pursue them, as Victor opened the door to the bridge.

The gravity in the hall pulled all three of them toward it. Victor and Noah were pulled through, while Skye landed beside it. He crawled toward the door controls, and shut them, before sealing himself inside.

As they lay in the hall outside of the bridge, Victor pulled Noah into a sitting position. His breathing was low and shallow. His skin was white.

   “S-sorry, Doc…” he panted. “Sorry…”

   “Don’t be…” Victor said softly. “We did our best. That’s what counts.”

   “I… I tried to get Tetra into the system… I… I don’t know if she…” Noah’s voice trailed off. The mere act of speaking was getting harder and harder.

   “It’s alright,” Victor assured him. “You did good, Noah. You did good.”

   “We… failed…”

   “No,” Victor said. “We didn’t…”



\*\*\*



On the bridge, Admiral Skye pulled himself back toward his chair. He could see it just ahead of him. His heart was racing in excitement. 

His moment of triumph was there.



\*\*\*



   “You know… superluminal engines are an incredible piece of technology…” Victor said, gently taking Noah’s hand. “I mean it would have to be, to cause a ship to accelerate to a speed so fast that it’s not even visible to the naked eye. That kind of acceleration… you ever wonder what that might do to a person?”

Noah’s eyes widened in understanding.

Skye crawled to the console by his chair. On the dashboard, he could see a screen with a notification on it.

**Superluminal Drive ready.**

He reached for it.

   “Normally a ship’s gravity drive can compensate for the force of acceleration,” Victor said wistfully. “Without it? Well, I imagine that one would cross from biology… into physics.”

Admiral Fabian Skye hit the button to engage the Platinum Future’s superluminal drive. A wild grin spread across his lips as he hovered above the console. He could hear the engines growing louder, preparing for the jump. His heart was racing in anticipation. This was his mome



\*\*\*



There was a low hum as the station went superluminal. Victor closed his eyes and exhaled through his nostrils, before letting out a low, knowing chuckle.

   “You did good,” he said to Noah. “You did really good…”

   ***“Superluminal drive engaged,”*** Tetra said over the intercom. ***“Destination, Pragaras.”***

   “Thank you, Tetra.” Victor said. 

Noah let out a weak laugh.

   “We… we did it…?” he asked.

   “You did it,” Victor corrected. “You got your chance. You took it. I’m proud of you.”

Noah’s lips curled into a weak smile.

   “Did it…” he repeated. His grip on Victor’s hand was getting weaker. 

   “Doc… if we get out of this… will you take me back to my Mom…? I wanna… I wanna see how she’s…”

   “Of course…” Victor promised. “Anywhere you want to go, I’ll take you there. Anywhere you want to go.”

Noah didn’t respond. He lay slumped against the wall, the light in his eyes faded. Victor still held his hand, kneeling beside him, smiling a weak, trembling smile.

   “You did good, friend…” he said. “You did good… you did good…”

His forehead rested against Noah’s, and he let out a shaky exhale. He could feel tears threatening to fall, but he held them back. He stayed with Noah for a moment longer, before gently picking him up.

   “Tetra, bring the gravity back online and open the doors to the bridge.”

The doors opened, without a single word from the drone and Victor carried Noah in. There was a thick, coppery smell of blood in the air, and a pulpy smear of blood and fabric along the far wall of the bridge, staining the Admiral’s chair. 

Victor set Noah’s body down before ascending to the Admiral’s post.

   “Let’s take the ship out of superluminal speed for now,” he said, his voice still shaking a little. “Lock the doors to the bridge. No one else comes in until I give the word.”

   ***“Yes sir,”*** Tetra replied, her tone graver than before. ***“It’s done.”***

   “Thank you…”

   ***“I’m sorry…”***

Victor gave a solemn nod and finally let the tears come.",1,1765765847.0,HeadOfSpectre,0,1.0,False
1pmw4vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1pmw4vz/27m_caught_in_a_hell_loop_about_pain_au_chocolate/,"(27M) Caught in a Hell loop about Pain Au Chocolate 🥐🍫 by my (26F) partner. How can I stop the story from getting taller, and constantly repeating?!","TL;DR: this is going to sound minor or goofy, but every time she tells this “silly” story it gets a bit taller, and paints me as a worse person.

I have told her how it makes me feel, and she says she won’t keep beating me like a dead horse… but “forgets”. It has been going on for two years now…

Any tips on how to stop this Hell loop?

.

.

Summary Question: I feel like I don’t have the tools in my tool kit to deal with this. And I am hoping that you might be able to lend advice or experience.

I have tried listening and apologizing, another time changing the conversation topic to refocus or another time being playful trying “tease” her back about the situation; but it is not well received.

So this is just a gentlemen who does enjoy pastries, 🥐 and also ice cream. 🍨 But is very must not enjoying this hell loop. 🙃

.

.

Full Story: when we were first dating she picked me up at the airport. I was expecting just a curb side pick up, but to my surprise I heard my name when I was standing at the baggage claim, and behind me was this gorgeous woman in a super cute outfit holding fresh pain au chocolates. 🥐🍫

I also felt so caught off guard, I was expecting to take her out somewhere for cafe after she picked me up. I did not bring her a gift to reciprocate… I should’ve gotten flowers or her favourite coffee order 🙃

She gives me a big hug, and then shoves a couple of pastries towards me. They looked delicious, but also extremely fluffy and flakey; perfect qualities for enjoyment… but not for eating in the middle of an airport, with no napkins.

I come from a fairly neat and tidy up brining and culture. So the idea of eating them right then and there and making a huge mess both on my own clothes and in a public space with no way to clean it up… certainly appalled me 😅 and from her reaction I guess that was plain as day on my face 🙃

She mood immediately changed, and she said something to the effect of “oh you don’t like pastries?!”. And I replied something along the lines of “I do, but can we eat them later?” Then I saw my bag come out, and had to retrieve it.

We caught the train over to where she had parked, the air being a bit tense. She kept apologizing, and I kept insuring they looked delicious and I was looking forward to sharing them. She insisted the flakey pastries were ok to eat in her car, and it was alright to make a mess with delicious flakes and melted chocolate, as she drove me back to her flat.

She kept insisting that I must not have liked them, and that she should have gotten me something else. I kept trying to reassure her that I did like the pastries, but I felt uncomfortable making a mess and also eating on my own in-front of her, instead of enjoying the pastries together.

She would not take yes for an answer, that I liked pastries and that the pain do chocolates were good, they were delicious btw. And then she started a different approach asking about what foods or treats I might like better. I tried to keep insisting that I liked the pastries and they were great and a super sweet gift. But eventually I caved and said that I also liked ice cream, and suggested that I get us some. I was hoping that would help re aim the conversation 😅

Anyways, fast forward to modern day. It has now been years and every time I suggest we get pastries, or we go out to a bakery or cafe with friends she retells the story from her point of view and “teases” me for hating bread and pastries. But the story keeps getting shorter in length and taller in facts.

Today we were discussing Christmas gifts, and I know she has been wanting a stand up mixer or bread box for baking. But I wanted her input on which one would be best, as I know they are a very personal thing. She was asking what she could get me in return. I suggested maybe the new chip I have been looking at for a home project, but it was a bit expensive (around the same price as the mixer she had picked out for me to purchase). And se noted how expensive it was.

So I suggested maybe she could purchase the ingredients and we could bake some breads together over the holidays for my gift. I am not a very consumerist person, my main love languages is quality time, and I know how expensive the holiday season can be.

Instead the conversation suddenly shifts with “You don’t even like bread tho I can’t just give you bread for Christmas”

and I get another 20 minute hell loop of being retold the same story but this time shortened “I’m sure he’ll love these!”, “Oh how am I supposed to eat it here?” and “I like ice cream better”.

While also getting taller and more emphasis with statements like “The heartbreak I felt when you said you like ice cream is a heartbreak I’ll remember until we’re dead”.

Please help, how can I stop this Hell loop… I tried to explain once again how this makes me feel to her. And she apologizes and says she won’t do it again. But she also said the same thing last week, and last month, and before that. But keeps “forgetting”.

I feel like I don’t have the tools in my tool kit to deal with this. I have tried changing the conversation topic to refocus or being playful trying “tease” her back about the situation but it is not well received.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Tell a Crossbar from a Goalpost*

The Premier League’s gladiatorial arena this Monday sees Manchester United host Bournemouth in a clash that’s less “title decider” and more “please don’t let the Bournemouth defense embarrass itself again.” Let’s parse the numbers, news, and why this game might be the yawn-inducing snoozer of the week—or a last-minute thriller where someone scores with their elbow.

---

### Odds Breakdown: United’s Implied Probabilities Are as Sturdy as a Brick Wall

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Manchester United, with most lines pegging them at **-200** (decimal \~1.8). Using our trusty formula, this implies a **55.5% chance of victory** for United. Bournemouth, meanwhile, sits at **+400** (decimal \~4.0), translating to a **25% implied win probability**. The draw? A paltry **23.8%** (at +4.1).

In layman’s terms: United is the overcooked steak, and Bournemouth is the undercooked noodle. The middle ground? A stalemate that’ll leave fans on both sides wondering why their team couldn’t score a penalty.

### Injury Reports: United’s Defense Is a Jigsaw Puzzle Missing Two Pieces

Manchester United is without **De Ligt** and **Maguire**, two center-backs who’ve been more prone to injury than a toddler in a pinata factory. However, **Lisandro Martínez** returns, which is like getting your favorite coffee back after a three-day outage. Bournemouth’s woes are starker: **Veljko Milosavljevic** (knee) is out for 2–3 months, and **Ryan Christie** is sidelined. But **Lewis Cook** and **Tyler Adams** return, which is good news unless you’re a fan of chaotic midfield tangles.

Bournemouth’s away record this season reads like a horror movie: **0-6-0**. They’ve conceded goals faster than a vegan at a steakhouse. United, meanwhile, has gone three games unbeaten, which is about as shocking as discoverin

*Where the Odds Favor the Gladiators, but the Plot Twists Are Free*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: The Math of Misery and Might**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a Roman emperor crushing rebellion. The odds for this Matchday 15 showdown are as clear as a gelato on a hot day:

* **AS Roma** is the favorite, with decimal odds ranging from **2.15 to 2.26** (implied probability: **44.4% to 47%**).
* **Como** is the underdog, priced between **3.4 and 3.85** (implied probability: **26.3% to 28.5%**).
* The **draw** sits at **3.0 to 3.2** (implied probability: **31.3% to 33.3%**).

Translation? Bookmakers think Roma has a solid edge, but this isn’t a cakewalk. The spread favors Roma by a sliver (-0.25), and the total goals line hovers around **2.25-2.5**, with “Under” slightly more likely. In betting terms, this is a “pick ‘em with a side of hesitation.”

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Form, and the Ghost of Inter’s 4-0**  
Let’s dig into the teams’ recent performances, because nothing says “confidence” like a 4-0 loss to Inter.

* **AS Roma (27 points, 4th):** Fresh off a **1-0 home defeat to Cagliari**, Roma’s offense looks like a baker without flour—still functional, but not inspiring. They’ve scored **15 goals** in 14 games (1.07/gm) and conceded **8** (0.57/gm). Key man **Tammy Abraham** is their goal-scoring hero, but his hamstring “recovery” involves more coffee and less tripping over shoelaces (unlike, say, Fiorentina’s striker, who’s out after a *literal* faceplant).
* **Como (24 points, 6th):** The northern side just got **wrecked 4-0 by Inter**, a defeat so惨 that their goalkeeper might need a new nickname—\*“The Human S

Getting no nibbles with agents on a second query letter I wrote, I took a stab at this one. I shifted from trying to get the absurdist tone in the letter itself and make the (hopefully) more compelling narrative stand out.

Thanks in advance!

\------------

Dear (AGENT):

Steve Sludcock didn’t plan on offering to film a political assassination. Just like he didn’t mean to get fired from his job; or pilloried by the digital mob over a few jokes; or kicked out of his house and his marriage. But, you know, things happen.

When his cookie-cutter life is turned on its head after a standup set goes unexpectedly viral, Steve gets trapped in a depressive malaise. He only leaves his lonely motel room to send out a few job applications he never hears back from or to get a cup of coffee at a diner with another aimless misfit, Crusty Joe. Adrift in an unfeeling universe, unmoored from all that gave his life purpose, Steve starts to think that maybe his life doesn’t matter; maybe it’s all meaningless. If there’s no plan, if there’s no direction, if there’s no end-goal, maybe life’s not even worth the bother.

The arrival of a package with a password-protected disk piques Steve’s interest for the first time in months. With nothing to go off of but the cryptic note that came with the package, he fantasizes that the drive contains a message from someone powerful, calling him to a higher purpose. The only thing that gives Steve any reprieve from his nihilistic spirals are the nights he spends with Crusty Joe scouring the Internet, looking for clues as to the origins of the package’s sender. As each new day dawns in his moldy, dim motel room, Steve starts to see the package as his last hope at proving that his life is worth something.

A rousing speech at a campaign rally convinces the desperate Steve that the package has been sent to him by the president of the United States. He sets out for Washington, DC, determined to show the world that he is a person of consequence, that all the failures of his life were preparing him for greatness. Because if he’s not part of some grand plan, then what’s the point of being alive?

OH WELL: ADVENTURES IN FUTILITY (79,000 words) is a darkly funny satire illuminating the outrageously depressing world we humans have created for ourselves. It combines the syncopated humor of works like *Liberation Day* (George Saunders) and *Lake of Urine* (Guillermo Stitch) with the mad cap adventure of *Dr. No* (Percival Everett).

1pmw2dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pmw2dq/i_cant_stand_my_sister_anymore/,I can’t stand my sister anymore.,"6 year age gap between my younger sister and I (currently 24 and 18). 
When we were children, we got along just fine. Unfortunately around the age of 16 (would place me around 22) things started to get worse. 

My sister is a person who wants to command all of the attention in the room. Given every opportunity, in almost every conversation- I find it is simply her just talking about herself, or things going on in her life. To the point when I observe her speaking with others or even just daily interactions with our close family it comes across as .. well put simply extremely self absorbed. 
My parents seem to adore this about her, and praise everything she does in life. We have chosen different paths in life, I run a small construction business and take online classes while she goes to a higher end university (paid for by our parents). When she was 17, she would constantly ridicule me for not having bought my own place yet and still living with our parents. 

Up until she moved out for school, she would lash out in the middle of conversations to the point I would end up in tears. I remember the last incident being brought on by me offering to tag along with our parents on a trip she was taking with her boyfriend to the mountains for a few days. 

To which she responded that I was a dumb b!tch and it was all my fault that we weren’t all taking a family trip to (her choice of Montana) so now naturally she doesn’t want us to come to her alternative. 

Keep in mind I could not get the time off work for her Montana itinerary, and lacked the enthusiasm of driving 23 hours for a 3 DAY STAY only to turn around and drive back home (to fit within her schedule). 


My parents treat her differently, in recent years it’s become very obvious she is the favourite. Which only makes me more resentful of the entire situation. Her and my mother will snuggle up on the couch for a movie they picked together gossiping like they are in high school again while I’m in the same room, no invitation extended to watch said movie too. 

They plan coffee dates, shopping trips, etc. I have never received that kindness or side of my mother in my 24 years.  My mother is one of those people that feel the need to play opposition or devils advocate to your situation inEVERY given circumstance and it’s driven us apart in my adulthood admittedly. If your dog was murdered in front of you, she would still find a way to have sympathy for said murderer- not you. In fact it’s YOUR fault the dog was stabbed ! 

When she left for university, she basically stopped talking to everyone in the family. Now I know you will say we were the problem here- however, she DOES phone home whenever she wants something, or needs to vent or get something off of her chest. Not to me, I never hear from her. My mother catches strays here and there from her whenever she takes the time to connect from her “extremely busy life life on her own now”

She’s home for the holidays, and I find myself falling into another bout over the routine shift in my parents behaviour now that she’s here again. Every time I attempt to strike up a conversation, I feel like I’m met with judgment and backlash from her. 

It’s like the most hostile, awful high school attitude I’ve ever seen EVERY time I try to talk to her. I’ve tried to bring this up in the past, what I’ve done to make her act like this towards me- and I’ve never gotten an answer. 

Do you have a sibling you’ve grown to not stand? How do you cope with the heartbreak?

i sometimes work from coffee shops when i need a change of scenery and my coworker mentioned i should get a vpn but honestly im not sure what it actually does besides maybe hiding stuff from my ISP? like is a vpn for windows gonna make a real difference for someone who just does normal internet stuff?

main questions, does it actually protect anything important or is it mostly placebo? will it slow down my already mediocre laptop? and are the free ones sketchy or good enough?

also does windows have any built in protection that makes vpns less necessary or am i just being naive about security?

anyone actually use a vpn on windows regularly and feel like it matters? or is it one of those things that sounds important but doesnt really affect normal people?",0,1765765575.0,software,1,0.5,False
1pmw0vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/1pmw0vi/i_am_the_mom_of_two_adult_children_and_7_siblings/,I am the mom of two adult children and 7 siblings.,"As it gets closer and closer to Christmas I miss my family more than ever. I am the second to the youngest of 8 children. We grew up poor but my mom never let us know just how poor we were. She was not very loving nor affectionate but we knew we were loved. When I was little I always said I wanted nothing more than to be a mom just like my mom. Fast forward its 1984 and I am pregnant a senior in high school and so very happy because all I wanted was a red haired blue eyed baby girl and 9 months later she was born exactly as I wanted. A year and 8 days later her brother arrived and I was a 19 year old with 2 little babies and what I thought was the love of my life. Boy how wrong I was, but that's a story for another day. Anyway, I moved out of my moms house into his mothers 2 bedroom trailer, 25 miles from the closest town and was not allowed to mention my family I missed so so much or bad things happened. Eventually we did reconnect and all was good until 5 years ago when my mom came to live with me. By this time my children are grown and living in Rhode Island and D.C. My mom had 2 strokes and 2 heart attacks in a 10 hour period and I was there when they happened. Off to the hospital we go and she is in a coma for 9 days and I was there almost every hour except when someone else came to sit with her so I could go home and shower and eat. When she finally comes back to us, she is in 4 different nursing homes because one sucked just as much as the other if not worse. She had to learn to do everything all over again and the nursing homes would do very little with her they say because of her insurance but, again a story for another day. My younger brother is her POA so he decided along with one of my older sisters that she should live in a nursing home for the rest of her days and I was completely against it and she would cry and cry and beg me not to leave her there forever. Then a miracle happened, one of my older sisters and her husband inherited a bunch of money and bought a house with an attached apartment that my mom could live in and she would be ‘home’. I would go over during the day and take care of her and my sister would be there at night. Then my sister decided she didn't want me there any more and told me not to come back, must have been something I said when her and her hubby left my mom at night when she still couldn't take care of herself. Big fight happened and that was the end of me visiting my mom unless I went and picked her up and brought her to my house which I did several times during the week. One day she was at my house and she kept saying her head her and she was rubbing the back of it. I said momma did you bump it somewhere and she said yeah I fell in the middle of the night and hit my head on the coffee table. She had a goose egg on her head and it didn't look good so I rushed her to the ER and she told the nurse and the case worker what happened and they said she could not go back to my sisters house nor did she want to. So I live in a duplex with one side empty and much to my boyfriends dismay I moved her in with me. Oh we had so much fun for awhile then she started telling my sisters that I was neglecting her and that I never took her any where, basically everything she told me happened at my other sisters house she told the same thing to my older siblings and they believed her so they moved her to another state stuck her in a nursing home and I haven't seen or heard from her since. I went through a very bad and long depression and I really had no reason to be alive, but with the help of my doctor a good therapist and God I made it through that horrible time. After I came back to my senses I started doing things I am not proud of and for those reasons I am not going to mention my family including my children and my extended family have all deserted me. My older sister passed away of cancer 4 years ago and my older sister told me if I showed up at the funeral home I would be arrested so I didn't go, I don't think I wanted to but that is not the point. The choice was taken from me and I don't know if I will ever forgive my sister for doing that, her, my deceased sister and me were like 3 peas in a pod now my pod is empty. My daughter refuses to talk to me because of the mistakes I have made , my son moved half way around the world and didn't tell me, I found out on Facebook. I have 2 brothers that live within 30 minutes of me, a sister who lives 15 minutes from me and my extended family, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews all within a 5 mile radius and now talks to me. I pray every night that God will heal my heart and also theirs. I am not sure why I am putting this out there, I guess I am hoping with it being out in the universe something might change. I hope that one day we can all forgive each other and be the family we once used to be but if there is one thing I am certain of my family is not going to give in quietly. When my mom was able to live on her own I was always there for her even after working 12 hour days I would still drive 15 minutes to her house and make sure she ate or had a little bit of human connection. She lived in an apartment building but was very much an introvert. Of all the things I have done good in my life everyone seems to forget the good things they only remember the bad things. Yes, I am a good person, unfortunately they cant seemed to get past the bad parts. My heart hurts most at this time of year and I cry myself to sleep almost every night and I pray every night that good will guide me in the right direction as I continue to miss everyone. I know every one says God works in his time not ours and I know eventually he will give me the answers I am so desperately looking for but, until that happens I will continue to cry, I will continue to be alone, I will continue to seek the comfort and love I so desperately want from my children, my mom, my siblings and my extended family. If you are so brave to have read this very long winded saga I call my life please if you will say a little prayer for me and my family.

1pmvxaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1pmvxaj/long_permanent_effects_after_too_much_taurine_one/,[LONG] Permanent effects after too much Taurine one time? Possible OD?,"Growing up, I would love drinking energy drinks. However it wasn't until a few years ago to where I started drinking coffee. I was so used to getting my caffeine with taurine in it. I noticed that without coffee, a single cup of a regular roast of coffee's worth of caffeine would make me incredibly jittery which could hurt or help depending on a number of factors. When I would go back to drinking energy drinks, it would feel way more predictable and far less anxiety-enducing. I looked at the ingredients shared between the various energy drinks I would have and the most obvious common denominator was a gram of Taurine in every serving. However, I really enjoyed the taste of the coffee and it's a lot cheaper and way more accessible than most energy drinks. So, I figured that I should get some Taurine supplements and take it with my morning coffee. 


I ordered a bottle of Nutricost 1000mg capsules. I would take a single one with my morning coffee and I felt far less anxious and my focus was a lot better. Then, one day, my brain wasn't braining: I take a lot of mental health medications and confused my dosages and accidentally took 3 grams of Taurine at aroumd 1pm with my first coffeeof the day. I don't remember feeling EXCESSIVELY anxious and I things were fine until about 10:00 PM, where I started getting crazy heart palpitations (if that's what it's called, my heart rate just felt overwhelmingly rratic and noticeably inconsistent beat-to-beat). It would continue until about 1 to 2 AM where it didn't fully resolve, but I somehow managed to fall asleep.


I connected the dots the next day and decided to avoid Taurine for a while.


2 or 3 weeks later, I decided I would try and take a single gram of Taurine with my one coffee of the day at like 11 AM. Again, I don't remember feeling very odd during the day, but again, late that night, my chest felt crazy and I took an emergency klonopin that I'm prescribed to use on an as-needed basis once or twice a month. It seemed to help the racing-heart calm down a little better versus trying to wait it out like the previous time.


 Still, something was clearly wrong.


I, again, stayed away from the Taurine for quite a while, at least a month and a half. I thought ""maybe it's an issue with these specific supplements, the batch, the brand, etc"" and I bought an energy drink to have with my lunch: The brand of which I was very intimately familiar with its effects on me. I had a single one with no coffee that day, adding up to 1 gram of Taurine.


Then at 11 PM, it happened again.


I waited a few more months, avoided the supplement bottle, and tried a gram of the stuff again in the form of an energy drink at lunch. And later that night, it happened again.


It's been 8 to 10 months since I've consumed ANY amount of Taurine at all. With my current tolerance to caffeine, a single one when I'm still half asleep at a AM on weekdays leads to minimal anxiety. Any more, and I get unpredictable results. For the past 2 and half years, I take 4mg of Risperidone in the morning and at night, and 800mg of Seroquel, 200mg of Zoloft, and 3mg of Prazosin (for nightmares) at night. I get little to no noticeable side effects from the meds, have had positive experiences with Taurine while on this regimen, and they treat my Schizophrenia, GAD, depression, and PTSD very very well. I go to group therapy almost every weekday and see my prescriber once a month. My mental health recovery, in general, has been outstanding if I do say so myself.


When I quit the Taurine entirely, my dissatisfaction with my Caffeine use lead me to pursue adding an ADHD med to my routine. I was prescribed various forms of amphetamines for many years but eventually lost touch with my psychiatrist as I moved an hour away from him. A few years would pass and I would observe psychotic symptoms sparked by a sudden change in my reaction to cannabis (which seemed to help me for a long time). I would quit weed, get hospitalized twice in about a year, and try various antipsychotics until I wound up at my program with my current routine of meds. Due to my new predisposition to psychosis and history of drug use, my current prescriber would be hesitant to put me on stimulants, which is understandable. After quitting Taurine, we started with daily Strattera, a non-stimulant ADHD med. It made no difference. Eventually we would try 150mg of daily Wellbutrin, a semi-stimulating substance. I didn't like it at all and endured a switch to 300mg for some time before weaning back off. With that not helping, my prescriber cautiously approved of a small amount of 10mg Vyvanse (the lowest available dosage). Vyvanse is far more harm reductive than standard forms of amphetamines such as Adderall as it's inactive until it hits the Amidase enzymes in gour blood. At a certain threshold that's different between different people, you run out of Amidase and taking more Vyvanse only makes the effects last *longer* as opposed to feeling *stronger* as your body works to slowly replenish your Amidase.

I assumed he would want me to take it EVERY day as to face more of the long-term effects as opposed to the obvious short-term effects, but he would instruct me to take it on  weekends only so I can work on my DIY electronics projects and music production sessions. His thinking was that by not taking it Every day, it would help prevent a dependant mindset. However, as a compromise, I would lose access to Klonopin as he was worried about me having access to multiple controlled substances. I was okay with this because several months ago, I started taking Magnesium Glycinate as a ""softer"" alternative to benzos that I could take every night as to avoid using Klonopin, which I only took for rare late-night feelings of panic. 


I've been taking the Vyvanse 1 to 3 times a week for about 2 months  now and the difference is fantastic. I don't binge eat anymore, but can get meals in. I'm motivated and focused, but not anxious. I'm alert, but can fall asleep at night. The intrusive thoughts and psychotic concepts are far more fleeting and easier to ignore as I reach flow-states, while not getting manic. My parents are keenly in-tune with my symptoms and aren't picking up on any hyperfixation. I've started taking care of my body better, showering and brushing my teeth more often. My room is consistently organized. And during the week, I'm so happy amd satisfied with my work I get done over the weekend, that I ride out the feeling of accomplishment in a more calm state as I take part in my group therapy program, spend time with my girlfriend, and write down ideas and goals for the next weekend. 


Things are amazing.


But I'm left wondering: will I ever be able to enjoy the battery-acid flavor of a good 'ol standard can of Monster ever again? Why did my reaction to all sources of Taurine change after a single incident? I don't take any supplements besides 300mg of Naturemaid Magnesium Glycinate right before bed and a gummy multivitamin in the morning. My full panel returned all normal results aside from elevated Pro Lactin levels which can be attributed to my meds. Liver function tests returned normal. A1C is 5.8. 


Did taking 3 grams of Taurine a single time fuck up the way my body/brain handles it for good??

##🪵 Episode introduction by the Log Lady

>The beautiful thing about treasure is that it exists. It exists to be found. How beautiful it is to find treasure. Where is the treasure, that when found, leaves one eternally happy? I think we all know it exists. Some say it is inside us -- inside us one and all. That would be strange. It would be so near. Then why is it so hard to find, and so difficult to attain?

##🚨 Warnings from the Future

Be wary, travelers! In Twin Peaks, even the numbers can be...slippery. Some sources label the Pilot as Episode 0, while others count it as Episode 1. To stay on track, follow the episode titles, not just the numbers. Write it in your diary.

If you've just arrived in Twin Peaks, you should know the original U.S. pilot (1 hour 34 minutes) is the true beginning. It opens the door slowly, letting the fog roll in and the mysteries breathe. The so-called ""International Release"" (1 hour 52 minutes) tacks on an ending that concludes the case far too soon, unraveling secrets meant to linger in shadow.

##🪵 Episode introduction by the Log Lady

>Sometimes, well let's say all times, things are changing. We are judged as human beings on how we treat our fellow human beings. How do you treat your fellow human beings? At night, just before sleep, as you lay by yourself in the dark, how do you feel about yourself? Are you proud of your behavior? Are you ashamed of your behavior? You know in your heart if you have hurt someone, you know. If you have hurt someone, don't wait another day before making things right. The world could break apart with sadness in the meantime.

##🚨 Warnings from the Future

Be wary, travelers! In Twin Peaks, even the numbers can be...slippery. Some sources label the Pilot as Episode 0, while others count it as Episode 1. To stay on track, follow the episode titles, not just the numbers. Write it in your diary.

If you've just arrived in Twin Peaks, you should know the original U.S. pilot (1 hour 34 minutes) is the true beginning. It opens the door slowly, letting the fog roll in and the mysteries breathe. The so-called ""International Release"" (1 hour 52 minutes) tacks on an ending that concludes the case far too soon, unraveling secrets meant to linger in shadow.

Salem

June 13, 10:03 PM

     Her father hands her a pistol. A rifle is already slung over his shoulder.

     “This is a high point c9. Nine millimeter,” he says. “It has eight shots. Don't play with it. Don't point it at your brother. Don't look down the barrel. Keep the safety off. You only point it at someone if you intend to shoot. You only shoot if you intend to kill.”

     The gun is surprisingly heavy in her hand. She hates her father but in all the fear she's happy he's here. The military had come through a few hours before, telling everyone to evacuate. They didn't specify why. Her father, ever trusting, refused to leave. He was sure they were rounding people up, something about foreign interests. 

     “Lastly, don't give it to Cole,” he orders. “He doesn’t have the balls to use it.”

     Her father walks out to the front porch as Jean makes her way to her brother’s room. He’s sitting on the bed in his Slipknot shirt, his leg bouncing. She sits down next to him, hiding the gun in the back of her jeans. 

     “Did he tell you what’s happening?” Cole asks.

     “Just the same shit. Apparently the government’s been infiltrated by Chinese plants and they’re gonna bomb Boston or something. I don’t believe him.”

     “Then what were they here for?” he replies.

     Jean shrugs.

     “Do you think it’s cause of…?” he points upward, gesturing to the two suns that set hours ago.

     “I don’t know. Maybe.”

    Cole’s eyes are wide, like a deer in headlights. She’s reminded of the day their father took him hunting for his fourteenth birthday. He thought it would bring something out of him, that perhaps their father would finally catch a glimmer of himself in his eyes. Cole returned with a black eye and no buck. He couldn’t bring himself to shoot. That was two years ago now, but he still has the same look in his eyes he did back then.

     Their mother said he was sensitive. Their father said he was just soft. After the accident, there was no one left to argue with him.

     Jean pulls out her phone.

     “I found a new song last night,” she says, changing the topic. “Well it’s not new but you get what I mean.” She hits Play on All We Ever Wanted Was Everything, by Bauhaus. His eyes are still wide saucers, but as the song continues, his leg stops moving as much. 

      “I don’t want to be here,” he says quietly.

      “Nothing’s gonna happen. They’re probably just making a big deal of nothing.

     “No, that’s not what I-” he starts. “I don’t want to be here anymore. I miss mom.”

     “Where do you want to be?” she asks.

      “I don’t know. Florida? With Aunt Sarah?”

      She thinks for a moment. It seems to her that the world has already ended. Their madman father stands out front with a gun. The National Guard has told them to leave. Their neighbors have all fled town. There’s writing on the wall she’d have to be blind not to read.

      “Okay,” she replies, standing up.

     “What do you mean?”

     “Let’s go to Florida.”

     “Right now?”

     “Yeah,” she says. “Aunt Sarah will take us. Dad’s busy fighting a one man war against China. Why not?”

     “How are we gonna get there?”

     She shrugs.

     “We’ll figure it out.”

     “What about our stuff?” he asks.

     “What about it?” she asks. “No point being sentimental, come on.”

     Cole’s foot is tapping again. 

     “Cole,” she says. “How long do you want to live like this?”

____________________

June 13, 10:08 PM
     
     They step into the night, the air cool and still. Normally there’d be crickets or cicadas buzzing up a racket, but the backyard is silent. Beyond silent. 

     “I’ve got a couple hundred in cash,” she tells him as they cross their yard into the neighbor’s. “If we take the bus into Boston, we can take Amtrak south.”

     A sound punctuates the silence, a sort of hooting, like that of an owl. Jean glances around for its source, but comes up empty, so she keeps walking.

     “Is Amtrak still running,” Cole asks.

     “Yeah, why wouldn't they be?”

     “Because of the whole evacuation thing?”

     Jean shrugs.

     “I don't know. We'll see when we get there.”

     The sound comes again.

     Jean turns her head and sees a shape in the darkness, beyond the chain linked fence on the other end of their house. She can't make out much, only a silhouette and two violet, glowing dots. They're eyes, hanging in the air at hip height, reflective like a cat's. She wonders if it's a coyote, but they're rarely seen this close to the city. It blinks and skitters away, toward the front of the house. 

     “What are you looking at?” Cole asks.

     “Not sure,” she replies, walking faster now. “Let's go.”

     A gunshot echoes across the neighborhood. They hear a man scream. It takes a moment for them to recognize the voice, as they’ve only heard their father shout in anger. This is fear, then pain. Now, silence.

     Jean breaks into a sprint and Cole follows.

June 14, 01:06 AM

     It’s become apparent that the cataclysm reaches far beyond Bangor. Mark hoped it would be over after he crossed town and rejoined I-95, but even now after abandoning the city, occasional wrecks still pepper the wooded roadside, unattended by paramedics. He passes the border into New Hampshire, then into Massachusetts. Nothing changes. Names of cities are running through his head. New York. Philadelphia. Chicago. Boulder. He hopes to God it hasn’t reached Boulder.

     He hasn’t slept and his eyelids are growing heavy. He’s approaching Boston now, about twenty miles out. The highway bends east, cutting through the thick vegetation of the woods, then twists back around to the left and slips under an overpass. The road merges back onto the highway, heading south-west, and up ahead there’s a mass of cars clogging the road, beneath the glow of the streetlights. People are milling about the vehicles, talking to each other and sharing food. Military personnel walk up and down the side of the interstate with rifles, eyeing everyone carefully.

     He realizes that the line must stretch all the way into Boston, filled with people fleeing to the shelter of the city. The roadway on the other side of the median is walled off with orange barriers and cones, flanked on either side by two armed guards.

     Two children sit in the trunk of a minivan in the left lane, a girl and a boy, the door open and their feet dangling out over the back bumper. They eat chips out of a Ziploc bag as their parents share a cigarette around the driver’s side. Mark slows down and parks behind the van. He swings open the door and as he steps out, a soldier to the right of the road shouts.

     “Max occupancy!” he yells. “Turn back!”

     “My kid is in Colorado!” Mark replies. “I need to get through!”

     “No one’s passing through Boston! Anyone who enters Boston stays in Boston, and these folks right here are the last ones in.”

     “Where am I supposed to go?”

     “I don’t know sir. You can’t stay here.”

     Mark shakes his head and returns to the van. As he shuts the driver’s side door, the mother of the kids in the minivan, a stringy black-haired woman in jeans and a white t-shirt, runs over to his window. He rolls it down.

     “There’s a church,” she says between shaky breaths.  She has a strong New England accent. “On Federal Street in Salem. The east side of town is totally gone but last I heard the west side is still okay. They’re sheltering people there, in the basement. If you need to sleep for the night, they'll take you in.”

     “That's alright. I appreciate it but I can't stop.”

     “Well if you need food or water, they have provisions there.”

     “I'll keep it in mind, thank you.”

     “Stay safe,” she says. She turns and makes her way back to the car. 

     Mark puts the van in reverse, then pauses.

     “Hey,” he calls. “Can I borrow your phone for a minute?”

     “Yeah.”

     She runs back over and pulls her phone from her pocket, handing it through the window.

     Mark dials his wife's number.

     “C’Mon, c'mon, c'mon,” he mutters as he listens to the ringtone. “Pick up, pick up.”

     The guard's radio crackles and a man’s voice cuts through the static outside the van.

     “General, we have eyes on ULO-A13.”

     Another voice returns.

     “Light it up Davey.”

     A flurry of gunfire rings out through the forest in the distance as an automated voice says “I'm sorry, the person you are calling is not available. Goodbye.” 

     Mark hands the phone back.

     “Thank you.”

     It occurs to Mark that the soldier is doing him a favor. It would take days just to get into the city, days out in the open. Every person in each of those cars sees Boston as a safe haven, but Mark sees a buffet line. The gunfire continues and he looks over to the kids in the woman's minivan. 

     “You need to get out of here,” he says. “Tonight. It's not safe.”

     “There's nowhere else to go. Nothing’s left. The National Guard is here. This is the safest place for us,” she replies.

     “Have you seen them?” he asks.

     She shakes her head, but her eyes are wide. 

     “The military came. Started moving people out. We had the choice to stay but they said they weren't coming back if we did. Some people stayed. Some people crashed in the church. I just got the kids in the van and left,” she replies. “I don't even know what they look like, I just heard they're big.”

     The guns grow quieter, disappearing one by one. The guard’s radio crackles.

     “Davey, do you copy?” the general asks.
 
     David doesn't answer.

     The guard lifts the gun in Mark's direction.

     “Sir, if you don't turn around, I'll be obligated to use lethal force.

     Mark puts the van in reverse. As he backs up, he yells to the woman.

     “I've seen them. The National Guard can't stop what's coming. Get your kids out of here.”

      He takes I-95 back up about four miles. For a moment his eyelids slip closed. He sees Jane. She’s pregnant again, with Livvie, sitting on the couch, the light through the window forming a brilliant ring about her head, so bright he could hardly see the features of her face. At her feet lie seven serpents, writhing about the carpet and licking the air. They slither closer, their fangs poised to bite. 

     “Can you see them?” she asks.

     “Yes.”

     “They may bite me. They may not,” she says. “It’s their decision now.”

     The floor falls out from beneath them. The couch, the walls, the snakes, they all disappear. She stands above a blood moon in her white wedding dress. She holds Laura at her hip now. Stars decorate the deep black of the void, forming a crown about her head. The two suns appear from either side of her. Her dress appears as though it’s burning. She smiles.

     The suns grow brighter, until they become a pair of headlights. Mark veers to the right, narrowly missing the other car, which swings wide to the left and keeps driving toward Boston. Mark hits the brakes, nearly sliding off the road. The van screeches to a halt. 

     He takes a deep breath, rests his head against the steering wheel. Every part of him wants to keep going, find a way around Boston, but his body is betraying him. His head is still throbbing, and he fears he may have a concussion. He needs sleep.

      He rolls down the window and lights a cigarette. The singing echoes through the woods, joining the crickets.

      “Goddamn it,” he mutters as he turns the van back around.

     “I don’t want to do this,” Cole says as they crouch behind a parked car, his eyes still full of that fear. The fear of killing a deer.

     “Do you know how to hot-wire a car?” Jean asks.

     “No.”

     “Then how do you think we’re getting to Florida?”

     “I don’t know,” he says. “But there’s gotta be another way. This isn’t right”

     “No, it isn’t,” she agrees. “There is no right anymore. There’s us, and then there’s them. Whose side are you on?”

     Cole just stares at her.

     “Goddamn it, Cole! Would you fucking grow a pair?” She regrets her words as soon as they come out.

     “Okay,” he says. “I’ll do it.”

_____________________

June 14, 01:42 AM

     Salem is silent. Deathly silent. Yet, oddly enough, there’s nothing out of place. No crashes. No bodies. The streetlights stand straight, just as they did before. 

     He takes Boston Street southeast through town, eyeing the white and blue Colonial and Greek Revival houses. The lights are all out, the windows black, the paint peeling from parts of the wood. Out in the night somewhere, the silence is broken by some kind of bird call, like that of a loon or a mourning dove. 

     Salem is an easy town to get lost in. The streets all sprout out in random directions like spiderwebs, curving and bending into each other with no rhyme or reason. Mark has spent the last twenty minutes trying to find Federal Street, and the time he’s spending is making him nervous. Something in the air isn’t right.

     The bird call pierces through the night again, this time from somewhere farther.

     Someone appears from out of the darkness ahead, waving his arms in the air in an attempt to flag him down. He looks to be in his late teens to early twenties, wearing a Slipknot shirt and a pair of ripped jeans, a beanie atop his head. 

     “Stop the car!” he screams. “Please! My sister needs help!”

     Mark hits the brakes and sticks his head out through the window.

     “Get in!” he yells.

     The kid stops running, standing in the glow of the headlights. He shakes his head.

     “No, you don’t understand!” he says. “My sister’s hurt! She can’t walk! I can’t get her in the car on my own!”

    “Fuck,” he mutters. He considers just driving around him and leaving him to fend for himself, but as he stares at the kid’s tears glinting in the light of the van, he knows he can’t.

     He opens the door and steps out, leaving the van running.

     “Where is she?” he asks. The kid says nothing. He just sniffles, glancing between Mark and something to the left. Mark follows his eyes and finds a girl standing there, pointing a pistol at his chest. She’s about the same age, wearing a Thrasher t-shirt. Mark assumes that she’s the sister, and judging by the gun in her hand, she’s the eldest. Her eyes glare at him with determination, but her hand trembles a little. She’s never held a gun before, much less pointed it at someone.

      Mark raises his hands over his head.

     “I’m sorry,” the brother sobs. “I’m so sorry.”

     “You don’t have to do this,” he says calmly. “I can help you. My daughter’s in Colorado. I can give you a ride-”

     “We’re heading to Florida,” the sister replies. “Step away from the van.”

     Mark lowers his head and backs up. She keeps the gun pointed at him while her brother rushes to the passenger side and hops in. Mark stops once he’s made it to the back of the van.

    “Further,” she orders. 

    Mark takes another two steps back. The girl waits a moment, eyeing him carefully. She shuffles over to the driver’s side, the gun still pointed at his chest, then, once she’s sure he won’t try something, she jumps in, slams the door, and peels out. All Mark can do is watch as his only way home grows smaller and smaller and disappears at the next intersection.

     That bird call comes again, this time from the opposite direction. It sounds closer, just a block away. Mark starts walking, keeping a brisk pace. All that noise the kid made is only going to attract whatever else is out there. He doesn’t want to be there when it shows up.

     He reaches an intersection, the road splitting off in five directions. He reads the street signs, debating where to turn. Proctor. Bridge. Godhue. A shriek rings out from somewhere in the distance to his right, down Proctor Street. It sounds like a woman’s voice.

     “Please!” she screams. “Help me! Someone, God please!” 

     Mark looks down Proctor, trying to see who’s screaming. The street is empty, aside from a few cars parked at the curb. The scream comes again.

     “Please!”

     Mark keeps walking, continuing down Boston Street, his heart racing in his chest. His life depends on finding that church now. He can only hope he’s going in the right direction.

     The hooting comes again, this time from down the street behind him. He picks up the pace. 

     Another road splits off from Boston Street, on the left side. His body feels lighter as he reads the sign.

     ""Federal St.""

     Another bird call. This time ahead of him, from up Boston Street. It sounds closer. 

     Mark turns onto Federal, breaking into a light jog. The crickets are silent, the wind still. From out of the darkness, somewhere behind the brick and wooden houses, comes another scream.

     “Help me! Someone, God please!” 

     It’s the same voice, the same words and inflection too.

     The church is up ahead on the left, built of red brick and pointed upward toward the sky. A large cross adorns the peak of the roof. Gothic-style windows decorate the walls, lined with copper, turning green with oxidation. Mark crosses the lot and notices that the large wooden doors are wide open. He can smell nickel and as he gets closer, he sees dark stains smearing the wood. 

     Blood.

     The call comes from down the street, behind him. It’s too close now. He spins around, but the street is empty. He walks backwards, scanning the darkness for any movement. The scream returns, somewhere to his left of the road.

     “Please!” she shouts and it’s close enough that he should be able to see her but he can’t.

     Mark keeps backing up, glancing over his shoulder. Another call sounds out from the opposite direction, behind his back. He turns his head to look down the road, but there’s nothing to see. Time slows down and his stomach sinks into his gut as he realizes it’s over. Whatever is out here with him has him surrounded.

     There’s a sharp whistle.

     Mark jerks his head toward the sound.

     There’s someone standing in the doorway of a blue, two-story house across the street. He’s a black man, dressed in a white t-shirt and a pair of gym shorts, a beard covering his chin.

     “Walk toward me,” he says in a low voice, his eyes wide. “Slowly.”

     Mark takes careful steps toward the man, who glances from him over to something behind him. As he crosses the street, he hears another call from somewhere to his right.

     “Don’t turn around,” the man insists. “Just keep your eyes on me and keep walking.”

     Mark reaches the curb, and the man’s eyes widen further.

     “Run,” he orders.

     Mark breaks into a sprint. He can hear footsteps behind him, light and quick, clicking against the asphalt. There’s a new sound now, a guttural screeching that turns more into a howl as it gets closer behind him. Mark dives into the house and the man tries to throw the door shut, but something slams into it, nearly knocking him over. He holds fast, pushing against the force of the animal. A pale, white hand reaches around the side, with three bony, scaled fingers ending in curved, pointed black claws. Mark jumps to his feet and rams the door beside the other man, crushing the creature’s fingers against the doorpost. It screams in pain, pushing back against them until it can free its hand. They give the door one last push, and it shuts with a loud bang. 

     Both men remain a moment, panting as Mark locks the door. On the other side, the animal lets out another loon-like cry, followed by the clicking of its feet walking away. 

     “Pleasure to meet you,” the man says at last, reaching out for a handshake. “I’m Frank.”

___________________

June 14, 02:32 AM

     The house is full. Scattered through the dark rooms of Frank’s house are eight other survivors. Mark sits on a recliner beside the bay windows, the blinds drawn. All he had to do was keep driving. He could have made it to Connecticut by now had he just kept fucking driving. 

     Frank sits on the floor between the TV and the coffee table. Delilah, a narrow, bony brunette woman, around the age of thirty, lays curled up on the couch across from him, sweating and shivering under a blanket. A teenaged girl named Isabel sits to her left in a grey sweater, over top of a plaid shirt, her black curls draped over her shoulders. Her Uncle, Bruno, a grizzled man with a patchy grey beard sits on the armrest beside her. All of them dwell in an uneasy quiet, glancing toward the covered windows as though something might break in.

     The woman they’d been hearing all night screams again from somewhere out in front of the house and everyone jumps.

     “Help me! Someone, God please!”

     Isabel stands up.

     “Ignore it,” Frank says. “She’s already dead.”

     Isabel twists toward him, her face wrinkled with disgust.

     “How can you say that?” she asks. “We can still help her!”

     “You’re misunderstanding,” he says calmly.

     Isabel starts toward the door, but her uncle grabs her hand.

     “It’s not her, sweetheart,” Bruno says quietly. “She’s gone. It’s one of those things. They took her voice.”

     Isabel looks to her uncle, then back to the window. She sits down, tears welling up in her eyes. 

     “You’d think they’d be full by now,” Bruno mutters. “I mean how many people were in that church?”

     Frank shakes his head.

     “You’d have to ask Margaret,” he replies. “She saw it all happen.”

     “Why isn’t the military here?” Bruno asks, to no one in particular. 

     “They’re overrun,” Mark answers. The others turn in his direction, surprised to hear him say anything after so long. “They only guard the cities now, and Boston isn’t taking anyone else in.”

     “How’s that possible?” Bruno asks. “They’re fast, but they’re small. Nothing the army couldn’t pop in the head. I mean c’mon, my cousin Leo’s fat pit bull could kill one of them, couldn’t she, Izzy?”

     Isabel says nothing, her eyes watering.

     “They get bigger than that,” Mark replies. “The first one I saw was the size of my Kenworth, tore through everyone on the highway before we even knew what was happening. The second one was bigger than this house.”

     “Jesus,” Frank mutters.

     No one says anything. Another bird cry resounds from outside.

     Delilah groans, balling herself up tighter. Whatever she’s sick with, it’s eating through her. 

     Her boyfriend, a lanky man with a shaved head and a blondish-brown goatee, walks in from the hall to the right of the house, finally returning from the bathroom upstairs. A silver cross dangles from his neck over a white tank top, a tattoo of an eagle on his left shoulder, gripping an ace of spades in its talons. Little red marks and bruises cover the pale skin on the inside of his forearms, and his eyes twitch back and forth like an anxious animal. 

     He leans over the back of the couch and lays his hand on Delilah’s shoulder.

     “Hey baby,” he coos. “How you feelin’?”

     “Like shit, Vic,” she moans. “You’re not sick?”

     “Yeah baby, but I can handle it better. It don’t hurt like it used to.”

     “Bullshit,” she mutters, clenching her eyes shut with another swell of pain.

     Vic scoffs.

     “You just mad cause you hurting,” he whispers. He leans in closer. “So I’ma choose not to hear that.” He stands up and makes his way around to Frank. “Thank you sir,” he says, shaking his hand. “I really appreciate you letting us stay here.”

     “Of course,” Frank replies with a look of concern. “Is she okay, man?”

     “Yeah, yeah. She’ll be ‘aight. Just feelin’ a little under the weather.” Vic pushes Delilah’s feet in a bit and sits down on the left end of the couch. She groans in pain. “So what are we talkin’ about?”

     “How we’re all gonna die,” Isabel replies.

     “Hey,” Bruno cuts in. “Don’t talk like that. Someone will come for us. We just have to wait.”

     “Tio,” she says quietly. “Mark already said it. No one’s coming for us. Boston won’t let us in.”

     “Then we’ll try New York, or Philly, or-or Chicago.”

     “Milo’s dead,” she says.

     “What’s that?”

     “Leo’s dog. We ran there when everything went down. That’s where me and dad split up. They killed him. They killed the dog.”

      “Well they’re not gonna get you. Not while I’m here,” Bruno insists. “And that’s a promise. I’d burn in Hell before I let them take you.”

     Isabel’s eyes are full of doubt, but she leans her head against Bruno’s arm.

     “Thank you, Tio.”

     “That’s touching, that’s touching,” Vic says, his leg bouncing up and down like a little kid, wiping his nose with the back of his hand. “So Frank, what’s our plan?”

     “What do you mean?” Frank replies.

     “Well you know.” He gestures to the walls around them. “Getting out of here alive.”

     Frank shrugs, shaking his head. 

     “Hunker down. Hope for the best,” he answers. “That’s all we can do.”

     Another woman screams outside, from down the street.

     “Get away! Get the fuck away from me!”

     Isabel stands up.

     “Izzy,” Bruno starts.

     “That one’s real,” she replies.

     “It’s not, I’m telling you-”

     “No Tio, I’m telling you this one’s different.”

     She starts toward the door again. Frank stands up.

     “Isabel, stop,” he says. She turns back. “I’ll look.”

     Frank walks over to the window and peaks out through the blinds. A deafening bang rings out.

     “I’ll be damned,” he mutters as he makes his way to the door.

     “What is it?” Vic asks.

     Frank goes around the corner, and Mark hears the front door open. Everyone stirs, preparing to flee at any moment.

     “Run! Run! Come on!” Frank yells. There’s another bang, then shoes thudding against the floorboards inside. The door slams.

     Frank walks in, followed by two teenagers, one a boy in a Slipknot shirt, and the other a girl in a Thrasher shirt. Mark stares at them and they meet his eyes. He almost wants to laugh.

(Monetize and editing is okay just give credit where it's due thanks.),"*Setting: Flashy Catchy music plays on the game show, the host is being announced.*

**Darling Dandy**: Welcome! Welcome! I’m your Host, Darling Dandy and you are watching the number one game show on the True Kidnapping Live Network! \**cheers and applauses\** Let us meet our lucky Player of the day, shall we? She is a young college girl who recently moved here about two months ago and has a lovely family with a dog named Bo. *\*audiences goes aw when seeing a photo\** She has lovely brown hair that she keeps tied up in a braid most days and loves running as her forum of daily exercising. She would love to be a teacher or work with small animals someday. A true country girl who would describe herself as a shy girl at first but if very loyal to her friends let us give her big round of applause to our Player of the day!*\*cheers and jeers\**

**Player 1 (quiet tone)**: Thank you, Mr. Darling Dandy. It’s nice to be here.

**DD**: Please Call me Dandy or Dan. \**laughs\**

**Player 1**: \**blushes and shy*\* Okay if that’s what you would like me to do.

**DD**: \**to audience*\*: Isn’t she great. I think she needs some more encouragement people. Give her another round \**more clapping\** Okay now my Dear. You know how this game works but for the people at home I’ll explain it to them. You have in your hand questions that you are going to ask these three people over there. Now you can’t see them. Based on how they answer your questions you are going to chose one of them to be your very own yandere to stalk, kidnap, or whatever it is you crazy kids do these days. \**laughs*\* Are you ready to play the game? Yeah? Then it’s time. It’s time to PICK YOUR YANDERE! *\*gameshow music plays then goes to player 1\**

**Player 1**: Yandere Number One. If I was getting coffee and you saw me getting two cups instead of one, what would you do?

**YN1**: Well darling, I know you would never get coffee as you are a tea drinker. Albeit, to indulge your question \***if**\* you were getting two cups of coffee, I would know that was code for you getting another cup for someone else, like a special person in your life. And that someone else would have to be me. I wouldn’t let you get coffee for anyone else.

**DD**: Oooh, sounds like the jealous type over here. Let’s go on to next one, shall we?

**Player 1**: Okay Mr. Dandy. Hmm…Yandere Number Two. If I was out running and sprained my ankle, what would you do?

**YN2**: Spain your ankle? My god, that is a terrible thought to even think about my love. You would need better shoes and to know the area you are running around better. Best to make sure you only then ran on a treadmill where you could be always view for your safely, Plus it is not like you need to be running anyway. You wouldn’t need to run if you chose me, I would keep you safe always, plus I would carry you in my arms so you wouldn’t have to limp anywhere if that were to happen.

**DD**: D’awww…what a gentleman, creepy but sweet. Am I right or am I right audience? *\*laughter from the audience\**  And lastly what do you have to ask for our last challenger?

**Player 1**: Yandere Number Three: What would you do on a first date with me?

**YN3:** Why, anything and everything you would want to do. I know you love the ocean, so I want to take you to the aquarium or even to the beach itself, but only if you promise to stay close to me. I-I wouldn’t want you to wonder off now *\*chuckles*\* Or maybe we could just stay at home and watch a movie, that way I know you are safe and comfortable, an-and I would be able to prepare all your favorite foods. I-I mean, if that was what you would like to do that is.

**DD**: Sounds like a wonderful housewife they would be. Okay my Dear, now do you have any other questions you would like to ask the yanderes here before you make a choice?

**Player 1**: Oh yes. Hmm this goes for all three of them. If you kidnap me and I was to escape from you, how would you react?

**YN1:** I would go insane without you don’t you realize that….

**YN2**: You wouldn’t dare, you have a sprain ankle remember?

**YN3**: Darling, why would you do that? It wouldn’t be safe away from me.

**DD:** Oh no! Looks like we got ourselves some **REAL** potential lovesick contenders. I’m glad I don’t have to make this choice, but you do my Dear, so who are you going to choose?

**Player 1**: **\******shy tone***\* Well…I don’t know Mr. Dandy, they all sound like they would be so attentive to my needs.

**DD**: Aww yes, but the show is that you pick just one. So, who is it going to be?

**Player 1**: Well..hmm..maybe. Yandere number..hmm I--

**DD**: Time is money my Dear.

**YN2**: Let her be.

**YN1:** She can think for herself don’t rush her.

**YN3**: She will make the right choice, just let her be. It’s nervous being under lights and in front of a camera.

**DD**: Well damn, I guess you all are right, but really my lovely Dear, who do you pick?

**Player 1**: I guess, hmm. I would like to know more about number 3?

**DD**: Oh great choice! Let’s see who you didn’t choose now! Yandere Number 1 was your Basita! Haha! Guess you won’t be getting your tea there anytime soon! Thank you for coming and please exit stage left. *\*laughter*\* Security make sure you are on call and ready now. Next up, Yandere Number 2 was your classmate! Ouch that’s got to sting! You can exit stage left as well thank you! Now my Dear, are you ready to see who you pick? *\*pause\** It’s Yandere Number 3! Your….hmm…ohh…hmm…it seems that I don’t have the card here.

**YN3**: *\*footsteps*\* As I said, give her time and she would pick the right choice. Now if you don’t mind, I will take her off your hands, and don’t you **ever** call her your Dear again. For she is mine.

So far, I've been using the included pressurized partafilter, and the espresso drinks have been very good! But I would like to take my espresso-making to the next level by grinding my own coffee beans instead of buying them pre-ground.

I've bought all of the espresso enthusiast accessories already (bottomless portafilter, dosing ring, WDT tool, scale, puck screen, tamper, etc). The last thing I need is the coffee grinder.

My budget is around $300, and I've narrowed it between the [DF 54 v3](https://dfgrinders.com/products/df54-coffee-grinder?variant=47359838257369) and the [Varia VS3](https://www.variabrewing.com/products/varia-vs3-grinder). Does anyone have any pros are cons between the two, or any input on which one I should get? I'm a novice when it comes to espresso making and the hobby.

I also see that the[ Varia VS4](https://www.variabrewing.com/collections/vs4/products/varia-vs4-grinder) just came out, but it is pushing $500. Would it be worth spending the extra $200 to upgrade to this one?

1pmvefh,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1pmvefh/costa_rica_review_nayara_tended_camps_and_nekajui/,"Costa Rica Review - Nayara Tended Camps and Nekajui Peninsula Papagayo, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve","We recently traveled to Costa Rica via Liberia, CR. We rented a car, and because we had a red eye, we stayed overnight at the El Mangrove. It was unmemorable, so I won't cover it here. If you're renting a car, make sure you Google the car insurance and rental policies in CR so you aren't caught off guard.

We set out around 11 AM and found the drive pretty reasonable. The roads were comfortable and had far fewer potholes than those in Seattle. The only issue with the roads is that work trucks drive far too slowly for your taste. This means you have to pass cars on a two-lane road. There are not many places to do that, so if you drive with patience, you will be much better off.  The freedom that having a car gave us is very worth it.

All the activities we did were booked by the hotel, but with a rental car, you could book them independently. The hotel tours all included transportation.

Nayara Tented Camp was absolutely perfect. Each tent is very private with its own hot springs pool. You can swim with or without swimwear. Kids are allowed at the Tented camp, but it was not a concern. We could not hear any of the other tents. The only issue with kids was at one restaurant.  Of the three properties, springs, garden, and tented, tended has the best view since it sits at the top.

The food was fine. We did splurge on the last night and went to their tasting menu restaurant, which was very good. Menu Here: [https://23160175.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/23160175/NCR%20Menus/Amor%20Loco%20Nuevo%20Ingl%C3%A9s.pdf](https://23160175.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/23160175/NCR%20Menus/Amor%20Loco%20Nuevo%20Ingl%C3%A9s.pdf) Since we had a rental car, we did go to La Fortuna a few times to get lunch. It was nice to get around on our own.

The staff were all amazing and they even had a drink with the manager night. We met with Carolina to complain about the poor internet and it seems they are going to be fixing their wifi and internet speeds in Jan 2026. They are also adding online chat options for requesting things, like golf carts. The hills are no joke there. It was 80 feet up to breakfast and we were nearly at the top already. It also required walking across a hanging bridge to get there.

All these pictures were from within the property, including the sloth! I highly recommend sky adventures for ziplining!

Nekajui was kind of a uh mind fuck after Nayara. It is a very, very different experience. We were very lucky to get a huge upgrade from the base room to a one-bedroom suite with a pool and an outdoor shower. The room is so beautiful. It was by far the best room we ever stayed at. When you check in, you are provided a ""friend"" or a butter with Whats up access.

They said dinner reservations are required ,which can be booked via your ""friend."" We were wild and just winged it a few times, but if you want to go to Coopers Bar, you need reservations. The food was similar to Nayara with a higher price tag. $300 for 2 for dinner was standard. Cocktails are $20-23 dollars. The 8 ounces of coffee beans that are roasted on the property to take home were $60 a bag!!!!! A 2-shot Americano was $16. Insanity.

The first night made it pretty clear that we were no longer in the rainforest. Everyone is dressed up for dinner. We were not... ever. This resort is made for folks who don't want to leave the property and have the luggage space for multiple outfits in a day. Just leaving Papagayo was a 20-minute drive to the first gate. There were three gates to get into Nekajui.

The activities that are offered by the hotel seem to be a mix of those fulfilled by the hotel, a tour provider within Papagayo that all the resorts use, and a few external. The zipline was provided by the Papagayo tour company and it was meh. My husband did love the ropes course, though.

This is the only place that I got eaten by mosquitoes, so make sure you are prepared.

I am not sure this is the resort for us, but I imagine some folks here would love it.

1pmvbyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pmvbyj/multiple_unexpected_turn_of_events_threatened_my/,"Multiple unexpected turn of events threatened my sobriety today but I stood strong. If I could, you can too!","Went out for brunch with a girl I have dated a few times today. We've only been talking for about six weeks so I haven't explained the full extent of my alcohol issues to her - she's not a big drinker, so it hasn't really been a glaring problem. I've just been telling her I'm cutting back on drinking and trying not to drink in December. The dynamic has been perfectly fine. 

Today, we get to a restaurant that neither of us thought we needed a reservation for and surprise surprise, there was a 40-minute wait....unless, we wanted to sit at the bar. Not ideal, I thought, with all the alcohol staring us in the face, but not the end of the world either. I expected her to get a drink with the implication sitting right there but she ordered a coffee like I did. I wouldn't have been triggered if she got a drink or two, but I was happy to avoid it altogether. 

Then...""Santa Claus"" comes marching through the restaurant and shortly after the bartender announces to everyone seated that ""Santa ordered a round for everyone at the bar."" Guy set a couple of shots of whiskey in front of myself and my date. I won't lie, the lizard braining was strong for a second, and I had a thought to say fuck it, do the shot, maybe order a drink after that and then whatever, see where it goes. Maybe I stop drinking after the date, maybe I don't. Butttt, I played the tape forward and thought about how shitty Monday morning me would feel to break a legit promise to myself to do a Dry December (and possibly beyond). My date turned to me and said ""you're not doing yours?"" in a non-judgmental way, and I replied with ""nah, I'm good."" She did her shot, at which point I asked if she wanted mine as well lol. Being the normie she is, she declined and handed it to a girl sitting to her right at the bar. 

And that was it, finished our meals, had a fun time walking around the city after that. In about a dozen other ""attempts"" at sobriety, that would have been more than enough of a cue for me to say fuck it and at least snap a multi-day streak. More than likely, it would have started a blackout binge that would have - at the very least - resulted in me feeling like dog shit for work Monday morning, but likelier would have led to varying degrees of other consequences. Because I have more than enough evidence to know that I am not a very good person when I'm wasted. I'd probably still be drinking right now, tbh! Happy I'm not, happy I passed that test with flying colors and I want to say that If I of ALL PEOPLE could stay true to myself in the face of those unforeseen events, you can too! IWNDWYT.

So, it’s my first year composting and I live on a quarter acre in central Atlanta, Georgia. We’ve got a cold snap hitting tonight and I hadn’t gotten my compost warm enough to keep it from freezing so I have made some last minute decisions that may have been a combination of unnecessary and/or ill advised, so I’d love your opinions and advice. 

My setup: basic dual chambered, above ground, Amazon-grade spinner bin

Contents: mostly produce scraps, coffee grounds, and egg shells for the wet content. Brown content is typically shredded cardboard, paper, and dried leaves. 

Worms: I bought some red wigglers earlier this summer and dug up some earthworms from my garden to place inside. They’ve really thrived. I see lots of other bugs in warm weather (roly polies, fly larvae, occasional carpenter ants) but since it’s cooler now it’s just the worms. 

Current composting stage: we’re \*almost\* there— starting to resemble soil, but still has some chunks of this n that that haven’t broken down yet. 

The issue: I really biffed getting the temperature up before things started getting cold. You can stick your hand inside the bin and it feels kinda room-temperature-warm, but not nearly enough to keep it from freezing when things drop to 17F tonight and over the next couple nights. 

So, I scooped a good portion into a Lowe’s 5 gallon bucket and brought it inside to keep some of the worms alive. 

I know worms die and they reproduce pretty readily, but I don’t want them all to get nuked just because I didn’t winter-proof my bin in time. 

So anywho, here I sit on my sofa, while some of my compost and worms are sitting in my living room, in a hot pink Lowe’s bucket, taking in the festive scenery that is my Christmas tree. 

So basically, if I’m being a complete moron, it’s okay to tell me (hopefully nicely). My intention is to let them get nice and warm and hopefully once the cold snap passes I can put them back into GenPop outside. 

But if there is some legitimacy to this whim I’ve followed, I have a bonus question: what would happen if I put the bucket over top of a heat vent? It would accelerate the composting, yeah? If I added extra browns and stirred it up and sat it on a heat vent, could it get the core temp up enough that I count jump start the bin when I dump it back outside into the bin when it’s warmer? 

I’m only intending on keeping them indoors for a few days. Bonus pic of my worms enjoying the Christmas tree. ",6,1765763265.0,composting,5,0.8,False
1pmv8ev,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmv8ev,Figured out a placement fix (mobile),"My college age daughter got me playing Stardew when she came home over the summer.  Finally got to a point where I wanted to start decorating the farm more and as I was going along I tried placing some Junimo plants and end tables to create evergreen hedges.  Since I play on mobile it is just tap to place on any green highlighted tile but the end tables would not place outside even on green tiles.  Got frustrated and searched getting old Reddit threads about its not possible on mobile.  Bummer.

Later I tried making a diorama for Christmas tree and gifts (junimo bundles) that worked fine in the house but the bundles would not place outside.  This time I remembered a trick I had read that on mobile if you wanted to place an inventory item, like a coffee cup, on a table you had to switch controls to “Joystick and buttons” to place the item because tapping the table while holding the item didn’t do anything like it it does with decorations.  Swapped the controller and it let me place the Junimo bundles just fine.  Worked for the end tables too.  Very happy because this really opens up a lot more opportunities for making outdoor parks and scenes.

So, really hope this helps any other mobile players that may have been struggling with this.  ",4,1765763241.0,StardewValley,0,0.84,False
1pmv866,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1pmv866/a_night_i_still_cant_explain/,A Night I Still Can’t Explain,"*Note: English is not my native language. I used a ""programm"" to help improve and clarify this text, but the story itself is completely true and written by me.*

I want to share a story that has stayed with me for years. This is not about ghosts or anything supernatural. It’s about something strange that I still can’t explain, and that sometimes keeps me awake at night thinking about it.

A bit about me:  
I’m male, from Germany, and I live in a mostly rural area. Not many mountains or forests, mostly fields and farmland, small streams, and often very clear night skies. There are a few wind turbines around as well.

I was about 25 years old when this happened. I was driving home from a friend’s place late in the evening, around 11:30 PM or midnight. It was a clear, cool autumn night. For at least ten minutes, I hadn’t seen a single car coming toward me, and there was none behind me either. Even though the area is rural, there is a nearby highway exit. It’s very unusual for that area to be this empty at night.

That was the first moment I felt slightly uncomfortable. Not scared—just uneasy. I shook it off and kept driving.

About two minutes later, I noticed something in a field next to the road:  
A car. It was upside down, roughly 100 meters away from the road.

I immediately stopped, turned on my hazard lights, and took out my phone to call emergency services. I got out of my car and walked toward the vehicle using my phone’s flashlight. It was an old dark green VW Golf Mk4. One wheel was completely torn off and lying somewhere in the field.

I shined the light into the interior, preparing myself for the worst.  
But there was no one inside. No person. No body. Just some blood on the steering wheel.

I called emergency services and explained the situation. The operator asked the usual questions and told me to go back to my car and keep my hazard lights on so the responders could find me. She said they would be there within five minutes. Then she hung up.

For context: the next town, with a highway exit, police, and ambulances, was very close.

**How I felt during all this:**

From the moment I stepped out of my car, I felt an intense and unfamiliar sensation in my chest. Pressure. Mild pain. A strange inner tension. Breathing felt harder. I had never experienced anything like this before.

I’m 1.90 m tall, broad-built, around 110 kg, physically active, and not easily scared. I’ve never considered myself an anxious person.  
But there, that night, I was scared. And I still don’t know why.

Everything in my body told me: *Get back into your car and leave.*  
But I wanted to help. What if someone was injured? So I ignored my instinct.

Another strange thing:  
There were no sounds. No wind. No birds. No frogs, even though there’s a river nearby. No insects. Nothing at all.

And despite the clear night, there were no stars in the sky.

Most of these details only really registered once I was sitting back in my car, waiting for help to arrive.

Ten minutes passed—nothing.  
Twenty minutes—still nothing.  
Thirty minutes—no ambulance, no police, no passing cars.

The pressure in my chest became unbearable. Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore and drove away.

During that entire time, not a single vehicle passed me.

When I reached the next town, I stopped at a gas station. I desperately needed a coffee—and more importantly, to see another human being. I felt relieved just talking to someone.

I asked the woman behind the counter if any emergency vehicles had driven past. She said no, and even mentioned that there hadn’t been any traffic at all for about 30 minutes, which she also found strange but then brushed off.

I drank my coffee, drove home, went to bed, and fell asleep.

The next morning, the night still wouldn’t leave my mind. So I put on my shoes and drove back to the accident site.

There was nothing there.  
No car.  
No debris.  
No tire tracks.  
Nothing.

The car had been upside down and far out in the field—it should have left clear traces.

I checked my phone. There was no record of the emergency call. No call history at all. As if I had never made it.

Back home, I remembered something: the night before, I had put my shoes in the bathtub to clean them because they were covered in mud.  
They were still there. Dirty. Covered in dried mud.

I checked local news reports.  
Nothing. No accident. No mention of anything.

To this day, I can’t explain what happened that night.

Sometimes I lie awake and wonder:

* What if I had waited longer?
* Should I have called emergency services again?
* Why was the feeling in my chest so intense?
* Why were there no stars?
* Why was everything so silent?

Maybe I dreamed it all.  
But then—why were my muddy shoes in the bathtub?

Either way, thank you for reading.

We were budget travelers traveling as often for as cheap as we could and that was how we got AMEX stack AND Chase SR.

As we enter our 30s with a bit better financial situation, we are looking to travel less but better. However, we don't want more than 1k in annual fees unless we find the benefits easy to integrate into our lives. The recent perks of both AMEX Plat and CSR can be difficult to manage to get your full moneys worth. Before we were just tracking spend categories now we also have to make sure we are using monthly/bi annual credits? The resy credit makes us eat at places we don't care for, we don't like Saks, we like netflix for streaming and we make coffee at home. We like travel benefits and status cards with good transfer power but those usually involve having to go all in on an airline/hotel brand. We also would like low annual fee card with great points potential that can be used with the status.

We are out of Boston so best with Logan (currently Delta lounge and Chase lounge but Jet Blue and Centurion coming soon). So any insight you have on going all in on Delta, let us know as we have our Jetblue experience and love Jetblue but don't see the value in the new card until the lounge is open. We also don't totally understand using the jetblue/delta cards to earn status.

We are looking to travel to Europe, Asia, Australia, Domestically (USA) and the Caribbean 3ish times a year moving forward with occasional hotel stays for local weddings/events and each with 1-2 work trips a year.

A new girl joined my group that is very nice & cool. She hangs out with girls from another group, which I dont see very often due to different schedules. In this group, there is a girl that I really like, lets call her F & there are a few occassions that I hope she feels the same. We've met through this common girl we know, so she knows me & we also follow each other in socials. Here is a breakdown of the events in chronological order:

1) In a lesson, my group & F's group were together. F had a book with a disney princess on it, which I noticed. I commented in a funny but cool way about it, & she bantered with me about it back & forth. 

2) I was with 2 friends of mine in a hang out spot for a coffee. 2 tables to my left, F was sitting there with her friends. At some point, a person sitting next to me, tapped me in the shoulder & said: ""hey man, this girl wants to know where you' re from"". I look & the girl he talked about was F, giggling in a funny way, lets say. I didnt say anything, cause maybe she was joking, so I just laughed too & continued my conversation.

3) Before a morning lesson, we all sat in a corridor waiting for the prof. to arrive. I sat with my group & in front of me sat F with her friend from my group. When she sat she looked at me & together with her friend, F said ""Good morning, wont you say hello to us?"" In the same way when we bantered about her book. So I responded in a smart way & again we bantered for like 2 minutea, before she left for a separate room

4) In a lecture, while I was sitting down, I noticed F standing in a wall to my left around 6m distance from me. So I looked towards, her way & she saw me, smiled & waved her hand in a hello gesture. I did the same to her. After a while, I kept looking towards her. At some point, she was talking to her friend in her ear, & at that point I looked at her. Our gazes again found each other & she continued speaking to her friend, while keeping eye contact for a good amount of lets say 15s. 

Now, these are very minor events, maybe they dont mean anything. So, in your opinion, is there a posaibility she is interested to me? Should I maybe talk w/ her through the phone to keep touch or should I talk to her in person after the Christmas break (because we all leave now)?",1,1765763024.0,Crushes,2,1.0,False

1pmv34a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pmv34a/a_fly_on_the_wall/,A Fly On The Wall,"I hardly want to sleep anymore. I'm so tired that I want to die. I remember the good days. My head on a pillow after a hot shower. Sleep hitting almost instantly.

It's been a talent I've always had. I even bragged about it, at a time.

Well now, it's my hell. Especially now, trying to stay up. Trying to postpone it. If I just lay down, I'll be out.

Why did it start? Damned if I know. I just want it to end. I don't use electronics before bed. No screens. I don't eat less than an hour before bed. I shower every night. I read a book. Something boring like philosophy or whatever. Something to make the lights go out. Boy, they do.

Within an hour my eyes are drooping and now I lay me down to sleep.

I used to love to sleep. I did it all the time. Even during the day I had designated napping periods and a set bedtime at night. I take my sleep schedule seriously, sue me. Actually, right now just kill me.

They aren't nightmares. I know what you're thinking, no they aren't. Every time it happens I'm there. The second my head hits that blissful embrace of the pillow, the demons start heating the pitchforks to poke me all night.

And suddenly, it's like I'm up again. I'm sitting on someone's couch, someone real. At someone's dinner table, someone real. In their bed with them, really. Too close for comfort, really. Watching them.

And it's different each time. Someone new. Like I'm watching a movie that I'm inside of, but I'm that fly on the wall no one notices even though it's right in front of them.

And they're all getting slaughtered.

There I am, sitting in the La-Z-Boy of some poor old biddy and geezer's home. The carpet is so soft. The recliner smells like old person sweat and cheese. The lightbulbs are all aged and yellow. Just bright enough to see but not very clearly.
In front of me is a TV. Beside me is a couch with an old woman eating peanuts out of a bowl, not looking at the TV. I hear every crunch and crackle like a grinding gear as she chews. I hear and see everything in 4D. Her husband sits beside her, staring at the tube, his foot tapping the floor before he gets up.

He grunts out, raspy, ""I need a smoke.""

""Those'll kill you, you know,"" the old woman says.

There's a door to the left of the TV that I keep looking at. One of those sliding doors that go into the wall. It's all the way open. The open blackness yawns like the maw of a blasphemer.

Because what comes through is unholy.

The old man is slammed into the side of the wall on the opposite side. I don't see him yet but know what is happening from the noise. He falls to the ground, seizing violently, slamming into everything breakable in the room. His wife at his side, screaming. Peanuts and cigarettes flying everywhere. Me unable to move and he finally stops. He looks up once at his wife.

""Please, Edith. Just kiss me one more time...""

Confused and afraid, she does. Then they embrace and their lips envelop together. The smacks and slurps of wet flesh slapping together, drool dripping down both of their faces, tongues doing secret hand shakes. His hand still clutching the pack of cigarettes. The wife wipes her mouth and looks at him.

""What...honey, what was that for?""

That's when his face opened up.

I used to work at a pigeon hatchery. We sold the birds to farms and hunting camps for dog training. I don't know if you've seen a stillborn squab inside of its egg after you pull back the fleshy layer and see it curled up in there, all red and lumped together like a deformed worm drenched in grenadine and sprinkled with flecks of wood shavings. That's kind of what it looked like.

It happened in maybe five seconds at most. All of the skin and bones of his face spread open. Like an eye dilating all the way. Except inside was something like red mud mixed with meat which landed directly on her face and into her still open mouth.

A final kiss goodbye.

The woman spasming and writhing in disgust. Spitting and coughing and retching. Me wishing I could do the same. She scrambles, her pink face whipping across the room for an attacker. Her making this low mule's moan over and over and over. Backing up, up, up. She didn't see the coffee table and lands on her side. I hear an audible pop and a shallow gasp.

And then I'm out.

Like the fade out of a movie scene, the curtains close and I'm pulled into the murky blackness and back into something like sleep. The rest of the night uninterrupted.

Now I lay me down to sleep.

But it's not a restful sleep. It's a long, tormented, sweaty, hot sleep that wakes me up feeling like I've slept for days on end and with a migraine that would make a priest put a couple bucks in the swear jar.

Racking through my brain. Telling myself it was a dream. Still smelling the hot, squirming squab of meat.

I shower every morning too. Not only because of the sweat, migraine and piss, but also the blood. My nostrils feel like someone stuck a Ticonderoga pencil in each one up to the R.

No, I didn't hit my face. No, I'm not sick. No, I'm not going to the fucking doctor. I don't have health insurance and I quite literally cannot afford it.

Every morning is like this. The smell of freshly opened organs never goes away. A hot, stinging smell. It gets worse the more this happens. Like the smell is decaying in my airways and each morning, a fresh layer is smoothly applied. It hurts to breathe, to eat, to swallow, cough, sneeze. The outsides of my nose are scabby from wiping the droplets so much, tearing raw each time.

Each night again is the same but different.

This time it's a wife and kids cowering in the corner while the father is beat and maimed in front of them by a home intruder that none of us can see. Him screaming at them over, and over:

""I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I can't help it! I NEED--""

Meanwhile, I hang by one hand from the ceiling fan. Just checkin' out the scenery.

Another, I'm at the foot of someone's bed in the leapfrog position. Their feet stuck out of the comforter and suddenly beginning to silently convulse, running in place for a moment like a shot hog, while a voice travels under the door.

""Tom?""

In response, the bump on the far end of the bed begins to stain, and spread, and leak. A river of blood flows from both sides and some of it gets on me.

Should've kept his feet under the blanket.

And again, now I'm on a dresser, looking down as a man goes to open the drawers. He takes out a box. An envelope. A lot of cash. Reaches in his pocket and puts another wad of it in the envelope as well. A woman joins him and looks inside, impressed. They both laugh and tell each other what they're going to do with it before stopping to look down, each at their own torso, and begin to strip. Something is moving. Something inside them. They scream, they cry, their ribs burst out of them as they fall face down stone dead and the ribs flap on either side of them like little wings.

They don't fly far at all. Their little wings elevate them slightly but the limp limbs and faces just drag on the floor. They fly in circles in opposite directions of each other around their envelope and spilled pile of cash, leaving a twin snail trail of blood as they do.

And every time its me who has to see.

It's been three days now that I haven't slept. I'm trying to make sense of it. I don't want it to happen again. I don't wanna see it again. I don't watch the news. I don't go out anymore.

I don't wanna sleep. But it's so late and I'm so tired. I have to. I don't understand it. I need a drink. I need a lot of drink.

Maybe that'll be the cure. I'll get wasted. Too wasted for it to happen. Just black out until tomorrow. Like old times.

My hand on the bottle. Lifting to take a long, glorious swig. But suddenly my head hurts again, so very bad. A migraine tearing through my head like a hot needle of poison and my nose starts bleeding.

Not again. 

I lose my footing and collapse to the floor crying, naked and screaming like the day I was born.

And I feel the slight tickle as a fly lands on my foot.

1pmv2d4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmv2d4,The weight of time,"Thursday, one of my coworkers was having a bad day/week. Having recently been waxing nostalgic, I went looking for just the thing to at least momentarily cheer her up: A picture of an old artwork of mine. Looking through thousands of pictures to find it, I realized that 2011 was a fantastic year. It was so full of activity, creativity and potential.  My daily walk on the dunes, volunteering in the classrooms 10 hrs a week, Working at surfrider running workshops and educating and coordinating volunteers, Surfing as often as possible (over the Mariana trench where the great whites dwell) Primus at Berkley, the kids in ice hockey, Swim lessons. Sunsets over the pacific. Gregwas not yet traveling 6 months out of the year on an erratic and spontaneous schedule so he is home for the most part. Greg's trip to nicaragua for a coffee origins tour.  Several trips to Nevada, including camping with Lystra and his family at Pyramid Lake. Greg was in Vermont for 3 months for work training and the kids and I joined him for a week out here.

It hit me hard , looking through these pictures, when the realization struck that the very last two people I encountered on that trip would come to have meaning in my life all these years later. 

Flash back 1996- 2011

We had been through  a lot leading up to 2011 when life was finally grand and worth all the shit that got us there. 7 years in Phoenix putting Greg through school. living on Ramen and a stone's throw from living in a cardboard box. Prostitutes on the corner, daily highway shootings, junkies knocking on the door looking for a fix. 2 Babies on my hips after Preeclampsia pregnancies and emergency c sections. A Health crash. An Opioid prescription. College Graduation. A Move 400 miles for a job. (The biggest blessing was an Amazing country dr who got me off the Opioids well before it became a problem.  I was one of the first medical Marijuana patients in CA (#23 in my county) and therefore in the US. )Another move 400 miles after job layoffs. This one moved us back home to family and a good job and 2 years of recovery from a long rough patch. 2009 Another round of corporate wide layoffs. Another move 400 miles to follow his career. 

The Years Following 2011

2012 would be the year that my oldest would transfer to the Jr High (for 6th Grade) and points to when things shifted and her health (mental and physical) began to very visibly decline. As a result, Id leave my post with SurfRider Foundation and become a homeschooler and eventually her caretaker. Which has by no means been easy.  It was clear my child’s troubles were significant. Trying to get drs to listen and understand was impossible and her troubles where dismissed. I’m certain that this is at the root of so much of the psychological pain that would later become central to making sure she survived. Greg began travelling coast to coast and was gone 6 months of the year for several years. A room mate situation from hell. and a crazy landlord who had no understanding of boundaries. Being forced into trying to raise geese. And then add the stress of moving to Germany as a high schooler where sport is the only real way of connecting with peers and she can’t even walk... the stress of moving back... Lord. Exhausting. Caretaking will kick your ass.

I’m not saying that I have not had many amazing experiences during this period. The best advice I was ever given was by one of Stars teachers when it was obvious she needed something outside of a classroom experience. The teacher said ""make your world small but fill it with as deeply and as richly as possible."" And we did just that. We got to travel Europe and gain so much knowledge and understanding about the world. I filled it with art and music and acting. I filled it with knowledge and fun.

And returning to the states, I learned to heal myself with food choices. I then went to school and got certified as a Integrative Nutritional Health Coach and launched my own business called ""Here to There Health and Wellness Center"" My house seemed to offer a perfect space for it. But I shattered my wrist. Then before I had recovered. because OMG losing your dominant hand for a year and a half is no small inconvenience... Greg was laid off due to corporate downsizing. We could not move our children again (because while I speak heavily about my eldest and her challenges, my youngest had plenty of his own being on the spectrum and also falling into a caretaker role for his sister as well) and so we built a business with our retirement funds. It was fantastic. Beautiful. We created it from scratch and I can’t be prouder of the vision we brought to life. But alas our region isn’t on that is big in adopting technologies. Heck, I live in the city and can’t get cellular service at my home. And also, our timing coincided with Covid.

So 2011 really was a peak year.

I could use another peak. One to set my flag on and never leave. ",1,1765762747.0,parkithere,0,1.0,False

I miss the kids, I miss you too,

but I hate you for everything you did.



I know you’ll believe it - you never understood,

I hate no one, I just drown in sorrow’s flood.



It aches that you’ll always love me still,

yet you chose a life without me, by your own will.



It pains me that you’re loyal to a world unreal,

while ours with me never dared to bloom and feel.



I endured being crushed, my spirit torn,

trapped in your games, a cold and cruel storm.



Everything ended, all was thrown away,

yet in your mind, I’ll forever pay.



Six years beside you, yet still the foe,

I held your hand in darkness, even when I was low.



Why do I grieve, why do I even care?

I miss the warm embrace, even if it came with despair.



I feel sadness for you - you’re without support today,

sometimes the best help is to simply stay away.



Have fun with anyone you want, and enjoy the mud,

but your true growth waits in complete solitude.



Feed on me one last time - this is my final morsel to you,

my path lies far away, I will stop being the one you blame.



I will live free from your reproach,

this is my freedom, I take back myself.",1,1765762074.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

Freshly built, first pc I ever did. I was playing CP77 and the computer just crashed, randomly. At first I got no screen at all, so eventually I plugged into the Motherboard I/O to finally get a screen. It would sometimes not boot to the desktop, only to the BIOS and half and half the keyboard would work, but once on the desktop everything was fine.

After googling I thought I found the problem. Since I had my BIOS on Expo 1 which as you know sets the DDR5 to its advertised speed I thought that was the problem; playing a CPU/RAM intensive game and it spiked when it was near the limit. My naiveness thought well I paid for the whole ram I'll get the whole ram. So I thought it was that, a ram spike because my GPU was black screened and something on my GPU end messed up.

Once I got it up, I did a windows memory diag to see if there was any issues with the ram - there wasn't

After hours and hours of research I did a full AMD Utility Sweep and DDU in safe mode, then tried to re-install AMD Adrenaline and it kept getting hung up (cant download). So tired of spending hours, I thought Id nuke the whole thing and do a fresh windows install (from USB to eliminate any old files) to hopefully remove all AMD everything to start a new. That decision was backed up by it sometimes not booting to the desktop as well. I did connect to the internet during sign on to go into my MS Office account but the majority install was offline.

Once greeted to the desktop and trying to install AMD Drivers through Adrenaline again, nothing. Cant install. And plugging into my GPU doesn't work whatsoever. The GPU is powered on, fans on etc. The device manager recognizes the GPU and has a yellow triangle on it. Everything online is suggesting what I have already done. DDU, etc. Only thing I can think of is the GPU is bricked. Other than that pc is fine, except Im on my iGPU via the 7800x3d.

I'm about to go off a ledge on this POS. I've tried everything. Only thing I haven't is test the GPU on another pc as I dont have an extra one to test on.

1pmut23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/1pmut23/need_northampton_england_researcher/,Need Northampton England researcher,"Hi!

I am doing research on an ancestor, in an attempt to find his parents, and continue on the search.

Have hit a brick wall. So I am going another route to get a more rounded picture.

I would like to find information on a René LaForce, who supposedly left France and settled in Northampton England. Not sure of the date.

René eventually ended up in Virginia about 1700. We have records aplenty of him in Virginia, down to his will and death date. Other information on him is sketchy and sparse. Other than William Byrd mentioning Laforce in his ""secret diary"" which as since been desiphered and published.  I don't need anything on René in Virginia. His time in England and France we need.

We have a marriage record of René marrying a widow Margaret Friend, 1694. In Northampton England, All Saints. I have a digital image of the marriage record book.

Her husband was a Jeremiah Friend.  I have done a lot of reading and perhaps a Jeremiah Friend was a Sexton, and died when a wall fell on him in 1675. (I think, but not sure. The sexton records I read seemed to mention more than one Jeremiah Friend) Read also that there was a great fire in Northampton at that time. Maybe a fire damaged wall hit him? Kind of curious about that. There was one sexton of the same name who lost his position because of an altercation, and was shuffled out of his job. I cannot determine which Jeremiah was with Margaret. Anyway her husband died and made Margaret a widow and then she was free to marry René, whenever he showed up. Cannot find marriage banns read, so it was a quicky marriage with a special license?

I have found no information on Margaret Friend beyond the handwritten marriage to René church register at All Saints.

It would be nice to find her marriage record to her first husband Jeremiah. And perhaps her birth record.

I want to see Margaret's age when she married René. I have a theory.

Anyway, René ""won the freedom of the town"" of Northampton due to his marriage. His wife was written about in a few publications, stating she was a Tory supporter. Owner of a coffee house and/or inn. I would like to know the name of their properties. 

I would like to see the copies/scans of those common coffee house publications, mentioned as The Rehearsal (not the play, but like a gossip paper), The Observator, and Dyer's. I can not find any of these digitized online in the years that I need. Years would be 1694 and after. Margaret Laforce died 1722 in Northampton,  All Saints. Someone found her death record online from a database, but I have not seen the original record digitized.

I would like to know who to speak to, in order to have some records searched. I don't believe they are digitized yet.

The records would be Quarter Session reports, lists of taxes paid by businesses like inns, ale houses and coffee houses. There are  hearth taxes and window taxes, and records for all that. And who the owners were, and to whom the licenses were issued.

I would greatly appreciate any leads for Northampton England historians and genealogistsl. Who to contact and arrange to search for these records, and how much it would cost. Years, perhaps 1660 to 1722, all in Northampton. To try to incorporate Margaret's birth and first marriage, and what kind of family she came from. And more about her husband's work and family story.

Yes, I know they have a record society there in Northampton with miles and miles of documents stored. But I would like to speak to a person and not have my email get lost in the shuffle on a random inbox.

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read all this!

My aunt lives 8k km away. We're both removed from the family for being gay & we never had a trad aunt-neice relationship cuz we talk about unique religious ab*se, so she's not 'Aunt' Riri. She is studbro.

Studbro & I got coffee where AR showed me she found my gf active on a dating app. I asked ex directly why she was on it cuz we were monogamous. 

Instead of talking w me, ex got mad & said ""well why are you hanging out w studs who aren't me. It's just social media. If you have a problem w me complimenting other femmes on social media that's immaturity I don't have time for."" Along w ""A.R. got issue w it they can bring it up to me directly. What's a stud doing seeing my profile anyway. I dont fuck other studs that shit is gay.""

Mind you ex has a multititude femme friends & I don't balk. Plus we're both females so she is already ""gay.""

It ended w ex saying I'm not allowed stud pals cuz she thinks all studs are just trying to have sex with me, including my aunt, who is married & MY FUCKING AUNT. Ex hung up on me & said we'd talk once she wasn't mad at me.

Over text I apologized & took ownership maybe I addressed it too bluntly. She called it ""Ruining the perfect day.""

Hours of talking w other pal, Andina, [only friend in this state & ex has told me to drop her] Andina said since dating ex i've become increasingly isolated, quiet, apologize for everything, & not myslf. She called us ""onesided.""

I defended ex but eventually accepted we needed to break up.

The text i sent ex:

""I've been tryna support you but you want me to break off all my friends. You keep getting territorial when masc & stud friends want to hang. You keep insisting my Aunt wants to have sex w me. I can't even deal w trying to unpack that. You literally live with your ex half the week to take care of her kids & I don't balk. I know loyalty is important to you but I want to break up cuz the loyalty feels one sided.""

I'm overwhelmed & limited by how stud women are already rare to find single rn & when I do meet mascs&studs, often they are wrapped around a bi ex & her 4 under 4 kids with multiple men.

I'm worried I'll never get a wife cuz in my experience it is always this dynamic, expecting I stop hanging w pals & my aunt cuz they are convinced the presence of studs equals the presence of cheating -yet they're fine w male friends?? & cling to an ex.

I'm so tired of fighting w women who thinj my aunt is trying to have sex w me just cuz she's a stud. It makes me want to become a hermit. She has never done anything weird but I guess her presentation is enough to make girlfriends scream at me. I can't keep being the shield between weird animosity my gifriends have at my aunt/ other stud friends.
When a pal helps me put my hair up or lends me a sweater or hugs me it always turns into ""THEYRE TRYING TO SEX YOU UP. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOYAL TO ME."" My bros are good ppl but studs & mascs I date keep treating them like snakes in the grass which makes me so depressed.
