When we are around he is very well behaved when we eat he lays down on his bed or in his kennel doesn't beg, but the amount of times I've come In from a smoke and he's jumping off the table is immeasurable I've tried pushing in the chairs he learned to push them out bugger is too smart for his own good. He 100% knows he's not supposed to be up there the moment the door opens he jumps off.

We rarely have food on our table because we don't often eat at the table it's used far more for puzzles and laundry.

I don’t really know how to start this. I’ve known my friend for around 3-4 years. We’ve had a pretty typical friendship and are pretty close. Close enough that I could walk in and sleep at her house at anytime. But recently we’ve been getting really close. I think within the last 2 weeks we haven’t been together for 5 days, which typing out makes me think I’m just looking way too into it. We’ve also been getting really close physically. Within the last month I can remember 4 times she’s decided to sit/lay on my lap when there was a completely open space. Recently I stayed at her house and she had to sleep in a different room because of her sister and was vocally upset about it. She’s been sitting close enough for me to notice it’s not normal. Multiple times she’s asked me to join her for simple small trips to the store. So many examples of small things she does or says that throw my mind into a loop of does she or does she not like me too. 

The more I talk about her the more I feel crazy for noticing these small things because I don’t think most of them mean anything. And the problem isn’t that we’re both women, we are both bisexual and have dated girls in the past. The worst part is I know even if she did feel the same we couldn’t. Both of us are part of the same group of friends and have both had problems dating in the group. Neither of us would want to go through that again because we both value our friends very much and wouldn’t want to lose our relationship with them. And she’s trying to move out of state. I’ve tried long distance before and I know I couldn’t do it. My ex was just a few hours away, I couldn’t handle out of state. 

I try to convince myself it’s just me loving my friend, just me caring for her. Every time I think about her for to long I think about how I want her in my life forever. But not in a friend way at all. I think about waking up next to her, making her coffee in the morning. I want to greet her at home after work. I want to cuddle close and watch a movie. I want to fall asleep in her arms. When she sits in my lap I want to grab her waist and just hold her. When she invites me out I make sure I’m more put together. The truth is I’m falling so badly for her but I know deep down it can’t happen. It wouldn’t work. I could list more reasons but it’s late and I have to get up early for work. I just needed to confess ",1,1739427139.0,confessions,0,0.99,False

Regular inspections are key to keeping your plumbing system in top condition. Check for hidden leaks under sinks and around appliances like dishwashers. Don’t forget to inspect your water heater for signs of rust or unusual noises, which could indicate potential failure.

# Proper Use of Plumbing Systems

Plumbing systems are durable but not indestructible. Avoid flushing non-biodegradable items, like wipes or feminine products, down the toilet. Similarly, keep grease, coffee grounds, and food scraps out of your kitchen sink to prevent clogs.

# Seasonal Plumbing Tips

Winter can be tough on your plumbing system, especially in places like Rockville Centre. Insulate exposed pipes to prevent freezing and bursting. During warmer months, ensure your outdoor faucets and sprinklers are in good working order.

# Factors Influencing Costs

* The complexity of the issue.
* The materials required for repairs or replacements.

Lying there in my Bed as the days first light began making its way through my bedroom window looking at me. Laying there looking out of the window to a another day laying there asking myself 

“What has life got to give me today? “

Thinking to myself seeing the sun as its light glimmered through and around the trees branches just outside of my window as the wind blew through its leaves. As if the sun was trying to tell me something as if it was trying to tell me that today was going to be different. 

But just as that thought left me the quietness of the morning was being overridden with the sound of the neighborhood kids.  Walking by my window making their way to a nearby school seeing and hearing that the early morning sounds was not going away anytime soon. Not really wanting to get out of bed to what would be just another day for me.

 But slowly as I made my way up and out of bed making my to bathroom standing there in front of the mirror looking at myself. Looking a not so feeling to young Girl closing in on 30! Standing there running my hand back through my messed up blonde hair. Thinking to myself standing there looking into the mirror thinking to myself 

“What could a blue eyed girl do to get through yet another day.”

 Another day of let’s see if I can get through this day without questioning myself or Life in itself standing there in the bathroom putting my clothes on asking myself 

“ Do I really want to do this?Do I really want this day to even be here” 

Making my way into the kitchen turning on the coffee maker! Not really knowing where to even begin until I have had my mornings coffee. Setting down at the kitchen table to the mornings newspaper along with my coffee. Setting there flipping through the pages of the morning newspaper looking at what else the world may have to look forward to. Throwing the newspaper to the side thinking to myself 

“ is there anything left in this Life, was there any faith left in me at all.”

Knowing that this day was already going to be hard enough as it was Just before grabbing my things before heading out the door. I noticed my coat was still hanging in the closet dropping my purse back onto the kitchen table. Saying to myself 

“My head would still in the bed asleep it if we’re not attached to me” 

Doing a complete 180 making my way back into my room opening up my closet door reaching for it screaming 

“Oh my God! Now where in the hell is it!”

And that was when I noticed a box setting there in the corner out of curiosity I reached for grabbing it out of the closet thinking to myself what was in it. 

Walking back into the kitchen placing it down onto the kitchen table not knowing of what I would find in it. Setting down to open it up to find Memories! Memories that would bring me to rediscovering the past in my life. A past that would bring me to finding something that was missing from my life. 

 I just didn’t realize it at the moment! It was a scrap book along with photos and a letter, with one of the photos being of my mom setting there looking at the photo of my mom not always being very close to her it would still bring a tear.

But It didn’t seem make my day any better at the moment for today marks ten years since she had passed away. And with me going to visit her grave today it did not make it easier seeing this photo here picking up another photo the memories of yesterday hit me hard as I looked into the photo. Looking at a younger me a young Girl of about twelve years of age with my short brown hair standing there next to my mother.

 Who was next to identical to me and setting there beside me was my dog, a dog who I named Buddy. Thinking back I remembered the good times that I had with my dog buddy! But not all of it was good times! But for most teens you just don’t realize how much you would miss your parents till they are gone.

And that was when I found the letter, a letter that I have not seen before today thinking to myself that reading it that it would not make my day any easier. But read it I did, for the letter read as this, 

“. To my lovely Daughter Dakota I am writing this letter to you! For when you get older you will realize the hard times and the good times that we had together.”

“For no matter what you will always be my beautiful little girl my little Dakota! knowing that the last few years that we had together was not the best for either of us. But I always had faith that you would someday see for yourself”

“That no matter what happens in this world that the ones that you love will someday leave you in this Life. 
Leaving you with their memories, so I want you to think back on the time that you ran away from home. Think back on what you found, think back back to what you have seemed to have lost along the way. For as you read this letter that I have written to you I want you to think back on the summer that you found, on what Life brought to you that summer just before your teenage Life was to begin. For then when you find it again you know that as your mother a place I have found a place that i hope you will find too. Knowing that the people you met along the way that summer for in your heart you will know. That there is a place in Heaven for us.”

Reading that sent my mind racing, racing back to that day thinking on everything that the day would bring back to me. But little did I know that the day would bring something! And in a way it that I would have never knew for someone it would bring me to that day.

Remembering back It was early that morning when I got up not wanting to get out bed just as my dog buddy would come running.  Jumping up onto my bed licking my face making himself known in his way telling me in his way. Only the way that my little buddy could do! Letting me know that another day was here another day
to go exploring. to find ourselves wondering out into a world of that only our imagination could.

Giving buddy a hug rubbing his fur as I got out of bed walking into the kitchen as my mom was making breakfast. Setting down at the table as she asked me what I wanted to eat looking at her saying 

“ maybe later I’m not hungry right now” 

for I was still thinking about the argument that we had the night before. But before I could say anything my mom spoke to me saying 

“Honey I know that you are getting older but I am still your mother! You may not want to hear that right now but I just want to be able to talk to you Dakota! and that one day you will appreciate the Life that I am trying to give you!” 

jumping up from my chair looking to my mom as I shouted to her saying 

“ look mom not now I just want to just go! So look I will be back later” 

Making my way out the door as looking back at my mom saying 

“ look I will be back later till then just chilling okay!” 

Walking out the door with buddy following me. Years later I would look back with regret on not giving more respect to my mother then.

 But now a journey awaited me a journey that would in time change my Life forever, forever in a way that I would soon find. Setting there on the back steps with buddy by my side looking out across our farm. I thought to myself

 “what else is out there? What else was there for me in this life.”

 Looking down at buddy saying to him 

“ let’s go find out for ourselves what else is out there for us! For it can not be any worse for us then it is here” 

With that I stood up saying to buddy

 “ let’s go! Let’s see for ourselves what else is out there” 

walking across the field of our farm making our way to the fence line. I thought to myself once I do this there is no turning back! There is only the road ahead of us! Jumping the fence me and buddy made our way to the road with my house now out of sight I knew now. That we was on our way and that we was also on our own! To where I did not know but we would find out when got there! 

As we walked down the dirt road a ways not meeting any cars till we came to the gas station at the end of the road. Seeing a red farm truck parked on the side of the gas station quickly grabbing buddy running up to the truck climbing onto the tailgate. 

 Laying down inside the back of the pickup me and buddy laid there in the back off the pickup truck noticing a blanket in the corner. Quickly grabbing it before anyone would come over covering myself and buddy up laying there it was not long till I heard the owner getting into the truck not noticing us. With him then Pulling out of the gas as I then looked to buddy saying

“Woohoo we are on our way now!”

Feeling as the wind as it hit up against the blanket laying there as we made our way down the road. About fifteen minutes later uncovering ourselves setting up looking out into the empty fields as we  passed by them. Feeling the freedom of the wind making our way down the road. At the same time making sure that the driver didn’t see us.  Looking down at buddy I could see him looking up at me as if he was saying what are you doing. Saying with a smile saying to him 

“ I know what you would say if you could talk but I know what I am doing “ 

looking back out into the opened fields as we continued to drive farther down the road. I thought to myself

“what was I going to do when I got there? Where was I going to go?” 

About thirty more minutes had passed by with the driver still not noticing us pulling into the parking lot of the grocery store. Quickly laying back down covering myself and buddy back up! Laying there waiting hearing the truck door open as a person then got out. Upon hearing the truck door shut waiting a couple of minutes to make sure that everything was clear. Looking all around before uncovering myself and buddy before making our way from the truck not looking back until we were far enough away. 

Looking out across the parking lot I recognized the grocery store that my mom would bring me when we went shopping.

 Walking from the parking lot myself and buddy found ourselves walking down the sidewalk as people would pass us by. Not paying any real attention to them we just kept walking keeping to ourselves until we then came across a gentleman. He was setting there on a bench in front of a the convenient store whittling away. Just as he then Look up at me saying 

“Well hello there! My that is pretty little dog that you have there with you” 

Saying back to him 

“Thank you! His name is buddy! my mom got me from the pound” 

Smiling back to me he then asked me saying 

“So where are you and buddy headed too on this fine day here if I may ask”

Replying back to him I said to him 

“Just seeing what a girl and her dog could find on our way! On our adventure finding out what life has for us”

Looking suspiciously at me and buddy he then said to us 

“ finding yourself on an adventure! Why aren’t you a little young to be out here looking to what Life has to offer you”? 

“Maybe there is someone looking for you, maybe you should reconsider what it is that you are looking for and then when are old enough you then can”

“Then maybe you can see what Life is about, but for now just wait here a moment I will be right back.” 

As he then walked into the convenient store a couple of minutes later coming back out carrying a drink and bag of chips along with a couple of dog treats. As he then handed them to me saying 

“ Look I want you to promise me that you will go home now today! And think about your Life! And sleep on it and when you get up in the morning you just might know that the Life that you have right now. Is the best time, the best memories that you will know! For when you become an adult you may think that Life is grand and that you are on your way! “

“But know this little one the memories that you make as a child are memories that keep you going when Life steps in letting you know that there is someone that still loves you in the memories that you keep.“ 

thanking the kind gentleman as me and buddy then made our way down the street I didn’t know then what he said as I would later in my Life what he meant.

As the evening was about to set in as buddy and myself walked down the road making our way out of town out of sight. We came upon a field making our way across the field as the sun began to set on us we decided to make camp there for the night Just. Having no tent only the stars above us as our cover us as laying there under the stars with buddy curled up next to me. 

Thinking to myself about my mom was she missing me? What was she doing? As I laid there thinking to myself where was I going to go? What was I going to do when I got there? As laid there looking up into a Star lit sky thinking to myself what else was out there? What else did Life have to offer me. 

Soon finding myself falling to sleep asking myself certain things till I would fall to sleep for that night dreaming of myself and buddy being back at the farm. Dreaming of the man that we had met earlier that day as he was telling me in my Dream. 

“ You may not know of your Life right now! But somewhere someone out there has a plan for you in Life”.

 “For everyone that you meet in Life will forever stay with you whether it is in your Dreams or memories. You will know that there is a place for you in this Life” 

As I then Dreamed I then Dreamed of mom. In my dream she was crying, crying for me saying to me 

“ please Dakota come home wherever you are please come back to me” 

Waking up the next morning with a tear in my eye I made a decision, a decision that would lead me to a place, a place that would change my Life forever.

With me and buddy making our way across the field thinking about the journey ahead the journey would take us to where we were going. Only problem was that we had no idea on where that was! We only knew that we were on our way!  Spending most of the day keeping  in the field Till we then came upon a truck parked on the side of the road looking around I could see a individual standing in a field across the road standing in another field. He was just standing there not really knowing on why he was just standing there at the moment.

Thinking to myself we could sneak another ride to somewhere as we did before, quickly running up too the truck climbing over the tailgate and laying down before the individual saw us. It wasn’t maybe about five minutes had passed before hearing the truck door open with someone getting in closing the door. Laying there as the truck started up thinking to myself that whoever it was did not see us as we then pulled onto the road making our way to wherever we was going. Laying there in the bed of the pickup with buddy to my side thinking to myself as laid there watching the clouds in sky pass by as we made our way down the road. 

I thought to myself what was I going to do when I got there? Would I ever see myself going back home again? But whatever would happen I knew that somewhere down the road I would find my place in Life. A place that I knew I belonged there but till then I laid there with buddy by my side looking up at the sky as it passed by I looked to buddy saying 

“We are on our way buddy you and I, for we will find our place in this Life you me and me together we will find our place in this Life.”

As the day went by further down the road finding ourselves laying in the bed of the pickup I could see the nights sky coming into view. Just as we made our way down the highway thirsty and hungry I felt lying there in the bed of pickup. For I did not know when or where we would end up at looking up at the stars as we passed by I found myself falling to sleep in the bed of the pickup as we made our way down the road.

 I found myself Dreaming yet again this time I was standing there looking out of a window looking into out into a world. A world that I was not for sure off a world that seemed distant to me a world that in time I would come to know. As I continued to look out the window I found myself looking at the tree outside of my window the leaves had all but fallen off on to the ground. A cold breeze would make its way through it branches making its way to me as I stood there looking at my mom waving to me from as she stood there looking at me. As she then turned and walked away as I screamed into glass of the window to my mom saying to her.

“Wait mom please come back please where are you going “ 

Turning back to me with a smile looking to me saying 

“ I love you Dakota! I love you wherever your are” 

With that I suddenly thought to myself with tears in my eyes thinking to myself 

“What have I done? What have I done to my mom?”

Just as I then suddenly woke up realizing that I was still in the bed in the back off the pickup feeling the truck pulling in somewhere before coming to a stop. Lying there hearing the truck door open up I laid there with buddy waiting for the right moment before getting up. 

But before I could say anything I suddenly heard a voice, a voice of needless to say a very surprised man saying to me 

“What in Gods name! I can’t even believe to what I am seeing!”

Looking at me with a very stunned with a  surprised look on his face. But before I could even say anything he just looked at me saying

 “You have got a lot of explaining to do but first come with me inside so I can find out where you came from and we can go from there” 

Climbing down from the bed of the pickup me and buddy made our way inside the mans house where he then proceeded to call the local authorities. Knowing that my and buddies journey had came to an end! Just as he ask me if I was hungry if wanted something to eat not turning down a good meal I immediately said to him

“yes very much so”

 After me and buddy ate I then explained to the man my story telling him everything before the local authorities would arrive. But then I heard a voice I heard a voice of what sounded to be a little boy in the next room calling out for his dad. As the man was standing there in his kitchen talking to what seemed to be his wife. Walking over to the room looking in as looked in I saw a boy about the same age as me lying there in bed looking at him  saying 

“Hello“

Looking to me with a surprise the boy then said to me 

“Who are you” 

I replied to him saying 

“ I am Dakota and what is your name” 

As he then spoke bake to me saying 

“My name is Billy” 

Walking closer o him I could see that he was sick he had a tube attached to his arm that was attached to a fluid bag next to him. Standing there next to him asking him if everything was all right he replied to me saying 

“The Doctors told my mom and dad that I had cancer and that it may take awhile for me to get better” 

Just as I was talking to him buddy then came running into the room jumping up onto the bed next to Billy. As I told buddy to get down billy then said with a smile 

“ its okay I like dogs so his name is buddy?” 

Replying to him saying yes that his name was buddy and that we sort of found ourselves on a little journey. Looking at me with a smile as billy then said to me 

“A journey! 

“Man I would love to go on a journey someday a journey to where I could find myself somewhere other then here in this bed” 

Looking to Billy I said to him 

“Maybe one day you will find yourself self on a journey, maybe you me and buddy could go on a journey together”

Smiling to me saying 

“Man that would be great going on a journey”

“I would love nothing but to find myself on an adventure one day!”

With Billy just looking at me as he then looked down at buddy petting him as he smiled. He then looked up to me from his bed saying to me 

“ I want to so bad to find my place in this Life!  I want to just get up from here and go live my Life.”

“But hearing it in my mom and dad’s voice I can hear it that I may not get any better. And all I can do is think to myself maybe if not here in this Life then maybe in another Life I then can find my place in Life”

Just then as his dad would come into his room looking at me saying to me that it was time, time for me to head home. Looking back to Billy before I left saying to him 

“ I hope that one day that you will get better and just maybe one day when you get to feeling better I will come visit you again and we can go on an adventure together” 

As Billy then gave buddy one last hug looking at him smiling petting him one last time before we made my our way to front door. To where the authorities were waiting there to take me and buddy back home.

 As we made our way back home from our little journey pulling into the drive way back at our farm I could see my mom come running out to me as I got out of the car. Grabbing me hugging me crying saying to me 

“Don’t you ever leave me again Dakota! Don’t you ever leave like that again me again” 

hugging my mom saying to her

 “I promise mom I will never leave you again” 

For as the days went on I would set there thinking about billy and Journey that me and buddy went on that day. Thinking to myself settling there on the front porch with buddy setting there beside me. Looking out into the opened field in front of me Just as my mom would come out on the front porch setting down next me. As placed her arms around me with tears in her eyes 

 Telling me that the boy that I had met on my journey Billy! That Billy had passed away this morning! With tears in my eyes setting there leaning up against my mom not knowing of what to think. Saying to my mom

“Why! Billy can’t die! He was going to get better so me him and buddy could go on a journey together”

Just knowing that setting there with my mom giving me a hug saying to me 

“Honey I know that they are things in this Life that are hard to understand. And that as we go through Life we still find ourselves still asking ourselves that from Time to time.” 

For the rest of that evening me and my mom would set there on the front porch talking to one another about what life means for us as we grow up. With that being one of the few times that we did talk with one another, for it was not until I got older that then that I would realize on how much my mom meant to me.

Looking back now thinking to myself setting there in the kitchen holding my mom’s letter that she had written to me knowing now that it would be a letter for me to read later in my life A letter for me to look back upon.

 Thinking of the gentleman that I met on my journey with buddy and that he was right when he told me that the memories that we make during our childhood Sometimes help us get through our Life as adults today. 

And on that day as I stood there at my mom’s grave I thought to myself thinking of my mom! Thinking about Billy so many years ago what he said to me! For there was a place for him in this life and for the little time that he had in Life here, he indeed had a place, a place where he lived in his mom and dads memories and in their hearts. For the little time that I knew him I always thought of him in Life and in memories that he left behind for me. 

For me to grow to appreciate the Life that I had, For there was also another place for him. A place for my mom, a place that someday I would also find myself at. There was a place!

1iocn21,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iocn21/espresso_grinder_4000/,Espresso & Grinder [$4000],"So my Breville barista express finally gave up after over 7 years. Before this we never owned an espresso machine, now we can’t live without one. Considering a Lelit Bianca v3 and a DF64 grinder maybe? I don’t know what to really look for in this price range. It’d be awesome if the espresso machine has a plumb in kit which I believe the Lelit Bianca does. 
High on the list is also something that heats up fast and has dual boilers and doesn’t necessarily need to be kept on all day for when I decide to have another cup.

Any concerns with the Bianca v3 or the DF64 grinder? Should I look elsewhere? This is in the US. No 240 where the machine sits.

Finally any recommendations where to buy from if it is indeed the Lelit? Go direct? Thank you to all you fine coffee lovers.

I’ve totally lost myself and I don’t know how to continue with life.,"Been “dating” this guy since 2020. He’s never actually been my boyfriend but he’s been a constant in my life since then. It’s so much to explain but basically it’s been okay a lot of times and just horrible the next. He hates me so much. I was in relationships before him but I met him after a break up when I was 22 and I’ve been stuck ever since. I’ve never experienced this much turmoil but I feel like if I never talked to him again that I would have nothing left. When we first met we would talk on the phone for 12 hours a day and play video games together, and that hasn’t changed, but in the beginning he was still talking to his ex girlfriend and it made me really confused and upset. We would be constantly talking and then his ex would come into the picture and he’d forget about me for a couple of days and come back. Then, she came to visit him and I promised myself that I’d leave him alone then. But I didn’t. That happened another time and then he even visited her in her state. I should’ve left it alone then. That was all in 2020-2022. Ever since then he has gotten so much angrier. He’s called me every name in the book. retarted, fat, big forehead, dumb, selfish, spoiled. He’s said he hates my cat and thinks he’s ugly. He thinks my job is shitty and he hopes id want to off myself someday when he finally cuts me off. Everything always starts so randomly. Like most recently, it was at his house and because I asked him to make me a separate cup of coffee so we don’t have to share. He puts a lot more creamer than I do and it’s a k-cup machine so I didn’t think this would be a big deal but it was. It started a horrible mess with him saying how much he hates me and how I’m just all of the terrible things. And then tonight, he was talking about a YouTubers breakup and I was saying how we don’t know both sides, which I shouldn’t have because it’s just not good to disagree with him. He got so mad saying that I speak in a snarky tone that is condescending and trying to talk down to him when I absolutely wasn’t. I tried to tell him that it wasn’t like that but he speaks a lot for a long time and if I interrupt him he will get even more mad. He told me tonight that he is disgusted with me and I am still on the phone with him now. I don’t know how to be alone and be okay without him in my life.

So what it will do is, say I put natural language query on the interface of the application. The system will classify if the natural language query is a ""data ingestion query"" or a ""chat query"".

  
If it is a data ingestion query (for ex: I spent $x on y this Friday), it will extract they transactional info from the query and store it on a DB.

  
and if it a chat query (for ex: what was my total expense today), it will simple retrieve the answer using RAG.

1iochv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1iochv7/heres_how_we_managed_to_spend_30_less_in_the_last/,Here's how we managed to spend 30% less in the last 6 months,"My fiancé and I are trying to buy a place of our own. We can't borrow money from banks, since that's impossible unless you have a large and steady salary where we live, and we don't, nor do we know people who we could borrow money from.

Coming up with enough money for an apartment is a herculean task, no matter where you live. So we've decided to focus on that goal, regardless of how much we have to work, or how frugal we have to become.

Here is how we managed to spend **31.2% less** in the last 6 months compared to the previous 6 months.

**1. A monthly spending limit.** If we reach it, we cannot spend a single dime. That's it. Hungry? Figure it out! This has never happened yet. The limit is low, but reasonable, and we can stay below it without having to compromise or lose out on basic needs.

**2. No subscriptions.** Basically everything we've been subscribed to has been cancelled. Everything. We watch free stuff, listen to free music, etc. This has saved over **$100/month**. Everything we had been subscribed to had been a luxury.

**3. No takeaways/ordering in/eating in restaurants.** We don't compromise on food quality. In fact, we eat very healthy food, almost always bought from small local farmers, and we probably spend more on groceries than most people. We cook ourselves. It's cheaper, healthier, and we do more stuff together. It's very pleasurable to choose recipes and figure stuff out together. We used to spend **$320/month** on average on food that wasn't home cooked. We ended up spending $210 less on food each month on average because of this.

**4. Biking/walking instead of driving** anywhere within a reasonable distance. We still drive if we have to, but if we can avoid it, we walk or ride our bikes. This has saved us **$80/month** on average.

**5. No buying clothes/shoes** unless we have no replacement at home. We always do. We had only spent **$72** total on shoes and clothes in the previous 6 months so this isn't a major factor, but it may be for some of you.

**6. Coffee at home only.** We used to spend **$120/month** on average on coffee in bars or buying coffee to go. We have an espresso machine, we bought 4 thermic to go cups, and we can make any type of coffee we want and carry it with us.

**7. Cooking food for our dogs.** We used to buy dog food. Hugh quality too. We would spend $230/month on average on our two dogs, food and treats combined. Now we cook them meals with real meat, sometimes rice, sometimes legumes to go with it. They love it! And we spend **$112/month** less on average!

Being frugal alone will not get us an apartment. We have also started working several jobs in order to speed up the process. In 4 years, if all goes well, we should be able to buy our own place!

He gasped as he watched the other So Kate heel lift up off the ground, the first one being planted firmly on his chest. The red sole flashed in his peripheral vision; black spots flickered in his eyes and he stifled a yelp. Emmy had kicked her other leg up as she leaned over the sink and peered into the vanity, inspecting her Dior rouge lipstick as it set. Satisfied, she stepped down off her stool, who was named Aaron by his parents, but who she had renamed Loser. 

She looked down, noticing her Loser had been squirming almost annoyingly as she had finished her morning makeup routine. She giggled, noticing he was hard. “Loser, if you keep doing that, you’re not going to be allowed this moment of freedom anymore. Do you think you can control yourself tomorrow?” 

“Yes Princess, I will control myself better tomorrow, I am sorry,” Aaron answered softly, meekly. He was truly sorry, but moreso because time out of the chastity cage had become increasingly limited over the last few months. 

Emmy raised her eyebrows skeptically. She left him lying supine on the cold terrazzo bathroom floor. She entered the California walk in closet, and twirled around happily. She took the Louboutins off her pedicured feet, placing them back in the rack. This pair hadn’t been resoled- it was strictly for the bedroom. Of course she had made her Loser buy her a second identical pair for wearing out. She put on a white Calvin lounge bra and panties, and pulled a simple white jersey Prada dress off the hanger and over her slender shoulders. She padded back into the bathroom, to find her little loser still half hard  lying where she had left him. 

She snapped her fingers. “Up.”
Aaron rose. 
She turned her back. “Zip.”
Aaron breathed in the faintly fruity scent of her flowing blonde hair as he zipped her dress. 

“Ice.”
Aaron shivered in anticipation. He retrieved three ice cubes from the wine chiller next to the bed. The uncorked bottle of Dom Perignon from the night before looked more than half full still,  now flat. A twinge of his old self seemed to whisper from a distant corner of his mind, “so wasteful.” But he had been trained to embrace Emmy’s wild excess. Resistance to it was too painful. And besides she deserved it, she was the most beautiful and captivating woman he had ever met. 

Aaron approached her with the ice cubes melting in his palm. 
“Well, you know what to do. Times up, you don’t want to be late, back in your cage.”
Aaron rubbed the ice cubes up and down his still  semi-erect dick, feeling it shrink rapidly. He put the black Cobra cage back on, and Emmy turned the key in the lock before returning it to its usual home, dangling from her sterling anklet. 

“Meet me for lunch today, Loser. At The Grill. Noon?” 

Aaron tried to summon a mental image of his agenda for the day. “12:30?”

“That works.” She smiled and smacked his bare ass playfully. 

Aaron dressed hurriedly.  He finished tying his tie on the ride down the elevator from the 23rd floor of his 85th street apartment. Well, Emmy’s apartment really now. She had him sign it over to her almost a year ago when she had decided she’d like to move in. He was greatful she allowed him to stay there. Though a part of him missed sleeping in the bed, he had grown accustomed to the oversized dog bed he now occupied at the foot of the California king where Emmy slept. 

He was jarred from his reverie as he walked through the doors of the firm. His assistant took his coat and handed him coffee, unleashing a barrage of appointment reminders for the day. His phone vibrated with a purchase notification on his credit card. He glanced at it as he pretended to listen to his assistant, wondering how anyone could spend $500 before noon without leaving the house. 

After his assistant finished her onslaught and left him, he opened his checking account app. $448.49 would cover lunch, but it wouldn’t leave much for the rest of the week. Fortunately it was Tuesday already. The irony of being an investment banker living paycheck to paycheck wasn’t lost on Aaron. But it was worth it to him if he could keep Emmy happy. 

He buried his nose in spreadsheets and tried not to think about their lunch date.

I’ve been having issues with GI and hives/itchy mouth from certain foods. I couldn’t figure it out, I had suspected that I was lactose intolerant and may have issues with wheat. I decided to get a skin prick test done to see what I reacted too most. The results were… wild (to me at least).

Anyways. Linked to this post is a photo of my results. The lower the number the less inflammatory the food is. From my understanding “0” is generally very accurate, where as all of the other reactions could have up to a 60% false positive for fruits and veggies. 

My doctor said the test was “out of 13” I believe? So some of the “5” scores a little lower. I eat at least 4-5 of these items daily and if I avoid all of them it will cause mayhem to my diet. 

What should my next steps be? Blood test? Elimination diet/trial and error?

Is it possible some of these are false positives (garlic, black pepper and blueberry)?

1ioc7xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/agency/comments/1ioc7xc/5_common_mistakes_i_have_seen_agency_owners_make/,5 common mistakes I have seen agency owners make at the start and done it myself,"I made pretty much every mistake in the book, running my agency so far. I figured I'd share some hard-learned lessons. These screw-ups cost me sleep, money, and probably a few gray hairs.

**1.  Not doing any outreach/lead gen when I already have project**

You know that feeling when you're neck-deep in client work, and lead generation feels like yesterday's problem? Been there. I used to get so caught up in active projects that I'd completely abandon outreach. Then like clockwork, all projects would wrap up around the same time, leaving me in an empty pipeline. Cue the panic outreach, desperate LinkedIn messages, and that sinking feeling in your stomach.

There was a time we spent the next six weeks after a very successful project, doing the agency equivalent of cold calling, taking on projects we wouldn't normally touch, and basically starting from scratch.

**The Simple Fix:** Block out sacred time for some outreaching, even (especially!) when you're swamped. Best time to line up leads is when you are not desperate. The feast-or-famine cycle isn't a law of nature - it's a result of inconsistent lead generation. Break the cycle.

**2. Trusting too much in my “closing abilities“ and coming in unprepared for the calls**

Picture this: You hop on a call, coffee in hand, thinking you'll charm your way through it. Then the client starts talking about their industry-specific needs, and you're sitting there nodding like those dashboard dogs. Been there, done that, got the awkward silence t-shirt. People are smart, they can sense when you are full of crap and you have no idea what they are saying to you.

**Just take the 30mins before each call to do your homework**. Do the basics at least. What they do, how they make money, terms they use and some rough idea of a solution you can offer to them - you can fine tune the details later in when you sending in your proposal.  
Just search on google “ai meeting cheatsheet“ or “ai sales copilot for agencies“, there are plenty of gpt wrappers that do all of that for you.

**3. Not thinking about retainers**

Not all projects can be on a retainer but if you only see milestone based income from a project, that’s a problem. It’s easier to get more money from an existing client than getting a new client. Without retainers, I was living that feast-or-famine life harder than a freelance designer during the holidays. December we were eating good and January was ramen and tap water.

**Stop treating retainers like they're optional**. They're not. Make them your standard operating procedure. Try to find ways to offer a service on an ongoing basis on top of your main work, even if it is small fee for maintenance, content updates, weekly reports, etc. They add up. Bonus tip: Offer a small discount for annual prepay - you'd be surprised how many clients go for it.

**4. Not paying myself livable wage**

This one's embarrassing. I was out here running an agency, looking successful on LinkedIn, but eating dollar store ramen to make payroll. The irony of wearing a nice suit to client meetings but checking my account balance before buying coffee wasn't lost on me. Once had to decline a dinner because I literally couldn't afford my share of the bill. Not my proudest moment.

**Pay yourself first, period.** Set up automatic transfers on retainer payment days. Your business isn't sustainable if it can't pay its most important employee (you).

**5. Not managing or centralizing client communications**

Client messages spread across email, WhatsApp, Slack, carrier pigeon... it was a mess. Had a client once message me on LinkedIn, email, AND text within 5 minutes. I nearly threw my phone out the window. Best part?Small but important feedback got buried in a WhatsApp chat, and we missed to include it in the deliverable. Fun times.

**Onboard your clients and teach them how to communicate your way.** Have a defined way of sharing updates and stick to it. Be it client portal, email or slack, pick one and stick to it.

1ioc6k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1ioc6k6/lost/,Lost.,"In December of 2020 I got into a relationship with a female (17), and me (18). She had aspirations to join the military and plans with her life that she talked about frequently with such enthusiasm. This being the first relationship i was seriously involved in, I had purposefully impregnated her. Mind you this was within months of meeting each other. With that being said we had gotten more and more intimately involved with each other (she had lived with me at my parents house for a few weeks) until she had a miscarriage. A rather difficult one at that for being so early in the pregnancy. I believe she was 8 weeks or almost. 2 visits to the ER and Surgery Tower for D&C i was moving in with her grandparents and  parents (we bounced from her parents out of town and gp on the outskirts of town) She had bounced jobs fairly frequently trying to find her trade. 

Well around halloween of 2021 she had a job at this home decor store on the busier side of town and would have me come to work with her and sit in the car while she worked every so often, and her sister had been in town. She had came with us to stay and chill with me. Me and her sister had been on the 4th hour of listening and singing to oldies when i had hopped in the backseat to watch a movie with her on my phone. 

Eventually the conversation had gotten a little heated and i had asked her to kiss me but was refused. I left it at that but that night when we had gotten home I was making a fake email and a fake snap to talk to her sister. Which I did. We sexted and talked about nasty things we’d like to do to each other, and i talked about running away with her frequently. Eventually that had led to us planning how I would cheat on my gf with her. We had planned for a few weekends away. 

Flash forward to the day of and when my gf was asleep while we were watching Cruella I took her to the bathroom and had sex with her on the linoleum floor. More than once. Flash forwards a few weeks and its really starting to eat me up and I feel horribly guilty knowing i have to sleep next to the person i was considering marrying without telling her about this. Her sister still sexted me and sent me nudes talking about how she wished we were together. I ended up panicking and cutting things off with her sister telling her how im still in love with my gf and whatnot this was a mistake yadda yadda yadda. Things ended there but not really. 

The relationship with my gf continued until january of 2023 where i had worked with her dad for most of that time. For the last 6 months things had gotten really bad between us. Me feeling the guilt heavily i gave up on communication. I was looking for any easy out she would have given me to leave but she didnt give me one. Now that I write this and look back on things I genuinely believe she was my soulmate and i messed things up beyond recognition. 

When we broke up we had gotten into an argument over doing laundry at her grandmas and I didnt want to go associate with her people so i blew up a bit. Stating i wasnt going anywhere and that there was nothing she could say that could change my mind and locked myself in the bathroom. When she had unlocked the door to investigate why i was acting the way i was because of how out of pocket and random it was i stormed to the couch and hid under a blanket. When she moved to the couch to uncover me it was a bit of a tussle for her to get grip on the blanket when i planted my foot on her and pushed her off. She had fallen backwards and fell over the coffee table we had. I then stood up grabbed my cigarettes and said i was going for a walk while she sit there crying. Im walking for a few blocks thinking about moving home and what im going to do when her dad pulls up on me in his car, proceeds to get out and punch me three times in the nose. Splitting it wide open but not breaking it. Karma i know… 

I then had moved back home and she had tried for a few months to get back together with me before finally cutting ties to me and blocking me. I regret my decisions to cheat on her with every fiber of my being and if i could go back and change things id’ve made it so i had never asked her for a ride home that thursday night. 

Shes happy now with her new boyfriend that shes been with since march of 2023 and her sister has a bf and a kid now as well. Im sorry for everything i had put her and her family through and the only promise i am 5000% positive i wont break anymore is that im trying to be better. 

Ive been with a few different women since them, been cheated on myself and truly believe that if i hadnt made the decisions i made I would be laying next to her still and not making a reddit post struggling to cope after years. 

The few times i have contacted her, mind you not to rekindle things but to finally communicate after the shell i put myself in broke, and she immediately cut ties. Left me with, “Have a nice life.” It will never be. Not without her and the family we had just begun to build.",1,1739425030.0,venting,1,1.0,False

First, break out of the pseudo-Traditionalism that has been fostered at your respective, State's high commands. 

Secondly, stop promoting people who cant translate their ""political prowess"" outside of Social media, ie. Swatarup in Bengal. 

Thirdly, update yourselves. Get in tune with what is happening. In the current world, even hinting at prospects like, ""[complete elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cpi-m-manifesto-promises-to-dismantle-indias-nukes-rajnath-singh-reacts-5461865)"" will lose you vote. Don't try to change the rhetoric that's running wild, instead, use aspects of it to make a statement. 

Fourth, start coming out of your shells. The cultural identity of Marxists and Left Wing people in general have been stereotyped, caricatured to oblivion. Use the resources your party has to try and mend that to whatever extent you can. 

Fifth, Fighting casteism, social evils, traditionalist orthodoxy isn't the same as fighting religion. Organized religion will outlast every political force, and there is nothing you can do about that. Attacking someone's faith doesn't bode well for you.

Sixth, your ideology is still stuck in the 20th Century. It is European in its origin and philosophy. Understand that before trying to change the fabric of Indian beliefs. The way a certain group of [pseudo-Liberal Left wingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYfBT6GVBJs) behave has harmed your image. And you know what is the worst part, none of your party members have condoned that behavior because you fear that you will isolate the base who actually votes you.

Seventh, Start cleaning up your acts. The old guard can only give you advice, usher in a new generation of people who actually behave like left wingers. Not pseudo-liberal borda bordis.

As someone who struggles with gloomy winters and occasional seasonal affective disorder (SAD), I’ve tested quite a few light therapy lamps over the years. This one caught my eye because of its compact design, adjustable features, and affordability. While it’s not perfect, it certainly delivers in key areas.

The design of this therapy lamp is sleek and minimalist, which fits seamlessly into my home office setup. It’s lightweight—just 0.46 kilograms—and easily portable, making it convenient to move between rooms or even pack for travel. The compact size doesn’t compromise its performance, though, as the lamp produces an impressive 10,000 lux of brightness. I was initially skeptical about its durability due to its lightweight build, but it has held up well despite my frequent repositioning. However, its light weight does make it prone to tipping over if not placed securely.

[Ready to buy Magicteam 1140-413-11? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://agegene.com/product/magicteam-1140-413-11-review-with-b08bc7zhhb/)

One of my favorite features is the range of adjustable brightness levels. Whether I need a gentle glow or the full 10,000 lux for a mid-morning energy boost, this lamp has me covered with 10 brightness settings. The addition of a one-touch button for maximum brightness is incredibly convenient, especially on those drowsy mornings when fumbling with controls feels like a chore. I also appreciated the customizable timers ranging from 10 to 60 minutes. It’s perfect for setting and forgetting while I sip my coffee or dive into work. The memory function is a thoughtful touch—it remembers my last brightness and timer settings, saving me from readjusting every time.

The color temperature offers a warm white light that mimics natural sunlight without being too harsh on the eyes. I didn’t experience any flickering, and the lamp includes UV protection, which is reassuring for long-term use. My partner, who is sensitive to artificial light, found it comfortable to use as well. I’ve even caught my kids sneaking it into the living room during their homework sessions because they enjoy the bright, cheerful ambiance it creates.

As for placement, the lamp comes with a stand that can double as a wall mount, making it versatile for different spaces. I’ve kept it on my desk for the most part, but I did try mounting it on the wall above my reading nook. It worked beautifully there, casting a soft yet energizing light that made my evenings feel cozier.

**Pros**

* Compact and lightweight, ideal for small spaces or travel.
* Offers 10 adjustable brightness levels and a one-touch 10,000 lux setting.
* Memory function retains your preferred settings.
* Includes UV protection and flicker-free lighting for eye comfort.
* Affordable compared to other therapy lamps with similar features.

**Cons**

* Lightweight design can feel somewhat flimsy and prone to tipping.
* Lack of a 5-minute timer option for quick sessions.
* Brightness might still be too intense for extremely light-sensitive users, even at lower settings.

**Comparison to Competitors** When compared to popular competitors like the Verilux HappyLight and Circadian Optics lamps, the Magicteam 1140-413-11 holds its ground remarkably well. While the Verilux offers a sturdier build and more premium materials, it comes at a significantly higher price point. Circadian Optics lamps are known for their stylish designs, but they often lack the same level of adjustability in brightness and timer options. The Magicteam lamp may not win any awards for aesthetics or premium feel, but it excels in functionality and value for money. Its compact size and portability also give it an edge over bulkier models.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** Given its feature set and performance, this therapy lamp offers excellent value for money. It’s not the cheapest on the market, but its 10,000 lux output, adjustable settings, and memory function make it a worthwhile investment. You could spend more on a fancier design, but for practical purposes, this lamp checks all the essential boxes without breaking the bank. If you’re on a budget or new to light therapy, this is a great starting point.

I tested all the features extensively, from the adjustable brightness to the timers and even the wall mounting setup. The lamp lived up to its claims, proving to be a reliable companion during dreary, sunless days. My mornings feel noticeably brighter—not just because of the light but because of the mood-lifting effect it has on me. My grandma even commented on how cheerful my office looks now, and she’s not one to hand out compliments easily!

1iobvha,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1iobvha/lack_of_chemistry_or_bold_lie/,Lack of chemistry? Or bold lie?,"Hi all. I’m a 35F who recently moved to the city. I connected with a 38M on a dating app a few weeks before I made the move. We chatted for a week at which point he proposed we should meet up once I made the move. I reached out to him per our agreement and we actually met up 2 days after my arrival. He kindly offered to meet me on my side of town at an upscale bar that he selected. We ended up chatting for 3 hours. In my opinion, we had good chemistry and were able to establish a healthy flirtatious banter. We even talked about our shared desire for children when he brought up the topic of his nieces. Since we were seated at the bar, I could feel his knees grazing mine throughout the night and I made sure to casually touch his arm, back, and bicep when appropriate to signal that I was physically interested in him. He offered to drive me home and we ended the night with a nice hug in his car. I could tell he was probably too shy to go for a kiss and it’s not my style to kiss on a first date either. Immediately after getting home I texted him saying I had a great time and he said the same. He texted the next day to ask how my day was and disclosed that he went to church and spent time with his dog. We share the same religious background so I thought he would be a decent upstanding guy even if we didn’t work out. The next day he asked if I would be interested in having dinner on his side of town later that week. Against my better judgment, I ultimately agreed because he would have been working that day and I wouldn’t be so I didn’t want to unnecessarily burden him. When I arrived outside the restaurant, he immediately complimented me, which felt great given the effort I put into my appearance for the date. Dinner conversation was free flowing and easy with no awkward pauses but I noticed he didn’t ask me deep questions about myself (for example, what I was looking for, previous relationship history, etc.). I also didn’t because I was trying a new approach to dating where I try to be more relaxed than I usually am. We ended up going to a bar afterward because we were the last ones at the restaurant before they closed for the night. While I appreciated that he made the reservation in advance I would have liked for him to arrange for my travel/Uber as well since he knew it was an expensive journey and I didn’t yet have a car, while he did. Furthermore, and more importantly, I knew he had the means to because he is extremely well compensated by his job. Bear in mind I had just moved and with that comes lots of expenses. This second date was 4 hours in total. Before we left the bar, he got up and suggested I get my uber while he made his way to the bathroom (to freshen up I gather). He ended up kissing me just before I got in the Uber I got for myself. I was so distracted by his lack of chivalry in that regard that I wasn’t feeling the kiss - at all.

We continued to text while he was out of state visiting his family for the holidays. He ended up coming back to town earlier than expected and called me on New Years Eve to see if I wanted to spend it with him. When I asked what he had in mind, he said he would be down to cook if I wanted to come over. He even asked if I had any allergies and what I’d like to drink since he knew I wasn’t drinking alcohol due to medical reasons. Naively, I thought it would be a chill night with some intimacy but nothing crazy considering we had never talked about physical intimacy/sexuality or anything of the sort. The first half of the evening was tame while we caught up on our holidays and ate the food he prepared. Almost immediately after getting settled on the couch, he made a move and things progressed from there. I eventually stopped things and he still asked me to stay over for the night (after saying he felt tired at 10 pm). We got comfy in bed and cuddled while we watched an episode of his favourite show. He again tried to advance things physically in the bedroom but I didn’t feel comfortable reciprocating just yet. For context, I am a virgin (which he knew nothing about as he didn’t bother to inquire) and I wasn’t comfortable doing stuff to or with him (in terms of penetration) without first having a conversation about STI screening. By no means am I waiting until marriage.

I felt his energy immediately shift after I stopped him from advancing further the second time we had engaged with one another. We ended up going to bed before midnight and he didn’t attempt to kiss me when I said happy new year to him and he said the same back to me. He also didn’t engage in any pillow talk. Notably, the following morning, he didn’t make any further moves or perform any aftercare whatsoever, which was extremely disturbing and hurtful given this had been my first time being intimate with someone in any significant capacity. Truthfully, it felt as though he couldn’t be bothered to engage with me at all and wanted me out of his space. He didn’t even offer me a glass of water let alone coffee or food. I remained in bed thinking we’d finally be able to chat about our physical intimacy and boundaries after he returned from walking his dog but I was sorely mistaken. He only returned to the bedroom to play with his dog who had made its way back and eventually made his way to his living where he put football on and did some cleaning in his kitchen. I felt so uncomfortable and unwanted that I promptly changed my clothes and played with his dog a bit while I waited for the Uber I ordered myself. When I hugged him goodbye I felt in my heart that was the last time I would see him again. When I got home around 9 am, I called him and asked if he felt the vibe was weird to which he said no. I also disclosed I was a virgin to which he said “I didn’t know” before quickly changing the subject. He genuinely sounded surprised because of how engaged I was and authentically performative I appeared to be. The reason for my disclosure had to do with the fact that I wanted him to know that I was interested in him (against my better judgment) and my lack of reciprocity in the bedroom did not have to do with a lack of my desire for him. Not once did he think to inquire about how I was feeling. Given his age and proclaimed religiosity, I expected more empathy and compassion.

I didn’t hear from him until very late Sunday night (4 long days later) by text, in which he said he had time to reflect and that he felt I was really awesome and he enjoyed our time together but he wasn’t sure if the chemistry was there. He claimed that he wanted to remain friends. I was devastated. I texted him the following night stating it was fine but that I was confused as to why he would initiate physical intimacy if he had concerns about our chemistry that he never even informed me of. Spoiler alert, he never dignified my message with a response as I had his. Even though I wanted to go off on him, I thought asking a simply worded question would entice/encourage him to respond. I was wrong.

I willed myself to move on by going out on a date with another guy 2 weeks later but that experience showed me what a true lack of chemistry feels like (despite that guy being wonderful in many other ways).

This has left me feeling like the previous guy made a premature and hasty decision that was truly wrong and unfounded. Objectively, I’m a catch: beautiful, intelligent, kind, ambitious, successful, charismatic, poised, and engaging. I don’t know why this guy didn’t even care to bring up his supposed concern in a conversation. I don’t believe a man would be so proactive in courting me and initiating physical intimacy solely focused on my pleasure if he truly felt no chemistry at all. My gut tells me he came up with that reason because he knew it would be difficult and close to impossible to refute. For reference, he is White and I am Black. We have vastly different interests but I took great effort to learn about his past times and he never did the same for me. It’s been a month since things ended abruptly and he hasn’t unmatched me on Hinge; however, our conversation is now hidden because of the elapsed amount of time.

I guess my question is, what do you think truly changed for him in such a short amount of time (ie. 2 hours)? Do you think he’ll ever reach back out to me again?

I’m hurt. I felt like we had a palpable physical chemistry and the potential for emotional intimacy as time went on. His eyes would sparkle when he looked at me. I have enough experience to know that is rare to come by in this dating labyrinth. Ultimately, I am left wishing that he will reach out and apologize for his mistakes and ask for another chance while also feeling incredibly embarrassed and rejected. Lastly, would I look delusional or obsessed if I were to send him a follow request on Instagram?

TLDR: I (35F) just moved to a new city. Connected with a guy (38M) on Hinge before I made the move. Met up with him for 3 dates in total. First date at a bar. Second date at a restaurant then bar. Third date on NYE at his house where he offered to cook for me. Never had any conversations about physical intimacy. He quickly escalated things on our third date and I (kindly) stopped him at a certain point. His entire demeanor immediately changed. Appeared to give no fucks about me. Pretty much ignored me the following morning. I called him once I got home and asked if he felt the vibe was weird but he denied that. I went on to explain that I was a virgin but very much interested in him. He said he didn’t know then quickly changed the subject. He ghosted for 4 days after which he reached out, said I was really cool and he had a fun time with me but wasn’t sure the chemistry was there. Said he hoped we could still be friends. I sent him a text back saying that was fine but I was confused why he initiated physical intimacy if he was unsure about our chemistry and never let me know that. Was he just looking for something casual all along? Any chance he’ll change his mind and reach back out. Will I look crazy or obsessed if I send him a follow request on Instagram? I just miss him.

I asked her to study with me one time putting myself out there because I thought maybe it was a way to connect with her and shoot my shot. She just ghosted and rejected me. She later admitted that she was wrong and I just didn't have the same trust for her anymore. 

FAST FORWARD to this year we are on the same bowling team. I need a ride to the event. At this point we have built greater report but I still in truster by the side to text her up. This time she immediately said yes and she even brought me a drink.  Once in the car he literally were awkward around each other and it was kind of my fault. She tried to bomb with me with my favorite music ask me how my day was going and it just turned to awkward car ride with your friends like mother. 

It's kind of funny to think about but I really hate it because we really should have been close friends given how many times we spend time with each other. But my social skills are just that bad and there's other guys in classroom that talk to her even though she has a boyfriend. I'm just that guy who just couldn't break past the surface
  
Now I feel like I ran it but that pretty much explains why I just feel like I can't connect with women. Its like that with all girls.  It is so weird because girls tell me that I'm a nice sweet man and I'm not braining at least I should be their gay male friend right?  So IDK but that my rants over",0,1739423719.0,GuyCry,7,0.2,False

1iobt8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1iobt8y/18f_hello_im_looking_for_a_boyfriend_just_kidding/,[18F] Hello! Im looking for a boyfriend (just kidding but someone committed who texts a lot✨),"I just got out of a 6 year relationship so definitely not a boyfriend.  
One thing preknown but solidified after the breakup was my lack of friends outside of them. That being said, honorable mention to my seester, roommate in college, energy matcher, coffee date, ya love her. She keeps me from being too lonely. Second mention to my discord friend(s). We only talk a handful of times every couple months for reasons that will go unmentioned. They’re a blast, great company, usually funny, love them too.   
By a boyfriend but NOT a boyfriend I mean a new socializing individual who is most likely a guy just cuz I tend to get along and relate to dudes more. Someone who is committed, and has decent response time. Dead inside but funny. Sarcastic and sweet. Someone who can have fun and be weird or dark but also knows when to be mature and adult a bit. Maybe only some of this I don’t know I’m not tryna build someone just be yourself. I text a lot and I spam if I’m bored.   
Few problems though. 
1. I energy match so you gotta bring the energy or ima be awkward as fuck. I don’t mind leading the conversation but you gotta put yourself out there a bit too or this is going no where.
2. I get bored easily so if nothings happening in like a week I don’t want to waste my time (refer to problem 1)
3. I have a tendency to not click with people, find them annoying idk I do better with people who do things that catch me off guard, like calling me out, saying the unexpected etc. I apologize in advance but it’s true. I like real things, deep talks, late night calls (one I know you)
4. I’m very sarcastic. I like dark humor. I cope with humor. I shit talk a lot. Had one person where all we did was insult each other, I learned nothing about them ever but it was fun. That’s not everyone’s thing and that’s ok! Just means I might upset you by accident if we talk long enough for me to get past my introvert stage.  
I’m gonna end it there cuz I have said a lot and I want people to message because they vibed with something I said not because I said I like ATLA or baking cookies. 17-19yo please, older than that is pushing it.  
REMEMBER: P L A T O N I C and if you’ve read this far thank you! Might as well message cuz something probably intrigued you. If we don’t click so sorry but thanks for stopping by! If you don’t message that’s ok, have a good day! :)

1iobsus,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1iobsus/tifu_by_having_a_deep_conversation_with_a_squirrel/,TIFU by having a deep conversation with a squirrel,"So today I was enjoying my morning coffee on my apartment balcony when I noticed a squirrel eyeing me from the nearby fence. At first, I assumed it was just on the hunt for crumbs—but then it started tilting its head in a very deliberate way. Before I knew it, I found myself blurting out, ""Hey buddy, what's the meaning of life?"" I know, it sounds absurd.

But here’s the kicker: instead of scampering off immediately, the little creature paused and lightly tapped the railing with its tiny paw—as if it was trying to tell me something profound. For about ten minutes, I sat there, half laughing and half genuinely curious, as the squirrel’s silent “responses” felt oddly philosophical. Eventually, it darted away with a shiny acorn, leaving me both baffled and strangely inspired.

Now I’m left wondering if I just experienced a bizarre moment of clarity or if my caffeine-fueled imagination is playing tricks on me. Has anyone else ever had a surreal encounter with nature that left them questioning reality? Or am I just overthinking a squirrel’s quirky behavior?

TL;DR: I ended up having an unexpectedly deep, albeit weird, chat with a squirrel while on my balcony.

The summer before last summer (summer 2023), I’d crushed on (ashamedly towards the end of a previous relationship, but not obviously not pursued). After that relationship ended early on in the summer, I hit her up on dms, and we chatted (possibly slightly flirty at some points, but unclearly so) for two months or so. Towards the end of the summer, she ghosts me, and I accept that and did not text her at all after she chose not to respond to my previous text. 

Then a little over a year ago (December ‘23), I approached her in the dining hall, greeted her, made small talk for 30 seconds or so, told her I thought she was really pretty and asked her if she wanted to grab coffee sometime. She said something (I imagine an excuse to be polite) about having too much work or something. I accepted that in a short, but gracious and friendly way, and then went my separate way. 

The thing is, I’ve still sort of really crushed on her from afar all this time, and although I’ve had some situationships since my first long time girlfriend years ago, I’ve really only felt impassioned infatuation/attraction for this girl solely. I’ve dated several girls and been with others casually, so I am experienced/self aware enough to know that it would be very likely pointless, but I’d like to send her flowers via 1800 Flowers for Valentine’s Day. I would do it non anonymously, as that seems less creepy. I want to clarify that I am aware that this is 95% likely to be ineffective, I sort of more like the idea of doing it.

**Echoes of Mercy**

By: Midnight Warlock

My name is Michael Warren, and I’ve always been a skeptic. At least, that’s how I’d describe myself—the kind of guy who doesn’t believe in ghosts, dismisses urban legends, and laughs off stories about haunted houses. I work a nine-to-five desk job, crunching numbers for a mid-sized accounting firm, and my life is as ordinary as they come. Or at least, it was.

Growing up, I was a quiet kid. I kept to myself, preferring books and video games over social outings. My parents were loving but practical people who taught me to focus on the tangible, the explainable. Maybe that’s why I’ve always been so good at compartmentalizing—shoving uncomfortable thoughts into the darkest corners of my mind and pretending they don’t exist. But lately, those dark corners have been pushing back with a vengeance.

I’ve been having dreams. Not just ordinary dreams, but vivid, unsettling nightmares that leave me gasping for air and drenched in sweat. They’ve become a nightly occurrence, and I can’t shake the feeling that they’re more than just dreams. They feel like… memories. Memories of a place I haven’t seen in decades but can’t seem to forget. A place that has taken root within me, growing like a malignant tumor in the dark recess of my mind. And now, I’m beginning to wonder if my skepticism was misplaced all along, a shield I desperately constructed against something far more real and terrifying than I ever imagined.

The nightmares started subtly, a faint unease clinging to the edges of my sleep. At first, I dismissed them as stress, the byproduct of long hours at work and an unhealthy diet of caffeine and convenience store dinners. But they intensified, growing more visceral, more insistent with each passing night.

Every night, I find myself wandering the sterile, flickering halls of an old hospital. Mercy Hill. The name echoes in the silent chambers of my mind like a distant, mournful bell. The faint hum of fluorescent lights, struggling against the encroaching darkness, and the echo of distant voices surround me, their words unintelligible but pleading, begging. I strain to understand, to decipher the garbled cries, but they remain just beyond the grasp of comprehension, like a language I once knew but have long forgotten.

The air in these dreams carries a damp, metallic smell, like blood and disinfectant, that clings to me even after I wake. It’s a sickeningly familiar aroma, laced with the faintest hint of decay. It invades my senses, coating my tongue with a bitter taste that lingers long after I’ve dragged myself out of bed.

The architecture of Mercy Hill is etched into my mind. The cold, gray linoleum tiles beneath my bare feet, the peeling paint on the walls, the relentless, repetitive pattern of the faded wallpaper. The smell, the colors, the textures; all combining to create a symphony of decay and despair. The dreams always end the same way: I’m standing before Room 319, its door slightly ajar, a sliver of blackness beckoning me in. And I feel a cold hand press against my back, urging me inside. It's not a forceful shove, but a subtle yet insistent nudge. A skeletal finger tracing the contours of my spine, sending shivers down my back. I always wake up before crossing the threshold, drenched in sweat and with my heart pounding a frantic rhythm against my ribs, as if trying to escape the confines of my chest.

As a child, I spent a few nights in Mercy Hill Hospital after a severe case of pneumonia. I was barely six years old, and my memories of the place are hazy, fragmented snapshots of dimly lit hallways and shadowy figures lurking just beyond the periphery. I remember the incessant beeping of machines, the hushed whispers of nurses, and the cold, clinical scent that permeated every corner of the building.

But one memory stands out clearly, as sharp and vivid as if it happened yesterday: a night when I woke to see a pale figure standing at the foot of my bed. Not a doctor, not a nurse, but something… else. It was shrouded in shadow, its features obscured by the dim light, but I could sense its malevolent gaze fixed upon me. Its eyes were black voids that seemed to pull the light from the room, swallowing everything in their path. I screamed until a nurse rushed in, her face creased with concern. She flicked on the harsh overhead lights, flooding the room with sterile illumination, and dismissed my fear as a nightmare. Even then, I could feel an unseen presence lingering just beyond the edge of the light, a cold, watchful entity that had no place in the world of the living. That presence, that lingering dread, has haunted me ever since.

The hospital has been closed for years, its history marred by rumors of malpractice and unexplained deaths. The place reeked of something rotten, something beyond the standard musty smell of an abandoned building. People whisper about patients who went in for routine procedures and never came out, about staff who vanished without a trace, their names erased from the records as if they never existed. Mercy Hill is a cautionary tale, a place parents warn their children to avoid after dark. A monument to secrets, and a grave marker for untold sins. But for me, it’s more than just a story—it’s a recurring nightmare I can’t escape, a suffocating shroud that threatens to consume me whole.

The dreams have begun to bleed into my waking life, poisoning my thoughts and clouding my judgment. I can’t focus at work anymore; tasks that once came easily now seem impossible, the numbers swirling on the screen like malevolent spirits mocking my efforts. My efficiency has dropped, and my attention wanders, drawn back to the sterile halls of Mercy Hill.

My boss, a no-nonsense man named Mr. Henderson with a perpetual frown and a thinning comb-over, has started to notice my decline. His eyes, usually devoid of any emotion, now glint with a barely concealed annoyance. “You’re slipping, Warren,” he said during a tense meeting last week, his voice as sharp and cold as a scalpel. ""Your performance is unacceptable. If things don't improve, we may have to...re-evaluate your position here."" I nodded, muttering an apology, avoiding his gaze. But I couldn’t explain the truth: my mind is consumed by the echoes of a place I haven’t seen in decades, a place that has somehow burrowed its way into my subconscious and refuses to let go.

I confided in my best friend, Sarah, over coffee at our favorite shop, ""The Daily Grind."" Sarah’s a practical woman with a sharp wit and little patience for the supernatural. She’s a lawyer, a master of logic and reason, and the closest thing I have to a confidante. The warm aroma of roasted beans filled the air, mingling with the comforting murmur of conversations, as she listened to me recount the dreams. I detailed the chilling familiarity of the hospital, the oppressive atmosphere, and the recurring image of Room 319.

“Maybe it’s your mind trying to process some childhood trauma,” she suggested, stirring a packet of sugar into her latte. ""You were sick, and the hospital must have been traumatic. Dreams can be weird like that. Your subconscious is just throwing all sorts of odd images at you. But going back to an abandoned hospital? That’s just asking for trouble. It’s probably full of asbestos and hobos.""

“I can’t explain it,” I said, staring into my untouched coffee, the dark liquid reflecting my own troubled expression. “It feels like… like something is calling me. Like I’m supposed to go back and face something.” I shivered, a sudden chill running down my spine. “Like there’s a purpose to this.”

Sarah rolled her eyes. “Listen to yourself. This isn’t a horror movie, Michael. This is your life. You go to the creepy hospital, and next thing you know, you’re the guy who doesn’t make it to the credits. You'll trip over a loose floorboard and die, and no one will ever find you."" She paused, looking at me with genuine concern. ""Why don't you go and see someone? A therapist could really help with this. It's probably just a simple fix, some long forgotten memory that needs to be faced.""

Despite her warnings, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the dreams were more than just my imagination, a trick of the mind. They felt like a summons, a pull I couldn’t resist, a gravitational force drawing me back to Mercy Hill. One sleepless night, as the clock ticked past 3 a.m, the witching hour when the veil between worlds is said to be at its thinnest, I made up my mind. I would return to Mercy Hill Hospital to confront whatever ghosts—real or metaphorical—were haunting me. To find whatever answers awaited me there, even if those answers shattered my perception of reality forever. I had no plan, no strategy, only a desperate need to understand.

The drive to Mercy Hill felt like a descent into madness. The sky was a bruised purple, heavy with the threat of rain, mirroring the turmoil within me. The landscape grew increasingly desolate, the familiar cityscape giving way to overgrown fields and gnarled, skeletal trees. The radio crackled with static, as if the very airwaves were resisting my approach.

Mercy Hill stands at the edge of town, its imposing structure a black monolith against the horizon. It's swallowed by overgrown weeds and vines that creep up its walls like grasping claws. The building looms against the overcast sky, its jagged silhouette like the broken teeth of a long-dead beast, a stark reminder of mortality. The windows are shattered, dark holes staring out like empty sockets, as if the building itself is blind and tormented. The paint peels like dead skin from the walls, revealing layers of decay beneath, a visual representation of the hospital's slow, agonizing demise.

I parked my car a block away, hidden beneath the branches of a weeping willow tree, its leaves brushing against the windshield like spectral fingers. I approached on foot, a heavy-duty flashlight and a crowbar in hand. Each step toward the hospital felt heavier, as though the air itself resisted my presence, pushing me back, warning me to turn away. A distant crow cried out, its call echoing through the desolate streets, a mournful dirge that seemed to herald my arrival.

The heavy front doors, once grand and welcoming, were now warped and decaying, hanging precariously on their hinges. They groaned as I pried them open with the crowbar, the sound reverberating through the empty lobby like a scream trapped in time. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of mildew and decay, a suffocating miasma that clung to my clothes and invaded my lungs. Broken glass crunched beneath my boots as I stepped inside, my flashlight beam slicing through the darkness, revealing the grotesque reality of the abandoned space. The faint remnants of old signage hung crooked on the walls, their lettering faded and unreadable, the messages lost to the ravages of time.

The lobby was a time capsule of abandonment, a frozen tableau of neglect and despair. A decrepit reception desk loomed in the shadows, its surface covered in a thick layer of dust, undisturbed for years. Chairs lay overturned, their fabric torn and stuffing spilling out like entrails, a macabre scene of disorder. The place was eerily silent, save for the occasional drip of water echoing through the halls, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the silence. Yet, despite the silence, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched, that unseen eyes were following my every move, scrutinizing my presence.

I pressed onward, the flashlight beam a fragile shield against the encroaching darkness. The graffiti on the walls didn't just tell stories; they screamed them. Scrawled in what looked like dried blood were the words: ""The Doctor Lies,"" ""They Feed on Souls,"" and a recurring image of a mirror shattering. Each message resonated with a chilling familiarity, confirming my worst fears about Mercy Hill.

I paused before a room labeled ""Infirmary,"" the door hanging crookedly on its hinges. A rusty crib lay overturned inside, a tattered mobile dangling precariously above it. As I stepped closer, I heard a faint lullaby, a mournful melody hummed by an unseen presence. It stopped abruptly as I entered the room, leaving me with a lingering sense of unease.

The deeper I went, the more the hospital seemed to resist my presence. The corridors twisted and turned, leading me in circles. Doors slammed shut behind me, trapping me in dead ends. The temperature fluctuated wildly, from bone-chilling cold to oppressive heat. It was as if the building itself was alive, fighting to protect its secrets.

My childhood memories, once hazy and fragmented, began to surface with disturbing clarity. I remembered the endless nights spent in a sterile hospital bed, the fear of being alone in the dark, the unsettling feeling of being watched. I remembered a kind nurse named Mrs. Davies, but when I tried to recall her face, it dissolved into a grotesque mask, her eyes burning with a malevolent glee. Was even she tainted by the darkness of Mercy Hill?

As I approached Room 319, the whispers intensified, a chorus of tormented voices clamoring for my attention. They spoke my name, beckoning me closer, promising me answers, but their voices were laced with a sinister undertone.

""Turn back, Michael,"" they whispered. ""There's nothing here for you.""

""It's a trap, Michael. He's waiting for you.""

""Don't trust the mirror, Michael. It will show you your worst fears.""

I tried to ignore them, but their words burrowed into my mind, planting seeds of doubt and paranoia. Was I doing the right thing? Was I strong enough to face the horrors that awaited me? Or was I just a fool, walking blindly into a trap?

The closer I got to Room 319, the more I questioned my sanity. Was this all just a dream? A delusion brought on by stress and unresolved trauma? Was Mercy Hill real, or was it just a figment of my imagination?

I stopped before the door to Room 319, my hand trembling as I reached for the knob. The whispers reached a crescendo, a deafening cacophony of screams and pleas. My heart pounded in my chest, threatening to burst. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and pushed the door open.

The room was small and cramped, the air thick with the stench of decay and despair. The only light came from my flashlight, which cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist around me.

The figure in the mirror wasn't just a man; it was a grotesque parody of humanity. His skin was stretched taut over his bones, his eyes sunken and black, his teeth jagged and yellow. His hospital gown was tattered and stained, clinging to his emaciated frame like a shroud.

He moved with an unnatural fluidity, his limbs bending at impossible angles, his head lolling to one side like a broken doll. His voice was a raspy whisper, a chilling blend of human and something inhuman.

""Welcome back, Michael,"" he said, his lips curling into a sinister smile. ""I've been expecting you.""

He didn't just tell me his story; he forced me to experience it. I saw his life flash before my eyes, a tragic tale of broken dreams, unfulfilled potential, and devastating loss. He was once a brilliant surgeon, dedicated to saving lives, but a series of personal tragedies led him down a dark path, into the depths of drug addiction and despair. He ended up in Mercy Hill, a broken man, stripped of his dignity, his body ravaged by disease.

The hospital didn't just kill him; it consumed him, twisting his soul, transforming him into something monstrous. He became a tool of the hospital's darkness, a guardian of its secrets, a tormentor of its victims.

The mirror wasn't just a reflection; it was a portal, a gateway to another dimension, a window into the depths of the human soul. It showed me my worst fears, my deepest insecurities, my darkest desires. It tempted me with power, with knowledge, with the promise of escaping my own pain.

The struggle wasn't just physical; it was psychological. He tried to break me, to shatter my will, to convince me that I was just like him, destined to be consumed by the darkness. He preyed on my fears, my doubts, my regrets, exploiting my vulnerabilities, twisting my memories.

He revealed the terrible truth about Mercy Hill: it was a place of unimaginable horror, where unspeakable experiments were conducted on unsuspecting patients, where souls were tortured and broken, where the veil between the living and the dead was thin. It was a place where evil thrived, feeding on the pain and suffering of its victims.

He offered me a choice: join him in the darkness, become a tool of Mercy Hill, and escape my own pain. Or resist him, fight against the darkness, and risk being consumed by it.

The choice was agonizing, but I knew what I had to do. I had to resist. I had to fight. I had to save myself, and perhaps, even save Mercy Hill.

Leaving Room 319 was like stepping out of a nightmare and into a waking hell. The corridors were no longer just dark; they were filled with shadows that seemed to move with a life of their own. The whispers were no longer just voices; they were a deafening chorus of screams and pleas, driving me to the brink of madness.

I followed the figure's instructions, searching for the old west wing, the room with the altar. As I ventured deeper into the hospital, I began to see them: the other souls trapped within Mercy Hill.

They were not just ghostly apparitions; they were tormented beings, trapped in a perpetual state of suffering. Their faces were twisted in agony, their eyes burning with a desperate hunger. Some were former patients, their hospital gowns tattered and stained, their bodies emaciated and broken. Others were doctors and nurses, their faces contorted in macabre smiles, their hands stained with blood.

They tried to stop me, to dissuade me from my mission. They told me that it was hopeless, that Mercy Hill could never be saved, that I was destined to be consumed by the darkness.

But I refused to listen. I knew that I had to keep going, that I had to reach the altar, that I had to break the connection, even if it meant sacrificing myself.

As I moved deeper into the hospital I began to see that others were caught up in the terror of Mercy Hill. There was the young boy who was killed in the 1960's and had roamed the halls since, a woman who committed suicide following botched cosmetic surgery and Dr. Henry Long, a doctor who killed many patients over a period of years. Their stories became my story and it was something I would never forget.

As I fought my way through the hordes of tormented souls, I saw a figure standing in the shadows, watching me with a knowing look. It was an old woman, dressed in a nurse's uniform, her face lined with wrinkles, her eyes filled with a deep sadness.

""You can't save them,"" she said, her voice a raspy whisper. ""They're too far gone. They've been consumed by the darkness. You need to leave. Save yourself.""

""Who are you?"" I asked, my voice trembling.

""I'm a survivor,"" she said. ""I escaped Mercy Hill, but it never truly left me. It haunts me every day of my life.""

She warned me about the altar, about the power it held, about the price I would have to pay to destroy it.

""It will test you, Michael,"" she said. ""It will try to break you. It will show you your worst fears, your deepest insecurities. It will tempt you with power, with knowledge, with the promise of escaping your own pain. But you must resist. You must stay strong. You must never give in to the darkness.""

She disappeared as quickly as she had appeared, leaving me alone in the darkness, her words echoing in my mind. I knew that she was right. The altar would be my ultimate test. It would be the crucible in which my soul would either be purified or destroyed.

The old west wing was a labyrinth of decaying corridors and crumbling rooms, each more terrifying than the last. The air was thick with the stench of decay and despair, the silence broken only by the dripping of water and the frantic beating of my heart.

Finally, I reached the room with the altar. It was a large, imposing chamber, bathed in an unnatural darkness. The air crackled with energy, the atmosphere heavy with a sense of impending doom.

The altar was a massive stone structure, stained with blood and covered in cryptic symbols. A dark, swirling vortex hung above it, a well of pure malevolence, radiating an aura of power that threatened to overwhelm me.

I knew that this was the source of the hospital's darkness, the focal point of its evil energy. I had to destroy it, even if it meant sacrificing myself.

As I approached the altar, the room came alive. The shadows writhed and twisted, taking on grotesque forms. The whispers turned into screams. The tormented souls surged towards me, their faces twisted in agony, their eyes burning with hatred.

The figure from the mirror appeared before me, his eyes glowing with a malevolent glee.

""You can't stop me, Michael,"" he said, his voice a chilling whisper. ""This is my domain. My power is absolute. You're just a pawn in my game.""

He unleashed his power, bombarding me with visions of my worst fears: my failures, my regrets, my insecurities. He showed me a world where I had never been born, where my loved ones were happier without me, where my life had been meaningless.

I staggered backward, overwhelmed by the darkness, my will to resist crumbling. I wanted to give up, to surrender to the despair, to let the darkness consume me.

But then, I remembered the words of the nurse: ""You must resist. You must stay strong. You must never give in to the darkness.""

I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and focused on the love that I had in my life, the memories of my friends, my family, my loved ones. I held onto those memories, using them as a shield against the darkness, drawing strength from their love.

I opened my eyes, my gaze fixed on the altar. I raised the crowbar, ready to strike, but the figure from the mirror unleashed his final weapon: a vision of Sarah, my best friend, lying dead on the floor, her eyes staring blankly at the ceiling.

My heart sank. I hesitated, my resolve wavering. Could I do this? Could I sacrifice Sarah to save myself?

The figure laughed, his voice filled with triumph.

""You can't do it, Michael,"" he said. ""You're too weak. You care too much about others. You'll never be able to destroy the altar. You're destined to be consumed by the darkness.""

He reached out his hand, ready to claim my soul, but then, I heard a voice in my mind, a familiar voice, the voice of Sarah.

""Don't give up, Michael,"" she said. ""I believe in you. You can do this. You have to do this. For me, for yourself, for everyone who has ever suffered in this place.""

Her words gave me strength, renewed my resolve. I knew that it was an illusion, a trick of the darkness, but it was enough to break the spell, to free me from the figure's control.

I raised the crowbar, closed my eyes, and brought it down on the altar with all my force.

I met my younger self for coffee this morning. She walked in looking a little lost, clutching her drink like it might give her all the answers she needed. I smiled—because I remember that feeling.

She told me she was struggling, that studying felt overwhelming, that no matter how much she read, it didn’t seem to stick. She was scared she wouldn’t make it, that she wasn’t good enough. I let her speak, let her spill all the doubts she carried. Then, I told her the truth.

“You’re stronger than you think,” I said. “I know it doesn’t feel like it now, but one day, you’ll sit here, on the other side, and realize you made it. You fought through the distractions, the exhaustion, the days when everything felt pointless. You’ll find a way that works for you—not flashcards, not some perfect study method, just persistence. Just you, showing up every day, pushing through.”

She looked skeptical. I laughed because I remember being her, doubting everything. But I also remember the shift—the moment I decided I wasn’t going to let fear win.

Before she left, I told her one last thing. “One day, you’ll be in beast mode. And you won’t just be hoping to pass—you’ll know you will. Trust me. I would know.”

 Just picked up a new script for ritalin, took my first dose, and bruh. I feel like I can think without having an annoying tik tok song playing in my head and thinking about pigeons while i try to do my homework and pound back coffee and red bull like its water, but I also feel so tired 😭 
I'm honestly just crying rn, because of just how normal it makes me feel. I can't believe I spent most of my life unmedicated and whiteknuckling life, being abused and avoided and taken advantage of by so many people for being myself.

 I wanna send out some love to y'all rn and ask for some support myself, because the struggle is real and honestly this community is so supportive and helpful. Adhd is so freaking disabling in society, even if it has its definite perks of stuff like creativity and enthusiasm. We are in this together.

I'm really stressed right now because my mom definitely has adhd too and she is a hardcore drug addict and a horrible person. The fact that i feel so okay on ritalin is crazy and it's kinda triggering me rn. I need some reassurance that a medication that I need isn't an addiction or the start of one or anything. I'm just on a normal dose and I don't feel a desire to try and get amped up, I just wanna feel like a human for once and function in school.

After a decade of training across the globe to be the world's best coffee connoisseur, Vienna Corretto finds herself back in her hometown of Seattle, Washington thanks to a mysterious note left anonymously, beckoning her to return. She procures a job at a failing coffeeshop,The Grind, which tragically burnt down 25 years ago. But Vienna has a secret, the shop previously belonged to her parents who perished in the fire, and along with them any connection Vienna had to her lineage. Two and a half decades later, the shop is now owned by Henry Kacang who despite his dream of participating in the Roast With The Most compeition, has anything but a clue on how to brew a proper cup of joe.  
  
Vienna's expertise and knowledge of the coffee trade takes it from a *coffeeflop* to *crema the crop*. But her world is turned upside down when a murder takes place on home turf, propelling Vienna into a world of battling underground spy organizations. She is tapped by the C.A.F.E. to combat the shadowy, distasteful actions of the T.E.A. All of a sudden, Vienna is stirred up in a world of covert espionage.  
  
Vienna is a steel trap on the surface, but a wash of anxiety and torment underneath, as she dives deeper into the rabbit hole of clandestine operations. Seemingly over-assured and overqualified for nearly every situation life throws at her, she begins to open up emotionally as she rekindles her relationship with her highschool sweetheart, Arabella Chai. But what would a blossoming romance be without a mysterious detective entering the mix who makes Vienna's mouth water? Or how about an unseen ex coming to town from Vienna's past whose intentions remain unspoken? Love triangle-schmiangle. Vienna's trapped in a love rhombus... a love TRAPezoid if you will. Normally this would be just another Tuesday for Vienna, but with the added tension of spies, secret missions, and murder... all the ingredients start to become a lot to swallow in this nonstop pour over.  
  
In Cold Brew is a satirical coffeeshop mystery that refuses to let up on the humor while french pressing the action forward at every chance. A delicious dark roast that has a lingering aroma begging for a second cup to be brewed. From start to finish, the story has its own tongue in its cheek, delivering chuckle after smirk after grin.

If you're familiar with Overdurf’s work, you know he’s a master at creating tools for personal evolution—and *Psychotropic Grooves: The Third Guna* is no exception.

# Why Should You Listen to Psychotropic Grooves: The Third Guna?

Music has the power to influence our mood, but this album takes it a step further. Each track is composed with an intent to create ""music for the mind,"" stimulating deep thought, emotional release, and even altered states of consciousness. Whether you're meditating, working, or just unwinding after a long day, this collection can enhance your experience in ways that traditional music simply can’t.

# When is the Best Time to Experience It?

One of the best things about *Psychotropic Grooves: The Third Guna* is its versatility. You can listen to it:

* During meditation to deepen your practice
* While working to enhance concentration
* As a relaxation tool before bedtime
* Whenever you want to explore altered states of consciousness through sound Each track ranges from five to nine minutes, making it easy to incorporate into your daily routine.

# Where Can You Use These Tracks?

Unlike traditional background music, some tracks in this collection require active listening. The subtle variations in tone and frequency create effects that work best when you truly immerse yourself in the experience. Whether you’re in a quiet space at home, wearing noise-canceling headphones in a coffee shop, or even using them in a guided meditation session, the possibilities are endless.

# How Does This Album Work?

By blending hypnotic rhythms, ambient sounds, and intricate layering of tones, John Overdurf creates a musical experience that can shift your state of mind. Some tracks induce relaxation, while others might stimulate creativity or introspection. The more you listen, the deeper the effects become, making this an evolving experience rather than just a one-time listen.

Whether you’re a fan of sound healing, meditation, or just exploring new ways to enhance your mental state, this collection is worth diving into.

I'd love to hear others' thoughts/recommendations as well. Anyway, here we go...

You may find that the cooling unit is a pain-in-the-ass and ultimately unnecessary. Ppl claim it gunks up really quickly as well. I've never even used mine. 

Also, there are quite a few after-market stems that are great. For best-bang-for-you-buck, I love the ""GRAV 16mm Octotaster w/silicone skin."" 

Not only does the skin protect the glass, but it doesn't get hot so you're not scorching your lips. You can also load your stem, cap the skin, and take it on the go to hit whenever convenient.

I grabbed 2 w/skin and then also grabbed 2 ""GRAV Upline Tasters."" The silicone skins can be rotated between the Octo and the Upline so I'm generally changing stems as needed. A couple in the iso bath for cleaning and a couple in-use. 

There are plenty of other options, but for the price as well as performance, I haven't found better. I can't even imagine not using the skins anymore, particularly if you're on-the-go.

My treat-yourself-at-home favorite is the ""Tinymight XL Cooling Stem"" from VGoodiez. For only $22, I haven't found better. 

If you're interested in running through water/dry bubbler etc, VGoodiez also sells the ""Tinymigh.t_bowl"" which is awesome. 

I pair mine with the ""GRAV Coffee Mug Bubbler,"" as I saw the t_bowl creator using it on one of his INSTAGRAM videos and figured if he's using it then he must approve. I'm also a coffee fiend and just like the aesthetics. It comes in multiple colors, has a wide base and handle so it's not easily breakable, and it's easy to clean. I know there are a bunch of bubblers etc to pair with the t_bowl, so feel free to recommend others if you have a favorite.

The pilled stems and spiral stems are also cool but pricier... as well as currently sold out.

Finally, get yourself some extra screens. I like both the rimmed basket screens as well as the conical screens (both sizes). VGoodiez sells all this stuff aside from the GRAV stems and Bubbler.

Sorry for the long-winded rambling but after about 6 months of use, these cover all the bases for me. 

Hope some ppl find this useful and like I said, ppl feel free to add your recommendations and/or yell at me if you think I'm a moron or disagree. 🤣🙏",2,1739421119.0,Tinymight2,0,0.67,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iob1if,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPublicServants/comments/1iob1if/looking_for_advice_on_acting_position/,Looking for advice on acting position,"Hi everyone, I am currently in a AS01 indeterminate position. I’ve worked in the same place for 8 years. Although I have expressed wanting to move up and do more in my section, I’ve never been given the opportunity. I have always been told I am not ready by my manager. I understood for a long time, but it has started to become discouraging. It feels like I get passed on for opportunities that get given to others. As much as I am happy for them, I do feel sad that I am not given a chance to prove what I could do especially after years of expressing my interest and making it known that I want more. There isn’t much room for growth. On the other hand, I absolutely love my colleagues. They have become some of my best friends in the world. We go for lunch together, coffees, hangout outside of work. My section is an absolute BALL. We celebrate Halloween, do fun social activities together. I am always smiling at work. 

Recently an expression of interest was released for a different position from mine for a 16 month  acting positing in a different section, that is still at level (no change in pay). I expressed interest and had a chance to speak to the manager of that area for information, where I learned that the skills I’d learn would be a great way to buff up my resume. Not to mention, this section is larger and there would be more opportunities for me to excel my career, learn and use this experience to qualify for future opportunities. 

My manager had reservations about me taking this position (saying I am not ready) but when I spoke to the manager in the section about who I am, they believed in me and wanted me. After a formal interview, I was offered the position. Since it moved very fast, I asked if I could be given until Monday to accept my offer and give it some thought, and the manager was very receptive and happy to do that. 

Since then I have been on and off crying about the loss of leaving my section, and missing my friends. Feeling worried because I know things won’t be the same and we will drift apart. It makes me feel a lot of sadness. At the same time, it’s become apparent that advancement where I am now isn’t possible. I also feel anxious because I have been so comfortable in my role, that the idea of learning a whole new thing with a new team after years of comfort is intimidating. 

I was wondering if anyone here has ever gone through something similiar: choosing between comfort (and happiness) in a role and choosing a new risk that could be amazing and could also be not amazing, but comes with more opportunity. I would appreciate advice. Although I know I will likely accept my offer, I just want to hear any insight or assurances from others who have experienced this.

I set the crossovers (see picture) and speaker distances and let the Denon S970H do the rest.

Put on some Atmos content from Apple Music and the surrounds just dont sound as good. I’m thinking I may have to set the gain higher with the on wall speakers to make up for the increased distance from old surround bookshelf on coffee table to on wall behind couch.

Five hours ago was I just minding my business, eating my lunch and enjoying a nice turkey sandwich my mom made me yesterday before it was irreversibly ruined by this one girl who decided it would be a good idea to sit next to ME. She was reading something on her phone; I recognized the layout of an AO3 fanfic. I, personally, am quite an afficionado of AO3, so I turned and asked her, “Hey, what are you writing?” like a nice, normal person would, because I’m usually a pretty nice guy. She gets all embarrassed about it — pretty understandable — but I try to comfort her, saying I read fics on AO3 literally every day and stuff, so then she finally opens up about what exactly she was indulging in: a shiny new My Hero Academia coffee shop AU shipping Deku with the pink bitch.

I was shocked. This girl and I, we are red-blooded Americans, for fuck’s sake, so I knew she wasn’t oblivious to red-blooded American politics of the modern day, and I even pointed it out to her just so she knew that I knew that this straight shipping was a very fucked thing for her to do. She got all freaked out and defensive over her clearly wretched writing, and then she LEFT, taking my appetite for the turkey sandwich with her. I was distraught.

This experience has opened my eyes to the fact that there are so many insensitive straight people to all the queer erasure going on in literature and art of our society, and that I truly need to stand up as a hero and oppose this chaos by focusing on the acclaimed freedom of speech site of AO3 and encouraging everyone on it to stop writing about straight people. We are at the end of our Roman Empire, the whole world watching us knows that heterosexual people have nothing new and everything null to contribute to our culture now, so we must end the creation of their arts once and for all with less sweaty het sex and more sweaty gay sex(which I am writing, by the way. I know damn well it’s that straight romance bullshit that’s taking away all the attention on my fics and worsening my statistics and getting it closer to being forever forgotten). If I can accomplish getting all straight fics banned off AO3, I know I will be surely be at complete and utter peace as politics continue to change through the next 10 years, and my sweaty gay sex will finally get the acclaim it deserves.

Are there any that do online order ahead? I have to drop off 3 little kids all at different places on my way to work, so the convenience of Starbucks being one tap, and a quick run inside has kept me there.

1ioatts,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ioatts/first_time_chemex/,First time Chemex,"So for the last 10 years or so I've been very lazy or ""functional"" with my coffee I started out with just your standard bodum pour over 8 cup with whatever filters I could get at the local Walmart. 

I would do 2 tbsp of whatever random preground coffee I bought at the store for every 6 ounces and pretty much just pour boiling water over it. My daily was 4 tbsp coffee 12 oz water. I put exactly 12 oz water into my boiler and just use it all. 

I got a Chemex 3 cup recently. No grinder or anything so I just have Starbucks ground the coffee I buy. I got the veranda blend and asked for a pour over Chemex grind the lady confidently ground up my coffee but I was disappointed it was like powder way finer than the preground Starbucks coffee I had. I did some research found out the model of ditting grinder they use. I decided to go back and ask for a ""9"" which came out much better only slightly coarser than the preground. 

Any tips on what setting ditting i should be asking for? 9 seems good but not sure ",1,1739420159.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

1ioatpr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ioatpr,MAC lip swatches Fair olive leaning warm,"1.    Crème in Your coffee: Midtone pink brown
2.    Thanks Its MAC: Taupey pink nude with silver pearl
3.    Runway Hit: Warm light coral*
4.    See Sheer: Grapefruit Pink 
5.    Business Casual: Warm Red Nude

Note: Runway Hit is discontinued but still available, especially in Marshalls. Some websites list it as a light nude in error because when it comes up on MACs website Runway shows up but switches to Velvet Teddy’s description.

On me as a pale neutral olive leaning warm with darker peach toned lips:
Coffee looks like pic. Kind of a brick it does not read darker and intense. I include it on most of my swatches as a baseline. 
Thanks a little pinker than wrist but not bad and does not go dark.
Runway bright coral like pic
See Sheer similar to pic
Business Casual goes darker and more red but not orange or pink.
Note: grey background is under a “natural daylight” bulb, white is bathroom light.",5,1739420151.0,Fairolives,1,1.0,False
