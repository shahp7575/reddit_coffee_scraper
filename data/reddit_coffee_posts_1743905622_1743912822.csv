1jslok4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/comments/1jslok4/what_should_be_done_about_civic_sense_in_the/,What should be done about civic sense in the Emirates?,"Greetings.

To start off this post, I would like to clarify that I am not an Emirati but I was born and raised in the UAE like several other people. My upbringing was in the beautiful city of Sharjah, which I consider my true home (it may not be legally, but home is home <3).

However, I am writing this post not to bash the people, but to find a creative solution for us as a community, targeting the severe lack of civic sense that we all have faced. It is out of frustration, I am just a man and all I can do is my part in this problem.

Has anyone here spent an entire day where they have not been frustrated by the severe lack of empathy, civic sense, or people just outright being selfish? What I mean to ask is to really think about it. Walking to your car? you get alarmed by racing e-scooters, cyclist, or just people randomly stopping in your path. 

There is an additional issue of ""application-gate"", every time you want to do something routine you get bombarded by ""Do you have X app"". Want to fuel your car on the way to your work? ""Do you have X app?"", want to grab a quick coffee? ""Do you have X app?"" why aren't we allowed to simply pay and move on? 

The matter of civic sense is much more serious than initially thought, it is in my opinion the main reason for aggression among the people, yet no one wants to change. Everyone complains about it, but hardly anyone wants to change it. Think about it, Standing in line for ATM? The person behind you stands so close you can feel their breath on your neck. Want to use the metro? People barge and jump in from all directions despite a clear sign telling how and where to enter/exit from. The behavior of people inside the metro itself is a topic of its own. Sometimes it's even as simple as people not being considerate. You may notice people who are confused about where to go after coming down from an escalator or exiting a door. Instead of moving to the side and figuring it down, they tend to stand there causing a massive bottleneck and rush. 

Driving has become a nightmare, reckless endangerment has become a common thing. There are two thoughts of the school about the left lane (a debate that is not the main topic here), lane merge has become an ego game, and honking is rampant at almost every junction. 

To give a small contrast (this in no way done to disrespect the UAE) I am currently visiting a populated country in the Oceanic region. A country that has a high population of both nationals and non-nationals. Yet I realized how much peaceful it is here just because people care for one another. I had an hour-long drive from the airport to my hotel through a populated city, and yet I didn't hear a single horn sound. I walked into the mall to do some shopping and not once did I have to move from my line cause the people ahead of me decided to randomly stop. I rode the local train and it was just easy. I went to the tourist destinations and walking was easy. I wasn't avoiding large groups of people blocking the way. It is like people have a natural sense of what to do in case they want to take a photograph and where to stop without causing inconvenience to others. And watching people do this, me being here for the first time I instinctively followed. This is a really positive thing I want to take home from this country.

This is what raises my question, why can't we have this in our country? It is not difficult to not inconvenience others. Park your car in a parking 10 meters away instead of blocking someone. If you're confused about where to go, step to the side. You letting me merge in your traffic lane will not mean I am better than you in any way. 

This is our home, we should lead by example as well. What hurts to me the most is, that this is sadly the case only in non-local-dominated areas of the UAE. Compare your visit to a mall in the city center to a visit to a mall in a local-dominated area. This means, this issue arises from people like myself, who aren't a national but just a residents/visitor. Why can't we collectively look out for each other and be more considerate? What changes can we start with? I would like to be a part of this change myself. Please do suggest.

The backstory: We were together for six years, she was 19 when we met, and I was 22. It was a very strong connection immediately, and we began living with each other fairly early on, more out of the necessity of us both needing housing than anything else. We had a roommate, and after about 6 months they left, leaving us to further our relationship. These were very happy times, and we ended up moving from our apartment into a rental home. 



After two years there, she became pregnant, and we were very excited. I had a new job that I enjoyed, we were very stable financially, and it seemed that everything was going great for our soon-to-be family. She kept in great health during the pregnancy, our son was born without an issue, and we were over the moon for about the first year of his life.



And then it started to change. She began having outbursts, screaming at me over very small disagreements, threatening to harm my possessions when she didn't get her way, and finally actual physical violence. She would often do these things in front of our son, had no self control, and would rage until she wore herself out. I believed that what she was going through was postpartum depression, and I begged her to see a professional as our home life was rapidly deteriorating. 



We talked it through, and at the heart of it, she was unhappy being home with our son so often. She was jealous of me going to work, she needed a break, and I understood that. So she sought out a part time job, which meant that I would have to change around my schedule a bit, but it seemed critical for us to recover. 



I cut back the hours at my job to care for our son, and she started hers. We barely saw each other, and I was struggling with that, especially after she began going out with some friends from her job a few times a week. She was doing better, she was feeling more fulfilled. And I did my best to understand that she needed this, though it came at the cost of my own mental health. Now I was the jealous one, and I started to get suspicious. 



She was constantly talking with one of her new friends, she seemed into him in more than just a friendly way. After weeks of this, I confronted her about it, and she denied there was anything going on. So I tried to believe that. Until I had an opportunity to see messages between the two of them. She had left her Facebook open on the desktop, and I couldn't help myself. I looked at their correspondences, dread filling me the entire time. There was nothing overtly sexual, though there were many things said between them that crossed the line, and it was clear that this was an emotional relationship at the very least. 



I waited until our son had gone to bed before I told her what I had seen. She wouldn't say anything, she refused to talk to me about it. And when I started raising my voice, she told me I was scaring her. When I didn't calm down, she simply took our child out of his bed and brought him to the car. When she left, I just sat down and sobbed. 



Days passed with little communication from her. I did my best to carry on, expecting her to come back, but she finally told me that she wanted to move to her mother's. I was absolutely crushed, I demanded that we talk and she denied me. I went insane, begging, sending text after text. She never replied to anything that I said, only threatened a restraining order if I kept it up. She had police escort her to the house while I was at work one day, packed her things, and she was gone by the time I got home. It dropped me into a depression that I couldn't function through, and ended up hospitalized for. 



Her mother provided the transportation for our son when I got out, and I hadn't seen D since the night she left, only communicating through text about our son's needs and scheduling meeting times. Eventually I was served papers to figure out child support and custody. And as far as I knew, I would never see her again. 



It took a long time to start to feel normal, this last fall I had gone through the motions of entertaining another love interest, but it wasn't going to work because I had never gotten over D. The way I loved her, I never imagined that I would be without her, and realizing that, it just wasn't fair of me to string someone else along. That relationship lasted a few months, and the breakup was abrupt. I do not feel good about that.



Not long after, D messaged me out of the blue, asking if we could meet and talk. At first I resisted, but she was persistent, and we met for coffee after a few days. There she apologized, for everything. She told me about her bipolar diagnosis and the medication that she had started, the therapy that she was in, and explained how lost and regretful she had been after leaving me over the past years. I accepted her apology, gave my own, and we left with tears in our eyes. 



I didn't fully comprehend the emotional toll that conversation was going to have on me. There was still a mutual attraction, despite everything that had happened between us. She had said that she would be interested in being friends and spending time together. I fought that urge until I couldn't bear the thought of cutting her out. So we went on a few walks, we talked on the phone for hours, had extremely honest conversations, had nice dinners, etc. It has been going very well since. We see each other once or twice a week, and we have begun to have sex again after a couple months of deciding if that was something we both felt comfortable with.     



A lot of me wishes that she would have gotten the help she needed while we were living together, and there is some resentment with that. We were both young, and I have thought that if we had been able to figure out ourselves better before having a child that this may have prevented the way that things happened. I've considered that we may need couple's counseling, especially for our son's sake, if this is going to turn back into a committed relationship. We have not told him, we have not spent time as a family yet. I think there's still too much to consider before we make that decision. 



I suppose I'm looking for opinions on the entire situation, especially if this is similar to anything somebody else has dealt with. Where do we go from here?

 The alley reeked of burnt rubber and gasoline. The sharp bite of copper hung in the air, thick and cloying—the unmistakable scent of fresh blood. James Carter knelt beside the crumpled body of the armored truck guard, his leather gloves tacky with the man's blood. The vest hadn't saved him. The round had gone clean through the side, missing the Kevlar by an inch. Sloppy luck. Or maybe just cruel precision.

 The man's eyes were still open—vacant and glassy, locked in that final, startled stare. James carefully reached over and closed them with the back of his knuckles. It was a small, almost reverent gesture, one he had performed more than he cared to admit. A practiced, almost mechanical gesture. His fingers lingered for a beat longer than necessary, and then he drew his hand away, flexing it absently. He felt nothing, not anymore.

 Footsteps sounded behind him, crunching softly against broken glass. James's hand instinctively drifted toward the gun holstered at his hip, his fingers brushing the worn leather grip before he registered the familiar voice. 

""You always this quiet at crime scenes, or am I just lucky?"" 

The voice was light, teasing, but the footsteps were steady— unshaken by the corpse or the blood. That made him glance over his shoulder. Sam Bennett was standing just outside the circle of crime scene tape, watching him. Her dark brown hair was pulled back into a low ponytail, a few loose strands sticking to her temple. The edge of her jacket was dusted with the alley's grime like she hadn't cared where she stepped. She was dressed for the job: black boots, navy pants, and a tactical jacket zipped halfway up, but her face still had a softness to it—a trace of the idealism James no longer carried. She didn't look hardened. Not yet. She held his gaze for a second too long, waiting for him to answer.

 James didn't answer. Instead, he pulled the edge of his leather glove tighter over his wrist, standing slowly. He could feel Sam watching him, waiting for some kind of reaction, but he had none to give. He glanced at the guard's bullet-riddled chest–center mass, professional, no hesitation. This wasn't a random hit. It was practiced. Controlled. 

Sam crouched beside the overturned armored truck, fingers tracing the scorch marks along the door's edges, her brow furrowing. ""Explosives,"" she said quietly, running her hand along the blown hinge. ""Precision charges. Clean detonation—small blast radius. They knew exactly where to place them."" 

James stepped beside her, his eyes narrowing slightly. The acrid stench of the explosion still clung to the metal, but she was right—the damage was calculated. Controlled.

""Military grade?"" she asked, glancing up at him.

James shook his head. ""No. Too clean. They used shape charges—designed to cut through steel, not splinter it.""
He crouched beside her, running his gloved fingers along the edge of the blast. The cuts were sharp, almost surgical. His jaw tightened slightly. ""This wasn't some smash-and-grab. It was professional""

Sam's gloved hand hovered near his for a moment, her fingertips nearly brushing his. She didn't seem to notice, but James did. He pulled his hand back.

She glanced toward the body behind them, her eyes flickering with something sharper this time. Not quite fear. Not yet. But far from it.
""They executed him,"" she muttered. She stood slowly, brushing her hands on her jeans as if trying to rid herself of the crime scene grime. ""The vest didn't even matter. They were aiming for the gaps.""

James's throat tightened slightly. He didn't want to look at the guard again. He knew what he'd see: precise grouping, mid-center mass—two in the chest, one in the head. The kind of grouping only professionals managed.

He scanned the alley again, the prickling unease settling deeper in his gut. The crime scene was too neat–no scattered evidence, no careless footprints or shell casings. The shooters had taken their time. Covered their tracks. It was meticulous.

Too meticulous

Sam's voice pulled him from his thoughts. ""They planned this, didn't they?"" She wasn't asking. She already knew.

James didn't answer right away. He slipped off one glove, running his bare fingers over the edge of the door hinge, feeling the cool bite of the twisted steel beneath his touch. The alley was quiet except for the distant murmur of voices beyond the crime scene tape, the low hum of a radio, and the occasional crackle of static.

Finally, he spoke. The tension in his spine made his movements slower than he intended. His eyes lingered on the bloodstained asphalt, then drifted toward the scorch marks on the door.
""They're just getting started,"" he said quietly.  

The distant wail of sirens echoed faintly down the alleyway, their snap pitch muffled by the city's dense sprawl. The forensics van turned the corner, its headlights briefly illuminating the blood–spattered pavement before rolling to a stop. The back doors creaked open, and two crime scene techs in navy blue jackets began unloading their kits with mechanical efficiency. 

James barely glanced at them. He was still staring at the hinge on the armored truck's door, the sharp, clean cut where the shape charge had sliced through metal like butter. Too neat. Too fast. Too practiced. 

Beside him, Sam straightened, rolling her shoulder once. She was still favoring her left arm slightly from a fight they'd been in two weeks earlier, and James' eyes flicked to the motion. A brief, involuntary check. She was fine. She didn't need him fussing. He shoved the thought aside.
The forensic lead, Jesse Patel, ducked underneath the yellow crime scene tape, walking briskly toward them. His face was shadowed with stubble, his dark hair sticking up in odd directions like he'd been woken mid-shift. He was holding a clipboard in one hand and a disposable coffee cup in the other–probably stale, probably cold. He took one glance at the armored truck, then at the guard's body, and his mouth flattened into a thin line.

""Hell of a mess."" His voice was flat, almost bored. He crouched beside the body and peeled back the guard's vest, confirming what James already knew. ""Vest was useless. It was a clean shot right through the lateral gap. Shooter knew what they were doing.""

Sam crossed her arms over her chest. ""Any chance they left a casing?""

Patel shot her a look. ""These guys? Doubt it.""

He was right. James had already scanned the asphalt when they arrived. The shooters had been too thorough to leave anything behind. Still, Patel nodded at his team, and the techs began sweeping the ground with slow, deliberate movements, metal detectors humming softly in the background.

James felt Sam shift beside him, her eyes tracking the forensics team as they worked. She was good at this–quiet, observant. He could see the gears turning in her head, the methodical way her eyes moved over the scene. She was cataloging details the way he used to before he stopped caring about being thorough.

She walked a slow circle around the armored truck, her boots crunching softly over the broken glass. James watched her from the corner of his eye, forcing himself not to follow.

Don't hover, he reminded himself. She doesn't need a babysitter.

Instead, he turned his attention to the ground. He crouched low, running his fingers over the edge of the scorch marks again. The metal was still warm beneath his glove, but something else caught his attention–a faint, oily residue near the base of the hinge.

He pressed his thumb against it, then rubbed it between his fingers. Grease. No–industrial lubricant. His stomach tightened slightly. That wasn't from the truck. The shooters had coated the hinges before placing the charge–a trick used by military or ex-paramilitary crews to reduce friction and ensure a cleaner detonation.

He exhaled slowly, a quiet breath through his nose. The realization hit him with a slow, dull weight. These weren't just common criminals. They were professionals.

He felt a shiver run down his spine as the cold reality of the situation dawned on him. They had a homicide on their hands, and the suspects were so thorough, they had no way to trace anything to anyone. 

He was zoned out in his thoughts, thinking about ways to catch their potential killer. He was taken away from his thoughts when he felt a tap on his shoulder, it was Sam. She spoke, saying,"" I just got a call from the precinct, they may have found a suspect to our homicide.""

James straightened slowly, his brows knitting together as Sam's words sank in.

""A suspect?"" His voice was low, edged with skepticism. ""Already?""

Sam nodded, but the furrow in her brow mirrored his own doubt. ""Anonymous tip came in ten minutes ago. Someone dropped a name and a partial plate tied to a van spotted near the scene just before the explosion.""

He didn't answer immediately. Instead, he turned his gaze back to the armored truck, then to the body, then to the faint trail of scorched rubber leading out of the alley. Everything about this scene screamed precision. Clean. Clinical. The kind of job that didn't leave behind witnesses or license plates.

""If someone left a name,"" he said slowly, ""it's because they wanted us to find it.""

Sam glanced toward the end of the alley, where the crime scene techs were finishing their sweep. ""I know. It's too convenient."" She pulled her phone from her pocket and tapped the screen, her thumb hovering for a second before she turned it so he could see. ""But this is the guy they want us to look at—Danny Clarke. Minor offenses. One weapons charge. No military record. No crew history. He's...basic.""

James stared at the photo—mid-thirties, twitchy eyes, a jaw too tight with nerves. Not the face of someone who could pull off this kind of surgical job. He'd seen amateurs before. Danny Clarke reeked of desperation, not discipline.

He exhaled slowly and muttered, ""He's either a pawn or a body waiting to be dropped.""

Sam gave a grim nod. ""They're bringing him in now. Should be at the precinct in thirty. I said we'd be there to question him.""

James nodded once. ""Good. I want to look him in the eye.""

They stood in silence for a moment, the weight of what they weren't saying pressing in between them. Neither believed Clarke was their guy. And both knew exactly what this meant: the real players were already two steps ahead.

James glanced toward the crime scene one last time. The blood was still wet. The scorch marks still fresh. But whatever trail had been here? It was gone. Wiped clean.

""They're testing us,"" he said quietly.

Sam gave him a sideways look. ""Think we passed?""

He didn't smile. Just pulled his glove tighter and murmured, ""Not yet.""

Then he turned, walking back through the tape without looking back, Sam falling into step beside him as the distant hum of sirens gave way to the cold, anticipatory quiet before the next move.

The game had started. And someone else was already holding the next piece.",1,1743912061.0,writers,1,1.0,False

so it started from this vid i saw on tiktok, some dude posted about this telegram server that sold prop money, but not that OBVIOUS fake stuff that says “motion picture use only” on it. these ones were $20, $50, and 100$ bills and only had the word “COPY” on it. the vid got taken down like the next day so i knew it was prob sketchy but i was curious.  i joined the telegram cause i was lowkey down on 🌳 (ifykyk) and dude was sellin $1000 in prop cash for like 30$. there where many options but i wanted it all in 20s. i figured 20s were less sus than like 50s or 100s so i copped it. when it came in the mail, it actually looked real. like not perfect but scary close. only thing was it felt off and the COPY stamp stood out bad.
so i got a little creative. 

i used some acetone and a q-tip and carefully rubbed the COPY part off. it actually worked after a few tries. just had to not scrub too hard or it’d mess the ink. then i soaked the bills in some strong coffee and used a blow dryer while kinda scrunchin them up to give them that crinkly look real cash has. they looked way less sus after that. i even took a nail buffer and kinda sanded down the edges a bit. made the bills feel less smooth n more used. then i found out that if u spray like the lightest coat of hairspray on the front and let it dry, the fake marker pen they use at stores won’t really work right. it just doesn’t show up or fades super fast. only problem was when u hold the bill up to a light, it’s obvious it’s fake. no stripe or watermark or any of that. so i only used em at gas stations, little corner stores, Some Less known plugs, or food trucks—places where no one got time to check that deep. I’d buy like $5-10 of stuff and pay with a fake $20, act chill, and get real change back. One time the dude barely looked and handed me back like $15 real cash. i never hit the same place twice with fake money and only used like 1 or 2 bills a day just to be safe. in the end i made around $300 in real money from changin them out. then i got paranoid and stopped. i still got a shoebox with a bunch of the bills somewhere lol.

1jslivn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeoriaIL/comments/1jslivn/peoria_local_bike_rides/,Peoria local bike rides,"Hi all,

I do a lot of cycling around here, and there was some interest in another post on the group rides available. This is probably not a comprehensive list, but it covers a lot of them.

Bike helmets are generally expected or required.

**Chill rides**

You can probably do these if you can bike for an hour. We won't leave you behind.

* **Bike Peoria Night Rides**
   * These occur on the first Friday (usually) of every month, year round.
   * Free / no registration required.
   * Start at Bike Peoria Co-op near Main and Sheridan, same building as Basket Case. 8 PM.
   * Get comfortable riding on the roads at nights.
   * Lights required. If you show up without lights, you may be able to purchase some from the Co-op.
   * Typically an hour at a 10 MPH pace or whatever the slowest rider can do, around campus area and West Peoria, seldom any big hills.
   * There are events on the [Bike Peoria Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/BikePeoria/events).
* **Bike Peoria Breakfast Rides**
   * These are generally the second Saturday of each month, from about March to November. Starting time may vary, but typically 8 AM.
   * Free / no registration required.
   * Each ride is to a different local restaurant for breakfast or brunch.
   * Starting point varies to keep the distance reasonable, typically 5-10 miles each way (30 minutes to an hour.)
   * There may be hills. Someone will wait for you or ride with you if needed.
   * There are events on the [Bike Peoria Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/BikePeoria/events), and also a schedule [here.](https://bikepeoria.org/events/breakfast-ride-series/)
* **Pedal Peoria Ride Series**
   * These are on most Thursday nights from about May to August, 6 PM. Starting point varies.
   * Free / no registration required.
   * Explore Peoria's art. science, nature, and history by bicycle.
   * Typically 8-12 miles, 2 hours, 1-2 steep hills.
   * Schedule will be [here](https://bikepeoria.org/events/pedal-peoria-ride-series/), but as I write this the 2024 schedule is still up.
* **Trek Store Coffee Rides**
   * These are most Saturday mornings at 7:30, but no guarantee. Very informally organized.
   * Free / no registration required.
   * Ride from the Trek Store on Sheridan to various local coffee shops for coffee and/or food. Typically about 5 miles each way.
   * Generally a little faster than the three ride series above, but still unhurried.
   * Join the [Coffee Outside Peoria (IL)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/184821413908481) Facebook group and check Friday night for a post. It's generally just that, not a FB event.
* **Beers & Gears**
   * Annual event, the biggest fundraiser for Bike Peoria & the Co-op. June-ish.
   * Registration required, cost \~$25-$35.
   * Ride with hundreds of people to various establishments serving beer along the Rock Island Greenway.
   * Go your own pace. Have fun!
   * Event page [here](https://bikepeoria.org/events/beers-gears/).
* **Ride of Silence**
   * The Ride of Silence is an international event promoting road safety and remembering those killed or injured on our roads.
   * Always on the [third Wednesday of May](https://bikepeoria.org/events/ride_of_silence/). Organized by Bike Peoria.
   * This is a short and very slow ride, completely in silence to show respect. We will have a police escort.
   * The last few years it has started and ended at Tower Park in Peoria Heights.
* **Bushwhacker Whacky Wednesday**
   * I don't know much about this. Chill Wednesday evening ride in nicer weather. Stop by Bushwhacker and ask.

**Longer rides**

You should be able to ride for several hours, but you don't have to be super fast. If you can do \~12 MPH for a while, you've got these.

* **No Baloney**
   * This is one of the longest running local rides, put on by the IVW (Illinois Valley Wheelm'n.) August-ish.
   * Registration required, typically \~$30-$50.
   * Multiple ride options, e.g. 20, 45, 65, 100 miles.
   * Snacks and drinks are provided at stops on the ride, as well as SAG (roadside service) if needed.
   * Hundreds of riders. Typically starts and ends at the Kennel Lake Sportsmen's Club near Morton.
   * Event page is [here](https://ivwnobaloney.com/). 2025 registration is already open.
* **Meet in the Middle**
   * Long-running event. Peoria area cyclists and Bloomington-Normal area cyclists all ride to Mackinaw. Usually in September.
   * 60+ miles for the whole thing. Typically people start from near the trail at Pioneer Parkway, pick up more people near Bushwhacker, then downtown Peoria, then Morton.
   * The group usually splits into faster and slower riders, but you can probably find a group to hang with if you're capable of this distance.
   * I can't find an event page for this. Check the [IVW](https://ivwheelmn.org/wordpress/) and [Bike Peoria](https://bikepeoria.org/events/calendar/) calendars closer to September.

**Faster rides**

You know who you are. Can you go 20+ MPH for a while? Do you want your legs ripped off?

* **Trek Peoria Monday Night Rides**
   * 6 PM at the Trek Store (N. Sheridan Rd. at W. Ridge Rd.) on Mondays from about April to October.
   * Maybe call or message them to be sure, especially if the weather is iffy.
   * Typically 25-30 miles, mostly on roads.
   * You might get dropped.

**Other rides & resources**

These are either irregular, or I don't know enough about them.

* [IVW](https://ivwheelmn.org/wordpress/) has a web page and schedule with rides. They ride mostly on roads and have formal [ride levels](https://ivwheelmn.org/wordpress/?page_id=218).
* [Peoria Outdoor Adventure](https://peoriaoutdooradventure.com/biking) has a biking page more comprehensive than my list here. Also follow on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PeoriaOutdoorAdventure). We have done some great rides like bikepacking from Peoria to Johnson Sauk State Park (north of Kewanee) to Starved Rock, and back to Peoria over three days.
* The Peoria Area Mountain Bike Association (PAMBA) has an [events calendar](https://www.pambamtb.org/events-calendar). There is loads of great mountain biking in the Peoria area.",2,1743911959.0,PeoriaIL,1,1.0,False

I absolutely love and adore him but he is an extremely strong willed child. Will not take no for an answer , is not easily distracted from anything and absolutely wants what he wants. I come from an abusive (both physical and emotional) home so I often have to step away and take deep breaths just to regulate. 
My husband and I cannot sit down to have a coffee even for five seconds before he’s screaming crying asking to be picked up. He won’t sit in the stroller unless he’s sleepy or tired. He won’t play independently . The silver linings are he’s very social and loves people and other children. So we spend most of the day at the park or playground. Husband and I take turns to do things for ourselves as it is impossible to do them together without him having a meltdown. We’ve tried to include him in the activities like cleaning and folding but he has a meltdown when we tell him no (like trying to stick his hand in the washer or pull down mugs) 
 Does it get better ? Does anyone have any pointers , books etc on how to deal with toddlers sanely ? We are both only children and do not come from big families , so our exposure to actual children is very very limited until we had our son. Please help. ",4,1743911925.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False

*Time of visit: April 5th, 2025, 10:00-11:00 AM.*

# Accessibility, Parking, and Atmosphere

It’s in the middle of a residential area which makes it great if you live there, but can make close parking somewhat challenging if you go at a time when everyone’s home. The exterior is unimpressive with the adjacent tavern shut down, but I suspect that regulars will enjoy the “local gem” factor for it.

Like many things in life, the inside is totally different from the outside. If the outside is a dilapidated disappointment, the inside is a comfy retro vibe with a psychedelic twist with several LGBTQ flags.

# Drinks

Coffee: Ordered a cortado, a decaf macchiato, and The Bee Sting (seasonal Spring menu). The espresso for the cortado was very dark to the point where not much other flavor came through. The seasonal drink was a nice riff and well balanced. Like most cafes, the sweet drinks shine brighter here. The decaf here was SOUR and the only thing I would consider a decisive negative.

Tea: We did not get a tea but we spotted one of the baristas preparing tea in a pitcher. Tea is loose leaf which is always a good sign.

Preparation and Brew Methods: No specialty methods offered (e.g. v60). That’s not a bad thing for the vast majority of people going to this cafe, but it’s worth noting to the snobs out there. For those who like to upcharge their drinks, you can change your whole milk to soymilk, coconut (!), and oatmilk. Milk seemed a tad overfrothed. 

They have self-serve water which is always a big plus!

# Food Options

You’re not getting a full meal here, but what they do have is good. Bakery snacks include various types of croissants and muffins. Big fan of the banana walnut muffin! I personally hate bagels but they got a couple of those because they always seem to be a non-negotiable for some folks. A snack and a coffee will run you around $8-10 per person.

# Who is this for?

All and all, this is a charming cafe, and if you live within 15 minutes you need to make this place a staple if it isn’t already.

**Best for:**

* Casual meetups with friends and family
* Quick coffee runs with your dog
* LGBTQ and hipsters

**Not Ideal for:**

* Students - a lot of the desks are on the larger side, and the single chairs don’t have a desk for a laptop. You’ll either be a jerk or uncomfortable.
* Large groups - it’s a cramped space. There’s maybe 2 tables that can seat up to 4.
* Coffee snobs - 95% of people who go here will like the coffee. That last 5% of nerds who use a Weiss will be left wanting.
* Dates - the environment can be noisy and there aren't many nearby activities for a second date.

*This is a brief snapshot of a cool cafe in the Tampa Bay area, and is not meant to be a comprehensive review. Let me know if there’s somewhere else you’d like a writeup!*",2,1743911919.0,StPetersburgFL,0,1.0,False

Area: NE Portland or Reed College area, we're still looking for an apartment.


Hey there! We're a neurodivergent (AuDHD) couple—27 and 28 years old, non-binary, and we're looking for a third roommate to share a 2-bedroom rental with! We're excited to find someone who's also neurodivergent (or who has an understanding of neurodivergence) and appreciates a calm, clear, direct, and open communication style.


A bit about us:

We are gamers! We enjoy gaming in a quiet way (no yelling at the screen, promise). While we love our games, we also love sleep, and we’re usually in bed by 11pm-12am.

We both have noise-cancelling headphones that we use often either for our own entertainment, or in case you need some privacy.

28-year-old loves to cook, and we’d be happy to share meals here and there.

420 friendly.

We are tidy, and won't leave a mess in common areas.

We have a shy cat who takes a little while to warm up to other animals, so we're looking for someone who can respect their space, and if you have pets they must be cat-friendly.

We have company over occasionally, and will clearly communicate about it, so no surprise visitors!

We’re nerds at heart. We love high fantasy, sci-fi, board games, card games, D&D, drag shows, and hosting game nights.

We already have our own living room furniture (couch, coffee table, side table), but you’re welcome to add anything that feels right for your space.


What we're looking for in a roommate:

Neurodivergent (or understanding of neurodivergence)

Clear and direct communication. Being direct is key for us as neurodivergent folks

A tidy person who respects shared spaces and is cool with occasional company

1jslee0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RainbowGhostMew/comments/1jslee0/heres_your_content/,Here’s Your Content,"It started like any other political press conference—overblown, underwhelming, too many cameras, and coffee that tasted like boiled regret. The President of the United States was ten minutes late, which gave the reporters plenty of time to whisper rumors and rehearse gotcha questions.

I stood near the back, chewing on a pen cap, notebook in hand. My name’s Dani Reyes, 26, staff reporter at The Post-Ledger. I’d been covering the White House for two years, but this one felt… different. Tense. Like the air before a thunderclap.

When President Clara Vex finally walked onstage, something about her vibe was off. Hair slightly disheveled, blazer unevenly buttoned, a wild glint in her eye. The woman had made a name for herself as the first stand-up-comedian-turned-politician to win the presidency. But today, she looked less like a commander-in-chief and more like someone about to lose a bet.

She didn’t even wait for the press secretary to settle the crowd. She just grabbed the podium and growled into the mic.

“You want content?” she said, voice low but cutting. “You want to analyze every blink, every word, every sneeze? Fine.”

Then came the moment.

She reached into a box beside the podium—none of us had noticed it before—and pulled out a thick stack of paper. With a twisted smile, she started flinging them into the crowd like confetti.

“Here’s your content!”

Pages fluttered like broken birds. People gasped, ducked, reached up to catch them. Chaos. Cameras flashed. A few Secret Service agents stepped forward before clearly deciding they’d seen worse.

I snagged one mid-air.

So did Rory, the political desk’s caffeine-addicted wunderkind. So did Lena, my best friend and video editor, who was only there to capture B-roll. Each of us looked down at our respective sheet. We compared later.

Mine had a joke. A one-liner in Courier font:

“What’s the difference between Congress and a circus? The animals in the circus are trained.”

No signature, no heading, just that. I stared at it, unsure if I should laugh or worry.

Rory’s was different. A detailed two-paragraph summary of a real, looming crisis: a brewing debt-for-water deal between the U.S. and a Central African nation, with deep implications for corporate overreach and international law.

Lena’s? A full-page outline of a 12-step domestic policy overhaul titled “The Reset Plan.” Education, energy, prison reform, surveillance limitations, voting accessibility—clear, logical, radical.

We regrouped in a nearby coffee shop, papers clutched like sacred texts. “This is insane,” Rory kept saying, over and over. “If this is real…”

That was the thing. Was it?

There were no headers, no White House letterhead, no digital trail. The press office issued a bland statement calling the stunt “performance art” and “not representative of policy.” Cable news spun it every way imaginable. Late-night hosts had a field day.

But the pages. They were real. Too specific, too thoughtful to be throwaway scribbles. But also too random to be policy leaks. Right?

We tried verifying Lena’s page. Nothing in the legislative pipeline matched. Rory spent nights cross-referencing his sheet with classified briefings leaked years ago—came up empty. My joke? Turns out Vex had used that line at a comedy club fifteen years ago.

The question wasn’t just “Is this real?” It was: Would anyone believe us even if it was?

No one would run with it. Editors scoffed. Conspiracy theorists grabbed on, but they always do. We were left with three pieces of paper and a gut feeling that something huge had just happened—and everyone missed it while chasing clicks.

Vex never mentioned the stunt again. She carried on like normal. Approval ratings went up. The world spun on.

But I still carry that page in my bag. Folded, faded, nearly forgotten.

Because someday, someone might ask what it was like the day the President lost her mind—or maybe told the truth—and gave the media exactly what it asked for.

And I’ll say: “She threw it right in our faces.”",1,1743911500.0,u_RainbowGhostMew,0,1.0,False

I've been dating Jake (24M) for about a month, and things have been amazing - he's thoughtful, makes me laugh, and we have great chemistry. The only red flag? The man runs on caffeine like a Tesla on battery power. We're talking 4-5 energy drinks daily plus multiple coffees. He's admitted this gives him heart palpitations and his doctor warned him to cut back, but quitting cold turkey has been tough for him.  

Things came to a head last weekend when I brought him to family dinner. Everything was fine until my mom caught him cracking open his third Monster at the table. When she asked about it and he casually mentioned his caffeine-induced heart issues, she went full ER doctor mode.  

""You're going to give yourself a heart attack before 30!"" she snapped. ""This is completely irresponsible!"" My dad piled on, calling him ""immature"" and saying no grown man should be drinking like a frat boy during finals week.  

Here's where it got messy. When I tried to defend Jake (""He's working on cutting back, it's not that simple""), my mom dropped the nuclear option: ""If he can't even control something this basic, you need to break up with him. Do you want to be dating a walking health crisis?""  

I lost it. I told her she was being ridiculous and controlling, that one bad habit doesn't define someone's character. Now my parents are furious, saying I'm ""choosing some caffeine junkie over family"" and that I'll ""regret it when he's in the ER."" My mom keeps texting me articles about energy drink-related deaths like that proves her point.  

I get they're concerned, but demanding I dump him over this after just one month feels insane. AITA for refusing to break up with him over his energy drink addiction?  

TL;DR:My new boyfriend drinks too much caffeine and has minor heart issues because of it. When my mom found out, she demanded I break up with him immediately. I refused and now my family thinks I'm an idiot.  ",12,1743911241.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

1jslafs,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jslafs/16m_failure_of_a_son_no_future_in_sight/,(16m) Failure of a son. No future in sight.,"Second time typing this as I forgot to save draft and left for coffee. That was definitely not fucking annoying and totally didn't make me consider jumping.

Anyway,

I'm pretty much a failure at everything. I don't talk willingly, not even to my parents or siblings. I sit and stare while normal people talk and enjoy themselves. I'm easily used, tossed aside, pretty much a stupid, submissive tool. Parents are abusive and manipulative(I think?), Especially my dad. He's emotionally immature, manhandles, holds me by my neck and pushes me around. Also a massive hypocrite. He doesn't hit me though, not anymore, at least. He says he loves me. I know it's a lie.

I desperately want affection, intimacy, any form of support or love. Nobody gives any. It's so bad, I imagine vividly enough to almost feel touch. I'm gay, but my family and extended family are all christian or of an adjactent belief. Not a good mix. My dad suspects, even tells me he wouldn't care if I was. I know, however, from the way he speaks about them, that he's lying. He'd want me dead, if he doesn't already.

Being the oldest, I'm supposed to set an example for my younger siblings, but look at me. I'm failing most of my classes, have been since my freshman year, and there's no chance of fixing my gpa in time for graduation. The only non-failures have been more artistic paths. I take digital photography, and In just 4 months I've recieved more compliments and praise than my parents could ever give. This is the only class where I've had an A in years. I used to make consecutive honor rolls so easily. Now I can't even pass.

My mom is... okay. She doesn't do half the things my dad does, and we even agree on certain things about him, but she enables his behavior. I used to ask her for help, and it was like she never cared. I stopped. They argue, but for their own reasons. I'm an afterthought, except when they need me. They finally remember I exist, only to drop some work or task on me. Speaking of work, not sure how I'll get a job. I don't even want one. I have no ID or driver's liscense, and I need money in order to get one. No resume, not that I know how to make one. I don't know the first thing about employment. Who the fuck came up with this?

Sometimes it gets so bad I cry the moment I'm alone. I want to break things, but I know I can't. I sit there, overwhelmed with everything that bothers me and falling apart Imagination doesn't help or comfort me at that point. I've considered self harm, suicide, even murder to get out of this hellhole. Usually too afraid or weak. Can't even make a small cut. Whenever a gun or knife is in sight, I find myself staring, tempted to grab it and end myself right there. It never happens. Weak as always. There's this stupid idea I have where someone takes care of me, handling my needs like a pet or something. It'd be better than this, I bet.

These are just some of the problems, there are many more but I'm too lazy to type it all right now. I know this sounds weird. I'm weird. Never done anything like this before, so yeah. I'll take advice or read anything you wanna say, go right ahead.",2,1743911099.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1jsl7i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1jsl7i8/you_like_attention_do_you_here_let_me_get_you_some/,"You like attention do you? Here, let me get you some.","So I am telling this story because the friend involved recently died from a short but valiant battle with Cancer. She went from the doctor saying ""Well, we need to do a biopsy, its probably nothing"" to a call from her 5 weeks later saying she was going into Hospice car, with just a few days to live. But saying goodbye brought up some tough memories, and a funny one.

24 Years later and I go to a Meetup. A Tiki club that met weekly, but not only at Tiki bars. 50's style diners were also part of the club.  It was at a local dessert place with a 50s diner flair that also serves some good coffee. I think this is my second or third meetup with them and it is a good group. Several them rode motorcycles or even Vespa scooters, as I did, an old 70s Honda CB550 4-4.  I sit down with my coffee and am talking with one of the guys who just bought a new Triumph Bonneville when someone comes up to the table, sits down and takes drink of my coffee. What the actual fuck?

I look over, and it was, to my utter astonishment, Wayward.

Wayward, which was her nickname, was an old girlfriend. We had a short but enjoyable summer together after I graduated from HS and she was working before going off to college.  She went off to college, me to the Navy, and we lost track of each other. This being the days before the internet.

I had been married for 15 years at this point and had a child. While she was single it was a strange, but platonic, friendship that revolved around the Meetup club. The Dessert Diner was a favorite, and every time I would get a coffee, she would steal it and drink from the other side. It was a ""thing"" we had.

It was a good way to get out of the house as I worked from home, and that could be isolating. But it was not without it's problems.

One of the older women in the club was a real attention whore and instigator. She *really* did not like Wayward, who wasn't out there causing her problems, but Wayward did a lot for the club and it ""showed up"" Ms. Attentionslut.

My wife? Well she had no interest in the club, and she saw it as a chance for her to hang out with her friends down the street or have them over. She thought the thing with Wayward was cute and charming. My wife has zero jealous bones in her body and *cannot stand attention whores*. She laughed when I told her the latest Ms. Attentionslut's antics. Oh and a true Redhead's temper...

So several years of friendship and the club go by, with various amounts of harassment and whispered rumors by Ms. Attentionslut. It was the yearly club planning dinner, and Ms. Attentionslut had had more than her share of box wine.

Wayward, who got tied up with a patient and was late, came in after the dinner and gave me a hug. Ms. Attentionslut said in a loud stage ""whisper"" to everyone ""Gee, I wonder what Ms. Raccoon would think of that. Maybe someone should tell her.""

I saw red. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed my wife. ""Oh, you have something to say to my wife, do you Ms. Attentionslut? Let me help you out here."" I put it on speaker phone.

""Hey honey, someone here has something to say to you about me and Wayward.""

""Oh? Hand me over to her, dear.""

And when Ms. Attentionslut tried to say something, Ms. Raccoon let her temper fly. She read her the Riot Act, mocked her, ripped her up one side and down the other... and told her to keep her nose out of other people's business if she liked the way it looked. She would never hurt anybody, but it *sounded* like she would, and that was what counted.

The club heard it. It grew silent. Ms. Attentionslut was imitating a fish out of water. She was turning even pinker than the wine could account for and Ms. Attentionslut was imitating a fish out of water making ""ah ah ah"" sounds.

Then my wife started to laugh, which her laugh is very infectious. Other people started to laugh. Ms. Attentionslut started to *really* turn pink, then ran out of the room. A 60 year old woman crying like a toddler.

Well, in the spirit of the Tiki Club, here is to you Wayward... fair winds and following seas.

Here are things I've noticed in my time here:

• Going from washing dishes with gloves on and transitioning to making food with the same soapy, wet gloves

• Tasting sauces in the middle of food prep (licking gloved fingers) and continuing to make food with the same wet glove
    • Also double-dipping that same finger into the sauces

• ""Washing"" a bamboo cutting board with the soapy dish sponge, then wiping it off with a wet watery (not sanitized) rag 

• Dropping a knife on the dirty kitchen floor and continuing to use it in food prep

• Filling the customer water dispenser (spout towards bottom) in the mop sink 

• Touching face/nose/hair with food handling gloves on and continuing to use them

• Scraping the bench scraper off on the inside of the Compost bin (I think just gross??) Gets used OFTEN on our food prep surface

• Prepping food, pausing to take orders at the front register with the same gloves, and then returning to food prep, same gloves

• Setting a container on the floor then setting it on the food prep cutting boards

• Wiping the edge of customer mugs, to clean drips of coffee, using the counter-wiping-down rag on the mouth area

• Wet-coughing directly into our ice machine 🤢

• Never sanitizing the not-dishwasherable items (large plastic carafes, knives, etc) just handwashing with soap & water",3,1743910678.0,healthinspector,1,0.8,False

What happens to the mind of a person when they’re overwritten by an Agent?

The *M*atrix films don’t fully explain the subjective experience of someone being possessed by an Agent

When an Agent possesses someone, it’s like their consciousness is instantly overwritten. One second they’re a dude or woman drinking coffee, next second, boom. Agent Smith. Fight Neo. It’s never said to be like demonic possession where they’re trapped in their own head watching the horror. It appears to be more like ""Mind: overwritten. Consciousness: terminated.""

The original person probably doesn't experience anything past the point of takeover, they just… *stop existing*. If the Agent leaves the body, maybe the person wakes up disoriented (if they weren’t killed during the Agent’s time in the body), or maybe they never come back. I don't know which is why I'm here. maybe you guys don't know either. Maybe there is no explanation.

I want to know your guy's thoughts, theories, or even actual answers.

My theory is that they’re just recycled, like unplugged humans whose bodies are turned into biofuel for the system. The person never wakes up, and their life was terminated and flushed the moment Agent Smith took over their vessels. Even if it doesn't make much sense, I believe their connection is just terminated immediately, even if the Agent survives, I believe the body is just flushed instantly, no explanation, no experiencing what's happening. Just instantaneous death. 

Edit: Some answers may respond with ""They just become Agent Smith.""

What I'm looking for is what happens to the body of the person that is possessed. Do they get flushed like Neo was supposed to? Or do they forget every single thing and get reborn.

Other comments on other post in another sub-reddit have mentioned how ""everything that happens in the matrix is planned."" and ""Anyone who ""accidentally dies"" is fed to anyone else in the real world once they are flushed."" But like my post says, what happens to possessed civilians, seemingly living in a regular world at one moment, and hunting down this random guy in a black trench coat the second.

What happens to the body though? Are they flushed immediately and just replaced with more code of Agent Smith, or does that body of him disappear even if he survives Neo's encounter?",1,1743910286.0,matrix,2,1.0,False

* 2Y: 3.64%
* 10Y: 4.00%
* 30Y: 4.41%

**Fed Outlook**

* The Federal Reserve remains watchful on inflation pressures, with recent data suggesting a firm stance on further rate moves if pricing trends fail to moderate. Short-term yields are trending sideways but remain sensitive to any new guidance from policymakers, highlighting ongoing caution in the bond market.

**Top Headlines**

* U.S. Tariff Announcements:On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump declared a “national emergency” concerning the U.S. trade deficit and announced a universal 10% tariff on all imported goods, effective April 5, 2025. Additionally, higher “reciprocal” tariffs were imposed on approximately 60 countries, with rates varying based on perceived unfair trade practices. For instance, China faced an additional 34% tariff, bringing the total to 54% on Chinese goods.

* Economic Outlook:Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the tariffs are likely to result in higher inflation and slower economic growth. Economists have expressed concerns about increased risks of recession or stagflation due to these trade policies.

* Market Reactions:The stock market experienced significant declines, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 2,100 points and the Nasdaq entering bear-market territory. These movements erased trillions in market value and raised concerns about a potential global recession.

**Trader’s Edge** “The market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.” **Mindset Tip for Traders This Week:** In a market ruled by fear and volatility, discipline is your edge. Stick to your plan, size your positions wisely, and don’t let noise shake your conviction. Survival > hero trades. Control risk. Stay focused. **Market Wrap-Up: Week Ending March 28, 2025** **This week, the market got caught in the crosshairs of policy risk and macro panic.** President Trump’s sweeping tariff declaration and China’s aggressive 34% retaliatory strike threw gasoline on inflation fears and recession risk. Markets unraveled fast — the Nasdaq plunged into bear market territory, the Dow shed over 2,100 points, and over $6T in market cap was erased across indices. SPX dropped 9.1%, NDX 10%, and DIA 7.9%. Even Bitcoin couldn’t dodge the risk-off avalanche, closing the week down 3.7%. Volatility surged. The VIX spiked 50.9% to 45.30, and VVIX jumped 23.2%, signaling not just panic, but panic about more panic. SKEW faded slightly, but protection demand remains intense. Options flow confirms the hedging—Put/Call Ratio is pushing toward extremes (0.95), and Max Pain for SPY sat well above reality at $550. ETF flows show clear defensive rotation: money fled growth (SPY -$8.28B, QQQ -$232M), trickled into energy (XLE +$335M), and bailed on financials. Sector performance echoed the pain: Tech, Energy, and Materials were battered hardest, while Health Services and Staples proved relatively resilient. Sentiment? Brutal. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 4 – pure Extreme Fear. Traders are in survival mode. Protection over speculation. Discipline over emotion. Next week brings key CPI, PPI, and Fed minutes — all of which could be powder kegs. Until then, don’t fight the tape. Navigate with caution, hedge your exposure, and walk above the storm. Stay sharp. Stay disciplined. **— WaterWalkers Investments**",1,1743909779.0,u_WaterWalkersLLC,1,1.0,False

1jskv4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ellykatstans/comments/1jskv4i/paul_blart_and_the_soup_scandal/,Paul Blart and the Soup Scandal,"It was a brisk Tuesday afternoon at the West Orange Mall, and Paul Blart was cruising along, doing his usual rounds. The mall was bustling with shoppers, kids running through the aisles, and the faint scent of pretzels and cinnamon buns filling the air. As Paul glided past the food court, he noticed something odd—there was a long line at the new soup stand that had just opened.

Soup? Paul thought. Who needs soup when you've got pizza, burgers, and ice cream?

But the line was growing, and the aroma of freshly made broth and simmering vegetables lingered in the air. Paul couldn’t help but be curious. He stopped his Segway and wheeled over to the stand.

“Excuse me, miss,” Paul said, addressing the young woman behind the counter, who was ladling soup into a bowl for a customer. “I’ve got to ask—what’s so special about this soup? It seems like people can’t get enough of it.”

The woman, a friendly-looking college student with a name tag that read ""Rachel,"" smiled. “Oh, this isn’t just any soup. This is The Soup of Legends—a secret recipe that’s been passed down through generations. People say it has healing powers.”

Paul blinked. Healing powers? He didn’t know what was in this soup, but it sounded like something he needed to investigate further. Maybe this was the next big thing in food court cuisine. Or maybe… something more suspicious was going on.

Just then, a man in a business suit approached, holding a bowl of soup. He was an obvious regular—clean-shaven, sharp-looking—but his face was turning an unusual shade of red.

“Hey, are you alright, sir?” Paul asked, noticing the man’s discomfort.

The man coughed twice, then looked at Paul, eyes wide. “This soup… I’ve never felt so alive! It’s like a fire igniting in my soul! I… I can’t stop!” He immediately took another spoonful, his eyes glazed with bliss.

Paul’s instincts kicked in. Something was off here. He had to get to the bottom of this soup phenomenon. He nodded at Rachel. “I’ll take a bowl of your legendary soup.”

Rachel looked at him suspiciously but handed over a steaming bowl. “On the house, Officer Blart. Enjoy!”

Paul took a cautious sip. It was… definitely good. Rich, savory, and filled with a complexity that felt both familiar and strange. His taste buds were dancing, and for a moment, he felt like he could run a marathon.

But then, a peculiar feeling washed over him. His hands started to shake slightly, and his heart raced faster than usual. Was it the soup, or was this some kind of side effect? He hadn’t felt like this since the time he drank two large iced coffees before his morning patrol.

“No… no way,” Paul muttered. “This can’t be happening.”

He quickly placed the bowl down and looked around. The mall was busy, but more and more people were now crowding the soup stand. Some were eating quietly, while others looked as if they had just discovered the secret to eternal life.

It was time for action.

Paul pulled out his walkie-talkie and spoke quickly. “This is Paul Blart. We’ve got a situation at the food court. The soup… it’s got something in it. I need backup. And maybe… some crackers.”

Within moments, Paul was joined by his trusty fellow security officers, and together they surrounded the soup stand. But as they approached, something even stranger happened—the stand began to glow. It wasn’t the warm glow of a lamp or the soft flicker of neon lights—it was the soup. The bowls on display were shimmering in an unearthly way.

""Rachel!” Paul shouted, his voice stern. “I need you to tell me what’s going on. This soup... what’s in it?”

Rachel took a step back, her eyes wide. “I... I didn’t mean for this to happen. It was supposed to be just a nice soup—my grandmother’s recipe. I didn’t know the effect it would have on people.”

“Effect?” Paul asked. “What do you mean by effect?”

Before Rachel could answer, the mall's manager, Mr. Stevens, burst into the scene, holding his own bowl of soup. His face was flushed, and he looked completely ecstatic. “This soup is brilliant, Blart! Absolutely brilliant! We’ve just signed a contract with the soup company—this is going to be the next big thing! Imagine it, Paul: Soup of the Future!”

“Soup of the future?” Paul repeated, eyes narrowing. “What’s really in this soup, Stevens?”

Mr. Stevens waved him off. “Don’t you get it, Blart? It’s all natural ingredients! Organic vegetables, spices… and a secret ingredient from an old family recipe.”

“That’s what I’m afraid of,” Paul said. He stepped forward and grabbed a ladle, dipping it into the soup. “I need to find out exactly what’s going on here.”

With careful precision, Paul took a sample of the soup and quickly brought it to the mall’s on-site lab technician, Janet. After a quick analysis, Janet called Paul into the back office.

“Well, Paul,” Janet said, adjusting her glasses, “I think you were right. This soup contains a rare combination of herbs and spices that cause a temporary state of euphoria. People are basically getting addicted to it.”

Paul’s eyes widened. “So… it’s like a drug?”

“Exactly,” Janet replied. “People get hooked after just a few sips. They’re so euphoric, they don’t even notice what they’re doing. It’s probably why the whole food court is going crazy for it.”

Paul nodded thoughtfully. “We need to shut this down. But… maybe after I have one more bowl. Just to be sure.”

Back at the stand, Paul confronted Rachel and Mr. Stevens. “I’m afraid I’m going to have to shut this down for good, folks,” Paul said. “The soup’s got a dangerous side effect, and it’s going to have to be pulled from the menu.”

“But… the customers love it!” Mr. Stevens protested. “This is going to make us millions!”

“Not if it’s turning them into soup-obsessed zombies,” Paul shot back. “I’m doing what’s right for the mall.”

With a reluctant sigh, Mr. Stevens agreed to close the soup stand temporarily, and the customers who had been happily slurping away were slowly coaxed into moving on to other food options.

As Paul walked away from the scene, a small smile crept across his face. It had been an unusual day, but as usual, Paul Blart had saved the day.

“Now, about those crackers,” Paul mumbled to himself, glancing at the food court. “Maybe a little chicken noodle soup wouldn’t hurt…”

And so, Paul Blart saved the day once again, proving that not even a soup scandal could shake his mall cop determination.",1,1743909540.0,ellykatstans,0,1.0,False

I've been noticing him for quite some time, he's cute and there's something in him that made me feel warm inside whenever we talked even though it was just some small conversations or I was ordering. 

The first time I talked to him when I saw him tending to some stray kittens, as someone who loves cats, seeing that basically melted my heart. 

Yesterday we kinda ""had"" our first official talk when we asked each other several questions but then he had to rush back to waiting tables. He was so cute and it was so calming talking to him. 

I'm usually a shy person so I don't know how I should ask him to have a drink with me after work. I was thinking something like ""Could I invite you for a drink after work?"" but I don't know. I've never done this before lol. What spiking my anxiety was that I don't know if he's gay or not (though I'm like 70%-80% sure he is) and if he's single.

1jsks6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1jsks6v/experiencing_very_vivid_visuals_while_meditating/,Experiencing Very Vivid Visuals While Meditating,"So usually I have like this panic attacks that if I don’t deal with them they can last for like 2 or 3 days. As a response to this when I tend to listen to 417hz or 528hz and do deep breathing and usually I’ll calm down nod off and wake up a bit better.

Tonight I had to do this again. I used this breathing technique learnt from entering focus 3 in the hemi-sync tapes. The one of breathing in new energy through your nose and old energy out your mouth with a hum is tune with the music. I did that for about ten minutes before I stopped breathing out through my mouth and rather through my nose in a loud hum.

Sooner or later I was lucid but not dreaming. But it was weird because usually I would hear the audio playing.
I was well aware or semi aware of my body. I was still receiving external stimuli but I wasn’t there?

Like there was like I dunno this weird display. Like I was looking directly at it. I can’t explain what I was doing there but it was all going so fast. Like I was communicating with people I could tell and managing what felt like data or something. I just remember feeling so sure and certain of what ever I was doing even though now I can pinpoint or explain anything. It was like I was aware of my physical body and stuff but it was so irrelevant. I remember seeing like this blue crystal like structure in the middle of whatever display I was seeing and it had a metallic shine to it and responded to what ever data I was taking in or out from whatever I was communicating with.

Ultimately suddenly the music stop playing because my earphones died and it didn’t feel like waking up more like leaving when you stop starting at your computer at work to go get a coffee and it feels like your zapped out of something but I don’t really understand what happened. I left well rested but I never slept and I feel calmer so it’s a win.

Does anyone understand what that is?

1jsks3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1jsks3x/seeking_for_an_advice_how_to_figure_out_whats/,Seeking for an advice: how to figure out what’s making me unlikeable and how to fix it,"Noticeably I’ve lost all my friends. Up until college, I was surrounded by people. So much conversations, supports, events, etc. After 30s, married with no kids, I have nobody to talk to. Not much really changed from before. 

What’s worse is that nobody WANTS to talk to me. They’re usually excited at first, and slowly stop talking to me.

There are very obvious signs I’m doing something wrong and/or something unlikeable for sure. They like me at first and then not anymore is the sign. 

Here are some reasons I thought of:

My story telling is boring. I’m always outdoor doing my stuff, i should have so much to talk about. Except I underplay my stories, assuming nobody is there to really care to hear about me. I make all stories too short. 

I don’t expand the conversation in the “right way”. Listening to somebody rant and vent is easy. But when it comes to my turn to talk, it’s bland. Some people call it ADHD but instead of sticking to the topic, I talk about something new. This is where I think people feel like their topic was ignored, and I feel bad.

My voice is quiet. I sound very anxious and not confident at all. It’s hard to fake it.. but that shouldn’t make people move away from me necessarily?

Comparing too much. I notice my talks are often comparing one thing to another when I could just talk instead of “what about it?”. It’s a habit of my husband and I guess I got used to it. 

I don’t remember a lot of things. I’ve watch so many movies and shows but I never remember the title or the characters. When we talk about the movie, I kinda notice I’m not channeled right with the other person. What they want to talk about seem different and I couldn’t figure out what. Or how to bring it up. 

I notice people aren’t particularly enjoying what I have to say. It’s difficult to just blab for me now. Overthinking was not something I did before, and it’s allI do now. Everyday I used had multiple people to call and text, got invited to events and hangouts. After 30s, I just lost everyone. 

After few months of no contacts, I started to notice myself kinda being even more awkward. Talking to coffee shop people even became difficult. My voice got so quiet I always have to repeat myself… I feel so bad.

I hit up old friends and we’re excited at first, but they end up not really liking me either and I see it. I really want to know what Im doing to become like this. 

I think this is part of my problem, I laugh too much. Or I’m too excited. I do calm myself and stay quiet but it makes me get jumpy with the conversation topic and kills the mood.

1jsks37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AccutaneRecovery/comments/1jsks37/putting_the_argsk3b_theory_together/,Putting the AR-GSK3B theory together,"Summary is Gemini produced because I am a lazy person. Important in **bold**, my comments in (paragraph)

  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
**Initiation:** Drugs like Finasteride, SSRIs, or Accutane trigger tissue-specific stress (e.g., perceived androgen deprivation) and/or disrupt key signaling pathways regulating GSK3B activity (e.g., PI3K/Akt, Wnt).

1. **AR Adaptation:** Affected cells adapt by overexpressing the Androgen Receptor (AR) gene, leading to AR protein accumulation and profound hypersensitivity to androgenic ligands. (Already confirmed by a PFS study, same mechanism has been observed many times in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer)
2. **Functional Estrogen Blockade:** The dominant, hypersensitive AR signaling interferes with normal Estrogen Receptor (ER) function, causing tissue-level hypoestrogenic symptoms, like anhedonia, via impaired ER-dopamine modulation. (Strong androgens straight up give you anti-estrogenic effects, very common knowledge. Because the AR is overexpressed, any amount of androgens inside you blocks estrogen from working in ***affected*** tissues)
3. **GSK3B Potentiation:** Active GSK3B pathologically phosphorylates the overexpressed AR protein, significantly reducing its degradation (increasing stability) and amplifying its signaling potency. (And the AR on its turn raise GSK3B locally. You see the cycle yes? one potentiates the other, GSK3B protects the AR from degradation)
4. **Epigenetic Entrenchment:** GSK3B contributes to establishing and actively maintaining a stable, maladaptive epigenetic state (altered DNA/histone marks) that perpetuates AR overexpression and aberrant gene activity. (I wont pretend to be an expert of epigenetics, but everywhere I look says the same: GSK3B is a very strong modulator of it and high means methylation. So not only it protects the current ARs, it makes sure the next batch will come in the same amount)
5. **Androgen Sensitivity Paradox:** Normal/high androgen levels worsen symptoms by activating the hypersensitive AR; castration provides maximal relief by removing the ligand. (yay! except, well, we are suddenly recreating the initial enviroment of androgen deprivation ..... risking the same process happening again. Temporary benefit -> ""crash"". But note, this process requires GSK3B)
6. **Supraphysiological Androgen Nuance:** Transient supraphysiological androgen peaks (like in BAT) may offer temporary relief by potently activating Akt, which acutely inhibits GSK3B, briefly overriding the receptor saturation effect. 
7. **Cortisol/Stress Aggravation:** Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which acts via the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) to potentially further increase GSK3B activity, exacerbating the core pathology. (We have some issue with cortisol, we just do. In CRPC, Glucocorticoids receptors are overexpressed)
8. **Estrogen Crosstalk Complexity:** Problematic ER signaling likely involves ERα (potentially activating AR via MAPK), whereas therapeutic potential might lie with ERβ (CNS benefits); non-selective estrogen activation is risky. (This is important: estrogen seems to help and following the logic here it should be easy to see why. So lets think about it, you inject estrogen, that lowers your testosterone production which is good for reasons that should be easy to understand now, it also activates the estrogen receptor bringing the balance closer to estrogen. So now your anhedonia finally improves. But wait, ERa activation amplifies the effects of the androgen receptor, so now yes you have less testosterone, but the already overexpressed hyper sensitive androgen receptors just became hyper hyper sensitive, so if before you had 500 test that was ""worth"" 5000 and doesnt let estrogen be, now you have 100 test that is worth 4000 and also doesnt let estrogen be, but maybe slightly less only)
9. **GSK3B Inhibition Rationale:** Directly inhibiting GSK3B aims to destabilize AR (promoting degradation, reducing signaling) and remove a key factor maintaining the epigenetic lock, allowing potential cellular reset. GSK3B inhibition kicks the AR out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm.
10. **Autophagy Rationale:** Inducing autophagy actively clears the accumulated/stabilized AR protein pool **in the cytoplasm** and associated cellular damage, synergizing with GSK3B inhibition to facilitate recovery. 

  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So yeah. This makes complete sense of my personal experience, like complete. I cant speak for everyone of course.

It also explains why it is so fucking hard to fix, is a cycle that is difficult to break. Is not neccesarily that GSK3B is high systematically, I dont think that is, is that the high amounts of AR ""amplify"" any amounts of GSK3B (I could be wrong about this). But on top of it we all have seen that simple ""windows"" (GSK3B inhibition) doesnt mean cured, when it goes back up most ARs just go back to where they were. 

GSK3B inhibition + autophagy (yes, fasting) seems like a very strong move. The more serious of a case you are the longer you need to spend in that state. Mild disfunction tbh you probably do some glp agonist and dont eat for a week and done. More serious cases I think you need lithium at *minimun* as is the only direct inhibitor we have available for now. Of course the problem is comibining lithium with anything is a nightmare. Even lithium and fasting can be dangerous if you dont know what you are doing.

AR degraders would also be a direct fix, but again, not comercially available

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Anyway a list of stuff that helps

**Lithium Carbonate** (please for the love of god spend an entire day learning how it works. What inhibits GSK3B is **concentration of elemental lithium** itself. If you are taking 300mg and then eating salty food all day and drinking your 10th coffee you are doing absolutely nothing. This is also why lithium alone can not work for a serious case: the amount of lithium concentration you need to cure you would either make your life hell or kill you. I am pretty sure some of you has PAS anhedonia, take high dose lithium, cure the PAS anhedonia but now have lithium anhedonia, and think lithium doesnt work)

**VPA** inhibitor of gsk3b. HDAC too

**Tirzepatide** AKT up -> GSK3B down

**Rapamycin** careful

**Metformin** 

**HGH** careful if combined with lithium, fluid retention and can accelerate your thyroid function, increasing t4 to t3 conversion, which is great for us, but t3 accelerates the speed your kidneys clear lithium, and as I just said what matters is how much lithium you have in your body at each point)

Fasting is straight up great



\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
About the neurosteroids, they affect GSK3B in important ways but they are not easy to modulate all the time like we kinda need to do. But I think you should still know what they do to maybe avoid crashing.



GABA up is good, is seriously good, brings AKT up brings GSK3B down. Obviously difficult to modulate all the time. Taking a benzo all the time will backfire shortly and you will end up with worse PAS. When you think about taking something that strongly brings GSK3B down for say 2 hours, think what will happen when it comes back up just as fast.

Serotonin good

Dopamine, sadly, bad. D2 receptor activation brings GSK3B up. I know what I just said about serotonin and dopamine seems ridiculous considering our anhedonia, but is sadly true.  Want to fix anhedonia forget about simply doing dopaminergic drugs, fix estrogen activation.

Memantine and ketamine but I suggest only if you are on lithium. Ketamine + lithium is actively being researched, lithium prolongs the GSK3B inhibition of ketamine. ",1,1743909250.0,AccutaneRecovery,0,1.0,False

I'm 48 and been in perimenopause for 2 years- hot flashes, severe migraines with auras, heart palpitations, high bp (never had any issues before ) depression/rage, insomnia.. all the fun stuff. 🙄

I'm kind of desperate.   I'm isolating myself,  letting my small business fade to nothing, I get explosive outbursts.   Its miserable.  The depression and funk is real!   I also live in Florida which isn't helping with the hot flashes at all.   

I'm cleaning up my diet.  I take flaxseed oil. Fish oil. Vitamins A, D, C and zinc.  Rarely drink alcohol, love tea though,  but I cut way back on coffee.  

I can even handle the terrible weight gain compared to the rest.  It comes in waves , I'll be fine for a while, then it all starts over again.   

I had a uterine ablation back in 2020, just before covid,  so haven't had a period since.  My daughter just started her period and (don't think I'm crazy) but I think when her period is due my symptoms are worse.  Ugh.

Sorry for the super long post, I have no family here, my husband is a saint for putting up with me and I can't offload to him much more.  I needed to ""talk"" with women who get it.  

Tia for any advice.

My question has to do with the moral status of property rights when the property in question is something that was gained by removing/killing/enslaving earlier inhabitants.  This can be illustrated by a thought-example:  Imagine you are an explorer in the 1800s and you discover an island.  On it, you see great potential to grow bananas and coffee.  Everything is ideal: the temperature, the moisture, the land.  You decide to fetch 200 compatriots to come and settle this virgin territory. 

Six months later you arrive with a party of your pals with modern instruments to farm and settle this place.  When your party arrives, you are surprised to find that there are hundreds of inhabitants in what you thought was unsettled land.  You and your party, while apprehensive,  decide to move in anyway.  The local inhabitants view the land as ""theirs"" since they have lived there for centuries and their culture holds it dear.  They don't want you to set up farms on ""their"" territory (they could want their own farms or view the land as sacred etc.) and they oppose you.  This starts with shouting at you and your party and ends with them firing arrows when you oppose them.  You realize they have started a war to get you to go home and you want this land.  You retaliate with modern weaponry which decimates the tribe opposing you (they have primitive weapons).  Eventually you kill all of them, including innocents back at their village.   Now the land is yours and you happily continue farming it and making it productive.

What is the moral status of land/property acquired in this manner?  Was it OK for our plucky explorer to continue farming and modifying the land when he discovered that it was ""owned"" (no deeds etc. of course) by the local tribe?  What should he have done?  You guys will undoubtedly see that this is a simplified version of much of colonial history where land was taken from indigenous tribes. I wondered how objectivists saw the moral status of land so-acquired.  

Please note: I have asked a variant of this question before http://www.objectivistanswers.com/questions/3132/what-are-the-rights-of-undeveloped-cultures-and-their-people but I wanted to concretize the question beyond the ""how should we treat others who are less developed""?",1,1743908671.0,ObjectivistAnswers,2,1.0,False

I am looking to buy an espresso machine as a gift for a friend. And usually I like to research a lot before I do so as to get a good product. I know they want an espresso machine and they were looking for one. But I came across this subreddit and went into the espresso ideal pressure rabbit hole. I will go into details on this at the end for whoever wants to have a look at what I have been suffering from :).



Basically, I am looking for what you espresso folks and experts would consider is a good budget ($100 to $200) espresso machine, fully automatic that takes Coffee Powder.

For example DeLonghi Dedica EC685 priced at around $150

And if im understanding correctly, Ideally it should have an OPV so that the pressure remains consistent at around 9 Bars which for example the DeLonghi machine I mentioned lacks.
However, all the machines I have found also don't mention an OPV so most likely they don't have one. So if thats the case, shouldn't a 15 Bar machine be better than a 20 since the 15 is still closer to the approperiate pressure range for espresso? I know that the machine internally doesn't brew at 15 or 20 bars as that is the advertised peak pressure, but without an OPV, the machine in theory would start off near the highest pressure and go down to align around the appropriate range, so starting at around 15 is better than starting at around 20 for a good espresso.






Espresso Pressure Rabbit Hole: the 9 Bar requirement messed me up. Because why are all machines 15 Bar and 20 Bar, and the higher the Bar the more expensive. And it turns out its all advertising and marketing strategy, because ""higher pressure= better"" which is as all you guys pointed out is not the case.


But then I found out that no these automatic machines don't brew at their ""15"" or ""20"" Bar advertisements, internally they brew at around 7-11 Bar, but the 15 or 20 Bar title is their maximum capacity. But then still, these same machines, if they lack an OPV, when first brewing, they might start at their highest capable pressure and start going down from there, so they start around for example 20 Bar, and then go down to the proper range.


And then when you think about it, if I am brewing at 15 Bar, its better than brewing at 20 Bar. So if I have 2 options, between 2 machines, one 15 and one 20 and both without OPV, so both would start around their peak pressure and go down. It would be better to start around 15 than 20. So the cheaper 15 Bar machines in theory are the better machines than the 20 Bar ones.",0,1743908271.0,espresso,7,0.5,False

I (22F) started an internship a few months ago, and only a couple of weeks after that, another new intern joined. For reasons that particularly escape me, *I* was tasked with training *her.* We are around the same age, and have a similar sense of humor, so we hit it off pretty well. 

A few days ago, my internship ended, and she... Almost started weeping, to say the least. She promised to treat me to a meal (all is well until now) and then handed me a parting gift. It's such a sweet gesture, I thank her a lot, buy her coffee and hug her goodbye. Then, when I get home, I open the gift bag, and it's a perfume, two body mists, a heartfelt letter and *money.* 

First of all... Perfume?! I'm so so grateful, I wasn't expecting to get such an expensive gift, and on top of that she got me exactly the type of perfume I like, which I believe I only mentioned in passing. The best part is, the body mists are red fruits flavored, which is exactly the flavor of tea I had every day. Isn't that the most thoughtful thing ever?? The money part I am quite frankly confused about. Maybe the cashier put her change in a gift bag on accident? The letter was very sweet, but I am overall confused. 

It could be my own emotional constipation talking! But is this a normal gesture between colleagues who have only known each other for a month and a half? All my other colleagues just said goodbye with the 'appropriate' amount of fanfare. Don't get me wrong, I am *very* appreciative and would by no means imply something negative about it. I just want to understand better! 

  
Additional context that might help? 

While we had the same nationality, she did not grow up in the country. She grew up in China and studied in Turkey. Perhaps it's a cultural thing? 

She *can* speak the native language but she prefers to communicate in English, and I was the only other person who could speak it fluently. 

She called me her girl crush (I'm getting a warning from reddit so I want emphasize that this is not me seeking relationship advice or anything of the sort, really just want to understand !) and had really high praise for me all the time. Sometimes a little too much? 

If anyone can give me an insight, if maybe I should start gifting my colleagues perfumes as well T\^T? ",2,1743907914.0,CasualConversation,4,0.63,False

I want to warn other women. (TW: sexual assault)","I’ve gone back and forth about sharing this. It’s been almost a year, and I’ve spent that time trying to heal, trying to move on. But I don’t think I ever truly will. And if speaking up can stop someone else from going through what I did, then it’s worth it.

In March 2024, while traveling in Tokyo, I was raped.

It’s still hard to say that word, even though I know that’s what happened. I’ve replayed the night over and over, trying to find a moment where I could have changed things. But the truth is, the only person responsible is him.

I was in Japan with friends—first Osaka, then Tokyo, the last stretch of what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. We’d just finished a night exploring Shibuya when we met a group of Americans drinking outside. A goth-looking girl barely said ""hey"" before disappearing. One guy, Matt, struck up a conversation and said he could show us around the local ""emo bars"" the next night. He seemed friendly and outgoing. I don’t use Instagram or Facebook, so I gave him my phone number.

We were texting back and forth. When we finally met a few weeks later, my friends were too tired to go out, so I met him alone in Shibuya. When I arrived at Rockaholic, he wasn’t with any friends. Matt did all the talking. At the bar, he showed me pictures of what he said was his two-bedroom apartment with a recording studio and a cat. It looked clean and cozy—totally normal.

I had one rum and coke. He bought me another.

The next thing I remember is waking up completely naked on the floor of a filthy room. No mattress, no pillow, no blanket—just a pile of my clothes near some guitar equipment. The only furniture in the place was a dirty fridge, a TV stand with no TV, and a single bed. I had no idea where I was, but later found out it was in Chiba—far from where we started. A different prefecture altogether, and not Suginami like he’d said.

He was in the bed, fully clothed, weird TV static music playing. My phone was on charge.

I felt sick. Disoriented. Violated.

I didn’t remember getting there. I didn’t remember undressing. I didn’t consent.

When I asked what happened, he smiled and said we got drunk and had sex. I told him I didn’t consent. That he raped me. He tried to play it off, tried to put his arm around me, told me I ""shouldn’t worry"" because he didn’t come inside me and had ""cleaned me up.""

I have flashbacks of him cleaning himself off my stomach. That moment haunts me. I never said yes. I never had a chance to say anything at all.

I just wanted to get away. I grabbed my things and told him I was heading to the station. Instead, I went to the nearest convenience store, bought a coffee to calm my nerves, googled where I was. Then figured the best way back to the hostel.

Later, he sent me a picture of my necklace—one I’d looked for before I left. I know he kept it intentionally. A manipulation tactic. A way to lure me back.

When I got back to the UK, I went straight to my local NHS clinic. I was tested for everything. I was raped, and because of him, I tested positive for HSV-1 and HSV-2. A lifelong reminder.

I should have gone to the police. I should have done a lot of things. But at the time, I just wanted to feel safe again.

His name is **Matt** from LA, probably around 46 years old, though he looks older. He has a band called **FaveRiot**. When I looked him up through a friend’s account, I saw him wearing my necklace in one of his band photos. I felt used all over again.

i want to help other women and warn others. Where is best to share my story?

(again, so wrong.) 

i released the shift an hour before i was supposed to show up. during my shifts there, the two hosts that were with me kind of used me as a busser/seat people instead of teaching me the right way to rotate servers and when it’s best to start the wait list etc. i assumed my presence wouldn’t make the slightest of difference, im brand new and just a trainee. of course calling out of a shift this early on with any employer gives you an awful look, and honestly looking back on it i wish i would have shown up, just to be useless and remain in the restroom but at least i showed. about an hour and a half after 12, i get a call from the restaurant. it’s the same manager that hired me. he was.. extremely angry to say the least. “why did you not call?” “it’s common sense to call.” “i’m gonna give you a write up for this.” “im disappointed you didn’t have the common sense to call even when you’re new” (and way way more.) all of this with the most tone i have ever heard from a grown man.

while i agree with me having better common sense, and yes it absolutely was very dumb to assume the little app thingy was enough, this whole restaurant thing might not be for my overly sensitive self. im the type of person to think about one interaction for DAYS on end if i was yelled at. he asked if i was coming in the next day, i said no and told him the next day im scheduled. it sounded like a threat when he told me he’ll see me then. i’ve now here’s the huge kicker. when i interviewed with him, he hired me on the spot. i wish i saw the red flag. as i mentioned before i have another job. but this one is a family owned spot, where their employees have been there since the place opened. i’m kinda there to fill in the hours that the main crew isn’t available. that’s usually around 10 hours a week, sometimes more if im filling in. with chilis, the manager told me id be starting at 25-30 hours a week starting. key word. starting. the schedule after my mandatory training hours? 4. four hours for the next two week out schedule.

 with this place, i’m losing more than i have at my original job. and since i THOUGHT i was gonna have a consistent schedule with chilis, i gave my og job specific days id be able to work for them, since i didnt have a huge schedule there anyway. i feel bad for wasting these people’s time, but after that phone call i deeply feel i was never meant to be there. maybe im just not used to corporations being more.. blunt? again i 100000% know and believe my mistake and fully recognize he’s right about not taking the step to call. but being spoken to the way i was makes me afraid to show up again. 

if im not even getting the hours i was told, and i had more before i cut them FOR THIS PLACE.. is it even worth it to stay? here i was thinking i landed a balanced work schedule in this shitty job market.. just to deal with this. is this normal in the restaurant industry? very rude managers? i feel i won’t stay there very long. i’ll update as time goes on, we’ll see if i even show up for the next shift. life is far too short to deal with meanies like this. i live in a big city, im sure there’s another opportunity for me somewhere. but here? not for me.. we’ll see.

## Bose QuietComfort 20 in 2025: A Detailed​ Review

Let's assess the ⁤ *Bose QuietComfort 20 acoustic noise ⁢cancelling‍ headphones* in the context of 2025,considering advancements in technology ⁤and evolving user needs.

**Noise Cancellation:** The QC20’s *active noise cancelling headphones* were excellent for⁣ their time,⁤ and⁤ still ‍perform well. The depth⁤ of noise reduction ​is still notable. However, newer ⁣headphones, particularly those with advanced digital signal processing, offer even⁤ more refined cancellation, often targeting specific ‌frequency ranges more effectively. Considering *ANC headphones*,⁢ the QC20 holds its own, but isn't the leader anymore.

**Sound Quality:** While​ subjective, most⁢ reviews praise the QC20's balanced sound signature, making them ⁢suitable for various genres. The *bose ⁣quietcomfort 20 sound quality* is still considered⁤ very good, ​even though perhaps a little ‌less detailed compared to some newer audiophile-focused options.‌ Enthusiasts may find alternatives​ providing a wider sound stage and crisper detail,but for many,the QC20s offer a pleasant and versatile listening experience.

**Comfort and Fit:** The ear tips are designed for comfort, and most users find them suitable for extended ⁣listening sessions. Though, fit is⁣ always⁢ personal, and some may prefer other designs.

**Features and Functionality:** The ""Aware Mode"" remains a useful‌ feature for situational awareness. Though, the QC20⁤ lacks modern ⁢features such as Bluetooth connectivity, customizable ‍EQ settings, and advanced voice assistant integration, all common in ​newer *bose headphones* and competing models. It is a wired ⁤ *wired⁤ noise cancelling headphones* model.

**Durability and Reliability:** The *QuietComfort headphones* line is generally ​known for its build quality,but ⁣the QC20 is showing its age. The cables are a potential point of failure, ⁢and ⁣users may need to source *bose quietcomfort 20 replacement parts* ‍ or ⁤ *bose quietcomfort 20 repair* services ⁢over time.

**Price⁢ and Availability:** Given their‌ age, finding new *Bose QuietComfort 20 acoustic noise cancelling headphones* can be challenging. They​ are often available ‌on the *bose⁢ qc20 sale* market sold *used bose quietcomfort 20* ‍or *refurbished bose qc20* options.

## Alternatives to the Bose QuietComfort⁤ 20: What Are Your Options in 2025?

If *where ⁢to buy bose qc20* ⁢ is becoming increasingly difficult,⁤ or if you're looking for something more modern ⁣with enhanced features, here are some⁣ alternatives to consider, categorized by user need:

**For the Business Traveler:**

   **Sony WH-1000XM5:** Considered ⁤by many to be the current gold standard in noise cancellation, offering exceptional performance⁤ and features​ like speak-to-chat and ‍multipoint connectivity.
   **Bose QuietComfort Headphones (Over-Ear):** The over-ear version of the quietcomfort line provides stellar noise cancellation​ and‌ a comfortable design for long flights.

**For the Student:**

*   **Anker Soundcore Life Q30:** Delivers excellent noise cancellation and sound quality⁢ at a very affordable‍ price point.⁣ A strong for *affordable noise cancelling headphones.
   **JBL Tune 760NC:** Another budget-friendly option with​ decent noise cancellation⁤ and a comfortable over-ear design.

**For the Commuter:**

*   **Technics‌ EAH-AZ80:** these‍ earbuds boast excellent noise cancellation, ⁢a comfortable​ fit, and long battery life, making them ideal for daily commutes.*   **OnePlus Buds 3 :** Great value, effective ​noise‍ cancelling, ⁣and compact ‍charging case

**For the Audio ⁤Enthusiast on ⁣a Budget:**

   **Earfun Free Pro 3:** These earbuds⁢ offer surprisingly good noise cancellation and​ sound quality for their price, making them a ⁢great budget-friendly option.
Used QC20 or refurbished Bose earbuds (consider conditions)

## Conclusion: the QC20's Legacy and Future

The *Bose QuietComfort 20* undeniably left a lasting mark on the world of *noise cancelling earbuds* and *headphones⁤ with ‍noise cancellation*. They pushed⁢ the boundaries of noise ⁣cancellation in a portable format and set a ⁤benchmark for future generations.

However, technology has advanced significantly since their initial release. While the QC20 still offers competent noise cancellation and decent​ sound quality, their age and lack ⁤of modern features make them less competitive⁤ against newer ​models.

For those seeking a reliable and affordable noise cancelling solution, particularly if found at a meaningful *bose quietcomfort 20 discount*, a *used bose quietcomfort 20*, or *refurbished bose qc20*, the QC20 may still be a viable option.

Ultimately, the best​ choice depends on individual needs and preferences. weighing the features, performance, and price of the *Bose QuietComfort 20* against modern alternatives will help you determine if these iconic ​headphones still hold ‍their own in the evolving world of audio technology in 2025. If you have considered⁣ the *bose quietcomfort 20 price* and ‍features, there may be modern alternatives that may be more⁣ suited⁤ to your needs. Remember to⁤ seek out real user reviews to help‌ with the decision making process.

1jsk6b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n/comments/1jsk6b5/need_help_building_this_willing_to_pay/,Need help building this. Willing to pay.,"Hey Reddit,

I’m working on a project where I’m building a **highly realistic Twitter bot network** using **n8n**, **Puppeteer**, and **GPT** — all running locally on a dedicated laptop.

Speed doesn’t matter — I’m prioritizing realism, variability, and stealth.

Here’s what I’m aiming to build and what I could use help with.

# The Core Idea

I want to control **50–100 Twitter accounts**, each acting like a real person.

Each bot will:

* Log in individually (no Twitter API — browser-based only using Puppeteer)
* Scroll through their feed
* Like posts
* Occasionally retweet or follow accounts
* Post their own tweets randomly (including text + image tweets)
* Stay logged in for a random amount of time (between 1–10 minutes)
* Log out and rotate to the next account

This bot loop runs **from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. every day**, simulating sleep during off hours.

# Manual Tweet Trigger (Main Account)

Whenever I manually tweet something from my **main account**, I’ll trigger a webhook in n8n.

That webhook will:

* Store the tweet text + link
* Initiate an **engagement wave** from a random group of bots that will:
   * Mostly **like** the tweet
   * Some **retweet** it
   * A few **reply or quote tweet** it

Replies will be generated **contextually via GPT** using the actual tweet content.

# Reply Workflow

When replying to the main account:

1. The bot reads the tweet text.
2. GPT generates a reply based on the tweet **and the bot’s personality**.
3. The bot posts the reply via Puppeteer (browser control).

# Image Tweeting System

Some bots will also post their own original tweets with photos.

The system will:

1. Grab a random image from a local folder
2. Use GPT to describe the image
3. Re-prompt GPT to write a caption for the photo
4. Tweet the image + caption
5. Delete the image from the folder after use to prevent duplication

# Anti-Detection Measures

* Bots reuse **saved login cookies** to avoid repeated logins and security prompts
* Using **stealth plugins** and headless Chromium fingerprint spoofing (user-agent, timezone, screen size, etc.)
* Each bot uses a **dedicated proxy/static IP** to avoid shared-VPN detection
* Bots engage in **non-main account activity** as well (liking trending posts, following accounts, replying to niche tweets)

# Advanced Features I’m Implementing

Here’s where the fun really starts — I’m layering in complexity to make these bots more believable:

# 1. Bot Personalities

Each bot has its own:

* Tone (playful, chill, sarcastic, poetic)
* Interests (dogs, coffee, tech, memes, food, etc.)
* Emoji usage level
* Reply style (casual, dramatic, minimalist)
* Fake timezone (used to limit “awake” hours)

Personalities will guide GPT responses and behavior patterns.

# 2. Bot-to-Bot Engagement

Bots will:

* Follow each other
* Occasionally reply to or quote tweet each other
* Build micro “communities” to simulate real friend groups or followers

# 3. Cooldowns and Suspicion Limits

Each bot will:

* Track its last like / RT / reply time
* Follow cooldown logic so it doesn’t over-engage
* Get temporarily paused if flagged or if an error occurs (e.g., CAPTCHA)

# 4. Fake Timezone Schedules

Each bot has its own fake timezone (e.g., GMT+2, GMT-5)

It only runs sessions when it’s “awake” in its timezone

Adds realism and naturally staggers engagement waves

# 5. Post-Like Decay Logic

Bots will:

* Prioritize liking tweets within the first 2 hours after they're posted
* Scale down likes/replies/RTs after 12–24h

This makes main account tweet engagement look more organic

# 6. Internal Dashboard (n8n-powered)

I’ll be tracking:

* Which bots are active or on cooldown
* What tweets each bot engaged with
* Error logs (e.g., login failures, blocked actions)
* Manual override controls (to force engagement mode, pause accounts, etc.)

# 7. Event-Based Surges

Bots will temporarily increase engagement based on:

* Keywords in tweets (e.g., “giveaway”, “drop”, “launch”)
* Specific time triggers (e.g., Friday night, product drop window)

# What I Could Use Help With

If you’ve ever worked with Puppeteer, n8n, GPT, or any sort of stealth automation — I’d love your input on:

* How to structure workflows cleanly (centralized or per-bot?)
* How to manage Puppeteer cookies per bot inside n8n
* Assigning unique proxies per bot in a scalable way
* Best practices for image deletion + storage
* Any known quirks with Puppeteer + Twitter that I should plan around

Essential Techniques and Tips for Crafting Your Own Custom Tables
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Crafting custom tables can be an enjoyable woodworking venture that adds a personal touch to your space. With the right tools, materials, and techniques, you can create stunning pieces of furniture that not only serve a purpose but also showcase your skills. Here are some essential techniques and tips to kick-start your journey.

### Understanding the Basics of Table Design

Before diving into the actual building process, it's important to understand the basic design concepts. Each table can be categorized based on its use—dining tables, coffee tables, or desks—each requiring different dimensions and styles. Follow these initial steps:

Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
- **Determine the Size:** Measure the space where the table will go. Ensure there’s enough room around it for chairs or movement.
- **Choose the Style:** Decide on the aesthetic you want—modern, rustic, or traditional. This will guide your choice of materials and design.
- **Sketch Your Ideas:** Draw rough diagrams to visualize your design. This will help in understanding proportions and layout.

### Materials Required for Table Crafting

Choosing the right materials is key to successful table crafting. Here’s a list of common materials you might consider:

- **Wood:** Hardwood like oak or maple is often preferred for durability, while pine is a great choice if you’re looking for a more affordable option.
- **Metal:** For a modern look, metal legs or accents can enhance the design.
- **Finishes:** Stains, paints, or sealants can protect and beautify your table.

### Essential Tools You'll Need

To bring your table design to life, it’s essential to have the right tools. Here’s a list of must-have equipment:

Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
- **Measuring Tape:** Ensure accurate measurements for all pieces.
- **Saw:** A table saw or circular saw will help in cutting your wood to size.
- **Drill:** Use it for making holes for screws and dowels.
- **Sander:** To smooth surfaces and edges, achieving a polished finish.
- **Clamps:** To hold pieces together while the glue dries.

### Step-by-Step Crafting Techniques

Now, let’s get into the crafting process. Here’s a simplified step-by-step guide to help you create your custom table:

#### 1. Cutting the Wood

Using your saw, cut the top, legs, and any support beams according to your sketch. Measure twice before cutting to avoid mistakes.

#### 2. Assembling the Base

Start by assembling the legs, ensuring they are secure. Use wood glue and screws for strength.

#### 3. Attaching the Tabletop

Once the base is complete, position the tabletop and attach it using screws. Don’t forget to double-check alignment!

#### 4. Sanding and Finishing

Spend extra time sanding, as this will make a huge difference in the final look. Be sure to apply your chosen finish evenly for a smooth appearance.

### Adding Personal Touches

To make your table truly unique, consider adding personal touches. Here are some ideas:

- **Carvings:** If you are skilled in wood carving, adding designs or patterns can enhance aesthetics.
- **Inlays:** Introducing materials like resin or different woods can add character to your design.
- **Different Finishes:** Experiment with distressing techniques for a rustic look, or a high-gloss finish for a modern touch.

### Safety Measures to Keep in Mind

Woodworking can present certain risks, so your safety should always be a priority. Here are some essential precautions:

- **Wear Eye Protection:** Always wear safety goggles when working with power tools.
- **Work in a Well-Ventilated Area:** This is especially important when using finishes or glues.
- **Keep Your Workspace Clean:** A tidy area minimizes the risk of accidents.

By following these techniques and tips, you’ll be well on your way to crafting your own custom tables. Remember that practice makes perfect, so don’t hesitate to experiment and let your creativity shine!

My reason for wanting the role is that I know I could do the job very well without being stressed, it was only 30 hours/week, pay is good for the remote area I work in, location was nearby, hybrid was offered. If I had landed the job, my plan was to stay with the company for at least 5 years.

During the initial interview they pointed out the more menial aspects of the job - making coffee, tidying up lunchroom, stocking employee snacks, making runs to post office, picking up catering, etc. I said I was good with doing all of that.

I get asked to come in for a 2nd interview scheduled for 2 hours 30 minutes. As part of it, I’m asked to do a 30 minute PowerPoint showcasing my presentation & technical skills. There’s also a 30 minute Excel test. This seemed to not be in line with the way they described the bulk of the job, so I think there must be more to it and really put a lot of effort into the presentation which I was told was great. Shortly afterwards they bring up the more menial job aspects again to double check that I’m okay with them.

I did not get the job and was given no feedback. I felt like I would have had a better chance if I had presented myself as more basic and not discussed my more significant achievements. I found it confusing that on the one hand they were implying the job is not that technical, but on the other hands have this intense interview process.

Figured this would be the perfect place to ask!

I've been a Nespresso pod person for quite some time now, however, not only do I feel like I'm wasting a ton of money on 7.77ml pods / I'm also making like 3 to 4 of these pods per day (also, the lack of flavored choices for the Vertuo leaves alot to be desired).

That's when I started looking up coffee machines. I would not consider myself a coffee-expert/snob/connoisseur/what have you. I can go to Dunkin' and be happy... my coffee usually has a few splenda and a boat load of creamer.

I love the look of the Moccamaster KGBV Select and have read that it's a quality product - justifying the price tag. **However, is the Moccamaster overkill for me (Mr. Splenda)?** I don't plan on grinding beans - I'd be ordering pre-ground Bones Coffee Co. (such interesting flavors).

In essence, by using pre-ground coffee and dumping a bunch of splenda and cream into my coffee - would :

A) The moccamaster be able to use pre-ground coffee (bones coffee co)?  
B) Would I notice the difference from a cheaper machine?

Let me know what ya think...

1jsjs5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTpGentleman/comments/1jsjs5p/tpg_episode_review_coach_makes_jimmy_an_offer_he/,TPG Episode Review - Coach Makes Jimmy an Offer He Can't Refuse!!,"This is a pivotal episode in TPG lore as it is the official ""fake"" agreement for Jimmy to become partner in Coach's ponzi. 

6:18 Coach commends Jimmy on working for free. Jimmy responds by saying ""you gotta see the process before you jump in."" Very eerie.

7:20 Coach reveals he offered Jimmy a full time job as an Operations Manager with a generous salary. Jimmy, sticking to the script and illusion of said salary, reiterates that the salary is ""very generous."" 

9:40 Coach asks Jimmy what it would take, money wise, for him to jump ship from being a teller to working full time for TPG. 

Jimmy responds with a muted answer. We're gonna need a Jomboy lip read for this one fellas. Wouldn't be surprised if he didn't say anything at all as this is possibly scripted. Both Jimmy and coach have their hands placed strategically when the number is stated. 

10:03 Coach asks what number Jimmy can survive on if he guaranteed him a certain amount of money. Jimmy responds with what I assume is ""a hundred""

10:30 Coach for some reason offers Jimmy 30% equity in all future business ventures because he is delusional and probably on drugs.

Does Coach cap all of his businesses at an imaginary number in his head? If he really wanted his business to grow how could he give a bank teller 30% stake in all of his fake businesses? When his massage clients, SORRY, silent investors find this out why would they bother investing? 

Why doesn't Jimmy, a supposed business genius, not see the stupidity in such a proposal and school Coach on this? 

11:50 Coach tells Jimmy he made a promise to himself to go all in and fall back on a regular line of work if it doesn't work out. By regular work he means tuggin'

13:00 coach tells Jimmy he will only pay him salary for one year if he decides to join. He takes a 5 second pause after this and tells Jimmy that after that it will only be ""pure equity""

Jimmy repeats that term and looks off into the distance as if it is a good idea (it is a terrible idea).

13:22 Coach tells Jimmy in the next year he wants to open the following:

1) a tattoo parlour 2) sushi restaurant 3) coffee shop

Jimmy makes a sour face and looks impressed. 

Jimmy tells Coach he doesn't mind stepping away from the corporate lifestyle he never lived and will need to wait until his ""fat bonuses"" hit his account.

If Jimmy were a big shot in the corporate world, he’d have to return that “fat bonus” if he left the firm within a certain period after receiving it.


All in all, I can conclude this is essential TPG viewing. Jimmy had many chances within this episode to show he was truly business savvy but he just sits there making weird faces.
