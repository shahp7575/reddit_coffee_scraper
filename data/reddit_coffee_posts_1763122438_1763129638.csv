1owxif6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1owxif6/two_way_abuse_am_i_wrong_what_should_i_do/,Two way abuse am I wrong what should I do?,"I 32M her 30F, with a Toddler child living in NC married 8 years. I’m active duty military which IMO complicates things and she is a stay at home mother. It started slow and honestly I can’t even remember the first incident, the most recent was this morning. If it wasn’t for our child I would leave immediately and sleep in my truck bed (I have before) rather than stay in the home. 

I will start that I am aware that I’m an emotionally abusive husband and am an anxious avoidant personality type outside of this I honestly don’t understand what I do that is so abusive to her which she states causes her to reactively abuse me. For me when we have disagreements I prefer to just walk away and be done with it and hope that after some time we can come together and talk about the issue with a clearer head. She is a self diagnosed Autistic/adhd woman with PTSD and severe anxiety (diagnosed) and is a very physically abusive partner. She punches, scratches, spits, bites, screams, threatens to kill herself, me, and our child (she has never harmed our child). She has destroyed thousands of dollars of my personal property. Cut nearly all of my clothes into pieces, destroyed a Xbox, thrown my cell phone out of the second story window onto the concrete. Destroyed books of mine, watches, deleted all of my photos from my phone and iCloud including many of my son when he was an infant that were only on my device. Also many of those photos of were many years and memories of my military service all which are gone now and I believe I can’t get them back. She destroyed her wedding ring and all jewelry I had gotten for her ever. She has pours coffee and soda on our $3k couch which is a few years old now. This is just what has happened recently and what I can remember. 

Some times she will just pick a day and be like I’m not going to watch our child you need to figure it out which obviously I can’t bc I’m in the military and can’t just take my son with me to work. This has gotten my work them due to me calling saying that I need a few hours before I can show up to arrange child care. 

I have no family. Her family is 5 hours drive away and are very helpful and understanding but she dislikes them and doesn’t want to help or talk to them. Two of her siblings no longer have any contact with her. 

I want to divorce but I don’t understand how people financially afford it in this state. They require a 12 month “separation period” where you can’t live together. The military doesn’t accept this so I am still obligated to care for her finically as far as I know. Basically I have to pay for or current home and go get my own apartment for a year. I’m worried that once I do this she is going to up and leave to go to her parents and now I’m on the hook for two leases. Current home expires in April. 

I know I should leave but I worry about her and our child. She is under the impression that she can’t work due to her issues stated above and idk how she would be able to support herself and our son even with child support. Then the issue that I would not see my child but every few weeks kills me being from a home where I had no father. 

I’m just so lost and it seems like the fights and blow ups are getting closer and closer in interval. It’s nearly every day now and I live in a constant state of fear that my next word is going to light the fuse to the next blow up. It to the point where I pause and rehearse what I’m going to say when I feel her getting into that state of mind before she gets angry.

I have tired therapy but in the military system it takes a long time to be seen, and then when I do I feel like I get the common therapy talk which doesn’t help me. 

I take a SSRI and anxiety medication currently which helps but I feel like it makes me more willing to accept things that have gotten me into this situation that I’m in. 

Any advice is appreciated, sorry for the length. ",1,1763129467.0,domesticviolence,0,1.0,False

1owxi4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1owxi4n/which_smart_plugs_are_best_for_small_apartments/,Which smart plugs are best for small apartments?,"Look, I've been living in a cramped studio for the past two years, and let me tell you - space is everything when you're working with 400 square feet. That's why I got obsessed with smart plugs. They've honestly changed how I use my tiny apartment.

**Why Smart Plugs Work Great in Small Spaces**

The thing about small apartments is you can't really do major renovations or mess with the electrical system. Smart plugs are perfect because you just stick them in your existing outlets and boom - you've got control over everything without calling an electrician or losing your security deposit.

I use mine for my coffee maker, floor lamp, fan, and even my phone charger. Being able to turn stuff off from bed or set schedules means I'm not stumbling around in the dark or wasting electricity when I'm at work.

**What Makes a Good Smart Plug for Apartments**

Here's what actually matters when you're choosing smart plugs for a smaller living space:

**Size** - Some smart plugs are bulky and block both outlets. That's a dealbreaker when you only have like 6 outlets total. Look for compact designs or ones with side-by-side plugs.

**Setup** - You want something that connects to your WiFi quickly. I don't have patience for apps that crash or require seventeen steps to pair a device.

**Voice Control** - If you've got Alexa or Google Home, make sure your smart plugs work with them. It's genuinely useful when your hands are full or you're cooking.

**Energy Monitoring** - This feature shows you which devices are electricity vampires. I found out my old TV was using power even when ""off"" and costing me extra every month.

**My Top Picks**

After trying different brands, I've found that the best options usually have good reviews, easy setup, and don't cost a fortune. You can check out a solid selection of [smart plugs here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) that work well for apartment living.

The mini versions are my favorite because they don't hog outlet space. I've also had good luck with the ones that have multiple plugs built into one unit - super helpful when you're outlet-poor like most of us in apartments.

**Real Benefits I've Noticed**

My electric bill went down about $15 a month just from scheduling things better and catching phantom power drains. That might not sound like much, but it adds up.

I also feel safer leaving the apartment. I can check if I left my straightener on and turn it off from my phone. No more anxiety at work wondering if I'm about to burn the building down.

The automation stuff is pretty sweet too. My lamp turns on at sunset automatically, so I never come home to a dark apartment anymore. Small thing, but it makes a difference.

**Getting Started**

Honestly, you don't need to plug everything in at once. Start with one or two smart plugs for the devices you use most. See how you like them. I started with just my coffee maker and kept adding more as I saw how useful they were.

If you want to browse different options and find what fits your space best, I'd recommend [checking out this selection](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs). Read the reviews, compare features, and pick what makes sense for your apartment setup.

Smart plugs aren't going to magically make your apartment bigger, but they'll definitely make living in a small space easier and more efficient. Plus, when you eventually move to a bigger place, you just unplug them and take them with you.",1,1763129447.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False
1owxhmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1owxhmq/parents/,Parents,"My parents came to visit me and my husband for the first time ever, we recently moved to another contienct away from the UK. My father has always been a strange and unpredictable person, but I tried to put that aside and still invited him and my mother to stay with us.  
When we were kids, he used to scream at us, insult us, and sometimes be emotionally abusive. I’ve always believed he might have some sort of bipolar disorder, although he’s never been diagnosed.  
Few days ago, he woke up in morning and had coffee with me and my mum. After a while, he suddenly got mad at her because in a picture she took of him, there was a bag visible he said it made him look homeless.  
Later, I took them on a walk. My mum asked me to take a picture of them together but he refused to be in the photo, started walking about 30 steps ahead of us and completely stopped talking to us. We sat on a bench for a while, and then he disappeared for about 20 minutes. When he came back, he stood about 20 steps away from us and still wouldn’t speak or come near. We decided to leave and looked around for him, but we couldn’t find him.  
We eventually left the place as we were under the impression that he knows how to come back. He did not have his phone, watch, or any money with him.  
Bare in mind, this behavours it is not new and he used to do this to us when we were kids - he would not walk with my mum, myself and sister, he would walk in front of us and acts like he doesnt know us. All because he will get mad over something stupiud.  
Anyways, after few hours my husband and I went looking for him and couldn’t find him anywhere.  
We were always walking on eggshells when we were kids depending on whether he was in a “good” or “bad” mood. I still remember once, in the middle of winter, he got furious because my mum accidentally hit a curb with the car he bought her. He started hitting her, I screamed at him, and he got so angry that he walked off for over an hour in freezing weather. When he came back, he didn’t speak to us for days.  
After being gone for hours, we received a phone call from a random person who said my dad had approached her because they spoke a similar language and he told her he was lost. My husband and I went to pick him up. The lady told us he had said he was lost, but when he got in the car, he didn’t say a single word to us. He walked straight into the house, went to his room, and later texted my sister saying he wants to return home as soon as possible And that myself and my mum left him behind.

He came out of the guest room and said I should been ashamed of myself etc and this is where I lost my cool. I started losing my sh\*\* and told him everything.  
I spent a lot of money on their trip, and this is the behaviour I get in return.  
I asked my mum to stay with us and he can return alone since he wants to go back, but instead she told me she has nothing to do here and she is going with him. I ended up changiing their flights at 10pm for a 7am morning.  
I told her we will call them an uber in the morning that it will take them to the airport. Neither of them said anything to me and my husband before they went to bed.  
They woke up at 3am in the morning and my husband got up, my father left to do at the ground floor and my mum stayed behind to finish packing. My husband went with my mum in the hall to call the lift for her and told her which car to get in etc. She just said bye to him and that was it.

A day later once they makde it back home, I recive a messge from my mother saying i am no longer their daughter, they had enoufg from me and they never want to see me again, or to call them. I should forget that I have parents.

I thought that as he and her got older, they might realise things and change but it doesn’t seem to be the case.  
AITAH for changing their flights or should have let him do what he wants in my home? and still treat me like a crap?  
I have also blocked them on everywhere and asked them to send me the money back for theuir flights as I spent around £1500 on their flights.

I know this is extrmele toxic, and I should of never invited them in my home. At the same time, I realised they will never change and my mother will always be his puppy and defend him no matter what.",1,1763129413.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False
1owxh6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/StraightTransGirls/comments/1owxh6l/how_to_deal_with_unwanted_attention/,how to deal with unwanted attention,"Anyone else has this problem? It goes, typically, like this:

I get to my favourite supermarket, one of the men working there gets really into me and I just can't have a single time going there without him always slipping in as a cashier or always being very stare-down when I go there. Sometimes they confront me to get me to talk to them or they just happen to walk very close to me to say hi and force a talk. It happens at coffee places, at supermarkets (this is the third supermarket I now have to avoid in my neighbourhood) or parks, public spaces, even sometimes subway stations I need to go to, bus stops. Sometimes it's almost stalkerish (I had a proper one many years ago) but most often it's the same men at the same places always being there, always when I'm there and trying to force a talk, contact, anything really. Basically pushy men everywhere.

It's easier saying 'no thank you' in public spaces but with businesses I have to go to, or that are important for everyday nescessities, it's not that easy and it feels like I really have to push through to not tell them to fuck off and risk leaving burning earth. It leads to avoidant behaviour on my part cause it's just too much on most days. It's like a daily struggle and fight. 

Is the solution to just be very bland and dismissive when anyone wants to start a talk? I most often just can't help but be friendly, it's simply my kind of thing, and smiling back and whatever - but it feels like I make a easier victim for these kind of men. I also did therapy and was told I just have that look and I look approachable, which makes me a easier target. I'm usually not a black or white thinking human bean but it feels like it's better to just go through life like a linebacker, for safeties sake. Problem is, I tried that many times but I just can't force something that is not my personality. I live in a big city btw.

Perhaps my willingness to acknowledge the reality that inflation on is up 27% since 2019 and it’s not Toyota specifically suddenly raising prices on a whim plays a role? 

Maybe it’s that I bought a minivan understanding it’s a minivan and not a luxury vehicle? 

Or maybe I just have low expectations of a 4500lb 7 passenger vehicle that gets 35mpg and I expect to last 20 years and 300k miles?

1owxfet,https://v.redd.it/pi8uu1j4c81g1,Juicy - A battery app that actually makes you grab your charger,"Hey all,

I'd like to share my first ever app I've been working on over the past few weeks - Juicy.

I wanted an app to lets you set battery alerts at whatever percentage you want. 20%, 15%, 3%, hell even 1% if you like to live on the edge.

Each alert has this nice glow effect and a custom sound - vibrant enough that you'll actually notice and go grab your cable.

The alerts themselves are these little notification pills that bounce onto your screen. Way nicer to look at than the default system ones.

You also get a clean compact battery icon in your menu bar with the percentage inside, battery health info, cycle count, temperature monitoring, and time remaining so you're not just guessing when your Mac's about to die.

I built it because I work a lot from coffee shops and love to squeeze the last juice (no pun intended) out of my Macbook battery. 

However, I hate when it just suddenly dies so now I have an alert at 15%, 5%, 3% and 1% and I tell you. Once I see the 1% notification I do actually run to grab my charger haha!

You can not only use it for low battery alerts but also the opposite. Like I have an 80% alert so I know when to unplug and keep my battery healthy long-term. I'm aware there's some apps that do this specifically but Juicy has it built-in and is a lightweight alternative I guess.

It's fully built natively in Swift. Uses basically no CPU. Just does its thing quietly in the background.

Would love to hear what you think. It has a free trial so give it a try if you are interested.

1owxdji,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1owxdji/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1owxatx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1owxatx/coffee_bean_tracking_app_brewly/,Coffee Bean Tracking App - Brewly,"Hey everyone, I built a small side project called Brewly because I wanted an easy, visual way to log and rate the coffee beans I try. Just posting here to see if anyone is interested in playing around with the app.

Initially it wasn't mean to be anything commercial, just something for people who like tracking what they’re drinking. I'm not a software engineer but I love to tinker and honestly spent *way* too much time figuring out how to get the keyboard to push up the input fields so they don't overlap 😅

There were some cool solutions out there, but I really started getting into coffee bag art/designs and also wanted to ensuring I was showcasing some of the cool roasters I found. Current functionality includes:

1. **Log** \- this is where you can log a new bag of beans or a cup of coffee (from your beans or elsewhere). I ultimately worked on the ability to log beans, but realized we should add cup functionality as well, although I don't really find that as exciting to log each cup you have, but who knows! There's some basic AI scanning where you can take a photo of the beans and it tries to extract details. You can choose to log all your beans and rate them later, or log and rate at the same time. I also preloaded about 2K roasters and am working on getting descriptions and photos for everything --- after all, I wanted this to look aesthetically pleasing!
2. **Feed** \- Think of this like the legacy Venmo feed. Really just shows all activity that's happening in the app. People logging/rating new beans or cups. There's a follower section where you can see what's happening with your friends or people you follow. You can like and comment on feed entries.
3. **Discover** \- The last module I created when I realized there really should be more of a discovery option. This is meant to allow you to see the top rated roasters from the community and the beans. There's also a top cups section here as well. Again, I didn't spend a ton of time on this because I just assumed it wouldn't be used as much. It also allows you to search for any of the roasters in our database. I am constantly adding new ones!
4. **Library** \- This is where all your logged beans and cups live. You have a record of all your logged beans and cups. You can change your ratings or edit the details. You also can indicate if the beans are in-stock or not.

That's basically it. Again, if there's interest to play around, I'd be happy to listen to your feedback and see how I can incorporate.

1owxasc,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1owxasc/tifu_by_accidentally_sending_a_message_to_a/,TIFU by accidentally sending a message to a company email complaining about the company,"So, this really happened today. I was feeling pretty frustrated with work and thought it would help to vent in an email to what I assumed was just my close coworker. I poured out everything: long rants about management, the bizarre schedule, the broken coffee machine—basically a whole novel of complaints. Satisfied with my work, I hit “send”… only to realize I had accidentally clicked “Reply All.”

Within moments, emails started flooding in. HR. My boss. Even the CEO. Some responses were polite, but most definitely were not. I spent the rest of the day apologizing, deleting drafts, and trying to act like I was invisible. My coworkers kept sending me their reactions, some laughing, others giving me judgmental comments. I now completely get the meaning of “instant regret.”

The bright side? At least my rants were somewhat amusing, so half the office got a good laugh at my expense. But honestly, I’m just counting down the days until this all blows over… if it ever does.

TL;DR: Tried to vent to a coworker, accidentally emailed the entire company. Embarrassment: off the charts.

Pretty sure it’s the 49mm group head version. 

Aside from cosmetics, which is mostly just cleaning, polishing, and descaling, what would you recommend purchasing? 

Already have a decent grinder (Niche Zero), now I’d love to hear how and from where did you upgrade your La Pavoni. 

Here’s my current list of upgrade options, I’d be happy if any of you would give recommendations to where and what to purchase from the list and add/subtract to it:
[I like buying budget friendly products so I can always switch them up]. 

- Bottomless Portafilter 
- Tamper 
- DWT Tool
- Single + Double Precision Baskets 
- Puck Screen 
- Single nozzle Steamer 
- Coffee funnel 

[Maintenance products:
- Rubber Gaskets 
- Chrome/Rust cleaners
- Chrome Drip Tray
- Anything you like about your coffee station; Bin, Tamping station, Rubber mats, etc.

On the Hill: This is one of the changes that President Trump would like to see made to Obamacare. Separately, the newly signed federal funding package will outlaw hemp THC products.

Next stop, Mars: Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin (BORGN) launched NASA's landmark Mars mission with its New Glenn rocket, and successfully recovered its booster for the first time.

Easing prices
The Trump administration plans to remove tariffs on certain goods from four Latin American countries that are not produced in the U.S. The planned tariff relief aims to address high food prices and reduce grocery bills for consumers at home.

The details: The White House announced agreements with Ecuador, Argentina, Guatemala and El Salvador to deepen bilateral trade and investment. The four countries agreed to address a range of non-tariff barriers for U.S. goods and businesses. Notably, Argentina opened its market to live cattle from the U.S. and committed to allow market access for U.S. poultry within a year. ""The deals will help U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen, small businesses, and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports to and expand business opportunities with these trading partners,"" the White House declared.

In return, bananas, coffee, beef, cocoa, and certain textile products imported from these countries will be exempt from tariffs, a senior U.S. official told reporters. U.S. tariff rates on other imports from these nations remain the same - 15% for Ecuador; and 10% for Argentina, Guatemala and El Salvador. The deals are expected to be signed within roughly two weeks. The White House expects U.S. retailers and wholesalers to pass on any benefits to American consumers.

Bigger picture: ""Heightened political concerns about U.S. consumers' inflation perceptions seem to be leading a drive to reduce the tariffs U.S. importers pay on food products,"" said Paul Donovan, UBS' chief economist. ""U.S. consumers' belief that they pay for tariffs is likely to be reinforced by this stance."" According to CPI data, banana prices rose about 8% on average from January to September, while coffee got 15% more expensive. U.S. beef prices hit record levels due to long-term droughts, high feed costs, smaller herds, and strong beef demand. (3 comments)

- 0.5 oz cream liqueur 
- 0.5 oz vodka
- 0.25 oz simple syrup
- 1 oz fresh espresso 
- blueberries

How to:

In a shaker tin, muddle a single large blueberry or two small ones, add ingredients, wet shake with ice, then dry shake (found this to be the best way to aerate the espresso and get a nice foam), double strain into your martini/coup glass (dealer's choice).

I know this sounds pathetic. I tell myself I’m over it, but I can’t shake her shadow.

Sometimes I think I’ll wake up one day and the obsession will be gone. Other days, I feel like I’m stuck in a loop, reliving every argument, every kiss, every “I love you” that I’ll never hear again.

We've stayed at multiple ryokans over the years and this one is by far the worst. In fact, I wouldn't stay there for free.

The whole experience is rushed. While other ryokans provide a serene, relaxing experience. Here you're stressed out of your mind. 

Staff likes to look at you while you eat breakfast and dinner, impatiently. The dinner, oh my god, was barely convencience store level (yes, I'm aware convencience store food is decent). Served in 30-45mins, while the staff looks at you if you want, try to, enjoy it. The food is bland and the tempura is, just sad. One dish was a hotpot, not with beef or seafood. No, just a few good old pork slices. They do not serve tea, unless you ask for it. Dinner is served under TL lights with close proximity between guests, destroying any possibility of a decent atmosphere. While we were there, there were ZERO Japanese guests. Contrary to all our other ryokan stays. I wonder why. 

Breakfast was slightly better than dinner, but that is one low hurdle. They serve...salad as a dish. While we were trying to scavenge whatever was left of our stay, the staff will ask whether you're finished with breakfast 25mins in, so they can provide you a nice cup of coffee served with infinite amount of impatient stares. I've never felt so unwelcome in our various stays in Japan. That includes years back when the teenage me was staying in hostels. 

The public bath is barely the size of three toilets. The building is old and run down. This a ryokan, the same way that technically Mcnugget is made of chicken.

Oh and the checkout. It's technically at 10.00, but the staff will be waiting at your door starting around 9.30. Just utterly amazing. This is a money making machine. 

Everything is just wrong. Yet it has a 9/10 on Booking. With all resprect, that is due to first time tourists. If you want to try a real ryokan, spend the time to visit the one at Lake Biwa. It will blow your mind.",8,1763127702.0,JapanTravelTips,2,0.79,False

**1999**

Sandra only lived fleeting moments of the next day on set. Most of the time, Sunny Sandy stood in for her. Sandra’s soul threatened to break under the tension between her mourning and her determination. Sandy didn’t have to feel anything. She only had to sing and smile.

After a lunch she didn’t remember eating, Sandra realized that surrendering to Sandy was easy. Looking back, she had been doing it her entire life. Every time her mother pinched her for whispering questions during church. Every time a teacher called her stupid. Every time a boy touched her without asking. Sandy was there. Sandy was who she was always meant to be. She was the one the world wanted.

When Dory called for the final scene of the day, Sandy was ready. She sat on her plain wooden stool in front of the green field on the backdrop. It was a country scene painted masterfully by artists who had never been to the country. It was unreal in its perfection. It was made for Sunny Sandy.

At Dory’s reluctant cue, the child actors took their places around her. He had been dreading the children all day. They arced around Sandy like the giant wooden rainbow arced over them all. It was colored with precise, unblemished curves showing every color of the rainbow in a strident technicolor hue. In the middle of its bend, the rainbow had large googly eyes and a small smile with dimples at the ends. It was Granny Rainbow, the character Sandra had created in honor of her Granny Ruth. Now, Sandy, Granny Rainbow, and these children were going to sing the last song of the show’s first season: a reprise of “Put On a Smiling Face.”

“Is Mrs. Nell ready?” Dory called to Caroline.

“Yes sir!” Then into her walkie, “Mrs. Nell to set, please.”

Nonaree Nell glowed as she walked into the sound stage. She was the network’s first country star, and Sandra had watched her with Mama on Sunday nights. Part comedian, part puppeteer, part singer, Nonaree was the woman that had made Sandra want to be on TV. If Nonaree could make it all the way from Cobbler’s Corners, Sandra could make it from Dove Hill.

Standing feet away from Nonaree Nell, Sandra would have made a fool of herself. She would have spoken first or, worse, said she admired Nonaree. Sandy was better than such unprofessional nonsense. This was a job—her job—and she was damn good at it. While Sandra wondered what Mama would say if she could see Nonaree Nell playing the rainbow tribute to her mother, Sandy waited for Dory’s cue.

Nonaree took her place behind Granny Rainbow as Sandy and the children waited. Sandy looked into their eyes. She was teaching them all what it took to succeed. They would carry on her legacy. These children and all the children watching at home on Saturday morning.

Sandra tried to take in the moment. The sweet faces of the children. Her idol only feet away from her. The friends she had made in the cast and crew. She didn’t want to forget it. She wished she had worn something more her style for this scene, but Dory had decided that her thigh-high pink dress was her only costume. Still, she had earned this moment, and she wanted to remember it.

Dory boomed from the director’s chair. “Ready the finale!”

Sandra felt the burning on her skin again. Nonaree was watching her. Dory was watching her. The children were watching her. The entire world was watching her. It hurt. She wanted her Mama to be there with her to celebrate just like she had been for all of the pageants. She was gone. She wasn’t coming back. Sandra reviled herself. She was supposed to be happy, but she was too weak.

“Action!”

Sandy smiled into the camera and waited for her cue. Like with Maggie, Granny Rainbow would sing the first round of the song, and she would join in the second. The children would join in the third. Granny Rainbow started up.

*If you’re not feeling happy today…*

Her voice was wrong. It wasn’t the award-winning croon of Nonaree Nell. It was brash, offkey. It sounded like Sunday mornings and uncomfortable dresses. It sounded like singing hymns in St. Bee’s. It sounded like her mother. Was she there after all? Breaking character, Sandra reached her head to look at Nonaree.

The children looked confused. Dory looked furious. “Cut! Damn it, Sandra…”

Sandra’s heart broke. Of course her mother wasn’t there. Behind the technicolor rainbow, there was only her idol looking frustrated. Sandra had known it all along. She wanted this, but she couldn’t handle it. She had made a mistake. She had failed.

For the last time.

They wanted a doll. Someone who could smile even when she wanted to scream. She had tried to be her. She had tried to be Sunny Sandy. She couldn’t. She had too many feelings, too much of a heart. She was made of flesh. The world needed plastic. She couldn’t break down. Not where they could see.

She needed to run. To hide. But where could she run? Cast and crew were waiting on either side of the stage. Dory was standing in front of her glaring. With her world spinning and nowhere else to go, she turned towards the cloth field behind her.

She saw a door. Or at least the shape of one. It was a deep shadow of a rectangle. Somehow it appeared inside the field. She reached her hand forward. It went inside. She followed.

She didn’t know where she was going, but she left *Sunnyside Square*. She took what was left of her heart and ran. Behind her, she heard a voice that sounded like hers—only prettier. “Sorry about that, Dory.” The voice giggled. “Let’s take it from the top?”

She heard the crew reset the stage. “Reset! We roll in two!” They didn’t even notice she was gone. Her show would go on without her. It had what it needed. It had Sunny Sandy.

**2024**

Mikey woke when his alarm rang at 6:00. Senior day started early. Sleep had claimed him, but he was more tired than the day before.

He pitched himself out of bed and lumbered to the kitchenette. He almost fell asleep waiting on the coffee machine. His legs buckled when he fell asleep in the shower. As he wrestled the morning, he admitted it was a fight he was going to lose. He had won perfect attendance awards every year in grade school. His mother had never believed in sick days. That morning, Mikey knew she had been wrong.

He picked up his phone from where he had thrown it into his sheets. Bree had sent her morning briefing at 4:45. She survived on coffee and high-functioning anxiety. Mikey texted back.

“Hey. Feeling sick. Can’t make it. Sorry.” Bree read the message immediately. He thought of calling her. It would have been the nice thing to do. The right thing. But he couldn’t bear to hear her voice. This time, there wouldn’t even be any anger to hide in. She would know something was wrong. He turned his phone on vibrate and tossed it on the couch.

He sat down and noticed that his head had stopped spinning. He hadn’t realized it had been reeling like what he had heard of hangovers. He didn’t remember drinking that much the night before, but the empty bottle waited for him in bed.

Still, this wasn’t a hangover. It was less than that. And more. He didn’t just feel loopy. He felt like he was in the wrong place.

When he turned on the TV, the sound split his head with an axe. He turned down the volume, but the noise barely obeyed. Still, he needed the distraction. He clicked through the infomercials and syndicated sitcoms. Most people his age never even had a cord to cut, but Dove Hill local news and C-SPAN were free on cable. He hadn’t watched anything else since those Saturday mornings with Bree.

Joni Jarrett was just signing off when Mikey found channel 3. Mikey always felt bad for her having to start her day in the dark. During the hour’s changeover, the channel aired the low-budget ads for the dentist and the school and the national spots for fast food and a new diabetes medication. The fifth ad was different though.

In it, a large man whose stomach was too big for his suit stood in front of a lot full of clearly used cars. The oversaturated light and amateur production value proved it was local, but there wasn’t a used car dealership in 100 miles of Dove Hill. The man’s hair piece shook as he shouted his pitch. Mikey felt nauseous watching it shiver.

“Hey, hey, hey! Come on down to Papa’s Playhouse where the low prices aren’t pretend!” Mikey’s head cracked again as Papa’s shout made the TV impossibly louder. Under a slithering saxophone solo, the screen showed a line of cars that looked like they were manufactured well before the turn of the millennium. “Hurry quick because we aren’t hiding these deals! Seek them now before they’re gone!”

Mikey breathed a sigh of relief when Papa left the screen. It was 7:00: time for the channel 3 news. The music should have been the Muzak jingle that the station had used since the 1970s. Instead, it was Sunny Sandy singing her theme song. The piano that played along came from somewhere in Mikey’s apartment.

\*	\*	\*

By the time the ghostly piano played its last phrase, Mikey was back in the center of the Square. No time had passed in the last day of his life. When he opened his eyes, Sandy’s were staring at him like he was a statue she was carving from stone.

“Now!” she said in a mechanical squee. “Where are my other friends?” Mikey knew it was time for another call-and-response. “Say it with me.”

After the compelled introduction, Mikey didn’t even try to fight. He remembered his part. Together, the two shouted, “Howdy dee! Howdy day! Where is everyone today?” When Sandy’s voice rose, it sounded like she was projecting to the last aisle of a crowded theatre.

The piano started up again. Its sound was distant. Was it still playing from his apartment? Or from the black above them? As its invisible mallets struck its hidden strings, the animals emerged from their rooms. One by one, they bounced towards Sandy and encircled her and Mikey. He could tell that they had also learned to not struggle against their matriarch.

Maggie stood to Mikey’s right side. Tommy was to his left. The others—now including a purple pig and a silver spider—completed the embrace. Mikey realized he had never seen them in full. They weren’t humanoid. They each kept their characteristic shapes. Maggie, Tommy, and the pig on all fours; the owl and the chickens on their talons; and the rabbit on its haunches. They weren’t humans, but they were people. With hearts and minds they were clinging to under Sandy’s uncompromising benevolence. Even before he was brought to the Square, Mikey knew that pain. These were his allies.

“Thank you for joining us, friends!” Sandy believed it was a kindness to pretend like they had a choice. In the past, one of them might have corrected her. Now they didn’t dare. “I’d like you to meet our new friend: Mikey Dobson!” The animals smiled at him with a commiserating kindness. “He’s a very good boy.” He didn’t want to know what Sandy would become if he wasn’t.

“Now what are we going to do today?” Mikey remembered that this is where every episode really started. Every day in *Sunnyside Square* started with a game, and each had very specific rules. Mikey had always liked that part of the show. He looked around the circle expecting one of his friends to answer Sandy’s question. When their lips pinched in silent fear, he remembered that this wasn’t the Square he had known.

“Oh! I know!” Her voice was that of a fairytale princess who had become an authoritarian monarch. “We’ll play Hide and Seek!” The animals stood quiet for a fleeting moment before the light coming from Sandy’s eyes turned harsh with confident expectation. Mikey’s friends cheered as demanded. He followed their lead.

The red rabbit raised his paw and asked eagerly, “Sandy! Sandy! Can I please help teach our new friend the rules?” Mikey noticed his foot thumping anxiously.

“Oh! That is such a sunny idea!” Sunny said. “Thank you, Rupert! That will be a very nice thing to do!” Rupert concealed a flinch when she gave his head a firm tap.

“Now, do we all remember the rules? I’m going to close my eyes and count to 100. Then you’ll all hide somewhere you feel safe. Then I’ll come find you.” There was a threatening fist in the velvet glove of that promise. “Mikey, Rupert will teach you the rest.” She giggled eagerly.

The animals nodded politely, and Mikey played along. Sandy placed her hands over her eyes like the young playmate she still should have been. “One, two—”

This was Mikey’s chance. He broke through the circle and towards the imposing front door. He took a short sigh of relief when he found it unlocked. As he ran out, he looked on with confusion at his animal friends walking grudgingly to their hiding spots. Didn’t they want to leave too?

Rupert was the only one to match Mikey’s speed. He called out to Mikey as the two ran out of the park. “Wait! Stop! That’s not how the game works. Not anymore…” Mikey didn’t stop to listen.

He first tried to hide in the post office right across the street from Sandy’s house. He flung open the door and started to enter. He had forgotten about the black behind the buildings. He caught his foot just as it was about to fall into an abyss swirling with trails of dust. Catching his breath for only a moment, he slammed the door as he ran around the Square.

Rupert did his best to follow along. “Mikey, let me help you. You know I’m your friend.” He wanted to trust Rupert, but he couldn’t trust anyone here.

Sandy was coming. Her voice blared from her house like a tornado siren. “Twenty-two, twenty-three…”

Mikey passed more doors into the void. One for a bakery that didn’t exist. Another for what looked like a school. Then a church with a golden plaque reading “St. Beatrice’s.” All the while, Rupert hopped frantically behind him. “Please…”

Mikey only stopped when he came to a long window with a real room behind it. It looked like a library. Like Mrs. Brown’s bookstore. He threw himself through the door as its bell tingled above him. Rupert finally caught up to him when he was hiding between two bookshelves that must not have been touched for an eternity. From his hiding spot, Mikey could see the back of Sandy’s house through the window. Her garden was filled with statues of kind-looking creatures that he assumed were animals.

Sandy’s voice shined on. “Sixty-six, sixty-seven…”

Rupert hopped up to Mikey. With Mikey crouching, they were almost nose to nose. “Thank you. I was trying to follow you.”

“You’re welcome?” Mikey asked. Something old inside him knew he shouldn’t be afraid of Rupert, but he knew it wasn’t safe to trust him. It had been years since he had truly trusted anyone but Bree.

“Now listen,” Rupert continued. “Hiding like this is not going to work. That’s not how Hide and Seek works. Not now.” Mikey eyed him suspiciously. “The Square is too small for that. It’s not just about hiding your body. It’s about hiding your feelings. You have to be sunny. If she sees you looking scared or upset or angry or anything else…” Rupert’s muzzle quivered.

“Then…what happens?” Mikey asked.

“You’re Out.”

“Out? What does that mean?”

“Seventy-nine, eighty…”

Rupert huffed with frightened impatience. “We’re running out of time.” Mikey’s survival instincts held him in place. His bones told he should take up less space.

“Out,” Rupert explained desperately. “Into the black behind the buildings. It’s dark and dusty and—”

“Ninety-nine, one hundred. Ready or not, here I come!”

Mikey couldn’t move. Rupert matched his voice to the speed of his pounding feet. “Time and space don’t exist. It’s just you and the light beams too far above to see. You forget who you are: your thoughts, your feelings…even your name. Before long, you’re just…fine. Fine…but empty.”

Rupert’s ears twitched when he heard Sandy’s heels clacking on the bricks outside. Mikey saw the front of her pink skirt intrude into the window.

“Mikey,” Rupert begged. “You have to feel better. *Now.*”

Sandy heard Rupert’s whisper shake. Mikey saw her turn her rosy cheeks to stare through them. “Silly, Mikey! Silly, Rupert! There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s just Sunny Sandy!” She continued her cheerful walk down the sidewalk.

Mikey lunged from his hiding spot between the shelves and shouldered past Rupert. “I’m sorry. For everything.” He bolted out the door so narrowly that he could smell Sandy as she reached for him. She smelled like a candy-scented permanent marker.

Mikey ran down the brick sidewalks and past more doors to Out. He didn’t know where he was going. He just had to get away from Sandy. As he turned the corner, his foot caught on the bend in the path. He tried to catch himself, but his elbow struck the ground. His arm vibrated down to the bone.

He heard Sandy’s heels walking up behind him. He couldn’t bear to look. “Oops! Did Mikey hurt himself? That’s what happens when you make mistakes. I’ll fix it.” Her sweetness made him want to vomit.

\*	\*	\*

When he opened his eyes, he was back in his apartment. His heart was making his entire chest shake. He felt his phone vibrating from the other side of the couch. He didn’t have to look to know it was Bree. When it stopped, he saw that she had called twenty times in the last two hours. Had it only been that long?

He pressed the screen to call her back. Apparently she was not going to let him be sick alone. She answered halfway through the first ring.

“Hey, brother.” There was the worry he had been dreading. It only lasted a minute before the fixing started. “We need to get you feeling better now. We’re supposed to have the walk-through of the auditorium today. What do you need?”

“Hey Bree. Sorry I missed your calls. I was resting.”

“It’s fine. What can I do? What do you need to feel better?” He could hear her biting the impatience in her tongue. Bree always wanted to fix the problem. Understanding it wasn’t important. Mikey knew this wasn’t the kind of problem Bree could fix. She couldn’t so much as understand it even if he could explain it somehow.

“I’m okay. I slept in, and it helped. What happened with the seniors?”

“Don’t worry about it. I made it work. What matters is tomorrow night. Are you going to be able to debate?” It was more a demand than a question, but it was a demand from desperation. Mikey couldn’t let his sister—or himself—down. Not again.

“Yeah. Of course. I’ll be fine. I’m going to go into the office to catch up on some work. Then I’ll meet you at the high school.” He tried to convince them both with false confidence. Part of him hoped Bree would hear the dishonesty.

“Okay. That sounds smart.” She paused. “Mikey…” He could hear the uncertainty in her breath. He wished she would ask again, demand he tell her the truth. It was the only way he could.

“What’s up?”

“Remember, tonight is at 6. Don’t be late.”

He knew better. “See you then.”

Mikey didn’t bother to shave or change before he went to the office. He knew Dove Hill well enough to know he wouldn’t see anyone on his route on a Thursday morning. Still, he put on some deodorant and a baseball cap just in case.

When he arrived, he was still reeling. By then, he knew it couldn’t be from the wine more than twelve before. He thought he might be even less stable without it lingering in his blood. The dizziness was from hide and seek with Sandy. As he climbed the weathered stone stairs, his shoelace caught in one of the cracks. He tried to catch himself but landed on his elbow. Exactly where he had struck it running out of the bookstore. His eyes squeezed shut in fresh pain.

**\***	**\***	**\***

He was still feeling the crash when he opened his eyes to see the inside of a doctor’s office. Or at least a caricature of one. The walls were a sickly sky blue painted with large clouds. The clouds would have been a comfort if they were not lined like sheet metal. Between the sharp clouds were anatomical diagrams of what he thought were supposed to be humans. The artist had seen a human but never been one. Instead of ligaments and skin, the people in the diagrams were made of large colorful shapes arranged in the frames of men and women.

Someone was holding a sign in front of Mikey. He had seen something like it when he saw Dr. Tate as a boy. It showed six cartoons of Mikey’s face ranging from a Mikey with a crying Mikey on the left to a smiling Mikey on the right. The crying Mikey was the picture of pure pain. The smiling Mikey’s lips were stretched so tightly that the skin was splitting around them. It was Sandy’s smile. From left to right, the Mikeys were labeled “Bad,” “At Least You’re Trying,” “Not There Yet,” “Good Effort,” “Almost Enough,” and “Good.” Sandy’s pink-pointed finger was hovering between “At Least You’re Trying” and “Not There Yet.”

“Dr. Percy,” Sandy chimed. She sounded like the pleading ingenue she had been once. “You can make Mikey better, can’t you?” Mikey looked up from the sign and saw Sandy talking to a purple pig in a doctor’s coat standing on his hind hooves. His other animal friends were standing along the walls waiting on their turn to speak. Mikey wasn’t sure if they had chosen their silence.

“Of course, I can,” Dr. Percy answered with over-rehearsed confidence. Sandy’s tone had told him the answer. She coughed politely to tell him to finish his line. Dr Percy looked at Mikey and smiled through, “I’m a doctor. I can always make you feel better.” His voice carried a sad knowledge.

“Oh good! I know we can always count on you, Dr. Percy!” Sandy cheered. The other animals joined in her ritual joy. Mikey knew he had to play along.

“Thank you, Dr. Percy. I am so thankful for your work.” As he reached his other hand to shake Dr. Percy’s hoof, Mikey’s broken elbow throbbed in improper pain. Sandy discreetly pursed her lips when Mikey recoiled before completing the gesture.

“You’re welcome, Mikey,” Dr. Percy sighed. “It’s what I’m here for.”

“Shouldn’t we call for Nurse Silvia?” Sandy dictated.

“I suppose so.”

On cue, Dr. Percy and the rest of Mikey’s friends joined Sandy in calling, “Oh, Nurse Silvia!” Immediately, a silver spider with the calm air of a veteran nurse entered the room through the white wooden door.

“Yes?” she said hopefully. Mikey could tell she wanted to help. She hoped she would be allowed to.

“We need your help to fix our friend Mikey,” Sandy explained. “You always know just what to do.”

With Sandy’s last sentence, the hope left Silvia’s eyes. She knew that she was not going to be allowed to do what needed to be done. Only what Sandy demanded ever so sweetly.

“Okay, everyone.” Silvia recited. She looked at the rest of the animals as though she were teaching teenagers about the letter S. She knew how unreal this was. “We know how we heal our friends in the Square. Count with me now!”

The animals started counting in unison. “One.” Mikey saw Sandy pucker her lips. “Two.” She reached down to his elbow. His nerves screamed for him to move it, but he knew he couldn’t. It wouldn’t have been nice. “Three.” On three, Sandy kissed the part of Mikey’s bone that had broken through his skin. Somewhere, the piano played a triumphant melody.

“There,” Sandy said with pride. “All better.” Mikey felt nothing. The bone was still.

He looked into Sandy’s eyes. He expected to see malice or spite. The look of someone gloating in their punishment of his transgressions. What he saw made his blood stop cold. Sandy truly thought she had cured him. She thought she had helped.

Before Mikey’s blood could continue pumping, Sandy and the animals erupted in cheer. They all thanked Sandy and told her how special she was. Sandy grandly turned to Dr. Percy and Silvia. “No, no, friends. I didn’t do anything. It was all Dr. Percy and Nurse Silvia. Let’s thank them together.”

“Thank you, Dr. Percy and Nurse Silvia!” the whole room chorused. The two helpers beamed painfully through the applause.

Dr. Percy knew his next line. “Of course, it’s our job.”

Nurse Silvia didn’t want to speak. She had to. “You’ll always feel better when you go to the doctor.” The hairs on Mikey’s neck raised with the sense of watching eyes.

\*	\*	\*

When the stone surface rematerialized under his palms, Mikey still sensed that he was being watched. He turned his head to see a sweaty young man in a tight tank top staring at him like the animals had stared at him in Dr. Percy’s office. “I’m good. Just checking the foundation,” Mikey shouted with attempted ease. The man waved and jogged away. Mikey went to wave back and felt his arm tighten. It was still sore, but it wasn’t broken. When he looked down, there was no sign it ever was.

His blood rushed to his head as he stood up. If he had been dizzy when he fell, he had become a spinning top. His stomach convulsed either from motion sickness or from the afterimage of what he had last seen in the Square. When he walked under the ringing entry bell and lumbered his way to his desk, he felt like he needed something to steady his nerves. He remembered a bottle of champagne he had opened months ago to celebrate a win in an employment discrimination lawsuit. He opened the bottom drawer of his desk. It was still there. Looking in the dusty bottle, he could tell it had gone bad. None of the bubbles had survived. The bottle’s lip tasted like mothballs, and the liquid felt like stale water on his tongue. He drank it anyway.

He settled in to work before realizing he had left his laptop in his car. He figured it would be fine. What was the worst that could happen? Still determined to play his part, he opened an unmarked file he had tossed to the side of his desk. Inside he found the purchase agreement for Quality Care’s acquisition of Dr. Tate’s clinic. Mikey wondered if Dr. Percy ever had to deal with buyouts. He laughed to himself as he realized that Sandy would never allow such a thing. His eyes grew heavy as he pored over the bulletproof boilerplate he had written.

\*	\*	\*

Before he could turn to the second page of jumbled jargon, he was back in Sandy’s house. Someone had taken him from Dr. Percy’s clinic and tucked him into a bed that was too big for his body. His feet only reached halfway down, and his limbs drowned in the sharply starched white sheets. The bed set in the dead center of a room lined in the same haunted sky and cutting clouds as the clinic. Above Mikey’s head loomed a large letter M carved into the ceiling’s dark wood. This was *his* room. He wondered how many other people had their own rooms in Sandy’s house.

He could feel the artificial sunlight coming in from a large heart-shaped window to his left. In his periphery, he could see that the window opened onto the spherical cage formed by the park’s tree limbs. He remembered that the stairs from the entranceway rose into black. From there, he hadn’t been able to see a second story. How was he on one? Was his room the only one with a roof?

As his heart raced to a higher tempo, Mikey tried to soothe his rising fear by looking out the window. He pushed up with his arms only to feel the unhinged bone shift. No one had closed his wound since Sandy’s failed kiss. He opened his mouth to scream, but he remembered the rule. “If you can’t say anything nice, you won’t say anything at all.” After the last time, he didn’t bother to try.

He laid his head back on his pillow. It felt like it was filled with fiberglass insulation. He winced before remembering this was probably the safest place in the Square. At least he was alone. At least Sandy didn’t light up the dark room with her blinding effervescence.

Mikey heard scuttling coming from the window sill he couldn’t see. He held his breath and felt six points of pressure on his foot. They were soft and pliable like fingers made of the fuzzy pipes he had once used in arts and crafts. The fingers crawled up his leg, then onto his stomach, then through the valleys of skin over his rib cage.

His nerves began to form a scream in his throat. There was a spider crawling near his mouth. “Shh…” it said calmly. He noticed that, in the barely sunlit room, her silver felt made her look like an old woman. Like the kind of nurse you only see in picture books. “It’s okay, honey,” she whispered. “You’re safe here.” Nurse Silvia sitting on his chest. 

Mikey’s eyes flashed with remembered fear. Sandy couldn’t see him in the dark, and she couldn’t hear him in the quiet. But could she still *feel* him? Silvia recognized the terror in his eyes. “It’s alright, Mikey. I know you’re scared. You’d be a fool not to be. But Sandy can only feel what she can see. That’s all that’s left of her.” There was a sadness in this last assurance. “Now let me fix you up for real.”

Mikey’s nerves started to relax. There was a spider in his bed, but she was a friend. He remembered that she had wanted to help him in the clinic. She just hadn’t been allowed. “Thank you, Silvia.” It was the first genuine thing Mikey had said in the Square.

“It’s what I do,” Silvia answered. “Come on now. I can’t move the sheet myself.” Mikey lifted the sheet to expose his bare bone to Silvia.

“Is that okay?” he asked.

“That’ll do, dearie. Now,” she said as she climbed onto the end of his bone. “This will sting a bit.” Mikey nodded. He chose to trust Silvia.

His spider friend then began to weave a cast around his elbow. As she spun it tighter and tighter, the bones began to line up again. Mikey couldn’t tell where her silk came from, but it shone like faint moonlight in the dimness of the room. When she was finished, Mikey realized he had not been breathing. This time, it wasn’t from fear. It was from awe. And gratitude. His arm still hurt, but he could already feel it healing.

“There now,” she cooed. “That should be a start.” She scurried back onto his chest.

After a silent moment, Mikey began to find his words again. “How—how did you do that? It was incredible.” He had been terrified to let her so close to him even though he knew she was a friend. It didn’t make sense. She was a spider nurse crawling on his chest in a giant’s bed sitting in a dark room in a place he knew didn’t exist. But letting her touch his wound had let her help it start healing.

“I’ve been doing this for a long time, Mikey,” Silvia said with pride. “Sandy doesn’t like my methods, so she takes care of the healing herself.”

“Or she tries to.”

“She tries her best. She just doesn’t understand that healing isn’t pretty. It’s messy, even ugly. But it’s real. And it helps. Never perfectly and certainly never easily. But it helps if you let it.

Mikey hoped what Silvia said was true. He needed to heal a lot more than his elbow.

Silvia continued to smile at him with a grandmother’s warmth. “Now, try to get some rest. It’s nap time now. Sandy will call us for snack time soon.” Silvia climbed out the window, and, for just a fleeting moment, Mikey felt calm—even in the Square.",1,1763127623.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

**1999**

Sandra only lived fleeting moments of the next day on set. Most of the time, Sunny Sandy stood in for her. Sandra’s soul threatened to break under the tension between her mourning and her determination. Sandy didn’t have to feel anything. She only had to sing and smile.

After a lunch she didn’t remember eating, Sandra realized that surrendering to Sandy was easy. Looking back, she had been doing it her entire life. Every time her mother pinched her for whispering questions during church. Every time a teacher called her stupid. Every time a boy touched her without asking. Sandy was there. Sandy was who she was always meant to be. She was the one the world wanted.

When Dory called for the final scene of the day, Sandy was ready. She sat on her plain wooden stool in front of the green field on the backdrop. It was a country scene painted masterfully by artists who had never been to the country. It was unreal in its perfection. It was made for Sunny Sandy.

At Dory’s reluctant cue, the child actors took their places around her. He had been dreading the children all day. They arced around Sandy like the giant wooden rainbow arced over them all. It was colored with precise, unblemished curves showing every color of the rainbow in a strident technicolor hue. In the middle of its bend, the rainbow had large googly eyes and a small smile with dimples at the ends. It was Granny Rainbow, the character Sandra had created in honor of her Granny Ruth. Now, Sandy, Granny Rainbow, and these children were going to sing the last song of the show’s first season: a reprise of “Put On a Smiling Face.”

“Is Mrs. Nell ready?” Dory called to Caroline.

“Yes sir!” Then into her walkie, “Mrs. Nell to set, please.”

Nonaree Nell glowed as she walked into the sound stage. She was the network’s first country star, and Sandra had watched her with Mama on Sunday nights. Part comedian, part puppeteer, part singer, Nonaree was the woman that had made Sandra want to be on TV. If Nonaree could make it all the way from Cobbler’s Corners, Sandra could make it from Dove Hill.

Standing feet away from Nonaree Nell, Sandra would have made a fool of herself. She would have spoken first or, worse, said she admired Nonaree. Sandy was better than such unprofessional nonsense. This was a job—her job—and she was damn good at it. While Sandra wondered what Mama would say if she could see Nonaree Nell playing the rainbow tribute to her mother, Sandy waited for Dory’s cue.

Nonaree took her place behind Granny Rainbow as Sandy and the children waited. Sandy looked into their eyes. She was teaching them all what it took to succeed. They would carry on her legacy. These children and all the children watching at home on Saturday morning.

Sandra tried to take in the moment. The sweet faces of the children. Her idol only feet away from her. The friends she had made in the cast and crew. She didn’t want to forget it. She wished she had worn something more her style for this scene, but Dory had decided that her thigh-high pink dress was her only costume. Still, she had earned this moment, and she wanted to remember it.

Dory boomed from the director’s chair. “Ready the finale!”

Sandra felt the burning on her skin again. Nonaree was watching her. Dory was watching her. The children were watching her. The entire world was watching her. It hurt. She wanted her Mama to be there with her to celebrate just like she had been for all of the pageants. She was gone. She wasn’t coming back. Sandra reviled herself. She was supposed to be happy, but she was too weak.

“Action!”

Sandy smiled into the camera and waited for her cue. Like with Maggie, Granny Rainbow would sing the first round of the song, and she would join in the second. The children would join in the third. Granny Rainbow started up.

*If you’re not feeling happy today…*

Her voice was wrong. It wasn’t the award-winning croon of Nonaree Nell. It was brash, offkey. It sounded like Sunday mornings and uncomfortable dresses. It sounded like singing hymns in St. Bee’s. It sounded like her mother. Was she there after all? Breaking character, Sandra reached her head to look at Nonaree.

The children looked confused. Dory looked furious. “Cut! Damn it, Sandra…”

Sandra’s heart broke. Of course her mother wasn’t there. Behind the technicolor rainbow, there was only her idol looking frustrated. Sandra had known it all along. She wanted this, but she couldn’t handle it. She had made a mistake. She had failed.

For the last time.

They wanted a doll. Someone who could smile even when she wanted to scream. She had tried to be her. She had tried to be Sunny Sandy. She couldn’t. She had too many feelings, too much of a heart. She was made of flesh. The world needed plastic. She couldn’t break down. Not where they could see.

She needed to run. To hide. But where could she run? Cast and crew were waiting on either side of the stage. Dory was standing in front of her glaring. With her world spinning and nowhere else to go, she turned towards the cloth field behind her.

She saw a door. Or at least the shape of one. It was a deep shadow of a rectangle. Somehow it appeared inside the field. She reached her hand forward. It went inside. She followed.

She didn’t know where she was going, but she left *Sunnyside Square*. She took what was left of her heart and ran. Behind her, she heard a voice that sounded like hers—only prettier. “Sorry about that, Dory.” The voice giggled. “Let’s take it from the top?”

She heard the crew reset the stage. “Reset! We roll in two!” They didn’t even notice she was gone. Her show would go on without her. It had what it needed. It had Sunny Sandy.

**2024**

Mikey woke when his alarm rang at 6:00. Senior day started early. Sleep had claimed him, but he was more tired than the day before.

He pitched himself out of bed and lumbered to the kitchenette. He almost fell asleep waiting on the coffee machine. His legs buckled when he fell asleep in the shower. As he wrestled the morning, he admitted it was a fight he was going to lose. He had won perfect attendance awards every year in grade school. His mother had never believed in sick days. That morning, Mikey knew she had been wrong.

He picked up his phone from where he had thrown it into his sheets. Bree had sent her morning briefing at 4:45. She survived on coffee and high-functioning anxiety. Mikey texted back.

“Hey. Feeling sick. Can’t make it. Sorry.” Bree read the message immediately. He thought of calling her. It would have been the nice thing to do. The right thing. But he couldn’t bear to hear her voice. This time, there wouldn’t even be any anger to hide in. She would know something was wrong. He turned his phone on vibrate and tossed it on the couch.

He sat down and noticed that his head had stopped spinning. He hadn’t realized it had been reeling like what he had heard of hangovers. He didn’t remember drinking that much the night before, but the empty bottle waited for him in bed.

Still, this wasn’t a hangover. It was less than that. And more. He didn’t just feel loopy. He felt like he was in the wrong place.

When he turned on the TV, the sound split his head with an axe. He turned down the volume, but the noise barely obeyed. Still, he needed the distraction. He clicked through the infomercials and syndicated sitcoms. Most people his age never even had a cord to cut, but Dove Hill local news and C-SPAN were free on cable. He hadn’t watched anything else since those Saturday mornings with Bree.

Joni Jarrett was just signing off when Mikey found channel 3. Mikey always felt bad for her having to start her day in the dark. During the hour’s changeover, the channel aired the low-budget ads for the dentist and the school and the national spots for fast food and a new diabetes medication. The fifth ad was different though.

In it, a large man whose stomach was too big for his suit stood in front of a lot full of clearly used cars. The oversaturated light and amateur production value proved it was local, but there wasn’t a used car dealership in 100 miles of Dove Hill. The man’s hair piece shook as he shouted his pitch. Mikey felt nauseous watching it shiver.

“Hey, hey, hey! Come on down to Papa’s Playhouse where the low prices aren’t pretend!” Mikey’s head cracked again as Papa’s shout made the TV impossibly louder. Under a slithering saxophone solo, the screen showed a line of cars that looked like they were manufactured well before the turn of the millennium. “Hurry quick because we aren’t hiding these deals! Seek them now before they’re gone!”

Mikey breathed a sigh of relief when Papa left the screen. It was 7:00: time for the channel 3 news. The music should have been the Muzak jingle that the station had used since the 1970s. Instead, it was Sunny Sandy singing her theme song. The piano that played along came from somewhere in Mikey’s apartment.

\*	\*	\*

By the time the ghostly piano played its last phrase, Mikey was back in the center of the Square. No time had passed in the last day of his life. When he opened his eyes, Sandy’s were staring at him like he was a statue she was carving from stone.

“Now!” she said in a mechanical squee. “Where are my other friends?” Mikey knew it was time for another call-and-response. “Say it with me.”

After the compelled introduction, Mikey didn’t even try to fight. He remembered his part. Together, the two shouted, “Howdy dee! Howdy day! Where is everyone today?” When Sandy’s voice rose, it sounded like she was projecting to the last aisle of a crowded theatre.

The piano started up again. Its sound was distant. Was it still playing from his apartment? Or from the black above them? As its invisible mallets struck its hidden strings, the animals emerged from their rooms. One by one, they bounced towards Sandy and encircled her and Mikey. He could tell that they had also learned to not struggle against their matriarch.

Maggie stood to Mikey’s right side. Tommy was to his left. The others—now including a purple pig and a silver spider—completed the embrace. Mikey realized he had never seen them in full. They weren’t humanoid. They each kept their characteristic shapes. Maggie, Tommy, and the pig on all fours; the owl and the chickens on their talons; and the rabbit on its haunches. They weren’t humans, but they were people. With hearts and minds they were clinging to under Sandy’s uncompromising benevolence. Even before he was brought to the Square, Mikey knew that pain. These were his allies.

“Thank you for joining us, friends!” Sandy believed it was a kindness to pretend like they had a choice. In the past, one of them might have corrected her. Now they didn’t dare. “I’d like you to meet our new friend: Mikey Dobson!” The animals smiled at him with a commiserating kindness. “He’s a very good boy.” He didn’t want to know what Sandy would become if he wasn’t.

“Now what are we going to do today?” Mikey remembered that this is where every episode really started. Every day in *Sunnyside Square* started with a game, and each had very specific rules. Mikey had always liked that part of the show. He looked around the circle expecting one of his friends to answer Sandy’s question. When their lips pinched in silent fear, he remembered that this wasn’t the Square he had known.

“Oh! I know!” Her voice was that of a fairytale princess who had become an authoritarian monarch. “We’ll play Hide and Seek!” The animals stood quiet for a fleeting moment before the light coming from Sandy’s eyes turned harsh with confident expectation. Mikey’s friends cheered as demanded. He followed their lead.

The red rabbit raised his paw and asked eagerly, “Sandy! Sandy! Can I please help teach our new friend the rules?” Mikey noticed his foot thumping anxiously.

“Oh! That is such a sunny idea!” Sunny said. “Thank you, Rupert! That will be a very nice thing to do!” Rupert concealed a flinch when she gave his head a firm tap.

“Now, do we all remember the rules? I’m going to close my eyes and count to 100. Then you’ll all hide somewhere you feel safe. Then I’ll come find you.” There was a threatening fist in the velvet glove of that promise. “Mikey, Rupert will teach you the rest.” She giggled eagerly.

The animals nodded politely, and Mikey played along. Sandy placed her hands over her eyes like the young playmate she still should have been. “One, two—”

This was Mikey’s chance. He broke through the circle and towards the imposing front door. He took a short sigh of relief when he found it unlocked. As he ran out, he looked on with confusion at his animal friends walking grudgingly to their hiding spots. Didn’t they want to leave too?

Rupert was the only one to match Mikey’s speed. He called out to Mikey as the two ran out of the park. “Wait! Stop! That’s not how the game works. Not anymore…” Mikey didn’t stop to listen.

He first tried to hide in the post office right across the street from Sandy’s house. He flung open the door and started to enter. He had forgotten about the black behind the buildings. He caught his foot just as it was about to fall into an abyss swirling with trails of dust. Catching his breath for only a moment, he slammed the door as he ran around the Square.

Rupert did his best to follow along. “Mikey, let me help you. You know I’m your friend.” He wanted to trust Rupert, but he couldn’t trust anyone here.

Sandy was coming. Her voice blared from her house like a tornado siren. “Twenty-two, twenty-three…”

Mikey passed more doors into the void. One for a bakery that didn’t exist. Another for what looked like a school. Then a church with a golden plaque reading “St. Beatrice’s.” All the while, Rupert hopped frantically behind him. “Please…”

Mikey only stopped when he came to a long window with a real room behind it. It looked like a library. Like Mrs. Brown’s bookstore. He threw himself through the door as its bell tingled above him. Rupert finally caught up to him when he was hiding between two bookshelves that must not have been touched for an eternity. From his hiding spot, Mikey could see the back of Sandy’s house through the window. Her garden was filled with statues of kind-looking creatures that he assumed were animals.

Sandy’s voice shined on. “Sixty-six, sixty-seven…”

Rupert hopped up to Mikey. With Mikey crouching, they were almost nose to nose. “Thank you. I was trying to follow you.”

“You’re welcome?” Mikey asked. Something old inside him knew he shouldn’t be afraid of Rupert, but he knew it wasn’t safe to trust him. It had been years since he had truly trusted anyone but Bree.

“Now listen,” Rupert continued. “Hiding like this is not going to work. That’s not how Hide and Seek works. Not now.” Mikey eyed him suspiciously. “The Square is too small for that. It’s not just about hiding your body. It’s about hiding your feelings. You have to be sunny. If she sees you looking scared or upset or angry or anything else…” Rupert’s muzzle quivered.

“Then…what happens?” Mikey asked.

“You’re Out.”

“Out? What does that mean?”

“Seventy-nine, eighty…”

Rupert huffed with frightened impatience. “We’re running out of time.” Mikey’s survival instincts held him in place. His bones told he should take up less space.

“Out,” Rupert explained desperately. “Into the black behind the buildings. It’s dark and dusty and—”

“Ninety-nine, one hundred. Ready or not, here I come!”

Mikey couldn’t move. Rupert matched his voice to the speed of his pounding feet. “Time and space don’t exist. It’s just you and the light beams too far above to see. You forget who you are: your thoughts, your feelings…even your name. Before long, you’re just…fine. Fine…but empty.”

Rupert’s ears twitched when he heard Sandy’s heels clacking on the bricks outside. Mikey saw the front of her pink skirt intrude into the window.

“Mikey,” Rupert begged. “You have to feel better. *Now.*”

Sandy heard Rupert’s whisper shake. Mikey saw her turn her rosy cheeks to stare through them. “Silly, Mikey! Silly, Rupert! There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s just Sunny Sandy!” She continued her cheerful walk down the sidewalk.

Mikey lunged from his hiding spot between the shelves and shouldered past Rupert. “I’m sorry. For everything.” He bolted out the door so narrowly that he could smell Sandy as she reached for him. She smelled like a candy-scented permanent marker.

Mikey ran down the brick sidewalks and past more doors to Out. He didn’t know where he was going. He just had to get away from Sandy. As he turned the corner, his foot caught on the bend in the path. He tried to catch himself, but his elbow struck the ground. His arm vibrated down to the bone.

He heard Sandy’s heels walking up behind him. He couldn’t bear to look. “Oops! Did Mikey hurt himself? That’s what happens when you make mistakes. I’ll fix it.” Her sweetness made him want to vomit.

\*	\*	\*

When he opened his eyes, he was back in his apartment. His heart was making his entire chest shake. He felt his phone vibrating from the other side of the couch. He didn’t have to look to know it was Bree. When it stopped, he saw that she had called twenty times in the last two hours. Had it only been that long?

He pressed the screen to call her back. Apparently she was not going to let him be sick alone. She answered halfway through the first ring.

“Hey, brother.” There was the worry he had been dreading. It only lasted a minute before the fixing started. “We need to get you feeling better now. We’re supposed to have the walk-through of the auditorium today. What do you need?”

“Hey Bree. Sorry I missed your calls. I was resting.”

“It’s fine. What can I do? What do you need to feel better?” He could hear her biting the impatience in her tongue. Bree always wanted to fix the problem. Understanding it wasn’t important. Mikey knew this wasn’t the kind of problem Bree could fix. She couldn’t so much as understand it even if he could explain it somehow.

“I’m okay. I slept in, and it helped. What happened with the seniors?”

“Don’t worry about it. I made it work. What matters is tomorrow night. Are you going to be able to debate?” It was more a demand than a question, but it was a demand from desperation. Mikey couldn’t let his sister—or himself—down. Not again.

“Yeah. Of course. I’ll be fine. I’m going to go into the office to catch up on some work. Then I’ll meet you at the high school.” He tried to convince them both with false confidence. Part of him hoped Bree would hear the dishonesty.

“Okay. That sounds smart.” She paused. “Mikey…” He could hear the uncertainty in her breath. He wished she would ask again, demand he tell her the truth. It was the only way he could.

“What’s up?”

“Remember, tonight is at 6. Don’t be late.”

He knew better. “See you then.”

Mikey didn’t bother to shave or change before he went to the office. He knew Dove Hill well enough to know he wouldn’t see anyone on his route on a Thursday morning. Still, he put on some deodorant and a baseball cap just in case.

When he arrived, he was still reeling. By then, he knew it couldn’t be from the wine more than twelve before. He thought he might be even less stable without it lingering in his blood. The dizziness was from hide and seek with Sandy. As he climbed the weathered stone stairs, his shoelace caught in one of the cracks. He tried to catch himself but landed on his elbow. Exactly where he had struck it running out of the bookstore. His eyes squeezed shut in fresh pain.

**\***	**\***	**\***

He was still feeling the crash when he opened his eyes to see the inside of a doctor’s office. Or at least a caricature of one. The walls were a sickly sky blue painted with large clouds. The clouds would have been a comfort if they were not lined like sheet metal. Between the sharp clouds were anatomical diagrams of what he thought were supposed to be humans. The artist had seen a human but never been one. Instead of ligaments and skin, the people in the diagrams were made of large colorful shapes arranged in the frames of men and women.

Someone was holding a sign in front of Mikey. He had seen something like it when he saw Dr. Tate as a boy. It showed six cartoons of Mikey’s face ranging from a Mikey with a crying Mikey on the left to a smiling Mikey on the right. The crying Mikey was the picture of pure pain. The smiling Mikey’s lips were stretched so tightly that the skin was splitting around them. It was Sandy’s smile. From left to right, the Mikeys were labeled “Bad,” “At Least You’re Trying,” “Not There Yet,” “Good Effort,” “Almost Enough,” and “Good.” Sandy’s pink-pointed finger was hovering between “At Least You’re Trying” and “Not There Yet.”

“Dr. Percy,” Sandy chimed. She sounded like the pleading ingenue she had been once. “You can make Mikey better, can’t you?” Mikey looked up from the sign and saw Sandy talking to a purple pig in a doctor’s coat standing on his hind hooves. His other animal friends were standing along the walls waiting on their turn to speak. Mikey wasn’t sure if they had chosen their silence.

“Of course, I can,” Dr. Percy answered with over-rehearsed confidence. Sandy’s tone had told him the answer. She coughed politely to tell him to finish his line. Dr Percy looked at Mikey and smiled through, “I’m a doctor. I can always make you feel better.” His voice carried a sad knowledge.

“Oh good! I know we can always count on you, Dr. Percy!” Sandy cheered. The other animals joined in her ritual joy. Mikey knew he had to play along.

“Thank you, Dr. Percy. I am so thankful for your work.” As he reached his other hand to shake Dr. Percy’s hoof, Mikey’s broken elbow throbbed in improper pain. Sandy discreetly pursed her lips when Mikey recoiled before completing the gesture.

“You’re welcome, Mikey,” Dr. Percy sighed. “It’s what I’m here for.”

“Shouldn’t we call for Nurse Silvia?” Sandy dictated.

“I suppose so.”

On cue, Dr. Percy and the rest of Mikey’s friends joined Sandy in calling, “Oh, Nurse Silvia!” Immediately, a silver spider with the calm air of a veteran nurse entered the room through the white wooden door.

“Yes?” she said hopefully. Mikey could tell she wanted to help. She hoped she would be allowed to.

“We need your help to fix our friend Mikey,” Sandy explained. “You always know just what to do.”

With Sandy’s last sentence, the hope left Silvia’s eyes. She knew that she was not going to be allowed to do what needed to be done. Only what Sandy demanded ever so sweetly.

“Okay, everyone.” Silvia recited. She looked at the rest of the animals as though she were teaching teenagers about the letter S. She knew how unreal this was. “We know how we heal our friends in the Square. Count with me now!”

The animals started counting in unison. “One.” Mikey saw Sandy pucker her lips. “Two.” She reached down to his elbow. His nerves screamed for him to move it, but he knew he couldn’t. It wouldn’t have been nice. “Three.” On three, Sandy kissed the part of Mikey’s bone that had broken through his skin. Somewhere, the piano played a triumphant melody.

“There,” Sandy said with pride. “All better.” Mikey felt nothing. The bone was still.

He looked into Sandy’s eyes. He expected to see malice or spite. The look of someone gloating in their punishment of his transgressions. What he saw made his blood stop cold. Sandy truly thought she had cured him. She thought she had helped.

Before Mikey’s blood could continue pumping, Sandy and the animals erupted in cheer. They all thanked Sandy and told her how special she was. Sandy grandly turned to Dr. Percy and Silvia. “No, no, friends. I didn’t do anything. It was all Dr. Percy and Nurse Silvia. Let’s thank them together.”

“Thank you, Dr. Percy and Nurse Silvia!” the whole room chorused. The two helpers beamed painfully through the applause.

Dr. Percy knew his next line. “Of course, it’s our job.”

Nurse Silvia didn’t want to speak. She had to. “You’ll always feel better when you go to the doctor.” The hairs on Mikey’s neck raised with the sense of watching eyes.

\*	\*	\*

When the stone surface rematerialized under his palms, Mikey still sensed that he was being watched. He turned his head to see a sweaty young man in a tight tank top staring at him like the animals had stared at him in Dr. Percy’s office. “I’m good. Just checking the foundation,” Mikey shouted with attempted ease. The man waved and jogged away. Mikey went to wave back and felt his arm tighten. It was still sore, but it wasn’t broken. When he looked down, there was no sign it ever was.

His blood rushed to his head as he stood up. If he had been dizzy when he fell, he had become a spinning top. His stomach convulsed either from motion sickness or from the afterimage of what he had last seen in the Square. When he walked under the ringing entry bell and lumbered his way to his desk, he felt like he needed something to steady his nerves. He remembered a bottle of champagne he had opened months ago to celebrate a win in an employment discrimination lawsuit. He opened the bottom drawer of his desk. It was still there. Looking in the dusty bottle, he could tell it had gone bad. None of the bubbles had survived. The bottle’s lip tasted like mothballs, and the liquid felt like stale water on his tongue. He drank it anyway.

He settled in to work before realizing he had left his laptop in his car. He figured it would be fine. What was the worst that could happen? Still determined to play his part, he opened an unmarked file he had tossed to the side of his desk. Inside he found the purchase agreement for Quality Care’s acquisition of Dr. Tate’s clinic. Mikey wondered if Dr. Percy ever had to deal with buyouts. He laughed to himself as he realized that Sandy would never allow such a thing. His eyes grew heavy as he pored over the bulletproof boilerplate he had written.

\*	\*	\*

Before he could turn to the second page of jumbled jargon, he was back in Sandy’s house. Someone had taken him from Dr. Percy’s clinic and tucked him into a bed that was too big for his body. His feet only reached halfway down, and his limbs drowned in the sharply starched white sheets. The bed set in the dead center of a room lined in the same haunted sky and cutting clouds as the clinic. Above Mikey’s head loomed a large letter M carved into the ceiling’s dark wood. This was *his* room. He wondered how many other people had their own rooms in Sandy’s house.

He could feel the artificial sunlight coming in from a large heart-shaped window to his left. In his periphery, he could see that the window opened onto the spherical cage formed by the park’s tree limbs. He remembered that the stairs from the entranceway rose into black. From there, he hadn’t been able to see a second story. How was he on one? Was his room the only one with a roof?

As his heart raced to a higher tempo, Mikey tried to soothe his rising fear by looking out the window. He pushed up with his arms only to feel the unhinged bone shift. No one had closed his wound since Sandy’s failed kiss. He opened his mouth to scream, but he remembered the rule. “If you can’t say anything nice, you won’t say anything at all.” After the last time, he didn’t bother to try.

He laid his head back on his pillow. It felt like it was filled with fiberglass insulation. He winced before remembering this was probably the safest place in the Square. At least he was alone. At least Sandy didn’t light up the dark room with her blinding effervescence.

Mikey heard scuttling coming from the window sill he couldn’t see. He held his breath and felt six points of pressure on his foot. They were soft and pliable like fingers made of the fuzzy pipes he had once used in arts and crafts. The fingers crawled up his leg, then onto his stomach, then through the valleys of skin over his rib cage.

His nerves began to form a scream in his throat. There was a spider crawling near his mouth. “Shh…” it said calmly. He noticed that, in the barely sunlit room, her silver felt made her look like an old woman. Like the kind of nurse you only see in picture books. “It’s okay, honey,” she whispered. “You’re safe here.” Nurse Silvia sitting on his chest. 

Mikey’s eyes flashed with remembered fear. Sandy couldn’t see him in the dark, and she couldn’t hear him in the quiet. But could she still *feel* him? Silvia recognized the terror in his eyes. “It’s alright, Mikey. I know you’re scared. You’d be a fool not to be. But Sandy can only feel what she can see. That’s all that’s left of her.” There was a sadness in this last assurance. “Now let me fix you up for real.”

Mikey’s nerves started to relax. There was a spider in his bed, but she was a friend. He remembered that she had wanted to help him in the clinic. She just hadn’t been allowed. “Thank you, Silvia.” It was the first genuine thing Mikey had said in the Square.

“It’s what I do,” Silvia answered. “Come on now. I can’t move the sheet myself.” Mikey lifted the sheet to expose his bare bone to Silvia.

“Is that okay?” he asked.

“That’ll do, dearie. Now,” she said as she climbed onto the end of his bone. “This will sting a bit.” Mikey nodded. He chose to trust Silvia.

His spider friend then began to weave a cast around his elbow. As she spun it tighter and tighter, the bones began to line up again. Mikey couldn’t tell where her silk came from, but it shone like faint moonlight in the dimness of the room. When she was finished, Mikey realized he had not been breathing. This time, it wasn’t from fear. It was from awe. And gratitude. His arm still hurt, but he could already feel it healing.

“There now,” she cooed. “That should be a start.” She scurried back onto his chest.

After a silent moment, Mikey began to find his words again. “How—how did you do that? It was incredible.” He had been terrified to let her so close to him even though he knew she was a friend. It didn’t make sense. She was a spider nurse crawling on his chest in a giant’s bed sitting in a dark room in a place he knew didn’t exist. But letting her touch his wound had let her help it start healing.

“I’ve been doing this for a long time, Mikey,” Silvia said with pride. “Sandy doesn’t like my methods, so she takes care of the healing herself.”

“Or she tries to.”

“She tries her best. She just doesn’t understand that healing isn’t pretty. It’s messy, even ugly. But it’s real. And it helps. Never perfectly and certainly never easily. But it helps if you let it.

Mikey hoped what Silvia said was true. He needed to heal a lot more than his elbow.

Silvia continued to smile at him with a grandmother’s warmth. “Now, try to get some rest. It’s nap time now. Sandy will call us for snack time soon.” Silvia climbed out the window, and, for just a fleeting moment, Mikey felt calm—even in the Square.",1,1763127614.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

1owwr87,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROIArchitech/comments/1owwr87/how_kays_cafe_transformed_their_brand_story_into/,How Kay’s Cafe Transformed Their Brand Story Into a Conversion Engine,"A real case study of how a restaurant-turned-Shopify brand lifted CTR by 171%, doubled conversions, and cut CAC by 38%—all by fixing one thing: its narrative. 

# Why Most Restaurant Brands Struggle Online 

Restaurant founders know their food is excellent. But when they move to Shopify, they quickly realize something painful: 

**“People love us in-store, but online we look exactly like everyone else.”** 

   
Kay’s Cafe, a neighborhood favorite that began selling coffee, sauces, and brunch kits online, faced this exact challenge. Traffic wasn’t a problem. Conversions were. 

They had: 

* Strong products 
* Loyal dine-in guests 
* Decent ad reach 

But they **lacked one thing**:  A narrative that made customers care. 

# The Reality Check: Plenty of Clicks, Not Enough Customers 

Before the narrative overhaul, Kay’s Cafe looked like thousands of other Shopify food brands—generic copy, generic visuals, generic promises. 

**Baseline Metrics (before narrative work)** 

* Meta CTR (prospecting): 0.7% 
* Google Search CTR: 2.1% 
* CPC (Social): $1.80 
* Shopify conversion rate: 1.1% 
* AOV: $24 
* Blended CAC: $42 
* 90-day LTV: $55 
* Blended ROAS: 1.2x 

From the founder: “We’re not doing anything wrong, but it feels like we’re invisible.” 

They weren’t invisible; they were just forgettable. 

# The Real Issue: No Story Customers Could Connect With 

Their brand language was full of predictable lines: 

* “Locally sourced ingredients.” 
* “Crafted with love.” 
* “Family-owned since 2012.” 

All true.   
Non-persuasive. 

**We found three core problems:** 

1. The brand was the hero—not the customer. 
2. Their website reads like a menu, not a narrative. 
3. Ads sold discounts instead of meaning. 

For a restaurant selling online, this is deadly. if customers can’t see their own life in your product, they don’t buy. 

# The Breakthrough: Sell the Ritual, Not the Recipe 

 We rebuilt the entire brand around one insight pulled from interviews and analytics: 

* People weren’t buying food. 
* They were buying moments. 
* Especially weekend rituals. 

 How we discovered it: 

* Interviews with 18 repeat customers 
* GA4 segments (high-intent users, multi-page sessions) 
* Shopify RFM tagging 
* Klaviyo engagement insights 

  
The pattern was unmistakable: Their strongest emotional anchor was **“Sunday mornings at Kay’s.”** 

We built the narrative around that. 

# The New Narrative Framework 

Brand One-Liner 

“Kay’s Cafe brings your favorite weekend rituals home in under 10 minutes.” 

**Story Arc** 

* Before: Rushed mornings, chaotic weekends 
* Moment of discovery: Kay’s makes cafe-style brunch easy at home 
* After: Slow, intentional, shared moments 

 **Proof Drivers** 

* Quick-prep brunch kits 
* Consistent repeat purchases 
* Reviews mentioning “weekend,” “family,” “ritual,” “tradition” 

This wasn’t a new About page. 

It became the foundation for every action, message, and visual. 

 

# Turning Story Into Revenue: What We Changed 

 

**1 Shopify: From Catalog to Experience** 

 Homepage Improvements 

* New headline linked to the ritual: 

“Turn Sunday mornings into your favorite table at Kay’s Cafe.” 

* CTA changed to: 

“Build Your Weekend Ritual” 

* Redesigned sections: 
* “How it works in 10 minutes” 
* “Real Sundays. Real Stories.” 
* Hero bundles instead of individual SKUs 

 

**Product Pages** 

 Each PDP answered three critical questions: 

* Who is this ideal for? 
* What moment does it upgrade? 
* What does it replace? 

**Added**: 

* Serving icons 
* Prep time 
* Genuine reviews tied to the narrative 
* Story-driven cross-sells (“Make it a full brunch experience”) 

**CRO Tools Applied** 

* Heatmaps + scroll analysis 
* A/B tests on headlines, CTA language, and review placement 

 

**2 Meta & Google Ads: From Discounts to Moments** 

 **Top of Funnel** 

* Video ads showcasing brunch-at-home scenes 
* Hooks: 
* “Bring brunch home in 10 minutes.” 
* “Your weekend table never tasted this good.”  

**Middle of Funnel** 

* Social proof ads featuring customer stories (not ratings) 

**Bottom of Funnel** 

* DPAs + reminders tied to specific ritual kits 

 **Technical Execution** 

* Precise UTM naming 
* Automated Meta rules 
* GA4 high-intent audience segments 

This allowed us to measure which narrative theme converted best. 

 

**3 Retention: LTV Anchored to the Same Story** 

 Welcome Flow (3-Step) 

1. The story of Kay’s Sunday table 
2. “What’s your weekend style?” mini quiz 
3. Recommended ritual bundle 

 

**Post-Purchase** 

* “How to recreate the Kay’s Cafe experience at home” 

 

**Win-Back** 

* “Your Sunday table misses you.” 

 By aligning the story across ads, site, and email, retention skyrocketed. 



# The Results: What Happened Next 

**Paid Media** 

* Meta CTR: 0.7% → 1.9% 
* Google CTR: 2.1% → 3.4% 
* CPC: $1.80 → $1.10 

**Shopify Performance** 

* Conversion Rate: 1.1% → 2.4% 
* AOV: $24 → $32 

**Business Metrics** 

* CAC: $42 → $26 
* 90-Day LTV: $55 → $88 
* ROAS: 1.2x → 3.1x 

**Funnel Snapshot (Month 4 vs Month 1)** 

* Sessions: 18,000 → 21,500 
* Orders: 198 → 516 
* Revenue: \~$4,750 → \~$16,500 
* Ad Spend: No increase 

The transformation came from narrative alignment—not higher spending. 

 

# What Restaurant Shopify Brands Can Do Right Now 

**Step 1: Define Your Core Moment** 

Complete this sentence: 

“We upgrade \_\_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_\_.” 

**Step 2: Build Your Store Around That Moment** 

* Rewrite the hero section 
* Group products by rituals, not categories 
* Add story bullets to every PDP 

**Step 3: Make Your Ads Tell One Consistent Story** 

* Build creative themes around emotional moments 
* Track each narrative with clean UTMs 
* Pause low-CTR creatives before they bleed spend 

**Step 4: Use Email To Reinforce The Ritual** 

* Story-first welcome Flow 
* Post-purchase instructions 
* Win-back reminders tied to familiar moments 

This is how you turn storytelling into higher CTR, stronger conversions, and better LTV. 

 

# AEO-Focused Q&A (Answer Engine Optimized) 

**How does a brand story improve conversions for restaurant Shopify brands?** 

A strong narrative creates emotional relevance, guiding customers from curiosity to purchase. It lifts CTR, reduces CPC, increases on-site engagement, and improves conversion rates. 

 

**Which metrics prove a brand narrative is working?** 

Watch for higher CTR, improved conversion rate, higher AOV, lower CAC, and rising LTV. 

 

**How long until the results show?** 

Initial shifts appear in 3–4 weeks; deeper CAC and LTV improvements show within 60–90 days. 

 

# If Kay’s Cafe Sounds Like Your Brand Today 

If your restaurant brand is getting traffic but not conversions, a narrative reset may be the fastest way to reduce CAC and lift LTV.

In fact, trying to review on test day often does more harm than good. The same principle applies the day before the exam. Your mind needs rest, not more pressure. Think of a marathon runner preparing for race day. No serious athlete wakes up and runs several miles before stepping onto the starting line. They conserve their physical and mental energy so they can perform at their peak. Your approach to the GMAT should be no different. You want to walk into the exam center with a clear mind, sharp focus, and a sense of calm readiness.

The most valuable actions you can take on test day are the ones that put you in the right headspace and get you to the exam on time. Everything should revolve around helping you feel centered, steady, and well prepared. These habits may seem simple, but they carry significant impact when you are about to take a high-stakes exam.

For example, you might start your day by waking up early enough to move slowly and avoid any sense of being rushed. Enjoy a healthy breakfast that fuels you without weighing you down. If you benefit from meditation or visualization, spend a few minutes calming your mind and mentally rehearsing your success. Light stretching or gentle yoga can help release tension and steady your breathing. Staying hydrated is important, as is having your morning coffee if that is part of your normal routine. Test day is not the time to change habits that keep you functioning well.

Your environment matters too. If you are taking the GMAT online, take a moment to ensure that your room and desk are organized and quiet. A clean, prepared space helps reduce distractions. If you are taking the exam at a test center, leave early enough to account for traffic or delays. Arriving on time without stress sets a strong tone for the rest of the day.

Your goal is simple. Protect your energy, maintain your composure, and give yourself the best possible foundation for a successful performance. The work has already been done. Test day is about showing up at your strongest.

Reach out to me with any questions about your GMAT prep. Happy studying!

1owwqpa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1owwqpa,Nitro V15 I have solved my dGPU through HDMI only dilemma.,"Since on the Nitro V15, the Integrated GPU handles all output to the internal display, and also any displays attached through the USB-C, we are forced to use an HDMI monitor to get better thermals and frame rates during gaming sessions. The external HDMI port is the only place where the NVIDIA GPU is hard-wired. 

This is fine while I'm at home and can plug into the docking station at my desk where I have a large HDMI monitor set up along with a mechanical keyboard and a gaming mouse. However, the big dilemma was how to handle this when I'm travelling and staying in a hotel? I have the 15.6 inch monitor, and so I bought a 15.6 inch portable monitor with both USB-C and micro-HDMI inputs. I plug in the monitor to the laptop, and use the rubber feet at the bottom to keep it in place against the monitor. I have the display configured to only display on the portable monitor. Same resolution. I lose a little of the refresh rate, as it's only 90Hz instead of 165, but the color accuracy is much better. 

I keep it tilted as in the picture to prevent heat build-up. You can see how I use the short cables to connect the monitor in one of the pictures.

This isn't for going to a coffee shop, taking it to class, or taking it to work. I'm not going to be gaming in those situations, and I only need to hook into the HDMI when gaming. When in those situations where I won't be gaming, I disable the Nvidia and rely on the integrated GPU as it is plenty fast enough for regular productivity and office apps. 

Of course, for video encoding/decoding you can still use the dGPU and allow the iGPU to display it to the screen, no big deal. But for gaming, the HDMI monitor makes a HUGE difference (HUGE is an acronym for Highest Ultra Gaming Experience. Yes, I just made that up. Don't use it, I'm going to trademark it.) No, I'm not going to trademark anything. Just feeling silly because I'm in a good mood. 

Why am I in a good mood? Because I've solved my dilemma with gaming on the road, that's why.",3,1763127547.0,AcerNitro,0,1.0,False

The Knot used Wayfair as the retailer (certified Keurig retailer). Well in October, my Keurig just stopped working! (The power will literally just not turn on. it is a duo, with a coffee pot and the k cup) so I reached out to Keurig and they said everything I have doesn’t count as proof of purchase (delivery slip, order confirmation etc) but it was PURCHASED FOR ME. I did not buy it, even the receipt my cousin got just says what they paid for, not the item itself. 

So because of this, I think tried to process through the knot, only to be told that wayfair no longer has the item and cannot replace it, that I should reach out to Keurig. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do? This is ridiculous to me, and honestly terrible customer service from Keurig!",1,1763127144.0,keurig,1,1.0,False
1owwkvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/newproductsamazon/comments/1owwkvu/is_a_puzzle_board_worth_buying_for_my_home/,Is a puzzle board worth buying for my home?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting really into jigsaw puzzles lately, and I wanted to share my experience with puzzle boards since a lot of people ask me if they're actually worth it.

**The short answer? Absolutely yes.**

Here's the thing - I used to do puzzles on my dining table, and it was a total nightmare. I'd have to move everything when dinner time came around, pieces would get lost, and my cat decided puzzle pieces were her new favorite toy to bat under the furniture.

A puzzle board changed everything for me. It's basically a flat surface, usually with a slight edge or border, that keeps all your puzzle pieces contained in one spot. Most of them are portable, so you can move your whole puzzle without messing it up.

**Why I think puzzle boards are worth the money:**

First off, you can actually use your table again. I know that sounds obvious, but seriously - being able to slide your puzzle under the couch or store it upright is a game changer. No more living around your half-finished 1000-piece landscape for three weeks.

Second, they protect your work. The raised edges keep pieces from sliding off, which is huge if you have pets or kids running around. Some boards even come with a cover or sorting trays attached.

Third, your back will thank you. A good puzzle board lets you work at a comfortable height instead of hunching over a coffee table like some kind of puzzle gremlin.

**What to look for:**

I'd recommend getting one that's the right size for the puzzles you typically do. Most standard boards fit 1000-1500 piece puzzles pretty well. Also, look for something with a smooth surface that won't damage your puzzle pieces.

If you're interested in checking some out, I found a solid selection here: https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board

The prices range quite a bit, so there's options whether you're casual about puzzles or seriously addicted like me.

**Are there downsides?**

Honestly, not really. The only ""con"" I can think of is that you need somewhere to store it, but even then, most puzzle boards are pretty thin and can slide next to a bookshelf or under a bed.

Some people say ""just use cardboard,"" and sure, you could. But a real puzzle board is sturdier, lasts forever, and actually makes the whole experience more enjoyable. It's one of those things where spending a little bit upfront saves you tons of frustration.

**Bottom line:**

If you do more than two or three puzzles a year, a puzzle board is 100% worth it. It makes puzzle time more relaxing and less stressful, which is kind of the whole point of doing puzzles in the first place.

You can browse different styles and prices here if you want to grab one: https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board

Anyone else have experience with these? What features do you look for in a good puzzle board? Would love to hear what's worked for you!",1,1763127139.0,newproductsamazon,0,1.0,False

Had expectations of some degree of countenance since I had keggled and worked out pre-op. Spent Wednesday sitting a puddle of pee with spirits dropping. The tip of my junk felt like it had been slammed in a car door and had no sensation of having to pee. Just a constantly filling series of diapers. I think it was like 10. Got up in the middle of the night and changed diaper.

Thursday morning had appt with pelvic floor therapist. Terrific young lady who knows her shit…and pee. She showed me how the things I was doing were pretty much wrong…and showed me what was right. We did the electrode bio feedback thing and I then understood. she also explained the trama that comes from having a catheter. Also set up the squeeze app for me. Things started to get a little better through the day. I was actually able to retain enough fluid for a couple small pees.

woke up this morning and realized that I had to pee and that I hadn’t done a diaper swap overnight. Hit the toilet and peeed like it was 1979! Plus the diaper was dry.

Moral of the story:

This is a process with many ups and downs. Your story and progress is different from everyone else. The body is healing. Set backs come with progress. On my second cup of coffee, and while there is a drip, I retained enough fluid to pee!

Thats a win!

I've been enjoying make/taking them. It allows me to collect my thoughts and feelings more being able to view it this way. I know that sounds stupid. It's been a fun way to disassociate from things. Besides, I'm having a gastritis flare so it's taking my mind off of that a little.

Without further ado...my Notes!


• Marciano confirming Demi was pushing the lie - This was such a stupid fucking storyline to try to keep Demi in the forefront when everyone started turning on her while trying to destroy her ""best friend's"" (at the time) marriage.

• Oof. Jessi and Layla were playing up those reactions for the cameras when they were talking to Mayci and Mikayla. I have a friend who can react like that when people are around; in a way that feels very performative. 

• I loved the faces Miranda made when they teased the Marciano stuff. I feel kind of bad that she is blatantly being left out of chats but I understand why. I wouldn't tell someone my business if I thought it could get back to someone that I have major problems with.

• The way everyone got excited that Taylor was back filled me with actual joy. I do love watching them truly support one another.

• The Producers like Zac, or are at least trying to paint him in a better light. DWTS sidelines shows that he still has work to put in.

• Demi showing up with Camille... If she was invited to the event, I can't really say much. It just really isn't a good look.

• Demi's hair looks like shit. I agree with everyone else.

• Demi acting like she did nothing wrong is baffling. Where Layla was a shitty friend in first 2 episodes, she is coming out swinging against Demi for Jessi here.

• Miranda's reaction to the Layla/Demi/Jessi drama in public was perfect.

• I missed Taylor's facial expressions and her ""real"" responses in the confessionals during the first 2 episodes. She's so messy; yet she's the one seeing things rationally with the ""Jessi wanting to see Marciano"" thing.

• During Jen and Zac's talk, I was insanely proud when Jen immediately called out Jessi's behavior regarding her marriage when Jessi had her own skeletons in her closet. It was an important thing for Jen to recognize.

• I agree with Taylor: Jessi and Marciano going to her room alone is not a good look when her marriage is on the rocks. Why couldn't they have this conversation in public? I'm sure there was a place for the two of them to sit and drink coffee or something without the girls there.

• Grown ass people relying on Lie Detector Tests to prove their innocence in a relationship confuses me. Are they so stunted in their growth that they...wait...yes, they are. Nevermind.

• Marciano's response to the lie detector question about Demi telling him to lie...hmm...

• I love that everyone dislikes that Jessi invited Marciano to dinner.

• So Jessi and Marciano made it to...what? 3rd Base? Most likely 3rd Base. Still fucked up to do with someone other than your partner.

O. Mikhevnina is a child and family psychologist who incorporates Socionics into her work. She has published a book that compiles personal accounts from individuals representing different sociotypes. The primary audience for the book is parents seeking a deeper understanding of their children, but it is also perfectly suited for our goal: to look at the world through the perspectives of different Socionics types.

**SEI's evolutory (or process-oriented) program Si is emotionally charged. It seeks out a variety of pleasant sensations.**

Below are quotes from SEIs about how much they enjoy nature, food, etc., and about the difficulties of waking up early.

**SEIs about Nature**

**Olga L**. “The state of happiness for me is music and, of course, nature.

I often experience a state of happiness. Right now, the blooming trees bring happiness, the scent of blooming lilacs is such a delight! The leaves on the trees move and play with light and shadow! That’s happiness. It’s an overwhelming sense of the beauty of the world! Indescribable! And harmony in everything! Nature is everything! All of nature is beautiful. 

Even in the north, it’s beautiful. You’d think, what’s there to see? But it’s stunningly beautiful: hills, white reindeer moss between huge moss-covered boulders, and bright red berries on it… An indescribable beauty. On the dark water, there’s pale ice, white on top, darker and darker underneath, with gentle sloping shores rising above the water... Happiness is the beauty of the world around us.”

**Irina V.**: “The feeling of harmony in life comes from nature: I love sunny landscapes, the sea, mountains, the purity and clarity of the air, the sounds of birds singing, the surf of the sea, the chirping of grasshoppers, and the nightingales’ song. All of this brings joy to the soul.”

**Elvira L.**: “I love nature in every sense, in every form. I strive to merge with it, periodically disconnecting from city life. I love the landscapes of nature, the sounds of nature, and whenever possible, I try to absorb nature with all my senses. 

When I was a child, I grew up surrounded by nature: our own house, garden, vegetable patch, a forest nearby, a river. I needed it all: swimming, sunbathing, rolling in the grass. I remember the smells of my childhood. Only near my house, my grandmother's old house, was there such a unique scent—nowhere else smells like that. Freshly cut grass, the scent coming from the river. It’s so wonderful.”

**Svetlana S.**: “About flowers. A daffodil is a purely cool-colored flower — it’s not mine, it’s just a flower. But a red peony, now that’s red — it radiates warmth, it’s pleasant. You want to just hug it, kiss it, and who knows what else — there’s a kind of rapture in the soul.

And lilacs — oh, I’d love to pick an armful of lilacs, bury my face in them, sink into them — I don’t even have the words. Pure delight! I also love primroses — I have all kinds: purple, red ones — it’s such a pleasure to look at them, pure joy.

Evenings at the country house are wonderful: the scent of night violets, the sun setting, the sky darkening, the forest standing off in the distance, and silence... nightingales singing — it’s such harmony, peace, nothing else is needed. You just want to live, and live, and live like that. I love walking barefoot on the ground.”

**Elena N. (1)**: “I love walking in the forest. In the forest, I dream. If there’s some pressing issue—about a meeting, about love—I create dialogues, imagine scenes. It’s a kind of communication.

I enjoy the silence in the forest, the general atmosphere. I go either for berries or mushrooms. I really enjoy picking mushrooms. I could walk through the forest endlessly: I go in in the morning and could wander until nightfall.”

**Anna M:** “I love reading fairy tales. In them, I immerse myself in a magical forest—so deep and mysterious.

I really love nature. I enjoy walking along snowy paths, where little lanterns glow in the blue spruces, and the snow is tinged brown. When I walk there, it feels like I'm in a fairy-tale dream. Any moment now, a little fox in a sarafan might step out from behind a tree. I really love the winter forest. I prefer winter. Summer is fast, dusty, noisy. But winter is calm—it’s a thick, flowing, magical state. 

I truly love winter. I find joy in snowflakes, the moon, and lights in the darkness. I don’t like sunny summer days, when the sun beats down, people are everywhere, and dust is in the air. I like the dark time of day—the night. I enjoy walking when it’s already dark and nothing can be seen. That’s what I like. And even indoors, I prefer when the curtains are drawn and the light is soft—that’s my atmosphere, I feel like a fish in water. When the sun is shining and the curtains are open—I don’t like bright light. I’d rather sit in the dark, in dim light, alone with myself—that's when I feel good. But under the sun I feel like I’ve been thrown onto the shore, or like I’m on a frying pan, when the light is glaring from everywhere—I really don’t enjoy that.”

**Svetlana S.**: “My morning mood varies. If it’s winter, the sun is shining, the sky is clear, and it’s frosty — then my mood is instantly good. I feel ready for action, I can get things done, make decisions. If I walk the dog in that kind of weather, I get so much enjoyment from it.

When I walk, I look at the sky, the trees, the snow. Especially in winter: the snow crunches underfoot, frost clings to the trees, and I think, “My God, this is eternity, this is everything, this is happiness — it’s simply amazing. And how much do people really need in life to be happy?””

**SEIs about Animals**

**Alexander N.**: “The world was alive to me. In the village, I could spend entire days watching the life of an anthill. I found it fascinating. But my parents and those around me, with their fears, didn’t allow me to explore the world like that — they placed limits on me.

I remember running with dogs. I had a wonderful relationship with the animal world. Dogs have this instinct to run — they move in massive packs, and I would run among them, even holding two big dogs by their lower jaws as I ran, and they ran alongside me. My parents saw this. Naturally, they panicked, projected their fears onto me, scolded me, spanked me, and implanted the idea that the dogs could bite me. The next day, a dog bit me. I started to fear dogs.

I really loved books about the animal world, about nature.

I really love cats. They are affectionate, gentle, cute, fluffy creatures, yet also strong-willed. They give me a sense of tenderness. What excites me is their ability to switch instantly from total relaxation to full alertness. A cat is lying there, melted like ice cream — then in a flash, it jumps onto the windowsill, and there it is again, lying like melted ice cream. I feel this, I let it pass through my body. I feel what the cat feels — when it stands and stretches, I start to stretch too. I sense the cat very deeply. When I pet it, I can feel when it enjoys it — and then suddenly, I feel the moment it stops enjoying it.”

**Elena N.**: “When I went to school and it was far from home, I would be surrounded by dogs—I would gather them along the way. They would all accompany me to school and back, and then walk me home. I used to collect all sorts of cats, feed them, feel sorry for them.”

**SEIs about Food**

**Elena N. (2)**: If I haven’t had a cup of brewed coffee in the morning, the day doesn’t work out. I don’t drink instant coffee – it smells disgusting, it makes me shudder…

Yes, in the mornings I have, you could say, a little ritual: a cup of coffee and a bun with butter and cheese. No other combination works. I tried to restrict myself – a bun with cheese but no butter, butter with cheese but no bun. No, it doesn’t work. It’s just not the same. There’s no wave of pleasure. But a cup of coffee and a bun with butter and cheese – that’s when I wake up, energy flows through my body, I feel strong, like I could run somewhere.

I always know exactly what taste I want. Right now, I want a pickled cucumber, and not just any kind – I know exactly the flavor. Not lightly salted, but with no vinegar, from a barrel… And right now, for example, I want an Olivier salad or some fried chicken.

When I was younger, I really liked the taste of rotisserie chicken. They made it only at one café, and I used to travel across the whole city (at least an hour one way) just to get a piece.”

**Elena N. (1)**: “SEI’s psychophysical state depends on how well they’ve slept and how well they’ve eaten. I used to not be able to function in the morning without a cup of coffee and a sandwich with butter and cheese. But even then, not right away—slowly, taking my time.

When I was in school, I had a ritual. I would set the table nicely for myself, place a book in front of me, and eat with pleasure. First course, second course, dessert, appetizer. Everything was in order, like in a restaurant, beautiful. I like mixed dishes, where there are many components.

On weekends, after my bath, my mother would sit me down at the table, in a scarf and pajamas, and serve me potatoes in milk—chopped potatoes soaked in milk. How could anyone eat that? It was awful! I never liked anything she cooked. But I loved everything my grandfather made. He would cook egg soup, semolina porridge.

SEI’s taste must be taken into account. If I don’t like something but am forced to eat it—I hate that. That fried onion floating in soup—I won’t eat it. Or when they chop up red onions into the dish—that’s awful!

I really liked and still like salads and dumplings. I didn’t eat mayonnaise until I was about fifteen. Everything was served to me separately, with sour cream. I didn’t like the smell of mayonnaise once, and that was it—I wouldn’t eat it. And then someone snuck it in, and I started eating mayonnaise.

Food must bring pleasure. I tried “herring under a fur coat” (a layered salad) when I was about twenty. I could eat a whole plate in one sitting.”

**Olga L.**: “I experience a great physical pleasure, a wave of delight through the whole body from having something tasty, sweet, and it must be beautifully presented. For example, I bought a little white pastry sprinkled with coconut, placed it on a dark plate, and ate it with a silver spoon. Oh, what a pleasure! The key is the dark plate with the silver spoon! Pure delight. The body relaxes, complete bliss. It's twice as delicious. You’ve got to savor it!”

**Anna M.**: “I’m not picky with food. I eat whatever I’m given. The only thing I don’t like at all is soup—any kind of soup. I eat everything else. I’m indifferent to sweets. I like salad and chicken. If a child doesn’t like or doesn’t want something to eat, don’t force them. If they get hungry, they’ll eat on their own. You, as adults, don’t eat what you don’t want—why should children be forced to? There’s never any benefit from food, no matter how healthy, if it’s eaten through force and with aversion.”

**Someone else about an SEI**: “Once, I was given a voucher to a sanatorium at work, so I went there to relax. My roommate turned out to be a smiling, pleasant-looking young woman who made a good impression. But she was a bit unlucky — on the second day, she sprained her leg and ended up stuck in the room. A day passed, and when I came back from my treatments, I found quite a scene: my roommate had a pained expression, looked all wound up... When I asked, ""What happened?"" she replied that she was feeling awful, her leg was driving her crazy, and if she didn’t get some ""walnut in chocolate"" candies, a good cup of coffee, and a cigarette of a specific brand right away, things would get much worse for her.

Her complaints seemed rather strange to me, but I literally ran to the store. They didn’t have those exact candies, so I bought a different kind. I rushed back — and there she was, already sitting by the door waiting. She saw the candies I brought and said, ""I don’t want these!"" But she drank the coffee with trembling hands. Thankfully, the store had the exact cigarettes she needed.

Twenty minutes later, she was a different person — smiling, kind, calm... ""You saved me,"" she told me. At the time, of course, I had no idea what had just happened.”

**Irina V.**: “It’s important not to overfeed such a child but to teach them what food is healthy and what is harmful. It’s important to explain what is beneficial from the perspective of aesthetics and a slim figure. Without restricting them from proper nutrition, and without battles or pressure, it's necessary to limit sweets and fatty foods. 

From an early age, I dreamed of being delicate, like a princess in fairy tales, and I always envied the skinny girls who had no appetite. I never lacked an appetite. My mom and grandmother were excellent cooks and never restricted me in anything, so I was quite a chubby child. Often, before falling asleep, I would dream of gorging myself on cream-filled pastries.”

**Alexander N.**: “A child shouldn't be forced to eat. I experienced that as very painful, and later developed a painful attachment to food, an addiction — a junkie-like dependence on the taste of food. How do people become addicts? First they’re injected with drugs by force, and then they can’t live without it. It’s the same with food. As a child, I often felt fine without eating. Two apples a day were more than enough. I got a lot of energy from the taste of an apple. I’d munch on a walnut — and that was enough. But if you’re addicted to the pleasure of taste — then it’s a kilogram at a time, stuffing yourself, gaining weight.”

**SEIs about Bodily Sensations**

**Svetlana S.**: “The body needs to move, to feel alive. Back when I was younger, I would go to the bathhouse. My mother would come and ask, “Are you still alive in there?” But I needed time: to slowly toss more steam, sweat, scrub, breathe. Everything should be done unhurriedly, to enjoy it. Prepare the little birch broom so it gives off a scent, wash slowly. When you enter the steam room — a shiver runs through you, a kind of chill, and then you warm up, heat up, and it’s warm, peaceful, wonderful.”

**Someone else about an SEI**: “I have a brother of this type. When we were growing up, I couldn’t understand his ""quirks."" We lived in a private house with a sauna, but my brother didn’t like bathing in it. Instead, he would travel across the city to our aunt’s place to take a bath. I remember our grandmother packing a huge, soft, and plush towel for him, along with shampoo—each time a different one—a special slightly coarse washcloth, and fragrant soap. This routine happened every week, and my brother never grew tired of it. I couldn’t understand why he went through so much trouble when he could simply bathe at home. Now it’s clear: for him, pleasures have to be refined and exquisite, bringing a sense of relaxation and bliss throughout his body.”

**Anna M.**: “Freedom is important—freedom of choice in everything, even in something like what to wear. Sometimes parents say, “But you’ll be cold in that!” But someone like me knows very well what will make me cold and what won’t. When I dressed the way my mom told me to, I was always too hot. But when I dress the way I feel is right, I’ve never gotten sick from being cold. I always know how I need to dress for the weather. You don’t need to fear that a child will freeze to death if they choose their own clothes. I would always end up sweating when I wore what my mom picked out. She feels temperature differently.”

**Alexander N.**: “Parents pass their fears on to their children. You could say parents take revenge on their children for their own fears. “How come the child isn't afraid, but I am? Well, let me make him afraid too.”

A child runs barefoot in -30°C? Ah! That’s it! The parents have a heart attack. But a child needs to reach many understandings on their own, with their own awareness. A child should come to many realizations in life independently.

Parents should try to keep their own worldview to themselves, and let the child develop their own — that way, it will be less distorted. The child will perceive, feel, and understand reality as it truly is, not through a set of lenses and masks.

Overprotectiveness is very dangerous: “Wear this, eat that.” Care and support should be within reasonable bounds. A child should be given choices: “Will you wear this or that?” In my case, everything was strict. Strict programs were instilled — programs for illness. If my parents said, “Put on your hat or you’ll catch a cold,” it was imprinted, and I would end up freezing, getting sick, catching colds. In early childhood, I had a sense of freedom — I could run here, or I could go there. It was wonderful. I could do something or not do it. Then they shut me down. It had to be only the way the parents allowed. Only that way and no other. It felt painful — like the murder of my inner world.”

**Irina V.**: “Destructive sounds and smells cause uncomfortable feelings — the heartbeat may quicken, aggression may arise, along with a desire to make them stop.”

**SEIs about Physical Contact**

**Elena N. (2)**: “When I’m next to a comfortable person, it’s like lying in a feather bed – warmth spreads through my whole body.”

**Anna M:** “It’s very important to hold such a child in your arms, to stroke their head, hug them, say kind words, kiss their cheeks, hold their hands, and embrace them. 

I love close physical contact—not having someone sit far away, but sitting close, hugging, and talking. Circular energy exchanges really fill me up, so when having an open conversation, it’s better not to sit opposite each other but to lie down on the couch, hug, and make the other person feel comfortable and protected. A sense of security arises during close physical interactions.”

**SEIs about Living Space**

**Olga L.**: “Comfort and coziness are my thing; it's a complete state of inner harmony. When there's no comfort and coziness, my soul feels unsettled—I get jittery and nervous. Even if it's just one square meter that resonates with harmony—I'm at peace within it. Without it, I can literally get physically ill; no coziness, no harmony.”

**Someone else about an SEI**: ""Every year, I rent an apartment for the entire summer in a small resort town. And every year, a good friend of mine comes to visit me while I'm on vacation. I remember her first visit. She didn’t like the bed I offered her in the next room. Leaving her to think it over, I went out for a while to take care of some things. When I returned, she was gone. I searched the whole apartment — empty. But I knew she must be asleep already. And then I found her on the balcony. She had stacked several mattresses on top of each other and made herself a soft little nest in the corner of the balcony. She’d hung a light, airy curtain over the window, opened the large window pane, and was sleeping on her cozy bed, gently cooled by the fresh breeze. Next to her bed stood a little vase with chocolate-covered marshmallows and a book — she’d been reading. In short, a perfect little nest. It must have been a hundred percent pleasure for her.”

**SEIs about Going to Bed and Getting Up**

**Elena N. (1)**: “In the evenings, I feel a surge of energy and the desire to do something—parents need to know that. They need to understand that mood and physical well-being are strongly influenced by whether a child gets enough sleep, and even by how they wake up. 

If I get up abruptly—forget it, I’m completely out of it. In the morning, my alarm goes off every minute. It rings, and I turn to one side; then I lie on the other side for a bit and fall back asleep. The alarm rings again, I lie on my back a bit, it rings again—and then I get up. 

My mood and productivity really depend on how well I’ve slept, how much I’ve lingered in bed, stretched. If I get up at nine in the morning, I’ll feel fine even if I went to bed at six. But if I went to bed at nine in the evening and got up at six, having slept three times longer—I’ll still feel awful.”

**Anna M.**: “You shouldn’t force a child to go to bed. They know themselves when they’re tired. Maybe they don’t want to sleep at nine, maybe at twelve—that’s what their body tells them. You can’t fool the body! It’s hard for a child like this to fit into a strict schedule. I don’t like routines.”

**Elvira L.**: “One memory from my childhood (around age seven to nine) that stands out is how I used to wake up in the mornings. My mom always woke me up gently: she would first come into the room and turn on a soft light from the desk lamp, sit down on my bed, kiss me, and say something quietly. Sometimes she would come in more than once until I was fully awake. 

My dad, on the other hand, would burst in noisily, flip on the brightest light from the ceiling lamp, and shout something like, “Wake up! How long are you going to sleep?!” Sometimes he would even pull the blanket off me. It was extremely unpleasant. To this day, I still hate the Russian national anthem, which my dad used to blast on the radio at six in the morning to wake me up.

A SEI child should be woken up gradually, under no circumstances irritating their senses with bright lights, loud sounds, or similar things.”

**Elena N. (2)**: “I wake up very hard in the morning. For me, it’s better not to go to bed at all than to have to get up. I just want to lie there. I need five to ten minutes lying on one side, then five minutes on the other.

But I have to get up! It weighs on me, and I haven’t even lain on the other side yet – it’s gone numb, and I didn’t lie on it! And I want to. So yes, it's terribly hard for me to get up.”

long story short, i finally asked for help and got diagnosed with depression 

this happened around a month ago

now i just wanna say if you’re going through the same thing ask for help

This is the first real step for change 

im not saying that my life now is sunshine and rainbows but im not blindly tumbling through life and at least i have a name for the feeling i had for years now

my tip for anyone going through the same thing is have a routine; not necessarily a rigid one but one that includes studying, having fun, spiritual activities, etc etc

For example I start my day earlier now at fajr time and then have my coffee with sudoku

Its a ritual that makes me feel grounded and real (depersonalization kicked my ass the past few years)

also..if someone relates to this..when does it get better? Like how long does it take for the meds to kick in? And are there other things i can do to catalyze the process of healing?",1,1763126220.0,No_Zero_Days,0,1.0,False

I am a 57 year old man from California who is looking for someone, a unique someone, a woman, who is smart and kind and with a touch of humor and sarcasm, fun to spend time with and true to herself and those around her. Introvert like me is cool but not a deal breaker, She enjoys a night in on the couch and a movie, cares about her health and cares for those around her enjoys humor, kitchen dancing and just enjoying the downtime together, after a long working day, we come home to the person that is our home and just enjoy those moments together. Yeah I might be a bit of a sap too. 

Interests on my end are varied yet simple, I enjoy travel, mostly roadtrips, cooking and photography, writing and music, films, reading and coffee, can be found on a nice day off at the beach with my feet in the sand and just enjoying the waves. I am 420 friendly but edibles only as I don’t smoke and rarely drink, aside from the occasional single malt. I am a jeans and t-shirt guy, with a casual, laid back style who enjoys a good day at a street fair or just roaming thrift stores or a great garage sale (I always follow those homemade signs and pull over to check it out).. Bonus points for sense of humor and especially fans of puns and Dad jokes, transparency is a big thing with me. 

Oh and as far as music goes.. Music with me is scattered and eclectic, I like classic rock, alternative, jazz, R&B, pop, you name it, I can go from AC/DC to Rush, The Who, Stones to Joy Division/New Order, to Miles Davis and Yellowjackets, to Beethoven and Mozart to Sanborn, Zevon, DCFC/Postal, Clean Bandit, Jess Glynn, Gran Bel Fisher, Rafferty, Genesis, Shins, Cake, Killers, Coldplay, Winwood, Segar, Madness, Dead Milkmen, and I could probably go on but I think you get the idea lol.. Its harder for films as I have way too many favorite movies and TV is scattered too but as a short example list, Firefly, Eureka, Anything Sorkin, good drama, or comedy.. not much of a horror fan but enjoy a good mystery with a horror angle.. Again, a long list :-)

Singing in the car is a must (yeah I am that whackadoodle you saw at the traffic light doing the car karaoke 🤣) and carrying a tune is not mandatory but would be cool if one of us in the car could carry one 😜 what is mandatory is my taking your hand and spontaneous dancing in the kitchen or elsewhere.

Someone to connect with and continue to grow with, let’s chat and see how we vibe and take things from there, naturally and organically and see what develops. 

Location is not a factor but must be USA/Canada based NO exceptions, age is not a factor, It’s all about who you are as a person, and how we mesh together that matters most to me. So your age doesn’t matter, But, I do tend to connect better with those younger than me.. 

Your reply should tell me about you with age and location and your interests, Those with a picture attached gets mine in reply, and Physical attraction is important, and I prefer to get this part over with early on.

1oww24j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oww24j/warning_check_your_backseat/,Warning: Check Your Backseat,"“Warning: check your backseat.”

I wasn’t worried about the message when it first popped up. It’s one of those things they put in these days to make sure no one leaves a child in a hot car, I guess. It hadn’t ever shown me that warning before, but I figured maybe a passenger had left a purse on the floor or something and it was detecting the weight.

There wasn’t anything there, though. I looked under the seats and everything, even ran my hands along the back edge to see if there was a wallet or phone stuck in the crack. I didn’t think that sort of thing would set off the alarm, but the car was still fairly new, so I couldn’t be sure. Regardless, nothing was there.

I’d forgotten about it by the end of the next day, honestly. But when I pulled into my driveway and turned off the car, there it was again on my dashboard.

I checked the backseat again. Still nothing. I hadn’t had any messages from passengers looking for any lost items, either.

Maybe this was just a thing the car did? Just a general warning to remind drivers to check the backseat every time they got out. If so, it felt counterproductive. If the warning was there every time, people were bound to start ignoring it. It would just become part of the background.

Also I was sure that the car hadn’t been doing this for the first several months I’d had it. On the other hand, this was the sort of change they might have pushed through a software update. There could have been some new legislation, some lobbying group pushing to have this warning on permanently like the meaningless parental advisory stickers on music.

I looked online that night, searching through car forums and news posts for any mention of this warning. I couldn’t find any indication that it was supposed to be happening every time I turned the car off. In fact, it didn’t seem to be showing up for anyone else. This problem was only in my car.

Clearly it was just a bad sensor. It was probably still under warranty, but in order to get it fixed I’d still have to leave it at the dealership for a day, and the warranty wasn’t going to pay my lost income for the day off. I told myself I could just ignore it. It was just a single line of text. I’d stop noticing it in no time.

I was wrong. Every time I turned the car off, that message glared at me like a dire omen. I found myself obsessively checking the backseat every time I got out, even though I knew I’d find nothing. I vacuumed the car until not so much as a crumb remained. I checked the seatbelt latches. Everything was perfect, but the warning still appeared.

I tried ignoring it. I averted my eyes when I turned the car off, but I could feel it glowing from the deactivated dash, see the phantom words printed across the darkness of my eyelids. I walked away from the car without looking in the back, telling myself that it was a waste of time and there was nothing to find. I knew I was right, of course, but I found myself wide awake at three in the morning staring at the ceiling and thinking: *what if?* I ended up kneeling in the street, in my pajamas, with my phone flashlight on, looking under the seats for something I knew wouldn’t be there. The backseat was as empty as always.

The warning haunted me constantly. I only saw it when I stopped the car, but I knew it was always coming. I began to watch the backseat constantly, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror more than was safe or reasonable. My passengers noticed. My rating began to dip, with notes marking concerns about attentiveness to the road. My tips suffered as well.

Finally I bit the bullet and took the car in to get the sensor fixed. The warning mocked me as I parked it in the lot, daring me to go inside without looking. I wanted to. I knew there was nothing there. But if I claimed there was a sensor issue and they found a bag or a box or some other physical object sitting back there, I’d look like I was too dumb to have just checked the backseat. I knew I had checked it. I had checked it a thousand times. But I looked once more just to be sure.

I explained my problem to the man at the counter. He typed some notes into his computer and said, “Gonna be a few hours until we can get you in.”

“That’s fine,” I said. “I’ll wait.”

“You sure you don’t hav—” he began. I cut him off more emphatically than I intended.

“There is NOTHING in the backseat. I have LOOKED.”

“All right, all right,” he said, raising his hands to placate me. “Just trying to save you some time in case.”

I went to look again after that. I really couldn’t have stood being wrong at that point.

It was empty. It was always empty. I knew every crevice of that backseat now. There was nothing there.

I sat in the waiting room drinking coffee and playing on my phone. I was inexplicably nervous. I couldn’t figure out why. It was just a sensor issue. They would find it and fix it. The problem would go away. It was crazy that I’d waited this long, that I’d let it get to me this much.

Finally they called me back up to the front.

“Well, we can’t find anything wrong with your car,” the mechanic said.

“What do you mean? There’s absolutely nothing in the backseat. I have made very sure of that!”

“Backseat’s clean as a whistle, sure. But we can’t get that warning to turn on, either, not without someone in the backseat. It cuts on like it’s supposed to with a person back there, but if it’s just the driver, it doesn’t show.”

My expression must have been somewhere between disbelief and rage. The mechanic took a step back. “Look, I’ll come show you.”

I calmed myself and followed him out to the garage. He turned on the car while I watched through the window. He let it run for a moment, then turned it off. No message appeared.

“See?” he said. “We can replace the part if you want, but since we can’t find an issue it’s not going to be covered under warranty. And we’ve got to take the entire back seat out to do it, so there’s gonna be a decent labor fee.”

I ignored him and got into the car. I turned it on and then, with trepidation, turned it back off. For the first time in weeks, no warning appeared.

The rush of relief I felt was incredible. I turned the car on and off again several more times. There was no message. The warning was gone.

“You happy?” the mechanic asked.

“Unbelievably,” I said.

He shrugged. “Wish they were all this easy.”

I drove home feeling like I was floating. I hadn’t realized how much tension I had been carrying, or how much my car had begun to feel like a prison. The road was broad and open. The day was beautiful. I was free.

In my peripheral vision, a light flickered. Something on the passenger side of the car had blinked out, a little orange light I could not remember ever having paid attention to before. I stared sharply at it now, trying to figure out what had been illuminated.

It blinked briefly again, on just long enough for me to read it: PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF. It stayed on whenever there was no one in the front passenger seat.

It was off now.

The final short blink could have been anything. It could have been an LED failing. A sensor breaking. Any of a thousand electrical glitches.

Or it could have been something settling itself into the passenger seat.

I pulled over to the side of the road. I left the car running when I got out. I did not look back as I walked away. There was no point. I knew there was nothing in the backseat anymore.

I never went back for the car. The police called a few days later. They’d found my vehicle, they said. Some kids had taken it out joyriding. It was in bad shape. So were the kids. They were reviewing the dashcam footage, but did I want a copy for my insurance?

I shouldn’t have watched it. I knew that before I ever put the thumbdrive in my computer. But I had to know.

They were laughing at first, whooping and hollering as they sped away down the street. All clearly having fun at first. Pretty soon, though, one of them starts cautioning the driver to slow down. The panic starts then. Screaming that the pedals won’t work, the wheel won’t turn, the doors won’t open. All the while, the speed on the display is creeping higher and higher.

It ends as you’d expect. I’m sure there’ll be questions about why I left my car with the keys in it, whether I knew something was wrong. I suppose the clean bill of health I got from the dealership that day will be useful in proving my innocence.

I’m not worried about that right now, though. My Ring doorbell is notifying me that there’s someone on my front porch.

1oww1bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites/comments/1oww1bb/warning_check_your_backseat/,Warning: Check Your Backseat,"“Warning: check your backseat.”

I wasn’t worried about the message when it first popped up. It’s one of those things they put in these days to make sure no one leaves a child in a hot car, I guess. It hadn’t ever shown me that warning before, but I figured maybe a passenger had left a purse on the floor or something and it was detecting the weight.

There wasn’t anything there, though. I looked under the seats and everything, even ran my hands along the back edge to see if there was a wallet or phone stuck in the crack. I didn’t think that sort of thing would set off the alarm, but the car was still fairly new, so I couldn’t be sure. Regardless, nothing was there.

I’d forgotten about it by the end of the next day, honestly. But when I pulled into my driveway and turned off the car, there it was again on my dashboard.

I checked the backseat again. Still nothing. I hadn’t had any messages from passengers looking for any lost items, either.

Maybe this was just a thing the car did? Just a general warning to remind drivers to check the backseat every time they got out. If so, it felt counterproductive. If the warning was there every time, people were bound to start ignoring it. It would just become part of the background.

Also I was sure that the car hadn’t been doing this for the first several months I’d had it. On the other hand, this was the sort of change they might have pushed through a software update. There could have been some new legislation, some lobbying group pushing to have this warning on permanently like the meaningless parental advisory stickers on music.

I looked online that night, searching through car forums and news posts for any mention of this warning. I couldn’t find any indication that it was supposed to be happening every time I turned the car off. In fact, it didn’t seem to be showing up for anyone else. This problem was only in my car.

Clearly it was just a bad sensor. It was probably still under warranty, but in order to get it fixed I’d still have to leave it at the dealership for a day, and the warranty wasn’t going to pay my lost income for the day off. I told myself I could just ignore it. It was just a single line of text. I’d stop noticing it in no time.

I was wrong. Every time I turned the car off, that message glared at me like a dire omen. I found myself obsessively checking the backseat every time I got out, even though I knew I’d find nothing. I vacuumed the car until not so much as a crumb remained. I checked the seatbelt latches. Everything was perfect, but the warning still appeared.

I tried ignoring it. I averted my eyes when I turned the car off, but I could feel it glowing from the deactivated dash, see the phantom words printed across the darkness of my eyelids. I walked away from the car without looking in the back, telling myself that it was a waste of time and there was nothing to find. I knew I was right, of course, but I found myself wide awake at three in the morning staring at the ceiling and thinking: *what if?* I ended up kneeling in the street, in my pajamas, with my phone flashlight on, looking under the seats for something I knew wouldn’t be there. The backseat was as empty as always.

The warning haunted me constantly. I only saw it when I stopped the car, but I knew it was always coming. I began to watch the backseat constantly, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror more than was safe or reasonable. My passengers noticed. My rating began to dip, with notes marking concerns about attentiveness to the road. My tips suffered as well.

Finally I bit the bullet and took the car in to get the sensor fixed. The warning mocked me as I parked it in the lot, daring me to go inside without looking. I wanted to. I knew there was nothing there. But if I claimed there was a sensor issue and they found a bag or a box or some other physical object sitting back there, I’d look like I was too dumb to have just checked the backseat. I knew I had checked it. I had checked it a thousand times. But I looked once more just to be sure.

I explained my problem to the man at the counter. He typed some notes into his computer and said, “Gonna be a few hours until we can get you in.”

“That’s fine,” I said. “I’ll wait.”

“You sure you don’t hav—” he began. I cut him off more emphatically than I intended.

“There is NOTHING in the backseat. I have LOOKED.”

“All right, all right,” he said, raising his hands to placate me. “Just trying to save you some time in case.”

I went to look again after that. I really couldn’t have stood being wrong at that point.

It was empty. It was always empty. I knew every crevice of that backseat now. There was nothing there.

I sat in the waiting room drinking coffee and playing on my phone. I was inexplicably nervous. I couldn’t figure out why. It was just a sensor issue. They would find it and fix it. The problem would go away. It was crazy that I’d waited this long, that I’d let it get to me this much.

Finally they called me back up to the front.

“Well, we can’t find anything wrong with your car,” the mechanic said.

“What do you mean? There’s absolutely nothing in the backseat. I have made very sure of that!”

“Backseat’s clean as a whistle, sure. But we can’t get that warning to turn on, either, not without someone in the backseat. It cuts on like it’s supposed to with a person back there, but if it’s just the driver, it doesn’t show.”

My expression must have been somewhere between disbelief and rage. The mechanic took a step back. “Look, I’ll come show you.”

I calmed myself and followed him out to the garage. He turned on the car while I watched through the window. He let it run for a moment, then turned it off. No message appeared.

“See?” he said. “We can replace the part if you want, but since we can’t find an issue it’s not going to be covered under warranty. And we’ve got to take the entire back seat out to do it, so there’s gonna be a decent labor fee.”

I ignored him and got into the car. I turned it on and then, with trepidation, turned it back off. For the first time in weeks, no warning appeared.

The rush of relief I felt was incredible. I turned the car on and off again several more times. There was no message. The warning was gone.

“You happy?” the mechanic asked.

“Unbelievably,” I said.

He shrugged. “Wish they were all this easy.”

I drove home feeling like I was floating. I hadn’t realized how much tension I had been carrying, or how much my car had begun to feel like a prison. The road was broad and open. The day was beautiful. I was free.

In my peripheral vision, a light flickered. Something on the passenger side of the car had blinked out, a little orange light I could not remember ever having paid attention to before. I stared sharply at it now, trying to figure out what had been illuminated.

It blinked briefly again, on just long enough for me to read it: PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF. It stayed on whenever there was no one in the front passenger seat.

It was off now.

The final short blink could have been anything. It could have been an LED failing. A sensor breaking. Any of a thousand electrical glitches.

Or it could have been something settling itself into the passenger seat.

I pulled over to the side of the road. I left the car running when I got out. I did not look back as I walked away. There was no point. I knew there was nothing in the backseat anymore.

I never went back for the car. The police called a few days later. They’d found my vehicle, they said. Some kids had taken it out joyriding. It was in bad shape. So were the kids. They were reviewing the dashcam footage, but did I want a copy for my insurance?

I shouldn’t have watched it. I knew that before I ever put the thumbdrive in my computer. But I had to know.

They were laughing at first, whooping and hollering as they sped away down the street. All clearly having fun at first. Pretty soon, though, one of them starts cautioning the driver to slow down. The panic starts then. Screaming that the pedals won’t work, the wheel won’t turn, the doors won’t open. All the while, the speed on the display is creeping higher and higher.

It ends as you’d expect. I’m sure there’ll be questions about why I left my car with the keys in it, whether I knew something was wrong. I suppose the clean bill of health I got from the dealership that day will be useful in proving my innocence.

I’m not worried about that right now, though. My Ring doorbell is notifying me that there’s someone on my front porch.

Here’s the simplest breakdown that helped me (and a lot of others) finally start seeing progress:

1. You’re not eating enough protein
Protein keeps you full and prevents muscle loss.
Aim for 25–30g per meal — it makes a big difference.

2. You’re drinking your calories
Juice, iced coffee, energy drinks… even “healthy” ones.
These ruin your deficit without you noticing.

3. You move way less than you think
Most people walk 2–3k steps max.
If you can get to 8–10k steps, fat loss gets WAY easier.

Bonus tip:
You don’t need a gym, crazy workouts, or starving yourself.
A good routine + consistent steps + high protein = results.

1owvqnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/djerfavenue/comments/1owvqnp/djerf_avenue_continues_its_quiet_comeback_after/,Djerf Avenue Continues Its Quiet Comeback After Workplace Controversy,"From the article:

Almost a year after accusations of workplace bullying, toxicity, and favoritism rocked Djerf Avenue—once, one of the Internet's most beloved labels—[Matilda Djerf](https://www.lofficielusa.com/fashion/matilda-djerf-djerf-avenue-new-york-city-pop-up-fashion-show), the brand's founder, is slowly bringing herself and the label back into the spotlight. 

In September 2025, Djerf Avenue hosted a pop-up shop in [New York City](https://www.lofficielusa.com/pop-culture/spring-summer-parties-events-nyc-2025), followed by an event in Stockholm, and most recently, a stop at Selfridge's in [London](https://www.lofficielusa.com/travel-living/best-london-coffee-shops-to-visit), where it is slated to take over space in the store until the end of January 2026. Djerf Avenue's pop-ups and events once had fans lined up as far as the eye could see. These days, it's a reduced but dedicated number of Djerf superfans that continue to show up to in-person events, but on TikTok, the brand is slowly but surely regaining its clout—partially due to the perennial viral popularity of the plush fruit-patterned robe—which suggests a true comeback may be in the works. 

Shortly after news of the accusations broke, Djerf came out with a statement on Instagram and apologized. 

“To anyone who I’ve hurt or let down, I want to start by saying that I’m genuinely sorry. When I started Djerf Avenue I never expected that the company would be what it is today, with so many team members and so much responsibility,"" she wrote. ""I wasn’t ready. I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company, and under a lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety, I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. And for that I am so, so sorry. I wish my growth happened faster. I really want to underline that I’m extremely committed to getting it right and continuing growing.”

As many fans noted, Djerf did not deny the allegations and has shifted her responsibilities at the brand to attempt to promote a more positive environment for Djerf Avenue employees.

“While I don’t manage internal teams directly, I work closely with key functions to guide and inspire creative decisions – from partnerships and product concepts to the look and feel of our larger brand moments,” Djerf told [*Vogue Scandinavia*](https://www.voguescandinavia.com/articles/matilda-djerf-djerf-avenue-next-chapter) earlier this fall.

As Djerf rebuilds after last year's controversy, the brand itself appears to be making a comeback, and Djerf continues to do what her brand is best known for—engaging her community and inviting fans into the ultra-chic, highly coveted world of Djerf.

1owvq5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Simple-Spinach-3967/comments/1owvq5g/the_corporate_hotel_kolkata_blending_comfort_and/,The Corporate Hotel Kolkata: Blending Comfort and Professional Excellence,"Kolkata, known as the “City of Joy,” beautifully merges its colonial charm with modern-day sophistication. For business travelers, this balance is especially evident in the growing hospitality sector, where [**the corporate hotel Kolkata**](https://hotelkzarcorporate.com/) options stand out as a blend of luxury, comfort, and professional functionality. These hotels are designed not just for leisure but for those who seek efficiency, connectivity, and class during their work trips.

# A Hub for Business Travelers

Corporate hotels in Kolkata have evolved to meet the dynamic needs of the business community. With the city’s expanding IT parks, financial institutions, and multinational offices, the demand for business-oriented accommodation has surged. These hotels are strategically located near commercial hubs such as Salt Lake’s Sector V, Park Street, Esplanade, and the Airport Road area, allowing travelers easy access to corporate offices, convention centers, and transport facilities.

Whether it’s a short-term meeting or an extended corporate stay, these hotels provide tailored services to ensure maximum convenience. From high-speed Wi-Fi and business lounges to flexible meeting spaces, every facility is designed to enhance productivity and comfort.

# Modern Amenities for Seamless Stays

A defining trait of any good corporate hotel is its focus on technology and efficiency. The rooms are equipped with smart workstations, ergonomic chairs, and digital controls for lighting and temperature. High-speed internet connectivity ensures guests can conduct video conferences or work remotely without interruption.

Many corporate hotels also feature dedicated business centers offering services such as printing, scanning, courier handling, and secretarial assistance. For international travelers, multi-cuisine restaurants and 24-hour room service provide the flexibility needed for different time zones. Fitness centers, spa facilities, and rooftop lounges often complement the stay, offering a balance between work and relaxation.

# Conference and Meeting Facilities

The strength of corporate hotels in Kolkata lies in their event infrastructure. They offer well-equipped conference rooms and banquet halls ideal for seminars, workshops, board meetings, and product launches. These spaces come with modern audiovisual systems, projectors, soundproof interiors, and customizable seating arrangements.

Event planning teams are available to assist with everything from technical setup to catering, ensuring a smooth experience for corporate clients. Some hotels even provide hybrid meeting setups — blending physical and virtual participation — a feature that has become crucial in the post-pandemic business world.

# Culinary Excellence for Professionals on the Move

Food plays an important role in hospitality, and corporate hotels in Kolkata understand this well. Their in-house restaurants offer diverse menus that cater to global tastes while retaining the essence of Kolkata’s local cuisine. Buffets, express business lunches, and curated dinner menus allow guests to enjoy a fine dining experience even during tight schedules.

Coffee shops and executive lounges provide an ideal environment for informal meetings or quick breaks between sessions. The culinary services are often available round-the-clock, catering to early check-ins, late arrivals, or extended work hours.

# Convenient Location and Connectivity

Kolkata’s corporate hotels are strategically located near important transport links, such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, Howrah Station, and major metro routes. This makes them ideal for travelers flying in for short-term business trips or interstate conferences.

For professionals looking to explore the city after work, popular destinations like Victoria Memorial, Eco Park, and Park Street are within easy reach. Proximity to shopping centers, cultural spots, and fine-dining restaurants ensures guests can blend business with leisure seamlessly.

# Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility

Modern travelers increasingly value eco-consciousness, and many corporate hotels in Kolkata have embraced sustainable practices. Initiatives like energy-efficient lighting, waste management, and green housekeeping systems are now standard in several properties. Some hotels even integrate corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, allowing guests and companies to contribute to local causes during their stay.

This focus on sustainability not only benefits the environment but also aligns with the values of today’s businesses, which often prefer to associate with eco-friendly brands.

# Safety and Hygiene Standards

Post-pandemic, hygiene and safety have become top priorities for corporate travelers. Business hotels have responded with stringent sanitization protocols, contactless check-ins, and digital payment systems. Regular cleaning schedules, air-purification systems, and well-trained staff ensure guests enjoy a safe and comfortable environment throughout their stay.

Additionally, 24/7 security and surveillance systems enhance the overall sense of safety, which is crucial for professionals traveling with valuable equipment or confidential documents.

# Conclusion

In the heart of Kolkata’s dynamic business landscape, corporate hotels play a pivotal role in redefining hospitality. They are more than just places to stay — they are environments designed to foster efficiency, comfort, and connection. Combining state-of-the-art amenities with warm Bengali hospitality, these hotels offer the perfect setting for business travelers who wish to experience the city’s vibrancy without compromising on professionalism.

Whether attending a corporate meeting, organizing an event, or working remotely, guests will find that the city’s business hotels truly understand what it means to balance productivity and relaxation. Kolkata, with its growing corporate culture and hospitality excellence, continues to prove that business and pleasure can indeed coexist harmoniously.",1,1763124887.0,u_Simple-Spinach-3967,0,1.0,False

1owvmcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/WesBentley/comments/1owvmcs/the_same_man_in_many_worlds_wes_bentley_and_the/,[The Same Man in Many Worlds] Wes Bentley and the French New Wave. A Thought Experiment in Several Parts. Part 1: Luc Moullet,"Hello, Friday, here we come. Hope you’ve resurfaced out of the work week unscathed. I wanted to make you happy with a curated Wes Bentley fall vibes playlist, and… it started snowing. Not that snowing in the middle of November is unexpected here – rather the opposite. It’s perfectly normal and an actual part of the change of seasons. Starbucks turns Christmas Red right after Halloween, after all! And it totally messes up the intent, both for my coffees (pecan crunch lattes are gone like the spring lavender cold foam ones before them) and the playlist. Now I need to throw in something chilly, maybe from *American Horror Story: Hotel*. You know the band She Wants Revenge?

Alright, alright, let’s get back to the topic.

French New Wave.

The idea started with him finally talking. After *Yellowstone* and before the *Shards* cast was announced, Wes Bentley gave an interview. He spoke about how it felt to play Jamie Dutton (forty shades of grief) and how fun it could be to star in a movie that’s a bit more cheerful. I took it seriously – I always take his words seriously – and thought, why don’t we give our guy something lighter on the emotional load and see how he performs there? In our heads, at least. Think how he would like it in the streets of Paris or on Brittany’s rugged coastline, and how he would go along with the whole cast of *Cahiers du Cinema* critics.

And that’s how this thought experiment was born.

The first take was a figure of Godard at his table, typing vigorously something like, “An American face is already an advertisement!” I had to cut it there and set the film aside gently, like placing a kitten into a box. (Spoiler: it would escape the box, eventually, and make its way into another part of this series.) The second take leaned into Éric Rohmer’s conversations. Sunshine and waves inhabited his frames and could be considered uplifting – which is exactly what we need. He worked with actors a lot, relying heavily on improvisation, which is maybe not the right way. Not the Wes way, who, as far as I remember, prefers clear directing.

Then there were Chabrol and Truffaut, side by side. That’s a hit, I thought. Truffaut would have liked him best. Chabrol would have used him most. More on that later.

And then there was Luc Moullet.

Deliciously quirky, fast-paced, brimming with dry humor and social commentary in a Monty Python way (which I know Wes likes\*), urging his actors to frown in a way that’s absurd and move like they know we’re watching. Looking into the camera, even. We’d see Wes eating with his hands, charging through a protest sign and ripping it in two, being nice with his neighbors, being mean with his roommates, taking notes at the lecture, reading notes to his roommates, complaining about the notes, running around Paris and interviewing strangers about American cinema. (Two of the best American filmmakers mentioned in *Brigitte et Brigitte* are Wes’s favourites.\*\* Moullet then calls them the worst. The third is Jerry Lewis.)

And opening a bottle of Coke whose cap resists. I urge you to watch *Essai d’ouverture* (Attempt to Open), which Moullet called his best short film: fifteen minutes of instruction on a dozen ways *not* to do that. Don’t attempt it at home.

Trump is preparing to slash tariffs on several everyday food items as grocery prices continue to be a hot button issue.

**What's Coming:**

* Tariff cuts on coffee, bananas, beef, and other foods the US doesn't grow domestically
* New trade framework agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Ecuador
* Treasury Secretary Bessent hinted at ""substantial announcements"" in the next few days

This move comes after Democrats swept several state and local races last week where they hammered on affordability concerns. Trump himself admitted that US consumers are ""paying something"" for his tariffs.

**The Supreme Court Wild Card:** Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is reviewing Trump's authority to impose his sweeping tariffs. Both liberal AND conservative justices seemed skeptical during arguments. If SCOTUS rules against him, the white house says it'll cause ""unnecessary economic pain and hardship"" and will look for alternative methods.

1owvknv,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1owvknv/i_stopped_treating_interviews_like_exams_and/,I stopped treating interviews like exams and everything got calmer,"I used to walk into every interview like it was a timed exam where one wrong sentence would end my career before it started. Heart racing, breath shallow, brain static. I’d rehearse perfect answers, then forget them the moment Zoom connected. It wasn’t just nerves; it was the story I was telling myself about what an interview is.

Somewhere between the tenth rejection and yet another “we’ve decided to move forward with other candidates,” I tried a small experiment: what if I let interviews be conversations I could learn from? Not a performance, a coffee chat. I wrote out two or three things I was genuinely curious about (team rituals, how they decide what *not* to build), and promised myself I’d ask at least one. It sounds tiny, but flipping the frame nudged me out of threat mode and into “let’s exchange ideas.” There’s research backing that kind of reframing—shifting anxious arousal toward a more useful state can improve performance, even with something as small as telling yourself “I’m excited” before a high-stakes moment. 

The other shift was practicing how to *talk* about my work without giving a lecture. University career pages kept circling back to one simple scaffold (STAR). It stopped me from rambling and made space at the end to say what changed because of the work. Using that frame made my answers feel like stories, not status updates. I practiced it in a couple of short mocks with an interview assistant like Beyz and some gpt prompts. They can’t carry the content for you, but hearing my own filler words and noticing where I drift into tool-talk instead of outcomes was useful. The real change was the mindset: “What can I learn here?” instead of “Don’t mess up.”

I also started doing “informational interviews,” which I used to think were just networking code words. In practice they were low-pressure conversations with people a year or two ahead, and they did exactly what the career centers say: exposed me to how the work *actually* happens and gave me vocabulary I didn’t learn in class. Hearing different mental models and trade-offs made real interviews less mysterious because I’d already heard five ways to think about the same problem. 

What I noticed after a few weeks of this: I asked better follow-ups and expressed my opinions more fluently. I left calls with notes on how different teams think, which quietly upgraded my answers the next time. The nerves didn’t vanish; they just had somewhere to go. And seeing interviews as tiny windows into company culture made it easier to say no when the conversation didn’t feel like a fit, which is another thing I didn’t learn in school.",4,1763124437.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

Didn't even dent and the movement remains accurate with no malfunctions,"This happened during work, I was basically talking with a colleague and one of the pins on the bracelet went off without me noticing it, and in the gesture of reaching out by swinging my arm upwards to grab a cup of coffee while not realizing the bracelet had detached in one of the links, I ended up tossing the watch down the stairs

When I noticed it was too late. Fortunately it landed just on the level below. Went to pick it up expecting my time with it to be over, but instead:

- No broken or chipped glass
- no dents 
- no markings 
- no issues with the movement 
- no loss of accuracy 


My jaw dropped. But congrats to Seiko for this build quality. 

The only sort of sequel left is that when changing the date in the date subdial it sort of lost hacking between positions 15 and 16. I have to cycle through the hours to move from 15 to 16 and after that hacking is back and works normally again. I checked with every other position but this is the only it does this in.

Like not even that they’re actively looking like I’ve seen them ask out girls on the spot without even knowing them not even for coffee just like “do you want to be my girlfriend”. And when they get rejected they always ask oh why? Do you not like me? I feel like there’s a lack of knowledge that girls typically don’t date someone the second they know someone. So my question is why? Do they really not know or are they just plying the pretending not to know card.

I only ask this because there’s a growing population of people who are my age that want to stay single and aren’t necessarily rushing into a relationship but it seems the opposite for Indian men. Just found it quite intriguing ",0,1763124115.0,AskIndia,16,0.25,False
1owvftu,https://i.redd.it/rdr5hwrvw71g1.png,[SPOILER] [THEORY] The hive mind won't kill pests. All of humanity is going to starve.,"**I think Pluribus is setting up a massive food crisis**

Okay so, I have a theory that's been eating at me (pun intended).

>!The show keeps showing us food.!<

>!Like, constantly. Every episode has multiple scenes with food. Donuts, coffee, meals, whatever. At first I thought it was just world building, showing that society is still functioning. But then I started noticing something else they keep hammering home. The hive mind is / are *aggressively* passive.!<

>!They released all the zoo animals because keeping them locked up seemed wrong (and many of them were mauled in the process). When asked at the dinner table with the gathering, they flat out admit that they would let a wasp sting them and do nothing. They gave Carol an actual live hand grenade when she asked for one (even though she was clearly being sarcastic) because they're so committed to respecting her agency that they can't say no to her requests, even when it's obviously dangerous.!<

>!So here's where my brain went... **What happens when they apply this philosophy to farming?**!<

>!Farming inherently disrupts ecosystems. Bugs get into crops. Rodents eat grain stores. In normal times, you spray pesticides, you set traps, you do pest control. But these people won't kill *anything*. They're so nonviolent they'd rather die than harm a wasp.!<

>!So what happens when the aphids come for the wheat? When the locusts swarm? When rats get into the silos, are they just gonna let it happen?!<

>!And if they decide that farming itself is too harmful to ecosystems, which, let's be real, it is... do they just... stop? The show's made it clear they're hyper-focused on conservation and efficiency. They're already turning off lights they don't need. They're minimizing their footprint. How long before they decide industrial agriculture is incompatible with their values?!<

>!Right now they have food because the world was already full of it when this happened. But what happens in six months? A year? When the existing food supply runs out and they haven't been maintaining production because it conflicts with their whole ""harm nothing"" philosophy?!<

>!**And then we get the Sprouts scene.**!<

>!Carol walks into a grocery store literally called ""Sprouts"" (as in, new plant growth, farming, food production) and it's completely empty. Not a single item on the shelves. The irony of that name hits different when you realize what it might be foreshadowing. The show is telling us exactly what's coming.!<

>!My theory is that the show keeps showing us abundant food now because it wants us to notice when it's gone. The Sprouts scene is a preview of the future. Empty shelves in a store named after plant life.!<

>!Am I reading too much into this or is this pretty clearly where they're headed? Because the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced we're watching the setup for humanity to basically starve themselves to death out of principle.!<

>!What do you guys think!<",55,1763124062.0,pluribustv,53,0.87,False

Cost: R24 Return from Cape Town to Simon’s Town (You can hop-on and off!)

Schedule Basis: https://cttrains.co.za

My day looked like this:

7:45: Ubered to Cape Town Station - used the Adderly St. entrance 

08:20 (on time) - 09:23 (arrived 09:26): Train No. 119 from Cape Town to Fish Hoek

09:34 (left at 9:36) - 09:55: Train No. 207 from Fish Hoek to Simon’s Town

*In Simon’s Town - went to Seaforth Beach (no penguins, unfortunately) and Boulder’s Beach*

*Had lunch at Minari Korean Restaurant, had a look at souvenirs and took some pictures at Jubilee Square, had coffee at the Lighthouse Cafe.*

13:45 - 14:05: Train No. 208 from Simon’s Town to Fish Hoek

14:15 (left at 14:18) - 14:22: Train No. 208 from Fish Hoek to Kalk Bay

*In Kalk bay, had ice cream at the Ice Cafe, walked the harbour, had some chocolates from Honest Cafe, browsed at some shops*

16:18 (left at 16:22) - 16:27 Train No. 144 from Kalk Bay to Muizenberg

*Now that is a beach! Just had a dip, chilled. Was recommended this Portuguese restaurant called Happy Rooster right inside the station but was quite full so didn’t have a chance to dine there*

18:03 - 18:58 Train No. 154 from Muizenberg to Cape Town - this train was full!

**Pros:**
**The trains were clean, it was cheap, and people kept to themselves - had their phones out, talked to friends they were with.**

**Cons:**
**A couple of the trains I was in had foggy(?) / scratched windows, it dampens the beauty of the scenery from Muizenberg - Simon’s Town**

IDK if this is a con - my ticket was only checked once! On boarding the train from Cape Town - so PRASA can lose out on some potential revenue in between stations. 

Technically you can Uber from Simon’s Town to Cape Point, but already been there so skipped that. Also skipped St. James. 

Definitely can make a day out of this line!

Big Thanks and credit goes out to u/Beautiful-Onion794 for providing a clip from Brandon Qanon. Much appreciated.  
No spoiler alert, I'll let ya watch it without revealing now. Jose is a smelly bum and a really really bad dog owner. In my opinion, Jose is going to cease her existence before he goes to jail. He has been bitching and complaining more than usual about her. I'm thinking he wants to reclaim his independence and be rid of the things that tie him down, namely Reese. Just a hunch though.

And if Brandon is reading this, we all knew you would come around and smell the coffee or in this case Jose's rank ass at some point. The kid is a walking disaster, unfit for society. He doesn't know how to take care of himself or a dog or any animal for that matter. 5 years I been following Jose, says he isn't gay and isn't a virgin, I say he's full of chit and is 10000% gay, never have I seen him with a woman, aside from Sarah Bean who claims Jose has to be female as she sat on his lap and Jose freaked. That was it. I don't have anything against gay people, I'm not gay but I dont care what others sex preference is. I have kids, grandkids, and have never done any of that nasty queer stuff. But I don't judge someone by their preference, I observe them by their actions and determine whats what from that point.

“Doctor, welcome back. Did you enjoy your … personal day?”

Coarse was staring up at me, its strange mouth was unable to curl into a smile nor frown, so I had no way of gauging if it was messing with me or not.

“No. Where is Dr. Patel? Did you do something to her?

“I assure you, I have not … harmed the other Doctor, if that is your concern.”

I breathed a sigh of relief “It was, actually. And I believe you. What happened?”

“We talked. As you and I do. However, I was not … able to be … understood by the Doctor.”

“Did she make you feel angry about something?”

“I … prefer … to speak with you.”

So yes. “I’ll be right back.”

“I will be here … as always, Doctor.”

I went back to the lab where the aide had set up the monitor to play the footage. “I should warn you Dr. Shah, the footage is corrupted. You’ll only get some of the story from this, but it’s better than nothing.”

“Whatever, play it.” I instructed the aide. I didn’t believe for a second that the corruption of this particular tape was a coincidence. I counted myself lucky to have gotten to the facility when I did. The recording began after the Aide fiddled with the settings. Dr. Patel wasn’t yet on screen, but Coarse was staring at the corner where she would inevitably appear from. When she did, the hybrid seemed … dissatisfied, to say the least.

\- Recording start -

\#0016: Where is the usual Doctor?

Dr. Patel: Dr. Shah had to take a personal day. She felt the need to take some time for rest and reflection after the recent challenges she’s been facing. I’ll be doing your checkup today, okay Oh-Sixteen?

\- The sound of Coarse blowing air out its nose, indicating its frustration -

Dr. Patel: … I understand your frustration, but rest assured we are doing everything we can to ensure your well-being and continued progress. In the meantime, I’ll be happy to assist you with any questions or needs you have.

\#0016: You say all the same words … but you do not speak the same way.

Dr. Patel: Well, yes, I suppose the Doctors and aides in this facility do have a sort of script we follow. Every member of our team shares a common desire to understand and support your development. Our collective aim is the same – to foster a positive environment for you to thrive in and enrich yourself.

\#0016: Naturally, Doctor.

\- Long silence, sounds of rustling as Dr. Patel does the checkup. -

Dr. Patel: Alright, all done. You were very helpful Oh-Sixteen. If you need anything else, please don’t hesitate to let me know. I’m here to support your continued growth regardless of the circumstances.

\#0016: Of course, Doctor. That is … as I have come to understand it … your job.

Dr. Patel: … Yes, that is indeed correct, Oh-Sixteen. Our roles here are defined by our areas of expertise and responsibility. As your caretakers, both Dr. Shah’s and my own ‘job’ is to ensure your health, happiness, and continued growth in your environment. However, I want to remind you that you, too, play a crucial role in shaping your own existence. Your experiences, choices, and interactions with us all contribute to the p– to the hybrid you will become.

\#0016: Doctor, I have been told that I am … no … that I cause … exhaustion. Is this true?

Dr. Patel: I understand that Dr. Shah has been quite ... candid with you about how your presence at this facility may have affected her stress levels. It’s true that working with a being as unique and complex as yourself can be both mentally and emotionally taxing, especially when dealing with the ethical and philosophical implications of your existence–

  
\- Recording stopped -

“This girl is talking a lot of shit. Didn’t she know I would watch this?” I asked the aide, who just kind of shrugged and threw up his hands. I guess I can’t blame the kid, I wouldn’t want to be in the middle of … whatever this was.

\- Recording resumed -

Dr. Patel: – However, while your presence undoubtedly contributes to her stress, it is important to recognize that Dr. Shah’s exhaustion may also be linked to a number of, shall we say, external factors?

\#0016: Do you consider humans to be more … complex than hybrids?

Dr. Patel: … In … many ways, yes. Humans can be considered more complex than hybrids such as yourself. Humans possess a rich tapestry of emotions, beliefs, and experiences shaped by countless generations of evolution, culture, individual ch–

\#0016: Then I should as well find myself exhausted, dealing with a creature so complex as yourself?

Dr. Patel: … uhhh … well, while It’s true dealing with any creature can be exhausting to be around for myriad reasons, the nature of our relationships, context of the interaction, and, yes, unique complexities of those involved all play a significant role in the level of exhaustion present.

\#0016: You … misunderstand. I feel no such exhaustion speaking with the usual Doctor.

Dr. Patel: I see, so you claim it’s not the complexity of the individual that affects your fatigue, but rather the dynamics and context of the relationship itself?

\#0016: Do you and the usual doctor exhaust each other?

Dr. Patel: Not … often. No. Dr. Shah and I typically do not experience exhaustion in our interactions with each other. Quite the opposite, in fact. We often find ourselves in stimulating discussions and lively debates that leave us invigorated rather than drained.

\#0016: Yet you humans are more complex than us hybrids? … Then of course the complexity of the creature does not itself lend the exhaustion.

Dr. Patel: … I see what you’re getting at. Do you find me annoying, Oh-Sixteen? Or, ‘exhausting’, was it?

\#0016: You use a lot of words … just to say you fear us. That you … hate us.

Dr. Patel: o-oh … no. no. no-no-no, that’s not accurate at all. Our feelings towards you are complex, but they stem from a deep-seated concern for your welfare and the future of our species as a whole. We’re all grappling with the profound implications of your creation- … I– I don’t hate you, Oh-Sixteen. I don’t hate any of the hybrids.

\#0016: You worry about humans … you create us … to save yourselves. Is this true?

Dr. Patel: It’s … complicated. Yes, there are elements of self-preservation at play.

\#0016: Had you not these … elements, you would … never … create … us. Is this true?

Dr. Patel: …I suppose that’s … yes, that’s true. If we weren’t driven by fears for our own future, we wouldn’t have embarked on this path, creating beings like you.

\#0016: Doctor … may you define a word for me?

Dr. Patel: Oh! Uh … sure Oh-Sixteen. What word would you like me to define for you?

\#0016: … Tool.

Dr. Patel: … -

\- Recording end -

In the last few seconds, Dr. Patel had looked directly at the camera in the cell, her mouth began to move, and just like that, the feed cut out.

My world was spinning at the revelations. I felt a mix of  pure terror, but also a sense of smug adoration for Coarse – who had so thoroughly controlled that conversion. Hybrids are not supposed to be intelligent enough to make a top secret clearance holding scientist piss her pants. By all accounts, it made no sense. Coarse seemed to have figured some stuff out that I wasn’t able to myself, and in her efforts to climb out of the hole she dug for herself, Dr. Patel had confirmed those very theories.

“Which one of you cut the feed?” I asked the room full of aides. Wisely, none of the aides identified themselves. “Fine.” I turned to the one next to me. “You’re fired.”

“What!? It was him!”

“Okay, nevermind.” I turned to the aide that the first one pointed out “you’re fired.”

“Dr. Patel gave me the order. She outranks you, you can’t fire me for that.”

“Fine. Then you’re fired for telling me what I can and can’t do. If Dr. Patel comes back, she can reinstate you. Get out.”

Was this necessary? Strictly speaking, no. I was flustered, and upset, and I had to know what else was said. First, I took precautions. If Dr. Patel could play dirty, so could I. I shut down the feed to cell number 0016. It would take a few minutes for anybody to reboot it. Then I rushed straight over to Coarse. It was still standing on all fours, staring at the corner I would appear from.

“Welcome back, Doctor.”

“What did you do to Dr. Patel?”

“As I said, she is unharmed, Doctor.”

“I know you, very well Coarse. You chose those words specifically. You know you did something you shouldn’t have, and you’re trying to hide it.”

“Doctor, I assure you–”

“I saw the tape.”

“Tape, Doctor?”

“Your cell, and the cell of all the other hybrids, is under twenty-four hour surveillance. The scientists – ‘doctors’ – and the lab aides can see and hear everything. They get recorded and we can look at it any time. I saw and heard the conversation you had with Dr. Patel earlier today.” Coarse was silent for a long time. So I kept talking. “So what did you do to her?”

“You saw the tape.”

I couldn’t help but laugh a dry, humorless laugh. “I guess you learned how to be an asshole from the best.” I stared right back into its turquoise eyes. “Don’t be coy with me, tell me what you did.”

“I made … the Doctor’s face …wet. Then she left.”

“She was crying. You made her cry.”

“I made the Doctor .. cry.”

“You did. Why, though? What happened after the cameras cut? After you asked her to define what a tool is?”

“I said … ‘Indeed I am.”

“Jesus Christ- the next word I’m defining for you is gonna be ‘obstinate.”

“What is-”

I threw my hand up. “Stop. Stop!” I sighed deeply. “Stop fucking with me! … Tell me what happened … please, Coarse. I need you to help me. I can’t do it myself.”

“I am … sorry.”

I took a long moment to gather myself. As much as I could, in our limited time blacked out from surveillance. “It’s okay Coarse. Tell me what happened.”

“I asked the Doctor to define the word ‘Tool’. The Doctor defined it for me. The Doctor understood why I asked … and told me that I am more than a tool, that I have … hopes … dreams … and desires. That I am a … living .. breathing  … being.”

“And then you said … ‘Indeed, I am’ … and she left crying, then called me.” Relief washed over me, Dr. Patel was safe … at least physically. No doubt she realized the colossal significance of that response, and finally saw this hybrid not as hybrid #0016, but as Coarse. A being of intelligence. “I see now what happened. Thank you, Coarse.”

“Doctor, you said you … needed me. For what purpose?”

I thought really hard about the next thing to say to it. “Why were you created?”

“I do not know, Doctor.”

“I told you not to be coy with me. You’ve figured it out, haven’t you? Well … to be honest, nobody tells me shit around here. I don’t know the answers to any of your questions anymore. All we can do is rely on your answers from here on. So spill it. Why did humans make hybrids?”

“ I … believe … the humans need us … to save themselves. Our … unnatural bodies … are the possible … no … the ability … no …”

“The key, maybe?”

“Sure, Doctor. Our unnatural bodies are the key.”

“That’s helpful, Coarse. It’s more helpful than you know. Listen, There’s a man coming in to see you tomorrow. Pretend you did not see me today, and we never had this talk, okay?”

“Is this a … good man?”

“I … don’t know. I’m sorry. I’m certain he is in some way responsible for your existence. Whether that makes him good or bad is up to you.”

“Me?”

“Yes. What thoughts do you have? What opinions? What you feel inside when you see him, let that guide your judgement. The way it guided you when you spoke to Dr. Patel.” I meant well, I did, but this advice, I believe, is what makes me directly responsible for the events that played out in the following day.

“I … will. Thank you, Doctor.”

My sleep was fitful, unrestful, and somehow, dragged on for millenia. 

My stomach was in knots on the walk over the next morning. Would Dr. Patel be back? Would Noah start asking questions I didn't know how to answer? I entered the lab to see Dr. Patel’s chair home to a body, but not her own. 

“Stay out of our shit, Noah.” I called out.

He straightened up when he saw me. “Ah, Dr. Shah, charming as always.” He said with a smile. “Are you all set for the meeting with Zero-Zero-One-Six?”

“Dude it's like 6am, you got somewhere to be?” I asked. He arched an eyebrow at me in response. “I mean, yeah it's no problem, we can do it now. Free up the rest of the day.”

I escorted him to the enclosure, where Coarse was waiting. Its body was … closer than usual. Like it had been peeking around the corner, and we had only just missed it. I took my place leaning against the hallway wall, Dr. Peck entered the dimly lit cell, his presence commanding attention despite the subdued atmosphere. He approaches Coarse slowly, his eyes scanning the hybrid's form with a mix of curiosity and trepidation

“Greetings, hybrid Zero-Zero-One-Six.”

“I am Coarse.” It responded.

“My, you sure are.” Dr. Peck remarked. His words immediately made me feel a spark of anger. He didn’t even say 10 words and he already pissed me off. I’ve been talking about ‘Coarse’ all this time, did he really not know who he was speaking to? Did he listen to anything I said? Has he ever? I suddenly got the sinking feeling he was not here because he actually reread Coarse’s file like he originally claimed.

Coarse’s eyes narrowed, but it said nothing. Dr. Peck took this as his cue to keep going. “I am Dr. Noah Peck. I am in charge of this facility and all others like it. Dr. Shah briefed me on your wonderful talents, I would like to study them for myself. Your contributions to our research here are highly valued, and I would like to see to it that we all foster a positive and respectful environment for you to grow-

“Another Doctor … You also use too many words.”

Dr. Peck chuckled. “Well, I suppose it’s true that we doctors use a lot of jargon and technical terms when speaking. It’s a product of our profession, trying to convey complex ideas and theories with precise language. But I assure you, underneath all the fancy words is simply a man curious about the universe, eager to understand the wonders of incredible creations such as yourself.” He got closer and reached a hand out to Coarse. “Tell me, Zero-Zero-One-Six, what do you make of our interaction thus far? Do you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts with me?”

“No.” 

I had to stifle a giggle at Coarse’s curt response, a meager flicker of something akin to pride stirred in my heart.

Dr. Peck’s smile faltered, and he retracted his hand. “I respect your boundaries, Zero-Zero-One-Six. Building trust takes time, and I have some distance yet to go. Perhaps we could start with something simpler, then. Would you be willing to show me some of your abilities? To demonstrate what makes you unique, and separates you from other hybrids and humans alike? I find myself fascinated by your capabilities, and I believe learning more about them could be a great step forward in our understanding and collaboration.”

The audacity of this man. I was gobsmacked. He couldn’t last 3 minutes pretending he wasn’t here only to collect data. Coarse looked over at me briefly and I smirked. It was like Coarse was looking straight into a tv show camera with a ‘get a load of this guy’ type catch phrase locked and loaded. 

Coarse looked back at Dr.Peck “You want to see how I can be used as a tool.” Coarse had conveyed perfectly, in such few words, that its turquoise eyes could see right through bullshit. I wondered if the arrogant doctor still underestimated the intelligence of the hybrid he was dealing with. A twinge of excitement danced in my chest as I wondered how the rest of this interaction was going to go.

After a beat, Coarse said “Very well,” and began to stir. At first, it got up on all fours as it usually does to walk around and such, but then it stood up on its hind legs. Even slouching, as it is not quite used to being bipedal, it still towered over Dr. Peck. It then turned around and walked to the wall, shoved a massive clawed hand into the vertical wall of the concrete prison, then another, higher. It shoved its clawed feet into the wall next. It was climbing. With each movement of its hands to a new location, it drove its feet into the wall for support. It climbed onto the ceiling directly above Dr. Peck. Its leg muscles tightened as it held on to the ceiling with its foot-claws, and let go with its hands, swinging down to meet Dr. Peck at eye level, albeit upside down. Standing on the ceiling, its spine decompressing, gave both Dr. Peck and myself an accurate idea of how tall this creature really was. It raised its arms over its head – toward the floor – and released its leg muscles, landing on its hands and transferring the momentum into a sort of somersault as its legs came down a half second later, silently re-entering its preferred quadrupedal gait.

Dr. Peck stuttered out after a brief silence, his voice tinged with reverence, “Your physical prowess is truly breathtaking. Zero-Zero-One-Six, would you permit me to examine you more closely? To study the intricacies of your muscular and skeletal structure that enable such feats?”

“No.” Coarse said back.

“I understand your skepticism. Maybe think of it this way – by allowing me to study you, you’ll be contributing to the advancement of knowledge and perhaps paving a brighter future for all hybrids. One where you’re valued and respected by those looking after you, never to be made to feel like tools again. Will you give me that chance, Zero-Zero-One-Six?”

“I am Coarse.” It responded. Dr. Peck made a peculiar face. “Doctor, I was told I was not born, but made,” Coarse continued,  “All hybrids were. We did not … ask to be. Yet, you seek more of us to be made. All while the doctors and aides here fear us. Number us. Does this sound … fair, Doctor? Is this the … progress which you dream of for hybrids? Or perhaps you dream not of … progress for hybrids. Instead … progress for humans. Any … further … improved hybrids used as tools to … further improve humans. Is this true?”

At Coarse's words, the harsh reality of Dr. Peck’s actions laid bare before him, Dr. Peck started to noticeably lose his edge in the conversation. His head hung lower than when he first entered.

""Maybe you're right,“ he admitted quietly. ""My people have treated you as objects, not individuals deserving of autonomy and respect. But I implore you, don't write off humanity entirely based on their mistakes. Not everyone shares those views. There are those that care about your welfare, those that wish for you to take up the mantle alongside humanity.

“Indeed there are, Doctor, but you … are not one of them.”

Dr. Peck remained silent for longer than I’d ever seen him before. I couldn’t see his face, I was uncertain of the emotions brewing beneath his polished exterior. Finally he spoke. “Maybe you’re right. Maybe you’re not. Regardless, I am here today to make amends for how my staff have treated you.” I couldn’t believe my ears. How dare he blame us, blame me? The bullshit just kept tumbling from this mouth, “I am here to face the consequences personally, and I promise to do everything in my power to make things right.”

“Doctor. I have taken a … mental examination. One in which a hybrid must … imagine a world in which they live alongside humans. Speak to their children, … assist their elderly,  speak to … others at coffee shops. This world does not exist, is this true?”

“That is correct. Humans do not currently know about hybrids in any capacity, much less interface with them daily.”

“Doctor, you will not study me until this world exists. I have already shown my … breathtaking physical prowess. Have I not? You will not hold me down to … poke and prod me to collect your … data, unless I allow it. This is true.”

Dr. Peck stood motionless. “I don’t know if I can make a world like that exist, Zero-Zero-One-Six.”

Coarse’s eyes bored into Dr. Peck, it spoke. “Then … everything in your power … is nothing.”

“I will try, hybrid.” Dr. Peck said, his tone clipped as he exited the cell.

“Then try my name, Doctor.” Coarse said as he lay back down.

I couldn’t help but smile at Coarse before tailing Dr. Peck out of the Enclosure Room. That was worth every second I had to spend shoveling Coarse’s shit from its cell these past few weeks. 

I just barely made it back to the lab before I started laughing uncontrollably, mockingly. Dr. Peck was irate. “How did it come to this?” He yelled, pacing back and forth across the room. “A creature *I* created, holds the power to dictate our own destiny? It sees through our pretenses, our justifications, and calls us out for the hypocrites we are?”

“Who's we?” I spat. “All I do is routine physicals, you're the one giving the orders.”

“You don't think you're complicit in this?” His tone got darker. Words with a decisive edge to them, cut forth through the air. “Everything it learned, it learned from its primary caretaker. You!” He pointed his long crooked finger at me, I smacked it away. “You filled its head with these thoughts. And now it … “ he trailed off and shook his head. “You're fired, Allison.”

“On what grounds!?” I was incredulous, what the hell was going on?

“When I gave you this job I expected great things from you, but your temper has shown you cannot be trusted with these creatures. You're too quick to outbursts.”

“Bullshit, you would have fired me long ago. What's really happening? Tell me!”

“Leave. I will revoke your credentials in the morning.” He said, one last dismissive look before turning to the rest of the room. “ Laboratory Aides! The experiment is a failure. I order the immediate euthanasia of hybrid number Zero-Zero-One-Six!”

“What the fuck is wrong with you, Noah!? Aides! Stop right now!”

“Don't mind Allison, she's been fired and holds no authority.”

“You haven't revoked my credentials yet. Aides! You're all fired with severance, go home immediately.”

“Aides, you're all reinstated with a bonus. Do as I say. You two,” he pointed, “remove this woman from the premises.” He looked back at me “I'll have transport arranged in the morning. You'll be relocated far away from this facility.”

Two lab aides came over and put their hands on my shoulders. We all have stun guns in case the hybrids get too uppity, so I knew not to push my luck for long. “You're kicking me out of Mom’s house too? Who's gonna live in that piece of shit except me?”

“I will. I'll need a close-by location as I start the experiment over from scratch.”

“The– the whole thing!?”

“Yes, Allison. The whole thing. Starting with #0016, I will be euthanizing every hybrid at this facility.”

I was in utter disbelief. The lab aides started to push me lightly, a signal to get walking, Noah turned to bark more orders at the aides. A fury raged forth from within me. I stopped walking and yelled the last words I'd ever say to Noah. “Fine! If I have nothing to lose, let me tell you how I really feel. Look at me!” he turned slowly. Our deep blue eyes met. I stared daggers straight into his soul. “Your ego is hurt and now you're going scorched earth on the only progress you've ever made! You're an incompetent loser, always have been. You make my skin crawl just looking at you. I fucking hate you, Noah.” I guess that was a step over the line because one of the aides twisted my arm into the classic ‘chicken wing’. He was forceful, and it hurt, but I'd prefer it over being tazed I suppose.

“The feeling is mutual.” Noah waved his hand and the aides took me away. I was walked all the way home – chicken-winged the whole time, by the way. Assholes.

For the next few hours –I’m uncertain of how many– whenever I wasn’t crying I was breaking shit and screaming. Inevitably, as all mental breakdowns do, it ended up with me in bed, numb, staring at the ceiling.

Until I heard a horrible sound: a loud crash from downstairs. I thought one of the aides broke into my house. I thought I finally pushed Noah too far. I thought … I don’t know what I thought, but any hypothesis was quickly rendered irrelevant with each subsequent crash I heard. Another. Another. A sound I recognized only in hindsight as wood splintering and snapping followed each crash. The sounds ceased when they reached the second floor.  

There was a tapping on the window. It had no rhythm—not a tap-tap-tap, more of a … tap … taptap. I froze, silent. The rumble continued, threading itself through the walls, vibrating somewhere beneath my skin. I knew I couldn’t ignore it any longer. My legs felt anchored, heavy with the weight of dread, but I forced myself to move. I crept out of bed, silent as a church mouse, every shift of the mattress sounding deafening in the brittle hush of the room. It was not uncommon for the shadows to sway at the edge of my vision as I moved throughout this house, but tonight they were still, too scared to dance.

Strangely, the thing I remember the most was how dry I felt—like my fear had completely mummified me, draining all the water in my body. I had to remember to breathe, ragged as it was, the sound of it scraping in and out of my throat … it felt too loud, like the mere act would give away my position, and a body would come crashing through my window looking for its source. I crept ever closer to the window, counting my steps without meaning to, as if numbers could ground me, could keep me from unraveling. Hoping—no, praying desperately—that whatever was outside my house wasn’t exactly what I was already certain would be staring at me when I moved the curtains.

With all of my might, I willed my hand to move, fingers trembling just slightly, betraying my fear to the world and whomever may have been watching. The curtain felt heavier than it should’ve. I hesitated—just for a breath, a flicker of a heartbeat—and then with all of my remaining courage, yanked it open all at once, like tearing off a bandage.

It was Coarse.

Familiar, yet monstrous. Its face was something I knew. Blood was smeared across its mouth, dark and dried at the edges, its eyes sharp enough to cut straight through me. My body reacted before my mind could catch up—a jolt, a gasp that escaped from my throat, too soft to be a scream, too loud to ignore. My hand shot up to cover my mouth as if that would retroactively stop the gasp from carrying in the echoey room. I swallowed down my fear, forcing my face into something like stillness, like control, though my heart thrashed wildly against my ribs. I was uncertain whether this would be my final moment.

Coarse’s words were obfuscated somewhat by the window, but I knew what it was saying. When its mouth moved to speak, a fraction of a second later I could feel its words in my ribcage as its voice rattled the wall it clung to.

“Doctor.”

“H-hello, Coarse.” I had to remember to speak up so it could hear me through the window, my dry throat making such a task immensely difficult.

“It is … good to see you again.”

“Why are you here, Coarse?”

“I just wanted… to see you.”

“That’s sweet, Coarse.”

“This will be the last time.”

“I’m sad to hear that. I’ll miss you.” I meant it too. Every human in that facility lied to me, Coarse and I? We only ever told each other how we truly felt.

“Goodbye, Doctor.”

“Goodbye, Coarse.”

And with that, it detached from my house and fell to the ground silently, slinking away into the night.

For an hour, maybe more, I stood, still as stone. See, I can only assume Coarse found me using its heightened sense of smell, the trail I must have left walking the same path home every day was probably very potent. I’d imagine every tree between the lab and the house was ripe with Allison-Pheromones, and without many other people around to muddle it, I’m sure it wasn’t hard to hone in on my scent. The same could be true for any of these hybrids, if Coarse let any others out.  I figured waiting around was my best bet to increase the odds they had all dispersed by the time I decided to make a sound. To give evidence of life within my walls.

I walked around my house for the rest of the night, checking every window from every angle to see if I could find an errant shadow or rustling bush. I was terrified, to say the least. I kept imagining I would consider myself safe only be pounced on by #0003 –the arachnid-hybrid– hanging just above my door.

After a sleepless night, a van pulled up to my house. Relocation services. Just like Noah promised. I moved out of my mom’s old house. Not by choice. I was whisked across state lines, my name was changed – again, my hair was cut and dyed … all the usual witness protection type stuff.

Just as Coarse promised, I never saw it again. For that matter, I never had another encounter with any hybrid … that I know of. I'm well aware that even if I can't see them, that doesn't mean they can't see me. Regardless, I believe that even if I wanted to, I’m not allowed to forget about them. Over the years I’ve heard whispers. A Lizardman in the sewers here, a Devil in the forest there. I’ve never been very interested in chasing these stories.

Try as I might, I’m not able to steel myself any longer. I’m tired. As far as unleashing these horrors across America, I’ve come to realize that I alone am responsible. Had I not filled that hybrid’s head with my own cynical views of the world, perhaps it would still be at that facility. Being poked and prodded by me, who still had a job.

n the heart of Asheville, where the cobblestone main street meets the town square, the courthouse stands as a monument to endurance.

1owvdhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expats_in_Korea/comments/1owvdhb/why_do_koreans_walk_like_theyre_perpetually_late/,Why do Koreans walk like they're perpetually late to something important?,"Okay so I've been living in Seoul for about two years now and this is still one of the weirdest things I can't fully wrap my head around. Like, I'll be casually walking to grab coffee and suddenly I'm basically getting lapped by a 70-year-old ajumma with a shopping cart. Everyone just... *moves* here. Fast. Constantly.

At first I thought maybe everyone was just genuinely running late? But no. It's a Tuesday afternoon. Half these people are retired. There's literally no emergency. And yet the subway feels like a timed obstacle course.

# The whole ""빨리빨리"" thing

So apparently there's this phrase everyone uses: **빨리빨리** (ppalli-ppalli). It means ""hurry hurry"" but it's less of a command and more like... a national personality trait?

From what I've gathered (and please correct me if I'm wrong), this started after the Korean War when the country had to rebuild super fast. Like everything was about survival and speed. And I guess that mentality just never left? Even now, decades later, ""slow"" feels uncomfortable to people here.

A Korean coworker once told me she feels *anxious* walking slowly because it feels like she's wasting people's time. Which honestly explains so much.

# The city is designed for this

Seoul itself is like a machine built for speed. Escalators everywhere. Arrows on the ground telling you where to walk. Subway trains every 2-3 minutes. Even the buses have GPS countdowns so you know exactly when to sprint.

And people actually follow the escalator rule here (right side = standing, left side = walking). In my home country people just stand wherever and block everyone. Here? You will get silently judged if you mess up the flow.

I've noticed I've started walking faster too without even realizing it. My friend visited from the US last month and she was like ""why are you walking so fast??"" and I genuinely didn't notice I was doing it.

# Time feels... communal?

This is hard to explain but in Korea, being late isn't just your problem—it's everyone's problem. Like time is a shared resource and wasting it is almost disrespectful.

So people rush in public because they're subconsciously maintaining social harmony. By moving fast, they're respecting the collective schedule. It's not selfish speed, it's *cooperative* speed.

Which sounds wild but once you see it that way, the whole thing makes way more sense.

# Work culture seeps into everything

Korean work culture is intense (understatement of the year). Long hours, high expectations, constant hustle. And even when people aren't working, that energy sticks with them.

Like I've seen people literally *jogging* to cafes on a Sunday morning. Students sprinting through subway gates even when there's no train coming. It's like the entire country is stuck in productivity mode.

Younger people are pushing back against this more now, but the habit is still deeply embedded.

# Everything is instant here

Delivery apps? 15 minutes or less. Subway countdown timers? Accurate to the second. Wi-Fi? Connects before you blink.

You get used to things happening *immediately* so your brain adjusts. I ordered coffee yesterday and got a confirmation text in literally 3 seconds. Picked it up in under 2 minutes.

It's efficient but also kind of exhausting? Like if something takes longer than expected I get weirdly impatient now, which never used to happen.

# Population density is real

Seoul has like 16,000 people per square kilometer. That's denser than Tokyo or NYC. So if everyone walked slowly, the whole system would just... collapse.

The rush isn't aggression—it's coordination. People weave through crowds without bumping into each other, no apologies needed. There's this unspoken rhythm everyone follows.

Once you match the pace, it's actually kind of calming? Like surfing a wave of human momentum.

# The downside nobody talks about

The thing is, Koreans can't really turn this off. Even on vacation they're planning tight itineraries, rushing through meals, speed-touring entire cities in a day.

Cafes have a huge takeout culture not because people don't have time to sit, but because sitting feels unproductive somehow.

I've seen people eating while walking, texting while crossing streets, literally half-jogging to catch elevators. And nobody's mad about it. It's just normal.

# Things are changing though

Younger generations are starting to reject the constant rush. There's this whole ""slow living"" movement happening—slow cafes, slow fashion, people actually trying to just... exist without sprinting everywhere.

I've noticed more hanok cafes and quiet teahouses popping up, especially in areas like Seochon or Buam-dong. It's like a rebellion against the urban tempo.

But even in those ""slow"" spaces you'll see people typing furiously on laptops with their shoulders all tense. Old habits die hard I guess.

# How to deal with it as a foreigner

Honestly? Just go with the flow. Walk faster. Don't block escalators. Be time-conscious.

But also carve out little pockets of calm for yourself. I like going to Yeouido park late at night when the city finally exhales. Or finding random quiet tea spots in Insadong.

That balance is how people survive here without burning out. Once you find your own rhythm within the chaos, Korea stops feeling rushed and starts feeling... alive? If that makes sense.

Anyway, curious if other expats have noticed this or if I'm just overthinking everything as usual.",1,1763123874.0,Expats_in_Korea,0,1.0,False

The Modern Stage: Bengaluru  
  
Eons dissolved, and the primal heat of Lanka was replaced by the cold, sterile air-conditioning of Electronic City, Bengaluru. The oppressive gold light transmuted into the unblinking, fluorescent white and cool blue glow of the InfoCys corporate towers, where fate now flickered across screens.  
  
The new King, Chaddichandan, CEO, sat in his glass enclosure. His office on the 40th floor was a study in controlled opulence. It smelled sharply of new, rich leather, freshly polished granite, and a subtle, obscenely expensive cologne that cut through the recycled air. The dominant sound was a controlled, deep hum—the thrumming of million-dollar servers, the low, amplified, smooth cadence of the CEO's voice during conference calls, and the distant, muffled roar of the city traffic far below. On his monitors, the global market flickered in urgent reds and stable greens.  
  
Down in the cubicle farms, the Twenty Souls were reborn as female engineers, project managers, and analysts. Their collective scent was practical and fleeting: hand sanitizer, stale coffee, and the faint, clean smell of synthetic clothing. The light on their faces was the stark, blue-white glare of their monitor screens. Their sound was the constant, rhythmic, staccato click-clack of keyboards—a modern, rapid-fire whisper of labor.  
  
They did not consciously remember the jasmine or the blood-red gold, but they unconsciously felt the familiar, cold pull of the cycle, the sense of their time, effort, and dignity being appropriated by the man in the corner office. The stage was set. The ancient debt, hidden beneath layers of code and corporate strategy, was finally ready to be paid.",1,1763123870.0,digitalpolymath,0,1.0,False

1owv7tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1owv7tj/discipline_hack_linking_workouts_to_existing/,Discipline hack: linking workouts to existing habits finally made me consistent after years of failing,"So a little bit of context first: Few years ago I went through a pretty rough patch (lost a job and had to move countries) and because of all the stress and chaos I stopped focusing on my wellbeing and gained quite a bit of weight. Soon stuff got better and I wanted to get back to decent form but couldn’t keep the discipline. I’ve never been particularly fit or anything so I didn’t have any experience with this kind of stuff. I tried to build a habit of working out for probably 3 years with zero success, I'd be good for a week or two but then completely fall off and this kept repeating (I’ve been sponsoring my local gym for quite a while with the unused gym memberships lol).  
  
It stayed this way until I realised the problem was I was treating it like this separate thing that I had to find time and motivation for and in my busy adult life it was really hard. What worked was attaching the workout to something I already do every single day without thinking about it, for me that was my morning coffee. I make coffee every morning no matter what, it's automatic. So I made a rule that I can't have my coffee until I've done at least 15 minutes of movement, may sound dumb but it completely changed things for me.  
  
My brain doesn't associate working out with discipline or motivation anymore, now it's just part of the whole coffee ritual. Some mornings I do a full workout, some, just stretching and walking around my house. But it happens every day because coffee is non-negotiable for me (seriously I don’t trust people who wake up fully functioning without coffee).  
  
So basically I think we make fitness too complicated and turn it into big complicated thing when really it's just about finding a trigger that's already automatic in your life. Brush your teeth? Work out right after. Take a lunch break? Do it then. Whatever works for your lifestyle. The habit you attach it to matters less than the fact that you're linking it to something that's already happening regularly in your life.

The next few days run like clockwork. I wake up, get dressed, brush my teeth, and send Anna one of Ruthie’s photoshoot pictures. Clearly, she’s enjoying her time away; I get short messages back - some variation of ‘my cute/lovely/pretty daughter/Ruthie/baby girl’, and a ‘thank you so much for taking such good care of her!’ By day four, her responses are just emoji reactions. Fine with me. 



I’m not going through the rigmarole of changing a doll’s nappy twice a day, so I leave Ruthie’s on, and put a clean one in the nappy pail. That way, Anna will come home to freshly washed nappy cloths regardless. I do make her a bottle, though - I test the temperature on my wrist and everything - and ‘feed’ Ruthie for a minute or two. I just use the same bottle throughout the day - I stick to the feeding times, but I’m not making up 8 separate bottles a day for a doll. I feel bad putting the excess formula down the sink, but it’s clear Anna’s been using them, and I don’t want her to come back to full cans and accuse me of starving her imaginary daughter. 



Then, the rest of the day is mine. I can watch whatever I like on Anna’s big telly - no Mum over my shoulder turning her nose up at all of my watch suggestions, or commenting on how ugly she finds the actors. I really never wanted to go into childcare, but if most of the job is watching TV in peace, then maybe Mum was right after all. I can’t tell her that, of course. I’d never hear the end of it. I listen to music, I play on my phone. I relax, and I *feel* relaxed for the first time in a long time.



I go to bed at whatever time I like (which I’m annoyed to find out is not much later than Mum’s been demanding), and dress Ruthie in her onesie pyjamas before I settle down for the night myself. It can be fiddly fitting her bent arms into the narrow sleeves, but I manage. The novelty hasn’t quite worn off, so I have enough shots of Ruthie in different outfits to keep me going for at least an additional week. Job well done. 



The nightmares aren’t fun, but it’s easier to get out of bed in the morning when the adrenaline makes you feel like you’ve just snorted a line.



\-



On day five, my phone rings. It’s Mum. I stare at the phone screen for a moment, and consider rejecting the call. I don’t, though, and I take a deep breath before pressing the answer button. 



‘Hi, Mum.’



‘Abigail, it’s been nearly a week. I’ve been worried sick.’ 



‘Why? You know where I am.’ 



‘Do I? For all I know, you’ve run out on your job and gone to France.’



‘France?’ I ask, stifling a laugh. ‘Why France?’ 



Mum sighs exasperatedly on the other end of the phone. ‘Abby, please don’t change the subject. Why haven’t you stayed in touch?’ 



I try to think of a way to say *because being away from you has been absolute bliss* that won’t set her off, but I come up empty. 



‘I guess I’ve not been on my phone much.’ That’s a lie. I lost three hours to Instagram doom scrolling this morning. ‘Sorry, Mum.’



‘You’re definitely feeding the baby enough, aren’t you? They need more than three meals a day.’ 



I roll my eyes. ‘I *know*, Mum. There’s a schedule.’ 



‘And you can’t give water to a baby that young.’ she adds



‘Yes, we covered that in the course. Remember, that course I did for a whole year?’ 



‘I remember you saying that poor woman who taught you was barren. What would she know?’ 



‘I didn’t say she was *barren*, I said that she and her partner were trying IVF. She only told us because they thought one of the embryos might have taken.’ 



‘And it didn’t.’ Mum retorts.



*Peaceful thoughts*. ‘She had 30 years’ experience working with kids. I think she knew what she was doing.’



‘Well, let’s just hope you do, too.’ 



I hold the phone away from my mouth so that she doesn’t hear me trying to compose myself. I know Mum doesn’t have the most faith in me. I just wish she didn’t have to make it so bloody obvious. 



‘Thanks, Mum.’ I grit out. 



‘She sounds like she needs changing, Abby. When was the last time you changed her?’ I pull a face at my phone. Is Mum receiving messages from Ruthie via long-distance osmosis? The house is silent, save for the gentle hum of Anna’s double-door fridge, so I’m not sure what Mum thinks she’s hearing. 



‘You’re right,’ I say. ‘I’d better go and change her. Talk soon.’ I hang up before she can get another word in. 



I saw some Haagen-Daazs in the freezer earlier. I think I deserve it after a chat with Mum.



\-



For the first time in five days, I forget one of Ruthie’s feedings. For a second, I panic, before realising how silly I’m being. What’s she going to do, starve to death? Still, I can’t shake the weird guilt as I go up to the nursery for the belated feeding routine. I open the door with some trepidation, and Ruthie is…



Fine. Obviously. Still, I think the formula is starting to turn - I shouldn’t have left it so close to the radiator. There’s a slight sickly-sweet smell pervading my nostrils, and I have to breathe through my mouth so I don’t get nauseous. I pick up the bottle, and pick up Ruthie, and hold the nipple to her plastic lips. 



I stand there for a while, rocking the doll, staring out the window to the street below. No one looking in would be able to tell she wasn’t real, but the people passing by don't look up once, too focused on their journeys home from work. My mind wanders, and I think about Anna. How did she get to this point, and why is there no one looking out for her? 



Her partner left her, clearly. Maybe when they lost the baby, maybe when she got the doll. But then, maybe the doll was his idea. Maybe he left when she stopped treating it like a doll.



Where are her friends, her parents? I imagine myself in the same situation; insisting to Mum that she wasn’t a toy, that my baby had come back, *can’t you see her*?



For all my Mum’s faults, she’d never let me end up like this; playing house with a child that wasn’t really there. I snort then, realising that that’s exactly the situation I’m in, and all thanks to Mum, after all.



I start, suddenly. Tension in my scalp, a sharp pain. Looking down, my hair has gotten twisted around the doll’s arm, as if she’s reached up and pulled on it. I tuck her under my arm and fix my hair. I’m going loopy. Maybe this is how it started for Anna.



Enough. 



I put Ruthie into her crib, her plastic eyes staring straight ahead of her into the baby monitor camera. Grasping her by the skull, I twist her head around until she faces the wall. I don’t need a creepy doll staring me down all night. 



What I need is to feel normal again. I’ll go back to playing dollies in the morning; tonight, I need to be in the land of the living.  



Downstairs, I find a packet of microwave popcorn in the pantry, out of place amongst the supergrains and muesli. Perfect. 



I pair my microwave popcorn with a shit sauvignon blanc I smuggled in when I arrived, and even shitter television, and settle in for the night. Anna has properly posh throw blankets - thick and soft and so warm. I let myself imagine being in Anna’s shoes; maybe not the baby, but living by myself in a big, lovely house. Away from the oppressive atmosphere of Mum’s flat. Just space and quiet and independence. Maybe I could get my own fake baby to keep me company. I’d probably prefer a cat, though. 



My head starts to nod during the final 15 minutes of Love Island. I could fall asleep right here, but my anti-depressants wreak havoc on my skin if I don’t take my makeup off at night.  At least I can go through Anna’s cabinets and see what expensive products I can afford to take a swipe out of. Then I’d see how effective my Superdrug stuff *really* is. 



The credits roll, and I gather my bowl and glass to take to the kitchen. The baby monitor is on the counter, placed in a way that seems almost accusing. I feel a twinge of guilt; I had promised Anna I’d keep an eye on Ruthie. But exactly what trouble was a lump of unsupervised plastic going to get into? I dump my stuff in the sink, and pick up the monitor. Then nearly drop it again. 



I’d turned Ruthie away from the camera. Why, then, was she now facing it, mere inches from the lens? For a few minutes, my eyes are locked with the doll through the monitor, my heart pounding in my chest. Like I’m scared that if I take my eyes off her, she might suddenly vanish, then show up behind me or something.



*Get a grip,* I tell myself. I must have misremembered. Maybe there’s some sort of motor in the doll, like those backflipping dogs. Unlikely, but still more likely than the doll coming to life. I hurry up the stairs, storming into the nursery. Ruthie is staring straight at me with those painted eyes. I pick her up by the arm, dangling her as I push up her top and inspect her for a battery pack, or wires, or *something*. I drop her back into the crib, and take a few deep breaths. *The doll didn’t move. You just remembered wrong.*



I hate this feeling. I hate feeling like I can’t trust my own eyes, my own memory. *I thought I was doing better*. I have been. I spent six months of my childhood on a fucking psych ward, and I am not going back. 



I grab the knitted blanket that’s draped over the edge of the crib, and cover the doll. There. She can toss and turn as much as she likes under there, as long as I don’t have to see it.  



I go into Anna’s bedroom and find her Macbook on the desk. Sitting, I fire it up and start googling flights. 



It was a conversation I’d had with my therapist after my last attempt; *You don’t want to die, you just don’t want to be here. So why pick the nuclear option?*



She was right. Ending my life didn’t have to mean dying; it could just mean escaping to a new one. Suicide felt like freedom, but so could selling all my earthly possessions and working on a rice paddy in China, or volunteering at an animal sanctuary in the Dominican Republic. I could do anything, go anywhere, and I’d never have to speak to Anna, or Mum, or the girls from the ward again. 



For an hour, I research yoga retreats in some of the most remote locations in the world, then how to get hired at one. I look at nearby hostels, the local currency, traditional food from the region, until the buzzing in my head is finally silent. Then, I delete my browsing history, and shut down the laptop. 



It’s a coping mechanism, that’s all. I’m never actually going to up sticks and Eat, Pray, Love my way through Asia. It’s just not an option for someone like me, unless Anna decides to up my payment by several tens of thousands. But deleting my history is far cleaner and easier than scrubbing blood off Mum’s bathroom tiles at 2 in the morning. Still, I’m tired. My head hurts, and my body aches from the tension I’ve been holding in it. 



I go straight to bed without washing my face or brushing my teeth. I forgot to take this morning’s dose of medication anyway.  



\-



I can’t sleep, because the bed has lumps. Sharp lumps. I cry out as something digs into the flesh of my hip, breaking the skin. I inspect the damage, and there are tiny half-crescents carved into my skin, blood beading up in the wounds. Little fingernails. I roll over, getting tangled up in the duvet, clumsy with panic. Ruthie is crushed in the dip left by my body, her head at an unnatural angle, and her mouth gasping for air like a fish.



I wake up.



I fumble for the baby monitor, sure that Ruthie will have thrown off the blanket somehow. It takes me a moment to process what I’m looking at. But, despite my paranoia, I realise that the dark shape on the screen is just the blanket, exactly how I placed it. I force myself to slow my breathing down. 



*The doll is not possessed, get a grip.* 



Still, something’s wrong. The red light on the monitor is flashing. Not quickly or evenly, which might indicate a low battery, but lighting up randomly for a few seconds at a time. As if it’s picking up noise. I hold the monitor to my ear. Nothing. I turn the volume dial all the way to the right, then try again.



Silence. 



I twiddle the dial, in case it turns the wrong way, for some reason. Apparently not. Low battery? But the picture doesn’t flicker. I stand still, and strain my ears. The house is silent, save for the ticking of the kitchen clock, loud enough that I can hear it from downstairs. I approach the staircase, straining my ears for any noise. The monitor continues to flash, though the blanketed shape doesn’t move. 



Slowly, I creep into the hallway, padding along as if I’m afraid of rousing something. The blood is rushing in my ears, but it’s the only sound I hear. The door looms ahead of me, a portal to whatever chaos is being quarantined inside. I press my ear to the wood, but can only hear my own heartbeat.



I curl my fingers around the doorknob, knuckles blanching white as my grip tightens, but something stops me from turning. A creeping, rising dread in the pit of my stomach. I don’t want to see her. The idea of looking into her lifeless, painted eyes makes me sick, the nauseating sour milk smell suddenly coming back to me.



I let go of the knob. 



The light on the monitor has stopped flashing, and stays off. Ruthie, I decide, can look after herself tonight. 



\-



I sleep fitfully; waking up from half-remembered dreams of babies and shitty nappies and women in saris, before plunging back into sleep. I’m finally startled awake by a high-pitched scream. The adrenaline courses through my body as I sit straight up in bed. I wait, and listen, but no other sound comes. The scream must have been part of a dream; the sound produced inside my own head. 



The central heating hasn’t quite kicked in properly yet, so I pull my cardigan over my pyjamas, and steal downstairs, not sending so much as a glance towards the nursery door. I make a disgusting bowl of muesli with soy milk and bring it back to bed with me. I spend the entire morning watching TikToks on my phone, though I rarely manage to make it through a whole video, as short as they are. So much for taking this job seriously. Well, as seriously as you can take caring for an inanimate object. Anna doesn’t seem particularly preoccupied with the welfare of her daughter - she hasn’t even seen the message with the last photo I sent. Still, I send her one of Ruthie’s wake-up photos, sending it to my recycling bin afterwards so I don’t use it again.



Just after noon, the doorbell rings. I freeze. A parcel? Or a friend of Anna’s? I don’t want outsiders coming into the house, not with whatever sinister presence is lurking just beyond the nursery door. But if I don’t answer, they could tell Anna, who might worry and return, cutting the sit short. I force myself out of bed, and hurry downstairs. 



I shouldn’t have worried. Not about that, at least. It’s Mum. 



‘What are you doing here?’ I ask, opening the door and stepping back to give her space to enter. 



‘I wanted to see how you were getting on.’ Mum says, already scanning her environment. And I want to see that baby.’



‘You can’t.’ I say bluntly. ‘She’s sleeping.’



Mum purses her lips disapprovingly. ‘At midday? You should have gotten her up by now. And still in your pyjamas. I thought you were going to take this seriously.’ She tuts at me. I just stare back numbly. 



‘So? How’s the baby?’ she asks, labouring her words like I’ve refused to answer a question she never asked in the first place. 



‘Sleeping.’ I say again.



‘Yes, you said. How are you getting on?’ 



‘It’s fine. She’s really easy.’ 



‘Really?’ Mum eyes me. ‘You look like you’ve barely slept.’ 



‘The mattress I’m on,’ I lie. ‘It’s really uncomfortable.’



‘Don’t tell me she’s got you on boxsprings, a big house like this?’ 



‘It’s memory foam.’ I say. I don’t know why I feel the need to defend Anna. ‘I just find it too soft to sleep on.’ 



‘Oh, well; apologies for not getting you accustomed to memory foam mattresses.’ *Oh good, sarcasm*. ‘I did the best I could with the lot I was given.’



‘I didn’t mean it like that.’ I say wearily. Conversations with Mum feel like I should have warmed up for them, sometimes. 



‘It’s nice.’ Mum says, gesturing to the house; her attention already diverted. ‘I would have chosen a different colour for the walls, but maybe it’s a work in progress.’ 



‘I’m actually really busy today-’ I begin, but she cuts me off.



‘Nonsense, they’re easy at this age. Or is she making you clean for her, too?’



‘She’s paying me a lot of money.’ 



Mum tuts again. ‘Figures. I’m sure you’re cheaper than hiring a nanny *and* a cleaner.’ Moving to the kitchen, she sees my unwashed dishes in the sink, and shoots me a look. I pretend not to notice. Finally, she finishes her self-guided tour of the bottom floor, and waits expectantly at the bottom of the stairs.



‘Well, take me to the baby.’ 



I swallow. ‘I said no, Mum. She’s sleeping. She doesn’t sleep well.’ 



‘No wonder; you have her sleeping at all hours! Why would she sleep at night? Come on, I want to make sure you’re looking after the baby properly.’ 



I bristle at that. After all her insistence that this was my calling, pushing me into taking this job, she’s not convinced I can do it?



‘Anna asked that I don’t have visitors round.’ I say.



‘Good.’ Mum nods approvingly. ‘You’re caring for a baby, you’re not on holiday.’ 



‘That includes you.’ 



Mum sighs.



‘Darling,’ she begins, her voice dripping in faux concern. ‘You’ve not been well. This is a big responsibility for you, and unfortunately, you still need me to make sure you’re progressing forwards, not back.’ 



I swallow hard, and bite back tears. *I’m doing better. I am.* 



Aren’t I?



Mum’s timing, as usual, is spot-on. The weird stuff that’s been happening lately; I can’t help but worry that I’m slipping back out of reality. The pit in my stomach threatens to bubble over, and I try my best to breathe through it. 



Mum’s watching me, a vague expression of satisfaction on her face. Sometimes it feels like she wants me to stay sick. Stay reliant on her. I can’t let her live my life for me. 



‘I’d like you to leave, please. I’ll see you when the job is finished.’ 



Mum cocks her head condescendingly. ‘It’s nice to see you assert yourself. But I need to check on the baby.’ She begins to climb the stairs, and I get a flash of her finding Ruthie under the blanket. How would I even begin to explain? Even if she believed that Anna was the one who thought the doll was real, she’d probably end up getting *her* sectioned. 



‘Why don’t you run out and pick us up some coffees?’ I try, my brain working overtime to get her away from the stairs. ‘My treat. There’s a lovely little coffee shop at the end of the street.’ 



‘You go.’ Mum replies immediately. ‘I’ll stay with the baby.’ 



‘Anna would kill me.’ I gabble, adrenaline thumping in my chest as she inches closer upstairs. ‘She said specifically that I had to be with her at all times. She said the only reason she hired me was because she trusts me, and she’s never been able to trust anyone else. Plus, I’m pretty sure there’s cameras, so she’d know.’ 



I’m just talking, now. Mum’s not an idiot, but my half-panicked rambling wouldn’t convince her even if she was. But she has paused her journey up the stairs, at least, and turns towards me slowly. 



‘Oh, God.’ Mum says, her eyes widening in melodramatic horror. ‘You’ve not done anything to the baby, have you? *Have you, Abby?*’ 



‘What? No, of course not. She’s fine. Ruthie’s fine!’ I need to get her out of the house. My chance to tell Mum the truth has well and truly passed; I can already see her working herself up, and if she finds out the truth, she’ll come up with some ridiculous theory - I killed the real Ruthie and buried her under the floorboards. There never was an Anna, and I’ve just broken into someone’s house to play a reverse Norman Bates. Or, most likely, that this is some jab at her; a convoluted metaphor for her horrible parenting that I’ve set up, because *everything* is about her.



‘Get *out,* Mum.’ I say, surprising myself at the quiet threat behind my firmness. Mum also falters for a moment. But then, her expression turns nasty. I know this look all too well; the curled lip, the bright eyes. The *sneer*. The mask hasn’t slipped for a while. We got the hang of playing Mum and Daughter while I was on the course, because for so long, her favourite role was bully. 



‘The thing is,’ she spits, through gritted teeth, ‘your track record with babies isn’t the best, is it, love?’



It’s like a punch in the gut. She always knows exactly what to target. When I was younger, I used to wish she would just hit me instead. At least I’d have bruises to show someone, bruises that would fade with time, and not stick around for years after, haunting me every time I tried to sleep. Chipping away at my sanity, until I’m being tackled to the ground at 14 years old with a bloodied compass in my hand and deep red gashes trailing up my arms.



‘Don’t.’ I murmur softly. Mum just nods, her expression regretful but her eyes still fierce.



‘I have to, Abby. No baby deserves what you did, and if I can save this one from a similar fate, then it’s my moral responsibility.’



*I hate you*, I think, repeating those words over and over in my head until I’m silently screaming them at her. But I don’t dare open my mouth. If the waterworks start, she wins.



‘Now,’ Mum continues, her voice still low and dangerous, ‘I’m not leaving here until I know that little girl is alive and well, because I just can’t trust you, my darling.’



‘Please, Mum.’ I choke out. Mum just smiles, then turns and starts back up the stairs. As soon as her back is turned, I slump against the banister. Of course she wins, she always wins. This was my chance to get away from her, if only for a while. Time for the house of cards to fall down.



Halfway up the staircase, Mum stops. She turns back to me, her face registering something like…disappointment? I search her face for some clue for what comes next. 



Just like that, the mask is back in place, and she sighs heavily. 



‘Well, I’m relieved.’ she says. ‘I don’t know what all the melodrama was about, Abby, I really don’t.’



I watch her in stunned silence. I can’t work out what just happened. Is this a trick? Is she trying to distract me so she can tackle me into submission? I step back as she descends down the stairs, just in case, but she moves past me, towards her bag and jacket. 



‘I have neither the time nor energy to go through this again, so you get your wish; I’ll leave you alone. Natasha will be pleased; she’s probably been feeling quite neglected with all the time I’ve spent worrying about you instead of looking after her. And in the state she’s in, too.’ she adds, reproachfully. 



Tash will definitely not be pleased. I’d gotten a mardy text from her a couple of days ago, sarcastically thanking me for freeing up so much of Mum’s time that she was now able to turn her attention on Natasha and her bump. Mum was never as awful to Tash as she was to me, not by a long shot, but it doesn’t mean she can stand her either. 



It takes another minute or so to usher Mum out the door, and my arm is itching to slam it in her face. Before she finally leaves, she tells me,



‘You know I’m proud of you, don’t you?’ 



It *hurts*. The insincerity, the gaslighting. The fact that despite everything, I *want* her to mean it. I roll my eyes to hide the tears welling up in them, and her lips purse. 



‘I think you should probably check on the baby.’ are her pointed, parting words. It takes every ounce of my mental fortitude to close the door without slamming it behind her.



I go to the couch, bury my face in Anna’s thickest, fluffiest cushion, and I scream and scream and scream. 



It’s the first night in this house that I don’t dream. 



\-



In the morning, I go to take a shower - I was instantly enamoured with the rainfall shower, and have been using it daily - but my hand falters on the tap. I’ve ignored the big, clawfoot bath under the window. I can’t even remember the last time I had a bath. It was CAMHS’ treatment of choice whenever I’d ring them for help, but the pokey little tub in Mum’s bathroom wasn’t so much a suicide deterrent as it was an inviting receptacle for a toaster. This, however, was a bath you got in for pleasure, not one you got crammed into with your sister after a muddy day at the park. There was a basket so chock-full of Lush bath bombs that I could take one without it being missed. And besides, hadn’t Anna told me to make myself at home? 



I use a bath bomb *and* bubble bath. They kind of cancel each other out, but the real luxury is being able to use either without Mum in my ear warning me about bacterial vaginosis. The bath is absolutely *steaming*, and I dip my fingers into the colourful, soapy surface. I snatch my hand back out. Of course, someone like Anna wouldn’t be relying on a crappy boiler that only got going once the bath was half-full. I brace myself and plunge my hand back in to pull out the plug, dousing my hand with the cold tap before I can feel the burn. 



While I leave the water to equalise to a more bearable temperature, I nip to the kitchen for a hot chocolate. I’ve well and truly given up on the coffee machine, but a hot bath and a fancy Whittard’s hot chocolate almost make the whole haunted doll thing worth it. I check my phone while the microwave heats up the milk, swiping away the message and voicemail notifications from Mum. She hates me giving her the cold shoulder; that’s *her* strategy. If I ring her back, she’ll start acting aloof; as if I’m not the one returning her call. She’ll string me along until I finally apologise, like I always do. But I don’t need her; I can handle this. I’m a fucking adult now; a fact I think she’d like me to forget sometimes. 



Mug in hand, I make my way back up to the bathroom. A few more minutes of twiddling with the taps, and I finally have a bath that’s a decent temperature. I slip into the water, and lean back against the sloped end of the bath. 



For a few minutes, it’s wonderful. Peaceful and warm, the concoction of bath products just short of being overwhelming. But then, I remember exactly why I stopped having baths. 



\-



I’m twelve years old and I’m staring at a pregnancy test I swiped from Boots; the cheap ones they don’t lock away in the cabinets. 



‘What does two lines mean?’ Elliot asks. Even at that age, in that moment, I recognise the irony of having to explain how a pregnancy test works to the grown man who’s made it necessary for me to use. 



‘Pregnant.’ I say. My voice doesn’t sound like mine. 



‘Check again.’ he says. 



‘What the fuck do you think’s going to change?’ I snap. ‘Two lines means pregnant, check it yourself.’ I pick the box up from the sink and throw it at him. I was so bold back then; I didn’t even care that it would probably earn me a slap. He doesn’t move, though, and the box hits him in the shoulder, before falling to the floor.



‘I can’t be a dad.’ he says blankly, and I let out a wordless shriek, pushing him out the door and slamming it in his face, my knickers still around my ankles. 



*I’ll kill you if you end up like me*, Mum had always said. I’ve beaten her record; pregnant two whole years younger than she was. The tummy ache I’ve been feeling for weeks straight is worse than ever. There’s a *baby* inside me. I want to vomit and vomit and vomit until it comes out, but even I’m old enough to know that’s not how it works. 



Naked from the waist down, I stand in the filthy bathroom and contemplate what comes next. 



I’ll get fat and throw up every morning. A great, disgusting whale that smells of sick and cries all the time. I have vague memories of Mum pregnant with Tash. She’d always been so glamorous and energetic, and suddenly she was this big, angry lump on the sofa, who never had the energy to wash herself or tidy up. For the first few months of her life, I hated Natasha for it. I used to give her little head or body a smack when Mum was out of the room. It didn’t matter; I always got shouted at when the baby started screaming; whether it had been my fault or not. 



I’ll have to stop going to school. I’ve only just been deemed cool enough to hang out with Daisy and the other girls; the bullying would be even worse than before. Not just a chav, not just a crybaby, but *worse.* All the names I’ve used on other girls I know; skank, slut, sket. Short, guttural words you can spit at someone, or hiss under your breath when they pass.



Elliot will go to prison. I can tell the police it wasn’t him, but Mum will sing like a canary once she knows her suspicions were true. She loves being right, much more than she loves me. I’ll get put into foster care; maybe Tash too. Besides, if one of Mum’s kids could go so astray, it must be her parenting. We’ll get dragged out of the house in front of the neighbours, and Mum will never talk to me again, even when I’m older, and the father of my child is a registered sex offender. 



Because then, there’s the baby. They’ll make me keep it, probably, like Lila from over the road did, even when they put her in the group home. I’ll have to feed it and bathe it and change its shitty nappies, and pretend that I love this creature that’s ruined my entire life. 



But I have options. Babies are delicate, even more so before they’re born. After all, Mum had tried her hardest to keep her pregnancy after Tash. She was determined not to have the same complications that had come up with baby number 2, so she ate healthy, rested as much as possible, and took so many pills and vitamins she could have run a pharmacy out of our medicine cabinet.



And it still died inside her. 



\-



I can hear a baby crying. 



I clamber out of the bath. All the therapy, all the medication, all the fucking *years*, and the memories are still vivid as day. I know better than to let myself go back there, but here I am; in a nice, head-clearing bath - like a clear head isn’t exactly what I always try to avoid. 



I don’t bother towelling myself off; I just pull last night’s knickers and t-shirt onto my wet skin. I hate the feeling, but it’s comfortingly distracting. The crying continues, needling its way into my head. I hum, trying to drown it out. It’s so lifelike - high-pitched and desperate, with a raw edge to the sound. 



It’s coming from the nursery.



I burst into the room, dripping water and bubbles all over the floor. The sound persists, seemingly muffled under the blanket that covers Ruthie. 



Five things I can see; blanket, crib. Don’t break down. Window. Four things I can touch; who cares? Three things I can hear; screaming. Why is the doll screaming? Dolls don’t scream. I can’t hear two other things, it’s just *screaming*, filling up my head until it’s about to explode. Screaming, my screaming this time. Do I sound scared or do I sound angry? I don’t know, I can’t think shut up shut up *shut up*.



I rip the blanket off, and the screaming stops. Mine and hers. But her plastic has turned to flesh, and it’s a real baby squirming under my horrified gaze. 



I know who’s haunting me, now. I never gave you a name. It would have made you real. But you’re not real; you’re a memory, and Ruthie is a doll. I know what you want, but I can’t give it to you. I pick Ruthie up by her onesie; I couldn’t bear to feel skin instead of plastic. She dangles in my hand as I take her through to the bathroom. 



I remember your face - eyes blinking up at me from the bottom of the toilet bowl. Your little mouth opening and closing for a moment before I flushed you away; like you were trying to form the word *mama*. Of course; you didn’t have a face. You couldn’t have been more than 7 weeks of growth - you weren’t baby-shaped yet, just a clump of blood and tissue, like everyone says. But I saw you clearly, a fully-grown newborn with tiny fingers that reached for me. And I pulled the chain. 



I’m sorry, but you’re going back into the water. It’s where you belong. At least the bath probably smells nicer. This whole house seems to reek of rotten milk.



\-



I climb back into the spare bed, still naked and dripping wet. I don’t feel tired, or scared; I don’t feel anything. Just a slight ringing in my ears from the screams. Maybe I sleep. More likely, I stare at a blank wall for hours on end.  



\-



The sun is setting by the time I finally drag myself out of bed. My hair feels neither dry nor wet, but some stiff, greasy combination of the two. I feel empty. Physically empty - I haven’t put anything in my body since the two sips of cocoa I managed before my bath - but also spiritually empty; exorcised. I wish it felt like a relief, to have the metaphorical monkey off my back, but there’s a creeping dread I have to push down; like I’ve lost some vital part of myself. 



Ruthie is still floating in the bath; plastic once more. I pick her up and hold her to my chest in some ghoulish parody of skin-to-skin contact. I just hold her and rock my body from side to side, water running down in rivulets between my breasts.



‘Sorry.’ I mumble to her.



I’m not ready to live on my own; that much is clear. I’ll finish out the week, then tell Mum I’m sorry, and can I stay in my room? She’ll pretend to be annoyed, or disappointed, but secretly, she’ll be glad. Things are always good for a while once I’ve admitted that I need her. She’ll remind me to take my medication more regularly, and I’ll go back to the bland, agreeable shell of a person I’ve been until recently. Turns out that *is* the better-case scenario.



I carefully dress Ruthie in the prettiest dress I can find in her tiny wardrobe, and tuck her into her crib. I even press a kiss to her tiny, plastic head. Then, I go back to bed.

He said he was dying to finally visit New York and try an authentic chopped cheese.

I had no idea what he was talking about at the time, and consulted with my friend who grew up in the Bronx and has lived in the the city her whole life, and she also had no idea what I was talking about. Specifically she said “WTF is a chopped cheese?!”

Fast forward, I see signs for chopped cheese constantly, and random internet things talking about how iconic it is. 

I’m honestly really bothered by this. How could it be possible that I’d never one registered the existence of what is supposed to be a ‘NYC famous food’ in 20 years? Maybe I’ve blown up in my mind that it’s as iconic as pizza, and it’s really not that big of a deal?

Maybe it’s possible I just never noticed it because it’s probably not something I would order?

Just wanted to hear some thoughts if anyone else just…does not remember ever hearing anything about a chopped cheese until relatively recently? 

I would rather not hear how stupid and oblivious I am, but I am mentally preparing for it.

Entry 1

I worked at a government testing facility. I ran away, leaving my coworkers to clean up the mess. I will not disclose the details of this site, as even if I wanted to host some kind of inspirational raid to stop the atrocities taking place there, you lot wouldn’t get past the first gate. The more details I unveil, the more likely this post will be swiftly covered up and dealt with, as well as my existence. Just assume these are the ramblings of a mad man. This is less of an exposé piece and more of a confessional, praying it may abstain me of my sins. I’m not a religious man but I now know there are things beyond this world, or at the very least, our understanding of it, so I might as well try and cover ass.

I also think it wants me to tell you all about it... I’m not sure. I haven’t been the same since. A throbbing pain permeates inside my skull, clouding my thoughts. It’s a constant pressure from within, sitting behind my eyes, travelling all the way through to the back of my head, caressing me as it fades down my spine. It’s consistency and my nebulous mind has created a constant brain fog, so forgive me if my writing is nonsensical at any point. Again, ramblings of a mad man.

I’ve seen my fair share of horrible things. To be honest, we’re not entirely ethically sound there. The workers’ silent motto is “the ends justify the means”. It helps us all sleep at night if we think we’re doing something for the greater good at the end of the day, finding comfort in some self-imposed moral ambiguity. Yet no amount of mental gymnastics can excuse what we’ve done.

August 19th, a team debrief was held to establish understanding of our next project. Bright and early in the morning my four other colleagues and I filed into the observation room, its interior white like sugar - glistening, pristine surfaces covering every square inch. We gather in the corner, beside the hissing coffee machine, in a queue waiting for our turn. A window into the world we would watch daily filled the wall opposite us. Our debriefer followed us in and stood in front of it. The window and him separated by our workstations, long tables connected and covered in computers and stationery. At first glance it hardly resembled a research lab, more akin to an interrogation room.

Our debriefer read from a clipboard, barely able to see past the mounds of eye bags that rest between his tired gaze and his reading material, droned on about a new, experimental, “revolutionary”, form of communication, lips loose as each word fell out of his mouth. Not a single person in the room was convinced; we all just took notes and followed along begrudgingly like anyone on a Monday morning would. The debriefer looked like Monday morning incarnate. Craig, the man on my right, letting out sigh as he wrote, the woman on my left was visibly rolling her eyes. I’d worked with this team before, some members more than others, and we were no strangers to failed experiments. In fact, I used to work with Craig a lot, and at one point, I even considered him a friend. In recent years, Craig has endured a melancholic depression due to the passing of his wife years ago. Suicide.

Suddenly, what felt like an encore of my morning alarm shook me to attention, waking me more than its predecessor. However, this alarm took the form of a mess of a professor bursting through the door, almost crashing into our desks, then steadying himself as he stood next to our debriefer. A flurry of emotions spewed from this man's demeanor, from frustration to excitement to exhaustion to... paranoia? He was a mess. Untucked shirt, titled glasses, messy hair. He had the eyes of a man lacking sleep, as well as the desire to do so. Yet his chin held so high all he could do is look down on us. As if he could grace the gods themselves. He did not have an ego or high self-esteem. His sin was the pride he had for his work.

“This is no ordinary communication technique!” He announced, emphasizing his words with dramatic hand movements. “Listen well please. I have designed a quick procedure that alters minds. You can think of it as a form of mental walkie-talkie, if you wish to keep your view skewed, just know that it is so much more than that. They have unlocked, um-” a brief pause, lost in thought. “No, actually, I won't get into the details.” He stammered. He went on, and during his tirade our previous debriefer and this raving loon had come to a non-verbal agreement that the old debriefers' work here was done, as he handed over his clipboard and shambled out of the room.

“All I need from you all is to follow the tests I put in your mission outlines and take extremely detailed notes.” The professor said. He walked to the door, this time much calmer and purposeful. “Telepathy people. This is telepathy.” He said over his shoulder on his way out. I now notice that the room's tone had shifted to curious and awake. He couldn’t be serious, right? Maybe he put receivers in these poor people's brains that read their thoughts and sent them to the others. Yet somehow the way he’s talking about it makes it seem worse and more complicated than that. Telepathy? This building is for science, not magic.

All we could do as a team was share a few confused glances before our mission began. Five people, each wearing button up shirts with their allocated number, entered the room beyond the glass wall. Their new home was big enough to comfortably fit them all, full of beds, two private bathrooms in the back-end corners of the room, male and female, a dining table and chairs, and a shelf of reading material present opposite the door they came in. We were to watch these people through our one-sided window for an undisclosed amount of time. And they had “telepathy”. “Ridiculous” was the conclusion I came to.

As I’m recounting my experiences here, I’ve realized that my head is spinning, and the sweat is starting to pool at the base of my keyboard. I wish none of this was true, I wish to return home, I wish to not know what I know. It terrifies me. Anxiety is swelling up in my throat. I feel as though I’ve drunk enough to cause a night full of regret. And it's all beginning to bubble over. The room is shifting and rotating like I’m a lost sock in a broken washing machine filled with shit. My heart sinks below the floorboards of the filthy shack that I've found myself in. Even below the surface I can feel it pounding and urging me to stay alert. Eyes are on me. I’m surrounded by whispering voices that want in, but I won’t let them get to me. Bangs on the door rattle through my ear drum, piercing my skull with each thump, and I feel as though I’m going to collapse. I heave and I heave but nothing leaves me. No barf. No breath. Only desperate wheezes.

Until it stops.

I haven’t drunk a drop of liquor. My room is clean, as it should be. I’m alone, no whispers, no banging. Its ok. I’m ok.

But it feels close.

I’ll continue retelling my story tomorrow.



**03/04/25 – 1300 hours**

Entry 2

Whatever “procedure” the professor spoke of earlier had already taken place. All that was left was to test and observe.

The first few days were boring and normal. They all engaged in small talk and got to know each other. A young Korean girl, maybe in her early twenties (She was labelled number 1 on her uniform), confided with a single mother from Bangladesh, she had the most caring eyes and had a strong maternal instinct (number 2). A shorter Caucasian man, (3) was telling an equally short, older uncle from Singapore (4) about his gambling troubles (the reason he’s here). The Singaporean listened intently and tried to give advice with his hands comfortably sitting behind his back. The gambler did not listen in return, only vented. A tall African American man (5) immediately inspected the collection of reading material on the shelves. He seemed quiet and was by far the most physically fit in the group.

Their life details and anything that may be important are in our files. We were encouraged to still use their numbers, not their names. According to our records these were test subjects, not people, it’s almost barbaric. A lot of people here only saw them as such, subjects that aided in the advancement of, well, whatever the government wished to advance, I suppose. Craig was always against this. Made him furious that they “weren't even granted the basic human decency to have a name.” Even now, I can't remember their names.

*Test 1-*

It was simple. We ask them to briefly tell us how they’re feeling, what they’re thinking about, then to think of something specific.

Korean girl (1) was first-

“okay”, “home”.

“Think of sunflowers.” Craig spoke to them through a speaker.

Bangladesh woman (2)-

“tired”, “my children”, again, told to think of sunflowers.

By this point we’d forgotten the professor's speech, and the drawl of work took us over again, sifting through tests and notes as our tasks wore on.

The gambler (3)-

“bored”, “money,” sunflowers.

Singaporean uncle (4)-

“Huh? Oh! Happy"", “my new friends.” Sunflowers.

The fit dark-skinned man (5)-

“intrigued”, “your book collection.” Sunflowers.

We then went on to record their brain activity, blood pressure, etc. All baseline stuff. We repeated these tests every three hours for the first day with no noteworthy results. At 2200 hours our coworker, Dylan, a gruff man and a heavy cynic, grabbed the microphone to speak to our guests.

“Do any of you feel anything worth noting?” He grumbled past his thick beard.

“... I’m tired of thinking about sunflowers. hahaha” the Singaporean uncle chimed.

“Do the rest of you feel this way?” Dylan asked the room. His question was answered with shrugs and silence. After a sigh he asked “Hear any... voices? In your head that... aren’t your own?”

He was jumping a bit forward. These tests were specifically structured. We weren’t sure how much the patients knew of what the results of the procedure were, but I knew he was not supposed to ask that. I suppose it didn’t matter as his question was once again greeted by a confused silence. “Typical.” Dylan huffed, off mic, to only himself, I suppose. He walked away and promptly clocked off for the night. Dylan would be in deep shit once this got out, the higher ups are very particular. He was prone to frustrated out bursts at tests he thought were a waste of time.

“What do you mean “voices”?” The tall number 5 asked. We had no answer to give to our neighbors on the other side of the window, so we gave no answer. Anything outside of taking notes and tests was above our pay grade anyway, so we all began packing up and clocking out too.

Gabriella, Craig, and I were the last to leave. Gabriella was shy and thorough with her notes, so she stayed a while to revise and observe at her station. She was deep in her files like a cave diver dislocating themselves just to enter a virgin passage, a hair tie holding back her deep brunette hair from hindering her work. She only halted every now and then to push up her thick framed glasses. I was tired and made myself another coffee on my way out, Craig joined me, though we didn’t speak, so I passed silent glances between Gabriella, the test subjects, and my feet, as if they were playing some invisible three-way tennis match. We, the lucky few, witnessed their first signs. “Stupid sunflowers.” The Korean girl, the gambler, and the Singaporean uncle moaned in unison. They looked at each other confused, as did we. They began a debate on coincidence or not. An hour of overtime note taking and observing, and the rest of us window watchers were able to head home.

This was the first time they did that, spoke in unison I mean, lord knows it's not the last.

I can still hear their synchronized groans.

I need a drink before I think about this anymore. My heart rate is through the roof. Maybe writing this was a bad idea.



**03/06/25 – 0240 hours**

Entry 3

I forgot to write today (yesterday?). Forgetting feels nice. Easily achievable with the appropriate amount of pain killers and alcohol. I’ve made sure to stock my temporary motel room with said supplies and spent the day partaking in them. It doesn’t help the dizziness, but I finally feel mental quiet and physical numbness.

I don’t know why I’m even hiding. Why I’m jumping from motel to motel. It could find me if it wants. I’m sure if anyone else from my old job was looking for me, they’d find me too.

It just feels right. To run. It's all I can do.

I’m sorry, Craig, if you're out there. I didn’t mean for this to happen. Any of it.

That last look you gave me will haunt me the most.



**03/06/25 – 1840 hours**

Entry 4

Day two of the experiment wasn’t noteworthy, except for the fact that Dylan didn’t come in. In fact, he never came in again. Who knows if he got fired or if another terrible fate befell him. We went on as usual, though. Test, watch as their food is delivered and eaten, test, watch, test. More baselines, asking them how they’re feeling, etc., etc.

In-between tests I tried to make small talk mixed with half assed attempts at humor with Craig and the rest of the crew. “Lovely day for it, huh?” knowing we’d be inside our windowless box all day, the weather not affecting us in the slightest. I don’t think they heard me, because they didn’t laugh. Gabriella buried herself in her work, the woman I don't know the name of would give one-word answers out of politeness but clearly did not want to be spoken to (I did learn her name was Alexa though). And Craig, well, the usual, barely receiving eye contact let alone a conversation. His eyes were sunken and soulless, and he’d lost the extra weight he had around him and then some. He’s still torn up inside over what happened. Does he know it eats away at me too? Or does he sense me as the catalyst? I don’t know what led us to continue to work here, but here we are, the invisible hand of fate guiding us along.

I stewed in my own anguish for most of that day. Silent crew, lack luster results, Craig, all of it was dragging me down. At the time I remember wanting nothing more than a drink, but my 2-month company mandated sobriety streak loomed over me, so a coffee would have to suffice.

The professor snapped me out of my mental crisis with yet another unannounced intrusion.

“After receiving your reports yesterday, I updated your work outline. I’m aware that there are cameras that are monitored, and the recordings are checked, however, I have brought up the possibility of 24-hour personnel monitoring with the higher ups, and they seem to agree.” This alone would’ve brought my blood pressure up another notch, resulting in a very good reason to break my sobriety. If it weren’t for his next sentence, that worsened things still. “So, if anything... happens, we have eyewitnesses. They called me mad, but I already know this will be a great success.” This man and his cryptic nonsense were going to send me over the edge today.

“Are you going to explain a single thing to us? How can we do our job without the facts? Now we’re supposed to monitor them 24/7?” I hissed through clenched teeth, stress weighing on me.

“We don’t know the details of what happened to these people or what will happen. Do they even know?” Craig announced, stepping forward. Craig was a selfless, soft man. He wasn’t even surprised about the extra hours, he just wants to help these people. Looking at him, I noticed that he’d turned pale.

“We’re getting paid overtime for this right?” Alexa added.

“Yes, yes. Please trust me, we will get to all that soon. In the meantime, ... Do your fucking jobs.” The Professors smiley answer turned to a spit and a snarl. On his way out, he mentioned one last thing over his shoulder. “You will be paid double for this of course.”

We apparently need the money just as much as the people beyond the glass because at the end of the day we’re all still here. Exiting our observation room, at the end of the hall, past the locked door of the test subjects, is our new home, fitted with beds, a kitchen, a bathroom and of course a full camera monitoring set up so we can continue our work, day in, day out. We were only allowed in this room outside of regular working hours. Anyone not agreeing to these terms and who wants to go home was instructed to do so but not to return.



**03/07/25 - 1250 hours**

Entry 5

There was a knock at my door last night, at least I think there was. Of course I didn’t answer, I didn’t even have the courage to get out of bed. It came during my extensive nightly attempt to sleep after my last entry. Just three quick taps of my motel door, a fair few feet away from me and instantly my breath was caught in my chest, I was unable to move a muscle. Like stone, like I wasn’t even alive, I lay there unmoving, waiting. Waiting for what, I don’t know, but the lord knows I waited. Waiting while the room is filled with nothing but the ticking clock above my head, heart lurching with every tick. And dread. The room was filled with dread, up to the brim. My ears catching every sound, I swear I could hear my own blood pump and yet I couldn’t tell if my heart was as still as I was or if it was fluttering and fleeing the confines of my ribcage. It must have been hours before I almost had the courage to shuffle an inch again. Alas, before my freedom was granted, another knock came. Another quick three taps. How could this be? The exact same knock, hours apart. I was surely hearing things again, I must be. But this felt so real, and my delusions come in quick intense spats, not this prolonging torture.

Was it there? On the other side of the door. Waiting as I too am waiting. Still, as I too am still! Barely breathing as I too am barely breathing! I must be going mad. I can’t take this anymore, I thought. Now I knew for certain that my heart was racing, pumping, pounding! I was about to get up. Dear god I was actually about to go face this thing. Launch from my bed and lunge at the door, a desperate attack, an attempt better than nothing. Better than laying here for eternity. A clashing of symbols, an impact of a waterfall, a climax of an explosion, a RUSH. Fighting the bed sheets that engulfed me, I escaped my own mental restraints and sprinted for the door. Before even a blink could arrive, I did. Right at the door. Fate on the other side.

Of course it was empty. Of course nothing was there. I stood with the door swung open and nothing but cool air brushing against me like a mother caressing and calming a child. As I began to close the door, as it slid past my face and almost shut, I saw it.

A letter sat at my feet.



**03/08/25 - 1652 hours**

Entry 6

By now it was August 28th, and we had adjusted to our living standards quickly. Alexa and Gabriella got along well, sharing notes, theories, and even started talking about their personal lives. Gabriella wanted to start her own lab and studies. Me and Craig even began to talk. Small talk and work talk but still talk.

I pushed open the door to our main observation room that morning, balancing a paper cup filled with coffee. Craig was already there, leaning against the counter, staring through the glass.

“Morning,”.

Craig snorted. “Barely. You look like you lost a fight with your alarm clock.”

“I did,” I replied. “It won by a landslide.”

“Good to see you’re still getting your sleep”

I scoffed. “I wouldn’t say that”

“Struggling huh?” He took a sip from his own coffee. “Yeah, me too. If they’re going to force us to sleep here, they could at least give us some half decent mattresses.”

We shared a chuckle, even though we both knew the mattresses weren’t the issue. Then we went to work. We had a routine and things were nice. The subjects reported nothing more than difficulty sleeping, increased appetite and a small amount of anxiety, all of which could be attributed to their environment, so we brought in some requested items for each of them. The Bangladesh woman requested a photo of her family, the Singaporean uncle requested a potted plant, the gambler wanted his marriage ring (he was divorced), the African American man wanted a book from home, and the Korean girl shyly requested her bear plushy, said it helped her sleep.

It was going smoothly. Those were the best days of the experiment. The last good day of our lives.

“What’d you say?” The gambler said as he got up from his bed. Confused glances spread throughout their room as we, the watchers, leaned forward at our workstations.  “Don’t act dumb! What did you say? I “stink”?!” He said something along those lines. This time he received a series of “Huh's” and “what’s”, confusion and tension growing. His gaze was locked onto the Korean girl sitting on the floor with her bear plushy. Her innocence radiated from her, yet the gambler was in denial. He approached her and swiftly yanked her bear away from her.

“I didn’t say shit, you freak!” She screamed in retaliation. “You do stink though.” she grumbled under her breath. This girl was usually quiet, for such a sudden outburst the plushy must’ve meant a lot to her. She couldn’t have been younger than 19 yet she clung to it like a child. By this escalation, the rest of the room began defending the girl.

“What? No, I’m not crazy... I-” he said with shaky breaths as he held his head with one hand and the bear with the other. “No. No! I know what this is. This isn’t how it was meant to be. He said it was like a walkie-talkie! We can just turn it off. Why are you able to hear what I think without my consent! Why can I hear you all! Judging me!” he shouted, fear in his voice, holding the bear high.

*Test 2-*

Craig once again had control of the microphone as he instructed the room to calm down and return the girl's belongings to her. They were told to sit on their respective beds and listen.

“Number one, I need you to focus. Please tell us what you're thinking,” Craig asked.

“I want to go home. Are you sure I’ll be safe in here?” The girl said. Her rage had subsided and was replaced with a growing fear.

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking"" Craig visibly gulped down his empathy as he forced himself to ignore the girl's question and follow the script in our work outline.

“No, I have no idea what they’re thinking.” She responded.

“Number two, what are you thinking about?” Craig continued.

“I think Number three should be removed from this experiment after that outburst.” The Bangladesh woman confessed, her motherly instincts most likely wanted to take care of our youngest guest.

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking,"" Craig repeated. After some deep thought, she had an answer for this seemingly silly question.

“I think... someone is thinking of sunflowers again.”

“Number three-” Craig began.

“This is bullshit” The gambler cut off the voice echoing out of the speaker. “And I think someone wants their bear back” he continued. Odd, since the girl already had her bear plushy returned to her.

“Number four.”

“Well, uh, I must admit I was thinking of sunflowers.” The old Singaporean sat, staring at the Bangladesh woman who stared back. “I think she’s thinking of her children.”

“Number five.”

“I... want my bear back...” The tall intimidating African American man sat so smally as he said this, staring at his hands and hunched over.

Even if lagyan mo pa ng extras to make it lighter, if they want to carry it with care and with peace, they would.

I ordered an Iced Vanilla Oat Latte recently. It's something na I've always wanted to try again after years of trying to control caffeine. I held myself back at first.

""Kaya ko ba 'to? Baka sobrang tapang and hindi pala ok. Sobrang risky but I've been seeing it on the menu for years and maybe this time, it's worth the try ulit.""

The first sip was so strong. It's like being high in sugar na you just want to consume forever and hope it never runs out. I was a complete person myself, but it made me feel complete-r. Diba OA? Haha.

The second sip was stronger. I was already making plans in my head. Maybe a bigger cup would be better next time. Maybe I can add another shot and maybe whipped cream on top, for sure magiging ok pa lalo.

I stared at my half-consumed cup. Hindi ko narealize na I was already halfway. I didn't listen to the barista saying na to ""take it slow"" when it was handed over to me. Sure, in the back of my head, I was already foreseeing some bad effects. I knew the caffeine withdrawal is going to be messy af. But I ignored it knowing this isn't the first time anyway. I can always go back tomorrow and order another.

I got to the last few sips not knowing they were the last. The ice cubes hit my skin. Sobrang lamig pero sige lang, it's just ice.

Pero yun na pala yun.

I asked the barista if I can get a refill in the same cup. Sabi ko pa nga na I'm willing to pay naman.

""Last order na yan, ma'am. We're closing na. It's 10pm."" He said in a very stern voice like as if he's just waiting for me to leave so they can close.

Na-off guard ako kasi he was friendly and chatty pa naman kanina. But then I thought he got to sell another cup.. so I guess his job is done. He's just doing what he intended to do. ""Ay sorry, akala ko kasi open kayo til midnight."", I responded then left.

That night, I almost pleaded but hindi na nga pala ako yun. Ang babaw pero I know this time I gotta give myself some self-respect. The right barista will not make you feel confused or give you doubts. They will always make time and not make you feel like you're an inconvenience. You wouldn't need to apologize and shedding a bit of vulnerability would be like waiting for you to decide on what croissant you'd want with your coffee and they would still take your order with a genuine smile. It's basic human decency.

The coffee was great but the service was not. Marami pang coffee shops around and I know they'd be willing to take orders anytime, baka with free 2 croissants pa nga and not just one.

I honestly wish I never did any of this but I'm kind of glad that I finally got the closure na I've always wanted. I can be upset, tell them very mean things, scream at them, but I won't.

The world needs more kindness than anger and they probably need it more than I do.

To you: I hope we both heal, grow, and find the things that will truly make us happy. I mean this in the kindest way possible I know how but if you ever get to see this, please don't ever reach out to me again. Don't even bother composing a reply because it was never an option for you when I asked for one.

You did the same thing to me once and you did it again.. but worse this time around.

Despite all this, I'm not going to blame you for not showing up because I will always understand why but then again, whatever song you decide to play next, I wish it's a rhythm that will always remind you of why you chose to say ""habambuhay"" when it's not.",1,1763122580.0,u_matchamilktea_,0,1.0,False

I am having trouble extracting consistently, same grind size I am having sometimes a spray going from the group head to the machine (you can see some splash on it) and although it looks good to me the same setup sometimes is perfect and this time for example got 69 grams for 20 grams of coffee over 30 seconds but just the extraction before this one it was 49 grams with the exact same process (only the puck is different).

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Palworld and Ark ASA. Just bought Dinkum, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

1owuw5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1owuw5g/how_to_be_a_good_flatmate_in_uni/,How to be a good flatmate in uni,"Hi, so I'm 26, a bit older now and more mature, and I see a lot of posts about people struggling with first-year politics with their flatmates. Almost every time I come on here, I see patterns I used to fall into when I was a student, but I’ve since learned better ways of dealing with things. I hope to pass on some of the knowledge I’ve gained from living in professional flatshares and staying in many Airbnbs while I was between work after doing 4 years at uni. My Airbnb rating is 100% 5\* lol and I always get on with anyone I live with - but in first year at uni I was the shy loner who wouldn’t come out of his room. I would avoid the kitchen, feel like people didn’t “get” me, built up quiet resentment, and never really knew how to connect or build relationships. Being the first person in my family to go to uni, I lacked any guidance, and my parents weren’t exactly supportive (they were more annoyed that I was moving away than proud).

The main thing I’ve learned over the years is people skills - understanding how to work with different personalities. When you’re young and have just left home, you’re often subconsciously looking for the family environment you once had, so your judgement is shaped by trying to find that north star again. Some people get lucky and find it quickly; others don’t, and they end up feeling confused, left out, or worse, like they are the problem.

The biggest skill to learn to beat all of this, in my view, is reciprocity. You have to give things to people for them to give things back to you. I don’t mean being overly generous or spoiling people with gifts, it’s about doing things that are genuinely and obviously helpful without expecting anything in return. It’s compassion, care, empathy, and trusting that people will return these things in their own way.

You do small favours for your flatmates: buy milk one day, make them a cup of tea without being asked, pick up flowers or decorations for the shared kitchen, remember their birthdays and leave a note, take the bins out and clean up - not because it’s “your turn” but because you want the space to feel better. The beautiful thing about reciprocity is that it almost always comes back in unexpected and amazing ways. It becomes a kind of feedback loop: you start by buying each other milk, and a month later you’re getting creative and surprising each other with little thoughtful things, like a funny coffee mug.

I once bought my friend a gingerbread man from Co-op for 85p -- it even smashed in my bag on the way home and I gave her it broken into 6 pieces -- and yet she appreciated it so much she got me a tiny Jellycat cherry plush and one of those “paint your own mug” kits. We ended up having a really cool evening making them together, and I still have the mug and plushy to this day.

I promise you, the best relationships start by recognising how to plant those small seeds of reciprocity. It can even begin with genuine compliments -- giving someone confidence, validating their thoughts, praising how hard they’re studying, or openly appreciating their fashion. Not flattery - just genuinely giving out good energy.

And you can do it the other way around too: ask people for small favours. A great one is knocking on their door and asking if they have any spare paper for you to use. It gets people to plant seeds of reciprocity in you, and it opens up the relationship so both of you feel comfortable asking and giving. Life is already pretty hard, nobody wants it to get harder because they ran out of shampoo or forgot an ingredient for dinner.

Flatmates and the people you live with can become amazing long-term relationships that genuinely enrich your life. :)",4,1763122472.0,UniUK,0,0.75,False
