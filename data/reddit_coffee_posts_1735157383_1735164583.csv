And it will always be with her.","I dont know if this is the correct place to write this but i really need to get this out of my chest

Hello. This is the first time I'm writing here, so I hope I'm not breaking any rules. Sorry mods if I do.  
I hope you're all well. This is my story. I just want to get it off my chest before everything collapses inside of me.  
This story took place on the harshly beautiful island of Folegandros. I was a chef at a small hotel. She was the daughter of the manager and a waitress at the restaurant of the hotel.

I'm 31 years old. Ten years ago, I had my first relationship. Kind of late to the party, I guess.  
We met at work. She was the daughter of the manager. At the time, she was 18, and I was 21 (it is legal in my country, Greece). We were working together, and she made something click inside of me, I guess.  
I'm a shy guy, kind of close to myself, and never really made a move on her. One day at work, something fell into my arm and kind of broke my pinky finger. I worked through it, but once the service was done, I went to a private place because I couldn't handle the pain anymore and didn't want to show the rest of the staff that I was in so much pain.  
She looked for me and brought me ice. That was the first time I talked to her a bit more outside of the usual friendly chat between coworkers. She caressed my hand and told me I needed a doctor. I said I was fine and told her not to worry. She stayed with me for 10-15 minutes, and after, we had to go back to work.  
All this time, she was pressing my hand with the ice. I felt great emotionally.  
For the first time, I was in love.

After a few days, I got the courage and messaged her on Facebook at 2 o'clock in the night:

""what are you doing awake at this hour?""  
She replied:  
HER: ""I just got out of the shower, what about you?""  
ME: ""I was thinking that I never said thank you for the other night.""  
HER: ""Well, better late than never."" (It's something we say in Greece.)  
ME: ""Want to go for a coffee in the morning?""  
HER: ""I have to be at the reception desk in the morning, but I'm free at night after the restaurant closes.""  
ME: ""So, wanna go for a drink to 'xxxxxx'?""  
HER: ""Of course.""  
We chatted a bit more through messages and eventually said goodnight to one another.  
The next day, I saw her at her desk as I was going to the restaurant to prepare breakfast for the hotel guests. We both had an idiotic smile on our faces.  
The hours passed really fast, and eventually, we finished work. At 11 o'clock at night, we were both in our rooms getting ready. I still remember how anxious I was, even though this was supposed to be just friends having drinks.  
We arrived at the bar, and I remember that she sat first on one side of the couch, and I sat on the other side, far away. About three more people could fit between us to sit. I was afraid. We had two cocktails, and two more after that, chatted a lot, and after some time, she told me to come and sit near her while laughing at the fact that I was so far away. After a few minutes, my heart was pumping so hard and fast. I eventually got the courage to touch her hand, and once I did, she shouted ""FINALLY,"" smiled at me sweetly, and we kissed.  
I will skip the part of our relationship. Things were great for both of us.  
Nine months later, difficult circumstances on both our sides made things extremely tough on us. My dad had cancer, and she had to study for university. We had no time for each other. Eventually, we ended the relationship. I was devastated. But I found joy in knowing that now she would have time to succeed in her life.  
Anyway, as time went by, her image and her aura, let's say, never left my head, but I was dealing with it somewhat with help from a close friend of mine.  
But EVERY DAY was a struggle emotionally.

We met again 5 years later. I was with another girl, and she was with another man. I was working at the same place, and she came for work as well. I knew she would eventually come, and I was confident that I would be cool with it.  
The moment I saw her, my insides became lava. My eyes teared up, and I had a burning sensation to just hug her as hard as I could. It wasn‚Äôt something sexual. I just wanted to feel her in my arms again. Anyway, we chatted a bit and went on our way.  
After a few days of working with her and my girlfriend at the time (she is my wife now) at the same place, I became a bit more relaxed, and things were well. One night, all the staff decided to go for drinks. So, about 15 people, we went to a bar and had some nice drinks. At one point, I got a bit emotional and wanted to leave. I said goodnight to everyone and left the place. My mind was so out of place, I didn‚Äôt kiss my girlfriend goodnight.  
My girlfriend (we were together for about a month at the time) came to my place afterward. She was sad, but eventually, we talked it through. I said I was sorry, explained to her what was happening, and she just hugged me and said, ""It's okay.""  
A few days later, I needed a lift to work, and the only one with a car was my ex. She told me to get breakfast before leaving to catch up. I told this to my girlfriend, and she said, ""As long as you trust yourself to not betray me, go ahead.""  
We went for breakfast at a cute place and had a chat. We discussed why we ended the relationship. She told me that she was sorry and regretted it. She told me that if I came back to the island the next year, she would still want to get together with me again. She told me that if we weren't in a relationship right now, she would hop into my hug the moment she saw me.  
I can't describe what I felt at the time. I was happy and sad.  
Days, weeks, and months passed, and the summer season ended. We parted ways.

Fast forward, 5 years later, my girlfriend is now my wife, and we just had our newborn daughter. She is one month old. I love them both.

About one week ago, I saw her(my ex) in my dreams. She was crying a lot and looking at me with her hand towards me as if she was trying to reach me. I was trying to run to her and tell her that everything was going to be alright, but the more I ran, the further away she was getting. I woke up in a sweat and trembling. Ever since that day, I‚Äôve had the same dream almost every night. I have this burning desire now to message her and ask, ""How are you, etc.?"" but I haven't done it.

Four days ago, I saw her on an Instagram story holding a gift from one of her friends, saying ""MAMA"" or in other words, ""MOM."" She is pregnant. I'm happy for her. Honestly, I want all the best for her and all her family. I wanted to message her to congratulate her, but I didn‚Äôt do it. I thought it would be weird.

I feel as if no matter what I do in my life, a big part of me will always be with her, for her.

1hma3wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1hma3wf/pain_after_fillings_been_a_month/,"Pain after fillings, been a month","1 month ago to the day I got three fillings done.  One on a molar and one on each side of two teeth , the one tooth over from the fang.

After it was done I did feel like the top tooth between the teeth felt like a lot of the tooth was shaved off.  I also had some sensitivity and strange pressure in top of gums (not near tooth).  Didn't think much of it.

Fast forward and even eating sweet on the opposite side of my mouth will send both teeth into a tails pin (i dont even think about eating on the teeth that got done).  Can't do soda, coffee, cookie etc.  Same burning in gums above the teeth that had filling in middle.  The molar is still sensitive to cold and so is the other tooth.  My dentist is closed completely until January 6th.  I did go to another dentist and they said nothing really showed on xray and CT.  

Personally it feels nerve related.  Going into jaw sometimes opposite side of where the teeth even are.  It does hurt badly.  The top where the filling is between teeth I can see some prominent veins in gums but the redness does remain way up in gums and not by tooth.

I am on the mini pill which causes my teeth to be more sensitive and do clench my teeth at night but can anyone tell me what they feel here?  For record too I have never had problems with any fills and never had a root canal before.

1hma2g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hma2g7/aita_for_feeling_like_my_mother_ruined_christmas/,Aita for feeling like my mother ruined christmas?,"I (40f) made christmas plans with my parents (66f) (68m)for them to come over for both Christmas eve and Christmas day. Christmas day they would stay until 3 pm because they had a 3 and a half hour ride home.  A few days before christmas eve my sister (33f) (we haven't been on best terms) asked my mother what her plans were. My mother told me, so despite our strained relationship (figured it's time to let things go and make peace) I said I would invite her for christmas day and did. She said yes and the plans were made. Fast forward to christmas eve everything went smooth. We were originally going to do Chinese for dinner but changed it once my sister was coming over because my parents said they would treat but changed it to me going half. (not my sister) We ended up buying a bunch of food to cook instead since that would be nicer. My parents stayed in a hotel that is what they like to do. The following day is where the disaster began. My parents were suppose to come at 9 am as the kids (19f,11m,8f,7f,) were waiting for them to open their presents under the tree and my mom loves watching and being involved. At 10 am and this is where all started I informed my mother that my sister would not be making it over because her partner was ill throwing up since 4 am. I thought it was best since she was also nauseous (though not throwing up) she stay home and we make plans for day when they aren't feeling ill. Mind you at this point it's been an hour and my mom had not even reached out to me about being late or anything.  My mother totally lost it and flipped out on me. She went off the handle screaming on the phone how she was just going to go home. I ended the call here. A few minutes later she kept repeatedly calling me, my husbasnd and daughter, I didn't answer because I was trying to enjoy christmas with my kids. Like 15 min later i called my father because I felt at this point she was out of line and I had every right to inform my sister it's best since their sick that they stay home. Again I hear my mother immediately yelling again. My father tells me they have to come to my house because after an hour of driving around no restaurants were open and my mom needed to eat. It's a routine for them they always get breakfast out before coming to our house when they stay a night. My mother just likes eating out and uses any reason to do so even though I'm perfectly capable and willing to make food. So I agree and let her come. Apparently they stopped at 7 11 to get eggs as if I didn't have any... I really don't know why she does these things it's kind of insulting. So they both eat and she was upset the kids already opened the gifts when she said she wasnt coming, and then rushes to leave so they can get home by 4 for my sister to instead come to their house. Basically just blowing me and my family off leaving us with no christmas plans. They left in such a rush my oldest didn't even get to give her her christmas gift.  My oldest whose 19 was upset my younger kids were upset too. I felt this was extremely disrespectful and rude. I feel like they just came to eat and take thier chicken back that was going to be cooked today and take left over ham for my sister. And all of this because I didn't want someone knowingly sick in my house. So instead of staying until 3 on christmas day and arriving at 9 am they rushed to leave and left by 11ish am and first arrived 10 30 ish. She also had already celbrated the holidays with my sister a few weeks proir leaving us with no plans. She after messages me saying the hot chococate snd other coffees she brought and told my oldest were for her, were for my sister. I feel my mother was out of line and disrespectful but she sees nothing wrong with her actions I did all the wrong.

I ended up having quite a fun intellectual conversation with one of the girls and ended up asking her out for coffee. You know, it's a low cost outing, no worries if it doesn't work out - yaknow?

Date day: at the start, I wasn't really invested in this coffee date, but once we found out that we had quite close mutual friends and she started showing a genuine sort of appreciation/interest in classical music (I play the cello and this was probably the first ever girl who ever cared about what I liked in classical music), I started to open up more and took the date more seriously. We actually found out we went to schools with further friends in our mutual circle and that coffee date led to a drinks date that evening. Since then, I've taken her out for lunch and dinner and I really enjoy her company and talking to her.

Here's the truth. I've never made it this far (probably at like date 10-ish). The furthest I'd ever gone was 5 dates with a ""summer girl"" (girl I met off Hinge in the summer vacation) and that was it. In terms of the interactions I've had, I feel valued and appreciated which is super nice. But, there's another problem: the romantic side. I don't find her the most attractive. I mean she's pretty enough and I enjoy making out with her. She is a 6.5 out of 10 for me compared to the ""summer girl"" who was more like a 8/8.5 out of 10 - both physically and facially. Sexually, I've found it disappointing too compared to past girls I've gone out with - she's not very experienced (which is fine) but she has bedroom habits which I find incredibly annoying and she is reluctant in reciprocating and learning how to please me back (I do most of the work in our sexual interactions).

Collectively, the romantic and sexual side have been letting me down. Everywhere else, apart from her looks (I'm more of a face > body person) and sexual side, everything's been great. Like she's more of a person I'd want as a wife but not as a college girlfriend? Basically, I'm saying she's really great in every way apart from her looks and sex. I do feel horrible posting this but from reading past reddit posts, it does seem that these are important aspects when committing towards a relationship. I feel like I'm quite deep in now but we're both still in a grey area.

It's the winter vacation now. We've never had the ""what are we"" talk (though I think nowadays many people at least at our age don't talk about it); our Hinge is both active (I saw chat notifications from other guys when we were on dates and now, 've seen that she's moved her location to her hometown area); she's quite secretive and reserved about certain guys I know she had flings with and etc. We're texting a bit here and there but I really don't know. I feel like when we go back for next semester, I either make the move to continue or cut it loose.

I do love me some tea so I‚Äôve been trying to replace it with purchasing tea and will try out loose leaf soon, but I don‚Äôt know how to really push myself to completely give up caffeinated coffee.

Caffeinated tea is fine for me as it doesn‚Äôt contain much, but coffee is the main thing I‚Äôm trying to cut out.

I‚Äôve been reading the caffeine blues and get inspired but it ultimately leads me to quitting for a few days and then drinking double the amount because I missed it.

She is very attractive and we met for coffee. We get along well, she says I make her ""safe"" and listened to and we emotionally and mentally connect. We decide that due to age differences, we can't really commit to anything more than friends.

The next time she comes to my place and we are talking on the couch, lots of touching (she is VERY touchy as its her ""primary love language"") and we started cuddling. We end up hooking up. We both realized we didn't really want to....afterwards.

Honestly, I felt seduced.... and the escalation (her touchy touchy, putting her foot on my body, and accidently brushing me down there, and heavy petting in my crotch area) was due to me being weak in the moment. She said she thought that I had made a decision to commit to a relationship and was disappointed when she realized, afterwards, I did not.

To be honest, she did stop and talk when things escalated, and I told her we can discuss it afterwards. And we continued.

We hung out again. This time I came to her place. We spoke for hours. and we spoke about deep things again, emotional and psychological stuff. No sex happened. and we kept a ""safe"" distance on the couch. Though we were very close.

This time she was wearing a green loose gown. I could see her bra...easily. And honestly, that bra might have been the only thing she was wearing underneath the grown. The grown had long slits on the sides of either leg. So, on the couch, she was very comfortable and she would sit cross legged facing me, and stretch her legs out and cross her legs, revealing much of her thighs..... She was touchy but just to pet my hand or hold my hand.

We are going to continue our friendship. Lol, no sex. She made a long speech stating this.

I‚Äôm 33, 6‚Äô0‚Äù, and living in Maine, where the trees outnumber people. Fun fact: Maine has the deepest lake in New England, Sebago Lake, which plunges down to 316 feet. It‚Äôs the kind of place where hidden gems are just waiting to be discovered, much like me.

Now, onto me:
Personality: Imagine a mix of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a slightly Gothic twist. That‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm the guy who enjoys the irony in horror movies and laughs at life‚Äôs absurdities. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not all doom and gloom; I just appreciate life from a different angle. If you‚Äôre into sarcasm and don‚Äôt take life too seriously, we‚Äôll get along just fine.

Hobbies: If you like comedy and horror flicks, we‚Äôll have plenty to binge-watch together. I‚Äôm also a gamer with a PS5, currently surviving Call of Duty. Not a gamer? No big deal, I‚Äôm open to trying new things and sharing different interests. I think it‚Äôs exciting when two people can introduce each other to new experiences.

Bonus points if you enjoy laid-back mornings. I‚Äôm all about lazy Sundays, relaxing, and making memories over shared experiences.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
Connection: I‚Äôm drawn to women who speak their mind and aren‚Äôt afraid to get real. Whether we‚Äôre vibing over shared interests or learning from our differences, I‚Äôm here for it. If you‚Äôve got a sharp wit and a playful side, I‚Äôll be hooked.

Consistency: I want someone who‚Äôs invested in making our connection strong every single day, no ghosting, no playing games. Consistent effort and genuine affection are non-negotiable for me. If you‚Äôre the type who stays engaged and interested, we‚Äôll have something real and lasting.

Energy: I believe that making an effort is sexy. Let‚Äôs start with a voice or video chat. It‚Äôs more personal and fun than just texting. Plus, if we‚Äôre willing to step out of our comfort zones, who knows what kind of adventures we could end up on together?

Open-Mindedness: I‚Äôm open to long-distance relationships and even the idea of living in another state or country someday, as long as we can visit each other and build our connection. I‚Äôm not looking for a mirror image of myself. In fact, I think it‚Äôs way more fun if we‚Äôre a bit different. It keeps things interesting, and it means we‚Äôll never run out of things to talk about or do together.

Let‚Äôs be real, physical attraction matters. I believe in being upfront and getting that out of the way early. Let‚Äôs exchange pictures as soon as possible so we can both know if we feel that spark. It‚Äôs important to me to build something genuine, and that starts with knowing there‚Äôs mutual attraction.

I also love cuddling, watching movies, and being affectionate. I want a partner who‚Äôs not afraid to express themselves emotionally and intimately. Deep conversations, daily texting, and phone calls are my kind of connection. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who loves to share their feelings and stay close, we‚Äôll be a great match.

The Essentials:
I‚Äôve got a job and my life together, and I‚Äôm hoping you do too. A solid work ethic is a major turn-on for me. I‚Äôve done the long-distance thing before, so if you‚Äôre from another state or even another country, no worries, we can make it work if the chemistry is there.

I‚Äôm looking for someone to join me in discovering the best hidden spots in town, whether it‚Äôs a new coffee shop, a haunted house, or the perfect hiking trail. Let‚Äôs make some memories together.

So, what do you say? Want to see if we‚Äôre a match, or are you going to make me work harder to prove I‚Äôm worth it? Maybe we‚Äôll get lost in the woods of Maine or somewhere equally unexpected, together.",1,1735163575.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

In July 1976, Terri Lynn Ray was fifteen years old. The redheaded girl was described as a free spirit who would pin inspirational notes on her bedroom wall. One of these messages, which read, ""The best things in life aren't free, but the best thing in life is freedom,"" is now etched into Terri's headstone where she is buried in her hometown of Redding, CA.

On Wednesday, July 7, 1976, Terri Lynn Ray returned home after swimming at Clear Creek in Redding with other neighborhood youths. She changed into her blue jeans and football jersey, with a bathing suit underneath, at \~5:30pm. Shortly beforehand she had talked with a friend of hers, Willie Bailey, and they had agreed to meet up at the swimming hole at 8:30pm. According to Terri's mother, Laverne, ""\[Terri\] didn't seem upset at all. She was kidding us about eating a burrito for dinner. There was nothing to me out of the ordinary."" She had told her mother that she was going to meet a friend at the swimming hole, and she was told by her mother to be home by midnight. This was the last time Laverne saw of Terri, as Laverne went out at about 6:45pm; she returned home about five hours later.

Willie Bailey told police that he decided not to go to the swimming hole that night, and that the last time he saw Terri was at the intersection of Canyon Rd and Highway 99 when they parted ways after agreeing to meet up again later. Willie's story, that he went to baseball practice and a party rather than swimming, was confirmed by alibi witnesses.

At about 7:30pm, Terri was last seen by neighborhood friends walking her dog, a shepherd mix named Charlie, away from her home at 1942 Canyon Rd toward Clear Creek. A woman familiar with the area reported driving past the creek at 7:50pm, and established that at the time ""the water was placid and there was no one in sight."" One of Terri's friends, a girl named Carla Benner, reported seeing Terri at the swimming hole at about 8pm talking with a dark-haired, balding man in his 40s. Carla said that she didn't speak with Terri at that time. Another witness, a male, went to the swimming hole at \~9:30pm looking for friends, and also reported that the water was placid and no one was present at the time.

At about 8:10pm five individuals reportedly saw Terri sitting in a medium-sized yellow car -- possibly an El Camino model pickup -- in the parking lot of the Mini Mart, 7200 North Highway 99, with two males and possibly another female, ""on the night before her body was discovered in Clear Creek."" According to one clipping, this was the ""last known sighting"" of Terri before she was killed. However, the witnesses vary in their descriptions and ""don't even agree on the model of auto. Some aren't sure if it was Terri in the car or someone who looked like her.""

When Terri's mother, Laverne, returned to her home at about 11:40pm on July 7, she noticed that Terri's dog Charlie was out of the house. Charlie appeared wet on the legs and bottom of the belly, perhaps from a swim. Also when she returned home, Laverne found a note from Terri inside, stating that some family friends had called at 7:15pm about dinner the following night. According to Laverne, ""There was something wrong with that note. It wasn't signed and Terri always signed a message. She always put 'Love ya, Terri,' or 'see you by 12,' or something."" The message was verified as accurate, ""but it wasn't finished and I had the feeling that someone else had been in the house,"" according to Laverne. A glass of orange juice had been left in an odd place on a bar, and a hand towel in the front bathroom ""was hung in a way that no one in our house hangs a towel.""

Two people, a young boy and girl, reported having visited the creek on a stroll between 11:30 and 11:45pm that night. They left and went home after hearing splashes in the water ""like someone throwing rocks."" According to a detective, ""The splashes could have been something as innocent as fish jumping.""

Terri lived with her mother Laverne, her brother Mike (10yo), and stepfather Gary McGuire. While sources conflict a bit, Terri also seems to have lived with her step-sister Lori (16yo); she also seems to have had a half-sister, Nancy Berry, who lived in San Francisco at the time. Terri's biological father had died in a traffic accident in 1972. When Terri didn't come home by midnight, her family -- Laverne, Mike, Gary, and Lori -- immediately began a search for her. One of the areas they searched was the swimming hole.

On Thursday, July 8, at 1am, two waitresses at a Denny's Restaurant at 735 Market St said they were nearly certain they saw Terri having coffee with an older man, about 40yo. One of the women said she didn't recall any apparent tension between the man and the girl. She also said that she thought it was strange that a young girl was sitting so close to an older man. However, detectives state that these sightings, ""don't tie in with anything else in the case""; same goes for Carla Benner's sighting of Terri talking to an older, balding man at the creek.

At 3am on July 8, Laverne called the Shasta County sheriff's office and reported Terri missing. Laverne said that Terri was always on time, and if she was even a few minutes late that she'd call home. Sheriff's deputies reportedly searched the area around the swimming hole (though when they did this is unclear), but found nothing.

At about noon on July 8, two youths -- Mitch Barsky (19yo) & Linda Canfield (29yo) -- were swimming near the Clear Creek Bridge when they found Terri's body floating in Clear Creek near where it flows under State Route 273 and/or near what was then Highway 99 South. Police promptly responded to the scene.

Terri was originally thought to have been stabbed five or six times, though an autopsy determined that she had been stabbed approximately fifteen (15) times with a knife blade that was about 0.75in wide, though many of the wounds were superficial, and some of them on her hands and arms may have been defensive wounds. She did not have any tissue under her fingernails, indicating that she was unable to scratch her assailant. She also had wounds on her neck, chest, and lower abdomen. Only four of the fifteen total stab wounds were mortal, one being in the neck and the other three in the chest. COD was determined to be deep stab wounds to the chest that punctured both lungs. According to one clipping, ""the differing angles of the wounds lead to 'nothing conclusive.'""

The coroner said that Terri could have been dead 16-18hrs before her body was found, though he emphasized that the estimate was difficult to make because she was in the water so long. A single spot of blood on a rock was found at the scene, though there wasn't enough blood to determine if it was hers. It is uncertain if she was killed at the site, though a couple reports note that there were no signs that she died elsewhere and was moved/dragged to the creek. An autopsy found no signs of sexual assault.

In late September 1976, an 18yo girl named Tina Lynn Crume made statements incriminating herself regarding Terri's murder while under hypnosis. However, investigators found four witnesses who put Crume elsewhere from the murder scene. After several weeks in jail, Crume was released, and murder charges were dropped on/by October 5 1976. The case quickly grew cold from there.

Terri's case was reopened in 2013 when, during their yearly review of the case, investigators realized that some evidence in police custody could now be analyzed using new DNA technology. This evidence was sent for DNA testing; as of December 2024, I have not found anything about the results of this testing. Terri is still listed among the city of Redding's victims of unsolved homicides. A $5,000 reward is available in her case.

What do you think happened to Terri? Who could have killed her and why?

I‚Äôm 33, 6‚Äô0‚Äù, and living in Maine, where the trees outnumber people. Fun fact: Maine has the deepest lake in New England, Sebago Lake, which plunges down to 316 feet. It‚Äôs the kind of place where hidden gems are just waiting to be discovered, much like me.

Now, onto me:
Personality: Imagine a mix of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a slightly Gothic twist. That‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm the guy who enjoys the irony in horror movies and laughs at life‚Äôs absurdities. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not all doom and gloom; I just appreciate life from a different angle. If you‚Äôre into sarcasm and don‚Äôt take life too seriously, we‚Äôll get along just fine.

Hobbies: If you like comedy and horror flicks, we‚Äôll have plenty to binge-watch together. I‚Äôm also a gamer with a PS5, currently surviving Call of Duty. Not a gamer? No big deal, I‚Äôm open to trying new things and sharing different interests. I think it‚Äôs exciting when two people can introduce each other to new experiences.

Bonus points if you enjoy laid-back mornings. I‚Äôm all about lazy Sundays, relaxing, and making memories over shared experiences.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
Connection: I‚Äôm drawn to women who speak their mind and aren‚Äôt afraid to get real. Whether we‚Äôre vibing over shared interests or learning from our differences, I‚Äôm here for it. If you‚Äôve got a sharp wit and a playful side, I‚Äôll be hooked.

Consistency: I want someone who‚Äôs invested in making our connection strong every single day, no ghosting, no playing games. Consistent effort and genuine affection are non-negotiable for me. If you‚Äôre the type who stays engaged and interested, we‚Äôll have something real and lasting.

Energy: I believe that making an effort is sexy. Let‚Äôs start with a voice or video chat. It‚Äôs more personal and fun than just texting. Plus, if we‚Äôre willing to step out of our comfort zones, who knows what kind of adventures we could end up on together?

Open-Mindedness: I‚Äôm open to long-distance relationships and even the idea of living in another state or country someday, as long as we can visit each other and build our connection. I‚Äôm not looking for a mirror image of myself. In fact, I think it‚Äôs way more fun if we‚Äôre a bit different. It keeps things interesting, and it means we‚Äôll never run out of things to talk about or do together.

Let‚Äôs be real, physical attraction matters. I believe in being upfront and getting that out of the way early. Let‚Äôs exchange pictures as soon as possible so we can both know if we feel that spark. It‚Äôs important to me to build something genuine, and that starts with knowing there‚Äôs mutual attraction.

I also love cuddling, watching movies, and being affectionate. I want a partner who‚Äôs not afraid to express themselves emotionally and intimately. Deep conversations, daily texting, and phone calls are my kind of connection. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who loves to share their feelings and stay close, we‚Äôll be a great match.

The Essentials:
I‚Äôve got a job and my life together, and I‚Äôm hoping you do too. A solid work ethic is a major turn-on for me. I‚Äôve done the long-distance thing before, so if you‚Äôre from another state or even another country, no worries, we can make it work if the chemistry is there.

I‚Äôm looking for someone to join me in discovering the best hidden spots in town, whether it‚Äôs a new coffee shop, a haunted house, or the perfect hiking trail. Let‚Äôs make some memories together.

So, what do you say? Want to see if we‚Äôre a match, or are you going to make me work harder to prove I‚Äôm worth it? Maybe we‚Äôll get lost in the woods of Maine or somewhere equally unexpected, together.",1,1735163493.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

This is going to be a pretty long text so bare with me if my story telling isn't continious, English isn't my first language :)

My father (50) cheated on my mom (50) after 30 years of marriage with his 38 year old barber, who has two children. He's been in my life for 20 years. Now, our family has broken apart and my mom and 16 year old sister are moving out in the upcoming weekend.

My dad has always been a VERY religious man. We attended a lot of ""church meetings"" for as long as I can remember. He has (could now say ""had"") always had good morals and he's raised me to be a good man, at least in my opinion. A month ago, he left the religious congregation. He says he left, because he doesn't agree with how things are handled there and how other people teach and understand the Bible wrongly. This made sense for me until I was told by my mom that he's been seing this woman since summer and summer was the time he started talking about leaving almost every day. He won't admit it, but I believe he's deceived us all into believing that he left because of the reasons I mentioned above.

He grew up in a very toxic household. His father was a drunk who beat his mom and cheated on her on a daily basis. He despises his father to the maximum extent, but does the same thing (except for drinking and beating her) AFTER 30 YEARS OF MARRIAGE. My mom has given EVERYTHING to him: her money, love, time, health and that's how this greatous religious man repays her.

 Funny thing is, he doesn't even seem to understand what he's doing. It's like he's a suddenly a completely different person. That is not my dad, at least not the dad I've lived my whole life with. He acts if everything's normal. He first told about his affair to his mom and sister. He even asked his sister if it was fine if he came to have coffee sometimes with this new ""girlfriend"". My grandmom and aunt disowned him and he had no one left except for me, my girlfriend, my mom, my sister and a few friends. Now, he doesn't even have that. I can't believe it, what is he thinking? Why is he doing that? What made the man I knew become an exact opposite of his beliefs in a matter of 6 months? Why? Just, why?

My mom and dad had many talks about this over the past week and all my dad could say was: ""I can't do anything about it, it's how I feel. I can't fight my feelings. Would you like a man who's physically there, but mentally not?"". It's just f-in insane. He ""won't sell the house"" and asked my mom to leave today. He doesn't work 6 months of the year, these 6 months, they live off my mom's paychecks. How will he be able to afford food, animal food, electricity, bills, loans and all the chores around the house ALONE? I just can't come to understand what the f is he thinking? I am certain that gold digger of a woman will leave him in some time and he will be alone. He will have nothing but memories of a seemingly happy family. I don't know if anyone would ever forgive him but he will be completely alone if that woman leaves him. I think he's setting up his life for an ultimate failure and I'm scared of what the future holds for him, because he can't see past this.

He hasn't talked to me since I got told about this fiasco. It's fine though, I live on my own and it doesn't affect me as much. But, he hasn't talked to my sister either who lives with them. Not a single word, my sister's birthday was ruined because of his actions. He didn't even properly wish happy birthday to her, it was a cold and dead ""Happy birthday"". From what I've heard from my mom, he doesn't believe he has to tell us about this situation, but that WE have to go to him to talk about it. WHAT? How big of a coward can you be? I think there's something seriously wrong with him, like a health issue that affects his brain maybe? Because this is just unreal and a shock to all of us.

I still love and painfully miss my ""old dad"" but this, whatever he has become now, is dead to me. It hurts me so, so much. I feel betrayed and lost. How will I come to terms with my father never being in my life again after 20 years?

Looking for some advice or insights on something that‚Äôs been happening to me recently. Long story short, there‚Äôs this very handsome guy who works in a different department, but we cross paths occasionally. I could tell he was trying to get my attention, and that‚Äôs exactly why I avoided giving him any, I didn‚Äôt want to feed his ego. For over a year, he kept trying: asking me out for coffee, giving compliments, and being sweet and persistent. He eventually got my number and name from one of my colleagues, and NGL i was impressed but still wasn‚Äôt interested. 
He‚Äôd always compliment me, saying how beautiful I was, how reserved and intimidating I seemed, but that he liked it. One time, in front of all my colleagues, he hugged me so tightly, like he hadn‚Äôt seen me in years which caught me off guard.

Recently, I decided to give him a chance. I was coming out of a tough situation after being led on by someone I really liked, and his attention felt refreshing. I started talking to him more and realized how much I enjoyed our chemistry. He was so flirty and charming, and I started craving that connection. Slowly, I began seeing him differently not just as someone who liked to chase girls, but as this incredibly handsome, buff, confident guy. The more we talked, the more I found myself drawn to him.

He eventually asked me out. At first, I hesitated because I didn‚Äôt want things to go too far, but I told myself I needed to give it a chance. When we met, I couldn‚Äôt stop noticing his eyes, lips, and hands.. it was impossible to ignore the tension. We kept meeting up, and eventually, the sexual chemistry took over. We hooked up, and it was amazing. I can‚Äôt lie i thought why did i wait for this long to let this happen. the kiss, the tension, the connection everything felt mind blowing. It was something of an experience

But now, things feel different. I‚Äôve noticed a shift in his energy. I met him for only few times outside work. But he isn‚Äôt as playful or flirty as before, and our conversations have become more about just meeting up and sex which i don‚Äôt hate but i don‚Äôt like it either.  Although I still see him at work and he looks at me the same way, the dynamic is off. For e.g he would message me ‚Äò hey‚Äô and if i reply saying ‚Äò hey‚Äô after 5 hours he replies like nothing as before he was always on time. 

Is it just me, or do some guys lose interest once the chase is over? I‚Äôve started pulling back now as i don‚Äôt want to keep meeting him because i am a relationship type of person and i am looking for someone serious so i don‚Äôt want to waste my time hooking up when there‚Äôs no future. 

Anyways sorry about my rant.. i don‚Äôt feel sad or anything because i know the outcome but i Would love to hear your thoughts!",1,1735162769.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

Hello,

Just started playing a few days ago and I'm having a blast. I've achieved automation of coffee and I'm trying to get my coffee turnover time down. I've found that my slowest step is when people sit in front of where the teleporters are, since they sometimes grab the coffee before it gets grabbed, but sometimes they don't, Is there a way to make it so they always grab it, or have the coffee cycle around in a ring without re-teleporting? Also is there a way to fit in more coffee machine automation in if I wanted to add more teleporters?

Also unrelated to the coffee but any tips for how to get farther with other recipes while playing solo, I find that with cleaning plates especially, I can't quite keep up and survive before I can implement grabbers and stuff to help me out.

Thanks!",1,1735162563.0,PlateUp,0,1.0,False

Premi√®re publication sur Reddit pour moi, et je n'ai bu du caf√© que deux fois dans ma vie. Donc, par avance, merci pour votre indulgence et vos explications si je m'y prends mal.

Chez mes parents pour No√´l, j'apprends qu'ils cherchent d√©sesp√©r√©ment √† acheter leur caf√© pr√©f√©r√© depuis des mois, mais qu'ils n'en trouvent nulle part. Mon p√®re a essay√© de passer commande en ligne, sans jamais recevoir sa commande ni r√©cup√©rer son argent.  
Je vous joins quelques photos. Je n'ai pas plus d'informations, si ce n'est qu'ils l'achetaient chez Leclerc et qu'il a disparu du jour au lendemain.

1hm9fle,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1hm9fle/royalton_saint_lucia_beware_save_your_money/,Royalton Saint Lucia: Beware / Save Your Money,"Recently spent 7 days there ‚Ä¶ before getting into the ‚Äúbeware‚Äù part a few positives:

1) the location is very pretty, albeit two hours from the airport

2) food and food service is generally pretty good for an all inclusive, except at the buffet where I‚Äôm still waiting for my coffee to show up.

Aside from that, this place is a mismanaged mess that also tries to take customers for a ride.  Most notably:

1) beware the wrist band scam.  At check in they gave us both a room key and offered us a ‚ÄúMarriott elite‚Äù plastic bracelet (like you get at a bar) with unclear benefits.  Thinking it might entitle us to some special perks, we took it.  After a few days of wearing it where that was clearly not the case, we took them off and threw them away.  Upon checkout, the front desk demanded $600 for the DISPOSABLE plastic bracelets.  Now I can understand why they might do that with the keys (which is what they explained at checkin) to prevent you from having extra guests on your all inclusive fare, but for an optional plastic bracelet that they literally cut off and throw in the garbage?  To enforce this scam, they won‚Äôt let you leave the hotel ‚Äî literally ‚Äî as the cab drivers won‚Äôt go until they get the ok.  I asked to see the paperwork they claimed said I agreed to this penalty, and they refused.  After arguing for 20 minutes and going through several layers of management they called someone at ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù and they finally let us go (presumably after checking our bonvoy status).  While we were waiting at least two other customers found themselves in the same predicament.  What a horrible last impression to leave on customers.

2) they take no accountability for your transport to/from the resort.  They route you to a company called Nexus Tours.  I triple confirmed with Nexus that they‚Äôd have car seats for our young kids upon arrival, and lo and behold, they did not, for the two hour treacherous drive to the hotel.  Tried calling the hotel to help (find an alternative maybe?) but they said they don‚Äôt deal with transport.  Want help getting a refund from Nexus?  Hotel won‚Äôt help you there either.  Ultimately it took my wife begging and pleading with other drivers until she found one.  Also still waiting on my refund.

3) terrible maintenance ‚Äî elevators and escalators not working most of the trip, no running water in our room at times, most of the public bathrooms have broken door handles / don‚Äôt lock, kids pool out of order, hot tub out of order, etc etc.  You expect much better at this price point.

4) they had an event called ‚Äúfamily friendly foam party‚Äù that was anything but.  Exploitive laden music, women in thongs on stage ‚Ä¶ basically college spring break with our toddlers there.

I feel bad for the staff because most of them are trying to be helpful but at best management is absent ‚Äî at worst they are actively trying to ripoff customers.",7,1735162062.0,marriott,3,0.89,False

I love him so much. he's able to make me feel the same Christmas magic and happiness that I felt as a kid, if not even more.

I loved waking up with him in the morning, getting up early to open the stockings we got for each other and making coffee (hot chocolate for him, he's the coffee hater in this relationship...) before opening the presents we got each other. the note he wrote for me in the card makes me want to bawl. he told me he hopes that this is just our first Christmas together out of at least 29 more years.

I've been considering updating my grinder, and am finally ready to do so. I've never used flat burrs, but I tend to drink light or medium roasts, so for the past 2 years I've wondered if my grinder was the best choice for me (it was a starter grinder i was gifted, so it served its purpose well getting me into the hobby). 

I never drink milk drinks or other types of brews, just shots of espresso, always black. I always single dose, and even bought the Sette single dose hopper. I make 2 shots every morning. I typically use a different bag of beans every time my current bag runs out. 

What's important to me:
Flat burrs - preferably upgradeable
Good build quality - will last, and is from a reputable company known for quality
Good workflow
Not a pain to clean
Drastically quieter than my Sette
Makes great coffee 

I was originally looking at some type of Eureka. First considered a Specialita but then was considering a Libra for the added convenience of built in scale. Based on my research (reddit threads and YouTube videos) I was starting to feel this maybe isn't a big upgrade and won't be enough bang for my buck. I was looking at some of the DF options but I'm not sure those are for me based on all the alignment problems I've seen, and generally me wanting to buy from a company with a reputation for consistent quality and customer service. 

Somehow, I've now landed on the P64 as a potential grinder for me. This is 2x the original budget I had for myself but I'm thinking this is ""endgame"" or at least would pair nicely with whatever machine I buy in the foreseeable future. I will probably buy an espresso machine for around 2000$ in spring, but I do dream of having a Decent or something very high end one day, and don't want to purchase a new grinder if/when that upgrade happens. 

Now all of this being said, I haven't actually tried flat burrs. I suspect I will like them just based on my coffee preferences - light or medium, never dark. So that feels a little silly for such a big purchase. But given that I will go on trips and end up coming home with bags of 4 different roasters Ethiopian light roasts, it feels like flat burrs should be my preference. 

What do we think? Is there a better option than any I've looked at? Is the P64 the one for me?

","Hi folks. I‚Äôve been scouring the posts on here and I have noticed a tension where some folks suggest lower end (¬£200-400) machines can‚Äôt make tasty longer black specialty coffee drinks, but others seem to suggest the opposite. 

I‚Äôm needing to fully automate as have two young kids and no time for filter brewing. Bean to cup should be ideal‚Ä¶ except I‚Äôm used to delicious filter brews with high levels of flavour and complexity. If it had a grinder, I‚Äôd have gone for the Fellow Aiden no question. (Grinding is often one step too many sadly, yep really.)

I do enjoy specialty espresso once in a while but often find Americanos or long blacks a bit bland, and generally haven‚Äôt had any great experiences with bean to cup machines. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the machines or the quality and type of beans & water. I‚Äôm happy to switch to a morning lungo or double espresso when the kids are around, but ideally it would be longer black coffee drinks I‚Äôd have. (I even saw someone recommend not using the long drinks settings on these machines but instead diluting espresso by boiling the kettle, which, if necessary seems to defeat the purpose of the B2C).

With my Third Wave Water treated water, and good specialty coffee beans, can I get even close to the nuances I‚Äôm used to (bright acidity, complexity etc)? Some reviews on here boast about great results with dark super roasty coffee, which is fine if that‚Äôs your thing, but it ain‚Äôt mine. I haven‚Äôt seen many endorsements of using the lower end machines with higher end beans.

Lymph node issues timeline:

a. 15th Feb 2024: Lymph node swelling in left armpit. Grew to about 2.5 cm in diameter and turned visibly red. Antibiotics didn't have an effect by the time they were started and it was drained on the surgeon's recommendation. Complete healing took 2-3 months.

b. 19th June 2024: Lymph node swelling in left armpit. Small swelling about 0.5 cm. Antibiotics helped, and it healed.

c. 27th Nov 2024: Lymph node swelling under jaw. Antibiotics shrank it, and it became painless after 20 days.
Doctor ran tests this time which came as below:
i. Vitamin D: Critically low at 8 ng/mL (normal: 20-30 ng/mL).
ii. SGPT: Elevated at 88 u/L (normal: 13-69 u/L).
Took 3 vitamin D tablets till now, once every week.

d. 14th Dec 2024: Lymph node swelling in left armpit. Taking antibiotics course still.

My daily Routine:

I wake up at 10 am and work from home, spending most of my day sitting at a desk. I usually take a bath around 6 pm, have dinner at 9 pm, and go for a short walk until 10 pm. Afterward, I use my phone until around 2 am before going to bed.
My lifestyle has been predominantly sedentary since 2020. I rarely engage in physical activity and spend the majority of my time indoors, with little to no exposure to sunlight for weeks at a time.

-----
Background Health Issues:

2020: Diagnosed with duodenal ulcers after a delayed diagnosis. Occasional stomach pain even after treatment led to a diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder. Currently managing symptoms.

2022: Diagnosed with heart palpitations. Increased heart rate in ECG. Other heart-related tests came back normal. The doctor said not to worry as no concerns were found and the issue would get better with time. I stopped drinking tea, coffee, and cold drinks because I noticed a pattern when consuming them. The palpitations have since reduced.

My doctor thinks a vitamin deficiency is behind the lymph node issues. But after I did some googling, I‚Äôm worried it could be something more serious.

I don't get this love/hate thing with fictional characters but i can say that i like griffith more than guts 

First of all griffith is a well written character unlike guts who is filled with flaws and thats what makes him good, on the other hand griffith is nearly perfect a mastermind yet can be driven by his emotions sometimes. 

Let's discuss the reasons why y'all hate him
Betrayed his band: well if you think about it you'll find that every king has his soldiers die for him, his kingdom, or his selfish dream, you don't hate them all, why because they never declared it. 
And even so you don't hate Erwin Smith from AOT when he said that all this soldiers died for him and he's selfish dream of knowing the truth and what's beyond the walls. 

That is the major act why you hate him but there's  more important reasons we'll discuss them later. 

I previously said that guts is filled with flaws (griffith also) but i don't blame griffith when he said to princess Charlotte and i quote {In my mind a true friend never relies on another's dream, the man who would be my freind must have his own reason for living, beyond me and he should put his heart and soul in protecting his dream, he should never hesetate to defend it even egainst me, for me to call a man my freind he must be equal to me in all respects} and im 100% with griffith on this one too
You can see the shock in guts eyes when he said that and honestly he deserves it, he just killed an innocent kid and for what for a guy that he's not even considering him as a freind rather a soldier who sacrificed himself for his selfish dream 

Guts doesn't have a goal in life, following someone else's dream, still following them after getting betrayed, living a nightmare every day, can't sleep at night, appearing as the bad man, on the other hand griffith living his life, surrounded by strong people, not living a single struggle and appearing as the good figure
It's like the old dudes in my local coffee shop complaing about the government, oh this country sucks, the government is stealing our money, they're taxing the whole salary. Bro get a job, you're unemployed, and the government is in fact stealing our money and living the best life

And you guys are so full of shit why you didn't feel bad for the ones thad actually died in the eclipse you felt bad for the wrong person, i mean casca y'all right on this one but guts NO. 

Back to the other reasons why you hate griffith, raping casca, sleeping with the prinsess, and then blaming guts, it's all mistakes that he made along the way and that's what balances the character. 
I mean raping casca and causing a terrible shock is a pretty big deal im with you on that one, the princess liked it (it's not rape) 

In the end, every king must climb a mountain of sacrifices to reach his dream

I know it's pretty long, but i hope you enjoyed it

She is very attractive and we met for coffee. We get  along well, she says I make her ""safe"" and listened to and we emotionally and mentally connect.  We decide that due to age differences, we can't really commit to anything more than friends.

The next time she comes to my place and we are talking on the couch, lots of touching  (she is VERY touchy as its her ""primary love language"") and we started cuddling. We end up hooking up. We both realized we didn't really want to....afterwards.

Honestly, I felt seduced.... and the escalation (her touchy touchy, putting her foot on my body, and accidently brushing me down there, and heavy petting in my crotch area) was due to me being weak in the moment. She said she thought that I had made a decision to commit to a relationship and was disappointed when she realized, afterwards, I did not.

To be honest, she did stop and talk when things escalated, and I told her we can discuss it afterwards. And we continued.

We hung out again. This time I came to her place. We spoke for hours. and we spoke about deep things again, emotional and psychological stuff. No sex happened. and we kept a ""safe"" distance on the couch. Though we were very close.

This time she was wearing a green loose gown. I could see her bra...easily. And honestly, that bra might have been the only thing she was wearing underneath the grown. The grown had long slits on the sides of either leg. So, on the couch, she was very comfortable and she would sit cross legged facing me, and stretch her legs out and cross her legs, revealing much of her thighs..... She was touchy but just to pet my hand or hold my hand.

We are going to continue our friendship. Lol, no sex.  She made a long speech stating this.

'justice',"These are a compilation of my notes from an argument/debate I was having with someone over 'cancel culture':

>**Being aware when people are engaging in mob mentality against someone can clue us in to the fact that people are being reactionary and potentially engaging in groupthink that is problematic.**

>'Cancel culture' can be seen as a mob response to someone who is perceived to have violated moral standards, and there is therefore a desire for collective/group retribution for the purposes of punishment.  

>**People determine whether someone is 'cancelled' versus 'receives consequences' based on the moral standard being applied and whether they agree with it.**

>There is no benefit of the doubt, no curiosity why a person acted or responded the way they did, nothing but immediate opinions and vitriol based on an assumed understanding of reality.

>**Negative group social repercussion is cancellation or not based on whether you agree with it: if you do, it isn't 'cancellation', it's justice.**

>The point of a mob is collective retribution and 'justice', and whether one considers it 'cancellation' or not depends on whether you agree with the mob.

Usually when I am having this discussion, people misinterpret my stance because they want to argue with me about whether or not the 'cancellation' or 'consequences' is morally justified when I, personally, am extremely nervous about the *mob itself*.

I lived in Miami during the Eli√°n Gonz√°lez situation in 1999, then experienced the furor around the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and in both cases you couldn't even speak out for the other perspective or question anything.  People who might otherwise think well of you, would essentially think you were 'evil' if you didn't agree with them on these issues and shouted anyone down who thought otherwise.

I've been suspicious of 'the mob' ever since.  It is *unbelievable* to me how a majority will coalesce around an opinion - especially on a topic that needs serious consideration from multiple informed perspectives - and *wild* that no one ever seems to realize that they are the mob or that they are rampantly uninformed about an issue.  Try speaking in defense of the 'McDonald's hot coffee' plaintiff back in 1992, and suddenly people (with no background in the legal field, no understanding of the facts of the case, nor waiting for the discovery process to unfold) were violently anti-tort and viciously against 79-year-old Stella Liebeck.

It's like a philosophical 'swarming' behavior, and what's particularly troubling is how the mob mentality seems to compress complex situations into simple moral binaries and creates intense pressure for conformity of thought and expression.  What makes this pattern truly dangerous is how quickly dissent gets reframed as malice.

The final, crushing logic of the mob: that to question its judgment is itself proof of evil.",5,1735159710.0,AbuseInterrupted,0,1.0,False
1hm8ovd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hm8ovd/this_is_whats_important_i_believe/,"This is what's important, I believe","Hey guys,

It's still Christmas time, and I have a story for you all that I've lived with my own eyes. Perhaps, it might help someone to see what's really important in one's life.

Lately, I‚Äôve been reflecting on my past relationships‚Äîboth friendships and romantic ones. I have never had fleeting connections; they always last long enough for me to learn something real about the other person. I‚Äôve been trying to remember what each of them felt like.

I‚Äôve always viewed my life as a kind of adventure, forging ahead and learning new things on my own terms. That didn‚Äôt leave much room to stick with people who saw life differently and didn‚Äôt want to walk hand in hand. And yet, I‚Äôve always craved a sense of belonging‚Äîa place to call home. Two against the world.

When I look back at the relationship that brought me to Romania, I don‚Äôt recall much tender feeling, apart from some wistful nostalgia: we were friends, playing little games, talking about random stuff. I know I pretty much left my whole life behind to come to her, changed my views drastically, adapted to a completely new environment.

But to me, it was still part of my own adventure‚Äîjust a means to an end. When she broke up with me, I was devastated. Not because I loved her deeply (though she was a dear friend), but because the relationship didn‚Äôt end on my terms. By that point, I had already been thinking of leaving. I didn‚Äôt believe she could give me what I truly wanted in life.

I came to realize the same dynamic repeated itself in all my relationships. I never truly loved.

Everything really changed this year, though, when I unexpectedly met someone who turned out to be incredibly important. At first, we couldn‚Äôt stand each other‚Äîshe thought I was arrogant and judgmental, and I found her awkward and narrow-minded.

Not exactly a recipe for success, right?

But somehow, over the following two months, we stayed in touch and managed to smooth out our differences. We grew around each other. We talked through everything, discussing what we disliked about each other and how we could fix it. We‚Äôre both very set in our ways, but we genuinely tried to see things through each other‚Äôs eyes.

We were so different, yet we became closer than anyone‚Äîvery quickly. We traveled a bit, spent amazing nights just cuddling, woke each other up for morning coffee, took ridiculously long walks, played tennis, watched Comedy Central. More importantly, we took care of each other selflessly, never expecting anything in return.

We were genuinely happy to see each other every time; our smiles couldn‚Äôt have been brighter. Suddenly, this country‚Äîand the whole world‚Äîfelt like the best place to be.

And that‚Äôs when I finally understood what love is. It‚Äôs not a spark, not common interests, definitely not physical appearance (though I never believed it was all about that). It‚Äôs the loyalty and willingness to work through differences, keeping the other person‚Äôs happiness firmly in mind.

That feeling is so clear to remember.

Fast-forward to the end of November. We‚Äôd just returned from Italy‚ÄîBologna and Florence. We ate tons of gelato, walked countless steps, and visited ancient buildings. We couldn‚Äôt have been happier.

A few days later, she developed a weird rash all over her body. At first, we didn‚Äôt think much of it, and neither did the doctors we visited in Bucharest. They said it was a simple allergy and that a few pills should clear it up. Naturally, we relaxed.

But soon, the rash came with excruciating muscle pain, bad enough that she could hardly walk. She started running a fever, developed a sore throat, sweated profusely, and lost her appetite.

We ended up at Victor Babe»ô Hospital for infectious diseases. After a week there, she was sent home without a diagnosis‚Äîjust a recommendation to see a rheumatologist. I wanted us to stay, but she was extremely stressed. She‚Äôd gained 12 kg in just six days and wanted a couple of days at home first, despite her suffering.

Little did I know that two days later, I‚Äôd be living the worst nightmare of my life.

That day, she felt a lot worse. I stayed by her side, bought her pills, checked her temperature, helped her drink water, changed blankets, and talked to her. Around 8 p.m., she said she was very tired and going to sleep.

Over the next few hours, she got up a couple of times to use the toilet, chat with me briefly, kiss me, and tell me she felt awful.

Then the nightmare truly began.

Around 11:30 p.m., I realized something was really wrong. She was cold, her body shook periodically, she thrashed in bed, and she wouldn‚Äôt respond to anything but the simplest questions.

Then came the ambulance and the emergency hospital. I kept telling and retelling the doctors everything I could about what had been happening. Being a foreigner didn‚Äôt help; I felt they weren‚Äôt taking me seriously.

She forgot how to speak Romanian and only answered in English. She stared at everything around her with a glazed look in her eyes‚Äîlike she was seeing right through us. She couldn‚Äôt even put on her pants by herself.

I‚Äôd been awake for nearly 48 hours. Her sister, Liliana, urged me to go home for a bit, promising she‚Äôd stay with her. That was my biggest mistake‚Äîbecause it was the last time I saw her conscious.

Liliana later told me that before transferring her to the Fundeni Clinical Institute, one of the paramedics asked if they were sisters. My girlfriend grinned widely and said, ‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôre sisters.‚Äù Moments later, she had what looked like an epileptic seizure and slipped into a deep coma.

I wasn‚Äôt there to see it. Just thinking about missing her last moment breaks my heart into pieces I can‚Äôt put into words. I should have been there to witness it.

That same night, her heart stopped.

They resuscitated her, but what followed was a month of living in the ICU at Fundeni. I remember almost nothing beyond standing by her bed, talking to her, and listening to the relentless beeping of the machines. It‚Äôs all a blur‚Äîexcept for her face. And a bunch of incredibly cruel doctors, refusing any kind of hope. 

Then, on 12/23/2024, at 3 a.m., her little heart stopped again. This time, there was no bringing her back. She passed away for good. In truth, she‚Äôd likely been brain-dead since the moment they loaded her into that ambulance‚Äîright after answering that question about her sister.

That month of praying, consulting countless neurosurgeons, not sleeping or eating, and hoping for a miracle‚Äînone of it mattered. She was already gone.

Her name was Maria Cristina CrƒÉciun.

Tomorrow is her funeral, which I can‚Äôt physically attend. I‚Äôm devastated, to say the least.

She was only 33, with her whole life ahead of her. She‚Äôll never have the house we spent so long imagining. She‚Äôll never have a child. She‚Äôll never travel to another new country or try a new food (she was never big on trying new foods anyway).

There‚Äôs so much left unsaid between us, and I‚Äôd give anything just to talk to her one more time. Honestly, if they‚Äôd told me I could give her my heart or brain to keep her alive, I‚Äôd have done it in a heartbeat. But it‚Äôs meaningless now‚Äîonly pain remains, for now‚Ä¶

Still, this whole experience has opened my eyes to what love truly is. It carved that feeling into my mind, and I doubt I‚Äôll ever forget. Not only do I know now that what I‚Äôve been longing for my entire life is possible, I also know how it feels. I‚Äôll remember it fondly. And I understand what it takes‚Äîand what it gives‚Äîto love.

That, at least, is invaluable.

So, I hope that:

\- You‚Äôve also discovered what love is in your relationship.

\- You won‚Äôt hold back on saying what matters, because you might not get another chance.

Thank you for reading.

I'm so tired of agonising over what happened. I don't even know why I still am, a year later. It's ridiculous. It certainly hurts less now, but it's still a constant and gets worse when I'm bored (like during the holidays). 

I'll always treasure the time we spent together, even if it was turbulent and you ultimately squandered it. You did what you felt you needed to at the time. It hurt me what you told C, saying that we casted you aside like a ""freak"". For my part, I was heartbroken and miserable, trying to give you what you wanted, which was distance, while you were moving on with the girl you were sleeping with. I was angry for sure, but really I just missed you and wanted you back, but knew there was little I could do. I also knew deep down you didn't really give a shit about me by that point, as is probably the case now. I don't remember anyone being particularly mean towards you either, it's not like I told my friends to act a certain way toward you, I just told them about what happened. What I'm trying to say is, you have no right to be pissed off with me and I have every right to despise you, which I think you know once you escape your victim complex for a second.

Because, at least from my point of view, you didn't suffer much after the ""break-up"" (if you can call it that), while I, on the other hand, entered a three month long emotional coma. At one point, I ran a 5k every day for a week until I destroyed my body because it was the only time of day I could clear my mind. I was losing a lot of weight during this time as well and couldn't focus on studying. The question of why you suddenly (or maybe not so suddenly) stopped caring about me was driving me nuts and making me depressed. I'm retrospect, I should have just taken what you had told me at face value, accepted that you were a dick and moved on, but I was too attached and so that process took longer than anticipated. While I was suffering I'm sure you were having a great time with the girl you told me you never liked. Hearing that you were in a relationship with her was probably the nail in the coffin for me, or maybe it was Valentine's Day- when we passed on the street like strangers- that really knocked me down.

Having said this, I'm not writing this as an attack. I'm trying to put into words the frustration I have been feeling about my side of the story not being heard. I'm not sure if I still care about what you think, or what others think, however. I'm just trying to articulate my thoughts and relax my mind a bit.

I miss you, I miss your hands and when you'd speak French and the way you'd make me feel. I miss watching movies with you and exchanging music and the way you'd look at me. I found you to be a very funny and interesting person, to put it simply. I think I viewed our relationship in not even a necessarily always romantic light, but one based on mutual interest and understanding on some level. I don't know. It's been so long that I don't even know what we had and how to miss it properly. It confused me at the time, to be fair. Maybe that's why your betrayal, and I will call it that, hurt me so deeply. 

Above all, I miss what could have been- and maybe thats why I've felt jealousy over your relationship. But at the end of the day I know that those fantasies are results of my own obscured perception of things. But tell me you don't also sometimes think about what could have been? If I had just said yes to getting coffee with you, or not put you down after Halloween, or say no to the Christmas ball. I don't know. I had my reasons for those decisions, however, even if in retrospect I hate myself for them. Halloween did mean a great deal to me, by the way. And the kiss on the street the day after that I can't forget. In fact, if you have ever thought that the whole thing didn't mean that much to me, just know that before we left for the break you had accidentally left your watch in my room. Before I returned it to you I kissed the back of it. That's why I was so upset when you showed me you replaced it when we had come back.

All of this to say- I miss you, but I'm moving on and I desperately want to do so. My boyfriend loves me, and he appreciates me and he doesn't lovebomb and leave for fuck sake. And he is sweet and kind. I'm sure it's the same for you. Maybe we can meet again in a year or two and properly talk it all through and perhaps forgive each other (even if I suspect you've forgotten everything.) But if not, that's ok too. We'll always have the memories, at least I will.
I'll try to forgive you, one day.

Current situation that I am likely overreacting to, but feel somewhat justified given a past behavioral pattern:

My (34F) boyfriend (34M) of the past few (almost three) years (and does not live in the same city as me) has this habit of saying he will want to do/see a tv show/movie with me, only to just go ahead and do it without me. The most recent example: a new biopic for my absolute favorite artist of all time came out this week. I‚Äôm using a throwaway account, but even my Reddit username is an homage to this artist. Boyfriend told me several months ago how excited to see this movie (as was I, it was literally the ONE movie I‚Äôve been looking forward to all year), only to tell me a few days ago that he has plans to see it with his parents (who are visiting him from across the country for the holidays). He‚Äôs claiming they just sprung this on him and he had no say in the matter (he knew for several days beforehand and, in my opinion, his parents are the type who arekind enough to reschedule). His compromise is that he we will watch it again with me, but I‚Äôm being stubborn and told him to forget it and that I‚Äôll go on my own or with my friends.

Why I‚Äôm hurt:

-I‚Äôve expressed this pet peeve so many times in the past. For example, I waited to watch the newest season of a tv show that we both love with him only to find out that he was already several episodes in. His compromise was to watch it with me, which amounted to him putting it on the tv for me while I was at his place and him leaving the room to take a shower and hang out with his brother/roommate. 

-Another example: a few months ago we agreed to watch a movie ‚Äútogether‚Äù from our respective households (again, we live about 1.5-2 hours from each other). We decided on a time to start the movie, so I quickly showered and made a quick dinner to make it on time, only to find out that he started the movie ten minutes ahead of our agreed-upon time without telling me.

There are more examples, but they fall along the same pattern. I know I‚Äôm a grown-ass woman who is capable of watching movies/tv shows on my own, but, on a fundamental level, I‚Äôm seeing this as a total lack of disrespect and selfishness on his part. I‚Äôve told him how much this annoys me in the past and he continues to do what he wants. 


So not related to the movie/tv thing specifically, but other examples which make me worry about this behavioral pattern:

1. A couple years ago I needed an abortion. One that he was just as responsible as me for. He was with friends the weekend I found I was pregnant, so I sat on the news and feeling so anxious and scared because I didn‚Äôt want to ruin his weekend. When that weekend was finally over, I called him and told him what the situation was and my plan to abort (neither of us want kids, ever) and clearly was crying, only for him to make a flippant joke (‚Äúif YOU were to keep it, what would YOU name it?‚Äù). Additionally, he made absolutely zero offer to come over or support me during the appointment. A year or two later I found out (from him) that when one of his female friends found out she was pregnant, he was willing to drop everything to take her to a clinic immediately. Even just a few weeks before our situation, he took a day off work to go snowboarding with his friends on a whim. We have talked about this so many times and his response is that he made a mistake, he‚Äôs sorry, and wants to just move forward. 

2. Boyfriend and I bond over our love of doing outdoorsy things. Being able to do something active and outside on the weekend is mentally and physically fulfilling (for me at least, since I work at a desk all week). There have been so many instances over the past two years where we make a plan to wake up early on a Saturday or Sunday to go hiking/biking/etc only for him to be impossible to wake up before noon the day of because he wants to sleep in (usually as a result of drinking/partying the night before). I know it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect him to want to do outdoorsy things and wake up early every weekend, but it just feels especially hurtful when we make a plan to do something and he just bails to fill his needs. Not to mention, I‚Äôve woken up at 4 am several times to go snowboarding with him (and have made it a point to wake up before him to make coffee for us to make the morning as smooth as possible).

3. Last year we decided to NYE in his city, which entailed of going to a house party his friends were throwing. We typically do NYE in my city because of its walkability to bars and the population of young professionals. I was thrilled to do something different for a change and do genuinely like the people who were throwing the party, but I spent most of the night sitting alone in front of the tv because he was going around talking to all the people he knew and wasn‚Äôt introducing me to anyone (but WAS introducing his brother to people the whole time). I am incredibly socially awkward and shy (which he is aware of and I know is not his responsibility), so I was incredibly grateful when the one person I knew (other than boyfriend and brother) came over to talk to me and hang out. When the clock struck midnight, I did a shot with that friend instead of boyfriend (who had come to sit next to me at that point) and he was super upset with me because of it.


I don‚Äôt know how to move forward without setting myself up for failure. For the most part he is a super loving, kind person who we typically have zero problems communicating. I understand each of the situations is not outright egregious on its own, but I keep asking myself why I‚Äôm so quick to put my needs before him when he can‚Äôt even wait ten minutes to watch a movie with me. What exactly can I depend on him or what will happen when more serious shit happens in the future?

""Just give me a piece of yourself, like a pinky or a toe, so I can stay here in your dreams.""

""How would I do that? Wouldn't it hurt?"" I asked, a grimace on my face.

""No, silly. This is a dream. You can do anything in a dream, just like this.""

He tugged on his thumb in a slapstick way, and it popped right off his hand. There was no blood, no gore‚Äîjust a thumb separated from a hand like in a claymation movie.

He handed it to me, and it felt real‚Äîwarm and soft and so small in my palm. When I glanced back at him, his hand was back to normal, all five digits intact.

I sighed and tugged on my left pinky. It didn't seem to be coming off at all, but when I glanced at the round cheeks of my little brother, I knew I had to try harder. I closed my eyes and focused on the act of removing my pinky from my hand, detaching it in my mind. When I opened my eyes, my left pinky was in my right hand.

I handed it to him, and he examined it for a second before slipping it into his mouth. He didn't chew or even swallow, but it was gone. He ""ate"" it in a sense.

This continued for a while. I would give him small portions of myself so he could hang around. He requested different pieces each night, and it became normal until one night he didn't show up.

I ran through the playpen in the living room, the playground down the street, and even the attic where we put the Christmas decorations. He wasn't anywhere in my dream, and when I woke up, I felt strange, like I was missing something.

After my morning routine, I walked to the kitchen for breakfast. My mom was humming a tune while making coffee, and I bumped into her when I saw my brother sitting in his high chair. He was grabbing at Cheerios on his plate and laughed when he saw me. My mom turned around to clean the spilled coffee, and that was when he winked at me.

1hm8eo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1hm8eo5/feeling_not_good_enough/,Feeling not good enough,"SalamAlaikum everyone..

Sorry this might be a random depressing post haha.. I feel suffocated by my thoughts and anxiety, and I have nobody to talk with to be honest and I thought posting here might help me a bit..

I have been feeling not good enough for the past fee weeks, even tho i have struggled with it for years, it was getting better and life was peaceful, until i got married and it was pretty bad, in a sense that i was divorced a couple months later bc my ex husband wanted to be with his ex girlfriend and marrying me made him realize he loves her‚Ä¶ so made me feel like a test drive..anyway Alhamdulillah post divorce was okay for me, i wasnt attached to him as his ex was involved from the very first week of our marriage. 

Talking stages drains me now, it‚Äôs just a repetitive cycle of getting to know someone and make it halal and involve family etc. 

But my ex husband has said many things about my appearance and weight in the past that started messing with my head. Im not that bad looking to be honest, alhamdulillah Allah blessed me with a decent look, physically as well It‚Äôs not bad, just a bit heavy for my height haha..im a hijabi and i dress modestly. 

Recently i started noticing how every time i go out with my friend, men always talk to her, flirt with her which is odd bc for example, we both go grab coffee and by the cashier we both standing there to pay, but they always seem to ignore me and always joke with her and suggest a new flavour for the coffee and whatnot, we went back to the same shop and this time only I ordered coffee and while waiting for the drink the same staff came and asked her about the drink if she would like to try smth new and she said oh its hers not mine then he looked at me and asked but the energy is different and im not sure what am i doing that makes men not talk to me? Have any girls experienced this before? 

I was thinking, okay, i mean my friend is beautiful yes but im not that bad either, especially we are both mixed kids so we look different from the ppl here. She dresses less modest than iam and more makeup, she is tall and skinnier, louder and maybe body language? I really cant think of other reasons. But its not the issue with my friend ofc and i dont have any jealousy over that, its not a big deal but just smth i noticed alot recently since i came back to my home country after living abroad for years and have been going out with her more often and started noticing these small details. But today i was out with her and it was the same thing, ppl seem to talk to her and flirt.

I took it a bit personal in a sense how im divorced and my ex was pretty harsh for comparing me with his ex which is unfair bc im a hijabi, i dont show my hair or dress like her she dresses up like a total non muslim.. and men never approach me or look/talk to me..


My brain feels foggy and i feel like im missing some points but this is all i can think of right now and honestly in conclusion i just dont think i will ever find love, in haram nor halal way‚Ä¶

Im struggling to accept that maybe i will never be loved in this Dunya or have someone who  genuinely want me. It makes me sad bc girls here (i live in a muslim country) date and started to go out with men and its becoming normalized here that even i who lived abroad was pretty shocked by this big change in a muslim country.. and i think to myself, these hijabis date and go out with their boyfriends now, holding hands and etc and yet they managed to find love and someone who lives them, wants them, and will really do anything for them, while im here doing things the halal way yet this is my result? Not desired by any üòÖ subhanAllah how Dunya works.  

Im not even tempted to date like them bc even if i do i know i wont find someone that will genuinely love me and i feel like giving up this whole idea of finding someone. 

Of course im not saying i want men to come and flirt with me or anything, but even simply talking to me or a little chat that seems like they are interested would be nice no? 

Anyhow, long rent im sorry.. :// just felt like letting it out it‚Äôs been suffocating me for so long. ",3,1735158773.0,MuslimCorner,7,1.0,False

1hm8dse,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hm8dse/tale_of_the_bonny_marie/,Tale of the Bonny Marie,"In the time before the devouring horde, humanity, thinking themselves alone, stretched out among the stars. They made barren worlds habitable, and in generations turned them into paradises. There was no part of the galaxy they considered off-limits.

When the first unmistakable, non-human, artificial signal caught their attention, humanity celebrated. They were no longer alone. While humans were still trying to work out how to respond, _They_ showed up.

Hundreds of thousands of ships, joined together into a traveling city the size of a moon, materialized in a system where humans populated three planets and eight moons. Instead of attempts to communicate, the city broke apart into its constituent ships.

Like a swarm, the ships descended on the planets and moons. Large, rectangular processor ships hung in the sky above the descender ships.

Smaller cubic ships, a kilometer long on each side, headed to the ground and stripped everything they found. Any lifeforms they encountered stood no chance, whether plant, fungus, or animal, megafauna or bacteria. It didn‚Äôt matter to the machines that landed, burrowed down half a kilometer into the crust, then returned to the processor, leaving behind a square crater. The processor ships handled nearly a thousand descenders every second, converting more than six hundred billion kilograms of material into waste. Everything from the descenders they didn‚Äôt keep, came out the back of the processor as a fine, dry powder that circled in the upper atmosphere, blocking out the light of the local star.

That was just the first of hundreds of systems the devouring horde stripped bare. Humanity scrambled to fight back. Every ship they destroyed was replaced in a matter of days and did little to slow the advance of the horde. Knowing what sort of signals to look for, humanity found the traveling city to be the only source of the signals, which made it possible to track their movements as they moved ever closer to humanity‚Äôs cradle.

The fastest ship in all of the human fleets was the Bonny Marie, said to be able to open a warp space so rapidly, and reaching so far across the stars, as to make reality weep. A converted heavy cargo ship, most of her cargo space taken up with her massive warp engines, she wasn‚Äôt as sightly as her name would suggest. Still, she was the only ship to ever pull warp from within a mere handful of kilometers from the event horizon of a black hole. She was also the only ship ever to make it into, and back out of, the horde‚Äôs city of connected ships.

Still, even with her lightning-fast strikes, any damage the Bonny Marie did to the horde was like trying to empty an ocean with a coffee mug. That didn‚Äôt stop her crew from trying, though. With over a hundred landers and two processors confirmed destroyed, they harassed the horde from system to system. It was when the horde was closing in on Sol that the crew decided they needed to do something drastic.

Despite most of her cargo area being filled with the most overpowered engines, the Bonny Marie had more space yet to give. In humanity‚Äôs darkest hour, every available centimeter of her space was filled with multi-gigaton, three-stage hydrogen bombs. To this day, no one knows where they came from or how many there were. Some say they carried nine, others say thirteen, others say fifteen. However, all reports agree that they were all twelve gigaton yield, installed without the shielding due to space constraints, and all attached to a single trigger for concurrent detonation.

The Bonny Marie was waiting for the horde when they phased into the Sol system near Mars. They said their goodbyes to each other and warped into the structure of the devouring horde. At the center of the conglomeration was a massive pile of ore dust.

The captain gave his orders, the pilot took aim, the ship‚Äôs engines shuddered, and the Bonny Marie rammed into the pile of ore, triggering the fusion bombs. The flash of the initial fireball was visible on Earth, the fine dust ore that was not vaporized turned into radioactive shrapnel. Tens of thousands of the horde ships were destroyed in the initial blast, with tens of thousands more rendered inoperable as a result of either the EMP emitted by the blast or by heat and radiation.

It was still too little, too late for Mars, Luna, and Earth, although the weakened horde was slowed, allowing the evacuation of those bodies to continue for many months. It was only after the horde had stripped those bodies and left them in a cloud of the dust of their upper crust that the real damage the nukes had done became obvious.

The new ships they churned out from the irradiated ore failed often, some not even making their first flight from the traveling city. When the horde rejoined the city, almost back to full strength and emitting megacuries of gamma and alpha radiation, they attempted to use their phase-space propulsion to travel to the next system.

Instead, a ripple washed over the horde city at the speed of light, barely perceptible. Behind it, the ships it had passed over exploded violently. Their cores were vaporized and the remnants ranged in size from the finest dust to small pieces less than two centimeters in diameter. For the second time, a calamity of the horde was visible from Earth, or would have been if there had been anyone there to see it, and they could see through the dust that blotted out the sun.

The remaining humans, listening for the sounds of the horde transmissions, heard silence for the first time in nearly two decades. Earth was wiped bare, but humanity had survived and destroyed the horde, the remnants of which have slowly spread out into a faint ring around the planet.

All the survivors have joined together again, and now we find no other signals. It is time for humanity to build new homes, new paradises for our children‚Äôs children. Alone again, we will spread out among the stars in our new ships that use the phase drives we learned from analyzing the horde.

It is with the greatest of honor that I christen humanity‚Äôs new flagship, the Bonny Marie 2. May she lead us to the stars and our uncertain, but promising, future.

I F(17) and my friend M(16) who I‚Äôm going to call Jacob, go to different colleges. We went to the same secondary/high school and we are close friends. Jacob and my other friends have met a lot of new people and I‚Äôve been introduced to a lot of them. Now Jacob talked about this one person, I‚Äôll call them river. They kept talking about how they had a crush on them, and so when I had my birthday party I allowed them to be invited as I hadn‚Äôt met them so we could meet and everyone be introduced.
A while after my birthday party my other friends tell me that river thought I was hot, I didn‚Äôt really care and just ignored it. Now here‚Äôs where I fucked up, I was with them alone for like 10 minutes as no one else was finished with college. Out of the blue river asks me on a date?? Of course I‚Äôm flustered and confused and out of instinct accept. River goes back to college and I‚Äôm telling my friends to come fast to me. My friends come and one says ‚Äúohh river likes youuuu~‚Äù you know, teasing?? So obviously my dumbass assumes they know about the date?? I still wanted to talk to Jacob privately but I wanted to wait for a good moment. 
We ended up in a coffee shop and some of my friends go to the toilet so of course I‚Äôm about to muster up the courage to talk to Jacob privately and guess who walks in?? RIVER so now everyone is talking and I don‚Äôt have a chance to talk. My other friends come back and everyone goes outside the coffee shop to speak to a friend they spotted outside, i stayed inside on my own because everyone left their bags.
In this time RIVER ANNOUNCED TO EVERYONE THAT WE ARE GOING ON A DATE AND THEN LEAVES. Now everyone rush‚Äôs back in and ambushes me about it and I‚Äôm overwhelmed.  Jacob tells me they don‚Äôt really care but I wasn‚Äôt sure of that.

Over the week I handled the situation really badly. I really didn‚Äôt know whether to hide the thing with river or be open about it yk? Like I didn‚Äôt care for them really and expected them to just get over them after it. But that‚Äôs the kicker - the date went REALLY well and.. I actually started to like them after like I‚Äôve never felt so connected to a person? Genuinely I could barely hide it so I spoke about something nice they did in our friend gc and oh my god I wish I didn‚Äôt.
Jacob thought I was boasting and rubbing it in his face and thought I was a prick basically and honestly I see it that way. The whole time I was flickering between saying stuff and not basically made me out to be someone who hid the date and was ignorant about it. We had a long talk and got over it but I still think IATAH especially because I‚Äôm starting to develop actual feeling I didn‚Äôt expect.",1,1735158684.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I am taking over all marketing, event planning, and outreach for our practice. We are Located to Central NJ but service surrounding states. We are led by a CFP, with two more advisors. We are doing well but would like to really increase our marketing push to bring in more clients and quite frankly my boss wasn't really focusing on it. As of right now I have control of all of the social media and website for the practice and the advisors and I'm starting out with just a basic 3 posts per week per advisor, one call to action, one posing a question, and one as a general post each advisor will have different posts focusing on niche markets and highlight different needs. I will be adding linkdin sales navigator for myself to test and have access to a wealth of workshops and event types, as most importantly the funding to do it. We all have niche markets, that range from public safety, nurses, teachers up to HNM charitable pre and post retirees.

Outside of a heavy social media presence, what worked for you? We are aiming for 8-10 coffee hours per year which we can fill, it's really getting good prospects in the door and booking succesful workshops. How did you measure your success and get articulated feedback and analytics on if what you were doing was working. We have a pretty stern compliance but are usually helping in working through something.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Being a mom often means juggling multiple responsibilities. Between school runs, activities, and household chores, many mothers seek careers that offer flexibility. One career that stands out is that of a real estate agent. This profession can empower ambitious moms to create schedules that fit their lifestyles while still achieving financial success.

The real estate industry allows you to work on your terms. As an agent, you can choose your hours and make decisions that cater to your family's needs. This flexibility is crucial for moms who want to be present for their children while pursuing a rewarding career.

Consider the following reasons why becoming a real estate agent can be an excellent choice for ambitious moms:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Flexible Schedule:** You can set your own hours. This means you can work when it's most convenient for you and your family.
- **Unlimited Income Potential:** Your income as a real estate agent can grow without limits. The more effort you put in, the greater your financial reward.
- **Networking Opportunities:** You'll meet various people. Each interaction can lead to new clients or help broaden your professional network.
- **Personal Growth:** This career requires you to learn continuously. As you guide clients through buying and selling homes, you also develop valuable skills.
- **Work from Anywhere:** Real estate work often allows you to operate from home or your preferred location. Whether it‚Äôs from your living room or a coffee shop, you can manage your business.

The Benefits of Real Estate as a Work-from-Home Option for Parents
------------------------------------------------------------------

For parents looking to balance career ambitions with family life, pursuing a career in real estate offers a unique advantage. The flexibility it provides can seamlessly integrate work schedules with children's routines. This is particularly beneficial for those who want to focus on family while still thriving professionally. Here are some of the many advantages of choosing real estate as a work-from-home option.

### Flexible Work Hours

One of the most significant benefits of a real estate career is the ability to set your own hours. You can schedule meetings, showings, and client consultations around your family's needs. This flexibility allows you to be present for important moments, like school events or family outings.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Work from Anywhere

With a real estate career, you don't have to be tied to a traditional office. As long as you have a reliable internet connection and a mobile device, you can work from home, a coffee shop, or even while waiting at the soccer field. This work-from-anywhere model can greatly enhance your quality of life.

### Potential for High Earnings

Real estate agents often enjoy the potential for significant income through commissions. Unlike many traditional jobs with fixed salaries, your earnings can increase with your effort. Successful agents have the potential to earn substantial amounts, enabling you to provide for your family comfortably.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Networking Opportunities

Being in real estate enables you to connect with various people daily. From clients to fellow agents, your network can expand rapidly. This not only supports your business growth but can also lead to friendships and connections that benefit both your personal and professional life.

### Skills Development

Working in real estate equips you with a diverse skill set that can benefit you and your family. You'll learn about negotiation, marketing, and customer service, among other valuable skills. These attributes can be advantageous in many areas of life, from making critical family decisions to managing personal projects.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Family-Friendly Focus

Real estate is inherently about building relationships. As a parent, you understand the importance of trust and communication. These qualities are essential when working with clients in real estate. Not only does this career allow you to leverage your parenting skills, but it can also involve your family in different ways, such as attending open houses together or discussing family needs with clients.

### Limitless Growth Potential

The real estate market can be constantly evolving, opening doors for agents to specialize in several niches. You might choose to focus on residential properties, commercial real estate, or even property management. This versatility means you can chart your path based on your interests and strengths, ensuring your career grows as your family does.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Financial Independence

Another encouraging benefit of pursuing a career in real estate is gaining financial independence. Unlike being an employee, where your paychecks depend on someone else's decisions, as an agent, you have control over your earnings and can create a work-life balance that suits your needs. This independence can foster confidence and empower you in both your career and as a parent.

### Community Impact

Being involved in real estate allows you to positively impact your community. Helping families find homes, supporting local businesses, and engaging in community events makes your work meaningful. You can set a great example for your children about the importance of giving back and being engaged in your surroundings.

1hm83j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hm83j2/water_treatment_advice_wanted_bwt_bestmax/,Water treatment advice wanted (BWT Bestmax?),"Merry Christmas :)

So, I've been looking trough a lot of Reddit posts and been trough a bunch of other info (even asked AI for advice), but I don't yet feel I have a clear answer, so looking for advice.

*The post got rather long, if you want the short version I guess the question is: any advice on getting a BWT Bestmax Premium filter for my coffee water?*

To set the scene: I live in the Netherlands, near Amsterdam. Our tap-water is considered pretty good (no need for bottled water), but it is definitely on the hard side and its parameters are not perfect for coffee making:

|Parameter|Tap water|SCA Standard|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Hardness (mg/L CaCO‚ÇÉ)|143|100|
|Alkalinity (mg/L HCO‚ÇÉ‚Åª)|157|60|
|pH|8.02|7.5|
|TDS (mg/L)|350|150|
|Magnesium (mg/L)|8.57|10|
|Sodium (mg/L)|54.5|10|

For coffee, I do both filter (now automated, with the Fellow Aiden) and espresso (the machine has a small water filter in the tank, I'm not expecting this to do any wonders). I've experienced using different water (bottled or demi) that the taste of my coffee definitely increases. Guess it's important to note my girlfriend, who doesn't nerd out about coffee and has no intentions to do so, also uses the espresso machine (and should preferably be able to fill it up herself as well). What are my options?

* **MIXING** \- From experience and also from calculations, a 1:1 mix with my tap water and bottled low TDS (Spa) OR demi water gets the water near SCA standards and tastes good However, buying bottled water feels both expensive and wasteful (all the plastics), demi water is cheaper but still comes in bottles AND it is hard to buy food-safe demi water where I live (now I've read that the 'not for consumption' stickers are to be taken with a grain of salt, but it still doesn't really sit right).
* **MAKING** \- another option, which I have not tested out yet, is to make my own coffee water, using demi or ZERO FILTERed tab water as a base, and adding minerals via home made or products like third wave. However, again some of the issues mentioned above keep me from easily picking this option: getting food safe demi water is hard(er) and I'll still end up with plastics. In regards to the ZERO filter, that seems to be an expansive hobby considering the TDS of my tap water. But I guess the biggest concerns here are that is seems to be quite a hassle and that I'm pretty sure my GF does not feel like following the 'new regiment' :) 
* **FILTERING** \- I guess I've been building up to what currently seems to be my preference: filtering the water to get my water into the 'agreeable' range. I'm thinking about a BWT Bestmax Premium filter to under my sink that will be attached to my kitchen tap. This seems, on paper, to be a good middle ground between all of the priorities and concerns raised above, especially ease of use. However, I cannot anywhere find some numbers or test results on how this filter actually impacts the water (how much does it change the hardness, etc.), so if anyone has any advice on this, that would be great. Also, since it would be installed to my main tap for drinking water as well, I would be interested to hear experiences on how the filter affects the taste of the water.

Sorry about the long post, I've probably probably had this on repeat in my mind for a little too long :)

Any advice, experiences or tips are very welcome!

That didn't work this time. I also tried disabling any vehicle mods I had and the ship categories mod since I read that can also cause issues. Nothing fixed it. Normally I would go through and disable a few at a time but I have 230+ mods, so I'm hoping someone here can help. Load order is as follows.
