1jafhkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/1jafhkx/weekly_highlights_313_update/,Weekly Highlights (3.13 Update),"Good morning everyone! Matt here with [The Vantage LV](https://thevantagelv.com/), back with another rundown of what‚Äôs new around town. Going forward, there is just going to be one post a week, on Thursday, highlighting everything from my Monday and Thursday newsletters! The posts have been getting stickied, so I want to avoid clutter!

If you appreciate these posts and want to show some love, consider giving me a follow on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thevantagelv/). It's hugely helpful for getting local businesses to give me information and respond to my DMs about when things are opening!

There is certainly no shortage of things to do for this St. Patrick‚Äôs Day weekend, so I wanted to highlight some things a little more off the beaten path. Let‚Äôs get into it!

# Things to Do:

[**Shrek‚Äôs St. Paddy‚Äôs Day Rave**](https://www.brooklynbowl.com/las-vegas/events/detail/shrek-st-patty-s-day-rave-1avjzb0gkmqlo_l?utm_source=thevantagelv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=green-beer-optional-good-times-guaranteed) **(Brooklyn Bowl) | TONIGHT, March 14** ‚Äì A St. Patrick‚Äôs Day rave, but make it Shrek. Expect EDM, themed visuals, and plenty of ridiculousness. If you‚Äôre looking for something chaotic, goofy, and loud, this is it.

[**Sham-Rock The Park**](https://downtowncontainerpark.com/events/sham-rock-the-park-beer-walk/?utm_source=thevantagelv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=green-beer-optional-good-times-guaranteed) **(Downtown Container Park) | Saturday, March 16** ‚Äì A St. Patrick‚Äôs Day celebration featuring live music, festive drinks, and a high-energy crowd.

My name is Ren and I‚Äôm the Reddit guy for [BenchBrawl](https://benchbrawl.com/reddit). BenchBrawl? Yes, BenchBrawl.

What is BenchBrawl? Why are you on Reddit? Why are you asking so many questions?

BenchBrawl‚Äôs a new, interactive, tournament-style betting game. You‚Äôll compete against your friends (or, you know, strangers) instead of the book. Our ‚Äúwho‚Äù story is worth explaining in full, which is why I wrote 800 words on it below.

But we‚Äôre all pretty busy, so here‚Äôs a TLDR:

* BenchBrawl is an interactive tournament-style sports betting game (yes, I know we already said this)
* Our unique scoring system is based on real-time odds
* We‚Äôre currently in BETA, BABY
* That means we want your feedback. Please. We want your opinion on all things BenchBrawl, particularly during our upcoming March Madness contest.
* About the March Madness contest: **it is 1000%, swear-on-my-mother‚Äôs-life free, and we‚Äôre even awarding $850 in prizes to the winners of our March Madness contest.**

Intrigued? Awesome. Not intrigued? Please don‚Äôt yell at me.

Even if you‚Äôre not interested in participating, we‚Äôd still be interested in hearing thoughts on the game below.

**Our Game**

BenchBrawl is a tournament-style, pick‚Äôem competition. In each contest, participants make a set number of picks. Nail a pick? Then you get a set number of points based on the fancy scoring system mentioned above. The Brawler (that‚Äôs you) with the highest cumulative point total at the end of the contest wins.

**Our Story**

Let‚Äôs jump in a time machine, shall we? The idea for BenchBrawl dates all the way back to‚Ä¶oh, just the 2023 NFL season. Anyway, our founder Paul and two good friends were looking pretty much everywhere for a tournament-style NFL pick‚Äôem game. If you can believe it, their options were limited. So, they took matters into their own hands.

They each threw in their weekly, uh, coffee money (about $50). They then made 10 weekly picks apiece from all available and officially posted Sides and Totals. They used a 2-0-1 scoring system for Win-Loss-Push (this is Goodwill Hunting-level math, I know), and they made 180 total picks over the course of the season. When all was said and done, the winner took home the whole $150 pot. I hope you‚Äôre still following along. FWIW, I have a calculator open to confirm all of these numbers.

Following the resounding (three-person) reception to the 2023 campaign, they recruited more participants for the 2024 NFL season. There were now nine (‚ÄúThe Wolfpack,‚Äù no one said except me) and they bumped the buy-in to $100.

Those were the simple changes. Paul wanted to evolve the game, and that required a trip to his my Batcave (aka mostly Excel):

* He wanted the game to appeal to both serious and recreational sports bettors.
* He *needed* to adapt the game so it was more akin to sports betting.
* He naturally wanted to add in Moneyline, and he wanted a scoring system that considered the vigorish (the bookmaker‚Äôs brokerage fee, which me and my homies call the juice, or vig).

Guess what happened. Paul redid the scoring system, dove into some sweet Excel formulas, and launched the revamped game for the 2024 NFL season. Everyone LOVED IT.

Guess what else happened (I suggest playing [Battle Hymn of the Republic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQcy8xktas) while reading the following paragraph). Paul realized this game could appeal to an even bigger group of people. Paul realized that for a small risk, a player could enjoy the fun and excitement of sports betting without losing the, uh, coffee money. Paul realized this approach made each NFL week more engaging and fun.

Oh yea, sports betting was also legalized. This meant there was a now-legal opening for a one-of-a-kind sports game that‚Äôs one half sports betting, one half Daily Fantasy Sports, and one half community (don‚Äôt check my math there).

Paul quickly formed his Justice League. Superman is a very talented web developer. The duo adapted that fancy Excel sheet into what we‚Äôre passing along today: BenchBrawl. The rules are the same, the games are live, and the odds now come directly from a real sportsbook and update every 30 seconds!

**Our Request**

Come play with us.

Okay, maybe that sounded creepy. *Please*, come play with us. We‚Äôre confident you‚Äôll like it.

Yes, there‚Äôs something in it for us. We really, really want your feedback. We want your thoughts on anything and everything: the game, the UI, the presentation, how the Reddit guy is starting to ramble‚Ä¶we want it all.

We truly understand and appreciate that your betting bandwidth is limited. While this contest is **free to participate,** we will still be **awarding $850 in prizes, including $500 to the overall winner.**

‚Äî

Phew, okay, I‚Äôm done. What do you think?

1jaf3qv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jaf3qv,Please help critique our great room remodel.,"Hello everyone, I wanted to get some outside perspective on my planned great room/kitchen/living room makeover for my midcentury ranch. I will try to include as much information as possible, but if more information is needed, please ask! For starters this house is a 1957‚Äôs ranch that has undergone years of bastardization (some by myself, some by others). I did some renovating when I moved into the house 10 years ago, but am now looking to ditch the grey in favor of something that is more cozy that fits the architecture of the home. Over the last ten years I have also become interested in furniture making so I would like to come up with something that lends itself to a variety of wood tones while  tying together the contrast between dark floors and the light kitchen cabinet.. I have put maybe too much thought into things, but I am here seeking further advice to seek out pitfalls I am overlooking.

Things that I am not inclined to change despite not loving them:

The dark floors: I am not refinishing them again and covering them with LVP would likely be a travesty. 

The white ceiling beams: The beams run ‚Äúthrough‚Äù the exterior walls and are visible beneath the eaves. The previous owner had painted the exterior white, and I carried the look into the interior when painting the home. In retrospect, I don‚Äôt love the white, BUT stripping the exterior eave tongue & groove/beams would not have been feasible. I plan to paint the ceilings with a fresh coat of white ceiling paint unless someone strongly compels me to do otherwise.

Kitchen cabinets: I would love to replace the cabinets, but we don‚Äôt intend to live here for longer than five years, so I would prefer to incorporate a solution that updates them, but not 

Things I plan to do broken down by room (in no particular order of importance):

Living room:
Reorient the room: 

Place TV on wall that sectional is currently on. 
Get new furniture that could be oriented to face the new location of the TV. I have kicked around the idea of the Jonathan sofa by Castlery in the configuration included in the photo with the ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù end oriented in a manner that would allow you to sit on the end and look at the fire. My hope is that it's small enough to not dominate the space. Additionally, I would get a swivel lounge chair that could be used to watch TV or swivel around and watch the fire. 
Make built-ins to accent the wall and provide additional storage (Mostly books). (See the two sketchup drawings). These would likely be cherry because it is light enough to mix with the maple cabinets, but ages dark enough to not clash with the oak floors that were stained a walnut tone. 

Fireplace: Rework is required for several reasons:The stone makes up a portion of the fire box which has deteriorated over time allowing smoke to escape into the home when attempting to use the fireplace. I have always had/loved a fireplace (a wood burner, won‚Äôt do gas), and would like to continue to have one, therefore, I intend to replace the fireplace with a high-efficiency insert/blower.

I had the fireplace evaluated by a local company that has an insert to fit the opening. While conversing with them, they recommended rather than deconstructing the stone, fir out the walls and clad them with whatever material I like. I do not relish the idea of covering the stone, but I feel the fireplace is currently pretty tired. I suppose the stone masonry could be repointed, but at this point I intend to cover it as it would allow me to create what I am about to suggest. In the photos you can see the ‚Äúbroom‚Äù storage to the left of the fireplace. I intend to extend the face of the fireplace to accommodate a small countertop to house our coffee maker in an attempt to free up our limited kitchen counter space.  

The new fireplace insert has a shroud/surround that would struggle to lay flush against the irregular surface of the stone, tile would allow for a cleaner install. With that being said, I am considering the pictured tile as I hope it will provide some color while not clashing with the black of the fireplace surround. 
I will also be extending the hearth to meet code (a current deficiency). 

I will make a wood mantel (cherry) at the approximate location of the current mantel that will wrap 90 degrees around the side on the far wall (as it does now). Along the side, I will create a small area to house firewood and a mini bar.  
Paint: Plan on using an off white for the majority of the space (Maybe something less ‚ÄúYellow‚Äù than alabaster). I don‚Äôt want things to appear too sterile, so I am hoping that using varying woods, and a large colored rug will prevent that from occurring.

I am also considering painting the TV wall Sherwin Williams 0016 Billiard Green because I love shaker-ish colors. (Despite the apparent green hate, I am open to any color options)
Trim paint: If we go with the off white, is there a need to paint the trim a traditional ‚Äútrim white‚Äù? Or should I just paint the trim the same color as the walls. Then, if we do that, do I paint the trim the same color as the green on the TV wall? 
Trim: Replace with ‚Öù‚Äù x 5‚Äù flat trim with similar flat door casing. Window ‚Äútrim‚Äù will be discussed below. If we don‚Äôt do shoji screens, then I will plan for drywall window returns as the current window stools are ‚ÄúTennessee pink‚Äù marble. Please recommend ANY window treatment you think would accent the giant windows please! 

Window Treatments: Windows are 198‚Äù wide. I am really wide open to ideas here, but I have somewhat leaned towards making sliding shoji screens consisting of three panels (Similar to image I included) that would allow for them to slide ‚Äúopen‚Äù to one side.

Lighting:
Again, open to suggestions, I am assuming that you all will have some insight here. I am thinking of something black with maybe brass.  

Kitchen: 
Cabinets: Replacing the upper cabinet doors with a squared off profile resembling the lower cabinet profile to ditch the ‚Äúcountry‚Äù arch. I will also change the cornice board over the windows. 

Countertop: Remove the tan speckle and pour concrete countertops to somewhat compliment the kitchen floors, and tie in the grey color of fireplace hearth.  
Backsplash: open to suggestions here.
New bar stools.

1jaf3ja,https://i.redd.it/eg4wo048ahoe1.jpeg,"Indiana Whiskey Company Tour Experience-South Bend, Indiana","
Located in South Bend, Indiana, just a few miles from the historic University of Notre Dame, the Indiana Whiskey Company offers an authentic and engaging distillery tour that combines rich history, hands-on craftsmanship, and a welcoming atmosphere. Founded by a veteran, the distillery prides itself on producing small-batch spirits using locally sourced grains and maintaining a deep connection to the local community.

Tour Experience ‚Äì 7/10

The tour itself is guided by the owners and distillers, which adds a personal touch that‚Äôs hard to find elsewhere. They are passionate about their craft and provide detailed insights into the whiskey-making process, including a close-up look at their unique pot still. The distillers are more than willing to answer questions and share stories about the founding of the distillery and the challenges and triumphs they‚Äôve faced along the way. The historical depth and personal interaction make the tour genuinely special, even though the relatively young age of the spirits might leave seasoned whiskey enthusiasts wanting more complexity.

Spirits ‚Äì 7/10

While the Indiana Whiskey Company‚Äôs spirits are on the younger side, they are well-crafted and flavorful. Their flagship whiskeys are smooth and approachable, but the real highlight lies in their experimental offerings. The Breakfast of Champions whiskey, infused with coffee and maple notes, stands out as a must-try for its creative and bold flavor profile. While the spirits might not have the deep complexity of older whiskeys, they showcase a distinctive character that reflects the distillery‚Äôs innovative spirit.

Bar and Staff ‚Äì 9.5/10

The bar experience at Indiana Whiskey Company is top-notch. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, taking the time to walk guests through the different whiskey profiles and offering thoughtful suggestions. Their passion for the craft is evident, and they go out of their way to make sure everyone feels welcome and comfortable. The bar and production area are clean, well-organized, and inviting, creating a relaxed environment to sample drinks and soak in the atmosphere.

Overall Impressions

The Indiana Whiskey Company strikes a balance between tradition and innovation, combining a deep respect for the craft with creative new approaches. The veteran-owned roots and commitment to using local ingredients give it a strong sense of place and authenticity. While the whiskey‚Äôs youthfulness might not appeal to everyone‚Äôs palate, the creativity in their experimental offerings more than makes up for it.

Final Score:
	‚Ä¢	Tour: 7/10
	‚Ä¢	Spirits: 7/10
	‚Ä¢	Bar and Staff: 9.5/10
Overall Average: 7.8/10

I highly recommend stopping in and visiting them if you‚Äôre in the area ‚Äî it‚Äôs an experience that whiskey lovers and casual drinkers alike will enjoy.

The New Mexico coffee company coffee was liek $22 (I‚Äôve actually ordered it shipped online and it‚Äôs usually never that much even with shipping). And there was a 1 oz bag of hatch chilli powder that was like $10‚Ä¶.i don‚Äôt know if it really is a speciality item or if it was marked up because of the kinda shop it was at. 

I‚Äôm doing a little more sightseeing today and maybe tomorrow morning  and then heading out tomorrow afternoon‚Ä¶.any retail stores in the city that might have these items?

now this is where things go south... my favorite coffee shop said in the interview they wanted someone to start in the next couple weeks and i did not hear back after a week and a half so i thought i wasn't going to get the job but then saw an email from a place i applied to before my previous cafe closed asking to interview me so i said yes. i had the interview with them yesterday and then right after that interview i got an email from my favorite coffee shop saying they're going to hire me but decided they don't need someone to start till April. then i saw an email from the place i interviewed at offering me a job right away and now i'm conflicted because 
1. i don't want to leave my current job even if it's not top notch quality 
2. i have zero excuse to turn down the place i interviewed at since they pretty much offered me a job on the spot and expressed much interest while i was there
3. i found out my friends girlfriend also got a job at the place that offered me a job on the spot and she is awesome so it would be cool to work together 
4. current cafe and favorite cafe owners are friends and i don't want to screw that relationship up

I hope one day we can come back together, whether it‚Äôs as friends or another relationship, because you‚Äôre all that I think about and want to be around. Your happiness is the only thing that matters to me, and I know letting you go was the only thing that could have happened.

It felt like the default life plan like it was just what you do. I‚Äôd tell my friends, ""Maybe someday I‚Äôll have a family,"" but over time, that ""maybe"" turned into excuses.¬† 

At first, I thought, ""Okay, maybe I‚Äôll do the whole thing, yk go to college, graduate, get a job, find a partner, get married, and have kids."" But even then, it didn‚Äôt feel like something I actually wanted it just felt like what I was supposed to do. As I got older, my thoughts started to shift. I started thinking, ""What if I don‚Äôt get married but still have kids? Maybe through a one-night stand or a sperm donor? Or maybe I‚Äôll just adopt?"". It was like I was trying to find a version of motherhood that felt less overwhelming, less not me. But even those ideas didn‚Äôt sit right. They felt like compromises, like I was still trying to fit myself into a mold that didn‚Äôt belong to me. The idea of being pregnant scared the shit out of me, and the thought of raising kids felt like a burden I didn‚Äôt want to carry. I kept trying to convince myself there was a way to make it work, but deep down, I knew it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted.¬† Now, at 24, I‚Äôm a licensed PT, graduated with awards, and still haven‚Äôt had a boyfriend or been in any sexual relationships. I‚Äôve always been super focused on my education and career.

 And thanks to TikTok, I‚Äôve finally realized something,¬† motherhood isn‚Äôt for me.¬†I came across videos of women talking about their decision to be child-free, and it was like a lightbulb went off. For the first time, I saw people who looked like me, who felt like me, and who weren‚Äôt ashamed to say, ""I don‚Äôt want kids."". It wasn‚Äôt just about not wanting the responsibility, it was about understanding myself.¬† I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm a selfish person, and I‚Äôm okay with that. I want to live for myself. I want to wake up every day and do what makes me happy, not what society or anyone else expects of me. I don‚Äôt want to spend my life caring for someone else when I know I don‚Äôt have the capacity for it. My energy, my time, my love, I want to pour all of that into my own dreams and passions.¬† 

My ultimate dream is to travel the world, live in Switzerland, ride my bike through the mountains. I want to explore new places, meet new people, and just live life on my own terms. I want to wake up in a cozy little apartment, make myself a cup of coffee, and spend my days doing what I love whether that‚Äôs working as a PT, hiking through the Alps, or just enjoying the quiet moments. Some people might call that selfish, and you know what? I‚Äôm fine with that. Because being ""selfish"" means I‚Äôm choosing myself. It means I‚Äôm not settling for a life that doesn‚Äôt fulfill me just because it‚Äôs what‚Äôs expected. I‚Äôm not afraid to grow old and alone because I know I‚Äôll have lived a life full of adventure, freedom, and self-discovery.¬† 

I remember this one time in middle school when my best friend and I were talking about our futures. She said she wanted to build a family and raise kids, and I remember thinking, ""I don‚Äôt see myself in that future."" At the time, I brushed it off, thinking I‚Äôd ""change my mind"" as I got older. But now, I realize that deep down, I‚Äôve never wanted that. I just pushed those feelings aside because it felt like the only path forward.¬† Fast forward to now at 24, still firm in my decision. My friends are all about marriage and family planning, and while I‚Äôm happy for them, I‚Äôve been honest about my own goals or lack thereof. Yet, I keep hearing, ""You‚Äôll change your mind when you‚Äôre older."" But what if I don‚Äôt? Why does it bother people so much when someone doesn‚Äôt want the same things they do?. I‚Äôm glad I live in a time where I can explore these ideas and feel validated in my choices. It‚Äôs not just about not wanting kids, it‚Äôs about understanding who I am and what I want out of life.¬† ",1,1741879900.0,offmychest,0,0.66,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

As I've engaged with people across the political spectrum, I have noticed that regardless of your views, we all generally really appreciate the outdoors.  That's one of the coolest aspects of the area.   So in an effort to help us all work together to improve certain aspects of the valley, a handful of us have noticed excessive light pollution that is starting to hinder revenue streams in some of our key industries.  While we need individuals to act as individuals and do their part to reduce artificial light at night in their homes or areas of influence, we also need some level of outreach to all parties regardless of political association, to curb artificial light at night.  We are not asking for the complete deletion of lights at night, because we know that will never ever happen.  However, we do believe that thoughtful and intentional uses could be adopted.  As a result, there has been a recent collective of people from all walks of life (lots of conservatives too) that see the value of thoughtful light use at night, and they've created a coalition...

  
may I introduce [https://grandvalleydarkskyinitiative.org/](https://grandvalleydarkskyinitiative.org/)

  
Anyways, I know a handful of people have been asking about how to get involved.  I ask that you first start out by finding ways to curb your own light pollution in your controllable space.  Find out ways you can easily accomplish this here:  [darksky.org](http://darksky.org)

I'd also encourage you to educate your neighbors in a polite way.  I personally, went out a purchased LED lights of the yellow (warm) waveform spectrum for my neighbors to use on their porches.  These yellow waveform lights are drastically less invasive, and will be drastically better to keep nighttime pollinators, mammals and your own circadian rhythm in check, so you won't have to question why your testosterone is dangerously low, or wonder why you have to consume so much coffee or redbull, etc.  

Again, let's rally around the Grand Valley Dark Sky Initiative to help conserve the farmland around us that we all seem to appreciate, the vast and amazing outdoor infrastructure that we all use for recreation and revenue, as well as our own sanity.  ",15,1741879768.0,grandjunction,2,0.89,False

The worst part was the Dad's. They fuck off to drink and don't participate in any of the parenting responsibilities at weddings. 

A 14 year old daughter was doing more to feed the baby and entertain toddlers while the Mom rangled the other kids. The 14 year old didn't get to be a kid, she didn't get to dance, or take pictures in the photo booth. She was parentified. I felt so bad for her. How soon did this start for her? How much of her childhood has she already lost from this? 

And the cascade of rage flowed freely within me. This isn't a one off occurrence either. The number of times I've worked a wedding and a Mom is crying because she's exhausted and hasn't gotten to sit down to eat while the Dad is off with his buddies. Or both parents fuck off and event staff is stuck disciplining your children from toppling the wedding cake.

Kids ended up breaking a coffee table at the reception. (Why have glass coffee tables at a wedding but that's another story). Dad didn't even look up from his conversation.

1jaekf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TomSgFit/comments/1jaekf0/keep_your_tech_belongings_safe_while_studying_in/,Keep Your Tech Belongings Safe While Studying in Public,"When you're focused on studying or working in public spaces like coffee shops, libraries, or co-working hubs, the last thing you want to worry about is someone walking away with your expensive laptop or tablet. 

Unfortunately, public workspaces create perfect opportunities for theft. For example, you're distracted, there's constant movement around you, and your valuable devices are on display. Anti-theft backpacks offer a practical solution to this common problem, giving you peace of mind while you concentrate on your work.



# How Anti-Theft Backpacks Protect Your Valuables

**Hidden Zippers and Access Points**

Traditional backpacks have zippers on the outside where anyone can easily open them. Anti-theft backpacks are designed differently. Their main compartment zippers rest against your back while you're wearing the bag. 

This simple design change means that when you're working, no one can quietly unzip your bag without you noticing. Some models go further with locking zippers that require a combination or key to open, adding another layer of security.



**Cut-Proof Materials**

Regular backpack materials like nylon or polyester can be easily cut with a knife or sharp object. Thieves sometimes slash the bottom or side of a bag to grab what falls out. 

Anti-theft backpacks use specially reinforced fabrics with embedded steel mesh or wire that prevents cutting. Even if someone tried to slash your bag while you're distracted, they wouldn't be able to break through the protective layer.



**RFID Protection Technology**

Modern thieves don't always need physical access to steal from you. RFID skimming devices can scan and capture information from credit cards, ID cards, and passports from several feet away. Many anti-theft backpacks include RFID-blocking pockets made with special materials that block these scanning signals. 

When you place your wallet or passport in these protected pockets, digital thieves can't access your personal information.



**Secure Device Compartments**

Your laptop and tablet are likely your most valuable possessions when studying in public. Anti-theft backpacks feature padded, reinforced compartments specifically designed for these devices. These sections are often positioned toward the back of the bag, making them difficult to access when the bag is worn. 

Some models include additional straps or locks for these compartments, ensuring your computer stays secure even if someone manages to open the main section of your bag.



**Physical Security Features**

One of the most useful innovations in anti-theft backpacks is the inclusion of security cables or anchor points. These built-in steel cables allow you to loop your bag around a table leg, chair, or other fixed object. 

This prevents someone from simply grabbing your entire backpack and running off when you step away to order another coffee or use the restroom. 

For students working in libraries or coffee shops, this feature alone can provide significant peace of mind.



# Additional Benefits Beyond Security

**Organization and Device Protection**

Beyond their security features, most anti-theft backpacks offer excellent organization systems. Multiple compartments help you keep your books, notebooks, pens, and electronics neatly arranged and easily accessible. 

The padded laptop compartments also protect your devices from accidental bumps or drops, serving both security and safety purposes.



**Comfort and Durability**

Many anti-theft backpacks are designed with ergonomic features like padded shoulder straps, back support, and weight distribution systems. 

Since these bags are built with premium materials to resist cutting and tearing, they tend to be more durable than standard backpacks, potentially lasting years longer despite daily use.



**Weather Resistance**

Most high-quality anti-theft backpacks incorporate water-resistant materials and covered zippers. This additional protection helps keep your electronics and study materials safe from unexpected rain or spills, which is especially important when carrying expensive technology.



# Is An Anti-Theft Backpack Worth The Investment?

While anti-theft backpacks typically cost more than standard bags, consider the value of what you're protecting. A single laptop can be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars, not to mention the irreplaceable value of your assignments, thesis work, or business projects stored on it. 

From this perspective, the added investment in security makes practical sense.

For high school and college students who regularly study in public spaces, an anti-theft backpack provides genuine value. The security features allow you to focus more on your studies and less on watching your belongings. This improved concentration can lead to better study sessions and less stress overall.



# Smart Safety Habits To Complement Your Secure Backpack

Even with an anti-theft backpack, maintaining awareness of your surroundings remains important:



* Keep your backpack in sight whenever possible
* Use the security cable when you need to step away briefly
* Consider using additional security devices like laptop locks for extra protection
* Don't leave your devices unattended in very crowded or unfamiliar places
* Be cautious about displaying expensive technology in high-risk areas



An anti-theft backpack works best as part of a broader awareness of personal security, giving you an important advantage against opportunistic theft while you focus on your studies or work.

Have you ever experienced that moment of panic when you realized you left your backpack unattended, even for just a minute? With an anti-theft backpack, those moments become much less stressful, allowing you to concentrate on what really matters‚Äîyour education and productivity.



# Do You Really Need One?

If you regularly work or study in public spaces, an anti-theft backpack adds an extra layer of security. While no bag is 100% theft-proof, these features make it significantly harder for someone to steal your stuff.



üîπ Pro Tip: Always keep your bag in sight, avoid leaving valuables unattended, and use a laptop lock if possible.

Hello lovely humans!  I've been dropping in to my favorite subreddits to collect willing ~~victims~~ participants for this art...thing I'm working on.

How it started: [Link to first video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4o6urkBRVoY)

How it's going: [Link to latest video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nWwzmnDOEbE)

**EXPLANATION OF PROJECT**

Sonder is a word from the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows, and this is their definition:

*‚ÄúSonder*

*n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own‚Äîpopulated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness‚Äîan epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you‚Äôll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.‚Äù*

We are each of us alone in the cavern of our own skull. We can try to explain ourselves to each other in words, but in the end I‚Äôll never know how it feels to be you, and you‚Äôll never know how it feels to be me, no matter how much empathy we might have for each other. It‚Äôs a lonely feeling. I keep thinking about the AIDS quilt. If you haven't ever looked at it before, you can find it [here](https://www.aidsmemorial.org/interactive-aids-quilt). It is the most perfect representation of the word ‚ÄúSonder‚Äù that I have ever found.

The other thing I‚Äôve been thinking about a lot lately is the tendency of people to treat others as NPCs in their own personal video game. It‚Äôs obviously not a new thing for humans to do, but with the rise of AI writing and AI art, I see more and more people online accusing each other of not being real in a whole new scary way. I‚Äôve seen the most arbitrary criteria levied against posts to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that they were made by AI. Of course AI generated stuff does exist, but I don‚Äôt think people are as good at spotting it as they think they are. I feel like the default position should be kindness, rather than flailing around to prove that everyone else is a robot except for you. So that‚Äôs why I decided to start this project.

Whenever I‚Äôm stuck in an art rut, I like to draw weird little faces. I have over 100 now, and I‚Äôve just been keeping them in an origami box and not doing anything with them. But I think maybe this could be a good way to begin to start to represent a tiny piece of the enormity of the idea that is sonder. I asked my friends to choose a face and think of one thing they would want to tell the world about themselves, and I started to make these tiny books that you see in the photographs, each one unique and representing the entirety of a life, the same way the AIDS quilt does.

**HOW YOU CAN PARTICIPATE**

Since I already have so many drawings, I thought I‚Äôd start collecting words from people on the internet. So if you would like to participate, please either comment here, DM me, or comment on the Youtube video linked at the top of the post with the following:

* Your first name (it doesn‚Äôt have to be your real name, but you should pick a name that you feel represents you)
* What you would like me to write inside the card. The way I think of it is, if I had one chance to tell the world something about my existence, what would I say?
* If you like, you can choose a specific face be telling me the letter and number, battleship style,or I can just pick one for you.
* I would also be happy to make individual videos telling longer stories, so if you have a story I can read in under 3 minutes, please feel free to reach out!

I've realised that I can only work on about 10 of these at a time, so if more than 10 people comment I will use a random number generator to pick 10 comments. This is just something I do in my spare time, so I don't wanna get burnt out by it. 

 if you want to make your own cards for people please feel free to post them to the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebookofsonder/) as well! I definitely don't own this idea, and I honestly think the more people who want to do it the better, because I think it can only ever be a good thing for people to think of other humans as...human.

Even if you don't want to draw weird faces, I think it's still awesome just to do index cards, because when you're having a bad day you can look through them and remind yourself that even though you may think you're not making any difference to the world, small acts of kindness and creativity add up over time.

I like the thought that, once I'm dead, all the cards and the record of them will remain, and the one that is me will be indistinguishable from any of the others. Maybe while I'm alive I'll be able to make all the art I want to make, the way I want to make it. But even if I can't, it will all end up in some thrift store and maybe some future stranger will come across it and be touched by all these tiny slices of human lives

1jaehj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jaehj8/if_you_saw_something_no_you_didnt/,"If You Saw Something, No You Didn't.","That‚Äôs the first rule they teach you in these woods, especially as a forest ranger. It‚Äôs not some quirky saying, it‚Äôs the rule. You learn fast that the things you think you see are better left buried deep in the back of your mind. Because when you start asking questions about those things, when you start telling people about them, bad things happen. Real bad.

I‚Äôve been a ranger for almost five years now, and I'd like to say that I have a handle on things. The forest is peaceful, a place to lose yourself, to think. Sure, there‚Äôs the occasional weird noise in the distance, the rustling of leaves in the dead of night when there's no wind, the flicker of movement out of the corner of your eye. But that‚Äôs just nature, right?

Well, two weeks into the job, I found out firsthand why we have that rule.

I was doing my regular rounds, checking the perimeter, making sure the trail markers were still intact, and that the cabins were locked up tight. The usual stuff. There‚Äôs a trail about five miles into the woods that people like to hike, a perfect place for a little solitude and quite picturesque. It‚Äôs calm out there, quiet. You don‚Äôt expect anything to happen in a place like that.

But that day, something felt off. The trees felt taller, the air heavier. It was a late afternoon, and while the sun should‚Äôve been setting soon, it felt like it was setting faster than usual. I shook it off, focused on the job. As I was picking up an empty bag of chips from the trail the wind picked up, making the trees sway and creak. But then... something caught my eye. Just off the path, I saw movement. A figure. It wasn‚Äôt a person, but it also didn't look like any animal I've seen. A silhouette, shifting behind the trees, far enough that I couldn‚Äôt make out details but close enough that I knew it was there. 

My heart skipped a beat, but I forced myself to think it was just some lost hiker, maybe an animal moving in the underbrush. I called out, but the forest swallowed my voice, the wind carrying it away. I stepped off the path and approached the area where I thought I‚Äôd seen it, but when I reached the spot, there was nothing. Just woods, silent and empty. I searched for a few seconds but found no footprints, no signs of anyone or anything being there just a few moments ago.

I started walking back toward the trail, and then I heard it. Footsteps behind me, light, as if someone was following just a few paces behind. My pulse quickened. I turned to see who, or what, it was. Nothing. I‚Äôm not an idiot. I knew better than to ignore it, so I quickened my pace. I tried to convince myself it was the wind, a trick of the mind, but the footsteps didn‚Äôt stop. They stayed right there, shadowing mine, perfectly in sync. And then it stopped. The sudden silence, minus the crunch of my boots on the trail, made the whole situation even more terrifying.

I paused for a moment, too scared of what may happen if I turned around now. So many choices ran through my head until I decided on one. Well, I wouldn't say I decided, more like my body chose for me. A surge of adrenaline pushed me to start speed walking back to the ranger station; something in me screaming that if I started running, I'd be dead. My heart pounded as if I was in a marathon, with each stride goosebumps formed. The crisp wind moving my hair to my face and carried the scent of vanilla through the air. The smell reminding me that any animal could find where I am, especially the thing following.

I reached the station and locked the door. After a few minutes of nothing, I sat behind the desk, chuckling at myself for getting all worked up, and for believing the other rangers' stories. A couple of them even went as far as to claim they saw stuff. At first, I thought they were just trying to mess with the new guy and get him all scared before the first watch. In that moment of giggling at their stories, I realized one of them is lining up exactly like what happened outside. The following footsteps, the feeling of being stared down, the shadow. Even the time of year is exactly when they said it happened. Trying to clear my mind from that, I decided to examine the trail cam footage on the old monitor. It was the most peaceful part of the job, just stare at the footage and take notes of the animals. A bit too peaceful given the fact I fell asleep in front of the screen for a little.

A loud noise jolted me out of my sleep, causing me to fall out of the chair. I picked myself off the floor and walked over to the window to investigate. Flipping on the floodlights outside the cabin, and see a large branch lying just in front of the porch. At first, I brushed it off, it's a forest and branches break all the time, only to immediately remember the fact the station is in the middle of a small clearing. The only way a branch that size would end up here is during a hurricane, and it most certainly was not raining. A multitude of reasons raced through my head, anything that could rationally explain how this hunk of wood got there. I walked away from the window over to the coffee bar, landing on the reason being a giant gust of wind flinging the branch to its spot. Taking a sip of my coffee and quietly humming to myself, I situate myself back into the semi-comfortable computer chair. A few more reports later and I'm back to watching the cameras and naming new faces. A sow, Moon, gave birth earlier in the year and the rangers fell in love with the two cubs due to their fur making it look like Light has eyebrows and Shine has a little mustache. So, one of my duties tonight is to try and spot them and update their information. 

After 3 hours I almost gave up hope, but then I saw movement around the cave Moon had chosen as her home for four years in a row. But it wasn't her. It looked almost like a deer, only the deer was trying to act human. Standing on its two hind legs and with a hunched back, it walked around the flattened area. Its eyes glowing bring in the night vision lens every time it looks in the direction of the camera. Then it paused. Sniffed in the air and looked straight at the camera. I jumped back, shocked at the accurate eye contact made through the screen. I readjusted my chair and continued to watch whatever this thing was, writing down every detail I could get while it was still visible.  The creature started walking towards the tree that the camera was perched on, its steps slow and deliberate. Once it reached the trunk the thing raised its hands the the bark and started shoving. Each push causes the tree, and therefore the camera, to shake immensely.

I stood up and pushed the chair back, the fear truly setting in. Quickly grabbing the walkie on my belt, I call into the closest station near me. Surely someone else is seeing this. The only problem was all the channels I tried were off, or at least that's what I assumed. At the time it didn't make sense. When the 5th station was also static I gave up that plan. I looked back at the screen and see the creature's shoving had only gotten more aggressive. By the looks of it the poplar was rocking back and forth at this point. Then just in the distance the loud sounds of groaning, cracking, and popping cut through the air. Moments later a loud crash followed and the camera was no longer in signal. With no other plan in mind, I scribble the events unfolding into the notebook. Semi-worried no one would believe me, semi-worried this will be the pages that the police would find for evidence.

The chaos didn't stop there. Not even ten minutes later another trail cam, the one filming the trail I checked earlier, showed movement. This activity was different though. The dark shape moved quickly, too quickly, back and forth in front of the camera. As if it was playing with it. I continued my notes until I glanced up and saw it staring right at me again. It's face closer than before. Close enough that I could truly see what creature was out there. It wasn't a deer, not completely anyway. It's head was shaped like a German shepherd's and eyes sat too close at the front of its face, once again glowing in the night vision. The sight of this thing making me scream. I slap my hands over my mouth and stare at the computer screen. The creature was now looking in the direction of the cabin. 

My eyes clench shut as a few tears run down my face. The fear taking complete hold of me. Quiet sobs left my mouth as I checked the camera once again.

It's gone.

You'd expect my reaction to be relief. It was not. To the depth of my core I knew it wasn't really gone. All I could think was, 

""It's coming here. It's coming for me.""

I started rummaging through the drawers of the desk, wincing at every squeak of the steel as they open. In the left bottom drawer I found an spiral notebook with no cover page, the first thing written talking about specific animals to avoid due to temperament, I almost tossed it aside but the loose cover page at the bottom of the drawer caught my eye.

'In Case of ALL Emergencies'

At this point anything could help, plus this should count as one of the emergencies...right? Thank God for whoever was looking out for me because the 2nd page in the notebook I learned there is a specific flare gun behind the antique picture of the forrest. I run over to the wall and take down the picture, setting it on the mantel of the fireplace. And just like the notebook said, a small recessed shelf hidden behind the picture held a red flare gun with three rounds sitting next to it. Realizing I neglected to read what to do with the flare, I hurry over to the book again and see at the bottom in red,

""In the case of Unique Emergencies: fire three shots into the sky.""

The sound of leaves crunching loudly catches my attention and breath. I stand there, paralyzed in terror, unsure of what to do. I can't go outside. I can't fire it in here. If I open a window to fire it will definitely get to me before I could shoot the second let alone the third. The lack of options getting to my head, I began to pace back and forth. Then the steps outside stilled, replacing the sound with jagged breathing. Through the monitor I can see the creature was standing in the middle of the small gravel parking lot, staring at the station with its head tilting ever so slightly. 

I run into the back office, flare gun and cartridges in hand, and lock the doorknob and the two deadbolt locks. I always thought these were for bear attacks. But it seems situations like these have happened before. Looking around the tattered office, I hoped to find anything that could help me. I noticed that the light hadn't been turned on and look up to see a skylight with a small black handle. I grab the step ladder and reach for the handle to see which way it opens. Twisting it slowly, I gently push up and it doesn't budge. The bookcase in the office was at the perfect height and spot to sit with your foot on the step stool for balance, so I did just that. I pushed a little harder but it still didn't budge, on a whim a tried pulling it open and it worked! 

Pulling the cartridges out of my pocket, I open the window just enough to aim the flares at the sky. I load the first one and aim it at the moon.

One down.

With the other two in my hand I quickly reload another cartridge and squeeze the trigger.

Two. One more to go.

The sound of a loud stomp from the roof almost caused me to drop the last round. I quickly caught it a shoved the round into the flare gun, the sound of heavy footsteps nearing me raising my adrenaline and causing me to shake. I aim at the moon again and pull. 

Last one,  help is coming.

I slam the window shut and twist the handle to lock just as the creature jumped into view. It stared at me through the glass, it's eyes wide enough to see the whites. The thing open it's mouth into to what I can only assume was a smile, revealing unnaturally sharp teeth, opened its mouth and let out a scream I would describe as a shrieking whistle. I cower and end up falling off the bookshelf, my landing cushioned by the scattered reports and other papers. Groaning, pull myself into the fetal position and wait for one of two things.

1. Help comes and somehow rescues me
2. This thing makes me it's next meal

The sound of hooves slamming on the glass had me leaning toward the latter being more realistic. I rock myself,  each slam of its hooves making me wince. It didn't take long for the sound of the glass starting to crack to fill the air. I hold my breath, unprepared for what horror lay in store.

Then I heard it. The sound of multiple vehicles from all around the cabin swiftly pulling up and the stomping stopped. Sounds of car doors slamming and three gun shots rang in the air. I looked up at the skylight and the creature was gone. The rangers from the other station banged on the front doors, it took me a minute to compose myself then I let the in. Immediately they asked me what happened, I told them everything that happened as best I could and showed them my notebook for my details. I asked what that thing was and they said it's best if I don't ask things I don't want to know. 

""Next time, ignore it."" A ranger chuckled out and playfully threw his arms on my shoulders, ""remember the golden rule, if you think you see something,  no you don't. "" 

I live by those words now and have kept out of trouble, for the most part, these past years. So, if you're reading this, consider it as an example of why we have this rule...and good luck.",4,1741879348.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1jaeglc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SamRobertsShow/comments/1jaeglc/cold_brew_is_for_pansies/,Cold brew is for pansies.,"I just want to reiterate that cold brew coffee is for men who lack testosterone. Studies have shown that men who drink the cold brew enjoy  the foamy mustache above their lip and usually turn to homosexuality after only 2 cold brews. The foamy mustache has caused an uptick in male yeast infections. 

This is concerning for males because the yeast infections are also causing anal leakage  and males do not have an approved tampon or pad to control the seepage.

What we do know is black hot coffee gives you more testosterones.Men who drink the hot beverage report penis growth and Improved brain function. This goes without saying but the black hot drinkers can drink a boiling hot cup with no injury to their mouths while the cold brew drinkers have to call their moms after just taking a sip of the hot stuff.

In conclusion cold brew is destroying masculinity and is in fact fueling the trans epidemic. Drink hot black coffee if you don't want your testes to retract into your abdomen.

1jaefda,https://www.reddit.com/r/wnba/comments/1jaefda/who_had_diana_article/,Who Had Diana? (Article),"By Maitreyi Anantharaman

For a brief, unthinkable time in her life, Diana Taurasi was the measured, not the stick. A bulletin from 1999 tells of a 5-foot-11 junior guard at Don Lugo High School who rebounds, blocks, and steals, but mostly shoots. At a recent tournament, she won four straight games at the buzzer. Check her out sometime. She might be ""the next Michelle Greco""‚Äîmaybe even better.

Before 10,000 points, three WNBA rings, five scoring titles, three NCAA championships, six Olympic golds‚Äîbefore she retired from basketball this February as the first Diana Taurasi and the last Diana Taurasi‚ÄîDiana Taurasi was the dreamed-on daughter of Argentine immigrants in Chino, Calif. Lily waited tables at a Sizzler; Italian-born Mario built airplane parts in a factory. Maybe you can guess her first love. ""Whenever the World Cup comes around, it's like our family dies for a whole month‚Äîyou don't hear from anyone,"" Taurasi once said. Soccer vied for her talents. For a brief, unthinkable time, Diana Taurasi's attention was divided.

She spent the rest of her athletic life making up for this sin. Sweeping words like ""history"" and ""legacy"" crop up around her, but those words are all big and flat and wide and wrong, and they miss the miracle of her game, which was played free of context. It didn't matter whether women's basketball was a punchline, or something billionaires on panels talked about between heady bursts of applause‚ÄîTaurasi was only ever focused on one thing. Ambition comes in many shapes. Hers was thrillingly narrow.

At Don Lugo, Taurasi honed the muscular jump shot, quick tongue, and sharp elbows that would vex and astonish basketball fans for a generation. Eventually Mario nudged her to focus on hoops, a gesture she reads now as both love and immigrant shrewdness: There was a future in basketball for Diana. She leapt at it so quickly that when she opened her first recruiting letter in eighth grade, from Walla Walla Community College, she made up her mind to go there.

But she didn't, nor did she take the path of Crescenta Valley High School's own Michelle Greco, who stayed home at UCLA and played one season with the Seattle Storm. To her mother's dismay‚ÄîStorrs was ""so dark ‚Ä¶ like a scary movie,"" Lily said‚ÄîTaurasi ended up a world away at Connecticut, where two singular figures began the bond of their basketball lives. UConn coach Geno Auriemma claimed in his 2006 memoir, and has said in other words often since, that Taurasi ""challenged me as much as any player I've ever had."" So alike in their moods were they that teammates called her ""Little Geno."" Here, at last, was someone proud and Italian enough for the other. ""Geno's natural walk is a strut,"" Rebecca Lobo said. Taurasi's poker face is a grin.

Two children of immigrants, they grew up unmoored, caught in the same knots of misunderstanding. ""I've already lived your life,"" Auriemma told the hotshot recruit. ""Your parents have no idea, do they?"" The coach courted Mario with fluent Italian and canny taste in wine. He was, to Diana, what even a 16-year-old girl knows is rare: a man prepared to take her seriously.

Taurasi gives greatness a silhouette: the taut bun and sharp nose that draw her face into a diamond. Terror, tormentor‚Äîthe stories thrum with fear. In opponents' tellings, she's a kind of monster. After the worst game of her life in the 2001 Final Four as a freshman, she vows never to lose another tournament game at UConn, and she doesn't. ""Call me,"" she mouths as a junior, thumb and pinkie and all, to the Cameron Crazies at Duke, the undefeated, No. 1 team she just defeated on the road. Against Tennessee that year, she drives, draws the foul and punches the stanchion. She tells reporters afterward, ""I just wanted to hit something orange.""

The funny secret, still kept by the name on the front of the jersey, is that Taurasi played her last two college seasons in a fallow time for the program. By the standards of UConn women's basketball, the 2003 and 2004 rosters were nothing special. Taurasi was the only Husky on the first All-Big East team those years. (As a sophomore, she'd started alongside two Hall of Famers.) Mostly she had the help of Ann Strother, a sweet and undersung forward from Colorado who had a cup of coffee in the league before becoming a nurse practitioner. Strother hit the shot before the shot before the shot‚Äîthe 22-footer Diana Taurasi made running in from the sideline to send a Jan. 4, 2003 game against Tennessee to overtime. UConn's 50-game win streak stayed alive. ""When you have a Diana Taurasi,"" Pat Summitt said afterward, ""you're never out of it.""

Even aughts-era VHS, free as it is of detail, can't hide the modernity of Taurasi's game. To watch it now is startling, like the plastic water bottle they forgot to edit out of Downton Abbey. The jump shots vary in stake and distance, but they share that mechanically consistent core of power, flair and economy. It is the irony of her career that someone whose greatness depended so little on the nine players around her was never not exactly aware of her position among them. To the day she retired, Taurasi was one of the game's best guard screeners and a gifted, instinctual cutter. If she didn't need other people, other people could still flatter her. The backcourt she built with Phoenix Mercury teammate Cappie Pondexter was a yearslong blur of stunning movement and self-creation. She made her first WNBA playoff run with coach Paul Westhead, whose uptempo style highlighted her gift for passing. Another lucky match was Shabtai Kalmanovich, a former KGB spy and the wealthy sponsor of the Spartak Moscow basketball club, where Taurasi played overseas for huge paydays from 2006 to 2010.

The luckiest match was early: Only a few months before they'd pick Taurasi in the 2004 WNBA draft, the Mercury held the first overall pick in the Cleveland dispersal draft. They selected Penny Taylor, a great player in her own right, and the woman Taurasi would marry. Now parents to two children, they wed in 2017, a year after Taylor retired. But for a decade they played alongside each other, Taylor the steely counterpart to expressive Dee. ""Penny diving on the floor at her age, it's impressive,"" Taurasi told reporters in a postgame interview at the 2014 Finals. Beside her, Taylor rolled her eyes and gave Taurasi's shoulder a whack. ""Two weeks older than her, mind you,"" Taylor huffed.

Taurasi developed a brand of physical comedy that not everyone found funny. It was rich in shoving, with an occasional kick mixed in. Hunting for certain footage, I can only admire the passive voice employed in the report ""Davenport Nose Broken By Taurasi Elbow."" (For this Taurasi-involved elbowing, the league assessed her one of a WNBA-record 122 technical fouls.) Auriemma clocked it early: what a person gets up to when they spend so much of their life alone, stewing in their own talents. He saw right through Dee's ""con."" She makes mischief. Curiosity steals over her. She's desperate to know what she can get away with.

In 2009, a few hours after beating the Storm one night in July, Taurasi was arrested for a DUI, and the Mercury suspended her for two games. She has called this the start of the most trying time in her life. ""If it's something you love to do, you should never put it in jeopardy, and for a minute there I did,"" she said. She felt newly awake to the irresoluteness of life, and that feeling would only deepen in the coming months. Taurasi won her second championship that October, in a high-scoring Finals that announced a new era of WNBA offense. The same year, she won her first and only MVP award. It is proof of the league's stylistic tendencies, and the talent required to break them, that no true guard has won since. As usual, Taurasi played in Russia that offseason, but it would be her last with Spartak. That November, Kalmanovich was shot and killed outside the Kremlin, and she remembers driving past the scene, seeing the dark cloud of bullet holes in his car window. ""There he was,"" she said. ""Hunched over dead."" She'd spend the next two years defending herself against a doping charge later dropped and retracted by the lab. She was cleared in time to compete in the London Olympics, where she won her third of six gold medals.

The terms of a women's basketball career are their own check against longevity. Low pay and high stress compound. They dare you to stay. Two whole decades of pro play set Taurasi apart from contemporaries who challenge her claim to ""greatest."" Maya Moore won easily and rapidly, but didn't play half as many seasons. These days Elena Delle Donne, the best shooter of her time, just makes sweet Instagram reels of her dog.

Does it come naturally to her? ""Hold it in, babe,"" Taurasi tells Taylor, who is pregnant with Isla and due any minute. She has just won Game 5, Vegas, the semifinals, 2021. After the win and interview, Taurasi points to the camera, flings off the headset, and rushes home to her wife. Hold it in. Hang on. What's nature to your will?

That postseason ended with an infamous crack in the Wintrust door, but I remember it as Taurasi's last mythic stretch of basketball. She finished the second game of the Vegas series with a true shooting percentage over 100, which figures; the numbers she trafficked in always seemed unreal. Year by year, Taurasi retreated from the basket, observing a strict drive-free, jumper-only diet. This kept her alive but at the game's edges for the last part of her career so that when she did take over, it felt like a mean surprise.

Some all-time performances start hot and cool to a simmer, but not this one. On a bum ankle, Taurasi peels off a screen and fires, all innocent. Then she flings from the corner, wobbling mid-air. By the end, she's turned down a pristine strip of baseline to take a total laugher instead. What can she get away with? Everything.

As Taurasi walked off the floor of her final game, a playoff loss to the Lynx last September, the last players to hug her were Courtney Williams, a rival in quotability, and dead-eyed sharpshooter Kayla McBride. Taurasi spans so much of the life of the WNBA, lives in so many of its players, that some people believe her to be the league's logo. The WNBA denied it, and I don't see it either: You can make out the logo lady's hips and knees.

But her career did stretch, like a wire, between pixelated past and glamorous present. When she won her first WNBA championship, I'd just turned nine. ESPN's presentation of the Finals was ""brought to you by AOL."" Her huge, billowing shorts still looked normal. There's a video of Taurasi touring the Mercury's new facility before a Team USA practice at All-Star Weekend this past August. She plays pretend, the hostess at a housewarming, trying to seem at peace in all this newness. Jewell Loyd rounds a corner into the brightly lit frame. ""It's sick. You deserve it,"" Loyd says. Taurasi corrects her. ""No, we deserve it. We all deserve it.""

Bad timing, maybe. How sad to leave the house she built a smidge too late to live in. But the life Taurasi wanted for herself fell out of style anyway. She doesn't quite fit in a league run by multi-hyphenates tending to portfolios, trained to widen their scope beyond the court‚Äîto boardrooms, runways and magazines. She's a curious rock from outer space: Ahead of her time or behind it, she belongs to another world, not this one.

Nine years ago, Kate Fagan went to Yekaterinburg to write about Taurasi and Griner's offseason lives for ESPN The Magazine. The story opens at an Italian restaurant on the third floor of a Russian shopping mall. Taurasi hams it up with the waitress, who isn't having any of it. ""She's like, 'You might get put in jail,'"" Taurasi says to Griner's laughter‚Äîa grimly prescient joke. Basketball encases them in Russia. They hide in it. They can't imagine purer luxury than this, being walled off from all other obligations:

Taurasi, grinning, says, ""I mean, it's what we do, BG. This is what we do. Some people are like""‚Äîshe shifts her voice into a Valley Girl accent‚Äî""'I don't want to just be a basketball player.'""

The food comes and she picks up her fork. ""Well, guess what: I just want to be a basketball player.""

In the piece, Taurasi acts like a mentor to Griner, who's escaping a 2015 not unlike Dee's 2009‚Äîan arrest after a bad fight with her fianc√©e, a seven-game suspension, and a disastrous marriage quickly annulled. But Taurasi bristles at the label, at its whiff of announcement. She's just living a life, and if you happen to find it instructive, if you want to slick distraction behind your ears too, if you are sometimes so overcome by certainty in yourself, and so hurt when the certainty is misplaced that you want to punch something orange, fuck up a door, well, that's up to you.

""We have Diana, and they don't,"" the quote went. But who ever had Diana? It is the magic thing about her, the way she gave herself over to no one.

Two weekends ago, I was in Storrs for the first time. The fans brought sweet signs for Senior Day. Beneath those rafters choked with history, Gampel Pavilion filled up. I took a photo of the Swin Cash and Rip Hamilton banners beside each other and texted it to my parents, like some tourist in the museum of my girlhood. When the game ended‚Äîa quick drubbing of Marquette‚Äîthey played a montage set to that weepy The Head and the Heart song that lets you know something sad is happening. Their senior class is an odd one, unlucky with injuries, wounded again every March. Azzi Fudd might come back for another season‚Äîshe's not sure. ""Thank you for an amazing four, five, six years,"" Paige Bueckers deadpanned to the crowd, which laughed. ""We're not done yet, we got two more home games, so we're gonna need you back."" The other seniors whispered to themselves behind her.

They were solemn and restless, still stuck in the chase Taurasi made look so easy. Still hopeful that these four, five, six years of their lives will turn up somewhere in the Gampel ceiling. Taurasi thought this the highest honor: not transcending her sport, but being subsumed by it. Winning means never having to explain yourself; you just look up to the roof and point.

It's tradition that the fans stand and clap until the Huskies score their first basket. Most days, this doesn't take the players long, but for a few ear-splitting seconds, they live in the game's crucible. The noise carves itself away. All that's left is ball and basket. They're the moments Taurasi relished, when the world asked only one thing of her, and it was the same thing she wanted.

But I am able to get Econ victory under 45 turns consistently including my first ever game. It is my favorite victory type and 2/3 games I go for it. Once my setup is done I get 40-50 points per turn towards the legacy path. So here is how I do it.

Keys to win Econ are:

1. Factory resources - you need to have 1 resource with 7 copies for capital, 2 resource with 6 copies for cities. then a couple of more resources with at least 4 copies.

You need to plan for these resources in Exploration age. In my experience they are available in this order of abundance: Fish (Most), Cocoa/Kaolin/Cotton (tier 2), Coffee/Citrus/Tea (tier 3), Quinine (least).  
So either explore and settle them first. Disperse independent powers on your way early to ensure you have at least 70%/80% of required resource copies at the start of the Modern age.  
  
2. Gold - Building railroads and factories will take forever. Buying them is the best way to get a head start on other players! Econ victory conditions are unlocked earliest in the tech tree. Push that advantage. Also you don't really need more than 3 cities for this victory. Factory towns are just as good if not better.

3. Peace - Like all other non-military victory types. Peace is key to win this early and quickly.  
An enemy shutting down your factory or railroad building can deal a huge blow! Also you will need at least 3-4 key trade route to get the remaining 20%/30% of the factory resources.

So I like to reconcile with as many players as I can before starting the modern age. I also build our at least 2 fleets navy commanders and 3/4 fully stacked army commanders by the end of exploration to ensure AI doesn't start an early war on me in modern. Having more military at the start is very helpful.

If you have all of the above in your modern age then getting to Econ victory is just a few simple steps. Our goal is to have 2/3 cities with railroad, ports and factories and 2/3 towns with railroad and factories as soon as possible.

Follow this:  
\- Research railway first and then move towards mass production for factories.  
\- Build the first rail station in the capital. Don't build others first and no need to buy this one.

\- Then build / buy rail station in the nearest city and expand outwards one station at a time. Make sure to check if the tracks are actually connected. if not buy a merchant to connect with the capital.  
\- Build ports once you reach edge of the continent. I build ports on all of my cities as they help increase the resource capacity.  
\- This is also good time to start building the trade routes to get the missing resource copies.

\- once the factory is available its go time. you should have 8k/9k gold by then and at 600+ gold income.  
\- Now follow the same path as building railroads to start buying factories. If once of your cities or towns can't buy a factory, it means it is not connected to the tread network. So you need to buy a merchant and connect it with the nearest rail station.  
\- this is also the time to start specializing towns to ""factory towns"" to get the bonus resource slots and discount on buying the factory.

\- As you buy/build out all the factories in 8-10 turns you should already have enough resources to slot in them. Remember that one factory can only use one resource. Typically this is turn 30/35 for me. With all slots in a factory town/city taken up by factory resources exclusively.

Now sit back and relax. Reject any denouncements and stay away from the war by starting endeavors with your enemies. You should have the victory in then next 10-12 turns at max.

1jae614,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jae614/should_i_cut_my_cousin_off/,Should i cut my cousin off,"I've been dealing with a lot of shit these past few years but the one recurring issue is my family. I want to make a post about them too but for now my issue involves my cousin. Which we will call Lucy for idk. Privacy stuff. Anyway. Heres a lot to unpack so some back story. 
For years and years my cousin and i would be great friends everything would go great. If everything went her way. Im (f25) she is (f20)
And ever since we were kids she got everything her little heart wanted. I was and still em happy for her when she gets something really pricey or rare or whatever. Yet when i get something she makes a big deal of it. With everything she's in competition. It's exhausting af. Around 5 years ago its been getting hella worse. My mother passed away of cancer back then. Its as if my world crashed. I had to take care of mom since i was 11 when her cancer first showed up. And raise my little brother. I was grappling her my brother and School for years giving up school in the end to take care of her. She wasn't easy. Depression and cancer and mom was heavy on ""child discipline"" (nice word for child abuse). Nice. My cousin had her own traumas as well and yes in those times i didn't share. I didn't dump it on her or anyone else i stayed quiet had to, if i wasn't the rock my family needed they'd call me dramatic or over emotional. So i stopped sharing, everyone had their own issues they didn't need mine. Yet i had to play therapist for mom. Aunt. Cousins and who the fuck needed it. Yeah im a little bitter about it but sure. 
So the week after moms death my aunt drags me to her house to visit. It was like a blure, everything. Im aware i wasn't there for a majority of it i mean i wasn't even sure if mom was really dead i was just. There.
One morning We were supposed to wake up at 6 help her mom clean the kitchen and then we got paid a R100 for all the work. At 6 i was up and in the kitchen. I cleaned every little thing in there washed dishes. Cleaned the table everything. And she? She threw a tantrum and slept till 9 as i was doing everything including her work. She gets up and walks into the kitchen bitching because the sink is full if water or some shit. i literally had to wash the cheese greater a few forks and such and one plate. I was taking a break because my hands were sore from all the warm water. I ask her and i remember this.
""Oh could you please wash the last plate and bring it so i can dry it please"" she went off on me saying she can't wash the dishes and it's hard for her and her life is so hard. her friend was mean with her at school and she has it hard i get everything i want and has never lost anything in my life before... A week after moms death. My life was so easy so fun and carefree was her words
I started at her and snapped back called her a fucking bitch and walked away. Her mom took her to the other room and scolded her for saying that to me. Best part she still got paid afterwards. 

2 years later my body decides to take a heavy blast. I start getting these weird chest pains and short of breath sessions. I burst out in tears full blown anxiety attacks. Then the stomach pains came. They were hell. I realized something was wrong when there was blood in my vomit and stools. After 3 doctors i get diagnosed with gluten Intolerance. Depression and crippling anxiety. Great. And guess whaaaatt? My cousin gets Depression too. Whaat? Now im not saying we couldn't get it both at the same time. Life can be a bitch. Yet when my family asked me what's wrong with me she'd make it about herself. When i told them i have Depression, anxiety and gluten. She suddenly had lactose. And depression and would bring it up constantly. I don't bring up my depression alot because idk feels personal? But when i do she would jump in with stuff like ""i have depression too you know. Life is hard for me too. School is stressful. Depression has been getting me down and i got diagnosed with it before you""
Like i didn't know we were in a weird competition of who's life sucks more?. So i stopped bringing up my mental issues. 
Well today we are her now. Last night lucy was throwing one of her many tantrums. 
The thing came. I have been recently opened  up about a sa that has happened with me in the family. I made a post about it a week ago but deleted it to get it off my chest. I came to visit my aunt and her to basically get off the farm where i live and the guy that sa me lives as well. Everything was okay in the first 2 weeks. I wasn't gonna stay longer yet plans changed and money was tight so i end up staying for 2 more weeks. 
2 days ago im in the living room when i feel one of those heavy idk anxiety or panic attacks are happening. I have been feeling it for days and tried to hide it but it caught me. I collapsed to the floor crying i don't usually remember the details in these episodes i just know im shaking and it feels like im suffocating and dying. After the incident i felt like shit. Im aware it's not something i can help for but i feel ashamed when i fall apart like  that infront of my family. My aunt who is a nurse helped me through it. Afterwards she ask lucy to make some coffee. She's immediately pissed. She wants to go to bed early and we are bothering her. In the beginning of the visit she would stay up doing god knows what. Listening to reddit stories to fall asleep until 6 in the morning i couldn't sleep yet stayed quiet because she has collage and needs sleep. If it wasn't that she would call her fwb for hours long and talk. When i wanted to call my boyfriend she said it was fine she doesn't mind. I of course stood up and went to another room so she could still sleep. I didn't stay up late and play games because again she needed her sleep and so did my aunt. At times i would read or watch movies with my bf over discord with earphones on. I made exstra sure not to wake them.

But last night she snapped and threw her fit. Again. Her mom asks her to make coffee again, its around 8 at night and shes ""trying to sleep"" yet she's on her phone with the fwb. my cousin bitch and moans that she just wants to sleep early and no one would let her. I think hey ima not gonna sleep until 12 so why don't i do it? I get up and say ""no worries imma make tea"" she can sleep. That was apparently not right. Huh? She goes off saying ""i have to make her coffee in an hour again"". I say ""oh I'll still be awake i can make then too!"" I was positive for nothing She again snaps at me thats also wrong. ?!? Okay. I roll my eyes because by now. Idgaf. As i am walking she is bitching. Saying if i play fortnite she won't be able to sleep. I tell her don't know if i will be able to. My brother is still updating. Its a bit of a big one. So don't think we are gonna play tonight. And guess what?.  If you guessed i was wrong. Thats right! Good job citizen!. So she bitches again. I just walk off Making the tea and coffee. Then she goes into the kitchen saying. Don't worry. Imma sleep in the spare room so i can sleep early and not bother you
... okay? Do as you please?
Not even an hour she goes off on her mom saying i stay up and talk with my boyfriend loudly and she can't sleep. 
Girl?! I literally leave your room and go to the kitchen to not make noise. She kicks her feet and slams the door a few times because im loud. I swear to God. I wasn't even talking. I was literally on my phone with earphones watching yt. I really don't even know what she's on about. I sit up watching her storm in grab her pillows and tell me im so loud. She storms of again slamming the door. Im just staring at the door by now thinking wow. Communication would have been nice no?. Now i woke. i packed my things and im leaving tomorrow. For years she would treat me like this. We had a big fight in 2022 because she would bitch me over little things. Like she visits me. We are all playing games in the living room when me and my brother are talking she tells me to shut up because she's calling her boyfriend back then. My brother keeps talking and she doesn't tell him to shut up. But i get told to ""shut up"" she's fucking messy. Throwing her dirty panties everywhere and not cleaning up after herself. I had to clean then and now after her and if i don't i get bitched or snapped on. Like excuse me? When i pointed it out in 2022 that she's being a real bitch she threw a tantrum and started to hit the wall. I asked her to help me make the bed. I didn't shout or demand i literally asked. ""Lucy please pull that side of the blanket a little up. I can't reach it"" she was on the phone with her then bf. And started bitching me because she's busy and i could have done this myself. Omg i have so much shit about her that i can write about but this is already way too long. 

She gets a bf treats me like shit and then they leave her and they all say the same thing. ""She's extremely controlling"" all 5 her exs say the same thing. She tells me im the only female friend she has because the others are so mean to her. And she is one of the boys because she only has guy friends. Then we get into fights because i would get annoyed with her treating me like that and she would break stuff and throw tantrums and guess who apologizes? Me?! Always me?! My family telling me. Im the adult i have to apologize. She's 20!!! Idk. Is she's worth the friendship  because she's ""family"" im considering cutting her off because damn im exhausted.

The long hours, repetitive tasks, and constant movement took a toll on my body in ways I hadn‚Äôt expected. The first few weeks were the hardest‚ÄîI‚Äôd come home sore, barely able to move, and questioning whether I had made the right decision. But over time, I found ways to not just survive but actually get stronger, both physically and mentally.

The biggest lesson I learned was the importance of taking care of my body. At first, I thought I could just push through the pain, but that only made things worse. Stretching before and after work became my daily ritual, and I made sure to stay hydrated throughout the day. Korean meals, packed with rice, vegetables, and protein, helped me recover faster than I expected. I even started to enjoy the occasional bowl of *ÏÇºÍ≥ÑÌÉï* (ginseng chicken soup) on particularly exhausting days‚Äîit felt like a secret weapon against fatigue.

I also realized that energy management was just as important as physical endurance. During breaks, I took a few deep breaths, stretched my arms and legs, and made sure to eat small snacks to keep me going. A banana, a protein bar, or even a quick convenience store coffee became my best friends. Instead of burning myself out in the first half of the shift, I learned to pace myself and work efficiently rather than just quickly. Watching experienced coworkers helped‚ÄîI picked up little tricks that made my work easier, like adjusting my stance to reduce back strain or using better lifting techniques.

What really made a difference, though, was the people around me. At first, I felt like an outsider, struggling with the language and trying to keep up with the fast-paced work environment. But my coworkers quickly became my support system. We shared snacks, laughed at silly mistakes, and helped each other out whenever someone was struggling. Those small moments of kindness turned even the toughest shifts into something bearable, and eventually, even enjoyable.

There were definitely days when I felt like quitting, but I reminded myself why I came to Korea in the first place. I gave myself time to adjust, and slowly, my body got stronger. The work that once felt impossible became second nature. Looking back now, I realize that those challenging days helped me grow in ways I never expected.

If you‚Äôve ever worked a physically demanding job‚Äîwhether in Korea or anywhere else‚Äîyou probably know what I mean. What helped you push through the tough days? Do you have any tips or stories to share? I‚Äôd love to hear how others have managed to survive (and maybe even enjoy) hard work like this!

And let me tell you, it was so worth it.



I used to think spending money on coffee gear was ridiculous. I always made do with cheap drip coffee, convinced that fancy espresso setups were only for serious coffee snobs. But after using this thing for a few weeks, I totally get it now. The coffee is miles better, and the whole process of making it has become my favorite morning ritual. I actually enjoy waking up now.

Then March hits, I switch to Whatsapp, since I had my exams and wasn't using Hinge as much. We were having great conversations across subjects, everything going fine. So then one fine day he asks me to go for a basketball match. I agreed. He was kind enough to ""What time should I pick you up?"" and ""What flowers do you like?"" 

March 5, Wednesday: Date happens. He picks me up, we talk in the car about stuff, all going well. We hit the court, he teaches me how to play, all going sweet and well. He didn't try to exceed the boundaries or touch unnecessarily. His friends on the court kinda also gave him the ""look"" to appreciate him that haha bro has a girl. I go back home with the flower, he drops me. Even when I should be the one texting and thanking, but he hits me up with ""great time w you"" line WHILE STILL BEING IN THE TRAFFIC RETURNING HOME.
We speak about the date in the night, he asks me to go for coffee the next day. But due to some work, I refuse kindly.

Then we agree to meet on Monday, 10th.
Friday, Saturday everything goes well.
There's also a slight twist, that he began sexual advancements on chat, which came off as a surprise. To that, I made him choose that if he wants something real with me, he can't have all this at an early stage. Or if he wants casual, we keep no commitments. He agrees to the latter.

Sunday hits, I was slightly disappointed with his choice, so reply late, that I had gone for some screening with friends. He also replies late. 

Monday, as the plan comes closer, I call him twice and text in the evening that I'm in his area and if he wants to hangout. He texts back late that his mom is in the city (he lives alone) so he's been busy.
Ever since then his energy is off. He doesn't reply with seconds, doesn't text first, isn't using the same emojis or gifs in the convo.

Tuesday, I text him late at night asking if something is wrong, to which he refuses that we're good.

Wednesday also I text first asking what's up, just the usual. Thats when he stops replying at 11. I got suspicious so went on truecaller to check when did he last check his phone, to my surprise, he was on call at 1am.
He replies this morning, Thursday, saying he slept early!!!!!!!!

Now I don't know what's up, and its borderline crazy. Bro went from hugging me twice and saying I really wanna see you again, bringing me flowers, texting every second, calling me ""his girl"", and what not, to lying. I wonder if he also lied about his mom in the city, and that being his age.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I‚Äôm talking rings on every finger, layered necklaces, bracelets that make my coffee-holding selfies elite‚Äîthe whole thing. And the best part? I built my dream collection without going broke because I shop at Radiant Gems Co. (affordable, cute, 10/10 no regrets).

Enter my coworker, Sarah (30F).

Sarah is one of those people who acts nice but always has something shady to say. A few weeks ago, she started making comments like:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWow, how do you afford so much jewelry on our salary?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even wear all of it at once, do you really need that many rings?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou should give me one, you have so many!‚Äù (??? Excuse me?)

At first, I laughed it off, but then‚Äîthis woman dead serious goes, ‚ÄúYou should share! You don‚Äôt need all of that.‚Äù

I was stunned. Like, girl‚Ä¶ this isn‚Äôt kindergarten snack time. You don‚Äôt just take people‚Äôs stuff because they have ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù

So I told her, ‚ÄúI actually got all of this for super cheap at Radiant Gems Co. If you want jewelry, you can just buy some.‚Äù

She rolled her eyes and said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the point. You should just be nice.‚Äù

Now, she‚Äôs been super cold to me at work, and a mutual friend said I was being ‚Äústingy‚Äù because I have so much jewelry. But like?? It‚Äôs mine?? I worked for it. I found good deals. Just because I have a lot doesn‚Äôt mean I owe anyone my stuff.

1jadteo,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1jadteo/day_1_overview_and_plan/,Day 1 - Overview and Plan,"I was using about 6x 6mg a day for 8 months.

Here is what my timeline looked like and what I plan to do:

March 2023 - Tried 3mg. Got sick. Did this a few times when I had some time to burn. Walked away from it because of the headaches.

March 2024 - I was under a lot of stress and would take one at night when walking the dog. It was like a wind-down where I got to step outside of the stress for 30 minutes. I could barely keep one in my lip though and would end up with a headache.

May/June 2024 - I am now putting one in my lip after lunch and one in my lip at night when walking the dog. These would make me feel so sluggish during the day so I don't know why I kept doing it. The evening one was to pick me back up.

August 2024 - I am putting one in my lip after my morning coffee and basically using as many as I want throughout the day. My focus and productivity have never been so high but I crash in the evenings and feel so sluggish. I start getting a mild cough but continue using.

September 2024 to March 2025 - I look forward to going to sleep just to get to that morning pouch after my coffee. I find myself getting out of bed and working on personal projects and spending my time in a much more focused and driven way. I have never been as motivated in my life and I have never had this kind of discipline.But my cardio health is waning. I find myself out of breath just warming up at the gym. I realize something is off.

So today I haven't had one and I feel fine. It's been 3ish hours. I had my caffeine and I feel alert and focused. I believe if I can withstand this morning work without a pouch I can easily power through the afternoon.  
I bought a case of LaCroix and plan to use these as the small dopamine hits. I used to grab a pouch and toss it in and feel rejuvinated when trying to buckle down and get some work done. In the past I have used the carbonated water as dopamine treats to get through other challenges prior to using Zyn.

I The plan is to kick it and build my cardio fitness back up and then I can decide if it's something I want to use a utility in the future. It would be awesome to do 1 pouch randomly once a month while working on something very challenging.

Thanks for reading. Good luck everyone.

  
Edit: I have tapered the past few days before cold-turkey today and I noticed something interesting: My thoughts are coming back. I felt like the past year I was not very present. I was always dealing with a rambling voice in my head. The past few days while tapering I have been sitting still and simply observing what's going on around me. I have been laying down in bed randomly and just thinking about things. It feels like a very positive experience. I've been excited to simply observe thoughts and ""slow down"". 

I have been irritable but it tends to swing really hard. I go from being euphoric about tapering and getting healthy again to very down but aware that it's not really how I feel.

I'm curious if anyone else has experience this feeling of ""slowing down"" and regaining their inner narrative.",2,1741877630.0,QuittingZyn,5,1.0,False

But looking back, the friendships I made while working here became the best part of my experience.

At first, it wasn‚Äôt easy. The language barrier made simple conversations feel like puzzles, and I worried about fitting in. But I quickly realized that friendship doesn‚Äôt always need perfect words. A shared laugh over a work mistake, a coworker offering me a snack during break time, or the simple act of helping each other finish a task‚Äîthese small moments built trust faster than I expected.

One of my closest friends in Korea was a coworker who barely spoke English, and my Korean was just as bad. Yet, through gestures, broken sentences, and a lot of Google Translate, we found a way to communicate. We bonded over music, food, and the shared experience of adapting to the fast-paced work environment. Eventually, our after-work meals and weekend trips became the highlights of my time here.

What surprised me the most was how welcoming people were. Even when I felt like an outsider, my Korean colleagues made sure I never ate alone, helped me with everyday things like paying bills, and even invited me to their family gatherings.

If you‚Äôre planning to work in Korea, know this‚Äîyes, work can be challenging, and yes, cultural differences exist. But if you open yourself up, you'll find friendships that make every tough day worth it. The people you meet will not only make Korea feel like home but will also leave a lasting impact on your life.

So be brave, smile first, and take that coffee break with your coworkers‚Äîyou never know, it might be the start of a lifelong friendship. You've got this!",1,1741877613.0,WorkLifeInKorea,0,1.0,False
1jads23,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1jads23/i_cannot_deal_with_the_micro_aggression_and/,I cannot deal with the micro aggression and pettiness my roommate shows towards me anymore,"I moved into a new apartment last year and initially me and my roommate got along very well. That was until she decided to adopt a cat. I have been a cat parent before and so I was very enthusiastic about it, but since the day she got the cat home I always respected her boundaries. She would insist on doing everything for the cat, even if i suggested her not to. Like when we first got the cat home she immediately started feeding the cat new food, and when i told her the cat needs to be eased in, she said her boyfriend thinks it's okay because he has cats too. The next day the cat got sick and started shitting a lot, and yet she did not admit i was right and just started feeding the cat as per my instructions.   
She started showing me signs of micro agression which i kept ignoring to not stir any drama. But one day, just before a major exam of mine she yelled at me and called me childish for trying to play with her cat. She accused me of trying to steal her cat which was crazy because i've been nothing but distant with her cat. I was honestly broken and in disbelief when she spoke to me that way, so i told her it's best we stay cordially as roommates and not as friends to avoid any boundaries being crossed. She apologised and blamed it on her abandonment issue as the middle child. She said she believes the cat will like me more which i find weird because i dont interact with the cat at all, and it kills me.

It's been 4 months now and things are okay I would say. We avoid each other as much as possible and only converse if there is anything home related to discuss. She borrows my things all the time, the other day it was some pasta sauce i got, day before it was my lint roller, and i've never ever stopped her because whats the big deal.

A few grocery runs ago she got a coffee powder, that was taking up space in our pantry but it went unused. I asked her about it and she said she has stopped drinking coffee now. So when my coffee powder ran out, i took a spoon of coffee from it. She wasnt home and i fully planned on telling her but it slipped my mind. This morning i opened the cabinet again only to realize that i forgot to buy my coffee powder which is a mistake i agree, and made a mental note to myself to bring some new coffee powder. And that's when i realized, my roommate hid her full jar off coffee powder (I had taken one spoon before) AND NOW I AM MAD. Like whats the big deal? Just ask me if i took it and i would happily buy you some new one. But hiding it so i dont take any more is a bit passive aggressive and so unnecessary. 

  
This is really bothering me because this girl makes me feel like a shitty person just for existing and literally being a human being. Should i confront her or let it go? Confronting her is scary because she never takes criticism well ",1,1741877529.0,badroommates,2,0.57,False

I really wonder how people do it.¬†

Some background, I suppose. I'm currently on medical leave from my university. An externally-affiliated psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression and sent me back home so that I can seek help from a local therapist and psychiatrist. Throughout this entire process, my dad strongly believes that I'm not a depressed or ""mentally sick"" person, but I just lacked conviction.  
  
He sat me down and said, ""So, what're your goals?"" Hesitantly, I told him I want to return to university next semester. He nods, then tells me that if that's truly my goal, the pace at which I'm going is snail-pace slow. (I don't disagree. I've been struggling to do pretty much anything. Eating, drinking, sleeping well, let alone do all the stuff like apply for jobs and revise for classes before the medical leave ends.) He continues, saying that if this is truly my goal, I have to work a lot harder so I won't be left behind and struggle with all the workload and pressure of studying abroad.¬†

I know this is to be true. I felt it during my first year before I broke down mentally from all the external pressures that surrounded the entire experience. The break-neck pace with which people went with their studies and networking was so fast I felt like the world was a blur to me. At the time, it's almost like I can blink and everyone was moving on to the next event, the next item on their to-do list. Within the first two months I felt burned out. It didn't help that within that brutal hellscape, most interactions felt superficial since I could just *feel* in my heart how people are secretly making a mental note of whether someone is worth being friends with based on one's ability and ambition. It's scary how, just at the mere thought of this, I can feel the phantom pressure weighing down on me.

*If that's the case, then why don't I just not go to such a competitive university? I could've just told my dad that my goal is not to go back.*¬†

I wish. Even if no one around me says it, I can tell that they'll be disappointed in me. *What a shame for someone like you to give up on going to a good university. I guess you were too weak, unable to handle the pressure.* Stubbornly, I also wish for my own sake I'm able to see this through so I won't ever regret it in the future. A future in which I won't get a job because I wasn't competitive enough.

With that context in mind, I listened on as my dad told me his suggestions on what I should do in order to enrich myself in preparation for the next lesson. As he went on, I realized that I wasn't looking at him, I was looking at the ground, and my back slouched forward as though it was carrying a ton of bricks.¬†

When I came to, my dad was telling me how I need to be able to adapt. I need to be able to make the comeback from my current state. As tired as I feel, it's the world, cruel and brutal as it is. And I'm barely having a taste of how excruciating it is to live. I know he didn't bother to mince his words because, as he stated prior to this conversation, he wanted me to have a full taste of the real world. The entire conversation ended with a ""Think on it, UltiDeduction,"" and I'm left processing what he just told me.¬†

I know what he's telling me is the truth. I know that, but I feel nothing but dread at everything in the future. Everyone around me are like maniacs, chugging down coffee religiously but out there becoming club presidents, organizing events for the student committee, doing all kinds of internships (some said to me in private they did 3-4 internships before going into university.) I can't help but think I'm beside a bunch of demihumans with how they're able to manage socializing, studies, clubs, etc. I don't know how many times I thought to myself, I wish I can be stronger and withstand the pressure, but here I am depressed and unable to get out of this bed. Gosh, I wish I can just get out from this pit, so I am no one's burden. So I'm able to stand proudly beside my peers and not have the urge to shirk away every time someone asks me how I'm doing.¬†

I wish. I wish. Then despair/apathy swallows me whole.",1,1741877239.0,depression,0,0.99,False

1jadmm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeoptimize/comments/1jadmm3/the_5_stages_of_buyer_awareness_and_what_they/,"The 5 Stages of Buyer Awareness, And What They Mean For Your Writing","Whether you realize it or not, you go through a journey every time you make a purchase.

Before you buy something new, you spend time learning and thinking about it. You never see something that you‚Äôre totally unfamiliar with and buy it right then and there.

The journey looks very different depending on the thing you‚Äôre buying.

When you‚Äôre buying a cup of coffee from your favorite cafe, the journey is very short. You already know what the product is. So, the journey is two steps:

1. I want a flat white from Sloth‚Äôs Cafe.
2. I‚Äôm going to buy one.

But, if I offered you an etihwtalf, the buyer‚Äôs journey looks much different. You have no idea what that is, how much it costs, what it does, or what problem it solves.

You have no idea if you want an etihwtalf, so the buying process starts with you learning about it, becoming aware of what it can do for you, and why it‚Äôs the best option.

Everyone is in a different stage of the buyer‚Äôs journey.

In his famous book, Breakthrough Advertising, Eugene Schwartz explains the 5 different stages of awareness.

If you‚Äôre writing copy, you need to understand what stage of awareness your reader is at. If you have no idea what my product is, my writing needs to be completely different than if you‚Äôve already experienced my product and I want you to buy it again.

Here are the 5 stages of awareness, and tips to write copy for each stage.

# Unaware

At this stage, your reader is unaware of their problem and the solution you‚Äôre offering. This means the reader has never heard of the product or service, or any of the competitors.

They might be experiencing some symptoms of the problem, but haven‚Äôt identified it yet.

# What it means

When you‚Äôre writing to an unaware audience, you can only appeal to the identity of the person.

You need to cast a wide net, and do a lot of educating.

Because of that, most people don‚Äôt want to write to an unaware audience. It requires a lot more work to build trust with your readers, and help them understand why what you‚Äôre talking about is important to them.

# Problem Aware

Your reader is aware of their problem, but they‚Äôre unaware of any solutions to their problem. For example, your reader is having some back pain, but doesn‚Äôt know what they should do about it.

Maybe they need new shoes? Or a new desk chair? Or a back massager?

They have no idea right now, but they‚Äôre feeling the back pain.

# What it means

Show people that you understand their problem, and tell them that you have a solution.

You‚Äôll still need to do a lot of education in your copy. People at this stage will be unsure about the solution you‚Äôre offering, so you need to spend time building trust and relating to the reader.

# Solution Aware

This means your reader is aware of their problem, and they know some solutions exist. But they aren‚Äôt sure if¬†**your**¬†solution is right for them.

Imagine you‚Äôre walking around in a city you‚Äôve never been to. It‚Äôs lunchtime, you‚Äôre hungry, and you want a slice of pizza. The problem is that you‚Äôre hungry and want pizza.

You know that there are probably various restaurants that sell pizza, but you have no idea which one is best for you. You know the solution is somewhere, and need to find your ideal solution.

# What it means

You need to show the reader that you‚Äôre knowledgeable about the solutions, and prove why your solution is their best option.

Remember that people in this stage know about their problem, and that are solutions out there. They‚Äôre still a bit skeptical, so your copy needs to tell them specifically how your solution is going to solve their problem, and why it‚Äôs better than the other solutions.

Maybe your pizza shop has the best deal in town ‚Äî any slice and drink for $3. Or you have the widest variety of pizzas. Or you offer the fastest delivery in town.

Tell the reader exactly why you‚Äôre the best.

# Product Aware

At this stage, your reader is aware of your solution. They‚Äôve heard about your offer, but they‚Äôre not fully convinced that it‚Äôs right for them.

Maybe they heard one of your commercials, read an article about your product, or a friend recommended you to them. When people are at this stage, you might have an advantage over your competitors, but you need to get people to cross the line and become a customer.

People have objections and reasons why they‚Äôre not going to buy what you‚Äôre selling, and you need to overcome those.

# What it means

You need to communicate your best offer and promises. Prove to them why your solution is their best option and aim to eliminate any risks they might see.

# Most Aware

Your reader is right on the edge of buying your product, but hasn‚Äôt crossed the line yet. They know exactly what your product does, and they want to buy it.

This is the situation when you know you want to buy a new pair of Nike Air Zoom running shoes. But, something is holding you back from making the purchase.

Maybe you think the shoes are too expensive. Or you‚Äôre worried that they‚Äôre not going to last. Or couldn‚Äôt find the color and size you wanted at the store.

You know exactly what you want, but need an extra push to cross the line.

# What it means

You need to overcome the reader‚Äôs final objective.

To do that, you need to know what that objection is.

* Is your product too expensive?
* Are they worried that your product will take too long to get delivered?
* Are people unsure of the results your services will get them?
* Do they think there‚Äôs a lengthy onboarding process?

If you can figure out what someone‚Äôs final objective is, you can make them an offer that‚Äôs impossible to resist.

Before writing any copy, you need to understand what stage of awareness your reader is at. Writing to a problem aware audience is much different than writing to a product aware audience.

Whether you realize it or not, you go through a journey every time you make a purchase.

Before you buy something new, you spend time learning and thinking about it. You never see something that you‚Äôre totally unfamiliar with and buy it right then and there.

The journey looks very different depending on the thing you‚Äôre buying.

When you‚Äôre buying a cup of coffee from your favorite cafe, the journey is very short. You already know what the product is. So, the journey is two steps:

1. I want a flat white from Sloth‚Äôs Cafe.
2. I‚Äôm going to buy one.

But, if I offered you an etihwtalf, the buyer‚Äôs journey looks much different. You have no idea what that is, how much it costs, what it does, or what problem it solves.

You have no idea if you want an etihwtalf, so the buying process starts with you learning about it, becoming aware of what it can do for you, and why it‚Äôs the best option.

Everyone is in a different stage of the buyer‚Äôs journey.

In his famous book, Breakthrough Advertising, Eugene Schwartz explains the 5 different stages of awareness.

If you‚Äôre writing copy, you need to understand what stage of awareness your reader is at. If you have no idea what my product is, my writing needs to be completely different than if you‚Äôve already experienced my product and I want you to buy it again.

Here are the 5 stages of awareness, and tips to write copy for each stage.

# Unaware

At this stage, your reader is unaware of their problem and the solution you‚Äôre offering. This means the reader has never heard of the product or service, or any of the competitors.

They might be experiencing some symptoms of the problem, but haven‚Äôt identified it yet.

# What it means

When you‚Äôre writing to an unaware audience, you can only appeal to the identity of the person.

You need to cast a wide net, and do a lot of educating.

Because of that, most people don‚Äôt want to write to an unaware audience. It requires a lot more work to build trust with your readers, and help them understand why what you‚Äôre talking about is important to them.

# Problem Aware

Your reader is aware of their problem, but they‚Äôre unaware of any solutions to their problem. For example, your reader is having some back pain, but doesn‚Äôt know what they should do about it.

Maybe they need new shoes? Or a new desk chair? Or a back massager?

They have no idea right now, but they‚Äôre feeling the back pain.

# What it means

Show people that you understand their problem, and tell them that you have a solution.

You‚Äôll still need to do a lot of education in your copy. People at this stage will be unsure about the solution you‚Äôre offering, so you need to spend time building trust and relating to the reader.

# Solution Aware

This means your reader is aware of their problem, and they know some solutions exist. But they aren‚Äôt sure if¬†**your**¬†solution is right for them.

Imagine you‚Äôre walking around in a city you‚Äôve never been to. It‚Äôs lunchtime, you‚Äôre hungry, and you want a slice of pizza. The problem is that you‚Äôre hungry and want pizza.

You know that there are probably various restaurants that sell pizza, but you have no idea which one is best for you. You know the solution is somewhere, and need to find your ideal solution.

# What it means

You need to show the reader that you‚Äôre knowledgeable about the solutions, and prove why your solution is their best option.

Remember that people in this stage know about their problem, and that are solutions out there. They‚Äôre still a bit skeptical, so your copy needs to tell them specifically how your solution is going to solve their problem, and why it‚Äôs better than the other solutions.

Maybe your pizza shop has the best deal in town ‚Äî any slice and drink for $3. Or you have the widest variety of pizzas. Or you offer the fastest delivery in town.

Tell the reader exactly why you‚Äôre the best.

# Product Aware

At this stage, your reader is aware of your solution. They‚Äôve heard about your offer, but they‚Äôre not fully convinced that it‚Äôs right for them.

Maybe they heard one of your commercials, read an article about your product, or a friend recommended you to them. When people are at this stage, you might have an advantage over your competitors, but you need to get people to cross the line and become a customer.

People have objections and reasons why they‚Äôre not going to buy what you‚Äôre selling, and you need to overcome those.

# What it means

You need to communicate your best offer and promises. Prove to them why your solution is their best option and aim to eliminate any risks they might see.

# Most Aware

Your reader is right on the edge of buying your product, but hasn‚Äôt crossed the line yet. They know exactly what your product does, and they want to buy it.

This is the situation when you know you want to buy a new pair of Nike Air Zoom running shoes. But, something is holding you back from making the purchase.

Maybe you think the shoes are too expensive. Or you‚Äôre worried that they‚Äôre not going to last. Or couldn‚Äôt find the color and size you wanted at the store.

You know exactly what you want, but need an extra push to cross the line.

# What it means

You need to overcome the reader‚Äôs final objective.

To do that, you need to know what that objection is.

* Is your product too expensive?
* Are they worried that your product will take too long to get delivered?
* Are people unsure of the results your services will get them?
* Do they think there‚Äôs a lengthy onboarding process?

If you can figure out what someone‚Äôs final objective is, you can make them an offer that‚Äôs impossible to resist.

Before writing any copy, you need to understand what stage of awareness your reader is at. Writing to a problem aware audience is much different than writing to a product aware audience.

1jadmld,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1jadmld/is_getting_to_know_people_always_this_stressful/,is getting to know people always this stressful?,"so, I (22F) have gone without romantic attention for most of my life. the first time people actually showed interest was about two years ago and I was totally fine with it because I also never had many romantic feelings for anyone until that time, so it was perfect for my timeline.
now I fell in love once and the guy did like me back(didn't tell me but our mutual friend later did)but I think it took me too long to realise my feelings so he eventually moved on and since then I cannot seem to imagine anything serious with anyone.

I get my little crushes, sure, but I pull away immediately when I feel like things get serious because I just don't feel the same love as I did for that guy two years ago so it would not be fair for the other person if I wasn't fully in it.

I think I just need time and I need things to develop naturally and most people seem to not have that timeline and want to jump into things very early on. especially physically, I can't do anything unless I have a foundation of trust and a real connection.

now lately I've been going out, meeting people, not in a dating setting but really just going to social events to meet people. I try to be friendly as I do want to have friends (I moved cities so I do kinda need them) and then I meet people and they seem to show their interest in me early on, even voicing it straight up and I always end up turning them down.

literally yesterday I met a guy and we got along well, decided to drink a coffee and walk around today and before we said goodbye he confessed that he was interested in me. I am flattered, especially since this is probably the first time someone actually tried to get to know me before telling me, like we spent a lot of time just talking and getting to know each other and I really enjoyed it. I was a bit confused though, since earlier in our conversation we talked about how similar our way of thinking is and he advised me not to date someone like me but later he said something else.

I told him I am willing for us to get to know each other better and see if it takes us in a romantic direction or just a friendship and he said from the beginning that he does want to stay friends even if it doesn't work out, so I want to believe he really means it. and I think I do mean it, because it's really refreshing to have someone get to know me before confessing, usually it's just we hang out once, barely even talk about anything deep or personal and they tell me they like me like.. I don't know how you can jump there.

as of now I don't feel anything romantic for him but I did tell him I need time for that kind of stuff so he knows where I stand.

now I'm just afraid of it. every time I'm in a situation like this I pull away, maybe I'm scared of letting someone in after that one guy but I really don't know how to handle that. I just don't know how to deal with anything like that but I don't want to continue pushing people away immediately. this guy seems like a really good person but I'm scared I end up just pushing him away so he's not part of my life like I seem to always do, because I enjoy his company a lot, even if it's just in a platonic way..

I hate dating, I don't know how people do it. I don't know how I'm supposed to let someone into my heart. I feel like it's impossible for me",1,1741877128.0,dating,4,1.0,False

Rose Ski resort, the mountain, at a base elevation of 8,620 feet, stirs to life. Among the first to arrive are Olivia Lambdin and Ella Hollingshead, two lift operators who carpool together, arriving by 7:30 A.M. to prepare for their 8:00 to 4:30 shift.

‚ÄúMake coffee, get in the car, drive up. I carpool with Ella. Get dressed. We roll out as a little unit around eight,‚Äù explains Olivia, describing the start of her typical day. ‚ÄúGo to our assignments. We get a couple breaks and a lunch and a lot of shoveling, a lot of pick axing. I have never had muscles that I‚Äôve had, so yeah. It‚Äôs good.‚Äù

It‚Äôs been a busy season for local ski workers with repeated snowstorms.¬† With an eye on weather forecasts, many who rely on seasonal work throughout the year are currently also worried about what comes later this year. 

Plans are being upended as the Donald Trump administration and the DOGE advisory board reduce federal work opportunities, including seasonal ones.  

Like many ski resorts across the country, Mt. Rose operates largely on the labor of seasonal employees who piece together various jobs throughout the year to create a lifestyle that few outsiders fully understand. 

For Olivia and Ella, the day-to-day responsibilities revolve around safely moving skiers and snowboarders up the¬† mountain.¬†

‚ÄúThat means I move the people. Just make sure they get on the chair in one piece and then off in one piece,‚Äù Olivia said.

Ella, a more experienced lift operator, added her own perspective.¬†

‚ÄúWell, when I‚Äôm running a lift, I guess the number one priority is making sure people don‚Äôt die.‚Äù Ella said. ‚ÄúBut I like to focus on ramp work. I think it‚Äôs just because I have a lot of experience with trail work. It‚Äôs kind of similar because you‚Äôre just grading and leveling. I just like making it look nice.‚Äù

Their shifts are physically demanding, especially during heavy snow days, with shoveling and maintaining the loading areas becoming a constant task.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/zfrcbnt8ygoe1.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=b12ecf3195950fd9129e1ab37500eb21de9eaa63

‚ÄúA lot of people think it‚Äôs just kind of like a beginner job or whatever,‚Äù explained Justan Wood, who worked as a lift operator for two seasons before transitioning to a year-round position as a lift mechanic. ‚ÄúBut you are operating a huge machine and people‚Äôs lives are technically in your hands because it‚Äôs pretty dangerous. Lifts are moving at a high speed. They‚Äôre big giant steel machines.‚Äù

The culture among these workers forms a tight-knit community that becomes a significant part of the appeal. ‚ÄúThe people are usually the biggest reason why I would stay somewhere with a certain job,‚Äù Ella said.¬†

When the snow melts and the resort closes for the season, the real challenge begins for seasonal workers like Ella and Olivia. While Justan has secured year-round employment at Mt. Rose as a lift mechanic, most of the mountain workforce must find alternative employment during the warmer months.

‚ÄúFinding a job in the summer obviously is a huge one,‚Äù Justan said. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have a consistent job in the summer then it‚Äôs tough because you‚Äôre basically getting laid off every single year for five or six months.‚Äù

Ella‚Äôs employment history demonstrates the remarkable variety of jobs that seasonal workers string together. After starting at a summer camp in Texas, she‚Äôs worked as a trail crew member in Colorado, a housekeeper at a YMCA in the Rockies, a lift operator and convention setup worker at Sun Valley Resort in Idaho, a farm worker, a trail builder with Friends of Nevada Wilderness, and a whitewater rafting guide in California.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even really know it was a thing,‚Äù Ella said of seasonal work. ‚ÄúEven when I went out to my first seasonal job, I still didn‚Äôt really understand how some people did it all the time, like they just travel and travel and go to different jobs.‚Äù

The uncertainties between seasons create significant stress. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs usually pretty stressful and I already have some general anxiety so it can get really overwhelming,‚Äù Ella admitted. ‚ÄúBut then usually, I mean, every single time it works itself out.‚Äù

Some winter resort workers transition to summer employment with federal agencies such as the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, and Bureau of Land Management. These positions, particularly in wildland firefighting, trail maintenance, and visitor services, have provided reliable summer income for seasonal workers while allowing them to remain in outdoor-focused careers.

However, recent policy changes coming from Washington, D.C., are threatening this lifestyle.¬†

¬†‚ÄúStaffing cuts of this magnitude will have devastating consequences for parks and communities. We are concerned about smaller parks closing visitor center doors and larger parks losing key staff,‚Äù Theresa Pierno, the president and CEO for the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) warned.¬†

For Olivia, who holds a Bachelor‚Äôs in Environmental Science with an emphasis in Life Science, these reductions have altered her career trajectory.

‚ÄúAlmost all of my friends have been affected by it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBeing a part of a national park was the dream. Like that was the final goal. That was why I got the degree, why I have done the research that I‚Äôve done. It was to be given a plot of land in a national park or something and be a steward of it.‚Äù

Similarly, Ella, who has worked with the Forest Service through an AmeriCorps program and harbors aspirations of becoming a wildland firefighter, finds herself reconsidering her options.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little scary,‚Äù she said of the federal employment changes. ‚ÄúI know a ton of people that work with the BLM and National Parks and just tons of those federal organizations... and they directly know others who have been laid off or fired. I‚Äôm in school right now and I was going to, I always planned to go for forest ecology, but now I‚Äôm starting to rethink it.‚Äù

In the face of these new challenges, seasonal workers are developing various strategies to adapt.¬†

Ella maintains Mt. Rose as her winter backup plan but acknowledges the precariousness of even this option.

‚ÄúI've always assumed while I‚Äôm living in Reno‚Ä¶Mt. Rose is always my winter job if I can‚Äôt get something year-round with one of those federal agencies,‚Äù Ella said. ‚ÄúBut even that is like, they‚Äôre \[Mt. Rose\] on a permit by the Forest Service and so no one really knows how that could be affected.‚Äù

Olivia is now exploring opportunities with non-governmental organizations, while continuing to substitute teach one day a week during the winter season.

‚ÄúMy big fingers crossed one is through the Great Basin Institute where I would be doing restoration ecology in the Great Basin Desert,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúThese places still need protection and to be studied and if it means working on a smaller scale, then so be it, but the work is still there and the place needs protecting.‚Äù

For Olivia, a sense of determination remains.¬†

‚ÄúThe next few years are going to be a lot of trying to get through, and hopefully after this administration, there‚Äôs one that will restore the National Park budget,‚Äù Olivia said. ‚ÄúFor the next few years though, probably do seasonal work for a little while, might go back into academia.‚Äù

Academia itself feels endangered with the downscaling of federal funding.

Even though the future may look bleak, Olivia concluded with a note of resilience that characterizes many in the seasonal workforce: ‚ÄúIt just won‚Äôt happen in the way that it was envisioned to,‚Äù she concluded. ¬†

1jadj2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/s/QFcGfaqycg,A year update/advice & lessons learned.,"SW: 180 lbs, CW: 146lbs, GW: 120llbs 

Hi everyone,

My personal context: 

I‚Äôm writing this as an update from a year ago! A bit of background; I gained a lot of weight post COVID and hit my highest weight of 180 (I have never been a bigger person in my life grew up seriously skinny). Nothing had changed about my eating habits but once I turned 23 all the junk caught up with me and I couldn‚Äôt accommodate my sweet tooth if I wanted to fit into my jeans. 

I was also unfortunately told that I had excess fat in my liver and needed to loose weight to shed it/ was at risk of diabetes. 

All of this really scared me shitless so I immediately joined the IF sub and began IF. It was hard at first to be honest but I think my health concern rlly triggered my self control. I stayed strong for 2 months and I went down 10llbs to about 170. 

After this I unfortunately fell off the wagon, but not in the way you would think. It was clear people noticed I lost the 10llbs (fat blindness is real). I was so happy and proud of my results but because of mental health challenges and such I gave in to some sweet treats and stopped counting my calories and such. 

Regardless, luckily, although I was completely unfocused in being healthy 6 months post this time I had maintained that 10 llb weight loss. 

It was hard but the new year was starting and I was determined to continue going and I did, I started again at the beginning /end of December January and you guys in down to 146llbs in 3 months! 

I still have about 20llbs to go but I‚Äôm just so proud of myself because this was genuinely so hard and terrible, what‚Äôs pushing me through is trying to convince myself I only have to do this ONE time and then maintain for the rest of my life which I‚Äôm so ready for. 

It‚Äôs easier for me to workout, my skin has gotten better, I‚Äôm not as afraid to look into the mirror. 

My diet; 

IF has been extremely helpful for me as it has almost surpressed my appetite, because I‚Äôm fasting all the time, I‚Äôm experiencing hunger a lot but it‚Äôs almost become like a distant noise/something I‚Äôm used to, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like my old uncontrollable (sugar) hunger cravings. I know when I need a meal and when I need a snack or a glass of water. 

I have gone SUPER low carb (only 1 cup of rice or noodles a week if anything) I focused on complex carbs, fruits, vegetables and a hell of a lot of protein. 

This is more personal to me, I usually love meat but I‚Äôve been having trouble consuming enough to supplement the lack of calories from other places so honestly don‚Äôt be afraid of supplements, my protein powder has literally been my dark knight and gotten me through terrible cravings. I buy the sun warrior one because the ingredient list is clean and it provides other nutrients! 

I drink coffee everyday (always have) but as u know it‚Äôs also an appetite suppressant! 

I focus on large volume low cal - lots of my snacking is vegetables. Letting go of snacking was extremely hard for me, I literally lived by it. Now I didn‚Äôt have to completely let go, but I rlly had to cut myself off for a while to start because I knew how bad my habits were and the slippery slope. My advice here is to just buy what you like over and over again. You only like carrots or broccoli? That‚Äôs perfectly fine, but a shit ton and eat it till u can‚Äôt anymore.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a justification, but sometimes when you‚Äôre scraping by, you do things you wouldn‚Äôt normally do. It all started when I noticed some customers would just glance at the menu, pay without really looking at the total, and then leave with their drink, none the wiser.

One slow afternoon, I accidentally overcharged someone by a few bucks‚Äîjust a simple mistake, I thought. But when they didn‚Äôt say anything, I realized something. They didn‚Äôt care. They paid it, walked off, and didn‚Äôt blink an eye. That‚Äôs when the idea hit me. What if I could do this every time? A couple extra bucks here, a bit more there‚Äîit wouldn‚Äôt hurt, right?

At first, it was small‚Äîlike, $1 or $2 on each order. But then it escalated. The more customers I saw, the more I realized they never checked their receipts. So, I started adding an extra $5 to larger orders. People were barely paying attention, and honestly, the tip was still good, so I got away with it.

But here‚Äôs the thing. As much as I‚Äôve tried to justify it, I can‚Äôt help but feel terrible. I‚Äôve made way more money off this than I ever expected. It was supposed to be a harmless little hustle, but now every time someone orders, I wonder if I‚Äôm ripping them off too much. The guilt‚Äôs starting to eat at me. I feel like I‚Äôm living a lie.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Part of me wants to come clean, but another part just wants to keep cashing in while I can. Am I the worst person ever for¬†doing¬†this?‚Äù",2,1741876442.0,confessions,2,0.75,False

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve decided to challenge myself to go 30 days without caffeine. I really enjoy coffee ‚Äì the taste, the routine, and that boost it gives me in the morning. But lately, I‚Äôve started wondering if I‚Äôve become too dependent on it. I don‚Äôt want something like coffee to have so much influence over how I feel or act, so I‚Äôm taking a break to see what happens.

I‚Äôm curious to find out if cutting it out will make me feel better in the long run ‚Äì maybe improved energy, better sleep, or just feeling more balanced overall. I also know it‚Äôs not going to be easy, especially in the first few days, and I‚Äôm bracing myself for the withdrawal. I am currently at 2 Coffee a day max, mostly just one before anything Focus related.

For anyone who‚Äôs done this before:
	‚Ä¢	What changes did you notice after giving up 
coffee?
      ‚Ä¢      Anything very unexpected, seemingly unrelated, that changed?(something unexpected)
	‚Ä¢	What were the hardest parts of quitting, and how did you get through them?
	‚Ä¢	Any tips to make the process easier?

I‚Äôm excited to see how I feel at the end of this, but I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and experiences.

Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect myself, but the promise of new experiences pushed me forward.

Finding the job wasn't as complicated as I thought. I joined some online communities, checked job postings, and asked questions from people already in Korea. Soon enough, I was on a plane, nervous but excited, with just a suitcase and some shaky Korean phrases I'd learned from YouTube.

Arriving at my workplace, everything felt surreal. The machinery, the unfamiliar sounds, even the language barrier was overwhelming at first. But slowly, the strange became familiar, and the coworkers I once struggled to communicate with became friends who patiently taught me Korean phrases between coffee breaks.

Of course, not every day was easy. There were challenging shifts and moments when homesickness hit hard, but surprisingly, those were the days when my Korean colleagues showed the most warmth. Their small acts of kindness‚Äîsharing snacks, jokes, and smiles‚Äîreminded me why I came in the first place.

Today, looking back, I'm so grateful for taking that leap. My factory job in Korea taught me resilience, openness, and humility. It shaped me into someone stronger and more confident than I ever imagined.

So, if you're considering taking that leap, go for it. Korea isn‚Äôt just a place to work; it‚Äôs a place to grow, learn, and find yourself. Trust me, the journey is worth it, every step of the way. You've got this!",1,1741876349.0,WorkLifeInKorea,0,1.0,False

Creating a cozy and functional living space often starts with selecting the right furniture set indoor. An indoor furniture set can transform a room, enhancing both its aesthetic appeal and usability. Whether it's for a small apartment or a spacious house, choosing the correct pieces ensures your indoor space is well-utilized and inviting.

When selecting an indoor furniture set, consider various styles to match your home‚Äôs decor. From contemporary and minimalist to classic and rustic, there are endless options to personalize your space. A cohesive furniture set, featuring a sofa, chairs, coffee table, and possibly a dining set, will create a coordinated look that feels deliberate and stylish.

Another essential factor to ponder is functionality. Furniture sets designed for indoor use should offer both comfort and practicality. Look for sofas with versatile configurations, dining tables that can expand for guests, and chairs that serve dual purposes, such as those with built-in storage. These features allow you to maximize your indoor area, especially in smaller homes.

The quality of materials used in an indoor furniture set also significantly impacts durability. Opt for sets made from high-quality woods, metals, or durable fabrics that withstand everyday wear and tear while remaining easy to clean. Investing in a reputable furniture set indoor enhances your living environment and adds value to your home.

Lastly, don‚Äôt forget about the importance of color and texture. Choose colors that evoke the mood you want to achieve in your indoor space. Layering different textures with cushions, throws, and area rugs can also define the style and comfort of your area, making it feel warm and inviting.

Finding the perfect furniture set for indoors requires a balance of style, functionality, and quality. By carefully considering these factors, you can create a beautiful and practical indoor oasis that reflects your personality.

1jad9bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1jad9bh/lpt_fear_isnt_stopping_you_its_guiding_you/,"LPT: Fear isn't stopping you, it's guiding you","Hello r/LPT. I want to share this tactic I use to stop fear from controlling my life...

First, let's deal with the irrational aspect of fear.

Why does fear so often seem irrational? And what even is irrational?

If something is irrational, it doesn‚Äôt make sense. A rational decision? Wake up and drink coffee. An irrational decision? Wake up, walk outside, and take a dump on your lawn.

I mean, if that‚Äôs your thing, all power to you.

But here‚Äôs the thing: rationality is just whatever makes sense to you. If you‚Äôd been fertilising your lawn this way for years, it wouldn‚Äôt seem irrational at all. It would just be how things are.

What we see as rational or irrational is just perception.

Now let‚Äôs apply that to fear.

Fear is just a reaction to a perceived threat. That‚Äôs the key word‚Ä¶ perceived.

If you believe dogs are dangerous, you‚Äôll feel fear when you see one.  
If you believe poverty is the worst thing that could happen, financial struggles will trigger panic.  
If you believe rejection is unbearable, you‚Äôll avoid situations where it‚Äôs even possible.

But what if the threat isn‚Äôt real?

What if fear isn‚Äôt actually blocking you, it‚Äôs guiding you?

Fear is not a roadblock, it‚Äôs a signpost. It‚Äôs the gatekeeper to growth. It asks, ""how badly do you want more from life?""

If the answer is not badly enough, fear wins. You turn back. If the answer is I refuse to back down, you evolve.

Most people see fear as a stop sign. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a test.

Fear shows you exactly where you need to go.

That‚Äôs the game.

Now go start winning.

**TL;DR: Fear isn‚Äôt a roadblock. It‚Äôs a¬†signpost pointing to where you need to grow.¬†Most people see fear as a reason to stop but it‚Äôs actually a test.¬†If you move toward it, you level up.**

1jad92r,https://www.reddit.com/r/MacStudio/comments/1jad92r/best_macbook_companion_for_mac_studio/,Best MacBook companion for Mac Studio?,"I‚Äôm a full time photographer and looking into reconfiguring my setup for heavy photo editing + occasional video.

# My current machines:

**16‚Äù M3 Max MacBook Pro | 64GB RAM | 4TB SSD** (primary work machine)

**14‚Äù M2 Max MacBook Pro** | **32GB RAM | 1TB SSD (**meant to sell this upon getting the M3 Max, but‚Ä¶.haven‚Äôt yet. So it‚Äôs just been in a drawer)

**13‚Äù M2 MacBook Air** **|** My casual laptop for the couch

I have found myself wanting a **Mac Studio** for desktop power/stability vs docking the MBP. I don‚Äôt necessarily need more horsepower, but I love the idea of an always-on/always-available machine to be running backups and be generally more reliable. I use a Caldigit TS4 dock to attach peripherals and external drives and find that it occasionally causes a kernel panic or other random glitches. Not a dealbreaker, but it makes me nervous since I have a 60tb RAID attached and anything can happen. 

Also the clamshell aesthetic just bothers me a bit....this is purely vanity, but I am who I am!

# I‚Äôm trying to decide:

1. If this is worth doing at all
2. What the best companion laptop would be for occasional travel/coffee shop work, offloading footage on-site and being a bop around laptop at home.¬†

# Here are the options I‚Äôm considering:

**Option 1:** Keep 16‚Äù M3 Max + 13‚Äù M2 Air (Current system, and if I'm honest it works fine)

**Option 2:** Mac Studio + 14‚Äù M2 Max | Sell m2 air & M3 Max 

I love the form factor of the 14‚Äù MBP, but a second Max chip feels unnecessary and the 14‚Äù screen is too small for photo editing in my experience.

**Option 3:** Mac Studio + 15‚Äù M4 Air | Sell the M2 Max and M2 Air

To **Option 3** me this feels like the best of both worlds. I'd have a powerful desktop machine and a totally capable laptop with a big enough screen for the rare occasion that I use a laptop for doing work. It‚Äôs certainly he most expensive option and my main concern is that one day I‚Äôll find myself in a situation (eg. a jam) where I wish I had the pro. Most likely needing an SD card reader or the power to export something in a hurry.

Would love some input besides ChatGPT, who just tells me I‚Äôm doing great no matter what I say.

I‚Äôm uncertain, but I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm uncertain about.

The tips of my major fingers and toes are thawing now that I‚Äôm back inside, but that‚Äôs when they hurt the worst. Pictures on my phone suggest I was at a protest downtown. Pictures in my head would support that.¬†

But see, the thing is, I don‚Äôt go to protests.

And on a deeper bone-and-brain level, I do not protest. Ever.¬†

Like if I order a Coke and the waiter brings me a Diet Coke, I drink the Diet Coke and hope no one notices what happened.¬†

I get angry all the time of course. I just can‚Äôt turn it up to 11. I can do 3. Would that help? 3 is my 14. Once, well past midnight, after flying across the country, the guy at the Dollar Rent-A-Car counter in LAX told me I hadn‚Äôt actually reserved the car I had reserved. He informed me that what I had was the concept of a reservation. I asked him what exactly the fuck I should do then, at something more than a conversational volume. But even that wasn‚Äôt really me. By that point I had left my body and was watching, cringing from down the counter.¬†

Just thinking about protesting messes me up.

If I see a sheet of paper hastily scotch-taped in a coffee shop window calling for a People‚Äôs March for Justice, I become six years-old, standing on the steps of Albany City Hall, shivering and trying to hide my whole body behind a banner that my mom‚Äôs friends are holding but that‚Äôs flapping loose at the bottom. See there‚Äôs this thing called the Navy, I know that. And they‚Äôve got a new submarine. Submarines are cool. But the submarine has a lot of nuclear missiles on it, and nuclear missiles seem like too much. Navy is naming the new submarine U.S.S. Albany. Which, being from Albany, I think is pretty cool. But my mom and her friends don‚Äôt think so. They‚Äôre for peace. Uh oh, now they‚Äôre shouting all together, like singing but worse. If I duck my head down, only my feet will be visible under the banner. I also know that if you raise your voice and it‚Äôs not a fire, other people will look at you funny. Even if it was a fire they‚Äôd look at you weird. This is bad. I close my eyes. If they named the submarine U.S.S. Schenectady, could we go home? But it would still have the nuclear missiles though, right?¬†

I open my eyes and peek over the banner to see all the people staring at us. A dark car slides down and around the curve of Washington Avenue without slowing. As it passes, a man with a brown jacket and briefcase crosses the street. He probably hears us, but he doesn‚Äôt stop or look. And that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs happening in front of City Hall this morning. We‚Äôre doing the most embarrassing thing anyone has ever done and no one is watching us, which should make it better but actually this is worse.¬†

Years later, in college, I saw a protest. This was the late 1990s. Addressing serious injustices in public felt like being a Civil War reenactor. Like, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into. But.¬†

I was walking down the hill from the library with a friend. In polisci class we were reading *The End of History*. Its thesis - that everything cool had already happened, and nothing interesting would ever happen again - resonated profoundly with me as a suburban 19 year-old.¬†

As we got to the bottom of the hill, by the dining hall, there was a sound that was a lot of sounds: Louder than four drunk freshmen but not as loud as twelve drunk freshmen. People were trying to combine their voices, but their voices fit together like off-brand legos. Maybe 20 or few more people were walking in a bulge up the asphalt path. Some had flickering candles and maybe a few others had bobbing flashlights, but there wasn‚Äôt enough light anyway to read the signs they were carrying.¬†

‚ÄúTake back the night!‚Äù they chanted. ‚ÄúWe take back the night!‚Äù

It was a protest against sexual assault, my friend had to explain to me. ‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm against sexual assault and everything,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt it a bit like protesting against tornadoes?‚Äù

I stepped onto the grass to let them pass. I put on my vague-support smile at anyone who would glance at me. I didn‚Äôt get many takers. As the group pushed up the hill towards the administration buildings and bars on Center Street, I was struck less by the crowd and more by the vast emptiness around it: Worn brick rectangles of dorms separated by muddy, irregular lawns, and starting at the rural road where the college ended, fields giving onto woods giving onto fields giving onto woods, and just above those, the Universe, expanding at 160,000 miles per hour. It seemed to me then that the only way a normal person could respond to any of it, to all of it, was to shrug.¬†

So I shrugged, and voted Republican for the next 16 years.¬†

One of the counterintuitive surprises of getting older is that eventually you just can‚Äôt shrug anymore. The shoulder muscles won‚Äôt move. You go to say ‚Äúmeh‚Äù but what comes out is ‚Äúugh.‚Äù In the car and on the couch and at work you look at one screen, and then the other. Whenever you see a post that says ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt people in the streets!?!?!‚Äù you heart that post hard. Now you get protesting. You get it intellectually and emotionally. But you still don‚Äôt go because okay, you know what protesting does but what are you going to do at a protest? I can stand awkwardly at home just fine.

So I didn‚Äôt really know what was going to happen when I crossed North Pearl Street right by the federal building. Maybe I‚Äôd stand around. Maybe I‚Äôd engage in hand-to-hand combat for my life and have to gouge a Proud Boy‚Äôs eyes out with the foamboard ‚ÄúDown with DOGE‚Äù sign I‚Äôd made ten minutes ago. Or maybe, hopefully, I‚Äôd have messed up the dates and the protest wasn‚Äôt actually happening and I could turn around.¬†

But there were flags coming up the hill towards me as I got to the sidewalk, and a drum that was actually an overturned Home Depot bucket beating a rhythm.¬†

It was more than a group but less than a crowd, mostly I think because it was 7-degrees out and every horizontal surface in Albany County had been under an inch and a half of ice for the last week. If we‚Äôd tried to link arms and smash the establishment we would have fallen and bruised the tailbone of the people. This was a union-led thing to protest the firings of federal workers. A man with a beard and a bullhorn appeared and told us how awful everything was, and how proud he was of his union brothers and sisters. Then he handed the bullhorn to a different guy with a similar beard who said how proud he was of his union brothers and sisters.¬†

When they ran out of things to say we all shouted ‚ÄúFuck Elon.‚Äù Which is, just objectively, a lot¬†better than ‚Äúum‚Äù or ‚Äúso.‚Äù

When the speeches trickled out, the bucket started up and led us, waddling and sliding over the ice dunes to a corner of the building where we listened to the same speeches from another two guys who may have been different or may have been the same guys as before. Then the bucket drummed us out to the edge of the parking lot and we did it all one more time.

It was weird, for sure. But as we walked out to the parking lot passing buses honked.¬†

It was weird because when we got to the edge of the parking lot and instinctually packed in together for warmth, one of the beard guys took a group picture and then said ‚ÄúWell I promised I‚Äôd have you out by one. But before we go, does anyone want to say anything?‚Äù and he held the bullhorn up over his shoulder.¬†

If I‚Äôd known there was an open-megaphone portion to the event I would have prepared something. I did want to say something. I wanted to say everything.¬†

A woman stepped out from the crowd behind me and made her way up. She didn‚Äôt say her name when she took the mic. And in the cracks between her chunky sunglasses, pulled-down hat and long wool coat, she wasn‚Äôt that visible.

‚ÄúI grew up in the system,‚Äù she echoed. ‚ÄúOn food stamps and everything. Went to college. I worked on nutrition for New York State. Last year I got the chance to work on SNAP for USDA. Then two days ago I was fired. So I‚Äôm back where I started.‚Äù

And a few minutes after that I was blocks away, shivering in the car, in that moment when the heat is on but the air hitting your face is cold, back where I had started. So was everyone, I suppose.

But at least for an hour we had been together.¬†

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, and I really need to vent.

Last year, my husband had a severe burnout because of his job (he was being harassed by his manager). He ended up quitting and found another job that paid better and seemed more promising. Unfortunately, after three months, he fell back into depression. He didn‚Äôt want to go to work, kept fainting on the job, and eventually got fired because of his absences.

Since then, things have only gotten worse. He‚Äôs hopped from job to job, and each time, it ends badly. He got fired from three different jobs in a row because he wasn‚Äôt doing his work properly. The last one was a remote job, and he got fired in December. To be honest, I saw it coming.. he wasn‚Äôt taking it seriously at all and would sleep during his work hours.

After two months of unemployment, he recently found a new job as a community manager, which is his field. Before getting it, he kept saying he was sick of this career, that he felt trapped, but that he‚Äôd hold on until we move to Canada in two months to start fresh.

At first, he seemed motivated and worked hard. But now that Ramadan has started, everything is falling apart again. He‚Äôs addicted to coffee and cigarettes, and he says he can‚Äôt function properly without them. His boss seems understanding and flexible because everyone is struggling to stay focused during Ramadan, but I feel like my husband is taking advantage of that: he arrives late, leaves early, and today‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt even go. I came home at noon and found him asleep.

I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end. It‚Äôs been a year of this, and I‚Äôm the only one holding things together financially when we should be saving for Canada. I‚Äôve tried to be supportive, but I just can‚Äôt anymore. I‚Äôm terrified he‚Äôs going to lose this job too, and I don‚Äôt have the energy to keep pushing him.

I feel so stuck. Has anyone been through something similar? How can I help him find his motivation again, especially with our immigration coming up? I‚Äôm completely lost‚Ä¶

1jacza9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jacza9,Margaret Howell's latest collection reevaluates proportions,"Margaret Howell's latest collection ""reevaluates proportions,"" which in fashion terms means, ""We've made the pants longer. Go ahead."" And they're running a palette of ""Khaki Brown, Mahogany, Storm Grey, Oatmeal, Charcoal and Off White""‚Äîwhich sounds less like a color scheme and more like a list of things you'd find in an old bookstore that also sells coffee. 

What I like about Margaret Howell is that she makes clothes for real people. Not the kind of fashion that only works if you stand completely still in a minimalist gallery looking like you're contemplating existentialism. No, these are clothes for people who have a life! 

She pulls on the ""threads of British tradition,"" which I guess means you can look like an Oxford professor and a really stylish librarian at the same time. 

The brand is sold at Nitty Gritty, a store where you go in to ""just look"" and come out with a jacket for 12,000 kronor - but that's okay because you suddenly look like someone writing poetry about the countryside stuck on a MacBook Pro.",1,1741875392.0,u_grittygaloremagazine,0,1.0,False

I told him i was trans Mtf in my twenties and he was fine with it being what he was looking for. We had been messaging for like weeks and we decided to start facetiming. He seemed really cute and nice but not really thinking about anything right away. He told me he was looking for something serious and wanted to meet me. So we had decided that we were gonna hang out and then was gonna come to his place and he bought food to make something and i was gonna spend the night. He came pick me up and everything was fine. We were chilling at his house , smoking , drinking coffee , watching tv. The vibe was there and i felt chill and he was complimenting me like every 5 min. Until like 4 hours later he started behaving super weird and told me he wanted me to leave and that he hadn't forgetten his ex blablabla that he wasn't ready for a relationship blablabla üò±Then he started saying he wasn't feeling good (physically). So i just left and since i arrived to my place he has been sending me 50 thousand messages. Hey did you arrive good? how do you feel? wanna talk? are you ok? facetime?I wasn't feeling good so i went to the Dr?....... Like what do you want? i have not been responding. Should i respond , block , confront?

I‚Äôm 8 months pregnant and I‚Äôm not only physically tired, I‚Äôm mentally tired. I just got over being sick only for something else to hit me. I have asthma and terrible reflux and they‚Äôre working together to make my evenings difficult. My patience is fine with the kids for the majority of it, but the rooms right now are set for the winter and only the owner can change them. This means it was like 80 degrees in our classroom yesterday when the weather was closer to 70 degrees. By the end of the day I was so dizzy and my face was flushed, I couldn‚Äôt begin to think straight. I know I was a little testy and I feel bad about this. I‚Äôve worked my entire pregnancy, literally started at this center after I‚Äôd done the deed and was already about to get a positive test- usually there‚Äôs been nothing but good things to say with my interactions with the kids. 

Yesterday, at least for the last two hours of the day, I don‚Äôt agree with that. Now, I wasn‚Äôt mean to them- I would never belittle kids or make them feel like I don‚Äôt care about them. I just was shorter, clearly a pinch frustrated, and maybe had an edge to my usually soft/normal tone.

I‚Äôve been coming home with random bruises. I don‚Äôt know where they‚Äôre from. I know a few of them, I‚Äôve walked into things. One or two might be from an out of line kid hurling something at me. 


I have until mid April before my maternity leave, unless he comes earlier which a lot of my coworkers are suspecting he might but we will see what the OB says at the 37 week appointment in a couple of weeks. 

I‚Äôm genuinely thinking of treating myself to a coffee this morning from McDonald‚Äôs to try and reset the tone for myself. But to the kiddos who saw a slightly different side of me yesterday, I‚Äôm sorry, and I hope I get the chance to make it a better day for us today. ü•≤

1jacydt,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1jacydt/pr_on_a_budget_the_good_the_bad_the_lechon/,"PR on a budget: the good, the bad, the lechon","Just got back from a beautiful week in PR with my son. We were both needing relaxation and I needed to spend as little as possible, so after reading this sub for awhile here's what I did.

Car: Took a chance on U Save and had zero issues and less than an hour wait total for pickup and dropoff.  SUV was $17 per day including toll charges. With fees, $148 for the week. It was worth it to me to save so much even though everyone here warns against the budget rentals away from the airport. 

Lodging: 2 nights in SJ, 2 nights in Luquillo, 2 nights in Carolina averaged $90 per night. $540 for 6 nights. Zero complaints about the air bnbs, but we were prepared for a budget stay--these places weren't the Hilton but they were clean, safe, and had what we needed.

Flight: Took Spirit which was super cheap from the east coast. I would not do this again. Not only is the bag fee exorbitant but the flights are crammed and seats are tiny. $359 total for our flights and 1 checked suitcase each way. I will gladly spend more on a better airline experience next time.

Food: Budgeted $75 per day for food total. Some days we went over, some days under. Went to WM on day 1 (another thing I wouldn't do again as it was an overwhelming experience and really stressed me out) for breakfast and snack supplies. $642 for food for the trip which included an expensive meal at the airport because we had to return the rental car. The only place I really went over budget. In my opinion it's easy to eat cheaply in PR if you are careful, and the money we spent at WM wasn't necessary. We left most of that food behind when we left. 

Alcohol: I bought rum on day 2 because it is everywhere and amazing and cheap, and I made my own drinks. This saved a ton of money over the week and I relaxed on the beach with a frozen cocktail often. When I ordered a drink from a food stand or restaurant it didn't seem like a good enough value for the amount of buzz it gave me.

We did:
4 different beaches in OSJ and Luquillo
El Yunque hike to Mt Britton
OSJ window shopping day
Guavate for lechon
Visited many local food spots 

Total spent: $1766 for the week, including parking for a week at home airport. 

---

LOVED: We absolutely loved the people, the vibes, and the weather. We got to see Luquillo and experience the kiosks, El Yunque and the ridiculously tiny 2 lane roads, visit local bakeries for breakfast (seriously every place had amazing coffee!), go to Guavate and have the delicious lechon and pina coladas, and experience Old San Juan. 

WORRIED ABOUT FOR NO REASON: Having been warned about the drivers, it was mostly amusing and honestly no worse than any big city. If you can drive in CA, DC, NY, Boston, Houston etc you'll be just fine. Potholes are NO joke though! I kind of enjoyed the constant merging and zero turn signals. It's like a big game of Tetris that everyone seems to know the rules for.

WORRIED ABOUT FOR NO REASON PART 2: Absolutely everywhere we went, someone spoke enough English to help us except (ironically enough) in SJ on the last day when we tried to get gas and get the rental car washed. We did our best with Google translate and people were unfailingly kind. The people were the best part of the trip! 

WORRIED ABOUT FOR NO REASON PART 3:
We got cash but really only needed it in Guavate and with beach food vendors in Luquillo. Everyone took cards or apple pay. Maybe it was just where we were but it was not an issue.

HATED: Stray animals were definitely a thing and it was hard to deal with, especially when they were visibly hurting/sick. We saw the most strays in Guavate but there was at least one abandoned dog on every beach we went to. SJ had tons of roosters and chickens where we stayed but they all looked happy. The stray animals were really the downside of the trip and I had to work hard to stop thinking about it. 

DIDN'T PLAN FOR: We needed a PR e-sim to communicate with anyone at all when not on wifi and even that was spotty. Unless we were on wifi we got no messages, even from each other. (We have Verizon, I don't think this is an issue with every carrier.)

WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY PART 1: Spirit Airlines. Enough said.

WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY PART 2: Walmart. I don't know why this seemed a good idea to me but visiting a 4-story WM with a parking deck, laid out totally different than any WM I'd ever been in, where people spoke little English on the day we landed just made the travel day so rough. We ended up buying things we couldn't use up before leaving in the attempt to save money.

WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY PART 3: Learn more phrases in Spanish. I am determined to know how to do things like order food, get gas, and have some semblance of a conversation with the friendly wonderful people before our next trip. 

WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY PART 4: Spend 2 days at least in Rincon/Aguadilla instead of 4 days in SJ. SJ was interesting for 1-2 days but it's mainly a big touristy city and since we weren't going there to party we could've experienced Rincon beaches instead. Next time we will spend a week in Rincon and surrounding areas.

Thanks to this sub for sharing so many great recommendations and tips so I felt more confident planning our trip. We have lots of great pics and memories!

1jacy4l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jacy4l,Need help finding rooms for my nendoroids.,"So pictured above i put an example of the nendoroid playsets a&b and a ro life super creator store (the coffee shop) i like for my nendoroids (i haven't bought yet, but i like the style), as you could see  the 1st image is the set and 3rd image is rolife, while pictures 4&5 are how they match what I'm looking for. My problem comes especially when looking for a home. I like how the nendoroid playsets come in 2 parts to make it more roomy (even though it's literally basically double the price since it's 2 pieces making 1 room),but i dislike that there is no roof feature to put rooms on top of eachother. The rolife sets to me are a bit cluttered and look old fashioned (like my grandparents house) while what I'm looking for would be more modern and simplistic like the other images i provided. I like the concept of the rolife super creator kits because they are plastic, easy enough to put together, and they are stackable either side by side, or on top of eachother. Other sets are either wooden and harder to put together (you can't just snap them into place, but have to cut and glue) or just have 2 walls and a floor so you can't really stack them, or just plain aren't the style I'm looking for (like the rolife rooms and kitchen that look like they're from the 50's style).
