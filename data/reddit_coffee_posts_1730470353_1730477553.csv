And while resting and drinking a lot of water could be a factor, I realised that once I had my first real cup of coffee today, a lot of my symptoms were instantly relived. I just felt so refreshed and had a good energy boost as well (as expected.) 

Maybe it's just me, but I have noticed a few times in the past where coffee helped kill off any beginning symptoms for me and was wandering why that could be the case. Anyone else here experience something similar? Is there any truth behind this sentiment and what's the science behind this happening?",1,1730477434.0,NoStupidQuestions,0,1.0,False

1gh914m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gh914m,"What I ate in Souther Oregon, USA in 72 hours (with prices.)","I travel extensively for personal / leisure rather than business and this is what I ate in 72 hours as a Celiac in Southern Oregon, USA.

üíô The state of Oregon doesn't have sales tax.
üíô So many restaurants are closed on Sundays.
üíô Southern Oregon is rural and the options are dismal for gluten-free.

Day 1:

‚≠ê In-N-Out: they only have fries in their fryer so it's safe for celiacs. I say, "" I have Celiac disease, so gluten allergy in your system."" 

Double-double: 2 hamburger patties, 2 slices of cheese. 
Protein style: lettuce wrapped with no bun.

How I order: ""1 Double double, protein style with grilled onions, gluten allergy. 1 Fries, gluten allergy.""

I order all food for my party as ""gluten allergy"" so they don't get confused on which items are mine. 

‚≠ê Costco: Got some Black Forest fruit bars for the car / hotel room. $15.99. We took most of these home because it's a huge box.

‚≠ê Mello Coffee Roasters: ordered a white chocolate granita but couldn't see on the menu board that it was just a blended drink rather than a true granita until I zoomed in with my camera. 16 ounces for $6.25.

Day 2

Not a lot of options before 11 AM and we had to get on down the road to drive to Oregon Caves National Monument so we just went to the grocery store.

‚≠ê Albertsons Market (grocery store): got a $7.99  premade salad from the refrigerated section and asked for a fork from the deli. Also got some $3.50 Kettle brand Dijon mustard chips for the car / hotel room. We had so many chips leftover we packed them in our luggage to take home.

‚≠ê The Vine: there was a Yelp app check-in offer for a free non-alcoholic beverage so I got a guava Italian soda. The owner or someone in the family has Celiac so their fried foods are gluten-free. Got gluten-free fried mushrooms for $15 which felt really expensive for what we got. Also got the $24 gluten-free chicken parmesan that came with penne. There was an undisclosed upcharge to make it gluten-free which I thought was annoying.

Day 3

‚≠ê Starbucks: 30 ounce iced, unsweetened green tea for $4.75 & their gluten-free marshmallow dream bar for $2.50. 

‚≠ê Mochi Donut House - unlike other mochi donut places, this one is gluten-free. We ordered 6 donuts to-go and took most of them home. I like the pandan (green) one best. The purple one is ube / taro. 

‚≠ê Hawaiian Hut: They brought their ingredients out so I could check them to make sure there was no gluten in their food. It's just pork + liquid smoke and rice. I was able to make 3 meals out of thie $15 large plate because it was so much food. I added the $2.99 kimchi that I bought from Albertsons earlier in the week because I needed some sauce with flavor in my rice. ",1,1730477327.0,Celiac,1,1.0,False
1gh8zse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibroids/comments/1gh8zse/my_fibroid_and_open_myomectomy_experience/,My fibroid and open myomectomy experience,"When I was investigating my options I loved reading others experiences of their myomectomy so I wanted to share mine.

Diagnosis 

I first learned I had a 2 cm intramural fibroid when I was pregnant with my son in 2020. My pregnancy was uncomplicated although the fibroid grew to 10 cm by the time I delivered. I was able to have a vaginal delivery and by 6 weeks postpartum the fibroid shrunk to 2-3 cm. I had an IUD placed at that time.

In early 2022 I planned on removing my IUD to start trying for a second baby. The week before I had my appointment I realized my IUD flipped upside down. My doctor was still able to remove it but it was really difficult. 

We tried for a baby for about 1 year before decided to make an appointment with my OBGYN. We did labs on me, an ultrasound, and a spermanylsis. The ultrasound showed that my fibroid had grown to about 11 cm. We then did an MRI which confirmed the size. My doctor told me she felt she couldn‚Äôt safely remove it as she doesn‚Äôt perform many myomectomies. She referred me to another doctor in the same clinic but he also said no to performing the surgery. She then decided to refer me to the local reproductive endocrinologist. Unfortunately in my community there is only one so this referral took 8 months. 

While I was waiting for that appointment my periods got heavier and heavier with huge clots coming out. I was soaking through an ultra tampon in 45 minutes and that would go on for 5-7 days. I asked to have my iron levels checked because no one had offered. My hemoglobin was 6.1 and my ferritin was less than 1. I was dangerously anemic. I ended up getting two units of blood and then got two iron infusions which bumped my hemoglobin up to around 10 and my ferritin to 15.

The doctor who did my surgery was great. At my
appointment with him he was so validating about my experience with this large fibroid. It felt good to have a doctor recognize how much of my life had been affected by this thing.

He recommended doing an open myomectomy with a bikini incision because my fibroid was so large and because I want to have another baby.

Surgery day

I just had surgery a few days ago on 10/30. I had a 2 pm surgery time so I had to arrive at 12. I couldn‚Äôt eat anything after midnight but was allowed to drink water and black coffee until 10. I arrived to the hospital and they placed an IV and gave me some Tylenol. The doctor and the anesthesiologist came and talked to me. They wheeled me into the OR and had my slide into the operating table. He put a mask on me and had me breathe and I fell asleep right away.

My doctor told me my fibroid had degenerated so it was mushy and kinda came out in pieces. He said this is because it outgrew its blood supply. It weighed 1.5 pounds and the pathology already came back normal!

Post op

The next thing I know I was waking up in the PACU. I‚Äôm not gonna lie to you, I felt really painful. They gave me a few doses of IV pain medicine and then some oxycodone. By the time I got to my hospital room I needed a bigger dose of pain medicine. I was able to eat a light dinner. I tried to get up to the bathroom but that was too painful so I went in a bedside commode. A few hours later I was able to walk to the bathroom with help. By morning I could get to the bathroom alone. I needed pain medicine every 3 hours.

By the morning time I started experiencing gas pain.  This pain was honestly worse than my incision. It felt like a sharp stabbing pain in my shoulder. The cure for this is getting up and moving, applying heat, and taking gas ex. The pain was so bad I got nauseous and threw up which does not feel good with an abdominal incision.

Home

I was discharged home around 11 the day after my surgery. I‚Äôm a nurse so I think that‚Äôs the only reason why I got to go home so early. I maybe could have stayed a little longer but it was good to get moving because the gas pain was excruciating. It would feel worse when I leaned back a little and my first time in my bed I cried I was so painful. I needed to stay on top of medications so I was rotating Tylenol, ibuprofen, and my prescription oxycodone. I kept a heat pad on my shoulder and had my husband rub my shoulder frequently to relax the phrenic nerve that gets irritated from the gas pain. I try to get up
and walk around my house frequently to relieve the gas but it‚Äôs not completely gone yet. I sometimes use ice on my incision but a small pillow to splint when talking, coughing, sitting and standing, and walking helps a lot. I cannot get in and out of bed by myself so it‚Äôs good to have help. My husband is helping me with everything and my MIL is here to help with our son and cooking us meals.

I have not had much of an appetite so I‚Äôm eating things like pudding, broth, pur√©ed soup, cottage cheese, and jello. Also drinking lots of liquids like water, tea. 

I have stairs and my bedroom is upstairs and I can go up them just fine if I move slow but I can only handle once a day. My first day home I slept all day. Today I feel more alert and want to sit on the couch and watch TV.

So now after more than two years of secondary infertility and nearly bleeding to death I am fibroid free! I‚Äôll have a few post op appointments but it sounds like my doctor will clear me to start trying for another baby in about 3 months.

She is gaining weight though so the doctors have been dismissive and insisting all of this is normal. Out of desperation I cut dairy at the beginning of October and after 2 weeks saw a big difference in her demeanor. Actually happy after passing stool, poops were pastier/seedier with less mucus. Then I accidentally had a coffee with milk and we were back to colic level episodes at night, constant straining to poop etc. Pediatric GI finally said thst this could indicate ""a trigger"" and recommended i also cut out soy. 

anyway, its now been 2 weeks soy and dairy free and her skin has cleared, poops slowly improving, she is happy after BMs. of course, i slip up again last night and had miso pork belly which has fermented soy bean! Probably had 3-4 pieces before I realized and stopped.

Im not sure if soy is a trigger yet but had a couple questions: 

- if I ate dinner around 7 pm, how long would it take to cause a reaction in baby? I breastfed that night around 7:30-8 and again at 2 am. 
- how long will it take to leave baby‚Äôs system? Similar to dairy timeline?

Short Devotional about Gratitude

Introduction
------------

Welcome, dear friend, to a journey of gratitude that promises to transform your heart and outlook on life! In a world filled with hustle and bustle, it‚Äôs easy to overlook the simple blessings woven into the fabric of our daily existence. Gratitude shifts our focus from what we lack to the abundance surrounding us, filling our hearts with peace and joy. Today, we invite you to pause, breathe, and discover the transformative power of gratitude.

Imagine beginning each day with a fresh perspective, noticing the beauty in ordinary moments and expressing thanks for the goodness in your life.

Bible Verse
-----------

‚ÄúGive thanks in all circumstances; for this is God‚Äôs will for you in Christ Jesus.‚Äù ‚Äî 1 Thessalonians 5:18 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

The verse from 1 Thessalonians encourages us to give thanks in all circumstances, not just when things are going well. This means that gratitude isn‚Äôt conditional on our circumstances but rather a posture of heart that we choose, a decision to recognize God‚Äôs sovereignty and goodness even in the midst of challenges.

Gratitude reminds us that every good thing is a gift from above, and it prompts us to trust in God‚Äôs plan even when we cannot see the full picture. By giving thanks in all situations, we align our hearts with God‚Äôs will and open ourselves to experience his peace, which surpasses all understanding.

Moreover, practicing gratitude enhances our ability to see God‚Äôs hands at work, transforming trials into growth opportunities. Each experience, good or bad, becomes a stepping stone in our faith journey, shaping us into the person God intends us to be.

Actions to Take
---------------

- **Start a Gratitude Journal:** Each evening, write down three things you‚Äôre grateful for. Focus on simple joys and unexpected blessings.
- **Express Gratitude to Others:** Tell a friend, colleague, or family member why you appreciate them and the impact they have on your life.
- **Pause to Pray:** Take a moment throughout your day to thank God for His presence and blessings, even in challenging times.
- **Practice Mindfulness:** Pay attention to the present moment and recognize the beauty around you, from the sunrise to the laughter of loved ones.
- **Share Your Gratitude Story:** Share on social media or in conversation about how gratitude has enriched your life, encouraging others to adopt a grateful heart.

Heavenly Father,

I come before you with a heart full of gratitude. Thank you for the many blessings you‚Äôve poured into my life, both seen and unseen. Teach me to cultivate a thankful heart in all circumstances, trusting in your perfect plan. Help me to live each day with an attitude of gratitude that reflects your love and grace. Strengthen my spirit to be a beacon of hope and thankfulness to those around me. In Jesus‚Äô name, I pray.

Amen.

1gh8vze,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1gh8vze/literally_its_not_that_hard/,"Literally, it's not that hard.","I got coffee this morning from a place I used to work. Its basically a regional version of Starbucks. I quit there 8 months ago and only go occasionally for a treat. But there's a problem.

An old coworker of mine still works there and she hates me. She's like 15 years older than me and has one of those forced cheerful personalities. Talks nice but then is a massive bitch behind your back. She insisted I was rude and bossy towards others but when speaking with them they disagreed. When I know what needs to happen I am assertive and she couldn't handle that apparently. To the point that she got so mad at me she called me a bitch infront of other coworkers and customers and stormed out.

Our old manager was a piece of work and said she was going to write her up for it... I have no proof she did and personally, I doubt it.

Anyway, onto this morning. I show up and order a Small Caramel  Machiato with no foam.

For those who don't know, the Starbucks machiato is not a true machiato. A TRADITIONAL machiato is literally just espresso and foam on top.

So what I ordered was 2 shots of espresso with 3 pumps of caramel. Extremely easy. One of the easiest things on the menu especially since I wanted NO FOAM.

She calls my drink and notice immediately that it is filled to the brim. A small machiato only takes up about a third of the cup. So immediately I know it was made wrong. Interaction went like this.

Me: There's not supposed to be milk in this. Its just espresso and caramel.

Her: It says Add Milk

Me: Oh, well it shouldn't. I asked for no foam though.

Her: Well it does. I'll remake it for you.

I look up at her screen and see that it says this

SM Machiato
Caramel
2% Milk

Something about the caribou system, is that it forces you to pick a Milk option whenever Milk is applicable to the drink. The machiato gets foam, which is made from Milk. So no, the screen didn't say ADD Milk, it was telling her to make the foam with 2% Milk. If it was actually adding milk, it would say ""ADD 2% Milk""

Recognizing the mistake as something I had done myself from time to time, I can forgive that. But I realize that my request for no foam wasn't inputed on the order. What she gave me didn't even have foam... even if she added Milk by mistake it should have had foam. At that point I'm just reminded how incompetent she is and why i avoid coming here when she is working. But I figured i would give it a try since i really wanted it... but now I am regretting my choice to get coffee.

So I shrug and scoot to the side since she finishes another drink before remaking mine. I'm looking around and I hear her say very irritably ""You'll need to wait""

I was confused and said ""umm, I gathered that""

She shot me a glare and said, ""not you, HIM""

I can't help but think that's rude. The person working the till for her is one of the upper managers. He's a nice enough guy, but he must have been covering for someone because he asked me where the machiato was on the till. Why would you talk to your manager, and the person helping you, like that? Seriously, if you can't handle the heat gtfo of the bar.

While waiting, she finishes a different drink. A small turtle mocha. I look around and see a lady start approaching but stop. I ask her if she had gotten a small turtle mocha, and she responds that she did, but hers comes in a medium cup because it is specially made.

I instantly recognize her order as a regular is used to make every day. Small turtle, extra whip and topping, in a medium cup to fit the extra whip. Again, I know she messed up that order, but I don't say anything because that's not my business. I'm also guessing that manager dude didn't ring it up right so I can't blame the bitch for that.

When I do get my drink, assuming it is made right since it is LITERALLY ONLY ESPRESSO AND CARAMEL, I leave.

Get to work and take a sip... the bitch just poured out most of what she made originally for me. So instead of my machiato, I got one third of a small late. Color me pissed.

So, I took a picture and called. I'm getting what I paid for later today. Also getting the receipt to prove what I asked for and what I actually got before making a complaint.

She doesn't have to like me, that's fine. I hate her too, but you work for a business, at least make the damn drinks right.",1,1730476973.0,venting,1,1.0,False

1gh8v7u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gh8v7u,"Gustavo Era | Hard reboot of my Brazilian dictator alterego TL, set in the interwar period instead of the cold war (I am not a fascist)","Gustavo Ferreira Henrique was born in S√£o Paulo on 9 November 1887, to a middle-class civil servant and his housewife. Between 1911 and 1914, attended S√£o Paulo's faculty of law and graduated top of his class, eventually serving as a lawyer between 1916 and 1921 and becoming well-known for his extensive historical and legal knowledge and oratory skills. 

In 1918, Gustavo married a German immigrant, Guilhermina Augusta (originally named Wilhelmina Augusta) out of love. The two had three children, J√∫lio C√©sar (1919‚Äì1985), Fernando (1922‚Äì1975) and Joana (1926‚Äì2010). 

Privately, during the early 1920s, Gustavo, like many other Brazilians, became disappointed with the oligarchic First Republic, instead advocating for a nationalist and protectionist dictatorship that would industrialize and modernize the country while protecting its Catholic culture. He soon became the leader of the intellectual wing of Tenentismo, and took part in the 1922 Modern Art Week, championing the nationalist and Catholic wing of the ""modernismo"" cultural movement. During this time, Gustavo wrote several novels and political works, which were moderately successful. 

In 1926, Gustavo founded and became the leader of S√£o Paulo's Democratic Party, which opposed the coffee planters' oligarchy and championed political reform. The party supported Get√∫lio Vargas for President in 1930, with Gustavo writing Vargas's program and taking into account the ideological differences between the two¬π. 

After Vargas lost, Gustavo and Tenentista officers Pedro Aur√©lio de Go√≠s Monteiro, Eduardo Gomes and Juarez T√°vora¬≤ began planning a revolution against the government, to be led by the states which formed the Liberal Alliance. The Revolution eventually broke out, with Gustavo as its political leader, and resulted in 25 years of right-wing dictatorship.

**Footnote**

- ¬π = I would be more of a traditionalist and outsider than the positivist career politician Vargas.
- ¬≤ = Both of these guys would share my authoritarian and anti-communist views. Nevertheless, some of them would break with my regime.",1,1730476923.0,AlternateHistory,6,0.99,False

I was in the keto flu phase, trying to find the balance of food, electrolytes, etc. Had to go to doc fasted (but drank coffee) for bloodwork, was on hour 17, felt not great.

My numbers came back as follows:

Feeling a bit anxious as triglycerides doubled from last year, HDL dropped from 98 and LDL is up 54 more as well. 

People in keto community believe I should retest in a few months as my results were likely impacted by just starting keto. However my doc asked me to either start medication or retest in a month. She doesn‚Äôt think keto has an impact. I‚Äôve opted to retest in a month. 

I think if my retest is still high, I‚Äôd rather go the route of altering diet than medication. Is my doctor‚Äôs recc of medication a reasonable reaction? (She did acknowledge it was strange results given my physicality.)",1,1730476907.0,Cholesterol,0,1.0,False

1gh8twd,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1gh8twd/employee_resents_me_personally/,Employee Resents Me Personally,"I'm 25 and work for a company in the niche market of X-ray diffraction/X-ray Manufacturing. It's so Niche that people can't go to college to learn the work I do, instead, we try to hire people based on drive/how long they plan on staying with the company. 

I joined the company 6 years ago, worked my way up and a year ago was promoted to a lead supervisory role. The work environment is laid back, we push for results. If you have to walk away for 20 min and just clear your head, drink a cup of coffee or feel like talking to coworkers that's absolutely allowed. As long as you get the job done.

However, the other day one of my more autistic employees was curiously debating psychology with me. Going over the concept of ""We do things because they make us feel good, even if we don't choose to do them for that reason. Subconsciously we are"" and this query really set off a different coworker that was just overhearing our conversation. We'll call him (X). The more autistic one is (Y). 

(X) Debated that he doesn't do things because they make him feel good. He just does them because they're right. This debate started because of religion as well.. so I knew it was a hot topic and tried my best to keep it civil. He gave an example that when he offers that he ""knows a guy"" for a specific job (like concrete, car work, landscaping, etc) he's not doing that because it makes him feel good. Hes doing it just to help people. 

(Y) Agrees, and brings up holding open a door. That we hold open the door for people, not necessarily to make ourselves feel better. However, I view things as a ying yang. I debate that if you see someone coming, and you accidentally DONT hold open the door for someone. Do you feel bad? Implying that we feel bad when we don't do good things. Which means we feel good when we do them.

At this point (Y) agrees with me. But (X) stands firm and says no. That if someone's too slow, or he accidentally doesn't hold open the door for someone. He's not going to feel bad in the slightest. He wouldnt hesitate. Which, made (Y) and I raise our eyebrows a little. I couldn't really believe it. We debated a few other examples. And honestly, this is purely my speculation, but I'm convinced (X) is most likely this way because he was in the military and was trained to always do the right thing, instead of debating what is right or wrong. You purely just assume what is right, and do what's right. I didn't say this to him. But I did say ""Sounds like we're starting to debate on what is Man vs Machine."" As, reacting to things without hesitation or question like this, makes me think more machine. Now. I didn't mean for this to obviously imply I'm calling him a machine.. was just trying to have a nice conversation about psychology. But this really made (X) mad and the conversation quickly ended. 

I've noticed the past week he's been extremely petty. I shrugged it off. But he's been doing small things, like purposely only talking to other coworkers about day to day things and ignoring me completely. Before this, he used to happily talk to me and another coworker about everything in his life. But now it's just making me feel really weird. Should I confront him and say sorry? I feel as though his personality doesn't get over these things. And even if I tried bringing it up now. He would act like he hasn't thought about it since and nothing has been different. So, should I let sleeping dogs lie and hope time makes a difference? He's a hard working employee. So that side of it, I'm definitely not trying to make things worse. We've even all gone to things outside of work together. So I really just don't know how to deal with petty grievances like this.",2,1730476846.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

1gh8tmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1gh8tmo/had_my_first_colposcopy_today/,Had my first colposcopy today,"I had of course read every story in this community. I‚Äôve been so poked and prodded for two years now for various health issues that the procedure itself didn‚Äôt worry me so bad, but the fear before this about what could be found was KILLING me. 

Anyway, got there, cried pretty quick to the doctor during pre-procedure despite being clonazepam-ed up to high heavens. I was on pins and needles when she said if she does biopsy, she believes from personal experience the anaesthetic is worse than without üëÄ she said if it comes to it I can have it but she wanted me to have the choice and know her personal experience (she‚Äôs had it). 

I personally found the colposcopy itself to be largely uneventful, it reminded me of the discomfort of a transvaginal ultrasound, maybe a little more intricate poking around. I wouldn‚Äôt say it hurt, it was a range of uncomfortable pressures and sometimes made me feel like I needed to pee! I just sat there with a face of disgust at the feelings while she kept telling me I‚Äôm doing great and saying my cervix looks beautiful (in a non creepy, trying to be reassuring way) üòÇ

In the end she chose to not biopsy and do another colpo in 6 months because she wants to leave my immune system to take care of the cells. Evidently the abnormalities are so microscopic it‚Äôs not worth further intervention now, and they‚Äôre likely enforced by my parallel issues around recovery from some hormonal contraception damage and so on. 


What I really wanted to share is the acidic vinegar part of the procedure. WHY DOES NO ONE TALK ABOUT HOW IT FEELS LIKE YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN KICKED IN THE VAG, SPRAYED WITH PEPPER SPRAY AND A UTI AT THE SAME TIME?? I‚Äôm not being funny guys I feel like I‚Äôve had the roughest sex of my life and my vagina will fall out while I pee myself üò≠ it‚Äôs been 4 hours, I‚Äôve just woken from a slumber, I haven‚Äôt yet stood up, but the way I walked out of the hospital and from the taxi to my door could not really be considered ‚Äúwalking‚Äù. Disabled penguin comes to mind. All this going straight back to work nonsense, I can barely walk to the bathroom. In fact I sat in the bathroom for 30 minutes genuinely feeling like I need to pee, exactly like a UTI, when I didn‚Äôt. 

Overall I‚Äôd say my colposcopy experience has been positive, bar the part where like every oncologist she asked me to quit vaping to help my immune system fight off the high risk HPV. This made me cry - not because it‚Äôs an unreasonable ask - but because I don‚Äôt drink (my ADHD meds somehow make it unappealing), I don‚Äôt do drugs, I don‚Äôt drink coffee, I feel like it‚Äôs the last ‚Äúbad‚Äù thing I get to enjoy, and now I‚Äôm being asked to become a saint ü´† Like come on, let me have SOMETHING unhealthy to enjoy. Let me fucking live. But anyway that‚Äôs just a petty complaint I wanted to put out there today because I‚Äôm still bitter. But have bitterly loaded Allen Carrs Easyway onto my kindle‚Ä¶.

I've made a number of flights in MSFS mainly using the PMDG 737 and the HPG H145, both of which are running fine maybe with slight performance hits at peaktimes on VATSIM at some of the busiest airports. I've today downloaded the new FBW A380 and it's near unusable with stuttering... the external view is like watching a powerpoint and looking around the cockpit is not allot better if I'm looking towards the terminal at the maccosim EGCC. I know its not optimised yet but I wanted to run it by the collective if my system is actually up to the job of running this sim and if there are any settings modifications I can make that will improve performance and still give me a fairly reasonable looking sim. The thing I'm finding the most confusing is it seems that nothing is bottlenecking to cause these stuttering issues (I've just attempted to clear the cache and that's not really solved the issues)

I've attached my settings and system specifications and a taskmanager readout of my performance while on the stand at EGCC in the A380.

I have the budget (and ram slots) at the moment to potentially double my ram if this is something that could help, but as I say, I'm not really sure where my bottleneck is.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I didn‚Äôt think I was really bothered by people around me drinking/smoking/doing drugs, but it‚Äôs just sooo ubiquitous here in the ‚Äúscenes‚Äù of people in my field that I can‚Äôt avoid it if I want to go out once in a while. I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs and burned myself out superrr early in my late teens after going super hard on substances/self medicating in my teens, so these days I might have a couple of drinks on a night out (not more than 2x a week), but it isn‚Äôt fun for me when I surpass that frequency/ consumption, and I am completely sober from drugs of any other kind and will not touch them ever again probably.
My Aussie friends who have been to the US have confessed to me that they felt judged smoking ciggies in the west coast US cities because they were so alone in it, so I know they kind of understand where I‚Äôm coming from, and they don‚Äôt pressure me whatsoever about it since we are all kinda past that age, but idk if I can keep going out with them like this.
Do any of you Ameristralians have advice for me being a newbie to this drinking culture/ what to get at a bar that is cheap but not free, and doesn‚Äôt piss off the bartenders? I haven‚Äôt been able to find any cozy cafes that are open later than like 4pm, so I always end up at bars like the Black Cat or something in Fitzroy since they‚Äôre close to me. I‚Äôm sick of getting sick from inhaling the secondhand smoke, but I love hanging out with my new pals here, and they are otherwise pretty considerate and very generous. I feel pretty lucky with the connections I‚Äôve already been able to make. 
I was 100% sober from all substances (sans caffeine) for about 4 years in my late teens/early 20‚Äôs after my big blowout in my teens, so I know and use a lot of the things like smoking herbal ciggies, always having a (non alcoholic) drink in hand, etc. but it just doesn‚Äôt fully cut it here with the higher level of drinking that ppl partake in in their late 20‚Äôs/early 30‚Äôs. Most of my pals in similar careers in the US are actively quitting smoking after a decade (or 2) of it, and are chilling out, but that‚Äôs not the case here that I‚Äôve run into.

I have a very weird presentation of symptoms that I am not sure if they are MCAS or POTS related or if it is a low blood pressure issue or a combination of things. I know this also may not be the most appropriate sub but this account is too new to post in covid long haulers, I am technically a long hauler but my long haul symptoms ended a year ago, these symptoms seem separate and weirder than long haul. These episodes have happened several times and I thought it was hypoglycemia but I will go through what has happened yesterday for example.

 I Work part time and only 3 hours a day but today I worked a 6 hour shift. I ate overnight oats, a cereal bar and a yogurt smoothie for breakfast at 10:40 am. After breakfast meals I have a ginger lozenge to help my stomach. At around 2:00 pm I felt the I need to eat or I‚Äôll pass out feeling‚Äù so I had peanut butter on toast and felt better. But then I started feeling weird and lightheaded again, so I ate some pepperoni and had another ginger lozenge and I calmed down and felt better again.

Once again I was trying to stay calm, then on my way home I just felt like I‚Äôd pass out. I had a rush of adrenaline, arms felt numb and weak. I felt like I‚Äôd pass out. I don‚Äôt really know how to explain it and I just feel like I‚Äôm going to die.

The rest of the night was a cluster of symptoms. I chugged a Gatorade as soon as I got home, because I thought the sodium was what my body needed. and that made me too bloated to eat my dinner fully, so I didn‚Äôt get adequate nutrients again, lied in bed with hot flashes, weak shaky arms like I lifted weights and didn‚Äôt take care of myself after, then I went to the bathroom twice because of the adrenaline rushes and whatever I ate just completely left me causing me to lose even more nutrients. Because I couldn‚Äôt finish my dinner I just ate a yogurt drink and an oatmeal bar to hopefully help my body.

Today I forced myself to have coffee, eat cereal, then I ate a tuna sandwhich and protein yogurt. Now I just really don‚Äôt know what my body wants‚Ä¶ the Gatorade will probably make me sick, I feel bloated and nauseous, but I don‚Äôt know if my body is satisfied with what I tried to give it. I still feel shakey and weak like I lifted weights but didn‚Äôt eat enough afterword or drink electrolytes. My muscles just feel weird.

Typing this it sounds like I had the start of a bad panic attack and fucked my self over by force feeding myself and drinking a bunch of Gatorade because I thought it was POTS symptoms or dystaumia but I don‚Äôt know. It also seemed to start and present as MCAS, but it just went downhill and it was a huge mess. I don‚Äôt know how to take care of my body today honestly.",5,1730475935.0,dysautonomia,1,1.0,False

The last 1% is just a faint scream while I write this.

As someone who chronically over-explains and overshares, condensing my story into a query feels like running an Ironman. While my manuscript isn't completely finished, I‚Äôm starting to draft the query early because this is a character-driven story that I suspect will need several query iterations to get right. üòÆ‚Äçüí®

**My main priorities are:**

1. Capturing Clara's voice and dark humor,
2. Showing how this story differs from typical ED narratives (it focuses on someone who exists in that ""invisible middle space""),
3. Balancing the multiple threads (grief, ED, isolation) without making the query feel overcrowded.
4. Avoiding clich√©s and usual tropes, I am worried that it now sounds like the typical healing narrative.

**I‚Äôm particularly interested in feedback on:**

1. Whether Clara's voice comes through clearly,
2. If the balance between plot and character development works,
3. Whether the stakes feel clear enough for a character-driven story.

Another weak area are my comps. They‚Äôre not there yet, but I'm reading as much as I can between writing/editing breaks! So far, I have a couple in mind, like¬†HAPPY FOR YOU¬†by Claire Stanford,¬†VERA WONG'S UNSOLICITED ADVICE FOR MURDERERS¬†by Jesse Q. Sutanto, and Jennette McCurdy's¬†I'M GLAD MY MOM DIED (perhaps¬†MILK FED¬†by Melissa Broder as well...)

Thanks, PubTips, for any advice you can share!

**QUERY DRAFT:**

Dear agent,

Clara has perfected the art of disappearing in plain sight. She buys self-improvement books for a future self who's definitely coming (any day now), declines invitations with excuses so relatable no one notices she never says yes, and only speaks to Sophie when she's absolutely sure no one can hear her ‚Äì because Sophie‚Äôs been dead for a decade.

By day, Clara counts calories in black coffee and makes her coworkers laugh with spot-on impressions of their CEO. By night, she orders enough takeout from different apps that no delivery driver sees her twice, then hides the evidence at the bottom of her trash bin like murder weapons. Her eating disorder doesn't fit the stereotype ‚Äì not thin enough to look ‚Äúill‚Äù, not big enough to seem ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù, just invisible enough to keep everyone from asking questions.

When Clara discovers a tiny, rage-filled dog in her building's trash, she sees herself in those hungry, mistrustful eyes. As she struggles with this furious little dog who treats kindness like a trap, Clara finds herself doing the impossible: living a life that isn't measured in calories consumed, calls dodged, and hours until she can crawl back into bed. Not because she wants to, not because she's finally ready to ""get better,"" but because this dog needs her to.

But every morning walk, every awkward conversation with other dog owners, every small moment of actual living chips away at the walls Clara built after Sophie died. And as she gets her first real taste of the life she's denied herself for a decade, Clara realizes she can‚Äôt have both - the safety of her self-imposed exile and the chance to actually live again. Because facing why Sophie‚Äôs voice is all she has left means confronting the truth she buried along with her best friend all those years ago.

Complete at 85,000 words, HOW MANY CALORIES IN A FINGERNAIL is a literary fiction novel that will appeal to readers who loved the darkly humorous exploration of grief in X and Y (in the works!). While this novel walks through the dark corners of grief and disordered eating, it stumbles (sometimes literally, thanks to one very determined dog) into something unexpected: the possibility that recovery isn‚Äôt about fixing yourself to fit the world, but finding the courage to create your own place in it.

**First 300 words:**

The waiter sets down our food at Giuseppe's, our office's go-to place where the lights are always dimmed so low you'd think they're trying to hide something. Probably the fact that their ""imported Italian olive oil"" bears a suspicious resemblance to the generic stuff from the supermarket next door. Sarah's margherita pizza arrives in a cloud of steam, while Jen's fettuccine swims happily in a rich cream sauce. And then there's my dinner,¬†*The Artisanal Garden Salad*, looking like the contents of someone‚Äôs compost pile.

I push a piece of lettuce around my plate, dodging the croutons I told the waiter to leave off. ""How's the pizza?"" I ask, watching Sarah's first bite while trying very hard not to think about melted cheese and perfect crust and everything else I'm not supposed to want. Instead, I do what I always do ‚Äì count. Fifteen calories per crouton (why are they even here?), and that dressing... It's definitely creamy, probably hiding at least three hundred calories in there. Nice try, you delicious little liar. The wine in my glass catches the warm light ‚Äì another two hundred calories I shouldn't have ordered, but saying no when Jen from HR suggests drinks? Please. She's got that effortlessly cool thing going on, with her vintage band tees and intricate sleeve tattoos, and I'd really like her to like me.

Besides, after spending two hours trying to explain to a client that no, their car insurance doesn't cover damage from their teenager ""accidentally"" reverse-parking into their ex's front door, I think I've earned it.

I'd¬†*really*¬†love to tell you about my thrilling career in insurance, but honestly, if I think about it for one more second, I might spontaneously combust.

Here‚Äôs a bit of information I wish I‚Äôd known before our trip. That said, the trip was amazing‚Äîthe island is breathtaking, and the people are incredibly friendly!

Before we left, I compared rental car prices and read that some cars might struggle with Madeira‚Äôs mountainous terrain and treacherous roads. After seeing the roadways, I think most rental cars would handle it fine, but if you‚Äôre not confident driving in the mountains, consider other options. We ended up skipping the rental based on those comments.

We stayed in Calheta, about 30 minutes from Funchal (pronounced *foon-SHAL,* not *fun-kel* as I originally thought). Funchal is the island's largest city, where around 40-60% of the population lives (depending on who you ask). Calheta felt less dense and less congested, which was a nice change of pace, but it came with a few drawbacks. Dining options were limited outside our resort, and there weren‚Äôt any nearby laundromats. The resort‚Äôs laundry service was very pricey (‚Ç¨18 per shirt), while Funchal offers more reasonable laundry options, including services that deliver to your hotel.

**Highly Recommended Activities:**

1. **Off-Road Tours**: We did two 8-hour tours with Green Devil, and they were fantastic. The guides shared local insights, took us to remote spots we wouldn‚Äôt have reached on our own, and even recommended some amazing local eateries. Every tour started with, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stop for caf√© first‚Äù‚Äîthe coffee culture is strong here! They‚Äôll likely introduce you to *Poncha,* a local drink made from rum, honey, lemon, sugar, and juice.

1. **Hiking**: We hiked to 25 Fontaines with MB Tours, which was rated ‚ÄúIntermediate.‚Äù If that‚Äôs intermediate, I‚Äôd be wary of the harder hikes! The elevation changes were intense, so if you don‚Äôt do well with stairs or steep paths, consider easier options. Although I speak only English, our guide handled the tour in both English and French, which was impressive and inclusive.

1. **Buggy Rides**: Our ride with Let‚Äôs Buggy was a highlight of the trip. You drive off-road up the mountains and visit local eateries. Part of the trip involves driving on-road, so if that feels daunting, you might want to skip it.

**Must-Try Foods:**

* **Steak on a Bay Leaf Skewer**: Grilled on branches from bay leaf trees, the steak takes on an amazing flavor.

* **Island Sweet Potatoes**: These are unlike any I‚Äôve had before‚Äîabsolutely delicious!

* **Bolo de Caco Bread**: These can be loaves or stuffed with chorizo, it‚Äôs a local favorite and so tasty.

Locals advised us to skip buying fruit from the markets, where samples may be sweetened to taste better. The fruit you take home might not be as flavorful.

**Packing Tips:**

Prepare for both Summer and Winter weather. A 20-minute drive up a cliff can change the temperature drastically‚Äîsometimes by 10¬∞C or more! I was glad I packed a sweatshirt for the plane, and we ended up buying my wife a beanie, gloves, and wool socks because she gets cold easily. Also, a windbreaker is essential, as the wind at higher elevations can be intense and howling.

I‚Äôve deliberately avoided naming specific places to avoid mistakes with names or locations. You can easily find plenty of beautiful views with other searches.¬† Overall, this was an incredible trip, with wonderful people‚Äîespecially the locals.

1gh8cvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gh8cvl/a_world_transformed_by_james_walvin/,"A World Transformed, by James Walvin","The subtitle of the book is:  ""Slavery in the Americas and the Origins of Global Power.""  An awe-inspiring title, unfortunately not lived up to by the text!  Well, it would have to be 800 pages long to do the job right, right?  So that's not such an important complaint.  Moving right along.

The thing is... you see... the book is kind of sold as a scholarly effort.  That's how it's presented to browsers \[people who browse, that is, not internet discovery tools lol\], who pick it up wondering what to think.  A sober cover, nothing too dramatic in the blurbs, and apparently the author actually works as a Professor of History, or did in 2008, when the book was published.  And that's kind of misleading.  The book is actually semi-scholarly slavery porn, is what it is.

Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course!

And parts of the book really are valuable. I feel that the author's footnotes, for example, justifying this or that statement of his, probably are actually valuable references.  I've made a long list and I expect them to be scholarly works. Who knows, right?  I've been wrong before.

The author really does make a fairly good case that slavery has underpinned the whole Western project since 1500 or so.  He gives a lot of information that tends in that direction.  He lists the industries to which slavery was important, in the expansion of their global reach, and it's a significant list.  Sugar.  Tobacco.  Coffee.  Cocoa.  Dyes.  Rice.  Cotton.  Guano.  (Guano?  Guano.)  Lumber.  Rubber.  Textiles.  Rum.  Cowries.  (Cowries?  Cowries.)

He really does make a good point when he says that slavery provided a firm and lasting foundation for the ideal of civilization.  It wasn't a connection any of those who worked toward this ideal noticed, but it was a real connection.  Civility was something that certain people could afford.  It wasn't obvious that you could have that without a certain financial base, and it wasn't obvious what that financial base rested on, in many if not most cases.  So this is a good point, by the author.

And he really does make a good point when he notices that the only people who have been repaid, for slavery, were the owners of the slaves.  Britain in particular invested a great deal of money in paying the owners back for the slaves of whom they had been deprived, when abolition finally lowered its political boom on the island.  France did its level best to make Haiti pay for every single one of those who were liberated.

And he really does make another very good point when he points out just how many British benefited by these payments.  There were many British who had a significant ownership interest in slaves.  These people were compensated.

Where the book fails, most of all, is in its promise.  It seems to promise history, and instead it provides peeks.  Glimpses.  Vignettes.  What were the values of those industries that I mentioned, up above, and how did their values change over time, on a global scale?  How did their values compare to the values of other industries?  He doesn't seem to think the question is interesting.  What was the effect of the Atlantic slave trade on Africa?  He barely mentions the subject.  What is the difference between what we think of as slavery, and other related labor situations, like debt bondage, sexual slavery, serfdom et cetera?  Not his concern.  How much of the impetus to slavery was profit, and how much was religious strife, or nationalistic competition, or war, or local or not so local politics, or status, or who knows what?  Not his concern.  How did the Atlantic slave trade compare to the Islamic slave trade?  Who knows.

It's interesting to me that his poster child for reasons people got into slavery is that some industry or other wasn't profitable without it, and yet he doesn't discuss the economic consequences of ending slavery at all.  To me this is a notable failure.  But among so many others, you know, it hardly stands out.

So, you know... interesting, but not really valuable.  Not essential.

Meanwhile, his personality would be that of a confident, high-spirited, and bombastic individual with a chaotic and no-holds-barred sense of humor, a clear mad lad who is by all means batshit crazy, knows it, and is just having fun with it, his whole motivation being a hero for fun, treating it like a hobby. However, despite all of this, he does have the heart of a hero and is a genuinely good guy willing to help out whenever he can.

His antics would have a frenetic energy, an explosive mix of fearless physical gags, erratic wisecracks, and absurd surprise with loads of slapstick, randomness, and sharp wit, having the unpredictability of a Looney Tunes character with a dash of self-aware edginess and unfazed absurdity to annoy the hell out of or just confuse opponents, all the while bearing a confidence that borders on recklessness and a madcap personality, throwing  some of the most confusing and nonsensical trash talk at his enemies like ‚ÄúYOU THINK I‚ÄôM CRAZY?!

You say your world is black and white, everything tragically absurd,  
and hope lies impossibly distant.

Nothing goes right, and smiles turn to tears.  
You shatter your thoughts into fragments,  
falling from heights where remnants of history lie below.

You speed along in a car, your heart skips a beat,  
as the wind howls in your ears‚Äîa final warning from the god of life.

A delicious nightmare, tinged with champagne‚Äôs faint scent,  
loneliness laced with longing.

The leaves you kicked drift up on the breeze,  
blown to the ends of the earth, to a corner of the starlit sky.",1,1730475619.0,Poem,0,1.0,False

I today have been in out of curiosity to see the owner. Granted I was skeptical at first thinking ""he's probably a dick"". 

No, he is not. 

He gave me his version of events. And must say most of the stuff being posted is bullshit and shit stirring. 

He gave me free food, coffee and tea to try. If you are worried your food is shit or you have something to hide he wouldn't have done that. 

The food is great. Fresh, seasoned and tasty. It's all made right in front of you. If you're in the restaurant all the food is clearly on display. 

The owner and manager have been receiving threats on the phone, online and in person. They've even had to move there children out of the area due to some of there personal information appearing online. 

OUT OF ORDER!! STOP IT! 

Granted yes, the manager swore and was a little unprofessional. He's admitted that today. But when you have a restaurant full of diners and someone stood outside shouting abuse because he didn't get what he wanted I'd lose my temper a little as well. Especially after arguing with him for 10 minutes over nothing. 

To the original guy who started all this, stop it. Get over it. Do you even realise the upset caused to his family.

# Chapter Three

¬†¬†

How many times had I dreamed of this moment? How many nights had I imagined walking down the aisle, the love of my life waiting for me at the altar?

Everything was perfect. Almost everything. Except for the man standing at the end of that aisle, the man I was supposed to marry. The man whose eyes were filled with cold indifference instead of love. My heart ached, and I blinked back the tears threatening to spill, refusing to let them make a scene.

The ceremony was a blur, a haze of vows and traditions I barely registered. My thoughts were consumed with dread as I realized what awaited me ‚Äî a home where I'd be alone with him, a man who clearly didn‚Äôt want me.

During the car ride back, Sorin sat as far away from me as the backseat allowed, his gaze fixed outside the window, his silence as heavy as the tension between us. I wanted to say something, anything to break the ice, but the fear of irritating him kept my lips sealed. I couldn‚Äôt help but glance at him, at his strong profile, every feature so painfully familiar from the countless times I'd admired him from afar.

‚ÄúQuit staring. It's irritating.‚Äù His voice was icy, cutting through the silence like a blade. He cast me a brief glance, the look in his eyes sharper than his words.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I whispered, my cheeks burning as I quickly looked away.

[*Italian Beige Sofa Bed*](https://pandacozycorner.com/products/italian-beige-sofa)



  
When we arrived at his house ‚Äî no, his mansion ‚Äî it felt like stepping into a dream, or rather, a nightmare. The place was as grand as one could imagine, but it held no warmth for me. It wasn‚Äôt a home; it was a gilded cage.

I followed him inside in silence, my stomach in knots as he led me to our bedroom. ""Our"" bedroom. I hadn‚Äôt expected that. Seeing the surprise on my face, he rolled his eyes and sighed. ‚ÄúMy parents locked the other rooms. Apparently, they‚Äôre adamant that we sleep in the same one.‚Äù

Embarrassment washed over me. His parents clearly had hopes for this union that didn‚Äôt align with reality. He gestured towards the couch. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll sleep there.‚Äù

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. As I approached the couch, I noticed a pillow and blanket already laid out, a silent but clear arrangement. I sank into the cushions, trying to make myself comfortable.

""Wait."" His sudden command startled me. I turned, finding him pinching the bridge of his nose, visibly conflicted.

He sighed heavily. ‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù

Confused, I resumed my place on the couch. But before I could relax, he spoke again. ‚ÄúNo, wait.‚Äù He looked exasperated, as if warring with himself. ‚ÄúYou can... share the bed. If you‚Äôre comfortable.‚Äù¬†

I hesitated, my eyes drifting to the bed. It was large enough for both of us, but sharing it felt too intimate, too overwhelming. Still, the couch wasn‚Äôt exactly inviting either.

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I finally asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded stiffly. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Taking a deep breath, I got up and slowly made my way to the bed. He laid down on one side, and I settled on the other, making sure to keep as much distance as possible. My back was to him, and I prayed that sleep would come quickly, though I doubted it would.

Just as I was starting to relax, I heard the sound of pillows being moved. I glanced over my shoulder to see him placing a row of pillows between us.

‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt kick in your sleep,‚Äù he muttered, his tone dry.

Heat rushed to my face. ""I don‚Äôt think I do,"" I mumbled, though I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure.

The night passed in tense silence, but at some point, I must have drifted off. A sudden groan woke me, and I blinked groggily, trying to figure out what had happened. My heart sank when I realized that, in my sleep, I had somehow managed to kick Sorin in the chest.

‚ÄúOh my God, I‚Äôm so sorry!‚Äù I gasped, covering my mouth in horror.

He glared at me, jaw clenched, clearly in pain. He shoved my leg back over to my side of the bed and got up without a word, heading straight for the bathroom.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I called out again, desperate for some form of forgiveness. ‚ÄúDoes it hurt a lot?‚Äù

He ignored me, his face a mask of irritation as he disappeared into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. A tear slid down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Crying wouldn‚Äôt help. Nothing would.

https://preview.redd.it/05o6ut7jvoud1.jpg?width=1001&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8fbf373c86824943f64d8db87a427cf23cb82ee

I decided to make breakfast, hoping maybe it would soften the edges between us. By the time I finished, I heard him coming down the stairs, impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit. He looked just as handsome as ever, but he walked past the kitchen without a glance in my direction.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ breakfast?‚Äù I stammered, trying to gather the courage to speak.

He paused for a fraction of a second, then continued walking toward the front door. Without so much as a word, he left, slamming the door behind him.

I stared at the untouched plates in front of me, my heart sinking further. I sat down at the table and forced myself to eat, though every bite tasted like ash. The lump in my throat grew with each passing second as the reality of my situation settled in.

Sorin would never love me. I was nothing more than an inconvenience to him, a burden he‚Äôd been forced to bear. My heart longed for something, someone to care about me, but all I had was emptiness.

Tears welled up again, but this time, I didn‚Äôt bother to fight them back. No one would see. No one cared.

I just wanted to be loved.

Let‚Äôs get started with our checklist!

# The Ultimate Morning Routine Checklist

To build a morning routine that fuels success, consider these essential habits. They‚Äôre designed to help you start each day with intention, energy, and clarity.

**Mindfulness and Setting Intentions**

Starting with mindfulness can set a calm and focused tone for the day. Practicing even a few minutes of meditation or deep breathing exercises helps clear mental clutter and cultivates inner peace, which is especially beneficial for entrepreneurs facing daily demands and high-stakes decisions.¬†

After mindfulness exercises, take a few moments to set clear intentions for the day. Reflect on your priorities and identify one or two key goals to focus on. By aligning your actions with your broader vision, you can stay focused on what matters most, minimizing distractions and decision fatigue.

# Physical Activity

Physical activity in the morning is a powerful energizer and mood booster, making it a valuable addition to anyone‚Äôs routine.¬†

Whether it‚Äôs a brisk walk, a quick workout, or a few minutes of stretching or yoga, moving your body releases endorphins, enhances blood flow, and prepares both your mind and body for the tasks ahead.¬†

Regular physical activity also builds resilience, helping you maintain stamina and mental clarity during long workdays. Remember, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a full workout‚Äîjust a few minutes of movement can make a noticeable difference in your energy levels and focus.

# Hydration and Nutritious Breakfast

Starting your day hydrated and well-nourished can have a profound impact on your energy, focus, and overall health.¬†

Drinking a glass of water upon waking helps replenish fluids lost overnight and kickstarts your metabolism. Following hydration with a nutritious breakfast provides the fuel your brain and body need to operate at their best.¬†

Aim for foods that offer a balanced mix of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates, such as oatmeal with nuts, eggs and avocado, or a smoothie with fruits and greens. These options help sustain your energy and focus through the morning, setting a productive tone for the hours ahead.

Consider a[ multi-vitamin or other health supplements](https://livegood.com/multivitaminForMen/launchnow?SOURCE=rdtmorning) as an insurance policy that your body gets the nutritional support that you need for your day. This should not be an alternative to eating a healthy breakfast, but a ‚Äòsupplement‚Äô to healthy eating habits.

# Reviewing Daily and Weekly Goals

Taking a few minutes to review your daily and weekly goals keeps your actions aligned with your larger vision. Start by identifying your top priorities for the day‚Äîtasks that will move your business forward or help you reach your long-term objectives.¬†

Time-blocking, or dedicating specific periods to specific tasks, can be especially helpful here, as it reduces the likelihood of distraction and helps maintain a steady workflow. By reviewing your goals each morning, you can approach your day with clarity and purpose, knowing exactly where to direct your time and energy for maximum impact.

# Staying on Task with a Morning Routine App

In a busy world filled with distractions, a[ morning routine app can be a game-changer](https://freedomrep.com/whats-your-morning-routine) for busy folks looking to stick to their morning habits and maintain focus.¬†

Routine apps provide structure and reminders, ensuring that you don‚Äôt miss any essential steps in your routine. With features like timed tasks, progress tracking, and customizable notifications, these apps help you stay on track and accountable, even on the busiest mornings.

Apps like *Habitify*, [*What‚Äôs Your Morning Routine App*](https://freedomrep.com/whats-your-morning-routine), or *Productive* allow you to set up a tailored sequence of habits, giving you gentle reminders as you complete each task.¬†

For example, if your routine includes meditation, exercise, and a goal review, the app can guide you from one activity to the next, making it easier to stay in flow without getting sidetracked by emails, social media, or other distractions.

Additionally, tracking your routine over time offers valuable insights. You can see trends, like which habits you‚Äôre more consistent with, and where you might need to make adjustments.¬†

This data helps you refine your morning routine, ensuring it remains effective and motivating. With a routine app, you not only create a reliable structure but also build momentum, keeping your mornings productive and empowering you to start each day with purpose.

[**Click here to get started with ‚Äú*****What‚Äôs Your Morning Routine*****‚Äù app (free).**](https://freedomrep.com/whats-your-morning-routine)

# Journaling or Self-Reflection

Taking a few moments each morning for [journaling](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentID=4552&ContentTypeID=1#:~:text=It's%20simply%20writing%20down%20your,and%20improve%20your%20mental%20health) or self-reflection can help clear your mind, spark creativity, and provide a sense of mental clarity that lasts throughout the day.¬†

Journaling can be a powerful tool for capturing new ideas, processing challenges, and reflecting on wins and lessons from previous days. Start with a simple prompt‚Äîlike ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my main focus today?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat am I grateful for?‚Äù‚Äîand let your thoughts flow naturally.¬†

This exercise can also serve as a creative outlet, allowing you to brainstorm solutions or note down ideas for your family, work, or business.

Self-reflection in the morning also helps reinforce a growth mindset, essential for tackling the obstacles and learning opportunities that come your way in life...¬†

By dedicating just a few minutes to this practice, you can cultivate a positive mindset, reinforce your goals, and set a resilient tone for the day ahead.

# Learning and Growth

One of the most productive habits you can cultivate is a commitment to lifelong learning. Mornings are an ideal time for brief study sessions, whether that‚Äôs reading a few pages of a business book, listening to an educational podcast, or catching up on industry news.¬†

These moments of learning can provide fresh perspectives, inspire new ideas, and help you stay sharp in your field.

Setting aside time each morning to engage with new knowledge also helps build the mental discipline needed to innovate and adapt in today‚Äôs fast-changing world.¬†

The key is to choose content that enriches your understanding and aligns with your goals, whether it‚Äôs sharpening a skill, gaining insight into market trends, or exploring personal development topics.¬†

By dedicating a few minutes each morning to learning, you invest in yourself and your business, preparing for both current and future challenges.

Note: When you download the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Your Morning Routine‚Äù app, you also get free access to a library of self-development content through the Secrets of Success Mastermind and community.

# Additional Tips for Customizing a Morning Routine

While a structured morning routine can be life-changing, it‚Äôs essential to adapt it to your lifestyle and preferences to keep it sustainable and enjoyable. Here are some tips to personalize your routine so it works for you:

# Adapt to Your Energy Levels

Everyone has a unique rhythm, and your routine should respect that. Some people feel energized first thing in the morning, while others take a bit more time to get going.¬†

Adjust the intensity of your morning activities based on your natural energy levels. For instance, if you‚Äôre not a morning person, start with calming habits like journaling or meditation before diving into goal-setting or exercise.

# Incorporate Flexibility for Busy Days

Life often means dealing with unexpected challenges and a fluctuating schedule. To keep your routine resilient, allow some flexibility.¬†

Designate a few non-negotiable habits, like hydration or a quick review of your goals, but feel free to swap or skip non-essential tasks when needed. By staying flexible, you avoid burnout and make your routine adaptable to life‚Äôs demands.

# Create an Enjoyable Environment

Setting up a morning environment you look forward to can make your routine more enjoyable and consistent. Use scents, music, or lighting that energizes or soothes you, depending on your preference.¬†

Consider setting up a dedicated space for your morning habits‚Äîlike a meditation nook or a reading corner‚Äîto make the experience feel more intentional and rewarding.

# Make It Manageable

When building a morning routine, it‚Äôs easy to feel ambitious and stack too many activities, only to end up feeling overwhelmed.¬†

Start with a few essential habits, and gradually add more if desired. By keeping the routine manageable, you‚Äôre more likely to stick with it long-term, gradually creating a series of habits that enrich your day without overloading your schedule.

Free tools like the[ ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Your Morning Routine‚Äù app can help](https://freedomrep.com/whats-your-morning-routine) with managing your morning routine checklist.

# Common Pitfalls to Avoid

As beneficial as morning routines are, there are a few traps that can derail your best intentions. Here are some common pitfalls entrepreneurs should watch out for:

# 1. Starting the Day with Digital Distractions

One of the biggest productivity killers is reaching for your phone or checking emails and social media as soon as you wake up.¬†

These distractions can clutter your mind, pull you into reactive mode, and steal precious time from more meaningful activities. Instead, consider keeping your phone on ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù until after you‚Äôve completed your routine.¬†

Use your morning to center yourself first, giving you more control and focus as you enter the workday.

# 2. Overloading Your Routine with Too Many Habits

It‚Äôs easy to feel inspired by different habits and try to incorporate them all at once. But when a routine becomes overloaded, it can feel exhausting rather than energizing.¬†

Start small, with a few core habits that truly matter to you. Gradually build from there, adding one habit at a time as they become natural parts of your day.

# 3. Being Too Rigid or Inflexible

While consistency is essential, overly rigid routines can lead to frustration, especially when the unexpected happens. A successful daily routine requires flexibility, so remember that it‚Äôs okay to adjust or even skip parts of your routine on busy days.¬†

Allow your routine to work with your schedule, not against it, so it serves as a supportive tool rather than an added stressor.

[Click here to set up your morning routine checklist today.¬†](https://freedomrep.com/whats-your-morning-routine)

# 4. Neglecting Self-Care in Favor of Productivity

While it‚Äôs natural to focus on productive habits, be mindful not to overlook[ self-care](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/caring-for-your-mental-health) activities. Restorative practices like mindfulness, meditation, and journaling may not seem as directly productive as goal-setting or task management, but they play a crucial role in maintaining your mental and emotional well-being.¬†

A balanced routine that includes self-care is ultimately more sustainable and beneficial for both personal and professional growth.

# 5. Ignoring Your Natural Preferences and Rhythm

Your morning routine should feel natural and enjoyable, not forced. If a particular habit isn‚Äôt working for you, don‚Äôt be afraid to adapt or replace it with something more effective.¬†

Whether that means switching up your exercise routine, changing your learning format (like podcasts instead of reading), or adjusting your wake-up time, align your routine with what feels right for you. This way, your mornings become a time you look forward to rather than a set of tasks you feel compelled to complete.

# Building a Routine That Drives Success

Creating a morning routine that aligns with your goals and preferences can be a powerful tool for building momentum, focus, and productivity in life....¬†

By starting each day with intention and structuring your morning to include habits that nourish both your mind and body, you set the foundation for a productive and balanced workday.¬†

I have mainly 220v sockets.

I would have room for a row of 6 portrait panels or 2 rows of 4 landscape panels (if thats possible).  
I will not be delivering back to the grid. It would be to lower my electricity bill.  
During the day i have a pool pump running (\~1000W) for 8 hours and an AC (\~500W) and would try to also run the dishwasher and a washing machine during the day. Also other appliances would run (some occasionally), like fridge, fans, coffee machine, PC etc but they don't consume that much.  
Anyone knowledgeable out here who could recommend me what Wp panels and what make and model inverter (1phase or 3 phase and for how much Kw)? I'm hoping to do most of the installation myself.

1gh7zm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gh7zm0/my_m24_girlfriend_f23_got_mad_at_me_for_going_out/,My (m24) girlfriend (f23) got mad at me for going out to dinner with my girl best friend (f24). What's the best action?,"I've been dating my girlfriend for 2 months, we've known each other for 4. I've been friends with my friend for 10 years, and in thise 10 years our relationship has been strictly platonic, no funny business at all.

In the beginning of the week my plans for Halloween were either dinner with classmates, a party with highschool friends, or hang out with my girl best friend. I told my girlfriend about these different options. My initial choice was to go to dinner with my classmates, and my girlfriend was invited to said dinner. She said she'll check her plans and she'll come if nothing came up for her. Her friends invited her out to hang out, so she was going to spend the night with them.

Fast forward to Halloween day, the dinner plans with my classmates fall through so I figure I'll just stay home instead. My best friend told me that morning that she no longer had plans. So, my girlfriend heads over to her friends' house. I stay home for a couple hours, texting my girlfriend, doing gomework. Then my girl best friend texts me that she's going to dinner by herself and I'm welcomed to join.

For context, I've mentioned my bestfriend plenty of times before to my girlfriend. My bestfriend and I have gone to the coffee shop plenty of times together, we've gone out drinking together. And my girlfriend was invited to each of those hangouts because my bestfriend wants her to see that we're strictly platonic. Whenever I talked about my bestfriend, my girlfriend would start to give me one word text replies, which obviously I caught. And everytime I would ask her if hanging out with my bestfriend ever rubbed her the wrong way. Which she would always reply no since she said she trusts me

Dinner last night was the tipping point. She was giving me one word answers to everything last night and I asked her what was wrong in which she would tell me nothing was wrong. I communicated with her everything that my best friend and I did as it happened, still one word replies. Eventually she started texting me things like, ""go be with her"". So she was obviously upset. I drive home and text her straight up ""What's wrong""

She finally tells me that me and my best friend going out for dinner does rub her the wrong way. I thank her for sharing that with me and I tell her that we need to have this conversation to establish boundaries. But she just replies the same thing over and over to anything I say, ""it's whatever, do whatever you want"". 

I reassure her that the way she feels is valid and that I want to hear what she has to say, because as my girlfriend I don't want to do things that she's not comfortable with. We go back and forth of her giving me one word responses and making asking her to talk to me. Which I admit was selfish on my part, I was forcing her to have this conversation even if she didn't want to. I apologized to her for that. Eventually she asks me how I'd feel if she went out with her boy friends the way I went out with my girl friend. I tell her that initially I'd feel insecure and anxious, but at the end of the day I trust her. This makes her more mad.

I tell her that I understand where she's coming from. I tell that I'd feel insecure, I'd feel anxious, I'd feel betrayed. But come on, the way she views her best friends is the same way I view my best friend. She tells me that she's upset that me and my bestfriend text each other every week. She's upset that every girl has the same access to me that she does. She's upset that we got dinner together.

We were supposed to go to a concert the next day (Today), but she angrily tells me to take my best friend instead. She woke up this morning asking if we're still going. I tell her that I would like her to come with, but I understand if she doesnt't want to either. I apologize to her again, and she continues to reply with one word replies ""ok"". I ask her if she still likes me despite last night and she says yes. I ask her if there was anything she wanted to talk about, which she replies no. She asks me if there's anything I wanted to talk about, and asks what do I want from her. 

I tell her that there's nothing I could ask from her. I want to know how to make things right but also recognize that I can't force things to be right between us, so I feel powerless in a sense.

I bought mine in Seattle in 2007. I was on the fence about throwing down the money when a woman walked in the shop I was at, cradling a very old, battered Europiccola in for servicing. I stopped her cold and asked, ""Do you like it?"" She looked at me with a serious look on her face and said. ""I love it. It's my baby."" 

So I bought mine right then and there. Now I have, in a sense, become that lady.

I've sent it out for regular servicing to certified repair shops. Most recently in Holland having the heating coil/electrical upgraded to 230v. But this time when it started weeping from the group head, I decided to try servicing it myself. And I have to say, it's been so rewarding. Seeing every part, and how it all fits together like a pistol has been very satisfying. As you can see by my photo, my whole kitchen became my work bench. Some tools were makeshift. (A wire stripper can double as a spanner wrench in a pinch. Looking at you plastic piston sleeve.) But I did it. Disassembled most of it and cleaned it top to bottom. Replaced seals/gaskets and will be replacing a few broken parts. New site glass cover along with a boiler pipe/boiler insert combo that disintegrated when removed.

Lastly, it's also cool seeing the resurgence of interest in these machines. When I saw one in action the first time, in 1992, it was basically a relic. When I bought mine, 15 years later, it was an oddity. The community was small. Seeing so many companies and owners improving on the design and exploring what this simple, expandable design can do is really, really fun. 

So, to many more years of great coffee. And tinkering. (Coffee Sensor's web site is DANGEROUS.) 

First photo is today, last photo is when I first brought it home.

Everything started last year September when I got severe diarrhea , I took Imodium and two days after I was fine , until the middle of September where I started having first globus sensation , a clicking throat sound and then ,shortness of breath , to the point that I can‚Äôt run . I went to the doctor, blood work showed nothing except low vitamin D my heart was fine my chest x ray fine too , my spirometry was at 81 FEV/FEV1 and I remember that day that I wasn‚Äôt able to fill fully my lungs because I was feeling something like a blockage in the middle of my esophagus, fast forward in this summer I started having loose and yellowish stools and on my very bad days diarrhea.
 I gave up coffee some days ago but I don‚Äôt see something that have changed and now I‚Äôm trying to cut nicotine too with some pouches .
I just want to feel normal again and do the stuff 19 yo do, im afraid to drink and eat and the last few days im trying to starve myself because some of the symptoms, some , seem to go away when I‚Äôm empty

And sorry in advance if I'm rambly/not making a ton of sense; still haven't had my morning coffee.

I just started a paid individual plan, and have been working on migrating my various Gmail accounts and consolidating all of them into Fastmail. So far the process has been fairly smooth, but all of the accounts I've dealt with so far have been relatively simple (newer accounts with fewer emails and very little in terms of labels). Importantly, I'm choosing to use Fastmail's folders instead of labels for now for organizational purposes (though I'm kinda wish I could use both, lol).

The last account I need to migrate is a bit of a doozy. It's my first Gmail account from like 2007, and over the years it's become extremely convoluted, between forwards/fetches set up from various other accounts, a mess of labels criss-crossing everywhere, and there being over 200,000 emails in total. I trust that the import itself should be smooth enough, but I know that this is gonna be a project and a half to organize and I need a sanity check and some guidance to make sure I'm going about this in a way that makes sense. So far I've been just running migrations, doing a search for ""to:<gmail address>"", and manually going through everything to organize/delete things accordingly.

My first thought is if there's some way to isolate a migrated mailbox that would be super helpful, like if I could pull everything from this account into subfolders of some ""Imported"" folder so I don't have thousands of archived emails mixed in the top-level Archive before I can sort through them. If that's not possible, is there anything else that might make this easier? Secondly I want to do my best to cut down on duplicated emails (if there's some way to find emails that exist in multiple labels/folders that would be ideal). Because this particular mailbox is so old there's emails that are ""to"" countless addresses that I had forwarded, and I know I'm gonna miss stuff if I don't start with things as clean as possible.

So...

I hope people here remember the post I made about a week and a half ago regarding the idea for a tart with hazelnut praline, coffee sponge, corn pastry cream, and vanilla ganache.

Well, I made it! I roasted the corn in the oven with butter to enhance its nutty flavors and infused it into the milk for the pastry cream. For the ""coffee sponge,"" I prepared an almond jaconde that I soaked in espresso.

All week, my family kept saying, ""Sounds nice; hope the corn works. It might be weird in flavor,"" etc. I understood their hesitation about tasting corn in a tart, but today, when we tasted it, it was truly delicious! The pastry cream is excellent, the corn flavor is noticeable and tasty, and everything came together beautifully in the mouth.

Comment:
I would have liked a stronger coffee flavor; it was noticeable but gentle. Maybe I should soak the jaconde instead of just spreading it, or incorporate coffee into something else.

# What Years Are Considered Mid-Century Modern?

Mid-century modern furniture generally refers to pieces made between the mid-1940s and the late 1960s. This was a time when the world was changing after World War II. Families wanted their homes to feel fresh and welcoming, so they needed furniture that was not only practical but also stylish. This led to the rise of mid-century modern design, a style that people still love today.

# How Did This Style Come About?

Mid-century modern furniture didn‚Äôt just pop up out of nowhere. It was influenced by earlier design movements that focused on simplicity and usefulness. Designers like Charles and Ray Eames, George Nelson, and Eero Saarinen weren‚Äôt just creating furniture; they were shaping a new way of living. They used materials like molded plastic and plywood to create affordable pieces that looked fun and modern.

# What Makes Mid-Century Modern Furniture Unique?

What are the standout features of mid-century modern furniture? Here are some things that make it special:

* **Clean Lines**: This style is all about simple shapes and smooth forms. You‚Äôll find furniture with minimal designs that look modern and tidy.
* **Soft Curves**: Many pieces have gentle curves that make them inviting. Imagine chairs that look great and feel comfortable to sit in.
* **Mix of Materials**: Designers loved combining different materials. You‚Äôll see wood mixed with metals and glass, creating unique pieces that catch the eye. For instance, a genuine leather couch can look fantastic alongside metal accents.
* **Functional Design**: Every piece has a purpose. Designers wanted to make furniture that is not just pretty but also practical. Think about a leather modern couch or a coffee table that offers extra storage.
* **Bold Colors and Patterns**: While natural wood tones are common, bright colors and fun patterns are also important. Adding some colorful cushions or wall art can give your space a lively touch.

1gh6zq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1gh6zq1/as_a_person_diagnosed_with_obsessive_compulsive/,"As a person diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, what Vivian described was not OCD","I am so frustrated with people using actual mental disorders and problems as a fancy victim card. Not saying Vivian is doing that , since we ‚Äúhave‚Äù to consider what he‚Äôs saying is true. 

But someone touching your coffee mug and that irking you is NOT OCD ! A person with OCD will be placing their coffee mug at not so easy to reach places from others and would have them at the same place everytime .

A person with OCD deals with a lot of uncertainty in their head. We are not ‚Äúorganized‚Äù or ‚Äúclean‚Äù because of OCD . We can be just as messy or unhygienic (which Vivian clearly is). Whatever it is, WE ARE EXTREMELY HUMBLE AND NICE ABOUT THINGS AND ARE ACTUALLY VERY APOLOGETIC ABOUT OUT TICKs. We don‚Äôt use our tics to be shitty and certainly don‚Äôt boast our tics . We understand that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmy problem‚Äù thing and I have to deal with it. 

What we however do is, due to the fear of contamination or losing control, will try to keep things in check/ hidden. 

For example , I keep my water glass inside a plastic box both of which I clean everyday. Keeping a water glass inside the box is not a very organized way of doing it, the water also spills inside the box and could make it unhygienic. But to my head it somehow makes me feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs worked so far. 

I also have major tics about symmetry and counting. Like everything has to be counted or I will start and stop tasks exactly when the seconds clock hits 6 . Again, these make me late sometimes and not very organized, but it‚Äôs what‚Äôs make me feel in control. 

I also pray everyday to sometimes I don‚Äôt know whom? For things I cannot control, I need an overlord to have some ‚Äúplan‚Äù or control. 

Vivian may or may not have OCD, but that behaviour isn‚Äôt justified by OCD. That honestly sounded like ‚Äúoh I have OCD so that‚Äôs My excuse to be shitty to you‚Äù",46,1730472085.0,biggboss,26,0.83,False

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

¬†

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn‚Äôt say anything.

¬†

I needed a job‚Äîsomething to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a caf√© just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

¬†

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

¬†

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the caf√©: Love & Coffee.

¬†

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The caf√©‚Äôs simple elegance, with its white and brown d√©cor, felt inviting.

¬†

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù I stammered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?‚Äù

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre looking for a job?‚Äù His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. ‚ÄúI really need one. I don‚Äôt have much experience, but I‚Äôm a fast learner and willing to do anything.‚Äù

1gh6y3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1gh6y3n/recommendation_for_a_strong_tea_for_the_office/,Recommendation for a strong tea for the office,"tl;dr: I am looking for recommendations for strong-tasting, high-caffeine tea to make throughout the day at the office.


  
Every so often I switch between tea and coffee at the office, and the pendulum is about to swing back to tea. The last time I was on a big tea kick, it was Yorkshire Gold. I enjoyed it plenty, but was hoping to branch out a little. I typically enjoy strong and odd flavors, and I do like puerh and lapsang souchong. I'd also prefer anything that can be made with extra fuss or equipment. The reason I'm tired of coffee is having to futz around with a aeropress (or similar device) multiple times a day. And the last thing I'll say that I'm sure will get me dragged here, but... when I make tea, the bag or leaves stay in the brew until I'm done drinking the cup. I'm not changing that. Sorry!

1gh6w6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/comments/1gh6w6g/navigating_gear_and_developing_as_a_player/,Navigating gear and developing as a player,"In my 30s, I jumped back into playing guitar and piano after years of playing very little. I wanted to explore all the fun gear and stuff that I didn‚Äôt have money or a head for when I was younger. The trouble for me was navigating the HUGE mass of gear out there, as well as the tons of terms, techniques, and theory required to make sense of it all.



Without a systematic way to approach things, I caught a major case of GAS, then paralysis from all the options, then no sense of a target or path to get there. But slowly thinking through ways to approach it all has been really helpful in alleviating GAS, honing in on what‚Äôs important, and piecing together a path to somewhere. I just want to share my evolving approach and learn how others have dealt with similar problems.



Here‚Äôs been my approach. Organize everything playing-related‚Äìsong lists, gear, thoughts about gear, functions, goals‚Äìinto predetermined categories and then form connections across the categories.¬†



The three predetermined categories are ‚Äúwhy I‚Äôm playing,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat I‚Äôm playing,‚Äù and ‚Äúhow I‚Äôm playing it.‚Äù



**WHY**: Specify why you are playing a piece of music at all and the real-world role occupied to do so. I have two: ‚ÄúI want to be able to play live at bars and coffee shops with confidence and relative ease‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want to write, record, and release original songs somehow.‚Äù



**WHAT**: Specify what piece you are playing‚Äìa song, an opera, an original, a cover, a drum pattern, a lofi loop, whatever. For me, the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù is a long list of cover songs and a short list of originals.



**HOW**: Specify technical know-how required to play the songs specified in the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù category. I break this category up into ‚Äúgenerators‚Äù (i.e., the instruments generating sound and the techniques for playing them), time-shifters (i.e., rhythmic effects), and tone shifters (i.e., distortion, dynamics, and harmonics).¬†



Then I then pick one thing from each category, link them together in a why-what-how chain, and execute. For example, if I‚Äôm hot to play a song I heard on the radio (the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù), I put it alongside a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù to see if it makes sense to devote time to it. If the song is something I would play out live, then I add it to list and start working on the ‚Äúhow.‚Äù But if it‚Äôs not something that would fit in a live setting, then I set it aside and pick another why-what-how chain to work on.



Since starting this process, I have found that my GAS is way down (I have less gear now than when I started). And I now have a method for choosing what to focus on‚Äìand maybe more importantly, what not to focus on. The net effect is that I‚Äôm playing better live and having more fun.



I don‚Äôt know, maybe it‚Äôs too formal and will eventually squeeze out the fun? Have other amateurs worked out a useful system for navigating all this stuff?

1gh6uhk,https://i.redd.it/4vhbg0mswayd1.png,Meta AI has made new tools that will enable robots to touch and feel like humans,"Meta's AI research team, known as FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), is pushing robotics forward with new tools that focus on giving robots the ability to ""feel,"" move with skill, and work alongside people. These advancements are aimed at creating robots that are not only technically capable but can also handle real-world tasks in a way that feels natural and safe around humans. Here‚Äôs an easy breakdown of what they‚Äôve announced and why it matters.

Imagine the everyday tasks humans do: picking up a cup of coffee, stacking dishes, or even shaking hands. These all require a sense of touch and careful control that humans take for granted. Robots, however, don‚Äôt naturally have these abilities. They usually rely on vision or programmed instructions, making it tough for them to handle delicate objects, understand textures, or adapt to changes on the spot.

Meta‚Äôs latest tools help robots overcome these limitations. By giving robots a sense of ‚Äútouch‚Äù through advanced sensors and systems, these tools could make it possible for robots to perform tasks with the same sensitivity and adaptability that humans use. This could open up a world of possibilities for robots in fields like healthcare, manufacturing, and even virtual reality.

Meta has released three new technologies to enhance robot touch, movement, and collaboration with humans:

1. Meta Sparsh:      Sparsh is a touch-sensing technology that helps AI recognise textures, pressure, and even movement through touch, not just sight. Unlike many AI systems that need labeled data for each task, Sparsh uses raw data, making it more adaptable and accurate across various tasks.

2. Meta Digit 360:      Digit 360 is an advanced artificial fingertip with human-level touch sensitivity. It can sense tiny differences in texture and detect very small forces, capturing touch details similar to a human finger. It‚Äôs built with a powerful lens that covers the whole fingertip, letting it ‚Äúsee‚Äù in all directions, and it can even react to different temperatures. 

3. Meta Digit Plexus:      Plexus is a system that connects multiple touch sensors across a robotic hand, giving it a sense of touch from fingertips to palm. 

Meta isn‚Äôt developing these tools alone. They‚Äôve partnered with two companies, GelSight Inc. and Wonik Robotics, to manufacture and distribute these touch-sensing tools:

- GelSight Inc. will produce and distribute the Digit 360 fingertip sensor. Researchers can apply to get early access and explore new uses for this technology in fields like healthcare, robotics, and more.    - Wonik Robotics will integrate the Plexus technology into their existing robotic hand model, Allegro Hand, enhancing its touch capabilities and making it available for researchers who want to study or build on this technology.

These partnerships help ensure that researchers and developers worldwide have access to these cutting-edge tools, allowing them to explore and expand on Meta‚Äôs work in touch perception and robot dexterity.

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the caf√© began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn‚Äôt even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration‚Äîone I hadn‚Äôt heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

‚ÄúDrea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought‚Äî""

‚ÄúMessed up?‚Äù I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I‚Äôm so sorry, Drea. I promise, I‚Äôm not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren‚Äôt alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. ‚ÄúOh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids‚ÄîIsla and Josh.‚Äù

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? ‚ÄúOh... hi,‚Äù I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Isla‚Äôs third birthday today,‚Äù Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

‚ÄúHappy Birthday, Isla,‚Äù I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla‚Äôs face lit up. ‚ÄúThank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!‚Äù

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. ‚ÄúYes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.‚Äù

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch up with you later, Adrian,‚Äù I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian‚Äôs family lingering for Isla‚Äôs birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the caf√© and mentally kicked myself. I‚Äôd forgotten to get Adrian‚Äôs number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn‚Äôt managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

‚ÄúDrea,‚Äù a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. ‚ÄúI was just coming to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdrian?‚Äù I blinked, surprised. ‚ÄúI thought you left hours ago.‚Äù

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. ‚ÄúI did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.‚Äù

I nodded, my heart pounding. ‚ÄúYeah, we do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to take a walk?‚Äù

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn‚Äôt want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Adrian‚Äôs voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. ‚ÄúYou got married.‚Äù

I shot him a sideways glance. ‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? It was all over the news. Didn‚Äôt you see it?‚Äù

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù

He laughed softly, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You‚Äôve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.‚Äù

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn‚Äôt lie to him. Not after everything we‚Äôd been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real, Adrian.‚Äù

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a business deal,‚Äù I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. ‚ÄúMy parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.‚Äù

Adrian‚Äôs expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. ‚ÄúDrea‚Ä¶‚Äù

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, Adrian. I am. I‚Äôve learned to deal with it.‚Äù

His jaw clenched. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn‚Äôt have let this happen.‚Äù

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault. You couldn‚Äôt have known.‚Äù

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn‚Äôt work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing out here?‚Äù

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed‚Äîthough I couldn‚Äôt quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just come inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe door‚Ä¶ it wouldn‚Äôt open,‚Äù I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. ‚ÄúDid you try using your fingerprint?‚Äù

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. ‚ÄúUnbelievable. Now we‚Äôre locked out.‚Äù He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn‚Äôt help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he‚Äôd let me in‚Äîboth literally and figuratively.

In the last 2 months, the thickness of my hair has been literally cut in half. When I shower, I lose SO much hair. I am to the point I don't want to shower because its scary (don't worry, I still shower). All of my bloodwork came back normal, including my thyroid. My calcium levels were the only ones that were slightly elevated.

Right now, I am doing the following: taking collagen peptides daily in my coffee, natural rosemary oil spray nightly, washing with a biotin and collagen shampoo, taking a biotin/collagen keratin supplement daily, multivitamin daily, and I get about 80g of protein daily. I eat a lot of dates, pumpkin seeds, almonds. Lots of water.

Please tell me this is going to stop? It is really freaking me out. I really don't want to take minoxidil (esp not doing topical because we have a cat). I have only been taking the biotin supplement for a week, been on the collagen peptides for a month. How long do I let this go on before I really start to panic?!? Does Nutrafol work??

Right now I work a cleaner job, mainly washing dishes in a coffee shop. This job is relatively demanding physically, so I eat a lot of meat to sustain myself. However, I'm constantly finding myself gravitating towards a sattvic diet, unhappy with eating meat, trying to eat as little as possible. This being said, I'm usually very hungry without meat, so I feel kind of trapped between the two ways of eating. Is it possible for a person to stay healthy, satiated and preferably strong while eating in a yogic way?

Hello all, 

Another week, another shot! 

I am recently divorced. I work a lot. I‚Äôm an introverted extrovert. I have a beard and tattoos. I‚Äôm rough on the edges. I swear a lot. Looking to connect with somebody who‚Äôs serious about getting to know one another who values trust honesty, and communication and is super kind to others. I am attracted to all races, creeds, religions and nationalities. I do prefer woman who have curves. I‚Äôm also an ass man so bonus points if you‚Äôre a cutie with a bootie. I know I know, super cheesy. But that‚Äôs me. I have a fairly stable life. I drive, have my own place, have my shit together. I don‚Äôt smoke, drink or do drugs but I‚Äôm not against people who do. If your weekends are all about going out, drinking and shit like that, it probably ain‚Äôt going to work. 
A bit more about me below ‚¨áÔ∏è 

* 41, Caucasian, 6‚Äô1
* Super chill & friendly 
* Best smelling guy you‚Äôll meet. Period. 
* I‚Äôm a Dad of 2 beautiful kids.

* Lover of Coffee
* Nature walks & Hikes are my jam. I love to throw on my AirPods, find a trail and just go. 

Can send a SFW pic if you are willing too also! Hoping to connect with you! 

Lastly, I know what I want & I know what I‚Äôm ready for. I‚Äôm getting tired of people telling ME that I‚Äôm not ready for something. The only person who can truly know that is myself.

A few days ago, I was running on 5 hours of sleep and feeling really off. I had a cup of coffee and was more alert, energetic, and positive than on days when I get 8 hours of sleep. The effect lasts for around 8-10 hours. 

Is caffeine as a drug just that *good* at optimizing energy levels during the day? Or is it possible to get that kind of high quality energy naturally?

English is not my first language, sorry if I make mistakes. This is not the first time. I think is not normal for couples to be upset and separated for a holiday after a huge fight. Maybe once‚Ä¶ but I feel like at least once a year this happens.

I was yesterday with him in a concert I gifted him for his birthday. Very special: VIP tickets with a meet and greet and signed items of his favorite band. We decided to travel to a city we‚Äôve never been before to make the experience even cooler.

We‚Äôre at the concert and he‚Äôs talking about how he feels about his body and getting old. I feel like he‚Äôs struggling a bit with his self image lately and he‚Äôs a bit harsh on himself so I try to hype him up. Then he comments on how I have a muffing top like him. I get upset because honestly I weight 105lbs and of course I could be slimmer and stronger but telling me I have a muffing top?! Honestly man! He apologizes and tells me I‚Äôm beautiful and I let it go. The concert starts and he‚Äôs having fun. I don‚Äôt love this band but I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs happy, I‚Äôm dancing but staying in a part I feel comfortable while he goes to the mosh pit. Then a song I really like starts and I tell him: ‚Äòthis is the best song ever‚Äô and dance and I should have known something was up with him because he responds: ‚Äòare you being sarcastic?‚Äô And I‚Äôm very confused and say that no, that I love it. And he also comes to me a couple times to ask if I‚Äôm still angry (I told him that everything is fine and kiss him back).

So after the concert ends he‚Äôs furious with me. About how I ruined his night for a stupid comment he made and I‚Äôm honestly baffled because I felt fine? He starts talking about other times that I have done this and is a big problem. This has happened before at other concerts and it makes me feel terrible whenever he tells me I ruin everything because something made me feel sad. It makes me feel super anxious and guilty. I always feel very bad later. Like I ruin everything. The thing is this time‚Ä¶ I feel different about it. Like I should be able to feel whatever I do if I‚Äôm able to handle it like an adult. Process my feelings, and we could still enjoy the evening. He tells me I should not say anything to not ruin his special night and I should talk about it the next day. of course this is the best thing I could do but I don‚Äôt think how I reacted was anything too crazy‚Ä¶ I should have assured him more but at the same time I don‚Äôt think I was being moody or anything. I honestly felt fine. He days I‚Äôm lying and I hate it‚Ä¶ I know how I felt. I could have handled it better but I don‚Äôt think this deserves such a big reaction afterwards. I really feel sorry for making him feel bad in such a special night (I really tried to make a special birthday for him), and I know I can handle myself better and I should work on myself, but I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

He has grown a lot after years together, I love him very much but I‚Äôm exhausted. I used to feel so sad in these fights but know I‚Äôm just tired.

I have 43%.   First time I tried etching two blades, one damascus 1095/15n20 @ about 30 layers, and the other some random hard steel, and mid, san mai (First try at welding).

I'm not going crazy with finish, but, ground down all the hammering marks, so i think all the decarb is gone (is it ALWAYS present?), sanded down flat, and then finished with 200, 400, 1200 grits.  Still has marks, but....I'm fine with that.

So, etch in the 43% FC for 10min each....both just look matte gray.  The colors/layers don't pop like you see.   Why a matte finish!?!  Started off as pretty damn shiny!!  I can SEE the layers, but just barely.

Sanded back with the 1200, to re-shine, layers disappear.  Read up on it, and see I need to dilute (does FC only come in 40%??? how does one know how much to dilute?), so i did a 4:1ish.    The san mei turned BLACK and matte(10min)and the damascus was just dark, and matte again.

Whaaaat am I missing?  Should I not expect dark layer lines like I see on videos?  Do I just deal with the matte finish, and it'll wear down with use?  

ps: I know, i need to take more pics.   
pps: I did a coffee etch before I really finished the shape, just to see (also, before I had the FC), and the layers were REALLY dark!!!  But I read coffee etch doesn't last at all.

she follows me as i was doing it. and i was trying to pet her in short bursts as i was getting my coffee and breakfast together, but she keeps darting away downstairs. almost like she wants to show me something. but she keeps laying down on the floor and rolling around. in the same spot. 


she isn't spayed yet, i don't have enough money. so i'd imagine it has something to do with that, im hoping so.
