1k5twgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k5twgq/pump_does_not_stop_running_ecm_mechanika_iv_profi/,Pump does not stop running [ECM MECHANIKA IV PROFI],"Hello, I am having problems with my ECM Mechanika IV Profi. For the last two days, when I turned the machine on in the morning, the pump would not stop running, the pressure gauge would go up to 8/10 bar and the water level in the tank would not go down. After turning the machine on and off a few times and opening the brew group, it finally stopped and was able to make coffee normally. 

Today, the same behaviour, but when making coffee, the pressure gauge did not go up and stayed at 2/3 bar, then the boiler pressure went up to 3 bar, I heard some steam, probably from the safety valve, and I immediately checked if the boiler was overfilled, which it was, as water was coming out of the steam wand. I did a stronger backflush with Cafiza a couple of weeks ago as I hadn't done it for a few months, if that makes any difference. 

I could check the water probe but I'm pretty sure it's not scaled, I think the problem might be with the GICAR or the solenoid valve. What would you suggest for troubleshooting? Is there anything else I should check?",1,1745396068.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Friend gave me an old metal filter to try out that he had never used, and I went to use it earlier and it had coffee running through it considerably while filling up, even though it was ground fine enough for a paper filter (tried to do a side by side)

Are metal filters worth it as a saving/convenience? Might not always remember to refill my papers for my APGo, so want metal to work but is this my error, or the cheap knock off one? Should I get an official one?

Any thoughts/advice would be gratefully received! Thanks in advance",1,1745395820.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False
1k5ttwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/comments/1k5ttwe/looking_for_advice_and_feedback_on_my_name_change/,Looking for advice and feedback on my name change (I'm genderqueer but am thinking of taking a gendered name),"(Using a throwaway account because I might be giving too much identifiable info here, lol)

I am genderqueer and am looking to legally change my name. The name I'm thinking of using is **Felix**. 

**Why I like the name:** It's a name that I've loved ever since I was a kid. The meaning of ""lucky"" is very special to me. Friends have said that it really suits me. It matches my surname / heritage very well. Also, I love the nickname Flick (I know this sub thinks it's stupid, but it's just for close friends and family, so I don't see the harm in it 😅). Hearing people call me Felix literally fills me with joy like no name ever has before.

**The Issue(?):** Felix is quite a gendered name. I'm AFAB and don't plan on ever changing my gender legally (because having an X gender marker is not recognised everywhere and could even be dangerous in some places). I know that anyone who reads my name before seeing me will assume I'm a man.

On one hand, I worry that this will cause even more confusion than my gender and current name already cause... (my legal name is super femme and I look quite androgynous at this point).

On the other hand, I have made peace with the fact that I will never ""pass"" as genderqueer - as in, strangers will never gender me correctly. I use the name Alex at coffee shops and people will somehow mishear it as ""Alice"" if they read me as a woman. I know that I'm going to have to explain myself, no what what I do. (To be clear, I'm not correcting baristas, I mean like I will have to explain myself when I start a new job etc.).

On the other, other hand, part of me quite likes the idea of having this masc name while I am read more femme. It kind of suits how I feel about gender.

I'm just worried that I'm making a massive mistake somehow. **So, in short, do you think I'm making my life extra hard by choosing a gendered name? If you think it's a terrible idea, or have experience with this, please let me know.**

*(Ps. I'm not really looking for suggestions for other names, unless they have an ""ick"" or ""ix"" sound in them. I know Alex is a perfectly fine gender neutral name but I just don't like it on me.)*",1,1745395751.0,namenerds,0,1.0,False

I had a gift card in my wallet and decided to use it that day. After my wife and I were done looking at the menu, I went up to the cashier.

The cashier was a Russian lady with a thick accent, and I don't think she was in training. We told her our food and drink order, and I handed her the gift card. To my surprise, this turned out to be a problem. She took the card with a confused look.

She looked down at the card, bewildered, then back at me and said, ""What's this?""

A bit concerned, I replied, ""A gift card.""  
She responded, ""What's a gift card?""

So, I had to spend some time explaining to her what a gift card was. I don't think she could understand me that quite well, nor could I understand what she was saying either. She then called over what I assumed was a supervisor and handed the card to them, trying to figure out what it was. Both of them had no idea.

After a bit of them looking at me, then back at the card, and talking to each other, a teenage girl who was making coffee behind them stopped what she was doing, took the card from them, and proceeded to complete my order. She then started explaining to the two of them what a gift card was.

I'm honestly shocked this even happened. Gift cards are, I think, used pretty frequently. For an employee not in training, and especially a supervisor, to not know what a gift card is? That’s just weird and shocking.",1,1745395561.0,TimHortons,0,1.0,False

This often involves offering multiple variations of each crazy wing flavor, from ""mildly mad"" to ""insanely insane.""

Luke Munoz cheated.

Vespera Gildon stood outside the president's office, her body stiff as if encased in ice. Her black stilettos seemed to merge with the dark marble floor beneath her.

After a long pause, she finally raised her hand and knocked on the door.

A deep, familiar voice responded from inside. ""Come in.""

Vespera tightened her grip on the documents in her hand and pushed the door open with the other. As she stepped inside, she forced a faint smile onto her face and approached Luke.

""Are you busy? There are a few urgent documents that need your signature."" Even as Vespera asked, she had already placed the papers before him, flipping them open to the pages that required his signature.

Luke had just returned from a business trip to Shawford earlier that morning. He had come straight to the office to tackle the mountain of work waiting for him. His desk was cluttered with files, and his handsome, well-defined face bore traces of exhaustion.

Without even glancing at the documents, he signed them quickly. ""Thanks for your hard work.""

Vespera gathered the signed papers and asked, ""Will you be home for dinner tonight?""

""I have plans tonight. You don't need to wait for me,"" he replied without looking up.

""Okay. I'll head out then."" Vespera turned and walked away, clutching the documents. As she did, her smile faded into a cold, mocking expression.

As Vespera passed the restroom in the office, a faint sound reached her ears. It seemed like a small animal jumping off the bed and landing on the floor.

Her gaze swept over the couch area, where a few snack wrappers and a half-finished milk tea lay on the coffee table. On the floor, a pastel pink high heel lay tipped over.

Everything became clear instantly. Her heart turned cold, crumbling into ash.

Vespera returned to her office. The short walk back drained all her energy. When she finally sat down, she let out a long, weary sigh.

She pulled one document from the stack in her hands. It was a divorce agreement.

Flipping to the last page, Vespera traced the lines of his signature with a mocking expression, her mind flashing back to memories.

Luke vowed to marry Vespera back then. However, Vespera's mother-in-law warned her not to get too comfortable, as no man could stay loyal to one woman forever.

Vespera was naive enough to believe they were different. But what difference was there?

Luke had cheated on her with a young woman. He was convinced he was hiding it well, indulging in the thrill of his affair. He had even brought her along on his business trip to Shawford. And now, he had brought her back to the office.

Vespera withdrew her finger and snapped a photo of the signed divorce agreement. She then sent it to her mother-in-law, Fiona Reeds, with a simple message. ""He signed it.""

A week ago, Vespera had struck a deal with Fiona. She demanded that Vespera initiate the divorce and keep their secret marriage hidden from the public. In return, Vespera had asked for a billion-dollar settlement.

In a month, Luke would be completely out of her life.

Just then, a knock on the door interrupted her thoughts.

After keeping the divorce agreement, Vespera said, ""Please enter.""

The door opened, and Luke's assistant, Osbert Madron, stepped inside.

""Ms. Gildon, Mr. Munoz asked me to pass this to you,"" Osbert said, placing a dark green velvet box in front of her.

Vespera casually opened the box and found an expensive diamond jewelry set. But the first thing that flashed through her mind was a dazed, short-haired girl in a bathrobe, carelessly holding up a diamond necklace. The room bathed in dim, suggestive lighting, the bed rumpled, and the girl's chest marked with unmistakable love bites.

A wave of nausea churned in her stomach.

""Thank you, Mr. Madron.""

Osbert felt a chill run down his spine when he saw Verspera's threatening gaze. He couldn't help but add, ""Mr. Munoz personally selected this. It's one of a kind in the world.""

It's too bad that Luke's heart wasn't one of a kind; she no longer wanted it.

Vespera smiled faintly. ""Really? How touching that he found time in his busy schedule to buy me a gift.""

Something in her voice didn't quite align. Osbert's unease deepened as he broke into a cold sweat. Did she know about Luke and Tina Sowle? He mumbled an excuse and fled from the office.

Vespera looked at the jewelry on the desk with disdain, as if it were filthy. She took out her phone, snapped a photo, and sent it to the owner of a luxury resale shop.

Then, she instructed, ""Sell this for me and donate the proceeds to the Foundation for Children with Intellectual Disabilities.""

The resale shop owner was speechless.

…

At 5:00 pm, Vespera had just reached her car and was about to open the door when her gaze casually swept across the parking garage. She noticed a car idling diagonally across from her.

Through the window, she saw Luke in the backseat, a short-haired woman nestled close to him. The woman had a round, cute face and radiated youthful energy.

""Mr. Munoz!"" Osbert gasped, slamming on the brakes.

Separated by glass and a stretch of space, Vespera's eyes found Luke's.

Chapter 2

Luke's eyes were dark and unreadable, while Vespera's were lifeless, devoid of emotion.

The atmosphere in the garage was tense.

Despite noticing Verspera, the woman didn't bother to distance herself from Luke. Instead, she grew even bolder, wrapping her arms around his neck and whispering something into his ear.

Vespera felt disgusted by the scene. She looked away, got into her car, and drove off without glancing back.

…

Shortly after arriving home, Vespera heard the sound of another car pulling up outside.

As she reached up to unfasten the clasp of her necklace before the glass cabinet in the walk-in closet, a towering presence loomed behind her. The man's commanding presence filled the small space, completely enveloping her.

His hands pressed against the glass cabinet, angling himself to study her face from the side. ""Are you angry?""

Vespera avoided his gaze. She took her time putting the necklace away before replying indifferently, ""I'm angry enough to kill. You'd better watch your back.""

Luke fell silent for a moment before speaking again. ""The Sowle family is interested in collaborating with us on the Polaris project. I've been in talks with Austin Sowle, their eldest son. That woman is his sister, Tina Sowle.""

""So if you don't entertain his sister, he won't work with you?""

""Vespera, I'm trying to explain. Don't be sarcastic.""

""I don't think it's necessary to explain."" Vespera finally turned to look at Luke. Her gaze seemed to pierce his soul. ""Luke, if you're tired of me and want to replace me as the lady of this house, I can step aside.""

Luke's expression darkened instantly. ""What did you say?""

She sighed and replied, ""We can get a divorce.""

As Vespera tried to push him away and leave, Luke yanked her back forcefully. Then, he gripped her face and warned, ""Don't even think about it.""

Vespera didn't respond. Not only had she thought about it—she had already taken action. She didn't want to be with him anymore.

Luke stayed home until late that night—until an unexpected phone call summoned him away. Vespera caught the faint sound of a tearful voice on the other end of the line.

…

The next morning, Vespera's lawyer and close friend, Rebecca Snyder, who was handling her divorce, sent her a screenshot. It was a new post from Luke's girlfriend—a photo of two hands, one noticeably larger than the other, forming a heart against a scenic sunrise. The caption read, ""When love greets the day"".

Vespera recognized the larger hand instantly—it was Luke's. She sat frozen, her fingers curled around a glass of water. She wasn't sure how long she had been gripping it.

The sharp, clear sound of the cup hitting the surface triggered a feeling of loss in Vespera. It was as if something within her had broken too.

Days passed, and Luke never returned home. Their only encounters were in company meetings—him at the head of the table, her among the executives. They didn't look at each other, and Vespera never once went to find him at his office either.

Instead, she filled her time searching for apartments and methodically discarding every gift he had ever given her—anniversary presents, birthday gifts, Valentine's Day tokens, wedding mementos. She even sold her wedding ring.

Why hold onto reminders of a love she no longer wanted?

…

That evening, Elena Hortwall, the lady boss of Westfield Group, invited Vespera to join her at a club.

At first, Vespera hesitated—it was already close to eleven—but after some thought, she decided to go.

Now that she was divorced and would be leaving Eclipse Group, she would need connections for her business ventures.

As soon as she stepped into the club, she spotted Elena.

""I could have gone up by myself. You didn't have to come down,"" Vespera said.

Elena linked arms with her affectionately as they stepped into the elevator. ""I was worried you'd get lost. You've never been here before, have you?""

That was true. She hadn't.

The two headed upstairs, and Elena led Vespera into a spacious private room. A large screen stood in the center, dividing the space.

As they entered, Vespera noticed a few people on the other side of the screen, but Elena didn't take her there. Instead, she led her to a quieter section with only one other person. That person looked vaguely familiar, possibly the girlfriend of one of Luke's friends.

The woman seemed to recognize Vespera too. Though she looked slightly uneasy, she still managed a polite smile.

After Vespera removed her coat and sat down, Elena left.

Vespera lifted the drink given to her, taking a slow sip. From beyond the screen, the cheerful sounds of conversations drifted over—until suddenly, her name was mentioned.

""Luke doesn't bring Vespera to our gatherings anymore.""

""Of course not. Ms. Sowle is young and adorable. He takes her everywhere now, like she's the center of his universe.""

""Guess Luke finally changed his taste after all these years.""

""No matter how beautiful Vespera is, eight years in bed with the same woman? He must be bored out of his mind.""

""She's such a fool. After all that time with Luke, she was just a placeholder. Hey, if he doesn't want her anymore, maybe I should take a shot. I've had my eye on that waist of hers for years.""

…

Vespera's gaze turned ice-cold. She recognized two of the voices; they were friends of Luke, men who had always addressed her as Mrs. Munoz with excessive sweetness.

The woman beside her looked mortified, unwilling to meet her gaze. When Vespera rose from her seat, she assumed she was about to flee in embarrassment.

But Vespera did no such thing. Instead, she cleared her throat, picked up her drink, and strolled leisurely to the other side of the screen.

She leaned against it, tilting her head as she addressed the group in an easy, conversational tone. ""Just so we're all on the same page—when Luke and I first got together, he was an inexperienced virgin. So really, wasn't I the one who got to use him for eight years for free?""

The room fell silent. Every face on the couch stiffened in utter disbelief.

And before anyone could recover, two tall figures stepped into the room.

The group stiffened further, eyes darting between Vespera and the men standing behind her, dread settling deep in their bones.

Chapter 3

Luke stood behind Vespera, his presence exuding an icy chill.

Sensing the shift in the room, Vespera glanced over her shoulder. So, he had been here all along.

She quickly turned back, her gaze landing on the short-haired woman sitting in the corner of the couch. Earlier, Tina had been lounging smugly, one leg crossed over the other, absentmindedly twirling her hair around her finger.

But now, her expression had completely soured. Her smile was gone, replaced by a murderous glare.

It was clear Luke and Tina had been meeting up with the rest. Judging by their friends' casual tone, this wasn't just a one-time occurrence—it had happened enough times that they no longer bothered to hide it.

Luke took a step forward. The group, as if suddenly released from paralysis, sprang into action.

""We're sorry! We were just talking nonsense.""

""Mrs. Munoz, nothing is going on between Luke and Ms. Sowle!""

""Mrs. Munoz, please don't take it seriously.""

Luke grabbed Vespera's wrist, intent on dragging her away. But before he could, she turned and threw her drink straight into his face.

The room fell into a dead silence. Everyone watched, their scalps tingling. Did she really just do that?

Then, Vespera flashed a wide smile and said, ""Enjoy your time with your sweetheart. I wouldn't want to spoil the fun.""

She lowered her head, attempting to pry his fingers off her wrist.

Luke's expression darkened. Without a word, he scooped her up, slung her over his shoulder, and strode out.

The room fell silent.

Out in the hallway, Vespera struggled fiercely against his hold. Just then, the elevator doors slid open.

As Luke stepped inside and turned around, her eyes were drawn to the sleek black leather shoes, the straight legs clad in tailored black suit pants, and the pale, slender hands resting at his sides. His fingers were long and elegant.

The atmosphere was thick with silence and unease.

As they exited the elevator, Vespera couldn't resist looking up. She saw a pair of deep, piercing eyes staring down at her.

Vespera was speechless as she lowered her head, covering her face.

Outside the club, Luke tossed her into the car's back seat before getting in himself.

Dizzy and disoriented, Vespera sat up. After being upside down for so long and then thrown into the car, she felt like she might have a concussion.

Luke pulled a wet wipe from the car's compartment and began wiping his face.

Out of the corner of her eye, Vespera caught a glimpse of something behind the tissue box—it looked like a condom.

Before she could say anything, Luke demanded, ""Why did you come here? To catch me cheating?""

Disgusted, she reached for the door handle, ready to get out. The car was filthy.

""Vespera!"" Luke yanked her back inside, his voice filled with irritation. ""Where do you think you're going? Are you done yet?""

Her breathing was unsteady. She pressed her fingertips and murmured, ""I want to go home.""

Luke called Osbert, who was waiting outside the club, and told him to drive.

The ride was silent. Vespera sat as far from Luke as possible, her complexion pale as if she might throw up at any moment.

When they finally arrived home, she wasted no time getting out of the car.

Vespera hurried to the kitchen and gulped a full glass of ice-cold water. Finally, she felt slightly better.

When she returned to the living room, Luke was already seated. She walked over and sat down as well. Another suffocating silence stretched between them.

Finally, Luke spoke. ""I was there to discuss a project. You stormed into the club and made a scene. I'm so humiliated. Do you have any idea how foolish, how repulsive you looked? You behaved like a shrew.""

""Okay. Anything else?"" Vespera asked calmly.

""If you still want this relationship to last, stop these unnecessary suspicions. I don't have time to cater to your emotions.""

""Alright. Anything else?""

Luke frowned and replied, ""Do you have any idea how annoying you are right now?""

Vespera smiled faintly as she stood up. Soon, he won't have to be annoyed anymore. With that, she turned and headed upstairs.

Luke's irritation grew at her smile. After sitting in the living room for a while, he went upstairs to their bedroom, only to find that she had already gone to bed. He showered and lay down beside her.

In the darkness, Vespera turned away from him, shifting toward the edge of the bed to avoid any contact.

Luke turned and embraced her, forcefully pulling her from the edge into his arms. His movements tinged with anger.

His tall, strong frame easily overpowered her, holding her so tightly she couldn't move. So, she spent the night rigid in his embrace.

The next morning, Vespera only prepared breakfast for herself. When Luke went downstairs, he found her eating bread alone. As he was about to leave, he changed directions and approached the dining area.

Leaning close to her ear, he said gently, ""Let's go out to the sea this weekend, just the two of us.""

Vespera hummed in response while drinking her milk. Unsurprisingly, the day before the weekend, he canceled on her again, saying he needed to fly to Holsword.

Vespera felt nothing. Perhaps Luke hadn't even realized how long it had been since they last shared a meal or truly spent time together. He warned her against entertaining thoughts of divorce, yet in reality, he treated her like she was invisible, as if it made no difference whether she was there or not.

That weekend, Vespera packed the books from her shelf and moved them to her new home. As she was arranging them, her phone rang. It was her mother-in-law, Felicia Jensen.

Vespera answered and politely said, ""Hello, Mrs. Munoz.""

Felicia's voice carried its usual condescension. ""Come over. We need to finalize the document we discussed earlier.""

""Is that really necessary?""

""It is if I say so.""

""Okay. I'll come by this afternoon.""

""No, come at noon.""

""Fine.""

Vespera agreed, as she had no other plans.

Meanwhile, Felicia stood by the window, watching with satisfaction as Luke and Tina strolled in the garden. She wanted Vespera to see what a truly perfect couple looked like.

Chapter 4

Vespera arrived at the Munoz residence at 11:40 am.

The butler, Walter Osland, was visibly startled to see her. He knew another guest was expected today but hadn't realized it would be Vespera. His forehead broke into a cold sweat at the thought of Luke and Tina in the living room.

Very few people knew about Vespera and Luke's marriage. Aside from their parents, only a handful of close aides, including Osbert and Walter, were aware of the truth.

""This way."" Walter had no choice but to follow Felicia's instructions. He braced himself as he led Vespera inside.

Before they reached the living room, a sweet, affectionate voice rang out. ""I won again. Luke, were you letting me win on purpose?""

Vespera stopped in her tracks. Her mind suddenly went blank. Then, everything became crystal clear.

She couldn't help but let out a cold laugh before entering the living room.

Vespera had been shifting her books earlier, so she hadn't bothered with makeup today. She was dressed casually in a loose white shirt and jeans. Her long hair was gathered into a loose ponytail with a simple ribbon.

Yet, even in such an understated look, her skin remained fair, and her dark eyes were striking against the natural redness of her lips. A few stray strands of hair fell against her cheek, adding an unintentional touch of allure to her beauty.

Luke was taken aback to see Vespera. ""Why are you—""

""Your mom called me over,"" Vespera interrupted coolly. She glared at Luke and continued, ""Weren't you supposed to be in Holsword? When did you learn to teleport?""

Luke was at a loss for words as a flicker of guilt flashed across his eyes.

Tina rose from the couch and walked up to Vespera, extending a hand with a provocative smile.

""Hello, I'm Tina Sowle.""

Vespera didn't spare her a glance, treating her as if she were nothing more than air.

Just then, Felicia entered the living room. She cast a brief look at Vespera before affectionately holding Tina's hand. ""Did you have fun today? Make yourself at home.""

Then, she introduced Vespera. ""This is Ms. Vespera Gildon. She works at Eclipse Group. I asked her to come over for a discussion.""

Everyone knew Vespera was Luke's wife. Yet Felicia deliberately reduced her to nothing more than a company employee, making it clear she had no intention of acknowledging her as family. This also told Tina that Vespera was insignificant and didn't threaten Luke and Tina's impending marriage.

Tina lifted her chin proudly. ""Oh? She's just a company employee?""

Vespera didn't react to either of them. Instead, she turned her gaze to Luke and watched him in silence. She wanted to see how he would respond.

However, Luke merely sat there, his face as cold and indifferent as ever, making no effort to correct the insult.

Did he not understand what was happening? No. He understood perfectly. He just didn't care if she was humiliated.

Vespera turned to Felicia and said, ""Mrs. Munoz, didn't you call me here for a discussion? Let's just speak here.""

""We can discuss another day. Since you're already here, stay for lunch.""

""I won't be staying for lunch. I have other matters to attend to.""

With that, Vespera turned to leave.

Felicia bellowed, ""How can you show such disrespect when an elder invites you to a meal? Where are your manners?""

Vespera turned and looked at her. After a short pause, she said, ""Okay. I'll stay for lunch. Just don't regret it.""

Then, she walked over and chose a single-seat chair for herself.

Tina sat beside Luke and wrapped her arm around his. ""Let's continue our game.""

Luke pulled his arm away and looked at Vespera. ""Do you know how to play checkers, Ms. Gildon?""

Vespera glanced at the exquisite set on the table and quickly noticed the game strategy. It was such a simple setup, and yet Luke lost.

So, he did know how to humor someone. Just not her.

Vespera lifted her gaze and smirked at Luke. ""I do. Would you like to play, Ms. Sowle?""

Luke's expression darkened slightly, his gaze flashing with warning.

Tina confidently reset the board. ""White or black, Ms. Gildon?""

Vespera picked up a black piece and said, ""Black. Seems fitting for me.""

Luke was speechless, while Felicia and Tina were about to laugh at her self-deprecation—plenty of people got shaded, but few shaded themselves.

Yet, after a few seconds, they realized she wasn't mocking herself. She was mocking them.

Tina clenched her teeth and made the first move. Piece by piece, the game unfolded.

Felicia noticed how strategically Tina had placed her pieces while Vespera's moves seemed scattered and aimless. She was biased toward Tina, so she didn't analyze the game carefully.

Then, Felicia shot Luke a look. That was the difference between a well-bred lady from a prestigious family and a nobody. However, Luke showed no reaction.

The game continued, and each time Tina thought she was about to win, Vespera blocked her path. Her emotions fluctuated with each turn, and she grew increasingly impatient. Still, she reassured herself that the match would end in a draw even if she couldn't win. It was disgraceful to tie with Vespera, after all.

""Your move,"" Vespera said.

Tina had already placed three pieces in a hidden corner. If she could just add one more, victory was hers.

She feigned composure and made her move. Then, she anxiously watched and prayed that Vespera didn't notice.

When Vespera placed her next piece elsewhere, Tina declared triumphantly, ""I win!""

Felicia immediately applauded in delight. However, they soon watched in stunned silence as Vespera began calmly collecting the pieces. They noticed that she had already won the game.

Felicia and Tina went pale.

Chapter 5

Vespera collected the remaining two pieces.

The checkers game was supposed to be winner-takes-all, but Tina was unwilling to accept defeat. So, she decided to act shamelessly.

""Even though you won first, I also have five in a row now. So I win too."" She defiantly placed another piece on her row of four, claiming victory.

Vespera stared at Tina briefly as if she were a fool. ""Well, if that's the case, I guess I can keep going too.""

With that, she placed another piece on the board, easily completing another row of five.

Over the next minute, Vespera nearly cleared the board, blocking Tina at every turn until the latter couldn't make any move.

Tina's face turned red, then pale, and she demanded a rematch.

Second game, third game, fourth game...

Vespera either toyed with Tina, slowly crushing her spirit, or ended the game swiftly with precise, ruthless moves. Having been treated like a fool, Tina burst into tears.

""Enough!"" Luke snatched the game box from Vespera's hands with an icy expression.

Seeing Luke take her side, Tina threw herself into his arms, sobbing as if Vespera had bullied her.

Luke and Felicia comforted Tina. Then, the latter scolded Vespera, ""It's just a game of checkers. Why take it so seriously? You're so petty and competitive. It's clear you come from a poor family!""

The voices around Vespera blurred into a meaningless hum.

Luke's face, once so bright and radiant in her eyes, now seemed like a faded, distorted film reel, unrecognizable and dull.

Whatever. 20 more days. She'd let him do as he pleased.

Vespera tossed the remaining pieces onto the board, her expression bored and indifferent. She then stood up and walked away.

A few drops of blood fell onto the board as she scattered the pieces. It wasn't until she stepped outside and felt the coolness on her fingers that she realized she had been clenching her fists so tightly that her nails had dug into her palms, drawing blood.

""Vespera!"" Luke called after her, his voice finally tinged with a hint of panic.

He tried to chase after Vespera, but Tina clung to his waist, crying even harder.

Vespera left the Munoz residence. Her phone rang incessantly on the drive as Luke was calling her repeatedly. She blocked his number without hesitation.

Then, Vespera sent a message to Felicia. ""15 million dollars! If you short me even a single cent, I'll make sure you pay dearly for it!""

Felicia nearly had a heart attack when she read the message.

Vespera drove on, the world outside her window shifting as the sky darkened and rain began to fall. Her thoughts scattered like the raindrops, unfocused and drifting.

Suddenly, a flash of yellow zipped past her—a motorcycle swerved recklessly in front of her car. Her heart lurched, and she slammed on the brakes.

The next second, a loud crash jolted Vespera from behind. Her head snapped forward, hitting the steering wheel.

A sharp pain spread from her temple. When she looked up, the rain-soaked world outside was tinged with red. She grabbed a tissue and wiped the blood from her eyes.

Vespera had been rear-ended, and the yellow motorcycle that had cut her off was now nowhere to be seen.

Just then, someone tapped on her car window. Vespera rolled it down to find herself eye-to-eye with a man who appeared to be in his late 40s or early 50s. He was wearing glasses and carrying a sleek black umbrella.

Raymond Chandler's demeanor was calm and polite, his expression apologetic. ""Miss, I'm terribly sorry. I'm the one who collided with you. We'll take full responsibility. My boss is in a bit of a hurry right now, so could we exchange contact information? You can send us a list of damages later, and we'll make sure to cover everything.""

""Let's just wait for the police to handle it,"" Vespera replied flatly.

Vespera was already in a foul mood, and after being startled twice in quick succession, her frustration had reached its breaking point.

She got out of the car and walked to the rear, where she saw the back of her car dented from the collision with the Bentley behind her. Frowning, she took photos for evidence and called the police.

Seeing her insistence, Raymond didn't try to stop her. He returned to his car to report the situation. ""The lady isn't willing to settle privately. What should we do?""

The rain grew heavier. The windshield wipers pushed the rainwater aside, only for the glass to be quickly covered again by a fresh layer of mist.

Inside the car, a man lounged casually, his gaze fixed on Vespera, who was holding her forehead with one hand while talking on the phone.

She radiated intense frustration, her white shirt soaked through by the rain. Droplets clung to her long lashes before falling onto her red lips.

Raymond called out once again. ""Mr. Reid?""

Dominic Reid glanced at his watch before replying, ""Gerard is on his way. I'll leave first. You stay and handle this.""

""Understood.""

Vespera returned to her car. A short while later, the police arrived, followed by a silver Maybach.

The two cars stopped almost simultaneously.

She got out of her car. The occupants of the other car also stepped out.

Aside from Raymond, a tall, elegant figure emerged. His skin was pale, his deep eyes sharp and commanding. When he noticed her gaze, he glanced her way with a piercing look.

The man seemed familiar.

""Give this to her.""

Dominic handed Raymond the suit jacket, which was casually draped over his arm. He then got into the Maybach without a glance.

Raymond hurried over to Vespera with the jacket. ""Miss, your clothes are soaked. Please put this on.""

Vespera looked down and realized her white shirt was clinging to her body, almost revealing her undergarments.

Embarrassed, she accepted the jacket and slipped it on. ""Thank you.""

Raymond spoke quietly with the police officer while the Maybach slowly pulled away, cutting through the rain and disappearing into the mist. Vespera caught only a fleeting glimpse of the man's striking profile.

The jacket still carried its owner's warmth, and a faint, soothing sandalwood scent dispelled the chill of the rain.

The police concluded the matter, and both parties agreed to exchange contact information.

Raymond offered to accompany Vespera to the hospital to have her forehead injury checked, but she politely declined. By now, her mood had settled, and she apologized for her earlier overreaction, admitting it was due to her foul mood rather than their fault.

""I'll have the jacket cleaned and return it to you.""

Raymond didn't argue. He was familiar with Dominic's temperament; even if the jacket were returned, he likely wouldn't want it back. Still, he nodded politely.

Vespera went to the hospital alone.

…

Meanwhile, Luke, unable to reach her and with the rain pouring down, was plagued by terrifying thoughts.

Knowing that the El Portal (where NPMD, Spies Are Forever Concert, and CC played) is a lot bigger than the Matrix (the original TGWDLM theater) so I think the set will be changed significantly to play to the different crowd size/shape. Also I think stuff like the bushes bit when Paul and Emma are sneaking around will be adjusted accordingly.

My guess as to how tracks are going to go, similar to many other guesses I've seen online, is that Joey will play Pete in the Beanie's scene while Will takes over the rest of the roles. Also it would be really funny to see Max in La Dee Da Day

Building on that, in the actual performance if Joey reprises, I think Pete will basically be Ted with glasses and suspenders visually. In that situation, for the proshot I hope that he could go full Pete meaning the beanies scene would be shot last with a mustache-less Pete. I think there's precedent for these live to proshot changes, too - correct me if i'm wrong but in the NPMD digital ticket it looks like Lauren wears a wig for her Emma scenes while in the proshot it's in a bun that looks closer to her TGWDLM look. Another instance is Joey playing the movie theater teen during the Black Friday finale in person but Ted in the proshot.

Also, for proshot I think it would be cool if cast who are part of the overarching hatchetfield saga can make cameos even if they aren't participating in the restaging! Knowing the famous Nick Lang Emma performance, as well as precedent set by NPMD and CC, there will 100% be understudies and they will make cameos (Cup of roasted/poison coffee patrons? Smoke club kids? La Dee Da Da Day ensemble? Workin' Boys? Anything is possible).

Here's my biggest theory: I think this is going to be a one-off situation. I think that the Langs being more hands off gives them more time to work on more Lands that Are works, or maybe a new project entirely! Reprise give them a chance to give the green light then go off to do something else, with some added benefits: the returning casts get to give it another crack (I'm excited to see Jon and Mariah's performances!!), and SK gets to make a \*definitive\* TGWDLM while avoiding a certain Hidgens shaped elephant in the room. Lastly, and I mean this in the most non-cynical way possible, but Mariah joking about TGWDLM returning being a recession indicator is true. Hatchetfield is, by the numbers, the most popular thing they've done since the Very Potter trilogy (not a reflection on quality, we all have our favorites). I doubt  that it won't be a smash hit, and it could give the company a good bit of breathing room for experimentation in the future. I can't think of another show that would make a lot of sense to restage, especially if they try to bring back the original casts, but never say never!",3,1745394507.0,StarKid,1,1.0,False

My husband and I live far away from our family, we emigrated to another country couple years ago. So of course we don't see our family often, it's just me and him everyday.
He lost a very important family member almost the same time we emigrated, which I think it's very important for you to know.

What happens it's that his family call him everyday. Almost 3 or 4 times a day. We are having dinner and his dad call. Or we are watching a movie and we stop the movie to talk with his mom. And so on. 
When I try to talk with him and ask him for his day, he says nothing important. I'm always talking or trying to continue the conversation. But for example, later on I find out something happened and he sent picture or already talked with his family that same day that the thing happened. Like, his office bought a new coffee machine, and that same day that the office received it he sent picture to his family and bla bla bla. 

What I mean with this, it's that something exciting happen in his life, and the first person that comes to his mind it's his family. Not me. And I know, I want to understand, that because he lost someone important recently and that we are not close to our family he wants to still make them part of our life. But, I feel so sad because when something exciting happens the first thing that I want to do it's to talk with him about it, he's my first call, my first thought, my first everything. And for him, I'm nothing. When I ask him, he's just: ""Oh, I forgot"".

I tried to talk with him about how this makes me feel. But he just said it's not important, and that it shouldn't care me. But I do care, a lot. 
And I just want to now, if he's right and this doesn't matter, he's nice, a good person and husband. But, I'm just sad.

I purchased my Vertuo Next at the end of January and with the machine I got a lot of different pods of different sizes to taste. I’m Italian and we don’t use to drink mug size coffes, so I purchased mug pods with the intention of extracting them to double in the expert mode (also because even here there’s a big choice of mug coffee tastes).

After a while I found I’m pregnant and I have to reduce my coffees from three to one single espresso per day. Now, I’m, finishing my espresso pods and I still have lot of double and mug pods to use. 
I was wondering if the caffeine content would lowers or remains the same when extracting a mug to a double or a double to an espresso shot (I found that few mug pods I own have a high amount of caffeine). I was thinking about extracting the mug in expert mode and then stopping the machine after a few seconds to get a single shot. Or throwing away hald of the coffee after the double extraction.

I’d rather read a book than play a computer game. I’d rather drink coffee from beans than instant. I’d rather eat a small amount of really good chocolate than the same monetary value of cheap stuff. I’d rather be mediocre on a real musical instrument than be perfect with auto-tune. So I get, as I age (and I will have done more of that than most of you I would guess) an increasing sense of frustration with the shop-window culture that has gripped the world. Everything is about superficial appearances, and less and less about what’s going on inside. In the shop window analogy, there is no point in having a beautiful window display when the stockroom is empty. Symptoms of the shop window culture are: the ever-increasing use of cosmetics and, worse, aesthetics in younger and younger people; the careful management of social media profiles accompanied by the woeful management of personal qualities of the poster; the agency-sapping metamorphosis of the politico-media complex into a soap opera; the “who has the biggest…?” playground antics of the world’s richest … yes I will say men, in their efforts to go into space; the ease with which people can be offended and the ease with which people are wiling to be offensive; the moving of relationships into an online space;  

I don’t like these things because they are vacuous, they attention-demanding, and so distract us from what is really important, and that anti-progress belittles us all. 

And I don’t like it because of the effect it is having on the generations who are not yet in their 30s. My generation has created this, and yours is paying the price. But I can’t talk about that here, because that goes beyond “I don’t like…” into “I hate…”.

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday–my eighteenth–the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery. 

“Do you phn on making me wait all morning. Auren!” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room. 

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty–three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty–seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the amwual mating ball about a year ago. 

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare. 

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.” 

“It’s coming, Maris–I stopped myself, flinching, “I’ll get it right away.” 

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me 

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, that me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning” 

“Right.” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.” 

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.” 

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn’t a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna. 

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me. 

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine! 

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.” 

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest. 

After delivering the late and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I related to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered. 

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and Intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it. 

“That’s our mate! Siena said enthusiastically. “Go fast. I want my mute.’ 

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd. searching for the source. And then I saw hum… 

Alpha Bram Thome. 

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me failed as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul 

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly. 

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my cheat when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alphs. He was going in pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him. ",1,1745392855.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Thinking is hard right now. I returned to work today. I think I’m mostly through the worst of it. Muscle aches have subsided for the most part. Hot bathes were the only relief I can get to possibly drift off for an hour or so of sleep here and there before I’d be jolted back to my reality I’d created for myself. Sunday night was the worst by far. My hands itched and I was cold sweating all night. I managed no sleep I believe. The last 2 days I haven’t had a very good grasp on time. I’ve been a zombie of myself. Thank god my girlfriend called off and helped me through my first full day of withdrawal. Monday afternoon muscle aches began. Dead legs were awful. Hot baths and massage gun helped.

I woke up this morning (Tuesday morning) or rather watched as the sun rise like a zombie. not feeling a ton better. Decided to tough it out as I am a business owner and my business being closed a single day can be very damaging to clients I’ve built up. I had to go in today. Getting ready was a chore. I was short of breathe felt sick to my stomache. Also had trouble mustering up the strength to speak the first day. Had a bit of that this morning when I drove through for a coffee and a bagel. After eating I felt a bit better and made a few business calls. Getting back to everybody wondering where the hell id been yesterday. Once I made it to work and started moving around I felt much better. Still dealt with being cold and just feeling generally sick to my stomach. As the day went on and my girlfriend joined me at work once she was off at her job. I didn’t have many symptoms. We came home and my once sex drive that had almost completely gone during my use was back in working order. 

Dead legs came back when attempting sleep. Don’t believe I’ll be getting much of that tonight. I opted to sleep on the air bed in the living room to not bother her sleep tonight with baths and general rolling around. Also when I did sleep I’d have insane dream of 7oh tabs and cones. Like the drug was just egging me back. I’ve never withdrawn from anything. Not a huge drug user in general. I’ve screwed around but never binged to the point of withdrawal like this. I’ve never had such easy access to something so potent. If you’re reading this and you’re in the throws.

I’m almost 100% sure that the main characters name was Jim, and he had two friends who were boyfriend and girlfriend, as well as another guy friend that MAY have been British but idk.

They were in a sort of coffee shop when the apocalypse hit with infected people (similar to rage zombies from 28 days later). A female worker at the coffee shop ran off with them as they survived and stuff.

The one guy friend died after turning, and then the boyfriend gets bit. He proposes to his girlfriend in an abandoned hospital before he turns and then he bites her and she dies and stuff.

Then the woman and Jim go and meet the woman’s sister at a random place (I don’t remember where) with another weird old guy there who had his infected wife tied to the bed and refused to kill her.

The movie ended with the woman, Jim, and the woman’s sister hiding in an abandoned church on the balcony while infected chased after them and crowded around the church, looking out over the city and countryside.

The ending shot was of Jim’s nose bleeding onto his hand (I think).

It was filmed in a sort of “shaky camera” way, I’m pretty sure? It had a bit of a depressing grey sheen over it and the sky was always grey.

In fact, I usually skim through them, half-trusting what’s said and moving on. But after using **PrimeBiome** for just 60 days, I felt *compelled* to share my story—because if you’re struggling with gut issues, fatigue, bloating, or even stubborn weight gain, this might just be the turning point you’ve been desperately hoping for.

Let me back up for a second…

# A Life Controlled by Gut Problems

For the past few years, my gut health was a mess. Constant bloating, random stomach pains, fatigue that no amount of sleep could fix, and a feeling of heaviness that followed me everywhere—even though I was eating “healthy.” Doctors ran tests, told me everything was “normal,” and gave vague advice like “eat more fiber.” But nothing changed.

I was tired of living this way—sick of feeling like I was doing everything right but getting nothing in return. That’s when I stumbled upon **PrimeBiome**, and I can honestly say—it felt like someone had flipped a switch inside my body.

# Why I Took a Chance on PrimeBiome

I’d tried probiotics before. Some helped a little, most did nothing. But what caught my attention with PrimeBiome was that it’s not just another generic probiotic. This is a **clinically-backed, spore-based formula** that survives your stomach acid and actually reaches your gut alive—where the real magic happens.

The reviews were glowing. Real people, with real digestive issues, talking about real results. Still skeptical, I ordered a bottle, thinking, “What do I have to lose?”

# Week 1: Subtle but Promising

In the first week, I noticed something odd: my bloating wasn’t as bad. Normally, by midday, I’d feel like I had a balloon in my stomach. But now? Slightly flatter, lighter, more comfortable. I wasn’t ready to scream miracles yet, but the change was enough to keep me consistent.

# Week 2: Energy Boost & Better Moods

By the second week, something else happened—I had more **energy**. Not a jittery, coffee-like spike, but a clean, stable sense of well-being. I didn’t feel drained by 3 PM. My digestion felt smoother. And I began waking up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in months.

Even more surprising? My **mood** improved. I wasn’t as anxious or irritable. I’ve since learned that gut health is directly linked to brain health (hello, gut-brain axis!), and PrimeBiome was helping balance both.

# Week 4: No More Bloating—And I Lost Weight Without Trying

This was the kicker: by the end of the first month, my **bloating had completely vanished**. I could eat meals without feeling like I swallowed a basketball. My pants started fitting better. And without changing my diet or exercise, I lost 6 pounds.

PrimeBiome was doing something no other supplement had done before—it was **healing my gut from the inside out.**

# The Science Behind PrimeBiome (Why It Works So Well)

Most probiotics die before they even reach your intestines. PrimeBiome uses **Bacillus spores**, which are heat-resistant and acid-resistant. That means they make it to your gut **alive and potent**, where they help restore balance, eliminate bad bacteria, and allow your good bacteria to flourish.

It also contains **prebiotic fiber**, which feeds the probiotics and keeps the entire ecosystem of your microbiome strong. This isn't just a supplement—it's a **complete gut health system**.

# Results After 60 Days: Total Transformation

Fast forward to now, and I genuinely feel like I have a **new body**:

* Zero bloating, no discomfort after meals
* Regular, smooth digestion (daily!)
* Mental clarity and sharp focus
* Energy levels through the roof
* Down 11 pounds without dieting
* Skin clearer, sleep deeper, and just… better

I even noticed my cravings for sugar dropped, which made it easier to eat cleaner without feeling deprived. My immune system seems stronger too—I used to catch every cold, but I’ve been thriving through seasons where everyone around me is sick.

# This Isn’t Just About Digestion—It’s About Living Again

PrimeBiome didn’t just fix my gut. It gave me back **control over my body**. I no longer plan my day around when I’ll be bloated or tired. I’m more productive, happier, and finally feel like the healthiest version of myself.

And the best part? It’s just **one easy capsule a day**. No mixing powders, no crazy meal plans, no guessing games. Just results.

# Who Should Try PrimeBiome? (Hint: Probably You)

* Do you deal with bloating, gas, or irregular digestion?
* Do you feel tired even after a full night’s sleep?
* Do you struggle to lose weight despite trying?
* Do you deal with anxiety or mood swings?

If you said yes to any of these, I **beg you** to give PrimeBiome a shot. It might be the missing piece you’ve been overlooking.

# Don’t Wait Until Your Body Forces You to Act

If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably been tolerating discomfort, brushing it off, and putting your health last. But gut issues don’t fix themselves. They **get worse** with time. And trust me—once you feel the difference of a truly balanced gut, you’ll wonder why you waited so long.

I got my bottle directly from the official PrimeBiome website (don’t risk knockoffs from third-party sellers), and they offer a **money-back guarantee**, so there’s literally **no risk**.

# Final Thoughts: PrimeBiome is Worth Every Penny

I never thought a supplement would change my life—but **PrimeBiome did**. I’ve recommended it to my family, my friends, even coworkers. And now, I’m recommending it to you.

If you’re reading this and nodding along to any part of my story, don’t wait another day. Click the link, order a bottle, and experience the transformation for yourself.

# What is Ben Pakulski - Hypertrophy Execution Mastery?

Let’s cut through the fluff—**Ben Pakulski - Hypertrophy Execution Mastery (HEM)** is *not* just another workout program. It's a deep-dive training system designed to teach you how to actually *train* your muscles instead of just moving weights around. You know that old gym bro advice to just “lift heavy and go hard”? Yeah, Ben’s here to flip that outdated thinking on its head. With over 100 video lessons, custom 4-month workouts, and a full access pass to the MI40 Nation, this course is about *smart training for serious results*.

# Who is This Course For?

This is perfect for gym-goers who’ve hit a plateau, intermediate lifters looking to level up, or even personal trainers who want to get nerdy about hypertrophy. If you’re the type who’s been grinding hard in the gym but still not seeing those juicy muscle gains—this is for *you*. Ben Pakulski, an IFBB pro and biomechanics beast, created this with *education first* in mind. So whether you’re chasing that shredded look or just want to train smarter, HEM's got your back.

# When Should You Start?

Now. Like, seriously, *yesterday* would've been better, but now works too. The beauty of **Ben Pakulski - Hypertrophy Execution Mastery** is that it’s self-paced. Start whenever you’re ready to commit to smarter workouts. You don’t need to wait for Monday, a new month, or New Year’s—just hit play on the first lesson and dive in.

# Where Can You Access It?

Everything’s online, all accessible through the MI40 Nation platform. Whether you’re at home, in the gym, or chilling in a coffee shop—if you’ve got Wi-Fi, you’re good to go. You’ll get an all-access pass, so you can binge-watch modules like it’s Netflix for gains. 💪

# Why is It So Different (and Better)?

This is the big one. Most fitness programs tell you *what* to do—how many reps, which exercises, what split to follow. But Ben Pakulski takes it way further. He teaches you the *why* and *how* behind every movement. It’s about **execution**—doing the right movement, the right way, for the right muscle. Every module breaks down the biomechanics, setup, activation, and proper form for each muscle group, which means less guessing and more growing.

# How Does It Actually Work?

The course is split into 4 months, each with a specific muscle group focus:

* **Month 1**: Chest & Back
* **Month 2**: Biceps & Triceps
* **Month 3**: Quads & Delts
* **Month 4**: Hams, Glutes, Calves

Each month includes deep video lessons, workout breakdowns, muscle activation drills, anatomy overviews, and real training footage (yes, even Ben and the crew coaching). You’ll also get quizzes to reinforce your learning, which is kinda fun and helps you retain the knowledge.

# Final Thoughts

If you’re tired of wasting effort in the gym and ready to train with intention, **Ben Pakulski - Hypertrophy Execution Mastery** is a game-changer. It’s not about doing *more*—it’s about doing it *better*. You’ll walk away from this course with a whole new mindset, movement mastery, and muscle-building potential you didn’t even know you had.

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

“No, it’s not–”

“How dare you?” Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. “Throw her in the dungeons!” he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn’t even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons—a dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”",1,1745390918.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1k5spch,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnthai/comments/1k5spch/20_years_long_and_boring/,20 Years [Long and Boring],"I haven't posted here in a while because I seem to have the ability to make people quite angry. However, since this month marks my 20th year of living in Thailand, I thought I'd post a little recap. I'll probably be sorry.

After 20 years I still don't understand most of what I hear in ordinary Thai conversation. To me it remains an unintelligible buzz out of which it is impossible to glean individual words. 

On the other hand I can do fairly well in transactional situations (7Eleven, restaurants, etc) where the gist of the conversation is mostly predictable. 

My reading steadily improves to the point where when my wife and I watch the TV news I still don't understand a word of what the news readers are saying, but I can usually get the gist of the story by reading the text on the screen, often with the help of a dictionary. 

Unfortunately, the ability to read a bit and do well in transactional situations is a mixed blessing. Being able to read a menu and order a meal or being able to tell the 7Eleven clerk that you don't want your Massaman curry microwaved but that you are an All Member tends to leave people with the impression that you are fluent. It then becomes an annoying embarrassment when the other person, assuming fluency, starts rattling off high velocity Thai of which you understand not a single word. In fact, I gave up going to my favorite Amazon coffee shop because the baristas there insisted on making conversation that to me was completely unintelligible.

I should note there that in my long life I have attempted to learn six different languages: Morse Code, Spanish, Chuukese, Chamorro, Japanese and Thai. I have never had a conversation with anyone in any of those languages. Every attempt has been a complete failure.

Not that I wouldn't love to be able to converse with some of my neighbors or the friendly Amazon baristas. But, I know it's not going to happen. I have to live with that.

I kind of wish I were as clever as my wife who gave up trying to teach me Thai fifteen or so years ago. She knew a lost cause when she saw one.

No replies necessary. I just had to write this, mostly for myself.

## What is Global Flow System?

**Global Flow System** is an automated trading platform designed to help users trade financial assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and commodities using AI-driven algorithms. Think of it like a smart assistant that doesn’t sleep, constantly scanning the markets and executing trades based on pre-set strategies or real-time data.

It’s built to serve both beginners and experienced traders by simplifying the complex world of trading. You don’t need to spend hours analyzing charts or reading market news. The system uses machine learning and predictive analytics to help make potentially profitable trades for you.

While it shares similarities with platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge, what makes Global Flow System stand out is its claim of **real-time market analysis**, **customizable alerts**, and a **user-friendly dashboard** that even my tech-challenged uncle could navigate.

## Who Created Global Flow System?

Here's where things get a little murky. Like many trading platforms in this niche, **there’s not a ton of publicly available info** about the exact creators of Global Flow System. This isn’t necessarily a red flag, but it would’ve been nice to see a LinkedIn profile or at least a company name.

What we do know is that it was allegedly developed by a group of fintech experts, software developers, and traders who wanted to create a more accessible and data-driven approach to automated trading. It seems like a smart move—they’ve built a platform that doesn’t require you to be a Wall Street wizard to get started.

That said, I’d love to see more transparency from the team in future updates. A public face or official company registration would definitely boost credibility.

## How Does Global Flow System Work?

At its core, **Global Flow System uses AI and trading algorithms** to scan the financial markets for trading opportunities. It analyzes patterns, trends, volatility, and other indicators to determine the best times to buy or sell assets.

Here’s a rough breakdown of how it works:

- **You sign up and deposit funds** into your account.
- You can choose to trade manually or allow the system to trade automatically.
- The algorithm continuously monitors the markets based on real-time data.
- When it detects a viable trading opportunity that aligns with your risk settings, it executes the trade.
- You can track performance, adjust settings, or step in to manually override trades if you want.

I liked that it doesn’t completely take control—you can still tweak your strategies and monitor trades in real-time. It’s kind of like having a co-pilot you trust, but you’re still in the cockpit.

## Global Flow System Pros and Cons

Here’s the good, the great, and the meh:

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Automated trading** saves time and reduces emotional decisions
- ✅ **User-friendly design** that’s easy to navigate
- ✅ **Supports multiple asset types** (crypto, forex, etc.)
- ✅ **Custom alerts** help you stay informed without being glued to the screen
- ✅ **Mobile responsive**—works well on phones and tablets
- ✅ **Demo account** for practicing without risk

**Cons:**

- ❌ **Lack of transparency** about the creators
- ❌ **No mobile app** (only web-based for now)
- ❌ **Minimum deposit of $250** might be steep for some
- ❌ **No guarantee of profit** (like all trading platforms)

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Global Flow System?

You can access Global Flow System on pretty much any device with a modern browser. That includes:

- **Desktop computers** (Windows, macOS)
- **Laptops**
- **Tablets like iPads**
- **Smartphones** (iOS, Android)

There’s no standalone app yet, but the web platform is fully responsive and works well on mobile. I tried it on both my phone and laptop, and the experience was smooth. No lagging or weird layouts.

## Global Flow System – Supported Countries

Global Flow System is available in **most parts of the world**, including:

- United States
- United Kingdom
- Canada
- Australia
- Most of Europe
- South Africa
- Parts of Asia

However, it’s **not available in countries with strict crypto regulations** like North Korea, Iran, and some parts of the Middle East. You’ll know if it’s available in your region during the sign-up process—it’ll either let you in or politely reject you.

## Global Flow System – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The algorithm constantly scans the market, looking for opportunities based on trends, volatility, and technical indicators. It’s like having a data scientist working for you 24/7.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean and intuitive. Whether you’re a newbie or someone with years of trading under your belt, it’s easy to navigate between trades, assets, and settings.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even though there’s no app, the platform works great on mobile browsers. I traded on my phone while waiting in line for coffee—super convenient.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set alerts based on price changes, trade execution, or market news. This keeps you in the loop without needing to watch the screen all day.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not limited to crypto. Global Flow System also supports **forex**, **commodities**, and **stock CFDs**, which is great for diversifying your portfolio.

## Is Global Flow System a Scam?

I get this question a lot. After testing it myself and comparing user feedback, I’d say **Global Flow System doesn’t appear to be a scam**. It offers real trading tools, performs trades based on market data, and allows withdrawals when requested.

That said, it’s still a trading platform, and no bot or system can guarantee profits. **Always use caution**, never invest money you can’t afford to lose, and do your own homework before trusting an algorithm with your cash.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Global Flow System?

To start trading, you need to deposit a **minimum of $250**. This is pretty standard across similar platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge.

While I understand this helps the platform execute meaningful trades, it would be cool if they lowered the bar to $100 or even $50 to give more people a chance to test things out.

### Global Flow System Customer Support

The platform offers **24/7 customer support** via live chat and email. I tested both and got a response within 10 minutes on chat and a few hours via email. The answers were helpful, not just copy-paste responses.

## How do you start trading on Global Flow System?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the official Global Flow System website and fill out the registration form with your name, email, and phone number. No credit card required to sign up.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll be matched with a broker in your region. You’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff) and deposit a minimum of $250 to activate your account.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Use the demo mode if you want to practice first. If you’re ready, switch to live trading, set your risk parameters, and let the system do its thing.

## How to Delete a Global Flow System Account?

If you decide this isn’t for you, you can delete your account by:

- Contacting customer support via email or chat
- Requesting a full account closure
- Ensuring all funds are withdrawn before deletion

It’s a simple process, but make sure to clear your balance first.

## The Verdict

If you’re looking for a beginner-friendly, AI-powered trading platform that offers a mix of automation and manual control, **Global Flow System is definitely worth checking out**. It’s not perfect—lack of transparency and the $250 deposit are minor drawbacks—but it delivers on usability, features, and performance.

I wouldn’t bet my life savings on it, but for anyone curious about dipping a toe into the trading world with a little help from AI, this platform is a solid place to start.

1k5snh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/StickerSellers/comments/1k5snh3/problems_with_longevity_under_less_than_ideal/,Problems with longevity under less than ideal conditions - help?,"Hello people of Reddit!  Long story short: looking tool, material and medium suggestions as well as advice on how to make stickers that can withstand being constantly outdoors and are subject to all kinds of abuse. I'm not the craftiest person out there, but the dopamine decided to go revisit this rabbit hole and I'm pretty decent at figuring it out once I get started in the right direction.

A coworker buddy of mine has been designing and buying stickers in bulk for over a decade from someone to sell as a means of fundraising for when life decides to show up and someone needs a little bit of help. 99% of them are approximately 1""x1"", color, satin finish, and printed on not the best quality vinyl. The problem is that they do not hold up to the test of time - we're talking after 6 months the sticker paper is still more or less intact, but there's little to no ink left. I have a Cricut Maker 3 that is capable of doing die cuts and there's always an idea being thrown around for a new sticker to slap on a tool box. We've talked about splitting the cost in a printer to make our own. Plus I would love to make some for myself just because there's always something spicy to put on a strategically placed sticker and having fun at work makes the day go by faster.

I'm aware it'll probably be a bit of an investment upfront, but weighing out the cost, quality and convenience should probably land somewhere in a range that's somewhat reasonable. I don't need the Cadillac version of tools and materials, but I question whether a $200 printer and Cricut or similar sticker paper will get the job done.

I work in construction in a relatively humid area and the application would be on a metal tool box, hard hat, coffee mug, lunch box or similar - smooth surfaces that are regularly exposed to all the elements (mainly water, heat, UV, occasionally chemicals) as well as withstanding a fair amount of physical abuse (example, my work mug now lives in an old roll of painters tape, otherwise it falls over). Given the application, it's completely understandable that most hobby crafter's advice is geared towards stickers not intended for longevity, that will remain largely indoors and won't be subjected to the gauntlet these will go through. I know it's not an impossible task as I have other stickers that have survived years that look damn near brand new other than the completely justified physical damage, because construction.

After doing a deep dive, I've concluded that the problem is probably due to the ink - dye vs pigment, low quality sticker paper, insufficient materials, incorrect means of protecting the stickers such as coating or lamination, or some combination of all of the above?

In the research, it started to get pretty technical fast and I'm well outside of my comfort zone. 

I am looking for suggestions on what kind of printer I should look for in terms of what kind of ink - dye vs pigment - specialty condition resistant ink (?), printer models, paper material - what kind of vinyl, matte vs glossy. Probably prioritizing getting the best printer suited for the task as everything else is relatively easy to experiment with. Brands and models are welcome. Also suggestions of how to get better results are also appreciated (in the rabbit hole I went down, someone was talking about outgassing the print before lamination?).

There's too many factors for me to put together a realistic estimate of how much would need to be invested to get started and a general cost per sticker going forward. ",1,1745390609.0,StickerSellers,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The ideal cafe latte cup combines functionality, aesthetics, and durability. The best cups are crafted from high-quality materials, designed for optimal heat retention, and comfortable to hold. Here's a detailed look at the critical features to consider when choosing a cafe latte cup.

**Material and Construction**

The material of a cafe latte cup significantly affects its durability, heat retention, and overall aesthetic. Options include ceramic, glass, porcelain, and stoneware, each offering unique benefits. High-fired ceramic and porcelain cups are known for their excellent heat retention and resistance to chipping. Glass cups, particularly borosilicate glass, offer a modern aesthetic and allow for showcasing the latte's layers. Stoneware cups provide a rustic feel and are often more durable than ceramic. The construction method, such as single-walled or double-walled, also impacts heat insulation and condensation.

**Capacity and Dimensions**

A standard cafe latte typically ranges from 8 to 12 ounces (240 to 360 ml). Therefore, the ideal cup capacity should accommodate this volume comfortably, allowing room for the espresso, steamed milk, and any added foam or toppings. The cup's dimensions, including height and diameter, contribute to the overall drinking experience. A wider mouth allows for easier sipping and enhances the aroma, while a taller cup can better showcase the layered presentation of the latte. The dimensions should also ensure stability and prevent spills.

**Insulation and Heat Retention**

Maintaining the optimal temperature of a cafe latte is crucial for enjoying its flavors fully. Double-walled cups are designed to provide excellent insulation, keeping the latte hot for longer while remaining cool to the touch on the outside. Materials with high thermal mass, such as thick ceramic or stoneware, also contribute to better heat retention. Some cups feature vacuum insulation technology, which further enhances temperature control. The effectiveness of insulation impacts how long the latte stays warm and enjoyable.

**Design and Aesthetics**

The visual appeal of a cafe latte cup can greatly enhance the overall drinking experience. Design options range from classic and minimalist to modern and ornate. Consider the cup's shape, color, and finish to match your personal style and preferences. Some cups feature unique patterns, textures, or embellishments that add to their aesthetic value. The design should also complement the latte's presentation, highlighting its creamy texture and layered composition.

**Handle Design and Ergonomics**

The handle of a cafe latte cup should be comfortable to hold and provide a secure grip. Ergonomic designs take into account the natural curvature of the hand, reducing strain and fatigue. Options include full-loop handles, partial handles, and handle-less designs. The handle's size and shape should be proportionate to the cup's capacity and weight. A well-designed handle enhances the overall drinking experience and prevents accidental spills.

 ## Core Benefits

Using the right cafe latte cup can significantly enhance the drinking experience, providing practical benefits that improve both enjoyment and convenience. Here's a look at the core advantages of investing in quality cafe latte cups.

**Enhanced Flavor and Aroma:** A well-designed cafe latte cup can enhance the aroma and flavor of the beverage. The shape of the cup can direct the aroma towards the nose, intensifying the sensory experience. The material of the cup can also affect the taste, with some materials being more neutral than others. A cup that maintains the latte's temperature allows you to savor the flavors fully, without the drink becoming lukewarm too quickly.

**Improved Temperature Retention:** High-quality cafe latte cups, especially those with double-walled construction or made from materials like ceramic or stoneware, excel at maintaining the beverage's temperature. This means your latte stays hotter for longer, allowing you to enjoy it at your leisure without it cooling down rapidly. This is particularly beneficial during colder months or when you prefer to savor your latte over an extended period.

**Enhanced Comfort and Grip:** An ergonomic cafe latte cup with a well-designed handle provides a comfortable and secure grip. This reduces the risk of spills and makes it easier to hold the cup for extended periods. A comfortable grip enhances the overall drinking experience, allowing you to relax and enjoy your latte without worrying about dropping the cup. The weight distribution of the cup also contributes to its overall comfort.

**Elevated Aesthetic Appeal:** Serving a cafe latte in an aesthetically pleasing cup elevates the entire drinking experience. A beautiful cup can enhance the visual appeal of the latte, making it more enjoyable to drink. Whether you prefer a classic, minimalist design or a more ornate, decorative style, choosing a cup that matches your personal taste can add a touch of elegance to your daily coffee ritual.

**Increased Durability and Longevity:** Investing in high-quality cafe latte cups ensures long-term durability and longevity. These cups are typically made from robust materials that can withstand daily use and resist chipping, cracking, and staining. This means you won't have to replace your cups frequently, saving you money in the long run. Durable cups are also less likely to break or shatter, making them safer to use.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about cafe latte cups, along with detailed answers to help you make an informed purchase.

**What is the ideal size for a cafe latte cup?**

A typical cafe latte contains approximately 8 to 12 ounces of liquid. Therefore, the ideal cup size should be in the range of 12 to 16 ounces to accommodate the espresso, steamed milk, and foam, while also leaving some headspace to prevent spills.

**Are double-walled cafe latte cups worth the investment?**

Yes, double-walled cups offer superior insulation compared to single-walled cups. They keep your latte hotter for a longer period and prevent condensation from forming on the outside, making them a worthwhile investment for those who value temperature retention and comfort. They also protect your hands from the heat of the beverage.

**What materials are best for cafe latte cups?**

Ceramic, porcelain, glass (especially borosilicate), and stoneware are all excellent materials for cafe latte cups. Ceramic and porcelain offer good heat retention and durability. Glass provides a modern aesthetic and allows you to see the latte's layers. Stoneware offers a rustic feel and is often very durable. The best material depends on your personal preferences and priorities.

**How do I clean and maintain my cafe latte cups?**

Most cafe latte cups are dishwasher-safe, making cleaning easy and convenient. However, some delicate cups, such as those with gold accents or intricate designs, may require hand washing to prevent damage. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as they can scratch the surface of the cup. Regularly cleaning your cups will help maintain their appearance and prevent staining.

1k5sm8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1k5sm8v/i_hate_my_spouse_and_i_wish_i_didnt/,"I hate my spouse, and I wish I didn't.","This is going to be long, so I'm sorry for that. I just know I need to put this somewhere or I will genuinely go insane.

Trigger Warnings for anyone who may need them: Abuse, emotional abuse, verbal abuse, neglect, mental health, suicidal ideation, self harm mention

Things have been bad for so long. I had typed up part of the beginning of our relationship in huge paragraphs and it felt so exhausting to even go into that much detail and just acknowledge every little tiny piece of why I feel the way I feel. So this is the version you are getting instead, which in itself will probably still be really long and also all over the place. For that I am so so so sorry.

I never wanted to hate them. Obviously, you don't go into a relationship hoping to hate your partner. You go into a relationship because you like them, and you like their company. But with me and my spouse, I am just so resentful at this point. They cheated on me 4 years ago with the one person I had always worried about. Our relationship had already been really rocky before that. We used to just scream at each other. But they cheated on me four years ago, told me in the middle of an argument four years ago, and our relationship has never been the same. They always find some fucking way to bring up the fact that their friendship with their best friend fell apart and I broke up with them for two months and this and that happened and I just am so tired of it. I don't think they realize how often they subconsciously are trying to excuse their own behavior. They know what they did was wrong and live in that guilt, but still try to subconsciously absolve themselves of that guilt with that ""My best friend of 7 years stopped being my friend but this isn't an excuse,"" ""You broke up with me for two months a year before this and I guess I never forgave you but this doesn't excuse what I did."" And because I was desperate to prove we can fix things and be better and that I would be good enough for them, I rushed us to get married. Within 6 months of them cheating on me, we got married. And that was when our sex life just fizzled out. Their guilt, apparently. Then it was the fact that I am finding myself. Then it was the fact they were figuring out their own shit. Then it was stress. Then it was being too tired. And in a way it's all of them. But, prior to the sex going away, we didn't have much emotional intimacy. Not a lot of physical comfort or even verbal affection. I relied on sex to get that closeness, and then once it was gone, it has felt like I married my best friend. That's great in some ways, but when it's the kind of ""I married my best friend and we hold hands sometimes and we go days without kissing and we don't cuddle and I cry alone and when I do ask to be held I get side hugs and I have to avert my eyes when they're naked and I feel like I am friend-zoned completely,"" it is incredibly painful and emotional torture.

I know, I know. I know what you're thinking. ""Why on earth did you stay?"" Oh, because I have no idea what my worth is in the slightest and because I wanted to give them the room to try and find themselves. Not once did they get therapy like I recommended and instead guilted me about how partners are supposed to give that care to their spouses and I am a bad partner if I don't. I just wanted to try and let them get through it. It didn't help they also would say that sex dropping off happens in relationships and would I leave if it happened later down the line? We are in our late 20s, we aren't reaching our mid life crises yet, so if it were when we were 40-50 I wouldn't have even cared. But... mid to late 20s? Another reason I stayed, I have brain damage from having not one but 2 strokes! I am also disabled from chronic pain. I am severely, severely dependent on them financially and with the fact I am an American I am completely fucked if I try to depend on government assistance (which, I do not have I would have to apply for it). I do not work! There are no jobs that are accommodating around here for how my brain works, and for how my body works. I have very limited range of what I can do, I barely have the mental energy to even participate in my own hobbies. And no, I can't do remote work I don't even have a PC or laptop.

The way this relationship and marriage makes me feel... it feels like a black hole. It feels like my energy, my hope, my happiness, it just gets sucked all away. I have had to process grief, CPTSD, and pretty much any and all stress I have by myself. I don't know how to regulate my emotions, I wasn't ever really taught healthy ways and it turns into avoidance. I would cry, self harm, attempt suicide, or just get stoned and distract myself. I am self harm clean for 4 and a half years, and haven't attempted suicide in so long that I don't even remember how long it's been. I am surprisingly not suicidal anymore. I don't feel like I am depressed even though I do display signs of depression like not being able to take care of myself or my environment and not having much interest in my hobbies. And I am gonna say this right now, I meant it when I said I believe this marriage is a black hole. I believe all my passion and interests and everything is just being... sucked all out of me dry.

Essentially dealing with so much on my own, I've built up resentment. It was small, but you know how bottling things up gets. It snowballs. It really, really snowballs. My grandma passed away earlier this month, and we just had her funeral. And I have had to grieve... pretty much completely alone. At this point in our relationship, we are on a break but with an understanding it's to work on our relationship. My spouse really want us to be together and work on things. We have slept in separate rooms for a year now and we tell people it is due to their job making them go to bed at 8 p.m. but it hasn't been that reason in a long time. But I have had to cry alone, aside from I think once when I went and woke them up to hold me for a but that never goes well. The whole side hug thing isn't such a problem anymore but you can tell they are uncomfortable with touching me. And if they aren't, they have an awful way of showing how comfortable they are touching me. But dealing with this death alone, it has made me so much more angry than I have ever been. My grandma gave us a house, during this housing market and stock market crash. She gave us a house that was recently made vacant that was an old beat up starter home that used to belong to a hoarder. But it was my own home. My grandma took care of me and never made me feel guilty. I grew up abused and she didn't hold stuff over my head like my mom did. So her dying, and me having to go through it completely alone... it has been hell. When someone that close to you dies, you'd think your partner would do little comforting things just to help. I really like when they make me coffee, I have always loved the little acts of service stuff like that but if they're home from work during my coffee time, they never even offer and act slightly annoyed I would even ask. They say it's a joke when they act that way but I just don't think they realize how they come off. I mean I know they don't know how they come off. There's obviously more but this is just so small example I wanted to list. They just don't do much of anything without me asking first.

Sigh. That's another thing. They never realize how fucking shitty and awful they come off. They always make condescending, snide, rude comments. They always try to control my every fucking behavior. I don't think they realize how often they just have to chime in and say ""No,"" or ""But actually,"" when I'm just talking? We were out to dinner with my family (nobody knows we are on a break, at all) and we were interacting with one of the kids in the family and I was telling them a really sweet quote I love which is ""The first step to being good at something is being bad at it."" It's some Adventure Time paraphrased quote which I didn't realize, I haven't ever watched the show. Anyways, my spouse had to chime in, ""No, not always."" Even for small things I can't even just speak without being corrected. Constant corrections and treating me like I am a child. We are a year and a half apart so it isn't an age thing.

I am just tired of a loveless, sexless marriage. I finally found myself, finally started making art again and finding my love for life, and I can't even enjoy any of it. I can't even enjoy it with my spouse. They're miserable all the time and tired and never want to do anything. We don't even have any of the same interests anymore.

I hate the fact that I am so severely financially dependent on them. I want my freedom, I want my autonomy back. In my state I have to be legally separated for 6 months in order to be granted a divorce. I just want to be free but I can't afford this house on my own, there's no mortgage or rent. I can't even afford bills on my own. This house is actually a dream come true for this economy, but I don't even have any way to afford it once I start these steps. And I can't even do anything until I at least have some sort of financial security.

But I have grown to hate them ever since my grandmother died. I have had to go through so much alone. I used to be such a touchy feely person, super super verbally affectionate and I was also just flirty. I was sensual, I was passionate, I had fire! I am now uncomfortable when people touch me. I don't really hug. I am scared to flirt with people. I get physically uncomfortable with praise now. I used to be so soft. I feel so hardened to the world and I hate it. My life has been abusive situation after abusive situation. Went from being abused by my mom to the people I would date. I don't know what it's like to be loved properly. I am so tired of feeling like this. We are free to date with this break and I have tried dating apps but I don't know what I am doing. Everyone wants to do hookups and I have never been that person even if I haven't been touched in a while. It's not about the sex exactly. It's about the connection, and feeling wanted to my core and for every part of me. I want every cell of me to be loved. And I haven't ever had that.

It's so rage inducing to be near someone so emotionally unintelligent, who doesn't see how their tone and words affect you every single day and then act like a kicked puppy when it's acknowledged out loud. It is so rage inducing to be someone who centered their whole life around their spouse, only to realize I wasted a little over half a decade with someone who doesn't really respect me.

I hate that I feel so trapped, and that I know I HAVE to get out. And I can't fake it anymore, the realization has been made and I need to get out but I can't without knowing what's going to happen to me. I don't have friends I can depend on and I am so tired of depending on people anyway, after this whole debacle of not having my own autonomy to leave due to my health shit I am just so tired of not having control over my own life. I have had so much of myself controlled for so long that I didn't even really know who I was until I was left alone to deal with my thoughts by myself for years. I had to comfort myself and own up to a lot of my own bullshit and stew in it because I didn't have much other choice. I found myself through isolation and that is so depressing, instead of finding myself because I was comfortable enough to do so it was because I was forced to deal with it head on because it was the only thing that could comfort me.

I wasn't even crying when I first started typing this but I am now, I definitely am now. I started writing this while angry and now I am just crying. I am so full of hate. I wish I had left years ago when I was still able to work. I wish I had left years ago when I still had my own car. I wish I had left years ago when I still had friends that were offering me a couch or a room. But I was naive, and I stayed.

I hate them for the constant guilt that is there that I have to stay and wait for them to fix their shit. I hate them for taking this job that can support us completely but destroys their mental health because they make me feel guilty for it. I hate them for being so financially awful that we are constantly in the negatives so there isn't even a way for me to try to set aside money somehow to leave. I hate them for making me feel so neglected and shitty that nothing feels right anymore when they're around. I hate them for making me feel so awful that my hobbies are draining for me. I hate them for making cleaning my space not feel right because it feels like everything is somehow infected by them being here, none of it feels mine. I hate them for making me feel guilty for being disabled. I hate them for making me feel stupid constantly. I hate them for the times they made me feel like I was lying about my memory to get out of things. I hate them for the times they said my crying looks and sounds fake. I hate them for constantly correcting me in front of other people or when we are out in public. I hate them for making me feel like my interests are dumb or bad. I hate them for making me feel like I'm not funny. I hate them for making me feel like I don't know who I am. I hate them for when all the times I bring up something shitty they are doing to me and they need to bring up all the things I do that are shitty too in that exact moment instead of bringing up those things on their own time. I hate them for constantly assuming everything I bring up is going to be money related. I hate them for constantly taking responsibilities on they don't need to but insist on taking on but immediately forgetting about it when it's important. I hate them for always immediately doubting my memory when I'm mentioning something I think they're forgetting or misremembering. I hate them for always making me feel like I am doing something wrong by being upset about very valid things. I hate them for making me comfortable with sleeping alone. I hate them for making me uncomfortable touching people when I used to cuddle my friends platonically. I hate them for making me uncomfortable flirting. I hate them for making me a shell of who I used to be. I hate them for all the times they screamed at me. I hate them for all the times they called me names. I hate them for all the times they encouraged me to kill myself. I hate them for all the times they made me cry alone. I hate them for calling me a crybaby and making me feel embarrassed to feel my emotions. I hate them for never considering me. I hate them for prioritizing everything else but me. I hate them for never remembering to get me anything for Valentine's Day, or our anniversaries, or my birthday, or Christmas. I hate them for never trying to get therapy. I hate them for putting all their shit on me as if it's my shit to fix. I hate them for making me feel like I have to go through things alone. I hate them for making me feel like there is something wrong with me. I hate them for making me feel like I deserve a love like this. I hate them for making me feel like love is yelling and love is anger and love is fights and love is sleeping separately and love is going to bed angry and love is never fully trusting them. I hate them for so much.

I wish this weren't so painful, and I wish I had people to lean on. I wish I hadn't stayed so long. I wish I didn't trust them with so many things. As I am crying right now I just realized it's pouring outside, and I always forget to check the weather app and my spouse checks it everyday. Spouse could have told me it was going to rain so I could pull the lawn mower inside, so now it's probably ruined. I could have checked, sure, but that's the thing. My grandma just died and my brain is fried I have been forgetting everything even more lately. Spouse checks the weather app every single day, and if they had just considered me once in their goddamned life they probably would have reminded me about it. But that's the thing, that's the thing. That's our entire relationship right there. Never being considered by them. They didn't even consider I would have been upset about that. And tomorrow they're gonna give me a big speech about how it's okay and we just forgot and we will get a new lawn mower and blah blah blah, and I'm gonna have to just rollover and be happy with that as if this isn't a completely reoccurring issue of never considering the things that are important to be to be important to them too. We can't afford to drop another $200-300 on a lawnmower, and this one has only been used ONCE. WE JUST GOT IT. But that's the thing, it doesn't even matter if we had just gotten it. I could have had it for 2 years and forgotten it outside just once and this would have happened in that instance too. And I know it would, because shit like this has pretty much happened before just with something else.

God, I wish I wasn't a dumb early 20s person and threw myself into marriage out of fear of abandonment. I wish divorce didn't cost anything. I also wish being alive didn't cost anything. I am sitting here, sobbing alone at 2 a.m. once again.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Keep the ruder comments to yourself about how I caused this for myself, or how some of this is my fault, or how I should be more considerate, or whatever the fuck. I am so tired of feeling guilty over them because that's been our entire relationship. I just want to be happy, and in love. I want to feel loved and be considered. I just want things to not feel like this. I know love isn't supposed to feel like this. Love isn't supposed to be like this. I have been guilted by them so much over this whole situation I just expect everyone to treat me like the bad guy, like I deserve it. And I am so tired of feeling like I deserve it. Love is never supposed to feel this way, and god fucking damn it I wish I never let it get this bad before I realized how much I needed to leave. Also, I don't want advice. I don't want advice and none of this is political, I just needed to get this off my chest somewhere because it's getting close to three a.m. and I... really need to sleep but these thoughts were keeping me up.",2,1745390458.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.75,False

## Who Created Nexovix GPT?

It seems to be developed by a team of fintech and AI experts, likely with backgrounds in algorithmic trading.

That said, the lack of transparency is common in this space, and while it might raise eyebrows, it doesn’t automatically mean it’s shady. Still, I’d love to see more openness around the team behind the platform.
