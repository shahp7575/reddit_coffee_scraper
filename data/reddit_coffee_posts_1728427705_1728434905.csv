**I am [M34] and my wife is [F29]. She has asked me to pay her almost $50,000 to have our child, and I'm not quite sure what to do.**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t5n70s/i_am_m34_and_my_wife_is_f29_she_has_asked_me_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  **March 3, 2022**

I have known/been dating my wife for 6 years, and we have been spiritually married for 2 years. We are not legally married, although at this point we are essentially common law.

We are both high earners (both earning over $175k a year after tax). We purchased our home together and we have agreed to split the finances 50-50. We paid for our wedding, honeymoon, everything 50-50, althoughl1 did pay for the cost of our rings and her engagement ring. Our mortgage payments were 50-50 and we comfortably own our home now, so much of our income goes to savings, investments, home improvements and discretionary spending.

Because of our incomes, we felt it would be best to keep our finances separate - we're both highly independent people and both very care driven. It's part of the reason I'm so attracted to her - she's amazing at what she does, and I'm so proud to be able to introduce her as my wife and explain what she does.

Unfortunately our first two years of marriage were hampered by COVID and lockdowns. We would have loved to have traveled and saved up quite a bit in order to do this. A couple months ago we had a talk and decided it might be a good time to have kids instead of continuously waiting for better or safer travel conditions. Without too serious discussion about it, we decided to stop using birth control and let things happen as they will.

Yesterday I came home and my wife was on the phone. She seemed like she was in a hurry to end her conversation and tried to evade my question when I asked who she was talking to. It was her sister. They don't talk a lot, so that was a bit weird. She still works from home, so she continued to do some work, then we had dinner and watched some news. Regular, pleasant evening. Then she says she wants to have a serious talk, and asks me to make us some tea and meet her upstairs at her work desk

I make the tea, bring it up, and she starts talking financials.

Her work place allows for maternity leave for up to a year, but only provides 50% of her salary for up to 6 months. The remaining 6 months is unpaid. She was very direct, and said that while her insurance would cover the vast majority of hospital related costs during pregnancy and childbirth, taking a 6 month break from work would cost her almost $50,000 since her pay would be cut in half. She is asking me to compensate her for that $50,000, in addition to agreeing to split any related but unexpected costs to pregnancy and childbirth. Her stance is that she is doing something for us to start a family, but it is not a true 50-50 split if she is expected to take a financial hit for it and I am not, given that our finances are separate. She had a printed list of expectations in terms of what she expected financially, listed some things that her insurance may not cover.

I see the logic in that, but 1 am really very turned off by this because she is essentially asking me to pay her to have our child (or children?).

She saw my hesitation and just doubled down. While her ideal is to return to work after 6 months, she says it's a real possibility that she may require more time off and decide, as things happen, to take up to a year off. So, she had another plan drafted for that. For the first 6 months, her work will give her 50% of her salary, and I would compensate her for the rest, but for the next 6 months, since her work would not compensate her, and because it is something she is doing for the family, she is ""comfortable splitting the loss of her income"", and only asking me for 50% of her sarary instead of 100% for the second 6 month period, and she will take the loss of 50% of her salary. The idea I guess is that both of us ""suffer"" half the loss of income for the second 6 month period. However, if she takes 7 to 11 months off, any months after the 6th can be prorated,.

She expressed that she anticipates and hopes to return to work in 6 months, but that she wants a contingency plan in the event that she requires a year off. She said that taking more than a year off is something she is very unlikely to do as it would put her job at risk, but that she's open to exploring a third plan with me if I feel that it's necessary.

There are also detailed notes about how she wants to keep housework split, with plans to start saving for both childcare and additional housekeeper expenses for at least the first four years. I kid you not, it's a 16 page ring binder that she handed me with detailed notes, some explanations, and lists of expenses.

But the immediate and essential element here is that, she wants me to pay her $50,000 - $100,000 to compensate for the loss of her salary for 6-12 months as a result of her having our child.

I really do not know how to process this. My first thought is shock because, despite our salaries, $50k-$100k is a lot to demand. The idea of a payment plan to have a child iS just gross. And many couples manage to do this without paying their wives to have children. But then, suppose most couples are married legally and a loss to one person's income is a loss to everyone. So in our situation, it makes logical sense, but there's something so transactional about it that puts a bad taste in my mouth.

I didn't fight it or argue, and she's basically allowing me to think about it, but says if having kids is something were going to do, she wants to write up an agreement and go to a lawyer (splitting the cost of that is ALSO in the binder).

What really hits me here is that she was talking to her sister on the same day she brings this up to me. Why on that day? On the same day she mentions this to me? They do not talk often. am partially excited and scared that the timing of this means that she is actually currently pregnant and that my response to her will have real consequences if I disagree with her. She has previously had an abortion, and only told me after the fact (almost a year later), because it was early into dating. I was shocked to learn that when I did, but supported her choice as it's her body, and at the time having kids would have been the wrong decision for us. Still, the fact that she makes decisions like that so independently has me incredibly cautious right now.

I checked trash cans and such for a pregnancy test but didn't find anything. She also asked for tea instead of coffee, but maybe that is overthinking it because she likes both. I want to ask her if she's pregnant, but we both had busy days today, and I was processing and it didn't even occur to me on the day we first discussed this. Definitely a conversation to have, but I don't know whether that should influence my response here.

tl;dr. My wife and I both earn over $175k a year and we are considering having children. She is asking me to compensate her for 6 to 12 months as compensation for the time she will have to take off to have our child. I do not know whether she is pregnant

I just had three awful games in a row and they all went EXACTLY the same way.

I was begging people to group. but it's like they weren't even consciously playing the game. 

I'm not a perfect player by any means, so I know I made mistakes, but I feel exceptionally helpless is matches like this and it feels like most have been going this way for the last week or so.

For years I’ve struggled with agoraphobic tendencies. They were first pointed out to me by a psychiatrist when I expressed discomfort in riding public transport alone. The thing is, I was constantly doing “exposures” without realizing it. I was forced to go across the city for high school everyday, drive home through traffic, drive to therapy, etc. After quarantine, my discomfort leaving the house greatly intensified. I found excuses for everything, and soon walking down the block alone was daunting. Though I could muscle up some courage to drive to a local coffee shop with an ice bag on my lap sometimes, I usually would find excuses to stay home. Recently I’ve forced myself out of my comfort zone. I signed up for the gym (and sometimes - I’m able to make myself drive and go alone), I’ve gone out to eat with friends and family, and made the 5 hour drive with my mom (3x) to visit my sister at school. I’m also comfortable walking around the neighborhood alone. Though I’m proud of the work I’ve made in the past couple of months, I miss my old life so much. I miss the independence that I once felt. I’ve decided to start an outpatient program M-F to work with therapists one-on-one and in group settings. I’m being so pessimistic and telling myself there is no hope for me. I have just succumbed to this life. I was wondering if anybody had any success stories doing an outpatient program, specifically for agoraphobia. We all can recover.

My dad had COPD and was an alcoholic. We knew he wouldn’t live to be an old man but didn’t expect him to just die all of a sudden like that. He was all on his own. He’d fallen on the floor between the couch and the coffee table.

A few minutes later, I saw that he sent me a request on instagram and that he sent me this message: 'heyyy, i'm so happy that you just did this! That was very cute and it absolutely made my day, but I have a girlfriend 😅.'

I replied with: 'Oh, I totally understand. Of course, I didn’t know :)' and he responded with: 'no worries!! I know it takes courage, I respect you a lot for it :)'

Then I texted him: 'how was your day?' and he left me on delivered for days. I saw today that he read the message but didn't reply. I thought we could at least be friends.

It made me feel really bad about myself. Then about an hour ago, my besties came over to my place, we discussed the whole thing and they both said: ""He probably didn't think you were hot. Trust me, if you're hot enough, any man would cheat!""

Who knew teaching the *imperfetto*—the Italian imperfect tense—could turn into an adventure? I remember this one class where a student hilariously twisted the tense, saying, ""Io *cantavo* una canzone mentre la doccia *faceva* le onde"" (I was singing a song while the shower made waves). It was quite the surf ride, sans the beach!

Alright, let's talk shop. The Italian *imperfetto* is a nifty tool for:

- Descriptions of **past events**. Think: ""When I was young, my hair *always danced* in curls.""

- Detailing **ongoing situations**. Picture a DJ cranking tunes and a party where ""*everything was* spot on.""

- Painting **habits**. Every Friday, the local café would see us chatting away. Sounds dreamy, right?

Picture this: you're *multitasking* in your past. As you *rowed your boat* to office shores, you'd bump into acquaintances—unexpected!

Feeling brave enough to tackle this lovingly messy tense? The Italian *imperfetto* lets you stroll down memory lane, describing everything from idyllic coffee shop hangouts to simultaneous past fiascos or blissful occasions. Are you ready to become an Italian historian in your own life story?

1fzed3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupplementZero/comments/1fzed3n/my_weight_loss_journey_with_benefiber/,My Weight Loss Journey with Benefiber,"So, I’ve been on a bit of a health and weight loss journey recently and one of the things I kept hearing about was the importance of fiber. 

After reading up on how beneficial fiber can be for weight management, I decided to add a supplement to my daily routine to see if it could give me a little extra support.

I've been using it consistently for over a month, I’m now down 7 pounds, and I thought I’d share my experience for anyone who’s curious about whether it’s worth trying for themselves.

Here’s what I love about it and a few things I think you should know before buying it.

What I love about Benefiber:

* **Super easy to use**: It’s tasteless and dissolves completely in water, coffee, or even smoothies without making things gritty. This is a big deal for me because I’m super picky about texture.
* **It really works** – I noticed I feel fuller for longer, especially when I take it before meals. I’ve been snacking way less and my digestion has also improved a lot (no more bloating or feeling sluggish).
* **Convenient for on-the-go** – I take it with me to work or the gym and since it’s flavorless, I can just add it to whatever I’m drinking.

Things to Consider:

* **It’s a little pricey** – You can find cheaper fiber options, but I wanted something that didn’t affect the taste of what I’m eating/drinking, so I’m okay with paying a bit more for that. 
* **Not a quick fix** – While it’s helping me stay on track with my weight loss goals, don’t expect this to be some magical fat burner because you still have to work out and eat a balanced diet.

Overall, I’m really happy with it so far and would recommend it if you’re looking for something to help with fullness and digestion without any funky tastes or textures. 

Anyone else tried Benefiber or have suggestions for other fiber supplements?

Medications taking regularly are Ovima 28 for birth control and managing PCOS for last month, bupropion 150mg once daily in am, multivitamin complete for last 3 weeks, ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for migraines, salbutamol as needed for asthma. 

Birth control medication history of Alysena 28 for 2 months prior to Ovima, depoprovera for 1.5 years, Lolo 28 since 16 years old. 

On to my current question that may or may not require my history: I have frequent lower left pelvic pain seemingly unrelated to my menstruation. I have been managing my Fibre intake for my whole adult life and have a history of rectal bleeding, fissures, hemorrhoids. Whenever I am constipated I feel pain. The best way for me to not be constipated is to drink a single cup of coffee as it seems to activate my digestion and get me to go. However this usually means that instead of normal looking BMs they're loose or diarrhea. My doctor told me last time when I brought it up that I probably just have IBS but I keep thinking about the worst possible cases. As far as I know my family does not have a history with colon cancer but everyone in my family has issues with digestion. I also get frequent acid reflux and heartburn but that's usually when I haven't eaten on time or when I lay down too soon after eating. 

What I want to know is if it's better to keep managing my digestion with coffee or if I need to advocate for a more thorough exam. I have had full abdominal ultrasounds done but I don't know if they have looked at my intestines/colon.

1fzeanf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepAuthors/comments/1fzeanf/the_watchtower_part_one/,The Watchtower (Part One),"I’m struggling to find the proper start to this story. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when everything started. Memories aren’t always linear and I can’t help but feel like I’m piecing together a puzzle made of wrong pieces. However, this story has to be written. It has to be read. If not, I fear that all we went through will be for nothing.

  


In lieu of finding a beginning, I think it’s fair to say that this story begins at a restaurant called The Red Duck Cafe.

  


The Red Duck was a dive. It survived off of a steady stream of locals with an inclination towards alcoholism. The dusty parking lot in the front of the building was filled with rusted pickups and a collection of motorcycles. 

  


It was an old wooden building with a sloping porch and a faded exterior. One of the front windows was broken, then fixed with nothing more than cardboard and tape. Half of the neon signs flickered unsteadily, the other half didn’t turn on at all. 

  


The only mixed drinks that were served at The Red Duck were the ones with the recipe in the title. Tap beer was two dollars at happy hour and the entire place smelt like frying oil and cigarettes. It wasn’t the kind of place I frequented, but it was where my newest client had requested we meet at.

  


It was around seven o’clock when I found myself sitting at a table inside the bar. I waited patiently with a gin and tonic sitting in front of me. I watched the bubbles rise to the surface and pop, thinking about very little at all.

  


The bartender, an older man with a long beard, was the only other inhabitant of the bar at that time. He stood behind the bar, cleaning the classes. As always he had a rather bored expression as if there were a million things he’d rather be doing. In the background an old Johnny Cash song played on the radio.

  


When the door opened, a tall, dark-haired man walked into the bar. He glanced around with his hands in his pockets before his eyes fell onto me. He walked up to my table without any hesitation and sat down.

  


“You must be Alvaro,” I said as I offered my hand.

  


He shook it, “call me Varo,” he replied with a half-smile. His voice was rougher than I expected from a man his age. He couldn’t have been older than thirty-five, but his voice was harsh and weathered like the voice of someone much older and rougher. 

  


“You’re Ronnie?” He asked when I failed to introduce myself. 

  


“That’s me,” I said. People were always a bit surprised when they met me, that’s what I get for choosing a boy’s name, I suppose. 

  


“Thanks for meeting with me,” Varo said as he stretched slightly. “I know it’s late, I work odd hours,” he explained. As he spoke, I noticed a strange scar across the side of his throat, it was white against his skin. I tried not to stare for too long.

  


“It’s no problem,” I said. Afterall, it was my job. 

  


After a few moments, the bartender took Varo’s order and returned with a glass of whiskey. Varo sipped the drink, hesitating to tell me what it was that he was asking me to do.

  


After a moment of waiting I said, “if you need someone found, you’re going to have to give me a little bit of information.”

  


“Right,” he nodded quickly, running his hand through his hair. He seemed nervous but I had to remind myself that not everyone is used to talking about people disappearing. Sometimes it was hard to talk about.

  


Varo finally met my eyes and asked, “you like Phoenix?”

  


I shrugged. “It’s better than a lot of places,” I said. 

  


He nodded in response and sipped his drink. At last, Varo asked, “what kind of cases do you typically work on?”

  


“Minor things mostly,” I admitted. “Cheating wives, husbands with second families, that sort of thing…sometimes I’ll work on a missing persons case, but that’s rare.” Being a private investigator was hardly as glamorous as it seemed on the big screen. 

  


Varo hesitated for a moment before saying, “have you found anyone?”

  


I nodded. “Yeah,” I said. “A couple months ago a family hired me to find their son. I found him living with a bunch of other kids at some trap house outside of town. Before that, I was hired to find a man’s wife. She was across the country, living with an ex-boyfriend.”

  


“How do you find them?”

  


“Phones, usually. They can be tracked easily, but sometimes people ditch their phones if they don’t want to be found.”

  


“Then what do you do?”

  


“If I have access to their personal computer I might be able to narrow down the places they would go. People are pretty predictable for the most part.”

  


“What if you can’t use their computer?”

  


“I have my ways,” I said with a smile.

  


Varo didn’t return the smile.

  


“Most people have a handful of locations that they would consider disappearing to. A vacation spot or a town they lived in before. Like I said, people are predictable. And they’re messy. Usually people slip up by paying for something with a credit card or contacting someone from their old life.”

  


“What if someone was taken?” There was an intensity to his expression that led me to believe this was no longer a hypothetical.

  


“It gets more complicated,” I said. “If there’s reason to believe that someone was abducted, usually the police get involved. Sometimes I can help, but ultimately I’m not law enforcement and I have my own restrictions.”

  


Varo looked genuinely disappointed to hear this explanation.

  


“But, it doesn’t mean that I can’t help.” I paused for a moment. “Instead of talking in hypotheticals, can you just explain what it is you want me to do?”

  


Varo let out a long sigh and scratched the back of his head, nervously. “My sister stopped responding to my calls,” he said so quietly I almost didn’t hear him.

  


“How long ago?”

  


“Two days.”

  


“Could her phone be dead?”

  


“No, she’s good with her phone. She never lets it die like that.”

  


“What about being out of cell service, she’s not camping or anything, is she?”

  


Varo gave a small smirk. “No, my sister isn’t the outdoor type.”

  


I thought. My mind spun with questions and thoughts, however, I didn't want to overwhelm him. “Did anything significant happen leading up to her…loss of contact?” I didn’t want to say ‘*disappearance’*.

  


“She got into a heated argument with my mother. She left that night and I haven’t heard from her since.” There was a clear worry in his eyes, a look I knew all-too-well.

  


“Are you asking me to find your sister?”

  


Varo hesitated before saying, “I am.”

  


“I’ll need some information from you in order to do what I do,” I said. “Let’s start with her name, her address, and a cell phone number.”

  


I sat with Varo for a few hours at the Red Duck, learning about his sister, Luciana Delgado. She was a liberal arts student studying in Albuquerque. She had a few days off from school, so she went home to visit their mother in Las Cruces. It was shortly after that when she disappeared. 

  


I dug into Lu’s case the moment I got home. It seemed like a pretty straight forward case at first. A young college kid getting in a fight with her mother–*she’s probably at a friend's place*. If I knew then what I know now, then I would have known that I was going about this whole case wrong.

  


From what I found, Lu left Las Cruces, and eventually New Mexico as a whole. Somewhere on the other side of the Texas border, her phone had shut off. However, just before it lost signal, a singular call was made. The call had been made to a local towing company.

  


After compiling all the information I had, I scheduled a second meeting with Varo to share what I had found. Again, we met up late in the evening at The Red Duck Cafe. I walked inside to be met with the familiar smell of stale smoke and spilled beer.

  


“Why wouldn’t she have found a charger and recharged her phone by now?” He asked. Once again, we were the only two people in the bar. 

  


“I don’t know but the phone hasn’t been turned on since she called the towing company. I think it would be safe to assume that she had car problems and had to get a tow. Likely, she’s still in Judgment. It’s just a little east of the Texas border. It looks pretty remote, about an hour off the interstate, so it's possible she hasn’t been able to charge her phone.”

  


Varo gave a short, stiff nod. He looked even more uncomfortable then when I saw him before. He kept spinning his glass of untouched whiskey in a circle on the table. Dark bags were under his eyes and his dark hair was a mess, as if it hadn’t been brushed in days. 

  


“I tried calling the tow company,” I continued. “But the call didn’t go through. The line was busy both times I called.”

  


“Why the hell would Lu drive an hour off the interstate to a random town,” Varo said. “It doesn’t make sense that she would go that way.”

  


I gave a small shrug. Lots of family members failed to see the connections. “Maybe she has friends in that direction. Lots of young people go to friends’ houses after an argument with their parents. Do you know her friends?”

  


“No,” he admitted quietly. “But I think she has friends who live closer than Texas.”

  


I nodded. “I’ll call the towing company in Judgment once they open again,” I said.

  


“Thanks,” Varo ran a hand through his hair and glanced around the bar. “But I think I should just go down there myself.”

  


“Would you like someone to go with you?” I asked



 

Looking back, I have no idea why I offered that. I wasn’t friends with Varo and I didn’t know his sister personally. Sure, he was paying me, but I was a private investigator, not a bounty hunter. I rarely traveled with clients.

  


Despite this, there was an odd draw to town of Judgment, Texas. I think I had started to feel this draw the moment I had searched its name. In the moment, however, I told myself I was being a good person–a good Samaritan–by helping Varo find his sister.

  


Upon looking into the towing company Lu had called, I found that there was little information online about Judgment. So little, in fact, that it was boarding on suspicion. Why would a town not be labeled on Google Maps?

  


“You’re willing to go all the way to Texas?” His eyes met with mine and I knew I couldn’t take back my offer.

  


“Sure,” I said. “I don’t think I would mind leaving Phoenix for a bit.”

  


Upon hearing what I offered, something in Varo’s demeanor shifted and he asked, “I’ll pay for the gas, lodging, and food, if you’d be willing to take your car.”

  


“That sounds like a deal. I’ve never been to Texas.” Or at least that was what I had thought at the time.

  


Less than twenty-four hours later, I picked up Varo from The Red Duck. He tossed a black duffle bag into my trunk and climbed into the passenger seat. He rolled down the window the second he sat down. I apologized for the lack of AC, and he waved it off, asking if he could light a cigarette.

  


I let him. I had never been a smoker myself but I didn’t mind the smell. Something about it reminded me of a time I couldn’t remember. 

  


Varo let a cloud of blue smoke out of his mouth as I accelerated into the interstate. According to my GPS, it would take nearly eight hours to reach Lu’s last known location. Judgment was only a few minutes past that. Varo and I had already agreed to take the drive in shifts. I would start us off, leaving Phoenix and heading south towards Tucson.

  


The radio played a rather mediocre playlist of the top 40s from the early 2000s. I wasn’t really listening to it, but the noise filled the silence between Varo and I. 

  


I didn’t know Varo well. Outside of discussing his missing sister, we hadn’t spoken much. Taking an eight hour road trip with a stranger wasn't exactly how I planned to spend my weekend, but I was interested to know about what the tiny town of Judgment held. I hoped we would be returning with Lu by the end of the weekend. 

  


“What do you expect your sister to say when we find her?” I asked.

  


“I don’t know,” he blew out another cloud of smoke. It scattered across the dashboard like fog in a valley. “I don’t expect her to be happy with me.”

  


“It’s none of my business but what was the fight between her and your mother about?”

  


Varo shrugged. “It could have been anything. My mother is a devout Catholic, my sister is a liberal arts student.” he said.

  


I smirked. “Has she ever done something like this before?”

	



“No,” he said. “She has a good group of friends in Las Cruces from what I hear. She fights with my mother sometimes but she never just leaves. Not like this. And not to a tiny town in Texas.”

  


I agreed it was odd. From everything he was saying, it didn’t add up. However, I had been investigating for long enough to know that one person’s perspective of something was always limited. There was likely something Varo was missing.

  


In Tucson, I gave up my position as driver in an attempt to sleep for a bit. Varo took over after we stopped at a truck stop. He got back on the interstate, lit a cigarette, and cracked open an energy drink. I gazed out my window at the dark desert skies. 

  


The mountains around Tucson couldn’t be seen in the dull light, but I was familiar enough with the area to know they were there. The interstate was illuminated in a way only an interstate could be. The lights of the cars reflected off of navigational signs and the freshly-painted lines in the road. 

  


I let my eyes close as I leaned back in my seat. I thought about the map we were following and the little dot which symbolized Judgment. It wasn’t long before a strange dream met me in my sleep.

  


*I was breathing hard, harder than I ever had in my life. Tears streaked my face and my feet were bloody, but I kept running. I ran across the rough, desert ground until I found pavement. I wanted to collapse there. Everything hurt. There was so much blood, too much blood. But I had to stay awake. I had to get help. I had to tell someone–anyone–what was happening to me.*

  


*I cried in joy and relief as I saw a car barreling towards me. I waved, attempting to flag down the driver. The car didn’t stop until after it collided with my body.*

  


I woke up with a jump. Varo, who had been fumbling with his lighter, looked over at me. 

  


“Sorry,” I said, not knowing if I had been having a dream or simply a memory. It was a weird sensation.

  


“I’m going to pull off at the next gas station,” he said, ignoring my sudden jolt.

  


“Why? We just left that truck stop.”

  


“Yeah, like three hours ago. I have to piss.”

  


*Three hours*. I considered that in silence as he veered off the road and up an exit. Varo parked the car beside the building and left in a hurry. I remained seated. I didn’t have to go in and I certainly was in no mood to make small-talk with any other late-night travelers.

  


Varo walked back outside, pulling the hood of his sweater up over his head. He ducked into the car and backed out. 

  


“Have you been to Texas before?” I asked. 

  


“I was born in Texas,” he said without explanation. 

  


“Really? Why’d you leave?” I said.

  


He looked surprised by this. “My family moved,” he said simply. “There’s not much to see where we’re going. Just more desert.” He took a drink from his drink.

  


I nodded, I had assumed as much. “Do you plan on stopping? I don’t mind driving again.”

  


“I planned to stop in Las Cruces,” he said. “Is that alright?”

  


“Yeah, that’s perfect. How far are we from there?”

  


“About an hour.”

  


“Are you stopping to see your mother?”

  


“No,” he said quickly. “We’ll fill up and trade places again. I just want to make it to Judgment. I’ll get us a hotel when we arrive there.”

  


I didn’t argue. It made sense to me. Instead, I glanced out the window and began to wonder about Lu’s strange disappearance near Judgment.

  


Hours passed, eventually we made it to Las Cruces. Varo pulled into a gas station on the outskirts of town. I got out and stretched while he filled up the old car. I walked into the convenience store and bought myself a cup of coffee. The man at the counter stared at me in a way that made my stomach feel strange.

  


As I was attempting to swipe my card, he said, “don’t go mistakin’ the wolves for sheep, miss.”

  


I blinked. “Sorry, what?”

  


“Ya need to enter your pin,” he said.

  


“Oh,” I typed in my pin number, grabbed my coffee, and left. 

  


Despite the warmth of the air outside, there was something cold inside my gut. For the first time, I began to feel uneasy. I pushed those feelings aside and told myself that I was just tired, that was all. 

  


I took over for the remainder of the drive. I sipped my coffee, realizing only then how terrible it was. Beside me, Varo reclined his chair slightly and kicked his heavy boots onto the dashboard. I figured he would fall asleep like that but to my surprise his eyes remained open, focusing on the world outside the car.

  


For a while I drove in silence, assuming that Varo would eventually fall asleep. He never did.

  


“How’d you become a PI?” His voice surprised me.

  


“I went to college for criminal justice…I’ve always been interested in that kind of stuff,” I said simply. “After school I decided to pursue a career as a private investigator. Learning the truth about things has always been important to me.” I left out my reasons for this. Not everyone wanted to hear about my less-than-perfect childhood.

  


He nodded. “Did you study in Arizona?”

  


“No,” I said. “I actually lived in Denver for a while before I moved to Phoenix.”

  


“Why did you move?”

  


I hesitated before saying, “I had an…abnormal childhood. I don’t remember much of it…the doctors say it was amnesia. I moved to Denver as soon as I was old enough to leave foster care. After Denver, I found Phoenix, and I guess I’ve been there ever since.”

  


Varo said nothing for a long time. I wondered if I had over shared. Most people didn’t want to hear about foster care and childhood amnesia. It was really a bit of a mood killer.

  


“That sounds like a difficult childhood,” he said at last. I could feel his eyes on me as I drove.

  


“Yeah,” I admitted. It was weird how the night could make you admit things you would never say in the day. “I think not knowing made me want to help other people know.”

  


“So, you truly don’t remember your childhood?”

  


“Not before the age of about fifteen,” I said. “At first, they told me my memories would resurface, but at this point, it’s been too long. I don’t think I’ll ever remember who I was…where I was raised.” 

  


Typically, when I thought of the lost time, I felt very little at all. It was so long ago; I often couldn’t bring myself to grieve my memories. However, in the dim light of the car, I felt an unfamiliar pressure behind my eyes. It was as if the highway was hypnotizing me to *feel*.

  


The sun was just a spark on the eastern horizon by the time we made it to the exit for Judgment. So far, Varo was right about western Texas, there wasn’t much to see. 

  


For the most part, it looked similarly to eastern New Mexico, an expanse of rugged hills. Small brush covered the ground in many areas, providing cover for all manner of desert wildlife. In the distance, mountains guarded the horizon.

  


The exit leading off the interstate was hardly an exit at all. The mile-marker sign had been run over and there was no sign to signify any lodging or gas. I only knew where to turn off because of the GPS I had programmed with Lu’s last known coordinates.

  


I followed the directions off the interstate and onto what looked to be a county road. However, much like the exit, it was unmarked. If this was a red flag, I wouldn’t have known it at the time. I was too busy feeling an overwhelming sense of indigestion, or at least that’s what I thought it was. 

  


“I…I need to pull over,” I said suddenly as I swerved onto the shoulder of the road. Before Varo had a chance to respond. I put the car in park and practically launched myself out of my seat. 

  


I retched on the side of the road, grasping the car’s bumper for support. When I had finished, I found that Varo had gotten out of the car to check on me. He hesitated with a disgusted look on his face.

  


“What’s wrong?” He asked.

  


“I…” again, I threw up. For once I was thankful for the desolate nature of the desert. No one drove by as the contents of my stomach were emptied onto the dusty road.

  


Without a word, Varo handed me a napkin. I accepted it with a nod of thanks and cleaned myself up.

  


“I’ll drive for a little while,” he said as he walked to the driver's side and sat down. “Judgment isn’t far. Do you think you’ll be alright until we stop again?”

  


“Yeah,” I said as I collapsed into the passenger seat. “That was weird. I’ve never been sick like that from driving–it must have been the food.”

  


Gas station food didn’t exactly have the best rap. Likely, the burrito I had grabbed from our last stop had gone bad.

  


Varo pulled the car back onto the road without a word. 

  


“Sorry about that,” I said. I was embarrassed. 

  


“Don’t be,” he said. “It could be the elevation. Drink some water.”

  


The elevation didn’t seem like it would have changed much since Las Cruces. If anything, it would have made more sense for it to go down. However, I did as Varo suggested.

  


“If this town is as small as it seems, we shouldn’t have a problem finding your sister,” I said.

  


“How small did it say it was?”

  


“That’s what’s weird…it doesn’t look like there’s a town out here at all. I mean it’s not listed on Google Maps.”

  


“Then how do you know it’s here?”

  


I gave a small laugh. “Yellow pages. I looked up the number Lu had called and traced it to a towing company called Judgment Auto and Towing. They had nothing listed online other than their number. So, I ended up searching for anything with the name ‘Judgment’ from around this area, that’s when I found it listed as a town.”

  


“That’s strange,” he said. His dark eyes were glued to the distant mountain on the horizon. “It must be really small.”

  


I shrugged. “I guess. Or maybe it’s a bit of a ghost town.”

  


“It could happen. A lot of towns were built off of mining but when gold couldn’t be found, they shrank considerably.”

  


I nodded. I knew all about ghost towns. Anyone who spent any time in the southwestern United States had heard about them. It wasn’t a stretch to say that Judgment was likely dying if not nearly dead. Possibly there weren't even enough people who lived there to warrant listing it as a true town.

  


“At the very least,” I began. “It will be a place to start.” 

  


I stared at the dusty landscape and found it hard to think about a young woman willingly staying out there. What was Lu doing in a landscape like this? Would there even be a hotel to stay in?

  


I wondered about what I would find when we reached Judgment as I gazed out my window. After leaving the interstate, we had been steadily climbing in elevation. We were by no means in the mountains, but the elevation had been increasing slightly throughout the drive.

  


The road was windy, but seemingly for no reason other than to be confusing. It wasn’t long before I found myself disorientated. We were going north? South? I was typically skilled with directions, but the sky had turned a hazy shade of white and I could no longer see the sun.

  


After about a half hour of driving, I saw a giant rock formation on the horizon. It wasn’t a mountain or a mesa, but rather a large monolith-like structure that rose from the earth like a finger pointed up. It was white instead of the sandy color of the earth. I felt an odd sensation in my chest and suddenly, I was overcome with a memory.

  


*I saw the light of day, but it was just a sliver of it. On my hands and knees, I crawled toward the narrow exit of the coven. Rocks scraped my bare skin, but I was determined to make it out. I had to make it out. Behind me, the cave echoed with a noise that made me sick, a dull clicking sound.*

  


*I crawled until I could pull myself out of the cave. The hole was barely large enough for me to fit through, but I managed. My palms were slick with blood as I pulled myself out of the hole in the earth and into the scorching bright light of day.*

  


*A sob overtook me as I collapsed onto the ground. I stared up at the giant monument that now towered over me.*

  


I came back to reality with a jolt, realizing that tears had been streaming down my face. The car was pulled off on the side of the road and Varo was staring at me with a strange expression.

  


“Are you alright? What happened?” He asked.

  


“I don’t know,” I said as I breathed heavily. “I had…a memory.” I stared ahead at the giant stone spire. Deep dread settled in my chest.

  


“Are you…good?” He raised an eyebrow. 

  


I must have looked like a mess. A few minutes ago, I was puking up my guts on the side of the road, now I was sobbing in the passenger seat. *Some PI I am*, I thought.

  


“Yeah,” I said. “I…I think I’ve been here before.”

  


A dark expression crossed Varo’s face. “If you want, I can turn around and drop you off at the nearest town.”

  


“No, no,” I said, coming back to reality even further. I shook off the strange sensations. “The nearest town is over an hour away. We’re so close. I…I think I might just be confused.”

  


With a bit of hesitation, Varo pulled back out onto the county road. I stared ahead.

  


“What is that thing up there?”

  


“A rock formation,” Varo said with a dismissive shrug. 

  


Despite his calm demeanor, I was drawn to his hands. They grasped the steering wheel with intensity. His tan skin looked white from the death-grip he had on the car.

  


I noticed that the road we were on was headed directly towards the monolithic stone. Varo could have been right. It could have just been a rock formation. However, I had seen Arches National Park and Monument Valley. 

  


While the giant stone ahead of us could have easily been a similar formation, there were no others around it. It was a lone rock, jutting into the skies. Its white stone looked unnatural against the dusty, tan landscape.

  


Despite the nausea in my gut and the strange memory I had, I told myself it was nothing. There was no possible way that I had been here before. This was far from where I had been found on the side of the road. I had never set foot in Texas let alone a strange desolate town called Judgment.

1fzeae0,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/1fzeae0/em_caused_a_scene_to_get_her_daughter_dessert/,EM caused a scene to get her daughter dessert,"This story happened when i was trying to get a snack at Cinnabon, which is a dessert place that sells cinnamon based sweets (very good btw).

for the characters

EM: Entitled Mother
C: Customers 
C1: main protagonist (very cool woman)
Me: me
M: Manager
E: employee 

so as usual, i take a break from work and head to Cinnabon to order a cinnamon roll to enjoy with a cigarette and coffee. and as usual its kinda busy, i stand in line which consists of like 10 other people.

as im advancing, there were like 2 more people infront of me including C1, when it was her turn to order, another woman comes walking from the side, SKIPPING THE ENTIRE LINE and interrupts C1 and tries to get her order in.

C1 looks visibly confused and scoffs, so EM shoots her a dirty look and says something like :"" is there something wrong?"" in a very shitty tone.

C1: ""well yeah you just skipped the entire line and cut me off in the middle of my order""

EM:""im in a hurry i need to get something for my daughter""

They started shooting comments back and forth and it was getting kimda heated, at this point i just wanted to get my cinnamon roll and dip, so i interfered just so i can make the whole ordeal go by faster, and i was next in line so i thought id just get it over with.

Me: ""ma'am everyone is in a hurry but we're still waiting in line so you should probably do the same""

She then notices the nametag on my shirt and says something like :""Well im a customer and not employee so i should have a higher priority than you""

I dont work at Cinnabon, which makes me a customer as well, yet she failed to somehow realize that?

at this point EM, C1 and i were just arguing, EM says stupid entitled shit, C1 shoots her down, EM argues back, i jump in, shit got messy.

EM then starts going ape shit crazy, cussing the Cinnabon employee asking him to get the manager or someone with authority and causes a whole scene.

M comes out from the back asking what the problem is, we try to calmly explain but she keeps screaming, calling us peasants and how she should be served first instead of us.

now idk if C1 was also an employee in the mall but she got lobbed into the ""peasant""
 category with me just because i have a job.

thankfully M shuts her down, telling her the theres a queue for a reason, and we get served based on who's in line.

EM gasps loudly and starts cussing out the guy just cuz he disagreed with her.

M:"" ma'am you'll have to calm down before i call security"".

then, i kid you not, this bitch says :""there's no need im never coming here again!!"" and then throws some sort of gang sign (?) with both hands and bursts off.

c1 and i ended up getting free extra dessert which we shared together, turns out shes also a peasant like me so I'll be spending my breaks with her from now on.

overall good experience 
- free dessert 
- new friend 
- a hard ass gang sign i can throw whenever i get into an argument at Cinnabon.",11,1728431648.0,entitledparents,1,0.92,False

I had to stop supplementing with Vit D because of bad side effects (psychosis, anxiety, panic attacks, convulsions) & I’ve been experiencing what I can only call a “withdrawal”

I have low energy, borderline depressed mood, impossible to concentrate, all around feel horrible & seriously miss how Vit d made me feel. It truly felt like the holy grail for mental health. Doctors are full of shit “there is no withdrawal” because I’ve stopped and started Vit D multiple times & everytime around the 2-3 weeks depression and fatigue ramps wayyy up- I would even say worse than before going on it… Anything taken consistently will most definitely cause your body to adjust/ get used to. Vit D also plays a huge part in dopamine and serotonin production.. just warning all of you stopping is not easy..

Anyways has anyone else had to stop after long periods of using it and experienced the same thing? Do symptoms eventually go away as body adjusts or is this just “the new normal”? 

What’s so fascinating to me is I legitimately know it’s dopamine. It’s like I don’t have enough. I’m so lethargic & whats stranger is coffee has just completely stopped “working” for me. I’m used to the rush of energy/euphoria/motivation & it just never comes. So I end up drinking more and more hoping I’ll get the energy I used to get from D & I just end up getting panic attacks lmao

Also a week ago I started vit d again woke up so refreshed positive drank coffee and was soo excited and motivated & did all my laundry and cleaned my room & felt that positive peace..until the anxiety from mineral unbalances started again.. leading me to have to stop it again. 

Please let me know anyone else’s experiences and if this feeling will eventually pass",1,1728431634.0,VitaminD,1,0.67,False

I've always been an avid coffee drinker. I recently got a Nespresso and I love it. But I want to be able to experiment and more importantly, use my self bought beans.

However, the most important price for me is to ditch the single use pods. 

I usually make milk drinks with my Nespresso but could see myself experimenting with straight espresso shots for drinking pleasure. 

I'm looking for a machine that I can steam with, single boiler is fine but most importantly has plastic free parts after the boiler. The only machine I've seen that has this is the Rancillio.. but I'm afraid I can't spend more than $500 at this time. Any other options I can consider?

My Personal Experience,"Hey Reddit, after trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, I felt like I needed an extra boost from supplements.

So I spent hours reading reviews on Amazon and finally decided to try out the Hydroxycut Pro Clinical. 

I know some weight loss supplements can be confusing (and sometimes too good to be true), that’s why I want to share my personal experience with it after two months. 

What I Love:

**Energy Boost**: I’ve always been a bit sluggish, especially on workout days, but Hydroxycut gives me a noticeable energy boost. It’s not crazy, like shaking hands jittery, but just enough to get me motivated for the gym.

**Enhanced Focus**: Another unexpected bonus is that I feel more mentally focused throughout the day.

**Appetite Control**: I do notice that it helps curb those random cravings that hit me in the middle of the day. I'm definitely snacking less.

Things to Consider:

**The Caffeine**: Hydroxycut is pretty loaded with caffeine, so if you're sensitive to it (or if you already drink coffee like me), it can sometimes feel like a bit much. 

**No Overnight Magic**: To be clear, it’s not a magic pill so you still need to work out and eat decently for it to help.

Final Thoughts:

Overall, I’m happy with Hydroxycut so far because it gives me that extra push of energy and control I needed, especially on those hard lazy days. 

Just be mindful of the caffeine if you’re sensitive to it.

Anyone else have good/bad experiences with it?

These are some notes that I compiled on GERD while I have it. I hope it was useful to you.

**What is GERD?**

GERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is a condition where the lower esophageal sphincter becomes relaxed and open allowing for regurgitation of stomach content into the esophagus and back of the throat, or acid reflux. It has many symptoms, the most common being heartburn and an irritated esophagus. It can lead to some complications, for example, an irritated esophagus, or esophagitis, which can turn into Barrett's  esophagus, which can turn into esophageal cancer, or esophageal adenocarcinoma. When it comes to GERD, there are usually many different causes and conditions, primary and secondary which may cause it to be, especially to the long term sufferers.

**Symptoms:**

The most common is heartburn. Then, backwash of food or sour liquid in the throat, upper belly or chest pain, trouble swallowing which is called dysphagia, and a sensation of a lump in the throat. If you have nighttime acid relfux, you are more likely to experience an ongoing cough, inflammation of the vocal cords which is known as laryngitis, and new or worsening asthma, according to Mayo Clinic. Some other symptoms are nausea, post nasal drip or an overproduction of mucus, and frequent hiccups.

**What can be done about it?**

Like any condition, you have to identify potential risk factors and correct them, strive towards permanent solutions to the problems you face, and make the conditions for wellbeing more favorable, or, in this case, make the conditions for not having GERD more favorable. When it comes to drugs and pharmaceuticals for treating GERD, if permanent solutions work for you, which will be the case for most people, then stick with that. The more you study physiology, medicine, and pharmacology, the more you will be repulsed to take drugs even as a medicine. There's nothing in this world for free, you shouldn't stay on a drug for the rest of your life if it's an option. The longer you stay on a pharmaceutical or drug, the more likely the potential adverse effects from the drug will manifest itself, and some of the adverse effects of many pharmaceuticals are very risky. There are many potential risk factors for GERD. In this post, I will go through as much as I can, there are likely some that I haven't mentioned, as physiology is a very vast field.

**The identifiable and correctable risk factors are:**

1. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection

This is, to most, the easiest identifiable and correctable risk factors for GERD. This bacteria may be present in the gut. To test for it, you have to talk to your doctor and give a stool sample. If you test positive, then the reason for your GERD, generally speaking, will most likely be from the presence of this bacterial infection. It's a bacterial infection, so being free from GERD is as simple as taking antibiotics, and possibly other pharmaceuticals for a short period of time. If you test negative, then that is one risk factor to be crossed off the list.

2. Anatomical risk factors

The anatomical risk factors are: obesity, a bulging of the top of the stomach up above the diaphragm also known as a hiatal hernia, pregnancy, connective tissue disorders, such as scleroderma, and delayed stomach emptying, according to Mayo Clinic. To identify the risk factors for many of these, such as a hiatal hernia, you would want to see a gastroenterologist.

3. Smoking, alcohol, coffee and caffeine consumption

Smoking can contribute to GERD by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and reducing saliva production, and cause damage to the LES. Alcohol consumption can contribute by relaxing the LES and can increase acid production directly. Caffeine can relax the lower esophageal sphincter, causing acid reflux. Coffee especially contributes to GERD compared to other common caffeinated drinks, due to it's high acidity content.

4. Certain foods, such as chocolate or spicy foods, and fatty or fried foods

Chocolate has caffeine and theobromine in it, which can promote GERD. Spicy foods can increase stomach acid production, but can also irritate the lining in the esophagus, which makes it more sensitive to stomach acid. While irritation of the esophagus may not be a direct cause of GERD, the very things that cause GERD may be the same things that perpetuate it, or keep it going. High fat foods can relax the LES and usually take longer to digest, which can promote acid reflux.

5. Lactose

If you are lactose intolerant, you may experience some symptoms when ingesting anything with lactose, like gas or bloating. Gas or bloating can contribute to GERD. Every human being other than infants, are lactose intolerant to some degree. So, switching to lactose-free milk would be best to play it safe. When it comes to lactose-free milk, in my experience and the experience of others, certain brands of lactose-free milk taste gross, such as Lactaid. Fairelife is my favorite.

6. Improper breathing

I used to breathe backwards. When I fixed it, I noticed an improvement in my acid reflux. Back when I would breathe incorrectly, when I inhaled, my chest and belly would deflate, and on exhales, my chest and belly would inflate. When you breathe in, your diaphragm contracts, making your lungs expand. On exhales, your diaphragm relaxes, which pushes the air out of your lungs. The diaphragm is known as the umbrella muscle, which is responsible for these contractions. When you breathe in, your lungs need room to expand. I had this whole thing backwards, and so, I had a lot of pressure on my internal organs, which includes the LES. To correct this, you have to change the way you breathe. The recommend way to breathe is to use a technique called diaphragmatic breathing, which is a breathing technique commonly used by meditators and yogis. This method is conducive for being free from GERD. For diaphragmatic breathing, otherwise known as belly breathing, you have to, as you breathe in, have your belly rise as it fills with air, while your chest remains mostly still or slightly expands. As you breathe out, your belly should fall as the air is expelled, while your chest remains mostly still. Another risk factor off the list, wooo.

7.  Poor posture

Poor posture can contribute to GERD directly and indirectly. It does so directly by making less room for your internal organs, which means more pressure on your LES. It can do so indirectly by making you unable to sit it a healthy, non-slouched position, as it is hard to maintain perfect posture if it causes you pain. Good posture also contributes to proper breathing.

8. Dehydration

Dehydration is another. Dehydration can reduce saliva production. Saliva plays a key role in keeping stomach acid clear from the esophagus and neutralizing the pH levels of it. Be sure to stay hydrated.

9. Certain supplements

Certain supplements can cause GERD. The list is very big, so be sure to look into whatever supplement you're taking. One example is creatine. Creatine can cause GERD if you take in incorrectly. It can cause certain adverse effects, such as stomach cramps, diarrhea, and dehydration. To avoid the digestive issues and to provide a buffer for your stomach, take it with food and water. Something small, such as a nutter butter 5-10 mins before you ingest the creatine, and then chase it with a tall glass of water. You can also make it into a shake, but if you prefer eating the powder raw, take it with food and water. A good rule of thumb is if a supplement has the word ""acid"" in it, it's generally another risk factor, such as alpha lipoic acid (ALA). So, be sure to read into it.

10. Certain pharmaceuticals and drugs

Drugs like aspirin, anything with ibuprofen in it, and blood pressure medications can contribute to GERD. For ibuprofen or aspirin, follow the same basic logic with the creatine. Take it with food 5-10 mins before to protect the lining in the stomach. When it comes to drugs, the same general rule of thumb applies. Anything with the word ""acid"" in it you may want to look into, such as valproic acid. Insomnia drugs, any drug that may be used to treat insomnia, or any drug that comes with the subject effect of ""muscle relaxation"" is another risk factor, as it may relax the LES.

11. Sleeping positions

You spend, or should spend, 1/3 of your life asleep. Some sleeping positions are better than others. Sleeping on your side, namely your left side, is generally regarded as the best sleeping position. Side sleeping is conducive for having good spine and neck health, reducing snoring, and it also helps prevent your airway from collapsing. It is the recommend sleeping position if you're pregnant, especially in the last trimester. Sleeping on the left side puts less pressure on internal organs and promotes healthy blood flow, which means less pressure on the LES. A small pillow between your knees or a body pillow will help if you have neck or back pain, or just find side sleeping uncomfortable.

12. Lifestyle and suffering

A lifestyle with no exercising or physical activity can slow down the digestive process. Sitting in slouched positions with poor posture or in long periods can put pressure on the abdomen, promoting acid reflux. When it comes to suffering, namely, stress, your muscles, such as the diaphragm, may become tense which may affect the LES. Stress may increase stomach acid production, possibly through hormonal responses, and can potentiate or contribute to GERD through other means.

13. Age and genetics

As you age, the changes in your body may contribute to GERD, such as changes in digestion, reduced saliva production, and a loss of strength in the LES. Genetics can also play a role, such as having a family history of GERD, certain anatomical predispositions that arise from genetics, and metabolic factors like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

14. Previous damage/trauma and pressure around the abdomen

Previous surgeries that involve the abdomen, injuries to the esophagus, and nerve damage that controls the esophagus all may play a role. Frequent intense pressure around the abdomen, such as wearing a belt too tightly can put pressure on the LES contributing to GERD.

**Helpful things:**

1. Furniture risers

Bed risers will help keep the stomach acid down, since you spend 1/3 of your life asleep. It's recommended to put the risers to tilt the bed and not just the mattress itself. You can also put bricks under the legs at the bottom of the headboard. I just use ""furniture risers."" You can find them online, and tilt your bed 6-8 inches. I just do 6 inches, 7 inches is where the bed starts to look funky.

2. Foods that help

Foods that help are foods high in fiber, non-citrus fruits or foods low in citrus, vegetables, such as dark green leafies, whole grains, ginger, low-fat milk/dairy, and plant based proteins, which are lower in fat. Ideally, you would want to cut back on fat, specifically saturated fats. If you exercise, you would still want 20-35% of healthy fats composing your daily calorie intake.

**Conclusion:**

To be free from GERD, it seems you have to become a Bodhisattva. Free yourself from suffering and the cycle of rebirth and become a real try hard in life, totally flawless. No, but for real though, to summarize, get tested for helicobacter pylori, correct all the anatomical risk factors or finish being pregnant, no smoking, alcohol, coffee, or caffeine ingestion, don't be dependent on any pharmaceutical or drug, no recreational drugs that relax muscles or any intoxicants/intoxicated states, drink only lactose free milk and fat-free or 2% lactose free milk, change the way you breathe, drink lots of water, avoid certain supplements, always sleep on your left side with bed risers, live a life free from stress, exercise every day to work on your posture and stay active, always maintain perfect posture, get to a healthy weight, get tested for PCOS (if you are a female) and treat it, be sure to eat foods high in fiber, non-citrus fruits or foods low in citrus, vegetables, such as dark green leafies, whole grains, ginger, low-fat milk/dairy, plant based proteins, eat only healthy fats, abstain from eating chocolate, spicy foods, fatty or fried foods, and get 8 hours of high quality, uninterrupted sleep every night. Good luck.

1fzdunv,https://www.reddit.com/r/LovedByOCPD/comments/1fzdunv/i_suspect_that_my_partner_has_ocpd/,I suspect that my partner has OCPD,"Hello 👋🏼 

We have been together for 3 years now. It has slowly become more and more difficult. I suspect OCPD (maybe a narcissistic disorder as well/ Asperger but I am writing in this forum to get some opinions about what it could be). I feel that he is obsessed and over critical towards me and my family. My partner first started to obsess about me drinking coffee in the morning. He came up with some explanations, that caffeine is not good for the body and that it is a stress to the body in the morning. I listened but I decided to drink coffee anyway because I wanted to choose for myself, that made him annoyed and critical, he even called me a junkie for drinking coffee. He would give me harsh remarks while I was making coffee in the morning. It was a repetitive behavior that lasted a long time, until he got ""corrected"" by his parents who had witnessed it. They needed to insist over some month before he stopped that. Other than that he was quite nice to be with.

Later, in the summer, he obsessed about  ""health"", like I should train more, not eat much, not gain weight (I am not overweight). He could give me remarks if I took ""the wrong choices"". During holidays in my home country, he was annoyed because of an ""appearant lack of physical activity"" in my family, as well as ""eating too much"" and ""being overmedicated"" (grand parents with some medication). He made comparisons with his family ( that is ""so much better"").
Other problematic topics are : drinking from a plastic bottle, using my phone (or having it available) when he decided that I should't, if I use cream on my face ...
He fixates on microbes and that I have to wash my hands (even my face sometimes) when I have been outside. I wash my hands when I come home, as an habit, and even before meeting him. He washes his hands as well. He uses tons of paper to avoid directly touching things that he thinks are dirty. But what is problematic for me is that he tells me to do it upon arrival, or he asks me if I have washed my hands. Or he wants that I wash my hands on command in the shop for example. 
It  was an episode where he got angry because I touched a door handle at an eating place, on the way out. Then he yelled and called me ""unhygienic""... I got a lecture on why I got COVID, because I was unhygienic...

He regularly criticizes me, saying that I'm making ""the wrong choices"". 
I gave birth 5 month ago, and he is on my back because he wants that I go training. I fully breastfeed and I am slimmer than before pregnancy, but no, he criticizes me because I have not gone much to training, and that I show a clear lack of ability to maintain physical and mental health.
He criticizes that I don't clean enough (according to him), my "" obvious lack of planning"" ( he wants I tell him what I plan for dinner when he is still at work). He has always something to say. If he finds something that needs to be cleaned, he either tells me to clean, or he cleans but tells me that I should clean as well. I feel like he doesn't see all what I do, but focuses on what needs to be done, and criticizes me if something needs cleaning.  

The other day, I was wearing a jacket in fleece while breastfeeding, and guess what: he started to criticize me for that, he even said that the fact that I was wearing this jacket made him disgusted in me, that I was taking the wrong choices... He was afraid that wearing this jacket was not the best choice while breastfeeding a baby ( because of microplastics contained in the fleece). 
I have a lot of other examples. The pattern is that he gets a hangup and then he wants to impose his standard to me. And then I feel he is abusive, he can yell sometimes, he talks bad to me, because he wants I do things his way. 
When I try to confront him about his behavior, he turns the blame back to me, saying that I am difficult, that he can't live with me if I don't do this or that, that I choose to focus on the problems. He tells me that I focus my mind on the wrong topics, that I am negative, he yells, gets agressive. He even qualified me as "" unfit to be in a relationship with"".
I told him that he might need to talk to a professional because I don't think his behavior over his fixations is OK. We even have been to counseling ( that he stopped after a couple off sessions). I managed to talk about the hand washing, and he was advised to seek help for possible obsessive compulsive disorders. But he doesn't see the problem. He thinks he doesn't have a problem, and that I am the problem. 
He has a strong need to be right in many aspects on our relationship. 

I am thinking about our baby. I don't want that his behavior affect her. Before I got pregnant, his behavior was manageable, but since, it has escalated. He is easily angry and verbally abusive. It is difficult to discuss things with him. I was stupid to think that I could help him ( when it started with the coffee) but I see that he doesn't think he has a problem. I see that he gets fixated and stubborn, but he thinks that he only worries and shoes that he cares. It infuriates me. Because I think that he cannot understand that his behavior is problematic and that he becomes abusive. He shifts the blame towards me. 
I don't know how to convince him to seek help.  The best for me would be to leave him but it is not that simple. I think it will happen eventually because I have more than enough but I am afraid of a shared custody for our kid. I am afraid that he will behave the same with our kid in some years.

The problem is posting.

Reddit is a porn haven for sure, but you can block that out. You can block out the anti-social subs and set time limit restrictions and all that.

For me, what drags me in is the posting because, Cal Newport talks about this, once you post you've opened a feedback loop. You need to see the reply and the follow up and then you get mad at u/dIcKsUCkERxxx88 for some troll crap and now your day is ruined.

I've said a lot on this sub that Reddit is super useful for fixing a door hinge or finding the right coffee machine or pictures of cats in trees, it's also super good at trolling and bad stuff.

I just had a surgery so I've been on reddit way more in the past 2 weeks than 2 years but the more I find myself posting the worse I know I'm getting. I'll nuke this account soon and start over (I do that every 6 months or so) but posting is the first step to overusing Reddit.",4,1728430329.0,digitalminimalism,3,1.0,False

To create this list of the best granite sealants, we conducted an extensive review of popular opinions and recommendations found in various online discussions, particularly within Reddit-specific forums and groups dedicated to home maintenance and improvement. Additionally, we analyzed bestseller lists to identify products that consistently receive high ratings and customer satisfaction.

4. **Drying Time:** Some sealants may require longer drying times, which could be a factor if you're in a hurry to complete your project.

5. **Safety and Environmental Concerns:** Look for water-based or low-VOC options if you're concerned about odors and chemicals, especially in kitchen areas.

Diagnosis: Type 3 (aka type 1&2) renal tubular acidosis that magically went away around age 9. 

Treatment: 20-25 sodium bicarbonate tablets daily 

Oral routine: Brush 2x daily w/fluoride toothpaste. Tongue scrape 2x daily. Floss 1x nightly. I wasn't as regimented with flossing before but I have been for at least a year now. 

From infancy to age 9ish I had type 3 renal tubular acidosis which decided to go away without explanation. First cavity was at age 1. Since then I get cavities almost every time I go to a dentist. This time I have 9 total, admittedly I haven't been in about a year and a half because of personal reasons but I kept up with my oral care.

I don't eat much sugar. My a1c is borderline too low and my blood glucose is usually 60. I don't rinse after brushing and if I drink after brushing at night it's water. I dont gargle battery acid. My parents and siblings rarely get cavities.

The only thing I do is drink coffee, tea, and yerba mate but my dentist says I don't show signs of acid corrosion and seems to think it's genetic.

1fzdh5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRenting/comments/1fzdh5m/please_stay_away_from_701_eglinton_ave_west/,Please stay away from 701 Eglinton Ave West,"Hi r/TorontoRenting,

I wanted to share a public service announcement about a building that weighs heavily on my heart for all the wrong reasons. It’s concerning that any past reviews for this building and nearby properties seem to have vanished. This is about Shaughnessy Properties, and I suspect they might be involved in this removal (see this thread: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRenting/comments/1bdtl74/rentitornot_and_bedbugregistry_are_gone/)). Guess what Shaughnessy, good luck removing this Reddit post. Money won't work here. 

**The building is infested with roaches, mice, and bed bugs—a trifecta of problems.** The walls are paper-thin, and management is friendly until you sign the lease. If you value your peace of mind, I strongly advise against renting here.

This company bought a once-affordable building, made some deceptive renovations, and then significantly increased the rent. They’ve merely covered up decades of underlying issues. If you doubt my claims, take a walk through the basement. Check out the garage—there are roach carcasses and live roaches scurrying around.

I’m an incredibly clean person—neat-freak levels. I tried everything to keep my space pest-free. My bedroom was my only reprieve until one day I found tiny, bedbug-sized baby roaches crawling in my sheets, likely from the laundry mat downstairs.

There’s a reason they’re offering months of free rent. This building has a HIGH turnover rate and is known among real estate agents as ""that white building.""

Living here was an absolute nightmare. As someone who grew up in Parkdale, in a slumlord building, I can confidently say this place is worse than the 90s slumlord experience. Imagine waking up to enjoy a pot of coffee, only to see roaches enjoying a drink first. Picture listening to your neighbors’ conversations, uninvited, word for word. It feels like you’re being surveilled by insects and people.

Stay safe and informed!

1fzdf92,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1fzdf92/advice_needed/,Advice needed ,"I need some advice about a confusing situation with a girl I’ve been seeing from work. 
We work different shifts and departments, but she invited me over twice, and both times we ended up having sex. The first time, we spent a few hours together, and the second time I stayed the night. We had sex again, at night and and in the morning too, then we got coffee. Everything seemed perfect, but after she went to a wedding, things changed. I told her I missed her, and she responded that we’re not on the same page and that she’s only looking for friendship.

After that, the next time we worked together, I texted her to meet before her shift in the parking lot, but she didn’t reply. I drove around and saw her, so I went up to say hi. She apologized, saying she’d just seen my text (which I knew wasn’t true), but she hugged me and I kissed her. Later that day, I texted her again, and she responded with, “Good morning. I’m sorry, but I don’t think you understood me the other day. I don’t have the same feelings you do. And the fact that you stayed after work yesterday and came over to me without me saying anything... that's too much.”

I’m really confused. Things were so great in the beginning, but now she seems completely distant and even uncomfortable. How do I move forward from here without making things worse? Should I just back off and let things go, or is there something I’m missing? Any advice would help. Thanks.",1,1728429127.0,datingadvice,2,1.0,False

He is an amazing guy. He is probably the best guy I have ever been with and treats me very well. We have lived together for two years. I really do care about him and I do love him. But the past month or so I have been thinking about our relationship a lot and I am just so unsure if he is the one. I feel so guilty for feeling this way but I really do. 
 
I feel as though I am in too deep. His family loves me. My family loves him. We have a dog. 

I also recently reconnected with someone I was on and off with all through college and afterward. We always had a complicated relationship. We just got coffee and caught up - it was harmless. But I have been thinking about him a lot and I feel as though we never got a real shot. I feel like now we actually could give it a real shot. But there is no guarantee it will work out. But my gut is telling me to go for it. I really do miss him and always wonder what could have been. I think I will always have feelings for him. I was so in love with him and always wished for a future with him. I know he feels the same about me, but he did treat me poorly in the past. But this was my first time seeing him in 4 years and we have both grown up immensely. I know we could have stayed and talked for hours. 

The issue is I am in a relationship with someone who I do love and care about very much. I do not want to hurt him, or his family. But I worry about being unhappy or unsatisfied later in life if I stay with him. I was feeling this way before reconnecting with the person from my past, and now the feelings are even stronger. I am so unsure of what to do. My heart and head are both so conflicted and I feel so guilty for feeling like this. Please I need advice. How should I handle this situation?

While I was reading, I noticed a very handsome guy who was sitting by himself. I didn't know what to do and eventually decided to give him a note with my contact details as I was leaving the coffee shop. On the note, I wrote: 'Hey, you seem cute to me. If you want, feel free to message me on Instagram. Here's my name: \[My Name\].' When I handed him the note, he had a very surprised and positive expression on his face. I quickly left and about 2 minutes later, I immediately got a notification on Instagram that he followed me and sent me a message. He wrote: 'heyyy, i'm so happy that you just did this! That was very cute and it absolutely made my day, but I have a girlfriend 😅.' I replied with: 'Oh, I totally understand. Of course, I didn’t know :)' and he responded with: 'no worries!! I know it takes courage, I respect you a lot for it :)'

Then I texted him: 'how was your day?' and he left me on delivered for days. I saw today that he read the message but didn't reply. I thought we could at least be friends. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to mess with anyone's relationship. It's just confusing that he reached out to me only to ghost me afterwards

I feel really shitty right now and would like to know what you think of this. I know this sounds stupid but do you think he didn't reply to my text because he thinks I'm ugly? and unattractive? is this most likely because of my looks? Or is it because he is taken?

Most days I like to walk her to the park and then to get coffee and I let her lay outside the coffee shop for about 20-30 minutes and then we walk home. The outing itself is probably around 1-2 hours but the actual walk is not very intense because I slow to her speed. It is around a 2 mile walk, give or take.

She does not pant nor does she get excessively tired although she might misbehave a little or get zooms after a long outing as we near home (because I think she's excited or a little cranky).",1,1728428694.0,puppy101,1,1.0,False

In terms of appearance, I'm of average height at around 5'10"". I'm bald but naturally blond with a stylish beard. You'll often find me rocking black band shirts and comfy sweatshirts. If you're into a laid-back and alternative aesthetic, we might just hit it off! Here are multiple pictures of me: https://imgur.com/a/mA06N8G

When I'm not immersed in a game or exploring extreme metal music (mostly Black Metal), I enjoy the company of my friends. Together, we go on camping trips, visit museums, get dinner or treats, watch movies, play board games, and hang out. We've also visited the Renaissance faire a couple of times. I used to play music with friends as a vocalist. Recently, I've been having movie nights with one of my best friends, enjoying new movies and showing him some he's never seen.

I've also been hanging out at my local game store recently. I met a bunch of cool people there, and I enjoy playing TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh. I used to play Pokémon, but not as much anymore. Recently, I've also gotten into building model kits. Outside of the game store, I'm trying some language learning, こんにちは. I would love to play D&D, but I don't quite have the time or people, unfortunately. One of my best friend's girlfriends has expressed interest, so don't be afraid to be nerdy with us.

Professionally, I am an IT Tech. I just started at a new place, and I've been learning new things and getting along great with all my coworkers. Academically, I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. I'm a laid-back individual who doesn't partake in drugs or party scenes (yes, I even abstain from coffee!). I don't drink alcohol either, but I don't mind if you do. My friends have beers while I'm around. Apparently, I have an INTJ personality type. I maintain a positive and lighthearted atmosphere, constantly cracking jokes with my close-knit group of friends.

In terms of my ideal partner, I'm looking for someone around the ages of 18 and 25, preferably of East Asian or Caucasian descent. As someone who's reasonably skinny, I am also looking for someone who is slim, fit, or petite. I'm not the biggest fan of tattoos or piercings either, but that's not always a dealbreaker, so don't let that completely deter you.

There was some interest there from other SF women who were either pregnant or wanting to be parents. My newborn is a toddler now so I decided to update the diary with a focus on my week. I'll briefly go over the updated finances again, but not the history etc.

My partner, A, and I are both in our 30s and are toddler parents. We live in San Francisco, CA. I'm dealing with a looming deadline this week, my toddler started daycare last week, and I'm navigating all of the feels.

I stole this formatting from . Loving the little splash of color! I'll also only talk about my Money situation, not A's.

❤️ **Section 1: Income**

***Yearly Income:*** I make about $750k a year. My partner is also compensated well, but I'm not going to discuss his finances here. Both of us are staff level computer engineers.

***Income Progression:*** Started with a student job of $7.5/hour. First job out of university was $70k/year. Now I make about $750k/year. Some of this is stock run up. A lot of it is being at the right place at the right time. Being smart and hardworking are only the tickets to entry. I have experience in niche skillset that hard to learn for a variety of reasons - and I'm being compensated for it. 

❤️ **Section 2: Assets and Debt**

**Total Net Worth: $2,500,000** (around there, depending) I was an early employee at a start-up that IPO'd. A has similar net worth.

**Checking Account Balance:** **max** **$10500 min $5000** Most comes from me. Some from A's paycheck. A's salary is lower than mine. When we got married, we created a budget and put that amount in our joint checking account directly from the paycheck. Rest is invested.

Fun money comes from the joint account too.

**Vacation Budget:** We have allocated 50k each year towards vacations. Last few years we've been using this to fly our parents (in their 60s and 70s) to visit us from back home. Travel is about 24hrs so we now buy them business class tix. Occasionally we can grab something using airline miles etc which is nice.

**Mortgage:** We are currently renting where we live.

❤️ **Section 3: Expenses**

**Rent:** **$3,800**. We currently rent a single family home. We've run the numbers (like Ramit always says) and we don't want the burden of a mortgage just yet. However, it is on the cards closer to when toddler needs public school.

**Daycare: $2350** I've been on the waitlist for this since I knew I was pregnant. This daycare knew about my pregnancy before my family. I can walk my kid there. We know several families in the neighborhood that send their kids there, and all the parents love all the teachers. I've not heard anyone say anything truly ridiculous. So far, our experience has been positive.

**Childcare: $1500** In the evenings, I'm still calling my nanny for a few hours. My toddler loves her, we love her, and she's still looking for another job. I'm dreading the day she'll stop coming.

**Personal Trainer: $1200** A trainer comes home 3x/week and I train with him. He's the reason I feel human in my body now. He's the reason I can play with my child without needing to take a nap right after.

**Debt Payments:** $**800** We got a new car. We ended up having to sell our old car. We'll likely soon need a second car, but for now we have just the one car payment.

**401(k):** We max out our 401(k).

**HSA/FSA**: I contribute the full $3,050 this year towards FSA because healthcare isn't cheap in this country!

**FSA Dependent Care:** $5,000 towards childcare expenses, tax free. We now use this funds for toddler's daycare expenses.

**Electric/Gas: $400** Big House. Greedy corporations. 

**Internet: $40**

**Drinking Water: $35 -** We get drinking water delivered alternate week.

**Cellphone: $40** We both got new iPhones recently. We have some friends that get employee discounts at Apple. Since they need to buy the phone for us in order to get the employee discount, it's too much effort to have it on a payment plan. So this is just the network.

**Subscriptions:Monthly:** **$2.99** Apple data, **$13** Peloton; we have a few free subscriptions like peacock, Disney, Hulu etc through various credit cards and service providers. We now have a Netflix subscription! **$22.99** **Annual: $795** Amex Plat **$295** Amex Gold. A has a couple of chase cards that I'm not including here, but it comes out of the joint account.

**Car Payment and Insurance: $920** 

**Medical/Therapy: $50** for monthly deductions from our paychecks

**House cleaner: $220**. They come once a month and deep clean the house. The baby is extremely tiny and we want to minimize the number of people who come in contact with him. Once he's had more of his vaccine shots, we plan to call the cleaners more often.

**Gardners: $70.** They come about once every three weeks or so, and charge $50 each time they come. They do an average job, but they get the work done so that we can use the yard on good days.

❤️ **Section 4: Money Diary**

We're both working, and managing the dropoff/pickups. A is recovering from a surgery which means most of the physical toddler tasks fall to me right now.

✨**DAY 1: SATURDAY✨**

**7:00 am:** I wake up to the alarm, and not my toddler's songs. My best friend S is visiting from back home today!! He's is a writer and is visiting SF for some writer's retreat. He's booked an Airbnb, but he's going to spend the day with us, and then will stay over later in the week. I'm so excited to show him my new life! I driver to the airport to pick him up

**8:30 am:** No sight of the luggage. I'm circling around because I don't want to get a ticket. I tell him I'll grab a coffee nearby and wait for his bags to show up. Does S want anything? No. Starbucks PSL to go for me. **$7**

**8:45am:** Toddler is awake, and happy. I facetime with A and toddler while I wait. Toddler babbles ""I wuv you."" and I damn near wanted to tell my friend to just Uber home!! I don't think friend would be impressed. I decide to continue waiting.

**9:15 am:** Finally I pick S up. He tells me he's tired and wants to grab a coffee but somewhere other than Starbucks. On the ride he tells me all about his wife, their life together, how they're considering having kids or not having kids. I tell him the same thing all the parents told me when I was deciding: it's hard but I wouldn't trade it for the world. I know it doesn't resonate at all, much like how it didn't resonate for me.

**10:00 am:** We stop by Philz coffee. He grabs a drip and an almond croissant to go. I called A to ask if he wants anything. No. I tried paying for S's coffee, but he wouldn't have it.

**12:30 am**: I put toddler down for his nap. Nanny comes over just after. S, A & I are going for sushi. Nanny will make lunch, do toddler laundry and tidy up after the toddler. Toddler won't be up for another 2 hours or more.

**1:30 pm:** Ramen, sushi, some sake, and the best company a girl could ask for. A and S haven't spent much time together but they get along alright. We talk about S's retreat, the new book he's working on, and our jobs. We tell him some more about the lost sleep, blowouts, and meltdowns. And like all the parents in the world follow it up with ""oh it's the best!"". Like all non-parents he thinks we're lying to him.

**3:00 pm:** We wander into a used bookstore. A and I find some adorable kids books from the '90s. Something about a purring kitten. Toddler is far more likely to shred this than ever read it, but it's too cute to pass up. **$25**

**4:00pm:** We get boba. I treat this time. We talk some more about writing, and reading and quality of books etc. **$50**

**5:00 pm**: We head home. On the way back, we tell him about the places and restaurants he should try. I'm busy sending him a million suggestions. Afterwards, S Ubers to his Airbnb. I secretly hope he'll fall in love with this city and move here. His wife's company is headquartered in Bay Area already!

**5:30 pm**: Garba night!! Those who don't know, look up Navratri. It's an Indian festival that involves dancing. A friend introduced me to it years ago, and this time, I found a bunch of people to go with. A has no interest but I quickly get dressed up and leave. My friends bought passes and I'm meeting them at the venue. I sort of just want to zonk out after the day I've had but who knows when the next chance will be.

**6:30pm**: It's chaos at the venue! The artist is popular, and the venue is poorly managed. It takes us a very long time to park and get inside. Parking is $20 and I end up walking 20 minutes to the venue all dressed up. Passes are $30. I look at all the pretty people, and I feel a little bit like I don't belong but people are super friendly, and keep trying to teach me how to do the Garba. In about 30 mins, I get the hang of it again. **$50**

**7:30 pm:** Nanny leaves. She fed toddler a dinner already. A probably ate dinner in toddler's play area while trying to keep the toddler paws at bay. **$162 (nanny)**

**9:00pm:** This is a lot less fun than usual. It's extremely mismanaged and we keep constantly bumping into people. I nearly toppled a child! We decide to leave. Don't want to wait till the end (which from the tempo of the music I'm told is about to end soon) and jostle with the crowds again. We're all hungry but no one wants to spring for concession stand food. We decide to do Taco Bell takeout. My share was **$23**

**10:30pm:** We all head to my house. Everyone is starving after hours of cardio. We wolf down the food in minutes. Another couple friend got a change of clothes and they're staying over. I love having an actual guest room now! Toddler is asleep and the four of us hangout in our backyard for a bit with some beers. I'm exhausted.

**🌿 DAILY TOTAL: $317.5**

✨ **DAY 2: SUNDAY**✨

**7:15 am:** I wake up to toddler singing songs in his crib. I love these mornings when they happen. I'm still very tired and would love to sleep, but I turn a little and toddler hears it. I hear sing-a-song mummyyyy. Oh my heart!! I get him out of the crib and try to bring him to our bed. LOL. Nope. Now he wants to brush his teeth. Now he wants to read the story book. Now he wants to unplug the fan. Now he want to weigh himself. I try to lie back down and leave him on our bedroom floor. He plays with his toys for a little longer, and then asks for milk.

**8:00 am:** I'm up, coffee in hand & toddler diaper changed. I facetime with my family for a bit. Brother tells me he got a raise! How exciting. He's trying to move in with his partner, so this will be very helpful. I remember that his birthday is coming up. He keeps asking for an Apple Watch as a joke. This year though, I'm thinking of gifting him one. My friends and A wake up soon after.

**9:00 am:** We plan to go hang out at a small community pool. I didn't have any supplies but was able to place a delivery order when I woke up. OJ, champagne, some disposables, and some snacks. I feed the toddler a snack, and off we go. **$65.2**

**9:15 am:** We jump in the pool. It's a warm day and toddler is enjoying himself. He has a strap-on floaty so he's getting confident in the water, but he can't really swim so it's not safe to leave him unattended. A and I decide to skip on the glass of mimosa today. We take turns coming out of the pool for snacks. Friends enjoy themselves and splash around with toddler for a few mins while A and I do a few laps.

**10:30 am:** We get back. I'm bathing the toddler in the master bathroom and the rest of the adults take turns showering in the guest bathroom. A preps some eggs for the toddler. We weren't really hungry. We decide to make some scrambled eggs for all of us. Friend taking on that job right now. Oh thankyou, friend!!

**11:30am:** We all sit down at the table to eat a second breakfast. We break open the alcohol again. It's almost nap time so we pour two glasses for both of us. I get through maybe 2 sips before giving up. Alcohol isn't fun only stressful for me with a toddler involved, and senses blunted. 

**12:30pm:** Toddler goes down for a nap. We clean up. Looks like all the food on the floor. I don't know how much was eaten, if anything. Somehow he's growing and that's enough. I now decide to enjoy my mimosa in the backyard.

**1:30pm:** We decide we aren't hungry enough for lunch but it would be nice to eat a bit. We decide to order one large dominoes pizza. Friends had credit there. $0

**3:00pm**: Friends leave. Toddler wakes up. Another round of diaper change, and feeding later, we're all relaxing in the backyard. (Well, in the way you can ""relax"" with someone that's constantly, inadvertently trying to hurt themself)

**5:00pm**: We take toddler out for a walk. And then stop by at the local school park. While toddler plays on the slides, A and I talk about his work. He tells me he has some simple but mind numbingly boring stuff to get through next week. He's an extremely smart man, in a job he no longer enjoys. I encourage him now and then to look for other opportunities without making him feel any pressure. He's feeling lazy I think and I completely understand him for not wanting to take on the task of looking for a new job right now. 

**7:30pm**: Dinner was smoother than I anticipated. Toddler eats most of what I put on his tray.

**9:00pm**: Toddler goes to bed, and A and I chat a bit about finances, upcoming halloween party we want to plan, Emily In Paris, and next week's schedule. I tell him to put the daycare expenses on a credit card and that I need to get that reimbursed later via FSA Dependent Care. He informs me that he's scheduled cleaners to come next week Tuesday while I'm at work. For a moment, I want to push back - house is fine - just needs some picking up and a quick vacuum - not hundreds of dollars worth of cleaning. But I know what he's going to say - that my time is better spent either relaxing or working or enjoying with family. Not saving what essentially amounts to a rounding error in the budget regardless of how big the number sounds. 

**10:15pm**: Lights out! I'm exhausted!

✨ **DAY 3: MONDAY**✨

**6:50 am:** Toddler wakes up a little mad. I can never tell if he's cold or hot, or hungry? He asks for milk, and I give it to him. He's a little calmer now. He's a little cranky still but he's playing. I get out of bed and bring him to the bathroom with me. I brush both our teeth, and I get ready in my workout clothes. Personal Trainer will be here at 7:30.

**7:25 am:** I strap toddler in his stroller, put some berries in his tray, and push a very small PR on git. Hopefully the tests will all pass by the time I'm done so that I can merge it before the day starts. You will soon see that a large paycheck comes with several long strings attached. 

**7:30am:** I begin my workout with my personal trainer. Trainer asks me to order a pull-up bar. I haven't yet done a full pushup. What makes him think I'm ready for a pull-up? He says I can do ten pushups if I want. I don't believe him. We continue with the planned workout.

**8:10 am:** A is awake, and ready to take over toddler duty. (Sidenote: I usually end up bringing my toddler with me in the mornings to the bathroom while I brush my teeth and use the restroom. A somehow has never thought to. He's an involved and loving dad, and even so, I brush and pee while watching a toddler, but A never has, unless I also happen to be in there.)

**8:30 am:** I take a small break to help A with the diaper change. He's recovering from a shoulder surgery so we don't want him dealing with a wiggly toddler alone. A does everything else: change clothes, wash face, put sunscreen, put shoes. A drops off toddler to daycare. He will eat a breakfast there. PR passed, I merge it.

**8:50 am**: It's supposed to be an hour long workout session but it usually bleeds into the next hour with stretches and small talk. Coach asks me about my quality of sleep, and nutrition. I tell him garba night fucked with my knee a little bit. While it wasn't hurting during the workout today, I can feel the soreness. Coach shows me a few extra stretches, and some more tricks with the foam roller etc. I order the pull-up bar he recommended. **$75**

**9:00 am:** I sit down at my desk. I check the daycare app. Toddler ate most of the breakfast. PR is merged, and I can see the changes have taken effect. Now begins the real work. I am working from home today.

**10:30 am**: A new engineer recently joined our team (also S). She's real good. We're teaming up and working on the same project. She reviews some of the code I wrote and found a few errors that were likely creating major issues downstream but I wasn't able to find/fix. After looking at the same block of code day-after-day, you sort of become blind to it. Pair programming when done right, is an incredibly powerful tool especially for someone like me who has no formal coding training.

**12:00 pm**: This is naptime at daycare and I obsessively start checking the app. A few pics where he's playing with some random toys. I finally see some happiness on his face today! Last week's photos took everything in me to not go and just ""rescue"" my sad, sweet boy. One wet diaper. No sleep update yet. 

**12:23 pm**: He's asleep!!! 

**12:30 pm**: I merge the changes she requested, we review the new output and it looks far more promising! Great start to the week. I eat a little bit and prepare my lunch. I watch Ramit's IWT podcast as I eat in front of my screen. This is also toddler's second week at daycare. I'm obsessively checking the daycare app for photos, updates, and anything really to assure myself that he's fine. He's sleeping right now. Photos of him are all very glum and sad looking. It breaks my heart.

**1:00 pm**: Another colleague has figured out a way to get around some pain points in our infrastructure. I get started by trying to replicate his code for my project.

**2:00 pm:** Ugh he woke up already. I hope he's not upset. I hope the stuffie keeps him company. I miss my boy so much and it's breaking my heart right now that he's not in the house under our watchful care. 

**4:30 pm**: I am able to get some really good momentum going with his code and I skip all of my afternoon meetings. I may be able to wrap this up by end of the day but if I stop, it's going to take very long to restart. I tell my manager as much, and she agrees.

**5:00 pm:** Nanny is here. She preps some dinner for the toddler. A will be home soon with toddler.

**6:30 pm**: I'm very nearly done and I think it's a good point to stop right now. I decide I can come back to it and add the final touches after toddler goes to bed. Toddler will be back soon from the playground. Nanny has already given him one dinner, and will feed and bathe him one more time before she leaves at 8.

I talk to A. He tells me teachers are very happy with toddler. Teachers said he is still adjusting however it's totally normal that he's not all smiles all of the time. 

**7:45 pm**: We all finish dinner. A and I ate some left overs. Nanny made some savory pancakes for baby. Toddler threw most of the food on the floor, but looks like ate some. Nanny cleans up after the toddler. She leaves at 8. We play and spend some family time on the floor. 

**8:30 pm**: We begin the nighttime routine for toddler - a bit of milk, bath, brush, one story and then off to fairly land.

**9:15 pm**: I come out of the bedroom after putting toddler to sleep. A has already cleaned up dinner, and loaded the dishwasher. I go to check on my code. Things are working!! I don't think any more changes are needed!! Woah this is huge! We just made massive progress.

**10:00 pm:** Lights out!

**🌿 DAILY TOTAL: $75 (for nanny)**

✨ **DAY 4: TUESDAY** ✨

**7:20am**: Toddler wakes up demanding milk. I listen. Quickly.

**7:30 am:** I start getting ready for work. Toddler is toddling in the bedroom and A is trying to wake up.

**8:15 am:** I'm ready; A changes baby's clothes and diapers and baby is ready.

**8:30 am:** We're all out the door; drop toddler off at daycare in time for breakfast; drop me off at the train station; and A goes to work.

**9:00 am**: I catch the train. I have a list of tech blogs and tech youtube channels I follow. I find an interesting paper Google published a while back about how LLMs are being abused in the wild. The researchers conclude that the most common types of abuses are ones that don't need any sophisticated tech skills.

I saw that some of my colleagues are extremely upto date on the goings on in the industry. I on the other hand, am not. This makes me unable to comment on, or contribute to discussions about how to improve existing infrastructure, new projects to take on, new things to try etc. I decided to get better at it, and asked those I look up to. They pointed me to the publications that they follow regularly. I have decided to read at least one blog or watch at least one tech video on my commute to the office. Good thing is that these are well written, and interesting to read, so it's not as much of a chore.

**9:50 am:** I reach work. I go to the office cafe to grab an iced coffee. It's full of sugar, empty calories, and extremely delicious. I always get it with extra ice. I am trying to maintain a calorie deficit so I usually avoid these, but today I indulge. 

**10:30 am**: I have discovered that plain greek yogurt and sweet cereal is the goat! They have plain greek yogurt and Honey Bunches cereal in my office kitchen. I eat a bowl of those.

**12:30 pm**: There is a cafe downstairs, but I'm a vegetarian and they have a total of two options. It's boring. And I'm trying to maintain a calorie deficit. So I bring with me a Think! Protein bar, a CorePower chocolate milk, and some Quest chips. I munch on those while reviewing some of S's work. I see a particular new keyword there. It's likely a faster process, and at the very least, that makes it much easier to read than how I've been doing it. I comment to her about it, and file it away for later use myself.

**3:30 pm:** After some more coding session with S, some back and forth, and after her complimenting my design skills, I'm satisfied with what I have achieved for the day. I push in the last PR and decide to head home. I'll pick it up once I'm back. We're aiming to finalize this piece by Friday morning. We're meeting with the legal team on Friday afternoon. They need to ok my work before more progress is made. 

**3:45 pm**: I get on the train. I get a spot to sit down and am able to login. PR checks have passed, and I click on that giant green merge button. Ah so satisfying!! I shut off the laptop, and realize I need to buy groceries. We pay for all possible conveniences now so we get WholeFoods deliveries as and when needed. A and I also keep adding things to the cart when they're done. I add a few more items I remember, and place the order. It should be on the front porch by evening. **$83.54**

I begin reading my book. I'm reading ""The Girl Behind the Wall"". I don't want to reach anywhere close to burnout. So I am very careful to keep my hobbies alive. One of those hobby is reading fiction. I'm lately really liking historical fiction.

**5:00 pm**: I reach home, and kick off a few runs with the newly merged PR. I close my laptop for the evening and wait for A and toddler to come back. Nanny has other commitments today so she isn't going to be available. I make peanut butter sauce and dice some tofu for dinner. I throw in some tofu in the airfryer and begin cooking pasta on low heat.

**6:15 pm**: We go for a family walk. This is another ritual  A and I are really fond of, since before I was pregnant. My pregnancy solidified this habit for both of us: no matter A's work situation, and the level of crumminess in my attitude, A made sure he and I went for a walk. Some days I really wanted to kick him instead of walking when I was pregnant. Some days I prayed to all of the Gods that he'd forget about the walk. Nope. We went on a walk unless it was raining outside. I always felt better 10 mins into the walk though, and made sure to tell him that.

The toddler snacks on some chopped strawberries, and airfried tofu on the way so that we can get to dinner time.

**7:30 pm**: Dinnertime. More of the tofu for the toddler, with some cooked noodles without sauce on the side. A and I are eating tofu noddles with peanut butter sauce. Toddler obviously wants the noddles from our bowls. Many messes are made. After some giggles and a meltdown, we wrap up dinner.

**8:30 pm**: Bathtime. Storytime and bedtime. A helps me with bath and diaper today. Toddler is a little extra cranky and I'm not sure I can handle him all by myself.

**9:00 pm**: A reads the story to him and then ducks out. I rock my baby as he asks to ""cheep"" (sleep). I can't help myself; I kiss his cute face a few times and nearly wake him up. Toddler was tired today. Zonked out pretty quickly. A has cleaned up per usual, and loaded the dishwasher.

**10:00 pm**: After watching a little bit of Emily In Paris, I go in my bedroom. I'm slowly working through Ramit's journal. There's decent value there for someone like me who grew up middle class and now needs to stop looking at the price of blueberries!

**🌿 DAILY TOTAL: $83.54**

✨ **DAY 5: WEDNESDAY** ✨

**7:20 am:** My alarm goes off. Personal Trainer will be here at 8. Toddler is peacefully sleeping in the crib. I want to go kiss his cute face a few times without having him wake up.

**7:40 am**: I waddle out of the bed, brush my teeth, use the bathroom and quietly escape out.

**8:00 am**: Trainer tells me we're doing 10 pushups today as my first exercise. He tells me he thinks I can do at least 8 without modifying or stopping. I scoff at him. I start, he corrects my form a little. But I did actually manage to do TEN pushups without modifying!! I ask him thrice if I went low enough? But did my hips dip down? Was I going to slow though? Nope. I did TEN pushups today with the right form!!! Mind = blown! 

**9:15 am:** I come inside. Few strawberries are mushed in the floor. Hopefully a few got inside the mouth. A tells me toddler is ready for dropoff. I strap him in, and drop him off. Meanwhile A gets ready for work.

**10:00 am**: I bring my workout smoothie to my desk and login.

**12:30 pm:** I decide to make a quinoa salad for lunch. It's a slow day today. I've been checking the daycare app all day. I saw one pic of him with a little smirk!! I'm so anxious for him. 

After Monday's progress, I'm just running a few iterations of the same thing to make sure results are replicating, and make sense to me and everyone else. A lot of waiting around - which is extremely welcome respite in an otherwise go-go-go job.

S found a few bugs in a data feed pipeline I had created. She's fixing and testing that. I'll integrate the new data in the evening. 

**4:50 pm**: A and toddler come home. He wants the ""poot poch"" (fruit pouch). We buy ones with little to no added sugar but I don't like him specifically asking for processed foods. This is the 4th time in the last few days he's asked for it. I decide to make a yogurt smoothie for him instead, which he happily finishes.

**5:00 pm**: Nanny comes and preps dinner. She takes over for a bit. She feeds him a little again, then takes him to the playground and then bathes him. I go back to my desk. I've been documenting our work, which will be shared with internal and external stakeholders. S slacks me saying the new data feed is bug free and ready to be integrated. I work on that. 

**6:30 pm:** S and I catch up again at the end of the day. Does she see any problems with my results? She asks me a few clarifying questions, we notice two graphs that don't make much sense. But we ultimately decide that what we're seeing overall makes sense, but needs some more fine tuning. We decide to change directions a little bit. We'll communicate it to our stakeholders tomorrow and make sure new direction isn't introducing new problems for other engineers.

I shut my laptop and A and I go for a walk. We meet a few of our old neighbors. Their kids are older, but we love them! We catch up for a few minutes, make empty promises to grab beers soon, and we leave.

**8:00 pm**: Nanny left. Toddler hates getting in the high chair sometimes. Today is one of those days. He's also cranky. He's having a colossal meltdown and he is twisting his little body in all sorts of ways making it entirely impossible for two adults to get him safely in the high chair and strap him. After a lot of tears, we give up. Let's all eat on the floor on the picnic blanket tonight. He's done with the real dinner, this is pretend dinner

**8:45 pm**: We wrap up and offer him milk. He's not interested. I get the bath going and A grabs all of the supplies: clothes, towels, diaper, wipes. I asked nanny not to bathe baby. He's having a bit of a runny nose and warm bath before bedtime helps him go to sleep. More tears follow when I brush his teeth. I tell myself I did a good job by not giving into his crying, but I seriously doubt I'm actually cleaning his teeth with this pretense of ""brushing"".

**9:15 pm**: He's out.

**10:30 pm**: After talking about our Halloween party plans, and holiday vacation plans, we go to sleep as well. We managed to make the invite list today so that's something. A also got back our passports with approved Schengen visa. The plan is to visit Spain in December.

**🌿 DAILY TOTAL: $75**

✨ **DAY 6: THURSDAY** ✨

**7:00 am:** Toddler wakes me up. Today he's happily cuddling with us after his milk. He's babbling things and even though I'm sleepy, these are the absolute best mornings!

**7:30 pm:** Toddler rolled out of the bed at some point. He's playing with some toys nearby. A and I get up as well. I start getting ready, and A begins to get toddler ready.

**8:00 am:** We drop off toddler in time for a breakfast at the daycare today.

**8:15 am:** I just missed my train and the next one isn't for 18 minutes. We decide to just drive around for the next 12 minutes or so. We talk some more. He tells me his work is picking up again. We listen to each other vent about our managers, and the general emptiness of tech careers. 12 minutes are up, and he drops me off at the train station.

**9:30 am:** I reach the office. I skip the coffee run today, and beeline straight for the yogurt and cereal. The overnight runs are successful. I paste the results to S, and another colleague who has eagle eyes for spotting issues ahead of time. They both say things are overall making sense, except for the one issue S and I noticed last night. 

**12:30 pm**: I decide to skip the cafe and go to Chipotle for lunch. **$15**

I think I found the problem. It's a small code change. I'll decide to kick of a short run to test my theory. Quickly I find that I'm headed in the right direction. I keep pushing.

**6:00 pm:** I make it home. The small problem is fixed, and now S and I just have to put everything together in a neat looking deck with a bow on top. We're ready for tomorrow. 

I change out of the commute clothes and rinse off quickly. Nanny has the toddler. She told me he ate a lot. Is he not eating enough at daycare? Or is it just that he enjoys homemade meals? I make a mental note to talk to the teachers myself about his eating. A has started dinner for us. 

**7:30 pm**: Avocado toasts and tomato soup tonight. I cool the soup down for the toddler and put it in his cup. He mashes and eats the avocados and the bread today. He's more interested in what's on our plate even though it's the EXACT same thing. Nanny is also eating dinner with us tonight. A and I take turns giving him avocados from our plates.

**10:00 pm:** Toddler went to sleep, and I open Ramit's journal again. I ask some of those questions to A. ""If you suddenly had $100k, what would you do with it?"" He playfully says midnight is not the time to ask these questions. Okay well, I had written that it'd take winning a lottery of $100k for me to learn to swim. I hired a swim instructor for just 4 classes, and now I'm a better swimmer, and I didn't actually need $100k for it. I also wrote that I needed a heated pool, but actually the outdoor community pool is perfectly fine after the first 3 minutes of being in it.  

**🌿 DAILY TOTAL: $90 ($75 for Nanny)**

✨ **DAY 7: FRIDAY** ✨

**7:00 am:** Toddler wakes up, and wakes me up. Personal Trainer is coming in an hour so I give the toddler his milk, cuddle with him for a bit and then try to sneak out. He's not having it. I get both of us brushed, and dressed.

**8:00 am:** I power up my laptop and set up the the stroller in the garage. Trainer comes, entertains the toddler once in a while and ... is going to have me to try a negative pull up for the first time. Excuse me sir?? After Wednesday, I decide to trust him. He has me wrap a band around the bar and use that band for support. Jump up, and slowly lower down. I did something resembling jumping up, hanging from a bar and slowly coming down. I'm convinced it must've looked comical, but trainer is very encouraging! He tells me what I did counts as a negative pullup!! I decide to believe him for now. 

**9:00 am:** A took toddler to daycare. 

**10:30am**: Today I shower, and drive to work. The traffic is light on Fridays and driving is easier. I listen to some music on the way.

**11:00am**: I reach the office and twiddle around reddit for a little bit before starting to work. Home stretch here folks! In two hours, we meet with the legal team and then we will officially call ""development"" over. 

**12:53 pm:** Meeting with the legal team got postponed. Ugh! Fine. I have no more motivation. I walk around the campus a little, go sit at the cafe and clear my head. Weekend is coming up. I look at some travel itineraries for Spain, and try to find some easy-to-implement Halloween decor ideas for the rest of the afternoon. 

**1:30 pm:** S and I catch up again. She's done with some work I wanted her to do, and now I take it over. I have built a wrapper to take data from her data sources, and convert them to formats I need. I run those, and then add S's new data sources into the new runs for the weekend. Small change, but I document this for the legal team's review on Monday. 

**4:00pm**: I start driving back. Since I have the car, I'm picking up toddler from daycare.

**5:00pm**: I reach the daycare for pickup. Teachers tell me he's adjusting well. She tells me he's a curious little guy and is trying to communicate. Teacher cannot understand what he's saying yet, but he's persistent and curious. She tells me he's a good boy. I don't tell her that I can't understand him most of the times either. But I'm happy to hear he's loved. I don't particularly love the term ""good"" boy, but I take it to mean that he's usually calm enough to understand the instructions he's given, and follow. That's a win!

I ask her about his food intake. I tell her he seems to come home and eat a house some days. She tells me he's eating well at daycare. Okay. He's a big guy for his age though so hopefully teachers aren't comparing him to others his age. Smaller people just need less food and same is true for kids. Hopefully this is all a part of the adjustment period. 

**6:00pm:** Nanny packed toddler's dinner and we go to the local food festival. There's music, food trucks, and a toy pit for kids. All the parents hover nearby while the kids negotiate which toy to snatch from whom. We grab some falafel sandwiches and watch two 5yo kids snatch a truck from my kid. We continue to watch. He is a little taken aback, but quickly moves on to playing with some other toys. The 5yos probably were told off by their parents and came to return the truck. Now my kid tries to bully these two and tries to snatch their toy. 5yos are amused. They decide to give up their toy too and move on to playing with something else. This is entertaining! **$35.5**

Nanny is also with us. I forgot to tell her ahead of time, and I don't want to cancel her income at the last minute, so we decide to all go. Nanny also grabs a bite for herself. She's watching the toddler for the most part. A and I talk about work. He asks me how the approval meeting went: I tell him it got postponed. He says he isn't surprised. Then we look at this wonderful, amazing, loving human we created. Before the thought is over, he trips and falls. All three of us are within 10ft of him but he hurts himself anyway. Poor baby. After some tears and cuddles, he's playing again. 

**8:00pm**: It gets dark and we head back.

**9:00 pm**: Toddler goes to sleep.

**11:00 pm**: A and I watch some TV and try to plan more of the Halloween party. A creates the invites on Canva and I browse through some potential party themes. We bookmark a tall statue on Costco but don't order anything just yet. We haven't decided on a theme. We crash soon after. This weekend, we plan to finalize a theme and start ordering decor and plan the food. We also want to roughly have an itinerary for Spain. We're both a little nervous traveling with toddler all the way to Europe.

❤️ **Section 5: REFLECTION**

1. Overall, I wish my life had a little more room. Since toddler started daycare, I see him much less than usual. When he was home, I used to go say hi to him every 30 to 45 minutes. It seemed like nothing, but it was everything. 
2. Toddler has been in the daycare for a bit. So far, other than a runny nose, no serious illness. I expected his tears, and his adjustment period, and sickness etc. What I didn't expect was all of the feelings I am feeling about this. The first day I went into the office after his daycare started, I was so mopey. I'm pretty sure my colleagues thought I was dealing with a personal tragedy of some sort. 
3. I'm endlessly amazed at the talent of engineers around me. Regardless of that, more often than not, the work we all do seems meaningless and vain. Being an engineer in Silicon Valley has it's perks obviously, but a large drawback no one mentions is the vast emptiness it leaves.
4. Having the privilege to hire a personal trainer has been a huge unlock. I can see that frustration is slower to build up in my body, and easier to shake off. ",2,1728428563.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,14,0.55,False
1fzd7oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BatteryGurus/comments/1fzd7oc/what_open_ais_dev_day_2024_had_for_smartconnected/,What Open AI's Dev Day 2024 had for smart/connected batteries,"OpenAI slashed its API rates like a retail store clearing out the last of its Halloween candy in November. What does that mean for the big, booming, and *sometimes* buzzing world of smart batteries, virtual power plants (VPPs), and distributed energy storage systems (DESS)? Well, buckle up, because it’s like someone just added an extra layer of insulation to your home during winter—more power, less cost!

First off, let’s talk smart batteries. You know, the ones that aren't just there to hold energy but have a personality—predicting demand, balancing loads, and sometimes feeling like the Tesla of battery packs. With OpenAI’s API *rate cuts*, developers of these smart systems can now afford to have their batteries ""chat"" even more. Imagine: your battery, now with a constant AI companion, analyzing patterns, weather forecasts, and even your fridge’s energy usage while still having enough juice left for a “Hey, how was your day?” at the end of it. It’s like turning your battery into a power-hungry therapist, except this one *saves* you money instead of charging you for every session.

Now, let’s charge up to Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). These are the orchestras of the energy world—conducting thousands of energy sources to hit the perfect, harmonious note of balance. 
Cheaper APIs mean AI gets to be the conductor, and it’s no longer a part-time gig. With these reduced rates, VPPs can afford to bring in AI like a full-time maestro, scaling coordination and optimization efforts like they’re running an energy version of a flash mob. 
Cheaper tools mean more power flowing efficiently, and suddenly, VPPs start looking like they could outperform traditional power plants, minus the pollution and the dinosaur fossils.

Finally, DERS—the Distributed Energy Resources. Or as I like to call them, the neighborhood energy hipsters. They’re already the rebels, saying “no” to centralized energy like someone rejecting a corporate coffee chain. 
With these rate cuts of API, their rebellious streak just got a tech upgrade. Now, AIs managing these systems can analyze each panel’s output, predict peak times, and optimize like they’re playing the stock market, except it's clean energy they’re trading instead of corporate stocks. It’s like turning every suburban solar panel into a mini energy influencer, knowing exactly when and where to sell that sweet, sweet solar energy.

So, OpenAI’s announcements are like pouring rocket fuel (eco-friendly, of course) into the growth of smart batteries, VPPs, and DESS. Suddenly, energy management isn’t just smart; it’s hyper-connected, efficient, and—dare I say—more affordable. 

But let’s hope we don’t end up with batteries more intelligent than their owners. After all, it’s all fun and games until your smart battery starts sending you push notifications reminding you to unplug your phone because it’s “bad for its health.”

Puns aside, on a serious note, Which AI approach do you support: Accel (Accelerationist AI) for rapid progress or Decel (Decelerationist AI) for cautious development?

1fzd5lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1fzd5lh/gerd_getting_worse_after_ppi_treatment_or_just/,GERD getting worse after PPI treatment? Or just anxiety,"(F20 diagnosed with gastritis and esophagitis through endoscopy) I feel like ever since I got diagnosed and went on PPI treatment (I was given rabeprazole starting from august 24) ive just been feeling worse. I stress out more about my gerd, having heartburn more often, and ended up developing newer symptoms despite a relatively safe diet (got globus after 2 months of having acid reflux). I dont drink caffeine, no spicy food, no citrus, chocolate, barely any dairy.

I dont know if this is just part of the process but, am I just not having a good reaction to the medication im taking? Am I taking too much? I was given 40mg of rabeprazole a day for two months. Ive taken it for a month already, and im on my second week of month 2 which will be my last. I dont know if I should continue with the medication after two months and switch to another, stop ppis entirely NOW + rely on pepcid/gaviscon and a good diet, or if its just all in my head and my anxiety is just making my stomach worse. Whats worse is that my parents are heavily against antidepressants, and im too scared to take them.

  
I got heartburn ONCE which went away overnight in august PRIOR to medication (no other reflux symptoms), after/during my hospital stay I did also have a sore throat for around 1-2 weeks which went away but that was probably from my esophagitis and a flareup from drinking coffee nonstop. Fast forward, I got heartburn THREE TIMES over the span of september and october with one that lasted almost a week, globus which has persisted for 3 weeks, and ive just been stressed over it way more than I did prior to being diagnosed. 

Im at a loss, maybe I should should go to urgent care and ask them for advice, but I wanted to see other peoples experiences with the possibility of someone being similar to me.

Long story short, I was able to pass the CFA L1 well above the MPS with 20 days of studying. I studied for 12+ hours a day (literally was coked out on coffee the entire month). For reference though, I did have a decent background in accounting and finance, so I did have a better foundational understanding of the concepts. I didn’t use any test prep courses besides what was available in the CFA LES. I had access to Fitch, but I found that Fitch dumbed down the material wayyyy too much and the question banks were not representative of the actual questions.


Here’s the takeaways:
1. For financial reporting, it’s honestly a grind and definitely the most difficult for me. It requires a bunch of memorization. I suggest to take your time with this section if possible, and write condensed notes on IFRS/GAAP differences.
2. Alt investments and equity investments were the easiest for me. It’s easy points. Make sure to know these sections.
3. Save Ethics towards the end of your study session/review so that it’s fresh in your mind when u go into the exam. Try to understand the framework, but it ultimately boils down to practice questions (CFA’s qbank is perfect for this).
4. Economics requires you to know foundational concepts. Really try to understand why things work the way do (such as business cycles and interest rates). ChatGPT is a great teacher for this.
5. Fixed income - honestly I didn’t have time for this section and skipped it. I scored really low on this section, like below 50%. Definitely go over this section and memorize how the problems are solved.
6. Derivatives - same as above. Remember how certain problems are solved and formulas.
7. Quant methods - difficult section for me. I honestly didn’t even study it because I didn’t have enough time and it made up a low % of the test. I had a decent background in statistics tho, so I scored well in this section.
8. Corporate issuers - easy. Free points. Go over it.
9. Portfolio management - u gotta memorize a couple things here (ie. Beta, VaR, different biases, etc.). Pretty conceptual section with a couple formulas to know.

Honestly I do not recommend cramming for anyone, but if you left things last minute, just know that it’s possible to pass. Put in the work and good luck.",0,1728428325.0,CFA,2,0.25,False

1fzd2xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1fzd2xj/romantic_connection_confused/,Romantic connection / confused,"Hi! I just was wondering if anyone had any theories on this dating experience i had. I’m just struggling to wrap my head around what happened and I’m feeling down. 

Im a female, 26, and the guy was also 26.

I met a guy on a dating app and we hit it off. We went on a first date and then a second. On the second date, he was saying things like, “I can’t believe we have so much in common,” and “I’ve never felt this attracted to someone after a first date.” We really did seem to align in terms of values, etc, so I was feeling good.

On the third date we went out for drinks and then we slept together. He even asked me to spend the night and I did. A few days went by before I heard from him but I asked if he had still wanted to get together the next weekend. He said yes, and apologized for being busy and not reaching out sooner. He said he was really excited to see me. The fourth date, we played tennis, got coffee and then watched a movie at my place. We hooked up again. Then, he left a little later and agreed we should do something again the following weekend. He texted me when he got home. Then days went by, and I hadn’t heard from him. I was a little nervous there was a shift compared to before but I tried not to worry. I waited about 5 days and then texted him and asked if he was still interested in doing something the following weekend. The next day he responded and basically said that he enjoyed getting to know me but was looking for something longterm and didn’t feel the romantic connection that he was looking for. I responded nicely and then it appears he blocked me. 

I guess I’m just feeling a little down. I felt like there was a good connection and I feel slightly used. I don’t regret hooking up, but I guess I just wish he could’ve recognized this feeling before we did it twice. I also don’t get why he blocked me, since it ended pretty cordially. I didn’t try to argue or anything. Just was wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar or not. I just feel confused a little dumb. I don’t understand what changed.

Also included a shot of the bottom so you can see my errors while ressawing. 

Up next is milling the other wood to make a matching end table. ",5,1728428148.0,woodworking,2,0.86,False

My only 2 relationships lasted over 3 and 2 years each and were initiated by gamer guys who well... were gaming with me. I had a rough breakup a year ago and moved out of our shared home.

Long story short, one of the men of the moving/furniture assembly company caught my eye. He is conventionally really beautiful, over 6ft, someone I considered completely out of my league. But we agreed on a day to deliver my stuff via phone so I got his number. I kept thinking about him for two whole days and told a friend, who suggested I just send him a text, shooting my shot. And so I did and asked him to meet for a coffee date.

We went ice skating instead which was something I had never done before and even tho I had so much fun, I realised how sporty, outgoing and extroverted this man is.

I am afraid to not be ""good"" enough. To bore him. Even tho he even asked to meet up again to grab coffee, I feel like complimenting his looks would come of so shallow. But complimenting his character would praise him for many qualities I do not have. I stumble over my words, I struggle with eye contact because he makes me blush so hard.

He already knows that I do have a ""gaming room"" in my new home and that I enjoy digital art and online pen and paper. Still he wants to meet me again this weekend!

How am I doing this and how can I go about hand holding or even kissing him. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",2,1728427772.0,dating,6,1.0,False
