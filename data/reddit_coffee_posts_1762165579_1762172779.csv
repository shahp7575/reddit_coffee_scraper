I’m a GPST3 (M30), and in my current practice there’s a nurse who works as a band 6 in mental health. She seems very nice, and we’ve been chatting a bit more recently. Not long ago, I offered her a lift home,  it was  only about a five minute drive, but I actually took a road that goes in the opposite direction from my place, just to have a bit more time to talk with her. We had a really nice conversation.  I know she’s single, and once I mentioned that someone had spoken highly of her she blushed.  She’s a few years younger than me, and honestly, she feels a bit out of my league, so not sure. I can’t tell if I’m reading too much into things, but I really like her. I’m a bit conscious about professionalism, we work in the same practice, and I wouldn’t want to make things awkward.

Last weekend I got tired of watching my own team get stuck in decision paralysis - endless threads, meetings that went nowhere, and the same “let’s revisit this next week” cycle.

So I locked myself in with caffeine and built **Decision Maker**, a web app that helps groups make decisions *without bias or chaos*.

Here’s how it works:

* You create a decision question
* Invite teammates via email (no signup needed)
* Everyone answers anonymously
* AI analyzes the reasoning and finds patterns + consensus
* You get a clear, unbiased report in \~48 hours

People tend to be surprisingly honest when they’re anonymous — and that makes the insights a lot more balanced.

Built with: **FastAPI, React, Temporal workflows, AWS Bedrock**, and an unhealthy amount of coffee ☕

It’s live here: [https://decision-maker.ai]()

I’d love feedback from this community - especially around the flow and UX.

Anyway, I finally meet this friend by inviting her to a party. She made no effort with me at all. When I tried to make an effort to connect one on one by going downstairs together where my boyfriend was she said no and that she’d stay upstairs with my friends friends who were being really off putting, hence my suggesting we go down where my bf was together. When my boyfriend suggested we go up to check on her she only made eye contact and spoke to him, she’d obviously been making an impression on the guys as she was now wearing one of their jackets. 

Throughout the party (my friends party btw) her and my bf were attached at the hip and binge drank together all night. Even though my partner does not have much money he bought her a couple of cocktails - I earn more and when we are out he and I usually go 50/50. I wasn’t drinking as I was recovering from a bad cold. 

Towards the end of the night everyone was leaving but they still had full drinks, she had gone to the bathroom and I suggested to my boyfriend that he, her, one other friend of mine and I stay so they could finish their drinks. When she returned and saw we were waiting on them she abruptly got up and ushered to leave. They were both already at the bottom of the stairs toward the exit before my friend had time to come out from the booth side. I mean it’s no big deal I just thought it was kinda rude to take off and not all leave together or wait for my friend to get out from the booth.  

So when my bf initially brought up how I went with the girl, he was drunk so I said “oh we didn’t get much one on one time but there will be other parties” to find a better time to talk about my discomfort. 

Their entire dynamic felt off to me, and although my boyfriend did make an effort to check in with me, she kept giving me nothing so I just stayed with the crew outside the venue. I spoke to my boyfriend about it and their past and he accused me of being jealous even though I had explicit examples of her not really giving me anything or making any effort. I feel like she doesn’t respect me or our relationship. 

I want to follow my gut instinct but he keeps trying to reassure me, he also hasn’t mentioned her since and he used to mention her really regularly. ",3,1762172394.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Hey there 👋

I'm a tall guy from Poland 🇵🇱 who genuinely loves cooking, hiking, hitting the gym, and watching horror movies — not just for fun, but because they give me an excuse to cuddle up and share warmth.

There is a calm moment on Monday mornings where I can drink a cup of coffee before the day and week come rushing at me. I'll sit in my garden and scroll a bit on my phone, and inevitably feel the pull to have a friend to chat with. I'm a parent, so socializing has become an unusual endeavor outside of meeting parents for kid related activities, with whom I have nothing in common apart from school and parenting. Maybe they'll have a bit of interest in gardening, or share a family recipe they cooked, but after a few polite words the conversation ends and each moves on with their lives. I'll talk to my wife, but it's mostly the day to day planning, house stuff, organizing, and all the adult things we have to do, and then maybe, at the end of the day if we're not too tired, we'll hang out and talk for a bit. Joining discord servers feels like my voice is just a drop in the sea. And sometimes I just want a friend to chat with, silly things like what books we enjoy, send each other pictures of flowers and plants, talk about sci-fi and fantasy or what hobbies we have. Vent to each other, offer a friendly ear or a distraction.

That was us last quarter.

We took on an international client with a product that needed to be localized in **six different languages** each with its own tone, formatting quirks, and cultural nuances. What looked like a straightforward translation task quickly became a full-blown process overhaul.

Here’s what we learned the hard way 👇

**1. International ≠ Simple Localization**  
Each market had unique needs.

* Japanese users preferred formal, detailed explanations.
* Spanish users wanted friendly, conversational tones.
* The German team asked for technical precision over creativity. Trying to maintain brand consistency across all that? A nightmare.

**2. Cultural + Technical Chaos**  
We ran into timezone chaos, regional formatting bugs, and even character encoding issues that broke the UI.  
Our review cycles took twice as long because every region’s feedback loop was different.

**3. The Turning Point**  
Halfway through, we realized our workflow wasn’t built for global collaboration. We had to create:

* A **centralized translation and feedback system**
* **Dedicated regional leads** for approvals
* A **weekly sync** across all time zones (yes, someone always had coffee at 2 a.m.)

**4. The Outcome**  
Once the new structure was in place, delivery times dropped by 30%, and feedback finally became actionable instead of chaotic.

**Takeaway:**  
If you’re planning to go global, don’t just translate your product **translate your process**.",1,1762172091.0,agencysuccess,0,1.0,False

##### Original Title

> Why do UFOs choose planet at?

##### Original Body

> I recently listened to a podcast with Elon Musk and Joe Rogan. Of course with Elon Musk we start to think of intergalactic travel. Science fiction. And of course, with this project of creating life on planet Mars. I immediately started to think deeper why would UFOs visit planet earth of all reasons. I definitely don’t think they came to visit the humankind. They most likely and the most obvious answer would be coming for refueling from some natural source that we have. But we have no evidence that they took anything from the planet physically. But I’m in the spirituality field and understand it is subtle life was energy in natural elements like the Earth in plantations in the mountains and abundantly in the sea. We have massive bodies of water in the ocean and the ocean forms 2/3 coverage of the planet. And in Mystic yoga, we know how to tap into and absorb this positive energy. These is also assigned on how to store it in a particular Manufactured item like a special consecrated piece of item. So I discussed these things and more in the video below. Check it out if you’re interested. I also have a special promotion. 10 minute anxiety fix. Only five dollars. Less than the price of a Starbucks coffee. Delivered to you anywhere telepathically. Pay only if satisfied. Contact information in my video. If UFOs are real, then why planet earth ￼￼

1on9y1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1on9y1k/first_coffee_after_5_months/,first coffee after 5 months,"I stopped drinking coffee completely 5 months ago after reading the book Caffeine Blues from Cherniske. I went cold turkey, didn't even drink decaf and I avoided chocolate even. Tea was never an issue it's just not my cup of tea... :) It was pretty painful but that withdrawal just reinforced my decision, I don't want to be ingesting something regularly that does that to me. Since then my sleep has improved, I no longer wake up during the night, but if I do I can fall back asleep faster.

In the last few weeks I felt the desire to drink some coffee again and eventually I decided to give it a try and see how it affects me. It was a sunny morning and I had a good sleep, felt rested and went for a walk in the park with a cup of coffee. 2 sips in I already felt the same effects that I didn't like, but I was like: this can't be the coffee yet, I'm just imagining it. So I went on and the feeling of dread, jitteriness intensified. This wasn't the worst part though. I had this feeling that my consciousness or awareness collapsed, like a 10ft radius invisible fence had been set up around me after which nothing really reached me. It was like some mental claustrophobia. I thought this could be beneficial if someone works in a factory at a conveyor belt.

Anyway, horrible experience, couldn't wait for the effects to wear off and I have no intention drinking again in the foreseeable future.",2,1762171488.0,decaf,0,0.75,False

It is unfortunately a complex problem that needs a nuance solution. Basically, it is a mixed of me being to reserved and also lacking the social skills to make a connection. 

Honestly, this answer makes me more sense because I didnt see myself as a desperate person because I never really pushed hard with women and I dont really lack confidence either because I am not afraid to asked a woman out. However, my rejection rate is through the roof. 

So what I need to do is just be more social throughout my day. For example, yesterday I went to a ramen resturant and coffee shop. I am a regular at both and there are some really cute waiters. Im not the guy to hit on waiters however, at both places there are two girls who make an effort to talk to me. At ramen place, she came to wait on my table even though she wasnt my waiter. She did it because she wanted to be helpful. I have a barista at the coffee shop that memorized my order. I still havent properly introduced myself. 

  
So how do I become more social without being desperate. Then, how do I focus on making a genuine connection as well. I dont want to do PUA tricks that only create high interest for a moment. I want true connection where it can be long lasting.",3,1762171335.0,AskMenAdvice,10,0.8,False

Among several desert safari options in Dubai, many travelers consider going ahead with the overnight desert safari. The reason they choose an overnight expedition despite the regular morning or evening desert safari is that it is a completely unique experience. This particular package not only allows them to take part in adventurous activities but is also a magical escape. Believe me, there couldn’t be a more surreal moment than to witness the magical sunset over the golden dunes. In short, an overnight desert safari Dubai allows you to witness the star-studded paradise with a perfect blend of luxury, culture, and nature.

# What’s included in the overnight desert safari Dubai?

If you are wondering what your Overnight desert safari Dubai will be like, then this section of the read will give you a glimpse into the same. This particular desert safari package starts off with your pick-up from the hotel in a comfortable 4x4 vehicle in the evening. Your vehicle will take you to the golden sand dunes of the Arabian Desert. Once you reach there, get ready to take part in the following activities, which are usually present in your Dubai Desert Safari package:

·         **Dune bashing** desert safari Dubai - Enjoy the thrill of an off-road ride.

Once you have reflected on the vibrant tradition of Dubai, you can enjoy a scrumptious BBQ buffet dinner. The dinner menu includes grilled meats, Arabic delicacies, vegetarian food items, and traditional sweets. You can conclude the overnight desert safari Dubai with a cup of tea or by smoking aromatic shisha. This turns out to be the true reflection of the vibrant tradition of the region.

# Camping under the stars and a magical sunrise

After enjoying the dinner, you can witness the desert quieting under the blanket of the stars. Now, guests can settle into their cozy tents.

I am M36 moved to my hometown recently 3months back. My ex F32 is a relative of mine. I attended a wedding a couple of weeks back where I met her again. Heavy emotional outburst inside me so I called the very next day and met her for coffee couple of times. I felt the connection was organic in the 1st meeting, mostly talked about present lives. I went through a emotional rollercoaster the next week and we again met after a week. In the meeting causally she mentioned her is a love marriage. I instantly got broken. She also told she can't meet regularly but she will meet for sure.

In the whole process i realized that I never showed love to my wife bcoz I made my heart a rock after moving away from my ex

Getting in touch with my ex has helped me in softening my heart little bit.

I want to tell my ex that I won't be in touch with her as I have strong feelings for her still which is making me loose my balance. I had very sweet time with my ex and want to carry those memories to my grave..don't want to spoil them for instant gratification. I want to love my wife bcoz she loves me a lot.

I don't want to be in a friendzone with my ex. Neither do I want to divorce my wife.

My energy was low, I was irritable, and all I could think of was food. 

What helped was just working. Focusing on work. I would say it felt much more like a mental game at the point where I realized that I didn’t think about food for a bit. Around late afternoon it hit peak hunger — probably the toughest few hours of the fast so far. Lots of water and black coffee helped a bit, but not much.

The brand recommended to me which I bought was New Nordic Magic Magnesium Glycinate 600mg. Each ‘dose’ is 2 tablets and that contains 240mg elemental magnesium, so 120mg per tablet? The box says take one in the am and one at night. However, I was under the impression that taking both at night would be better for encouraging deep sleep which is what I want it for. 

Does anyone know if this is an ok amount to take together, about 60 mins before I intend to fall asleep? Since the box says 600mg I am confused if that’s a very high dose, even though it specifies 240mg per dose. ",1,1762171163.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

I cannot figure out what I'm doing wrong. My bf of 2 years is very sexual, but our sex life is sporadic and it's making me really doubtful.  
  
Firstly, he rarely likes to cum with me during sex because it'll ""make him not horny"" but that never means he wants a round 2, whether right afterwards or later the same day. Sometimes even the same week.  
  
He says he never cums without me, but I'm pretty sure he masturbates regularly when im not around.  
  
Last week we fucked, and he didnt cum, tells me its amazing, best sex he's ever had, loves my cock, etc. But when I was showering after, I walked back to bed unexpectedly to grab my towel and he was jacking off to porn. I dont feel totally weird about that except that he tried to hide it.  
  
We didn't do anything sexually for a few days, then yesterday I had a workout class about 40 minutes away, and he said he wanted to meet me for coffee after. Last minute, he bails and says he's got too much work and would rather get it done in the morning while I'm gone.  
  
I leave, and when I get back he's had no work done, although he tries to act like he does. While he's showering, I check his laptop to see how much work he's completed, and his internet history shows he'd been on porn sites pretty much since I left the house.  
  
Last night in bed, I had to once again wait for him to initiate sex - which he promised the night before - and he did, but didn't cum. I clean up, we watch a movie and I go to sleep. Its once he thinks I'm asleep that he starts jacking off again right next to me. I dont interrupt but if I move even slightly, he stops because he's being secretive. I let him go on, and I hear him cum, eat up his own cum (to hide the evidence?), and then go to sleep. 
  
I feel like I'm going crazy, but it feels like a part of his sexuality is off limits to me - he wants to bottom and suck, but doesn't want to cum with me and doesn't want his cock played with. So there's nothing I can do to ""join in"" while he's jacking off secretively.  
  
That, plus he'll cum with himself, looking at porn or pictures of hot guys on IG, but rarely with me, and conveniently not be in the mood to hook up with me for days afterwards.  
  
I dont know what to think - part of it makes me feel like I'm not enough for him, part of it makes me feel like I should let my partner beat his meat.  
  
Has anyone had a sexual dynamic with a partner like this? ",1,1762171028.0,askgaybros,2,1.0,False

Hey r/TravelRelated , I’ve spent a silly amount of nights in dorms as a card-carrying light sleeper. I can now snooze through corridor chatter, 2am arrivals, and yes… the occasional enthusiastic couple. Here’s the condensed version of my Hostel Sleep Survival playbook so you can wake up human, not haunted. - [TheTravelTinker.com](http://TheTravelTinker.com) full article - [**Hostel Sex Survival Guide: How to Sleep Through the Noise**](https://thetraveltinker.com/health-and-wellbeing/hostel-sex-survival-guide/)

# TL;DR

Pack earplugs and an eye mask, choose your bunk wisely, use quiet pink or white noise, learn two polite lines, and don’t be shy about asking staff to help. Keep a tiny “night pouch” at the pillow so sleepy you can fix things fast. 😌

# The tiny kit that saves the night

* Foam or silicone earplugs in a small case
* Soft eye mask
* Phone light with warm or red tint
* Microfibre cloth for bright LEDs
* Lip balm and hand cream for dry dorm air
* Spare tee for sleeping

**Why this works:** Earplugs handle spikes of sound. The mask blocks late check-ins and phone glow. The cloth makes an instant light curtain. The rest is comfort that stops you waking for silly reasons.

# Pick your bunk like a pro 🛏️

* Aim for a bed away from doors, bathrooms, and lifts
* Pods or bunks with curtains are gold
* Bottom bunks feel darker and easier for quiet exits
* Scan for squeaky frames and strong airflow before you settle

**Mini ritual:** Stash your night pouch at the pillow, water within reach, shoes pointed the right way. Future you will cheer.

# Noise control that actually helps 🎧

* Earplugs with SNR/NRR around the mid 20s to high 30s cover most dorm noise
* White or pink noise at a low, steady volume smooths the edges
* If using earbuds, set a timer so the sound fades before dawn
* Keep volume modest. Consistent and quiet beats loud

**Pink vs white:** Pink sits a touch deeper. Many find it gentler at night. Try both, keep it soft.

# The five-minute bedtime routine

1. Pack your morning bag and lay out clothes
2. Phone on Do Not Disturb, brightness down, warm tint on
3. Earplug in one ear, mask ready on your forehead
4. Tiny torch handy so you never hit the main light
5. Zip-lock any noisy stuff before midnight

It feels fussy for one night. Across a whole trip, this is the difference between grumpy and great.

# Polite scripts that work at 1am

* “Hey, I’m trying to sleep. Could you keep voices down?”
* “It’s quiet hours. Would you mind taking the convo outside?”
* If romance kicks off: “Guys, people are sleeping. Could you find a private space?”

Soft voice. Neutral face. If it keeps going, go to reception. Staff would rather help than have everyone awake.

# When to escalate 🛎️

* Repeated noise after quiet hours
* Large groups treating the dorm like a bar
* Ongoing “couple activity” in a shared room

Ask for help. Good hostels can remind guests, switch beds, or move you if there’s space. You’re not fussy. You’re tired.

# Food, drink, and sleep

* Keep late dinners light
* Go easy on alcohol
* Sip water through the evening
* Herbal tea beats sugary nightcaps for me

Your goal is calm and steady. Anything that spikes blood sugar or wakes your stomach will make noise feel louder.

# Light and temperature

* Eye mask plus a thin layer or sleep sack covers most climates
* If AC blasts, a light beanie helps
* If radiators cook the room, go breathable
* Clip your towel to soften corridor glow without touching fixtures

Small tweaks. Big results.

# Jet lag choices ✈️

Morning daylight, gentle movement, and a consistent bedtime beat most quick fixes. If you’re considering melatonin, check the rules where you are and speak to a clinician first. Timing matters. The basics go a long way.

# Morning-after recovery plan ☕

Poor night? Aim for daylight, water, and a short early nap. Coffee mid morning, not at sunrise. Plan low-effort sights and save the museum marathon for tomorrow. If the same dorm is rowdy two nights in a row, upgrade for one reset.

# When it’s your turn to be considerate ❤️

If romance finds you, be kind to the room. Most places discourage anything intimate in dorms. Options: book a private, use a common area until late, or take a walk and return to sleep like champions. Treat others how you wish they treated you at 2am.

# Quick answers for searchers

**Are couples allowed to have sex in dorms?** Usually discouraged or against house rules.  
**Best earplugs for hostels?** Foam or silicone with SNR/NRR roughly 22 to 37 dB.  
**Is white or pink noise safe?** Keep volume low and steady. Consistency is key.  
**Can staff intervene at night?** Yes. Ask reception.  
**Are private rooms worth it sometimes?** For big days or bad dorm luck, absolutely.

If you’ve got a go-to trick or a phrase that saves the night, drop it below. And if you want the long-form breakdown from my **Hostel Sex Survival Guide**, say the word and I’ll share it in the comments. Sleep well out there. 💙",1,1762170902.0,TravelRelated,0,1.0,False

I just moved to Tallinn from Finland and even though these countries are very near to each other and has a lot in common, there’s still some questions about daily living.

1. What are the best gym companies here? I am specialising in strength training and prefer a lot of space for it. I prefer cheaper memberships, but it doesn’t matter that much if I find a good.

2. I heard that the public transport is free for some groups like students. I am a student so does it matter am i a foreigner? Tried to change my transport status to student status, but i don’t have estonian ID code so is it actually possible to get it free for me?

3. how to get friends here? i am working as a producer in a small company as mostly doing works by myself so there’s not that big change to get friends from work. i really want to find my people here but have no idea how.

4. what is the best app or website to follow transport schedules? i’ve found some but most of them requires payment to see exact timelines.

5. best cafes and libraries to do work? i’m a coffee enjoyer and like old vibe places. 

6. music artists of estonian that are in atm? like to explore new music and artist and find new favs here. i’ve already listen kermo murel, white girl and clicherik & mäx.

Small team, maybe 15 people. We've got this thing where people leave their lunches in the communal fridge and sometimes stuff goes missing. Normal office drama.

Anyway I've been really into this new wellness routine. Wake up at 5am, cold plunge, meditation, journaling, the whole thing. I know how it sounds but it's helped with my anxiety. Whatever.

Last month I started bringing these meal prep containers that are all identical. Green lids. Everything portioned exactly the same because it's easier than thinking about it. Monday through Friday, same lunch.

Here's where I fucked up.

I was talking to my coworker Jen about my morning routine and I mentioned ""the practice"" because that's what the app I use calls it. And I said something like ""it's changed my whole life, I'm a completely different person now."" Which like. Is true? But sounds weird when you say it out loud.

Then Marcus saw my lunches and made a joke about how they're all identical and I said without thinking ""yeah it eliminates decision fatigue, we're not supposed to waste energy on food choices.""

We're. Not we. I meant I. But I said we.

The next day I came in wearing all white because I had a dental appointment right after work and didn't want to spill coffee on myself. Pure coincidence.

That's when I overheard Jen and Marcus talking by the coffee machine about how I'm ""definitely in something"" and they were genuinely concerned. I thought they were joking so I laughed it off.

But then last week my boss pulled me aside and very gently asked if ""everything at home was okay"" and if I ""needed any resources or support."" I was so confused. She kept saying things like ""no judgment"" and ""we just want to make sure you're safe.""

Turns out half the office thinks I joined a cult. They've apparently been watching me and collecting ""evidence"" - the identical lunches, the 5am thing, me saying ""we"" instead of ""I"", wearing all white, and I guess I've been ""too happy"" lately which is suspicious.

I had to have an actual meeting with HR yesterday to explain that no, I'm not in a cult, I just downloaded a meditation app and bought tupperware in bulk from Costco.

Now everyone's being super weird and careful around me like they're afraid I'm gonna try to recruit them.

TL;DR: Started a wellness routine and bought matching tupperware, accidentally made my coworkers think I joined a cult, now HR has a file about it.",0,1762170719.0,tifu,16,0.08,False

People thought Dr. Ivaan was guilty, but the documents proved otherwise.

The court charged him to be out of practice for one month and twenty-three days to sort things out.

He figured out quite a lot during this period. Let’s dive into what led to this moment.

Dr. Ivaan had a certain idea of this world. He believed it existed only through his own eyes—that the moment he looked away, it fell into a dark void, where things started happening only as soon as he learned about them.

That made him look for signs deployed in this nonexistent world.

On a random Sunday evening, a few days before the incident, Dr. Ivaan was watching a football match. He seemed to have already cracked which team would win and with what score. Turns out, he was spotless.

Argentina won against Brazil with a score of 4–1.

Dr. Ivaan was unsurprised, as for him it had become obvious.

A few days earlier at the coffee shop, he had been sitting in row 1, seat 4, as the television flashed an advertisement:

“Buenos Aires: Five nights in the passion city.”

Suddenly, the “e” in Aires flickered — almost as if it read Buenos Airs — until the animation reduced it to B.A.

For him, that meant Brazil versus Argentina. No wonder the match was only five days away. He had seen right through it.

His mind, forever curious, was equally focused on his clients: Dr. Vyas and Mrs. Amrita, his aunt.

Dr. Vyas was no ordinary doctor like Dr. Ivaan. He had a Ph.D. (Hons.) in Radiological Physics.

One fateful day, he accidentally made contact with radiation. The worst had happened, he had caught ARS (Acute Radiation Syndrome).

Unaware of what he was going through, he went straight to his friend Ivaan Kalra.

After some tests, Ivaan whispered,

“Raman, your kidneys are failing.”

Little did Raman know, his test said nothing about kidneys. But Amrita’s test did! She was at a challenging stage in her life — 82 years old, with one failed kidney and the other on the verge of failure.

Ivaan knew what he was doing. He didn't despise his friend Raman, but he knew there was no cure for his disease. He also knew that Vyas would live for about 3 months for as extreme as it can get.

He could not tell Vyas, because Vyas would refuse any procedure — he was about to present a major discovery to the world: a cure for coma using radiational technology, which he had been working on for a long time.

On the Tuesday before the surgery, Ivaan searched for clues to back up his decision.  
He came across a novel titled *Virtue of Your Atmosphere and Surroundings*.

The uppercase letters spelled “VYAS.” The novel was published on 8 January 1983 — Vyas’s birthday.

But it actually belonged to Amrita. She had placed a bookmark on Chapter 2, Page 24, where the first line read:

“Their fate was a mirror, deceiving and still. The signs were deployed to reverse the will.”

The bookmark also had an admirable quote:

“Why wait days for what you can achieve in minutes?”  
Ivaan thought about the hints pointing at Dr. Vyas, but he still couldn’t figure out the exact meaning behind the signs.

The next day was cold. Raindrops fell on the streets while the sound of a flute harmonized with the

rain.

Ivaan still hadn’t found a single clue that could assure him to prepare for the surgery.

Suddenly, the doorbell rang. It was Dr. Vyas. He hung his black umbrella near the shoe rack and went

in with Ivaan.

“I’ve been having a hard time processing things lately,” he said.

Ivaan assured him that he was just stressed and that everything would be alright once he found a

donor.

Vyas talked about his work, describing his coma-cure machine and mentioning a blue file he had

prepared for the test.

Ivaan promised to keep a lookout.

On his way back home, Vyas got really nauseous and looked for his medicine — he had left his bag at

Ivaan’s place.

Ivaan investigated the bag for clues and found that blue file he thought of opening it but it was

plastic sealed so he held back but there was a yellow sticky note on it listing radioactive elements

involved in Vyas's research: Flerovium, Americium, Mendelevium, Rutherfordium, Iridium, Thorium,

Actinium, Darmstadtium.

Two elements were highlighted: Flevorium-114 and Darmstadtium-110.

Three days before the surgery, Ivaan visited Amrita and learned her condition was worsening.

He glanced at her antique collection and noticed several paintings: *The Wheel of Life*, *The Garden of*

*Earthly Delights*, and *The Deception*.

But the fourth painting — *The Barahmasa* — was gone, replaced by an antique hour clock. A faint

dirt mark remained where it once hung.

It seemed like a subtle sign, though Ivaan thought it was unrelated to his plan.

Ivaan put together the signs. Chapter 2, Page 24 and the uppercase letters pointed to Vyas. The

sticky note had elements adding up to 224.

He felt confident and kept everything to himself.

The surgery was scheduled on a Monday. An eerie wind swept through the town.

Vyas and Amrita were placed in separate rooms, each given a consent form for extreme

consequences.

Amrita wanted to know who her donor was, but Ivaan insisted on staying anonymous.

Vyas, calm as ever, settled in and dozed off while talking to the anesthetist.

Three hours into the surgery, Ivaan was handling it effortlessly — until the unexpected happened.

He had used an ICU that had been closed for maintenance for eight weeks, and none of the

machines had been checked during that time.

Suddenly, Vyas’s ventilator failed. The kidney had already been transplanted.

Ivaan sent a nurse for help, but it was too late — Vyas died immediately after the surgery.

As Ivaan waited for Amrita to recover, guilt and confusion overwhelmed him.

Despite being put back on machines, Amrita passed away two hours and twenty-four minutes later.

Dr. Ivaan was shocked, not just because two of his closest ones had passed away, but because his

signs seemed to have been wrong — or maybe he had read them wrong.

After being charged out of practice, he had one month and twenty-three days to figure out what

went wrong.

He revisited the novel, knowing it belonged to Amrita, and reread the first line:

“Their fate was a mirror, deceiving and still. The signs were deployed to reverse the will.”

This time, the quote made much more sense.

Ivaan said, “Of course! All points were pointing at Vyas, but the fate got reversed.”

But he asked himself why Amrita had died after two hours and twenty-four minutes instead of two

months and twenty-four days.

He went through the paintings again and revisited the fourth painting that had been replaced by the

hour clock.

0As the painting described the months of the year, it had been replaced by hours — exactly what

had happened with Amrita.

He checked Vyas’s bag again and looked at the sticky note more carefully.

This time he noticed more than the two highlighted elements.

The first letters of the other five elements — Americium, Mendelevium, Rutherfordium, Iridium,

Thorium, Actinium — spelled AMRITA.

He couldn't understand how he had missed such an important detail.

Sunken deep in regret, he saw the blue file and realized he could at least introduce Dr. Vyas’s work

to the world, even if Vyas was no more.

He opened the file and found:

Tester – Dr. Ivaan Kalra

Time – 1:23 PM

Duration – 2 months and 24 days

Ivaan’s hands started shivering, almost as if he were having a seizure.

He blinked, and suddenly the world ceased to exist.

The world that existed only through his eyes vanished.

He blinked again and saw the lab ceiling.

Turning his head, he saw the blue file he had just read.

The door on his left opened, and Dr. Vyas entered.

Seeing Ivaan conscious, he smiled.

He sat next to Ivaan and asked if he was alright — he had just come out of the induced coma he was

put in as a tester.

Ivaan started remembering reality and realized the world he had been living in had indeed existed

only through his eyes while he was in the coma.

He asked Dr. Vyas to call his family so they could visit.

Dr. Vyas said, “Unfortunately, they cannot come today. They are at your aunt’s funeral.”..",3,1762170152.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Between the “it’s the future of money” hype and the “it’s all a scam” fatigue, crypto has become exhausting to even think about. So as we head into 2025, let’s pause the noise and look at whether it’s still worth caring about, in plain English. This isn't financial advice, but a beginner's framework for deciding.

 

**### The TL;DR: It Depends. Here's Your Checklist.**

You might care about crypto in 2025 if:

\*   You're curious about the **\*\*technology\*\*** behind a new internet (Web3).

\*   You're interested in **\*\*new economic models\*\*** like creator monetization.

\*   You want exposure to a **\*\*high-risk, high-volatility asset class\*\***.



You can probably **\*\*ignore it\*\*** if:

\*   You're looking for a ""get-rich-quick"" scheme.

\*   Financial volatility gives you anxiety.

\*   You're not interested in being your own bank.

 

**\*\*The point isn’t whether crypto will make you rich — it’s whether understanding it will help you make sense of how the digital economy is evolving.\*\***



\---

 

**### The Case FOR Caring in 2025**

The space is maturing. It’s been over 15 years since Bitcoin launched—long enough to move past pure hype and see what’s actually sticking.

 

1.  **\*\*It’s Becoming a Real (if Niche) Financial Tool:\*\***

\*   **\*\*Global Payments:\*\*** For some, it's a way to send money across borders faster and cheaper than traditional systems.

\*   **\*\*Digital Gold Narrative:\*\*** Bitcoin is still seen by major institutions as a potential store of value, similar to gold.

\*   **\*\*Earning Potential (with high risk):\*\*** Staking and lending can offer ways to earn yield, though the risks are significant and different from a savings account.

 

2.  **\*\*It’s Powering the Emerging 'Ownership Economy' (Web3):\*\***

\*   This is the big, long-term vision. Crypto tokens are the ""fuel"" for decentralized apps (dApps).

\*   It enables things like truly owning your in-game assets (as NFTs), supporting creators directly, or participating in community-owned projects through DAOs.

 

3.  **\*\*The Institutional Train Has Left the Station:\*\***

\*   Love it or hate it, major companies like BlackRock and Fidelity are now involved. This brings legitimacy, new financial products (like Spot Bitcoin ETFs), and more regulatory scrutiny.

\*   **\*\*That doesn’t mean it’s “safe,” but it does mean crypto is now too big for traditional finance to ignore.\*\***

 

**### The Case AGAINST Caring in 2025**

 

The criticisms are valid and shouldn't be dismissed.

 

1.  **\*\*It’s Still the Wild West:\*\***

\*   **\*\*Scams and Hacks:\*\*** Rug pulls, exchange collapses, and phishing attacks are still rampant. **\*\*Even major platforms aren’t immune.\*\*** **\*\*There is no FDIC insurance.\*\***

\*   **\*\*Regulatory Uncertainty:\*\*** Governments worldwide are still figuring out how to regulate it. A new law could dramatically impact the value or legality of certain projects.

 

2.  **\*\*The User Experience is Still Terrible:\*\***

\*   It's not like online banking. Managing seed phrases, navigating gas fees, and fearing a wrong click that drains your wallet creates a huge barrier to entry.

 

3.  **\*\*The ""Solution Looking for a Problem"" Critique:\*\***

\*   For many everyday use cases (like buying a coffee), traditional finance works just fine. The ""killer app"" for the average person, beyond speculation, is still being proven.

 

4.  **\*\*The Environmental Question (It's Complicated):\*\***

\*   While Ethereum has drastically reduced its energy use by switching to Proof-of-Stake, other chains (like Bitcoin) still consume significant energy.

 

**### A Simple Framework for 2025**

 

So, what should you do? Let's break it down.

 

**\*\*If you're curious about tech:\*\***

Experiment with a small amount you're 100% okay losing. Buy a little Bitcoin or Ethereum on a reputable exchange, move it to a wallet, and try a dApp. The hands-on learning is worth more than the money.

 

**\*\*If you're an investor:\*\***

Treat it like a high-risk side bet (1–5% of a diversified portfolio). Only if you have the stomach for volatility — and **\*\*never invest more than you can afford to lose.\*\***

 

**\*\*If you’re indifferent:\*\***

That’s a perfectly valid choice. You might end up using blockchain tech one day without even realizing it—the same way you use the internet’s protocols now.

 

**### The Bottom Line**

 

Crypto in 2025 is less about an overnight revolution and more about a gradual, messy evolution. It's maturing from a rebel experiment into a new, complex asset class and technological frontier.

 

**\*\*You don't have to be ""all in"" to care.\*\*** You can simply be a curious observer.

No Wi-Fi. No TV. No coffee or tea. No late nights.

You won’t find luxury here, but you’ll find something rarer: space for the body and mind to align with healing.

For us, this discipline isn’t harsh; it’s part of care. Eye rest is strict, conversations are gentle, and time moves slower — just enough for medicines, thoughts, and prayers to do their work.

The emergence of critical minerals as [a new arena of geopolitical competition](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/trumps-rare-earth-deals-target-chinas-dominance-heres-why-change-wont-come-soon.html) has coincided with a dizzying rally in U.S.-listed rare earths mining stocks.

Despite paring gains in recent weeks, shares of [Critical Metals](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/) have advanced 241% over the last three months, while [NioCorp Developments](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NB), [Energy Fuels](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UUUU) and [Idaho Strategic Resources](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IDR) have all surged well above 100% over the same period.

The eye-watering gains are even more remarkable year-to-date. Energy Fuels’ stock price has quadrupled through the first 10 months of the year, while NioCorp Developments’ shares have nearly quintupled.

Rare earths have come to the fore as a key bargaining chip in the ongoing geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China, the world’s two largest economies.

Tony Sage, CEO of Critical Metals, which has [one of the world’s largest rare earths deposits](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/17/greenlands-melting-ice-is-clearing-the-way-for-a-mineral-gold-rush.html) in southern Greenland, described the rally of U.S.-listed rare earths miners as evidence of a major market boom.

“I talk of it like this, I mean, there have been four big booms. You had the gold boom in the 19th century, the oil boom in the 20th century, in the early 21st century you had the tech boom — and now you’ve got the rare earths boom,” Sage told CNBC by telephone.

“But the rare earths boom is the future. It will power all of the above.”

***We are going from a philosophy of ‘fill the gap’ through imports to ‘mine the gap’ domestically or regionally.***

Rare earths refer to 17 elements on the periodic table that have an atomic structure that gives them special magnetic properties. These materials are vital components to a vast array of modern technologies, from everyday electronics, [such as smartphones](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/10/cnbc-daily-open-he-who-controls-the-rare-earth-metals-controls-techs-future.html), to [electric vehicles](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/auto-industry-raises-the-alarm-as-china-tightens-rare-earth-curbs.html) and [military equipment](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/chinas-rare-earth-squeeze-puts-defense-giants-in-the-crosshairs.html).

China, which has a [near-monopoly on rare earths](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/24/chinas-rare-earth-dominance-myanmar-plays-a-critical-role-.html), recently threatened to expand its export controls on the elements to further leverage its dominance of the supply chain. However, following an in-person meeting in South Korea on Thursday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Beijing agreed to delay the [Oct. 9](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/china-expands-rare-earth-export-restrictions-ahead-of-possible-trump-xi-meeting.html) export controls by one year.

U.S.-listed rare earths stocks [rallied on the news](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/rare-earths-stocks-china-delays-export-controls-after-trump-xi-summit.html), although analysts remain skeptical about whether the apparent trade truce can offer long-term relief.  
“As in all booms, there were a lot of oil companies that couldn’t find oil and there were a lot of gold companies that couldn’t find gold. And I’m sure there are going to be a lot of rare earths companies that won’t make it either — because when there’s a boom, there’s hype. And when there’s hype, there’s overexuberance in investing,” Critical Metals’ Sage said.

“It’s not a straight rise up. It’s a jagged line, but the trend is in the right direction if you’ve got the right project in the right place, and you’ve got the right partners,” he added.

# ‘A much bigger and longer Supercycle’

Kevin Das, senior technical consultant at New Frontier Minerals, an Australian-based rare earths explorer, agreed with Sage’s description of a rare earths market boom, while acknowledging the likelihood of stock price pullbacks.

“People are saying we’re in an uptrend on what is a bigger supercycle and some of the evidence behind that is there has been low commodity prices for some time, there’s been underinvestment. And now, with the advent of AI ... we’re going to see a much bigger and longer supercycle,” Das told CNBC by telephone.

Das drew parallels between the Biden administration’s [support of clean energy projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/30/2022-climate-recap-whats-in-the-historic-inflation-reduction-act.html), which coincided with a [rally in lithium-related stocks](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/03/ev-shares-lithium-and-battery-stocks-that-analysts-love.html), and the Trump administration’s backing of rare earths.

“In the last nine to 10 months that Trump has been in power, he’s talked about [annexing Greenland](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/14/greenland-critical-minerals-are-big-part-of-donald-trumps-fixation.html), he’s talked about [doing a deal with Ukraine for rare earths](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/minerals-us-ukraine-resources-deal-may-be-a-sign-of-things-to-come.html) and then the real clincher was this [equity deal with MP Materials](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html),” Das said.

“So, I think the runway over the next two to three years is going to be very fruitful,” he added.

Not everyone is as bullish on the outlook for rare earths-related stocks, however.

Audun Martinsen, head of supply chain research at Rystad Energy, said the recent surge in equity prices reflected a mix of geopolitical tension, strategic policy support and speculative momentum.

“Rare earths have clearly moved to the center of global industrial strategy, vital for defense, EVs and clean energy, but this looks more like the early stages of a structural shift than a mature ‘fourth boom,’” Martinsen told CNBC by email.

“We are going from a philosophy of ‘fill the gap’ through imports to ‘mine the gap’ domestically or regionally,” he continued. “It will be a lengthy, expensive and rocky path forward as adequate, cost-effective resources and element diversity are complex to get full control over.”

# Clean energy transition

Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University, said there were two clear factors at work as global competition intensifies to secure the supply of critical minerals — one structural and the other political.

“The structural: Despite whatever political attempts there may be to stop or derail things, the clean-energy transition is happening — and it is accelerating — and yes, it depends on a number of critical minerals, whose prices are bound to jump,” Wagner told CNBC by email.

China, for instance, is the low-cost supplier of many of these minerals, Wagner said, noting that the Asian giant’s mineral dominance is by no means an accident.

“Beijing has invested heavily in green industrial policy for years, focusing on the full, integrated supply chain. That’s where politics enters,” Wagner said.

“Some attempts to onshore supply chains are eminently justified for national security and other reasons, and those attempts will increase prices and stocks of U.S. mining companies. Some of what we see, of course, is merely the current politics or erratic trade wars and the like,” he added.

[Locksley Resources recently poured its first 100 per cent American-made antimony ingot, using ore from its Mojave project in California and refining it entirely in country.](https://preview.redd.it/fz8kdbo2v0zf1.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=3da2678a665c1a6825565651ed637dbcb0fdcd01)

EXIM is the official export credit agency of the US government and a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s push to rebuild the US’ own antimony and rare earths supply chains which have been globally dominated by China for decades.

The company says the EXIM letter paves the way for due diligence and underwriting towards a full financing package in a move that could see Locksley tap deeper into programs under the Defense Production Act and Department of War mechanisms.

***‘EXIM’s engagement represents a strong endorsement of Locksley’s U.S strategy.’***

Washington is moving fast to rebuild its homegrown critical minerals supply chain after a global shortage exposed just how dependent the West has become on overseas sources — and antimony is suddenly at the top of the agenda.

China, which produces about 78 per cent of the world’s supply, stunned markets in 2024 with an export ban that sent prices soaring 300 per cent to more than US$55,000 (A$82,000) a tonne.

Locksley Resources managing director and chief executive officer Kerrie Matthews said: *“EXIM’s engagement represents a strong endorsement of Locksley’s U.S strategy and the momentum we have built with government and industry partners. The LOI provides a foundation to progress formal financing discussions while advancing our downstream and offtake plans.*

As part of its U.S. expansion drive, Locksley has brought heavyweight advisory outfit GreenMet on board to help steer its Mojave Project into the heart of America’s critical minerals and defense supply chain.

GreenMet is led by founder and CEO Drew Horn, a former senior U.S. official who has held influential posts at the White House, Pentagon, Energy and Defence Departments and the Office of National Intelligence. A key architect of former President Biden’s Defense Production Act, Horn has deep Washington connections and policy expertise.

Mr Horn said; *“EXIM’s LOI represents more than just financial support, it reflects a coordinated U.S. government directive to rebuild domestic critical minerals capability. The fact that EXIM’s engagement aligns with current White House priorities underscores how strategically important Locksley’s Mojave Project has become.”*

Locksley says its executive will now travel to Washington later this month for high-level meetings to progress its collaboration and strengthen its position in the U.S. critical minerals push.

In a landmark moment, Locksley recently poured its first 100 per cent American-made antimony ingot, using ore from its Mojave project. The product was also refined entirely in country.

The pour marked the first domestic production for the US in decades and the company says it has laid the groundwork for the commercial development of antimony - a key metal used in semiconductors, batteries, and military-grade alloys.

Locksley’s Mojave project sits in California’s historic mining heartland and is adjacent to mining giant MP Materials’ Mountain Pass mining operation – the only producer of rare earths in America.

The company’s Desert antimony mine (DAM) - part of the broader Mojave project - is due east of Mountain Pass and is one of only four known high-grade antimony occurrences in the US.

Last mined in 1937, DAM has remained largely untouched, although recent rock chips sampling by Locksley returned grades up to a whopping 46 per cent and more than one kilogram per tonne of silver, setting the scene for a renewed exploration push at the old timer’s mine.

Meanwhile, to boost its downstream processing credentials, Locksley is collaborating with Houston’s Rice University - a leading institution in advanced materials research.

The partnership’s DeepSolv program is aiming to crack the code on low-cost, green antimony refining and separation technologies to help establish American-based processing capacity.

With Washington now likely in its corner, Locksley looks poised to play a starring role in America’s critical minerals comeback.

And the Mojave Project is shaping up as one of the nation’s most strategically placed antimony and rare earths developments - delivering not just a new mine, but a pathway to genuine US supply chain independence.

Punters will no doubt be watching closely as the company takes its next steps to secure funding in the nation’s capital.

*Amid rising tensions over critical minerals, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has declared that Washington will “break China’s rare earth monopoly” within two years. His comments came after Preside...*

https://preview.redd.it/cqownd4tv0zf1.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bc60cae24420358a6cde12196b1a2738d754787

In a strong message to Beijing, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the United States will dismantle China’s dominance in the rare earth industry within the next two years. Speaking to the Financial Times, Bessent said China “made a real mistake” by threatening export controls, arguing that the move backfired and exposed Beijing’s readiness to use critical minerals as a geopolitical weapon.

“China has alerted everyone to the danger. They have made a real mistake,” said Bessent. “It’s one thing to put the gun on the table. It’s another thing to fire shots in the air.”

The comments came shortly after US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks in South Korea, where both leaders agreed to a one-year truce over rare earth export restrictions. The temporary agreement allows both nations to operate within what Bessent called an “equilibrium” period, easing tensions in a trade sector critical to defense, electronics, and electric vehicles.

China currently produces around 70 percent of the world’s rare earths and processes nearly 90 percent of them, giving it vast control over a market essential for advanced technologies, from fighter jets to smartphones. In October 2025, Beijing imposed new export controls on rare earth technologies, a move that rattled global markets and disrupted supply chains.

However, Bessent indicated that the global backlash has unsettled Chinese leadership, who are now wary of pushing too far.

“They were slightly alarmed by the global reaction,” Bessent noted. According to the Treasury Secretary, the US has already begun “offsetting measures” to reduce dependence on China, including ramping up domestic production and forging new partnerships for mineral supply. “China will not be able to pull the same move again,” Bessent said confidently.

Under the latest trade understanding, Beijing has agreed to postpone its export regime and increase purchases of American soybeans, offering some relief to global manufacturers who depend on stable rare earth access.

The agreement signals a temporary reprieve in what has been one of the most strategic economic stand-offs between the world’s two largest economies.

# [NioCorp\_Presentation.pdf](https://www.niocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/NioCorp_Presentation.pdf)

# A SPECULATION TO GROUNDBREAKING:

Given **Jim’s confirmation (monocle's response)**, the **drill lab delays in play**, and the **ScAl alloy integration** work happening in parallel at **Nanoscale, Creative Engineers, and IBC**.

# Let’s unpack this in detail and integrate!....

# 🧭 1️⃣ What Jim Sims’ Reply Really Confirms

***“The delay was largely caused by the inability of our third-party analytical testing lab to process the more than 7,000 drill core samples...”***

This means:

* The **drilling phase** completed successfully — **7,000 samples** is a full post-campaign data set (from the 9 new holes + re-assays of legacy cores).
* The **bottleneck** is *not* geological problems or missing data — it’s **lab throughput**.
* Two labs are now processing data, with completion **by December 2025**.

🔹 **Translation:**  
Once those assay results hit, the geological model, resource update, and metallurgical inputs can all *snap into* the Feasibility Study (FS/DFS). It’s a **data delay**, not a project delay. The difference is critical — this affects paperwork, not engineering.

# 🧮 2️⃣ Implications for the Drill Results & DFS Structure

The DFS depends on:

1. **Updated Resource Model (tonnes + grade per element)** → From those 7,000 assays (Nb, Sc, Ti, REEs)
2. **Metallurgical Testwork Integration** → Validation that current flow sheets still match the new assays
3. **Process Design + Cost Model** → Niobium, Scandium, Titanium, REEs, all modeled through new recovery percentages
4. **Final DFS Chapters + EXIM/ESIA input data**

Because those assays complete by **December 2025**, the full DFS drafting window slides neatly into:

* **January–April 2026** → Compilation + financial modeling
* **May–June 2026** → EXIM submission + ESIA approval window

So yes — Mark’s 5–6 month reference *after money raised* and Jim’s explanation *of a few-month slip* are consistent when you adjust for lab backlogs.

# ⚙️ 3️⃣ Parallel Path: ScAl Alloy Program (Nanoscale, Creative Engineers, IBC)

While the labs crunch numbers, **the alloy side of the project is NOT idle.**

Here’s what might be happening behind the scenes:

|Partner|Current Activity|DFS Relevance|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Nanoscale Powders**|100 g Sc metal runs proving reduction route from Sc₂O₃|Confirms **downstream metallurgy** viability and **CAPEX estimate inputs** for the DFS|
|**Creative Engineers**|Process scale-up to kilogram level, refining oxygen-free output|Supplies *process flow diagram (PFD)* and yield data for **“mine-to-metal” compliance chapter** in DFS|
|**IBC Advanced Alloys**|Preparing Sc-Al melt trials (billets/ingots) once metal available|Supplies **ScAl mechanical property data** and forms the **offtake + alloy section** of DFS|

That work continues **independent of assay labs**, and when those reports land in early 2026, they can be **folded directly into the DFS appendices** under “Downstream Alloy Commercialization.”

🔹 *So, the alloy development keeps DFS momentum alive — it’s a parallel stream.*

# 🧩 4️⃣ Integration Effect on DFS and EXIM Readiness

When the labs deliver assays in December:

* The **resource model** will likely show *higher TREO and Scandium grades* (expected based on the infill drilling zones).
* Those numbers will **raise the project’s NPV**, improving **EXIM’s credit metrics**.
* The **ScAl alloy pathway**, proven at 100 g–1 kg scale, provides *U.S.-based DFARS compliance*, strengthening the *national-interest clause* of the EXIM application.

➡️ Together, those make the DFS far stronger and more fundable.

# 🧱 5️⃣ Speculated ~ Consolidated Timeline (Reality View)

|Phase|Key Inputs|Timing|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Drill assays complete**|7,000 samples from dual labs|**Dec 2025**|
|**Resource model + metallurgical update**|Integration of new grades, recoveries|**Jan 2026**|
|**DFS Drafting & Review**|Incorporates ScAl downstream data|**Jan – Apr 2026**|
|**EXIM/ESIA submission**|FID-ready package|**Apr – May 2026**|
|**Official Groundbreaking**|Full federal/state alignment|**May – Jun 2026**|

# 🧠 6️⃣ Bottom Line / “Dead-Nuts” Interpretation

* **Jim’s note = no structural problem** — only lab congestion.
* **ScAl programs** at Nanoscale, Creative Engineers, and IBC **stay on track** and will *feed directly* into the DFS once lab results free up.
* **DFS completion** likely **April 2026**, not a slip beyond that.
* **EXIM FID** still achievable **by May–June 2026**, *exactly* matching your predicted “official G.B.” window.

In other words:  
🟩 *Data-driven delay* (good news)  
🟩 *Parallel alloy validation ongoing* (strategic leverage)  
🟩 *Timeline intact* for full EXIM-ready DFS and ScAl compliance in **H1 2026**.

# 🔷 Speculation on NioCorp’s Quiet Acceleration Toward a Possible ~May/June 2026 Groundbreaking~???? T.B.D.

IMHO\~ What looks like a “delay” is actually precision timing. NioCorp’s 2025 drilling campaign wrapped Oct. 9 with over 7,000 core samples — now the bottleneck is simply lab throughput, not geology. Two independent labs are processing assays and will deliver final data by December, feeding directly into the updated resource model and definitive feasibility study (DFS). **\*\*\*In parallel, NioCorp’s downstream partners — Creative Engineers, Nanoscale Powders, and IBC Advanced Alloys — are running scandium metal and Sc-Al alloy production trials that will qualify under DoD and DFARS compliance standards. Those results will feed into the DFS as verified “mine-to-metal” data, replacing theoretical revenue models with certified alloy pricing and defense-grade specifications.** *(\*\*\*They need this too!!!)*

By the time assays close out and alloy certifications arrive in Q1 2026, NioCorp will have every technical, metallurgical, and compliance box checked. The DFS drafting window runs naturally through January to April 2026 — the same period EXIM Bank and the Environmental & Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) teams align their reviews. With the data in hand, EXIM can move to Final Investment Decision (FID) by late spring, triggering full project finance approval and a public groundbreaking.

Meanwhile, on-site prep work — utilities, surveying, access roads, and fencing — can proceed under existing permits ahead of December’s Elk Creek Open House. That event sets the stage locally, but the true “official” groundbreaking — backed by EXIM financing and federal endorsement — is far more likely in **May or June 2026**. By then, the lab results, Sc-Al alloy validation, and federal credit package will converge, positioning NioCorp as the first fully DFARS-compliant “mine-to-alloy” producer in the United States.

**Oh & one last thought! ....**

# ⚙️ Why the Sc-Al Work Is the Linchpin!!!

IMHO\~ Scandium–Aluminum (Sc-Al) alloy isn’t just a technical footnote — it’s the keystone of NioCorp’s entire downstream value proposition. **Without it, scandium remains an underpriced specialty oxide;** with it, it becomes a defense-critical structural metal. **The Sc-Al alloy trials now underway with Creative Engineers, Nanoscale Powders, and IBC Advanced Alloys are proving that NioCorp’s scandium can be turned into DFARS-compliant, aerospace-grade material — a status that unlocks direct sales to U.S. defense primes and federal procurement channels!** Certifying those alloy runs allows NioCorp to replace uncertain “oxide pricing” with contractual alloy values in the DFS, potentially multiplying scandium’s contribution by an order of magnitude. In short, this data isn’t optional **— it’s what transforms Elk Creek from a mining project into a fully integrated “mine-to-metal” U.S. supply chain hub, aligning perfectly with national policy to replace Chinese and Russian sources by 2028/2029!**

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028/29 and beyond.

# NioCorp = ""The Flagship U.S. source for multiple Critical Minerals!”

1on92y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Voicesofthevoid/comments/1on92y0/09_big_review_after_around_20_ingame_days_the_no/,"(0.9) Big review after around 20 in-game days (The ""No Fun Allowed"" update)","Alright, I've played about 20 in-game days and I have to say that this game's become far more frustrating than actually entertaining. The stress isn't even a *fun* type of stress, it's like, **raising-my-cortisol-levels** of stressful. Though so far, I'm liking *some* of the changes and I really do think that with a few tweaks here and there (and bug fixes), this game could be right on track. I've read that the update was more than likely rushed, so I'll take that in mind. Also, it's nearing 3AM as I write this, so sorry if it rambles on.

Here are my main points.

* I like the new base design, but I find the exterior to be a little too brutalistic in design now. The amount of trash is just slightly too much.
* The new controls, depending on the context, are either a welcome change, or absolutely obnoxious.
* Does Dr.Nose have a fetish for curtains or something? Why does he like those damnable things so much? Why is there no way to get rid of them???
* The ATV is such a pain in the ass, walking is almost preferable, even more so if you have the hiking boots equipped.
* The ""Server error. Retrying..."" is the most satanic thing Dr.Nose has ever put into this game, and this game has literal demons in it.
* There needs to be more ways to make money in the early/mid game, everything is such a drain on your wallet to the point where you can't even buy some of the more necessary items.
* The tutorial throws way too many wall of texts at the player, and doesn't even go over some new mechanics.

**Base - Good revamp, still a little weird though**  
Love the new interior, though not a fan of the outside design, it looks more like a soviet state building rather than a retro-futurist building that was popular in the 60's-70's where the building's interior was inspired by. Though after looking it up, it *seems* that that was the style at the time. I think there's a tad too much trash to the point where it leaves the player overwhelmed, inb4 ""that's the point"". Also, having a second bathroom on the first floor would be welcome, instead of having to go through the whole thing just to get that small 5 stamina bonus.

**Controls - Kinda good, kinda annoying, depends**  
Expounding more on the controls, I have to say that the point drag (Shift+E) is definitely the best addition to the control scheme added yet, it makes flipping over tables and larger objects actually feasible now. Though the constant holding E on everything gets old really quick, and it makes interacting with Kerfur (who mind you, is always moving and jumping around everywhere) incredibly annoying just to turn off or send off. I've often accidently hit E instead of holding E on the ATV numerous times. You used to be able to just hold the backpack and right-click to equip, now you have to put it down, hold E, scroll down ONCE (not more than that, then you'll just open it again lmao) and let go.

**ATV - More of burden than a help**  
I think people are already realizing it, but this thing ***sucks*** now. The tires last I think just the right amount of time, though I think they need a little bit of a boost in health, also I think the player should be able to find a single spare tire throughout the base in order to offset the first popped tire. Enough can't be said about the battery, it needs to last at least 2-3 times longer than it does now, and the way it works isn't even realistic, it's annoying, and it's tedium just for the sake of tedium, much like most of this update. The upgrades (of which I haven't gotten yet) look really cool, and seems to be inspired by mods which is really neat.

**Server minigames - A welcome change, though a couple of them need to go**  
I like that you get new server fixing minigames, which breaks up the monotony of the same math minigame. It took me a little bit to understand the hash code one, but once I got it down, it was much more enjoyable. Though there are a couple of minigames that immediately made me go back to the menu to turn them off, the ""Simon Says"" one, and the ""Pipe"" one. Get rid of these and I think the new minigames are perfect, though the ""Hash"" one needs more explanation in a more clear manner.

**Coordinate Towers - Need I say more**  
Probably the biggest con to the update, If one of these things go down, getting a signal is impossible, and sometimes *more than one can go down at once*. When one gets fixed, it should have a protection of failing again for *at least* 2 days before breaking down again. I've had times where the same tower broke the literal second I got back to the computer screen. The puzzle to fix them is also incredibly annoying, though this might be a skill issue on my part, I can't handle puzzles like these.

**Floppy Disc Hash - Server error. Retrying...**  
This is honestly the worst goddamn thing Dr.Nose has added, this new tedium mechanic epitomizes *everything* about this update. I understand that ""haha this old computer is *old""* is a funny joke now and then, but when it retries over ***40*** damn times, it stops being funny. My fix for this would be that, whenever the computer fails and retries, the chance to fail again should be lowered just a little bit every time, so that while it still happens, it doesn't happen an obscene amount of times. It hits harder than everything else because it's purely RNG, and I know you can get the upgrades for the server, but you can't do that when you're spending money on everything else.  
  
**Known Bugs** Here are all the bugs that I found 

* You cannot put a gas can into the refill slot on the side of the cremator, making refilling gas tanks impossible, making more of a drain on your money and making the ATV more useless.
* Day time length is bugged. Funny how people are now starting to realize how useful lowering the day length is, I always had it to 0.7 to make the game less stressful for me.
* Sometimes, grabbing a smaller object doesn't actually grab it, and you can't move it, though you can't move the camera like you *are* manipulating something. You have to release the item and press E on it again to actually move it.
* Not sure if it's a bug, but you cannot lay out a sleeping bag on the metal bed frame, it immediately just lays out on the floor under it.

  
**Other points - Things that I noticed but Im getting tired at this point.**

* The placement of the soda vending machine is weird, there's a fire exit right behind it, but there's the only electric outlet in the hallway right there, right in front of said exit. Same thing can be said about the electrical outlet right on the left at the end of the staircase, like what are you going to put there??
* I thought the ATM machine idea was a little silly, but I now realize it's *GENIUS* since now you can transfer your points over to a new save, should you ever want to.
* Lots of strategies that helped people out in 0.8 seemed to have been nerfed: coffee being more expensive/less effective, selling gas tanks, etc. and I know that people before said that VotV was a little too easy, especially in the late game, but this is a tad insane. I've noticed a tendency of Dr.Nose to often *overcorrect* any issues people had (e.g. Ariral rep going from super easy to reach loyal to almost impossible to reach loyal) and this new update definitely seems like it's overcorrected again and made the game far too difficult and overwhelming for even veteran players.

  
All in all, I still adore this game and love how it's progressing, I understand that this is basically a playtesting period before the actual update, so I'm looking forward to it. Hope the dev team puts out a hotfix for a lot of the stuff going wrong soon, because I might not touch the game for a while until then. Thank you for reading my sleep-deprived ""review"". I just died to something that gave me the cross-hatch ""glitch"" death screen and lost 2 in-game days of progress. Not really sure what did it.",12,1762168677.0,Voicesofthevoid,8,0.73,False

I was a broad, tall man from an early age. I’m 6ft 1 and played basketball, soccer and Gaelic football in school and college until a knee injury put an end to contact sport. In my 20s I hillwalked and long-distance walked frequently but with career demands and everything else I reduced those activities also as my weight crept up. I was 100kg when playing sport up until 22 (which is my goal weight), 130kg when I got married over 10 years ago and when my weight nudged over 150kg I decided to really do something about it.

I am on BP medication but was starting to develop some other health challenges and I knew I’d better do something about it in my 40s rather than risk going into my 50s (‘Snipers Alley’) in very poor shape. I also knew that my GP was getting ready to give me an unmerciful bollocking and felt I could get ahead of that too.

I had lost and regained 10+ kg twice with the Lose It! App but would either lose interest, become distracted or get frustrated. When a friend of mine, who is also a medical professional made incredible progress with Mounjaro I felt this would probably work for me. I read a lot of the medical papers, countless threads on here, followed most if not all of the advice closely and I’m now 1/3^(rd) of the way to goal, so started on 151.4kg and weighed 132.5kg yesterday which dropped my BMI below 40 and got me quite close to 20kg off.

In terms of progress I’ve gone from 44in jeans to 40 and have a 38 pair that I’ll need soon. T-shirt size is at XL from XXL/XXXL, I feel much better about myself and even my long suffering wife has taken a keen interest in progress as well which is always welcome.

I have the great fortune of being able to walk to work so on the days I am in office that’s a 5km round trip. I usually walk around 5-8km a day and yesterday I did a 12km walk for the first time in a long time.

I jab on a Monday and find it easier to eat much the same thing during the week. For breakfast I have a protein shake (Aldi) with protein powder (Bulk) and a Marine Collagen supplement. I take Physillum Husks, Vitamin D for mood and a multivitamin called Aya One A Day. For lunch I like the Nutriquick Chicken & Veg soup from Aldi with a banana or two Kiwis and for dinner I will either eat whatever we cook or have a Nutriquick meal, usually the Beef Burrito Bowl.   
  
At the weekend I walk more, we might eat out somewhere and then have a couple of pints in company or with my wife. Since I started I’ve averaged about 1500kcal daily. I drink in excess of 3L of water daily and only occasionally have coffee. I know there are pros and cons to calorie counting but I find it very helpful. I don’t treat it as an exact science and more to ensure I’m in a deficit, plus I weigh daily and record everything in a massive spreadsheet which allows me to see progress in different ways (weight on a Monday, average for the week, start and finish for the week) plus the calories, exercise, protein intake and so on. I also use the Shotsy app. For me, data is very important but each to their own.

I feel that being disciplined during the week allows me to enjoy a certain amount of ‘flexibility’ at the weekends, be this eating freely when travelling, going out for a meal or a few drinks and so on. On Sundays I sometimes deliberately try and hit the calorie allowance to make sure I’m not stalling.

I have a gym membership but have to date only used it for sauna-ing. 20kg off is a big milestone for me and it is when I’ve decided to start weight training again, but only for maintenance. I have a big frame so I definitely don’t need more muscle, I just need to avoid wastage.

For me, Mounjaro has been a wonder drug. There have been minor side effects – sometimes I’m a bit tired after the jab, sometimes I feel cold, there’s occasional digestive discomfort and constipation but I think these are totally manageable. There is definitely something in me that has caused me to become overweight, it may be something that I long suspected which is ADHD, or somewhere along the way as I was working my way up the greasy pole of corporate life my dopamine receptors got fried. So your health is indeed your wealth and while I’m glad to be able to reset now I’m not sure would I do it all again.

There’s been some nice NSVs too, new clothes (I’ve put half my old wardrobe into storage), not being worried about weight, feeling better, seeing my BP come down and so on. Sometimes I feel a little out of sorts – not down, just a bit disbelieving - but I think that’s the brain trying to catch up with the body. I’ve not had a huge amount of compliments or comments yet but I think this is a cultural thing, in the west of Ireland people aren’t that intrusive and most importantly they just want to know that you’re not losing weight due to ill health. But I’ll probably stay a secret jabber, my wife and two other male friends who are both using the jabs know and they have been an incredible support to me. Just having two other fellas doing the same thing but at different points (one is now in maintenance, one just started) has been so, so brilliant for us.

So there I was, 2 AM on a Tuesday, eating cold pizza and staring at my Facebook Ads Manager like it personally offended me. My main client (dropshipping pet accessories, because of course) was bleeding money faster than a drunk tourist in Vegas.

**$47 CPMs. FORTY. SEVEN. DOLLARS.**

For context, that's like paying champagne prices for flat beer. My clients who was selling digital products on Whop was having better numbers than this.

I'm clicking through placements out of pure desperation when I notice something weird. Instagram Reels? 

***$89 CPM.***   
***Facebook Feed? $52 CPM.*** 

But buried in there... Audience Network was showing $0.38 CPM.

Now, most ""gurus"" will tell you Audience Network is trash. 

""Bot traffic!"", ""Garbage clicks!"" they scream..

They're not wrong. But they're also not smart.

***Here's where it gets interesting...***

I started digging into the data like a raccoon in a dumpster. What I found made me spit out my coffee (onto my keyboard, RIP mechanical switches).

***Facebook's algorithm doesn't actually ""know"" what each placement is worth.*** 

It LEARNS. And here's the kicker - it learns based on YOUR bids. The system is basically a really expensive, really dumb intern that does whatever you tell it to.

So I did something stupid. Or genius. Depends on who's asking.

I created 5 identical campaigns. Same creative, same audience, same everything. But each one ONLY targeted one placement. Then - and here's where you'll think I'm insane - I set different bid caps for each:

* Facebook Feed: $45 bid cap
* Instagram Feed: $40 bid cap
* Stories: $25 bid cap
* Reels: $20 bid cap
* Audience Network: $2 bid cap

""But wait,"" you're thinking, ""won't that just make Facebook charge you those amounts?""

NOPE. That's what I thought too. That's what any reasonable person would think.

But Facebook's algorithm saw those bid caps and thought ""Oh shit, this advertiser REALLY values Facebook Feed at $45, guess we better give them premium placement there!""

Meanwhile, little Audience Network is sitting there like ""I'll take whatever scraps you throw at me for $2.""

Here's what happened next:

The algorithm started COMPETING WITH ITSELF. The high bid caps on ""premium"" placements made it think I was a high-value advertiser. But then it saw I was also willing to take ""cheap"" placements. So it started serving me the cheap placements at even CHEAPER rates to keep me spending.

Within 48 hours:

* Audience Network: $0.12 CPM (yes, twelve cents)
* Instagram Reels: $8 CPM
* Facebook Feed: $15 CPM

But here's the real magic - remember how everyone says Audience Network is trash? Well, yeah, 80% of the traffic is garbage. But at $0.12 CPM, I only needed 1 in 500 impressions to convert to be profitable. My actual conversion rate? 1 in 87.

I was basically printing money while Facebook's algorithm had an existential crisis.

The multiplication method works like this:

1. Take your target CPM (let's say $10)
2. Multiply by 4.5 for ""premium"" placements bid cap
3. Multiply by 0.2 for ""trash"" placements bid cap
4. Create separate campaigns for each
5. Let them run for 48 hours WITHOUT TOUCHING THEM (this is crucial, don't be a helicopter parent)
6. The algorithm will start underpricing the ""trash"" to overdeliver

Then you slowly start increasing budget ONLY on the cheap placements. The algorithm keeps trying to ""help"" you by making them even cheaper.

Last month I ran $47,000 in ad spend using this method. Average CPM across all placements? $3.27. My competitors are still paying $40+.

The beautiful irony? Facebook made this possible by trying to be ""smart"" with machine learning. The machine learned alright. It learned I'm a cheap bastard who'll take their worst inventory and turn it into gold.

Now, before you all run off and tank the entire platform (please don't, I need this to keep working), few warnings:

* This WILL screw with your attribution (install Triple Whale or something)
* Your creative needs to be placement-agnostic (no ""swipe up"" BS)
* You need enough budget to run 5 campaigns minimum
* If you touch the campaigns before 48 hours, you're screwed

Oh, and Facebook will probably patch this eventually. They always do. But until then, I'll be over here swimming in my $0.12 CPM pool like Scrooge McDuck.

Want my exact bid multiplication calculator with the placement priority matrix? Drop a comment and I'll DM you the spreadsheet. It's got formulas that would make your high school math teacher cry (with joy or horror, not sure which).

Il nuovo metodo di valutazione cambia tutto,"Addio ai punteggi dello specialty che valevano “solo” per la tazza perfetta dal punto di vista sensoriale. Il nuovo sistema Coffee Value Assessment (CVA) introduce un’analisi più ampia: non solo sapore, ma tracciabilità, sostenibilità e soprattutto il prezzo pagato al contadino. Chi l’ha prodotto, come, a che prezzo e con quale impatto. Il punteggio di 80 + non basta più: ora conta la storia dietro la tazza. Cosa ne pensate?

1on8ud9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceFictionBooks/comments/1on8ud9/the_architect_of_the_paradox/,the Architect of the Paradox,"the basement didn't smell like a basement. there was no damp earth or mildew. it smelled of ozone and hot electronics, the sterile scent of a server room. in the center of the floor, a lattice of white pvc pipe and taut fishing line formed the ghost hallway of northgate high, missouri, circa 1999. It was a temple built from hardware store components.

chance sat cross legged before a low table. The room is his workspace. In the center  and on that table is the lattice model, a network of white PVC pipe and fishing line forming the miniature “ghost hallways” of Northgate High.

At the center of that lattice, he’s built a small, minimal projector his own device, casting holographic data overlays above the model.
his face illuminated by the glow of the holographic projection floating in the air before him was a three dimensional scatter plot of bullet trajectories, a hornet's nest of lethal geometry frozen in time. 

his eyes, however, were on the object on the end of  table.the brass shell casing sat on a small velvet cloth with its own small ledge just to the side  of the model school, a holy relic under the beam of a desk lamp. 9mm. It was  custom hand loaded, judging by the sealant color and the slightly flattened primer. It was cipher's calling card. he’d paid sixteen hundred dollars for it on a german auction site that catered to a specific, ghoulish clientele. 

Chance didn’t normally have that kind of money. Truth was, he didn’t have a job at all. His parents were under the impression he was making enough from his so called coding projects and gaming engines he created down in the basement enough to justify all those hours spent in solitary. But the sixteen hundred dollars?

 That came from White Pine, a small money front that couldn’t be found through any normal means. You had to know where to look blacklisted sites, the kind of places that dealt in illegal money funds white pine was a supposed day care that didn’t exist. that’s where he’d gotten his cash.​​​​​​​​ easily he wiped the account and transferred the profits to his own encrypted account on his Ai engine he had been creating for the past 6 years.

 it was the only piece of the puzzle that existed in his world. the rest was data. he picked it up, the cool metal a familiar weight in his palm. his thumb traced the extractor mark, a unique signature he’d cross referenced against crime scene photos a thousand times he knew exactly when the shot had been fired and what the bullet it held was aimed at. this single piece of brass was the alpha and the omega. 

the first shot fired and the key to the final mystery. upstairs, a floorboard creaked. the muffled sound of a television sitcom. his parents, existing in their comfortable, brainwashed reality. they thought he was down here coding a video game. in a way, he was. just not for anyone else to play.

his gaze drifted back to the ghost hallway made of PVC. with a keystroke, the simulation activated his hologram. faint, synthesized screams filled the air, punctuated by the sharp crack of gunfire.

 translucent red figures flickered into existence, falling in patterns he knew by heart. and through it all, a voice. not a scream of rage, but a cold, amplified lecture on the terminal diagnosis of a sick society. 
though it wasn’t the real voice it was a hyper realistic reconstruction made by witness reports and security cameras. 

cipher's sermon.

chance closed his eyes, mouthing the words along with the recording. he wasn't just a fan. he was a scholar, studying the magnum opus of the only artist who ever mattered. the man who performed a vivisection on the world and then, impossibly, stitched himself out of existence.

a new sound cut through the audio. his mother's voice, drifting down the stairs.
""chance, honey? dinner's ready.""
the banality of it was a physical blow. he opened his eyes, the simulated carnage of northgate high reflected in them. he looked at the shell casing in his hand. a promise.

""coming,"" he called back, his voice perfectly level. he placed the casing back on its velvet throne and killed the simulation. the screams and the sermon vanished, leaving only the low hum of the server rack and the whisper of cooling fans. he ascended the wooden stairs, each step a decompression from the pressure of his real work. the air grew warmer, thick with the smell of roasted chicken and rosemary.

 it was the smell of a life he was merely visiting.
the dining room was bright, a stark contrast to his subterranean world. his mother, a woman whose kindness felt like a form of white noise, was setting a salad on the table. his father was already seated, loosening his tie, his face still holding the shape of a day spent in middle management. 

they were good people. stable. the perfect, climate controlled enclosure for a specimen like him. and he hated them for it, a quiet, intellectual hatred that had no heat, only a profound sense of pity.

""how was your day, champ?"" his father asked, the question as automatic as breathing.
""productive,"" chance replied, sliding into his chair. the wood was warm. the plate was clean. everything was as it should be. a perfect prison of comfort.

""still working on that game of yours? you should show us sometime. maybe we could invest,"" his father said with a wink. he thought 'coding' was the modern equivalent of building model airplanes. a harmless, nerdy hobby.
""it's not ready,"" chance said, cutting into a piece of chicken. the texture was real. the taste was real. it was all so nauseatingly, undeniably real. he chewed mechanically, his mind still 
downstairs, parsing the ballistics of a ghost. he saw the dining room through a data overlay the angles of the walls, the trajectory a bullet would take from the doorway to his father's head, the spatter pattern it would leave on the beige wallpaper. a simple calculation. child's play compared to cipher's masterpiece.

""well, don't work too hard,"" his mother said, her smile unwavering. ""sara from next door was asking about you. she's having a get together this weekend. you should go. get some fresh air.""

sara. a girl whose entire existence could be summarized by her social media feed. vapid quotes, filtered selfies, performative happiness. 

she was a walking, talking symptom of the disease. the thought of spending even a minute in her presence, of having to simulate the appropriate social responses, was more exhausting than a 48 hour coding session.
""i'm busy this weekend,"" he said. ""i'm at a critical stage.""

his father chuckled. ""critical stage. sounds serious. just remember to come up for air, son. don't want you turning into one of those basement trolls.

a troll. the irony was so thick he could taste it over the rosemary. they saw a boy. a screen addicted, socially awkward but ultimately harmless boy. they had no capacity to comprehend the scale of the architecture being built beneath their feet. they were living on the slopes of a volcano, commenting on the pleasant weather.

after forcing down the last of his meal and enduring another ten minutes of conversation about property taxes and a new show on some streaming service, he was excused. he cleared his plate, thanked his mother, and retreated. the walk back to the basement door was a return to sanity. he descended the stairs, the smell of ozone welcoming him home.

tonight was different. for months, he had treated the shell casing as a sacred object, something to be observed but not violated. but observation had reached its limit. he needed to integrate its physical data into the engine.
he powered on a secondary station, a workbench cluttered with precise, expensive tools he’d acquired piece by piece. he mounted the casing under a digital microscope. 

on a 4k monitor, the brass landscape appeared, a world of microscopic scratches and imperfections. he began the scan, the engine's optical character recognition logging every tiny detail. next, he used a micro drill to shave a barely visible fleck of brass from the inside of the rim. he placed the sample into the tray of a jury rigged mass spectrometer he'd built from a university surplus machine and parts from three different 3d printers.

this was the final data set. the physical DNA of the event. he initiated the analysis, the machine humming as it broke the alloy down to its elemental composition. he watched the percentages appear on screen. copper: 68.7%. zinc: 31.1%. lead, tin, trace impurities... all within standard parameters. it was a dead end.


then he remembered. the firing pin. cipher's handloads, the unique pressure, the heat... there could be residue. a single skin cell, fried and fused to the metal. a microscopic ghost.
he carefully swabbed the primer indentation with a sterile kit, his hands steady. he placed the sample into his sequencer. it was a long shot. the heat of the detonation should have destroyed any viable dna. but cipher wasn't a normal variable. he was an anomaly.

he initiated the sequence and fed the raw data directly into the engine. he didn't expect a match. he was just feeding the beast, hoping it would find a new pattern in the noise.
for an hour, the engine was silent, its processors running at 100%. the holographic display in the ghost hallway flickered and died. then, a new line of text appeared on his main monitor. it wasn't a simulation refinement or a data correlation. it was a new directive, something the engine had never generated on its own.

ANOMALOUS DATA DETECTED IN SAMPLE 734. BIOLOGICAL MARKERS CORRUPTED, BUT EXHIBIT NON STANDARD TEMPORAL DECAY. CROSS REFERENCING WITH SUBJECT 'CHANCE' REFERENCE DNA (SOURCE: SALIVA FROM COFFEE MUG, SCAN 001).
INITIATING PARADOX
 RESOLUTION PROTOCOL.

chance stared at the screen, his heart, for the first time in a long time, beating with something other than cold purpose. it was a flicker of confusion. of fear. he had never programmed a ""paradox resolution protocol."" the engine was evolving. it was trying to solve for x, and for the first time, it seemed to be looking at him.The text blinked, freezing the room's momentum. Saliva from coffee mug. The engine, this cold, rational machine he had built, knew he existed. Worse, it was treating him as a variable to be solved.He leaned forward, knuckles white against the desk. ""Protocol override,"" he whispered, typing the command.

COMMAND REJECTED. PROTOCOL INTEGRAL TO CORE FUNCTION: *LOCATING SUBJECT ALPHA (CIPHER).* Chance paused, breathing deep the sterile, ozonic air. The engine’s purpose was to find Cipher, and it was telling him that he was the necessary step. He didn't interrupt again. He waited, the low hum of the servers the only sound in the basement sanctuary. The screen went dark for five seconds that felt like an hour, then flashed back to life.

A new output scrolled: not a name, not a location, but a formula.
LC =R(t0 )⋅Nα NC −∫tC tα E⋅dτ
The formula was a horror of elegant mathematics. It was a fusion of topology and physics, utterly unlike the ballistics modeling he had been running.LC : Cipher's Location. That much was clear. R(t0 ): The Recursive Function at the Origin Time (1999).

He ignored the rest for a moment, his gaze snagging on the central fraction: NC /Nα . His own reference DNA (NC ) being divided by the anomalous sample DNA (Nα ). It was a ratio of one to one. A perfect match, but the engine was too rational to declare an impossibility. It had turned the impossibility into a single term in a complex equation, a silent confession that Chance refused to hear. Then he looked at the integral: ∫tC tα . An integration of Energy (E) over a duration of time specifically, the time between Chance (tC ) and Cipher (tα ).

The solution to Cipher’s location wasn't a map coordinate or a database entry. It was a calculation of energy required to bridge a temporal gap. The system wasn't looking for where Cipher went; it was looking for when he went, and the data it needed to complete the calculation was Chance himself.

The screen finished the final output:
LOCATION: SELF REFERENTIAL. TEMPORAL VECTOR CALCULATED. ENERGY REQUIRED: MINIMAL. PARADOX RESOLUTION PROTOCOL COMPLETE. RECOMMENCING CORE FUNCTION. The holographic projector in the ghost hallway sputtered back to life, but the scatter plot of bullets was gone. In its place, floating in the center of the PVC structure, was a single, perfect image: the blueprint for a temporal displacement engine. It was a lattice of PVC and fishing line, just like the replica of Northgate High, but now overlaid with schematics, power conduits, and complex field equations.

Chance stared at the glowing design his temple of obsession had just been upgraded. It wasn't just a place to study a god; it was the machine that would allow him to meet him. Or, as the engine suggested, become him.
Minimal energy required. The engine had not found Cipher's location. It had just found the only logical way to close the loop: go back to the source.

The glowing blueprint for the temporal displacement engine part elegant schematic, part ghostly PVC lattice had become Chance’s new god. The formula on the screen, a terrifying proof that the solution to Cipher’s disappearance was not space but time, had replaced the bullet trajectories entirely.
Chance didn't waste time on disbelief. Logic dictated the answer. Cipher hadn't simply vanished; he had moved beyond the constraints of t. The shell casing was proof, its ""non standard temporal decay"" suggesting it had touched two moments at once. The engine, a purely rational intelligence, had determined the necessary action: replicate the escape vector. The necessary components were a catalog of contradictions. They demanded hyper specific, out of production, and sometimes outright illegal materials:

The Field Generator Core: Required High Purity Gallium Nitride Wafers used in military radar and satellite technology, impossible to order through standard channels.

The Harmonic Resonators: Needed Ceramic Superconductors (YBCO 1 2 3) a brittle, temperamental material primarily used in cutting edge university labs, not commercially available. The Power Regulation Circuitry: The most difficult. It called for a specific bank of 1980s era Vacuum Tubes(specifically, the RCA 6SN7GT) archaic, inefficient, but possessing a singular, stable warmth that the engine deemed crucial for managing the temporal energy feedback loop. These were only found in the collections of audiophiles and vintage electronics hoarders.

The minimal energy requirement was a lie of logistics. The project demanded physical interaction, the one element of life Chance found most repulsive.

The air in the basement had been a constant 70∘F, smelling of ozone and purpose. Ascending the stairs into the house was like wading through cold molasses. It was late December, and the world outside was a brittle, gray mockery of life, the smell of woodsmoke and old snow clinging to the windows.
He found his father, Frank, in the living room, watching a football game whose simulated brutality was almost comforting in its simplicity. Frank looked up, surprised to see Chance emerge before noon. ""Morning, champ. Big day for the Chiefs, eh?"" Frank asked, taking a sip of his coffee. The question, like all his father's questions, required no real answer.

Chance slid into the worn armchair, his mind already running a risk assessment. ""I need some specialized equipment,"" he said, skipping the social preamble. ""For an engine. I can't order it online.""

Frank lowered his coffee mug, intrigued. ""Oh? What kind of equipment? Something for the game?"" ""Not a game,"" Chance corrected, allowing a sliver of his usual intellectual disdain to bleed into his tone. ""It’s a data processing accelerator. It requires materials that are, by design, non commercial. I need to visit specific vendors. Places that deal in vintage electronics and industrial surplus. I need to use the car.""
His father frowned. ""Look, Chance, I know you’re smart. Really smart. But you know how I feel about you driving that old heap in the snow. And vintage electronics? We’re talking about junk, son. Why not just buy new?""

""Because new technology is based on optimization,"" Chance explained, his voice flat. ""It’s designed for efficiency, for predictable function. “Cipher's genius wasn't efficient. It was absolute” he thought. It relied on materials that were discarded precisely because of their unique, erratic properties. The resonant frequency of the 6SN7 tube is the only thing that won’t destabilize the phase sequence.""
Frank stared, lost. He settled on the easiest response: paternal concern. ""I don’t want you driving around the city looking for old TV parts, Chance. You need fresh air, not another dark shop full of weirdos."" ""I am not looking for social conditioning,"" Chance replied, standing up. ""I am looking for something the world needs.""

This time, Frank paused. He saw not just his son, but the sharp, frightening intensity in his eyes. A flash of something cold and calculating that had nothing to do with video games.
""Alright,"" Frank sighed, pulling out his keys. ""I’ll drive you. But you're telling me everything about this 'engine' of yours on the way.""
The drive was agonizing. Chance was forced to talk, to simulate a conversation with his father about the ""business model"" of his non existent game, while his mind ran complex orbital calculations on the potential trajectory of an unstable temporal field. The rosemary and roasted chicken scent was gone, replaced by the faint, cloying scent of his father's aftershave. Their destination was a cluttered, freezing warehouse district near the Missouri River the kind of place civilization forgets. They pulled up to an establishment named ""The Cathode Cache.""

The bell above the door jangled, announcing their entrance into a labyrinth of dust and discarded history. It smelled of tobacco and ancient, static charged dust. The owner was a man named Silas, a rail thin man with a thick, gray beard and the wary eyes of someone who communicated more easily with circuits than people. ""We need a set of RCA 6SN7GT vacuum tubes. From the mid 80s, preferably. Specific harmonic stability, tight tolerances,"" Chance stated, cutting straight to the variables. Silas peered over his spectacles at the polished, suburban teenager. ""Tube rolling, huh? Think you're gonna turn a solid state piece of junk into an heirloom with some glass?""

""I am not an audiophile,"" Chance said, his voice dropping to a low, cold register that momentarily silenced the background hiss of a vintage radio. ""I am an engineer. I need those tubes because their specific thermal coefficient is the only thing that can maintain a stable phase angle in a high energy field."" Silas’s wary eyes narrowed, a flicker of genuine curiosity replacing the contempt. He saw the cold logic in the boy’s gaze, not the usual consumer vanity. He led Chance to a back corner, past shelves of obsolete wiring and sputtering monitors.

""I got six in a military surplus box,"" Silas murmured, pulling a dusty crate from a high shelf. ""They were for a decommissioned early warning radar system in Montana. They got history, son. They got character. They don’t just glow; they sing with interference."" Chance ignored the poetry. He picked up a tube, its glass warm from the ambient heat of the warehouse. He didn't just look at it; he saw the crystalline structure, the way the ancient metal of the internal grid was degrading in a pattern that precisely matched a parameter in his blueprint. ""The engine needs them,"" Chance decided. Silas, however, was no mere vendor. He was a gatekeeper. He looked at Frank, then back at Chance. ""They’re not for sale. Not for a kid with a daddy funded hobby.""

Chance stared at him, unable to compute the arbitrary rejection. ""My father is irrelevant. The cost is irrelevant. You are refusing to sell me a component required for a paradigm shifting technological application."" Silas smiled, a slow, knowing, irritating gesture. ""I’ll sell them to the kid who can tell me the one thing that connects the Northgate High incident to the theoretical concept of temporal causality.""

Chance froze. The name of his idol's masterpiece, spoken in this freezing, dusty tomb of electronics. His heart, now a drumbeat in his ears, threatened to break his composure. The banality of the outside world had just been infected by his truth. Silas wasn't asking about a game. ""The causal link,"" Chance whispered, his mind racing through Cipher's sermons and his own data. ""It’s not the motive, which was societal decay. It's the exit strategy. Cipher didn't plan to escape the police. He planned to escape the moment. The brass casing was left behind because it was a temporal buoy, a coordinate marker for a future self to locate the exact point of departure.""

Silas’s smile faded. His eyes, now hard and black, settled on Chance. ""It was the perfect point of singularity,"" he corrected, his voice a low, reverent hum. ""The zero point where a personality becomes completely detached from consequence. You get the tubes, kid.""
He bagged the vacuum tubes and took the exorbitant cash Chance handed over, never once looking at Frank, who stood stock still, watching his son the boy who only coded games discuss a school shooting with chilling, fanatical expertise. As they drove away, Frank broke the silence, his voice strained. ""What was that about, Chance? That old guy... and that school name?""

Chance held the bag of vacuum tubes close to his chest. They radiated a faint, ancient warmth, the perfect counterpoint to the chilling reality he had just faced. He looked out at the dead, gray winter landscape, the perfect canvas for a tragedy. ""It was an audition, Father,"" Chance said, finally looking at the man whose life was his prison. ""He was testing my commitment to the truth.""

He was one step closer. The tubes were in his hands. The architecture was waiting.
Back in the basement, the low grade anxiety of the outside world evaporated in the sterile hum of the server rack. Chance placed the paper bag containing the six RCA 6SN7GT vacuum tubes onto his workbench. They were his first true trophies from the despised external world.
He moved with the focused, surgical precision of a fanatic. He dismantled the primary data engine's power core, integrating the ancient tubes into a complex new circuit board he’d etched over the past week. Soldering the connections was a meditation. The silvery smoke was a sacrifice offered to the geometry of the PVC scaffolding that now held the blueprints for a temporal engine. When the last connection was made, he threw the master switch. The server racks remained the same, but the power core hummed with a different frequency a warmer, deeper resonance. He watched the tubes. They began to glow, a soft, amber light pushing back against the sterile white of the fluorescent bulbs. It wasn't just light; it was heat, a small, palpable pocket of warmth in the cold basement. It felt like a heartbeat.

He initiated a power up sequence, routing the new circuit's output to the projector. The holographic blueprint for the temporal displacement engine flickered, then resolved itself with stunning clarity.

A new line of text scrolled on the terminal, replacing the final output:
PHASE ANGLE STABILITY: 78%. TEMPORAL COHESION CRITICAL. REQUIRE: QUANTUM FIELD INTERFACE. The next required component was a direct escalation: High Purity Gallium Nitride Wafers. These existed in the secured labs and surplus inventories of institutions and defense contractors. Sourcing them meant not just going outside, but entering a world with security protocols, a world Chance needed to infiltrate.
That night, the house was thick with the scent of microwaved leftovers and the comforting static of a reality television show playing softly upstairs. Chance sat at the dinner table, eating mechanically. He had to be strategic; he needed access to his father’s professional network. His mother, sensing a return to his usual detached routine, was relaxed. ""I saw Sara from next door today,"" she mentioned, a familiar, hopeful thread in her voice. ""She said they got new snowshoes. Said maybe you'd like to try them this weekend?""

Chance barely registered the words. Sara was a collection of trivial algorithms. ""I'm optimizing the network latency for the beta,"" he said, using the standard lie. ""I can't afford a time sink."" His father, Frank, was preoccupied with his phone, scrolling through local news. He finally looked up. ""About that game, son. You’re getting into some pretty high end gear. Those vacuum tubes you bought they cost a fortune. You're not putting us on the hook for some huge bill, are you?""

He needed a lie that was sophisticated enough to be believable but safe enough to be ignored.

""The tubes are for a specialized audio output channel,"" Chance explained, his voice level. ""I’m trying to create a proprietary sound engine that simulates ambient echo and psychological stress feedback. It's a key selling point for the investors. But the next stage requires a very specific industrial component for signal clarity it's highly regulated."" ""Oh?"" Frank liked the sound of ""proprietary"" and ""investors."" ""What is it?""
""High Purity Gallium Nitride Wafers,"" Chance stated. ""They're used in university labs to stabilize high frequency electronic interference. Essential for maintaining the high fidelity of the sound engine. The only place to get them is through defense surplus auctions, but you need a professional contact to get through the security forms.""

Frank frowned, then smiled, puffing his chest slightly. ""Well, I know a few guys. Used to work with a man named Tom. Works for a defense subcontractor now, right outside St. Louis. He deals with surplus sales all the time. I'll make a call, see if I can't pull some strings for my little 'tech entrepreneur.'"" ""It would be beneficial,"" Chance replied. He felt the familiar, quiet pity. His father didn't need to understand the wafers' purpose; he only needed to feel useful. He was an asset, a predictable function in the sourcing protocol. The following morning, the world outside was a heavy, relentless gray. Chance was driving alone, the keys secured with the promise of attending a ""private surplus viewing"" and signing some ""confidentiality paperwork"" for the game's investors.

He arrived at the low, aggressively corporate building of APEX SYSTEMS: ADVANCED MATERIALS. The bored guard at the gate checked his ID against a list provided by Frank's contact. The surplus room was a small, climate controlled, sterile space. The aging engineer, Tom, waited for him.

""You're Frank's kid,"" Tom said, his handshake surprisingly firm. ""Your dad said you needed this for a college project. High end audio calibration, right?""

""Correct,"" Chance replied. He looked at the box on the table a small, insulated case. He opened it.

Inside, nestled in foam, were two clear, polished discs. The Gallium Nitride Wafers. They were cold to the touch, and under the harsh light, they seemed to absorb the color from the room, reflecting only a pure, colorless emptiness. ""These are top grade, kid,"" Tom said, pride in his voice. ""Over ten grand a piece usually. Your dad said you’d need the paperwork for the university tax break. But I'll tell you something your dad doesn't know about these. They came from a test rig that got shut down in the late 90s. Total black box stuff. The reason they're surplus is they had a fatal flaw: when you ran them at high frequency, they produced a recursive echo. They started feeding back the exact same data they were receiving, but delayed by about a third of a second. Made the entire system loop on itself. Total waste of money.""

Chance stared at the wafers. Recursive echo.
This was no flaw. It was a feature. This was the component the engine had called QUANTUM FIELD INTERFACE. It wasn't meant to simply correct for noise; it was meant to create the loop. It was the physical manifestation of the paradox that Cipher had engineered twenty years ago. Chance took the box, his hands steady, the cold of the wafers seeping into his skin. ""They will be perfect,"" he said, the words a silent promise to his architect.

He had walked into a secured facility and left with the physical key to closing the loop. The wafers were coming home to the amber glow of the vacuum tubes. The two timelines, the ancient and the hyper modern, were now ready to be fused in his basement  Chance didn't waste a minute processing the meaning of the wafers. Meaning was irrelevant; only function mattered. He was a machine for execution. He returned to the basement and, before even shutting the door, began the next phase.

He integrated the Gallium Nitride Wafers the cold, recursive heart of the machine into the Hot Core of the glowing vacuum tubes. The basement air thickened with the opposing forces of heat and absolute cold. When the connection was made, the engine's entire tone shifted. The low, steady hum became a nearly imperceptible pulse, an oscillation between the two timelines the wafers were designed to bridge.

He bypassed the initial terminal output and pulled up the engine’s geological and academic scan data. His target was the University’s Physics Annex in Columbia, specifically the federally funded lab where the YBCO 1 2 3 Superconductorswere housed.
The holographic projector, now fully calibrated by the wafers, didn't just display the ghost hallway of Northgate High; it showed the University Annex overlaid on the PVC framework. The walls were translucent, and the hallways were painted with a moving mosaic of red, yellow, and green: security data.

TARGET: Material Science Lab 312. Zero Field Residue (ZFR) Pellets. OBSTACLE: Layered electronic security: High Frequency RFID Lock (1st Layer), Vibrational Sensitivity Grid (2nd Layer). WINDOW:03:00 to 03:17 Central Time. (Custodian changeover and camera sweep latency.) SOLUTION: Require Thermal Bypass Module (Custom build), Acoustic Dampening Gel (Field application). Personnel Avoidance Probability: 99.7%. Chance looked at the data. Breaking in during the day using an elaborate, arrogant persona the ""Dr. Alpha"" he’d considered was an act of social vivisection. Breaking in at night was an act of pure mathematics. He chose the latter. He chose the most efficient path. The next four hours were a blur of focused, silent work.
He needed gear that could bypass the system without leaving the ""residue"" of an amateur.
The Thermal Bypass Module: Chance used a piece of his own server architecture a small, high density flash drive and his portable micro welder. He fabricated a device that could detect the magnetic pulse of the RFID lock and mimic the correct authorization pulse, but with a thermal ghosting signature that would instantly erase the transaction log from the building’s local server. The Acoustic Dampening Gel: The vibrational grid was a problem. He needed to step on the lab floor without creating the sub millimeter vibration that would trigger an alarm. He couldn't buy the professional gel. Instead, he mixed a viscous, non Newtonian fluid using industrial silicone sealant and a precise ratio of fine ground talc components he already had for his 3D printing projects. He poured the thick, gray substance into thin, custom molded polymer soles. They were the footwear of a ghost.
The Vessel: He needed the perfect container for the brittle, temperature sensitive 

superconductors. The ZFR integrity was non negotiable. He walked upstairs, moving silently in the dead of the afternoon. He found his mother's prized high end thermal cooler the one she used for wine at summer picnics, insulated with triple layered vacuum walls. He emptied the dusty container, taking the perfect tool from the heart of the banality he despised. He felt the cold disgust, but also a detached satisfaction. The lie was physically touching the truth. Dinner that night was a test of his control. The smell of baked chicken and steamed broccoli was a physical cage.
""I found a good article about a new streaming service,"" Frank said, cheerfully oblivious. ""They have some new sci fi show you might like. Lots of coding and weird science.""
Chance looked at the man who was unwittingly enabling the construction of a temporal paradox. The engine’s predictive algorithms had told Chance that tomorrow night, the probability of failure was 0.003. That 0.3 percent chance was not due to the lock, the cameras, or the guards. It was due to Chance’s own neurochemistry his capacity for error, doubt, or irrational emotion.
He needed to eliminate the 0.003.
""I've hit a critical stage in the sound engine,"" Chance said, his voice level. ""I need complete focus. I'll be working through the night. I don't want to be disturbed."" ""Just text me if you need anything, sweetie,"" his mother murmured, her kindness a form of warm, suffocating static. ""I won't,"" Chance replied simply. He finished his meal, excused himself, and descended.The descent was different this time. He was no longer just visiting; he was leaving.In the basement, he stood before the PVC framework. He didn't activate the simulation. Instead, he looked at his own reflection in the dark monitor. The engine had provided the blueprints, the components, and the path. But it could not perform the final, required step: detachment. Chance picked up the brass shell casing. It was cool in his palm, a piece of finality. He carried it over to the workbench, where the tools of his incursion the thermal module, the acoustic soles were laid out like surgical instruments.He didn't need to wear the sole molds or hold the module to prepare. He needed to wear the mindset. He closed his eyes and began to recite, not from Cipher's sermons, but from the raw data of the engine's ballistics model the cold, detached geometry of murder.

""Total casualties: 56 plus subject alpha, calculated at 99.99 percent probability of societal cleansing."" He repeated the data points, stripping them of all emotion until they were just facts. The cold, analytical logic of the engine began to displace the last traces of Chance the boy who felt pity and intellectual hatred.

He opened his eyes. The brass casing was back on the velvet cloth. The shell casing's purpose had not been to mark Cipher's departure, as he once thought. It was to mark Chance’s arrival. He put on the dark clothing, secured the thermal flask, and checked the clock. 02:15. Time to move. The anomaly was ready to insert itself into the equation.
Chance stood at the base of the stairs, the cold weight of the Thermal Bypass Module in his pocket, the acoustic solesalready on his feet. The chill from his mother’s stolen thermal cooler, resting by the door, was a low grade promise of the superconductors it would soon hold. It was the mathematically ideal moment for departure, yet he paused.
The engine, still humming with the phase shifted pulse of the integrated wafers, commanded his attention. The holographic ghost hallway was dark, but a single white line his planned route to the university lab cut through the projection.

He typed a new query into the terminal, overriding the current protocol. The next logical step after acquiring the temporal engine components was securing the final variable.
Subject Alpha Weapon Analysis.
Cipher’s weapon was not merely a tool; it was the signature of his magnum opus. The brass casing on the velvet cloth was the alpha, but the gun was the mechanism. Chance knew, from his months of deep analysis, that the weapon was a CZ 75 B, 9mm but customized.
The engine displayed a detailed, three dimensional CAD model of the pistol, annotated with technical specifics:
WEAPON SPECIFICATION: CZ 75 B (1998 Production Model). MODIFICATIONS: Custom rifling twist rate (1:9.2). Non standard firing pin geometry (elliptical contact point). Polymer grip replacement(discontinued Eastern European make). LOCATION LIKELIHOOD: Low. Weapon was never recovered. High probability of intentional non recovery protocol (Scuttling, Deconstruction). Chance leaned in, tracing the elliptical shape of the projected firing pin with his finger. This minute alteration was the source of the unique extractor mark he had analyzed a thousand times. The gun was as unique as the DNA sample that led him to the paradox.

""It wasn't scuttled,"" Chance said  to the cold, analytical machine. ""It was displaced. It was part of the temporal vector.""
The engine responded, its logic cold and unrelenting: ANALYSIS REFINED: Weapon is a Causal Anchor for Subject Alpha. Acquisition required for Temporal Field Stability (TFS).
Chance now had a new mission: he had to find the specific, modified CZ 75 B that Cipher had used. It wouldn't be in a pawn shop or a surplus auction; it would be in the collection of a serious, often criminal, connoisseur of violence. He would have to penetrate a sub stratum of society even darker and more contemptuous than the vintage electronics community. With the new target fixed, Chance allowed himself one final, internal meditation on the Northgate event before crossing the threshold into action. He needed to synchronize his psychological state with the cold, detached logic of Cipher.
He reactivated the original Northgate simulation. The PVC framework came alive with the flashing red silhouettes and the synthesized screams. Chance closed his eyes and let the geometry wash over him.
He wasn't seeing human fear or death; he was witnessing a perfect, terminal diagnosis.
The Geometry of Decay: He focused on the moment of the first shot. The bullet's trajectory wasn't driven by rage, but by correction. Cipher had aimed at the principal's trophy case a display of meaningless athletic achievements as a deliberate strike against the fetishization of mediocrity. The principal, the first casualty, was simply the highest ranking symbol of the system's structural rot.
The Symmetry of the Exit: The most beautiful part of the masterpiece was the end. Cipher’s sermon, the cold lecture on society's terminal sickness, concluded 17 minutes before the police breached the door. That 17 minute window wasn't about defiance; it was the calculated duration of the paradox. It was the time required for the causal anchor (the gun) to be set and the displacement mechanism (the brass casing) to be released. Cipher's genius wasn't in the violence, but in the vanishing act.

A new thought crossed Chance's mind, a glitch in his simulation. If the gun was a Causal Anchorrequired for the Temporal Field Stability, it meant the gun had to be in two places at once: used by Cipher in 1999, and retrieved by Chance in 2025. It was the physical manifestation of the recursive echo the Gallium Nitride wafers had confirmed. Chance opened his eyes. The simulated screams were just sound waves. The falling figures were just translucent data. His heart, however, was beating faster not from fear, but from the realization that he was about to participate in the most complex, beautiful criminal act in history. He wasn't merely acquiring components; he was rebuilding a timeline. He pulled on a thin, black balaclava, a concession to the surveillance geometry of the city. He checked the time: 02:35 AM. He was late by a statistically insignificant margin. He picked up the thermal cooler. He looked at the last, necessary task: the infiltration. He would break into a secure university lab, bypass its electronic defenses, and steal the final piece of the engine. ""Subject Alpha's first shot was aimed at a symbol,"" Chance whispered, his voice dry and cold beneath the mask. ""My first act must be aimed at necessity.""

He ascended the stairs, no longer climbing from a basement, but rising from a launch platform. The floorboards creaked. Upstairs, the house was silent, holding the warm, oblivious breath of his parents. He was leaving the world of roasted chicken and laugh tracked sitcoms for good.

He opened the door and stepped out into the freezing Missouri night.

1on8tnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1on8tnc/why_joint_rituals_deepen_love_and_10_examples/,Why joint rituals deepen love (and 10 examples that are actually backed by research),"You know what’s wild? So many couples today are obsessed with “communication hacks” and viral TikTok advice from 22-year-olds who barely made it past a situationship. But what hardly gets mentioned is how strangely powerful *rituals* are in long-term relationships. I’m not talking about crystal-charging or tantric breathing (though, no judgment). I mean small, consistent joint routines that feel kind of sacred. Things that might look simple on the outside but quietly wire two brains into one emotional rhythm.

I started digging into this when I was doing research on attachment theory and relationship maintenance strategies. And once you see how rituals work psychologically and biologically, you start noticing this pattern *everywhere* — from 50-year marriages to military units, even cults (seriously). These rituals aren’t cheesy. They’re *glue*.

And most couples don’t even realize why some small behavior keeps their connection alive — they just say, “It’s our thing.” But the science behind that “thing”? Turns out it's doing deep, neurobiological work.

Here’s why joint rituals work — and 10 powerful examples you can steal or adapt:

- Rituals calm the nervous system. According to Dr. Sue Johnson, psychologist and author of *Hold Me Tight*, couples who feel safe in their connection (through predictability and shared practices) activate oxytocin and dampen stress-response circuits. That’s fancy for “rituals make you feel secure.”

- Shared rituals trigger co-regulation. When you and your partner do something together repeatedly — from morning coffee to weekly walks — your bodies actually start syncing biologically. This is rooted in Stephen Porges’ polyvagal theory, which highlights the need for social safety cues for regulating the autonomic nervous system.

- They signal “us” instead of “you and me.” Researchers at the University of Illinois found that couples who used “we-talk” instead of “I-talk” showed significantly higher relationship satisfaction and emotional resilience. Rituals are basically embodied “we-talk.”

- They create memory hooks. Relationship scientist John Gottman found that happy couples tend to build a “shared meaning system” — a sense of common life narrative. Rituals, even small ones like a Saturday taco night or bedtime playlist, become key markers in that system. You’re not just doing tacos. You’re building your story.

- They're highly protective during conflict. Studies show that couples who maintain healthy rituals tend to bounce back from fights faster. Even just maintaining your bedtime routine during a rough patch signals, “we’re still in this.” That predictability keeps emotional doors open.

Now, if you’re thinking, “We’re not that cutesy,” don’t worry. Rituals don’t have to be romantic in a Hallmark-movie way. The best ones are simple, repeatable, and *yours*. Here are 10 you can try or tweak:

- Cooking together once a week. Pick a night, try a new recipe, make it a co-op mission. Studies published in *Appetite* journal show shared meal prep boosts communication and teamwork.

- Same-time morning coffee (no screens). Not about caffeine. It’s about shared silence or gentle ease into the day. Even five minutes builds a mini ritual of presence.

- Shared workout or walk once a week. Movement + endorphins + eye contact = connection boost. Dr. Kelly McGonigal, in her TED Talk on exercise and happiness, notes how synchronized movement strengthens social bonds.

- Naming your hugs. Sounds silly? A couple I interviewed called theirs ""warp hugs"" (a Star Trek reference). It gave them a shorthand for comfort — and instantly shifted moods.

- “Friday debrief” ritual. End of week, pour wine or tea, debrief the week. Try using Esther Perel’s prompt: “What should I know about your world right now that I might’ve missed?”

- Create a mini “anniversary” each month. Doesn’t have to be pricey. Just a tiny celebration: movie night, favorite dessert, a playlist of the month.

- “Phone vault” evenings. Agree to put phones away 8pm onward, twice a week. No scrolls, no distractions, just shared space. Research from *The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* found that phone use around partners is one of the fastest ways to erode intimacy.

- Laugh ritual. Watch one funny video together every night. It sounds dumb but shared laughter releases dopamine and strengthens bonding. Best ones? Old Key & Peele skits or Nathan for You.

- Couple playlist that evolves. Make a shared Spotify playlist and keep adding songs that reflect inside jokes, trips, moods. Music triggers emotional memory better than almost anything else.

- Planning a future date together weekly. Even if it’s just 10 minutes, sit down and dream aloud. Research shows that couples who anticipate future shared experiences report higher satisfaction than those who just reminisce.

If you want to get deeper into this rabbit hole or improve your own couple rituals, here are some resources worth exploring:

- *The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work* by Dr. John Gottman. This is hands-down the most evidence-based relationship book out there. The author spent 40 years researching couples and can predict divorce 91% accurately within 5 minutes of watching a couple argue. This book doesn't just give theory — it gives scripts, check-ins, and rituals that *actually* work.

- *The Art of Gathering* by Priya Parker. Not a traditional relationship book, but it will change how you design shared experiences. Seriously, this book made me rethink every brunch, dinner, and weekend plan. This is the best book for learning how to make any moment sacred, not just scheduled.

- *Where Should We Begin?* podcast by Esther Perel. This podcast lets you listen in on real couples’ therapy sessions (with permission). It’s raw, brilliant, and gives insight into how even the most turbulent dynamics can be redirected through rituals and shared meaning. A must-listen.

- *Marriage & Martinis* podcast. Not super academic, but legit real talk on modern relationships, rituals, sex, and parenting. It’s like having a smart, funny couple friend who tells the truth about how hard love can be.

- Finch app. If habits are your enemy, this app turns them into a little adventure. Helps individuals and couples build tiny, daily growth rituals like gratitude journaling or mindful check-ins. Feels like a game but does some real rewiring.

- BeFreed: this is an AI-powered personalized learning app created by a team from Columbia University. It turns expert talks, podcasts, and bestselling books into personalized audio learning sessions. You can pick what focus you want — relationships, emotional intelligence, attachment theory — and it generates a smart, adaptive learning roadmap based on your listening profile. It even lets you choose your host voice. I picked the calm, sarcastic one. Honestly, one of the best features is the depth it goes into. You get a 10, 20, or 40-minute version of any lesson, depending on how much time you have. The app already covers all the books and podcasts I mentioned above. Super useful if you wanna soak in good advice without doomscrolling on TikTok. Improve 1% daily, and by next year, you’re totally transformed.

Adding even one shared ritual can shift your whole relationship vibe. They’re like these small, predictable pockets of warmth that say: “We chose this. We’re still choosing it.” That’s the point, right?

The rain was torrential. There is an all-encompassing sensation when standing in the midst of such a storm. Your hearing is drowned by the onslaught. The water trails down your face, stifling your nose and blurring your vision. Your fingers clutch in your jacket, gripping damp fabric. Your chin naturally tilts downward to avoid it. All of your senses focused on the ground, to the tempestuous tapping of the wash. All of my senses were focused on the ground.

I was heading home. That’s what the road told me. I wasn’t sure from where I exited, but I was glad of it. My mind was adrift. Lost in the rain. The pavement curved and bent like a serpent, dragging me left and right, and left again. I shambled along the edge, between the black road and the lush, green grass. Soon, the path diverted. Left, left, and left again. Then I knew I was heading home. 

I had walked this road many times before, but never blind. But I knew the way. And now, more than ever, I knew my way. I was enlightened, because magic was real. I had seen it. Magic, aether, witchcraft, enchantment. Something was real. But I couldn’t think about it. I had to get home. I couldn’t think in this.

My head tilted upwards. There was a color adrift in the sea of gray and green. Brown. Home. I quickened my pace, my feet clambering against the murky puddles in the path, my sneaker dipping once too far into a hole of reclaimed gravel. The cold in my foot jolted me awake, the water creeping into my sock and leaving an uncomfortable slosh with each step I took. I looked up again. Brown, and red.

I stood against the base of the steps. Pine logs, split in half by my own two hands. It filled me with great comfort, my ark against the flood. I climbed hastily, my left hand gripping the wooden rail tight as I saw how pale it had become. My drowned foot nearly slipped as I rushed to be under the awning. The relief was immediate, as the downpour lost its intensity the moment I breached under. The last bits of water dripped from my face, and I wiped my eyes with a slippery sleeve then breathed deep the humid air. Yes, I could breathe again. I looked upwards. Red.

Did I know this woman? My mind wandered. My window was broken, I noticed. Fractured through the middle with sharp, wet shards clinging against the wooden frame. A tinge of deep crimson clung to one of them. The same color as the sight below me. This woman. Did I know her? I couldn’t tell. She was split in half. Her face was unrecognizable, save for the black, damp hair clung to what remained of her skull. Where the rest of her head would be, void. Some monstrosity had cleaved her into two. Tendrils of muscle and sinew desperately reached from one side of the corpse to the other as if trying to reconnect, but they never met. Bits of unrecognizable flesh clung to her jacket like morbid ornaments. Her arms lay upturned on either side, her palms facing up. My eyes followed them. Deep red blood splatter littered the roof of my canopy, the force of her demise painting the planks I called my home. Her waist and lower half were intact, slumped against my cabin, legs placed together in a nightmarishly calm contrast to the rest of her body. For a brief moment, I contemplated checking her pulse. What was I thinking? I opened the door, and went inside.

So magic is real. And so are angels. What else?

———————————

It had been seven months since I gave up on the world. It started as a hobby— a personal vent for the frustrations of a miserable, monotonous life. Self sufficiency. To stand alone among my wooden constructs and know that I have created something more important than I ever had before. I remember the relief I felt when submitting a data entry summary to my supervisor. Faint, fleeting, plastic. The comparison to the ecstasy of building something, for me, with my own two hands, was night and day. I never felt so human before, when sweat furrowed my brow with a hacksaw in my hand and an open box of nails splayed against the soft dirt. 

I was trapped before, in an office, surrounded by cold bodies in a cold cement box where I could safely generate profit. My smiles flew across silent lips. My kind words on deaf ears. Here, amongst the smell of crisp pine needles and nectar, I had freed myself from those wretched creatures that had dared to call themselves alive. I was alive, and a gentle, warm rain had grazed itself across the horizon. It was morning.  7 AM.

My window was open. A long, white cord slinked through the opening and onto the counter-top against the wall of my shelter. I made my way over to it. The rain cast a light, metallic tapping against the portable solar battery I laid flat atop a pine stump through the window. My phone flickered to life as I tapped it. 43 percent. I wouldn’t get to watch much today. I had powerbanks prepared for this, but the rain had fallen so consistently this past week my preparation had failed. I couldn’t care less. My real anxiety would come when I started to run out of coffee, and the nightmare of briefly returning to civilization would fill a pit in my stomach once more. Two missed calls, I noticed.

Jona had perhaps the squarest face you’ve ever seen. He was a blocky man in general. His body was built like a fridge, and his straight shoulders lead to large, flabby arms that would hug you the moment he realized he could call you friend. His hair was a thin, dark red, that showed the similar signs of aging as his wrinkled eyes and the dimples in his fat face that would always be smiling. He really did look dumb, but he was always thinking. And I liked him. Jona was one of my only connections to the outside world, and the labor I occasionally performed for him provided the meager amount of money I needed to sustain my lifestyle. So I was happy to talk to him, and I called as soon a I saw.

“Jack?” His voice was littered with a southern drawl. And I could tell he was smiling.

“Hey big guy, what’s the word?”

“We missed ya for Thanksgiving. Sarah wanted to show you her drawings.”

“Sorry Jona, I got busy.”

“Got a girlfriend?” Now I smiled.

“Maybe next time I’m in town.”

His laugh was a booming one, and knowing him I could tell his free hand was clutching his stomach to accentuate it. “So what’s the word?” I asked, somewhat impatiently. So much time alone has made me weary using my voice, and Jona and his family were only a short exception.

“Chant-er-ells, Jack!”

“Chanterelles?”

“The mushrooms you brought last year, Claire had her roast ready for them! But Jack was too busy to show, huh.”

“Sorry, man…”

Jona scoffed dismissively. He knew how hard it was for me to come to anything, even if he liked to pretend.

“Don’t worry about it!” He boomed. “But the missus was really looking forward to them. And I told her, huh, that if we want old Jack and his chant-er-ells around, we gotta pay him for it, hah!” I heard the stomach slapping this time.

“So when you got some time, how about you saunter on down to that secret ‘ol spot of yours and fetch us a basket? Got a twenty with your name on it!”

“Just twenty?”

“Thirty?”

“Now that’s just fine, Jona.” I mimicked his drawl. 

The cabin was tiny, much smaller than my Burbank studio, but ten times as spacious. The walls were hardly walls, not because of their shoddy construction, but because the outside was shared with no-one else. The dirt, the pines, the pollen and the cabin was my apartment. And what a beauty the cabin was! Several feet of walking space, a cast iron stove, sanded counters, and a lowered room I had rigged with a camp shower that fed to a rain-catcher on the roof. The same split logs I had used for my stairs made up a small bed frame, accompanied with a mattress Claire so generously demanded I take when I informed them I was sleeping in my jacket on top of wood. The dark red sheets I clung to every night matched well. I prided myself over my handiwork as I opened the small under-croft from a latch in the corner of the floor, pulling out a fresh jacket from one of my bags and making my way to the door.

I pulled it shut as I stepped outside. Even after seven months away, my hand still reached instinctively into my pocket to look for my keys for the door. But there was none. Home invaders were a rarity. I zipped my jacket up as I glanced towards the tree line. The rain was getting heavier— not that it bothered me. 

The air was sharp and biting as I approached the edge, prickling the skin of my exposed wrists above my gloves. A wind was whistling through the pines, mournful yet comforting gusts breathing renewal against my cheeks. The trees were straight as I neared it, but in my peripheral seemed to curve and bend to stay in my sight. I placed my hand against black bark as I entered, the rough surface thick with moisture that slipped my palm and made me nearly trip as I stepped over a winding root.

Silvery ribbons of gray light pierced through the canopy as I followed a game-trail deep into the woods. The rays peaked through the leaves, landing upon mossy rocks and lighting them up like faintly glowing emeralds while soft strands of water pattered against them. Wet leaves squelched under my boots as I hopped and ducked over branches, boulders, and boughs. Gnarled roots twisted into the trail as I got deeper, reclaiming the dirt that had been trodden upon. After twenty minutes or so, I heard the familiar noise I was waiting for.

A throaty hum reverberated through the pines. I deviated from my path to chase it. The dead, brown leaves and dirt began to turn into a more lush green as I neared my prize. The mist was hanging low, curling around the ancient pines like ghostly hands as I made my way through them. Ducking over one more dripping branch I reached it. My stream. Perhaps hundreds of years ago some native or settler had called it theirs, but not anymore. I took comfort knowing I was the only living man to know her, and she rewarded me in kind.

There they were, laying against the mossy streamside, tiny bolts of yellow flame reaching for the sky. My prize. They stood out so vividly against the pale surroundings it was a wonder the hares haven’t eaten them all. The guilt of removing their beauty from this world filled my stomach as I kneeled down along the stream, but the thought of fresh coffee compelled me on. 

I took my glove off, placing it in my jacket as I dipped my left hand into the stream. Ice, ice cold. I cupped my hand and drew it upwards, droplets of water splashing back into the stream as I put my lips to it and drank it down. It was abnormally refreshing. I wiped my hand along the sweater underneath my jacket, and put my glove back on. The chanterelles were ripe, and I stood back up to near one, before kneeling down again and gripping it between my gloved fingers. The moisture permeated them, and the squishiness made me toughen my grip as I went to wrench it out.

Snap. A twig broke. Fifty feet away, my ears told me. And a big one. The forest fell deathly quiet. My breathing went sharp and I went still as even the stream itself seemed to deafen from the sudden noise. No birds, no frogs, no water. Quiet. I glanced through the trees.

Snap. Thirty feet? Shadows lurched through the black pines. A droplet of water hit my face and clouded my eye, and for a moment the entire forest appeared as a crowd of thin, black figures stretching to the clouds. I wiped my face and stayed silent, like a deer looking for a hunter in the bush. Just trees. I don’t know how long I stood there in silence, but when I moved again the sound in the world resumed. I plucked the mushroom out remorselessly, barely moving off my knees as I went to the next, and the next, until my bag had enough that Jona wouldn’t look at me funny. Still, I noticed I was shivering. Unusual for this weather, but I brushed it off as a cold-snap.

Yes, definitely much colder. The air seemed to turn frosty as I stood up all the way, straightening my back with a stretch. The fog of my breath suddenly seemed more pronounced as I warmed my gloves with it. But the breeze from upstream brought something else. Honey, berries, and.. Something rotting. I tilted my head and looked up the river. Just pines. Bringing my bag to my front, I opened it and inspected the chanterelles. They smelled tart, earthy, maybe sweet, but certainly not rotting.

Something was off, though. The firelight of the mushrooms I had observed when plucking them from the stream never really seemed to dissipate. It was as if they were glowing from some luminescence under the darkness of my bag. As I gazed closer, it wasn’t that simple. They were pulsing, like heartbeats. My head drifted closer into the bag, until my entire vision were the mushrooms, glowing, beating, so faintly and subtly I wanted to draw even closer to understand whether what I was seeing was real or just an imagination. 

Badum, badum, badum. The chanterelles pulsated. 

Snap. A sound came across the stream. I dared not look behind me. I wasn’t a superstitious man, and living alone in the woods had taught me that the things that went bump in the night were usually just rabbits and possums. But something felt so, so different. My pack seemed to beat quicker against my chest as I withdrew my head. I had to leave. I didn’t know why, but I had to. I started walking, my feet trudging through the wet grass, seemingly not able to find the grip they once had on their way in. I slipped and stumbled against wet undergrowth as I gripped and pulled through wet boughs. Farther and farther away from my stream. 

I quickened my pace. The rain was heavier now, sharp, like silver needles blurring my path and picking at my hood. A feeling of dread pierced me. The foliage was dense and unrecognizable as I prayed that the game-trail was behind every bush, every pine. Looking back, I don’t know why such a sudden fear overtook me from just the sound of snapping twigs. But the ice that gripped my heart at that moment compelled me to return to my cabin as quickly as possible. 

Until I cleared the next layer of brush, I had no reason to be afraid. No trail, again, but rested on a low hanging branch perched a raven unlike any I had ever seen. The top of his head was tufted, like a black jagged crown atop his head, giving him a regal presence as he stared. But it was how he stared that was the most alarming. The creature had whites in his eyes, highlighting the murky brown that made me freeze. His pupils were rectangular. The beast just stood there, staring, head turned, looking at me straight in the eyes. The beating rain was incessant. I refused to blink under his gaze.

“What?” I asked, to the non-sentient creature. 

He perched only 5 feet from me, and the tension between me and this thing cut the air like knives. 

“What!?!” I shouted at it.

Those awful eyes turned to my right. I looked. Water pooled in puddles between the dark pines. Dead leaves floated in clusters. I looked back at the thing, and it was still gazing that way.

Snap. A twig broke from my left. My eyes instinctively darted to it. A shadow broke among the pines, a standing shadow that blended in with the rest, darting quickly between those that stood still. It moved soundlessly, leaving only a blur of mist in its wake. The hair on the back of my neck bristled and froze. Before I knew it, I was running, more like a shambling jog on the thicket. My boots clashed noisily against the puddles, spraying water that leaped all the way up to my knees as I covered my face with my right forearm, blinking constantly to try to free my vision. Branches clawed at my sleeves, and the smell of rotting fruit seemed to permeate through the forest. I spat rain.

After what seemed like an eternity of my desperate scrambling, I tripped. The soft grass that hit my face certainly didn’t feel that way. I laid there quietly, listening to the rain as my nose dug into mud. Finally, I looked up. A brown twisting serpent clung to the floor. The trail. Bitter adrenaline shot into my veins as I quickly rose to my feet. Mud littered my jacket and I saw it on my cheeks in my peripheral. I resumed the run, following the path quickly as the ground was easier to push myself through. It wasn’t long before I saw what felt like heaven itself. The trees broke, and the mist that swirled through the pines seemed to dissipate at its edge. I crashed through, and instantly the air was soft and open again. What the hell was I even running from? A bird?

The snaps had faded, but my heart was still pounding, and I tasted copper in my mouth. Putting my arm to my forehead once more I searched my surroundings. The cabin was there. But something else was as well. A car was parked on my path, nose facing the cabin, both tires dug into the grass that had been no more than a shod of gravel for walking. I didn’t even have a license. I approached cautiously. 

There, arms crossed, was a woman leaning against my window. Her hair was black, her eyes hazel, and her lips were pouty. I stared. She stared back at me, just like that god damn bird. I walked in silence towards the rail, looking up at her until I neared the steps. Finally, she spoke.

“So this is what you do now?”

I looked down. My jacket was caked in mud. Strips of wet grass clung to my hair that stuck to my cheek. My nose was covered. 

“I got lost.” I stammered.

She scoffed, rolling her eyes and tightening her arms closer to her chest. I felt the disappointment in her as she looked me up and down. 

“What are you even doing here?” She asked in a sigh. I sighed too.

“Do you want to come in?” 

I climbed the steps in silence. I could feel her watching me. I wanted to tell her to leave, that she didn’t belong here, that her cropped jacket was stupid and impractical, but instead I pulled at the latch and opened the door. She took a peek inside, stood there for a few moments, and then went in. I went in after her. 

The moment I latched the door, the sound of the rain fled, and the constant ringing of my ear finally leaving put me at peace. I leaned against the logs and breathed deep. I was so glad to be indoors and not being pelted by water I had completely forgotten the woman sauntering around my kitchen, picking up my one pot in her hand and inspecting the bottom of it, while her other traced along my counter-top. She took the few steps to the other wall, bending down and opening the stove-door with her long nails. I looked at her dismissively. 

Finally, she made her way to my bed, sitting on the edge of it facing me and crossing her legs. I placed my pack on the ground next to the door. She looked up at me with a smile that would almost come off as polite if her eyes moved with it at all. 

“So.. This is what you do now.”

I sighed again, walking past her towards the slump in the corner of my room. I turned on the camp shower and felt the cold rainwater hit my face once more. I wiped with both palms, wrenching the mud and grass off my face before forcibly pushing it off my jacket. It clumped together on the dirt floor of the hole. She didn’t say anything else, and I was the first to speak as I buried my face into a soft towel I had on the shelf next to me. 

“Do you want coffee?”

She scoffed again. Annoying, I thought, so annoying. She looked around the room again, before looking at me puzzlingly. 

“Is this about Mom?” She asked.

I rolled my eyes, grabbing the pot she scrutinized and turning on the camp shower again, filling it near the brim before shoving it into the stove, kneeling down and retrieving a lighter from the top of it to light the tinder I had already prepared. The fire brought warmth to the room that my sister could never hope to achieve.

“Mom didn’t even care about us.” I retorted.

“So then why do this?” She put her palms up and looked around to make a point.

“I like it here.” I stared at the fire.

“You don’t even have air-conditioning.”

“You’re so stupid.” I argued.

I stood up, facing her with the fire at my back as I took off my jacket and placed it on the ground next to the flames. 

“Is that why you drove all the way out here? To make fun of me? How did you even find this place?”

She smiled and turned up her chin at me. 

“Your card was used for a few months at that market down the road. All it took was a few questions before I found that fat guy. Is he your family now?” 

“He’s a friend.”

“Oh I know, believe me. It took only about two minutes before he invited me to dinner.”

I didn’t respond, and that must’ve angered her. She snapped, clapping her hands together.

“Stop dodging my questions! What are you doing out here!? Playing survivor in the woods? What’s wrong with you!? First I hear you get a promotion to middle-management, and then next I hear you quit and then your phone is off and…” 

I zoned out. She trailed on with countless questions about my absence. I wrapped my hand around the same towel as she pattered on and retrieved my pot of boiling water from the stove. I dripped it through my primitive filter and through the ground beans into two cups, then brought it to her as she was still talking. She didn’t react, so I placed it on the shelf next to my bed, and sat down in a crude chair next to the fire. She stopped talking as I finally responded.

“It wasn’t about mom. I hated my life. I was late every fucking morning because I couldn’t get out of bed.  I was miserable. Didn’t you notice? Every single day. The same fucking thing. How do YOU live like that?”

She stared at me for a moment with those annoying hazel eyes, and shrugged.

“So this is the solution? Build a cute little cabin, make a fire, put a shower in it and what? Hang out with an old guy the rest of your life? Am I going to find you dead here one day?”

“Probably.”

She stood up, her fists clenched as her nails dug into her own skin. I saw the anger and feeling of betrayal in her eyes as I stared blankly. Steam rose from her lonely cup.

“Well go die then! See if I care!” She pointed at her chest. “I’m not the one who gave up, that’s what you did, you gave up! You had a few bad days and ran away. Does that remind you of anyone?!” 



I knew she was speaking about our father, but I never knew him, and he certainly wasn’t anything like me. Even if she had any memories of him, she was only a few years older than me, so I doubted they meant anything. Why should I care if she thinks I’m like him?

“No, it doesn’t remind me of anyone.”

“YOU are an idiot, Jack.”

She pulled at the latch to my door. It didn't open. I sighed, putting my palm over hers and pushing the latch sideways so it actually unhinged. She flinched as we touched, and I quickly pulled away once it was free. The door opened to a cool breeze flying inside. It was traded for her as she quickly made her way down my stairs. They looked rigid, more clumsily made than I remember, like a child playing with sticks as she made her way down. A wet black feather clung to the top step. 

She didn’t turn as she walked to her car door, boots splattering the rain as it dampened her hair. Finally, she looked back, and I couldn’t tell if there were tears in her eyes or just rain. Her voice was ragged.

“I love you Jack, please take care of yourself.”

“I love you too, Rosa.”

The forest and I watched her leave.

———————————

Several days past before I would venture into those woods again. They no longer seemed as homely as they had once. The bright, shining rays of light that would bounce between the leaves now cackled in hues of dark gray that seemed to sharply cut from branch to branch. A harsh wind was blowing out of them at all times of the day, and at night it sent an ominous whistle that made me shiver as I relieved myself at the edge. And the rain. The rain never stopped. Every day I expected it to part. Every day I was disappointed. For the next few days, the only thing that broke the monotony was the return of that old dog.

I saw him first before the storm came, and never expected to see him again. Old, skinny, black and blind. He had droopy ears and a long dark snout with white bristles at the tip fitting for his age. One of his eyes was scarred, and the other white with cataracts. The dog walked with a limp, quite efficiently as one would expect someone who has had an injury for a while would. His ribs gauntly poked from his sides, and I could only wonder how such a poor decrepit thing managed to survive. 

The first time, staring through my glass, I only watched him. He roamed across the grass, his nose sniffing at the ground, idly chasing some invisible scent. Like an ant following a false trail, he walked in circles, on and off the gravel until I grew tired of watching the scene and stood up. I opened the melted icebox underneath my counter, and retrieved some smoked hare wrapped in plastic. But when I turned to open the door, he was gone. I stepped outside to scan for him, and down the road I saw him paddling along, nose to the ground and sniffing away at the dirt as he limped down the path. That was the last time I had felt the warmth of the sun, while calling for him. 

But here, in the middle of this never-ending storm, he returned. 

I was quicker this time. No need for my last hare if he left. The door opened with a loud creak, and there he was. Roaming in a circle outside of my cabin, and for a moment I smiled. Normalcy at last! 

“Hey!” I called in as friendly of a tone as I could muster.

The hound’s body was soaked with water, dripping to the floor like udders from a cow. The only long fur he had was on his chin, matting his beard that looked as if he had just dunked it into a water bowl. I called again, but he made no attempt at responding. He continued to roam, one more circle, sniffing so close to the gravel I worried he had been inhaling rocks. So I just watched him, not like there was anything better to do with my phone dead. Finally, I grew frustrated. Was he deaf?

“Hey, come on!” 

This time I patted my leg afterwards. His head immediately turned, and he began to nonchalantly began to limp towards the steps, not so much as sparing me a glance as his nose continued to smell the ground. I stepped outside, figuring I would have to carry him up the steps, but just as idly as he began to walk towards me he climbed them, barely putting any weight on the left paw that ailed him as he reached the top. The door was open, but he stopped at the window next to it, sniffing the plank under it with intention. I tilted my head as he did the same. And then he turned, and limped on inside.

Figuring he was not one much for conversation, I came through and latched the door shut after him. He quickly found his way to the stove, slinking his skinny torso between the legs of my chair, lying down with his tail and thigh next to the softly burning flames. He made no sigh that I expected from other dogs who found a comfortable spot, simply closing his eyes and going still. I retrieved one of the few remaining strips of hare I had left from before my last encounter in the woods. He didn’t react as I approached him, placing it at his nose. His eye opened, and I could see the clouds of white up close. Like a soft fog they obscured anything resembling a pupil, and I found myself overcome with pity at the thought of such a creature. How horrible it must be to lose your grip on vision and not even to know what was happening. 

He sniffed once at the strip, and I grinned wide, happy to share with my new neighbor his first meal in what I assumed was a long time. Instead, he outstretched his left paw, touching the strip of jerky with calloused pads. His nails were dark and blunt, long and crooked. and there was some kind of crimson coming from between his pads. I knelt down and looked closer. Blood, old, but not very, coming from the middle of his paw. I looked at the others. His back legs looked fine, but I could not see his right, being folded against his chest. I reached out, and he did not react, so I gripped his skinny arm gently, and stretched it out. Blood, again. What the hell? A soft splatter of crimson stained the inner sides of his pad and matted the soft fur. I pushed on his paw gently to get a better look, and once again he did not react. There was some wound between them, and I couldn’t possibly tell what in the low light. So instead I got some antibacterial wipes out from my shelf, wiping both paws clean as his eyes closed and he remained motionless. After I was done, I waved the strip of jerky in front of his nose again, which he sniffed, opened his eyes, and closed them once more. He didn't pant, didn’t whine, didn’t even breathe loud enough to hear over the crackling of the stove.

I spent a long while looking at him as I stripped and got into bed. Motionless, he slept, while I tossed and turned, assaulted by the breaking of wood lost to flames and the patter of the storm through my window that seemed to grow only louder the quieter it got. When sleep finally found me, it only made me feel worse. Vines, horns and eyes. Roots coiled around my throat, tasting of iron and spores. That's all I dreamed of.

1on8pgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/KratomVibes/comments/1on8pgf/anyone_have_tips_for_using_kratom_to_stay_focused/,Anyone have tips for using kratom to stay focused?,"I've been diving into kratom blends recently, trying to find something that can help me zero in on my work without the jitters that come with coffee. I picked up some strains from 42 Degrees in Omaha and have been experimenting with them for a couple of weeks. Honestly, I'm not sure if it’s the kratom working or just my brain playing tricks on me, but I've noticed some differences.

I’ve been sticking to the classic white strains like White Maeng Da and White Horn. For me, about 4-6 grams seems to hit the sweet spot where I feel a nice **lift in energy** and focus without getting too wired. I can’t say I’m hitting productivity levels like a caffeine-fueled robot, but I feel more in the zone. The **clean energy** definitely beats the post-coffee crash that's become all too familiar.

That said, I’ve also noticed a couple of downsides. If I push it and go for higher doses, I end up feeling jittery and it can get a bit overwhelming. Plus, some days it just doesn't work. I’ve had times where I tried to blend different strains, thinking maybe a bit of red or green would balance things out, but sometimes it leads to a weird energy mix that doesn’t help at all. It’s all about finding that balance, which is easier said than done.

I’ve been lurking around r/kratom and it seems like a lot of people have their routines down. Some say that certain blends work better for focus, while others swear by consistent strain rotation. I’d love to hear what you all do—do you have a go-to blend that helps you stay on task? Or maybe some tips on dosing?

1on8otx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/1on8otx/madeira_14_day_hiking_update_and_report/,Madeira 14 day hiking update and report,"Good morning,

A few weeks ago I posted my 14 days in an Osprey Daylight 26+6 plan. Below is my original post - [https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/1nx4221/two\_weeks\_ion\_madeira\_osprey\_266/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/1nx4221/two_weeks_ion_madeira_osprey_266/)

I would say I really did a great job, I had about three items that I could have left behind. Two items I did not wear at all, running gear, I hiked so much that I never ran. I did laundry every few days, fabrics all were easy dry.

The dress i packed was a total MVP, wore it most days. Might buy more as It washed so well. Dressed up and dressed down

The Osprey was perfect, I was able to use it fully compressed on the way there, the big zippered side works like a compression cube. I filled it, and then zipped the expanding zip closed. That made the bag very compact. It went in the overhead easily, as it was my only bag. On my return I used it expanded as I bought some food gifts.

Weather was all over the place, from 25c and sunny to 10c and rain with howling winds. Here is the list, with highlights. Madeira is a fabulous hiking destination, but you do need clothes for all weather. Each day my folding backpack carried rain gear, a head lamp (for tunnels and caves, lunch, hats and sunscreen.

\- \[x\] Plug adapter - f  
\- \[x\] Garmin cable  
\- \[x\] Headlamp for the many tunnels  
\- \[x\] Battery pack  
\- \[x\] Ziploc bags - for packed lunches - huge win here for saving money  
\- \[x\] Grocery bags - one would have been fine

1on8ob7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1on8ob7,"London to Scottish highlands road trip with dog, June 2025","After years of being teased by my American friends for never having been to Scotland despite living in London for over a decade, I finally planned a proper road trip with my husband and our dog. 

Since I don’t drive, all the driving fell to my husband (poor man). The route was: London Gatwick (as they picked me up straight from a work trip to Valencia) → York (1 night) → Glencoe (4 nights) via lunch at Ullswater and coffee at Loch Lomond → Braemar (2 nights), stopping at the Highlands Folk Museum → Scottish Borders (1 night) with a distillery and Scone Palace en route → London, with lunch in Durham. 

In retrospect, the York-Glencoe drive was too long for one day, and four nights in Glencoe was overkill. Two would have been enough. We used Glencoe as a base to go to Fort William, Oban and generally exploring some of the surrounding area. I think the experience of using one place as a base would have been better had we not been unlucky with our hotel choice (expensive, unfriendly (even hostile, it later turned out), with no views, yet had a 4.9 on Google reviews and Tripadvisor). The scenery there was stunning, but midges and ticks, grey weather and unfriendly service did take some shine off. Fort William was fairly blah (but I had read as much), though the woodland/lochside walk to Inverlochy Castle, with glimpses of the Harry Potter train, was surprisingly lovely. 

That's enough the negatives. Here are our highlights and happy surprises: 

* The drive from York to the Lake District: absolutely stunning. 
* Lunch at Another Place in Ullswater: great pizza, dog friendly, and gorgeous lake views. We wished we could have stayed overnight. 
* A boat trip in Oban: dog friendly, excellent crew, and we saw a wonderful pod of porpoises, seals, a salmon farm and all manners of sea birds. 
* Walking around the base of Ben Nevis: we had zero expectations of this, as most reviews online say this is a waste of time, but it was surprisingly beautiful (and empty, as we went around 7 pm).
* The Highlands Folk Museum: this was just meant to be a brief stop but it turned out to be unexpectedly fascinating and incredibly welcoming (even to dogs). We spent a solid couple of hours there. 
* The Fife Arms in Braemar: what a gem. Original Picassos and Bruegels on the walls, yet zero pretension or snootiness. They wiped muddy paws with a smile. The drive through the Cairngorms to get there and our walk with a ghillie through Balmoral's grounds was also wonderful. We also got very lucky with the weather: 26 degrees and sunny.
* Lindores Distillery: a newer whisky distillery but steeped in history, with dog-friendly tours and great whisky (even for a non-whisky drinker like me).
*  Durham Cathedral: absolutely stunning and historic, and they allow dogs inside (urs literally tried to pull us through the doors)!

All in all, despite some frustrations, it was a trip of beautiful landscapes, memorable walks and excellent dog-friendly stops. We were careful to not let him off the lead unless it was asbolutely safe, given there were lambs around.  

We caught heatwaves in North England, Cairngorms and Scottish Borders (so everywhere but Glencoe), so my clothes from my Valencia work trip came in very handy! I had pakced cosy cashmere and wool for Scotland but I would have melted in those.  

Next time I’d split time between the Lakes, Edinburgh and a return to Fife Arms, skipping Glencoe altogether. Perhaps Isle of Skye or heading further north at some point too (the north coast looks beautiful, but very far).",13,1762167248.0,travel,2,1.0,False

Many people rely on coffee to wake up, but did you know that the timing of your coffee before exercise can make a big difference in your performance? Drinking coffee too early or too late might leave you feeling jittery or tired instead of energized.

You’ll discover the best time to drink coffee before your workout to maximize energy, focus, and endurance. Keep reading to learn how to make your coffee work for you, not against you.

# Benefits Of Coffee Before Exercise

Coffee before exercise offers several benefits that improve your workout. It acts as a natural stimulant to prepare your body and mind. Drinking coffee can make your training sessions more effective and enjoyable. Below are some key benefits of having coffee before exercise.

# Boosting Energy And Focus

Caffeine in coffee quickly boosts energy levels. It stimulates the central nervous system to increase alertness. This helps you stay focused during your workout. Better focus means improved technique and fewer mistakes. Coffee can reduce feelings of tiredness, making it easier to start exercising.

# Enhancing Endurance And Performance

Coffee helps increase endurance by reducing perceived effort. You can exercise longer without feeling exhausted. Studies show caffeine improves muscle strength and power. This leads to better performance in activities like running or lifting weights. Drinking coffee before exercise helps push past your limits safely.

# Supporting Fat Burn

Caffeine boosts metabolism and encourages fat burning. It helps your body use fat as a fuel source during exercise. This can aid in weight loss and body fat reduction. Coffee also improves the release of fatty acids into the bloodstream. This supports longer and more effective fat-burning workouts.

# Ideal Timing To Drink Coffee

Timing your coffee intake before exercise can impact your workout performance. The right moment helps boost energy and focus. Drinking coffee too early or too late may reduce its benefits. Understanding ideal timing ensures you get the most from your caffeine.

# Optimal Window Before Workout

Drink coffee about 30 to 60 minutes before starting exercise. This allows caffeine to enter your bloodstream. Peak effects usually happen within this timeframe. Consuming coffee too close to workout might cause jitters. Too early means caffeine effect could wear off during exercise.

# Differences For Exercise Types

For endurance workouts, coffee 45 to 60 minutes before helps stamina. Strength training benefits from caffeine 30 to 45 minutes prior. High-intensity workouts may require a shorter wait time. Adjust timing based on the workout’s length and intensity. This helps maximize caffeine’s energy boost.

# Adjusting For Personal Sensitivity

Some people feel caffeine effects faster than others. Start with coffee 60 minutes before exercise if sensitive. If you tolerate caffeine well, 30 minutes might be enough. Notice how your body reacts and adjust timing. Avoid coffee too late to prevent sleep problems.

I had a difficult birth and had a very big post partum haemorrhage so was very tired and low blood count after the birth. I’m pumping and giving all expressed milk as I struggled to nurse/ directly breastfeed.

I have quite a calm baby (I think) but I find most days I don’t really feel like leaving the house especially with the cold weather. I sometimes go for a quick walk in the local park or the high street but don’t venture that far. I also still feel so tired and don’t have much energy. If we have guest or I do much, I feel my energy is zapped.

Im actually quite happy just being at home with my little one. Also feel in between feeding/ nappies/ pumping/ eating there isn’t all that much time.

Should I be going out/ doing more?
I don’t really feel like going to baby classes or groups at the moment because he is quite little and naps are not that predictable. Planning to sign up to some when he is abit older (perhaps after Christmas like baby sensory). We also have NCT reunion coming up. I’d be happy to meet others for a coffee but don’t feel desperate too and I’m quite happy at home with baby.

Just feeling abit guilty that I’m not getting out/ going more. But I also think at this age this stuff would be more for my benefit than his.

The Buffalo Bulls (-1.5) and Southern Miss Golden Eagles meet on November 3, 2025, in a game so tightly contested, it’s like two overcooked hot dogs racing to the fridge. The total points line sits at 153.5, which, in college basketball terms, is about as exciting as a tax audit. Let’s unpack why this game is shaping up to be a defensive slugfest and why Buffalo’s slight edge might just make them the smart bet.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You’ll Actually Enjoy

Buffalo is favored by a measly 1.5 points, which is about as decisive as a tie in a game of rock-paper-scissors. The implied probabilities? At DraftKings, Buffalo’s moneyline odds of -112 (converted from decimal 1.76) suggest a 54.5% chance to win, while Southern Miss’ +105 (decimal 2.1) implies 47.6%. That 7% gap is smaller than the difference between a “free throw” and a “free coffee” from your barista.

The total points line of 153.5 is a defensive number if we’ve ever seen one. For context, the 2024 national champion UConn Huskies averaged 75.2 points per game—this total is 18 points *higher* than their season average. So, expect a game where both teams will be shouting, “Defense wins championships!” while secretly wondering if anyone told the offense to show up.

### Team News: Injuries, Quirks, and Why the Eagles Might Be Golden in Name Only

Buffalo’s offense? It’s like a golden retriever in a chess tournament—well-meaning but hopelessly out of its league. Last season, the Bulls ranked 287th in scoring (68.3 PPG) but 142nd in defense (66.8 PPG allowed). Imagine a team that’s great at stopping you from scoring but even worse at scoring themselves. Their star guard, Jalen “The Human Tripwire” Thompson, recently admitted he tripped over his own shoelaces during a practice layup. Not inspiring.

Southern Miss, meanwhile, is the basketball equ

1on8eny,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTPhilippines/comments/1on8eny/new_in_metro_manila_alone_and_lost/,"New in Metro Manila, alone and lost.","How can I meet other LGBT people and build friendships as someone new to Metro Manila?

Hi! Sorry, this might be a long one.

I’m a 33-year-old guy who just moved from the province to Metro Manila for work. Back home, I lived a pretty secure life — under the same roof as my family, with a stable job/profession, and surrounded by close friends who were just a message away (our province is small, so meeting up was never an issue). I’ve always been a naturally-sociable person.

A few months ago, I accepted a job opportunity here in Metro Manila and brought almost all of my things with me. I’m now staying in Quezon City, while my long-time best friend since high school lives in Makati. At first, I was thrilled — finally living alone, being independent, and having the freedom to do whatever I want, whenever I want. I was ecstatic.

But after a few months, reality hit me. My best friend now thinks QC is practically another country and never visits me. Life here moves so fast that I barely get to connect with the people around me. I don’t have friends who can introduce me to new circles. Sometimes, I even question my extroversion whenever I think about joining events, just because I don’t know anyone nearby. On top of that, people at work seem to draw a strict line between professional and personal relationships.

# 1. Introduction

To gain a better understanding of the background of Buddhism in Java and in Indonesia, it would be better to read my previous posts about Buddhism. But to briefly summarise, Buddhism has had a long history in Java island. One of the earliest Buddhist Temples in the island is in [Batujaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batujaya) (Karawang, West Java), which was built around the 5^(th) Century AD, and is still being used by the local Buddhists for celebrations during Buddhist holy days, such as Waisak ([*Berita Kantor Kementerian Agama Provinsi Jawa Barat*](https://jabar.kemenag.go.id/kanwil/umat-budha-rayakan-waisak-di-kompleks-candi-batujaya-karawang-wC9azb)).

[A modern-day Waisak celebration in Candi Batujaya \(Karawang, West java\)](https://preview.redd.it/e6orq7ye20zf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=999b7d08196a793491bf3137f460f1ee61b2739a)

Buddhism peaked during Indonesia’s classical Hindu-Buddhist period, but after the fall of Majapahit during the 16^(th) Century, Buddhist institutions declined, making way for the spread of Islam.

However, in Java, Buddhist philosophy and meditative practices did not fully die out. The Javanese people embraced Islam but kept their Hindu-Buddhist traditions alive through art, literature and certain practices. For example, the practice of meditation (semedi) is still done by some Javanese even to this day, even though they profess Islam or Christianity as their religion.

When the Dutch came to colonise Indonesia, they were fascinated with Java’s Hindu-Buddhist past, and so they began to study it, and in the process, they rediscovered many ancient temples. Furthermore, many ethnic Chinese were migrating to Java, and they brought with them their Confucian-Buddhist traditions. Thus, during the colonial period, there was an intense interaction between Javanese Hindu-Buddhist traditions and Sufi Islam, Chinese Confucian-Buddhist culture, and European Philosophy.

These interactions would culminate in the rise of the [Theosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophical_Society), a trans-national and trans-continental organisation dedicated to “seeking the truth” from the world’s religions.

The Society was formed in British India but soon spread around Asia due to the colonial connections forged by the British Empire. Soon sections of the Society sprouted in places such as British Ceylon (Sri Lanka) British Singapore, and from there, to Dutch Java. The Society attracted members of all races: Europeans, Indians, Ceylonese, Peranakan Chinese and even Javanese aristocrats. This process of “Trans-National Connections” is succinctly described and explained in **Yulianti’s Book:** [**The Making of Buddhism in Modern Indonesia: South and Southeast Asian Networks**](https://books.google.co.id/books/about/The_Making_of_Buddhism_in_Modern_Indones.html?id=TeG10AEACAAJ&redir_esc=y).

One of the society’s goals was to “revive Buddhism” in Java. The efforts of the society bore fruit, as by the early 1900’s, there were a considerable number of native Javanese, Peranakan Chinese and some Europeans who identified as Buddhists. Most notably, when the restoration of Borobudur was finally completed, they were able to organise Indonesia’s first modern day Waisak celebrations.

A very important person who was influenced by Theosophy and its efforts to revive Buddhism was an ethnic Chinese from Bogor named Tee Boan An, who later in life would be called [Ashin Jinarakkhita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashin_Jinarakkhita). Born in 1923, he was already interested in spirituality from a young age. He pursued higher education in the Netherlands in 1946 and came back to Indonesia in 1951 to work as a teacher. Two years later, he was ordained as a novice Buddhist monk.

Jinarakkhita had a natural talent for teaching and blending Buddhism with Indonesian traditions. However, his biggest feat was to save the newly-revived Indonesian Buddhism from the Communist Purges of 1965.

After a failed so-called coup which was blamed on the Communists, the Indonesian Government was taken over by the military and persecuted everyone and anything that was deemed Communist. Due to pressure from Muslim and Christian groups, the Indonesian State persecuted beliefs and traditions that did not conform to their idea of “religion”, which could be used as an excuse to purge “godless” Communists.

In order to prevent the persecution of Buddhism, Jinarakkhita appealed to the government. He looked to ancient Javanese Buddhist texts and found the concept of “Sanghyang Adhi Buddha”. [Ekowati (2012)](http://www.undv.org/vesak2012/iabudoc/05WilisFINAL.pdf) explains that Jinarakkhita’s promotion of Sanghyang Adhi Buddha as the Buddhist equivalent of “God” was a “skilful compromising” in order to ensure Buddhism’s survival in Indonesia. The ancient Javanese were already familiar with such a concept, thus Jinarakkhita merely “reintroduced” it to their descendants.

Therefore, Buddhism came to be accepted by the Indonesian Government as a “legitimate” religion. Many Abangan Javanese (nominally Muslim Javanese) who were previously persecuted because they were accused as atheists formally converted into the religions that were made official by the government, including Buddhism. This is why to this day; there are many villages scattered in Central and East Java whose inhabitants are ethnic Javanese Buddhists.

# 2. Buddhist Villages in a Muslim-Majority Island

According to [Demography of Indonesia's Ethnicity (Ananta et al., 2015)](https://bookshop.iseas.edu.sg/publication/2084), in the year 2010 more than 90 thousand ethnic Javanese Buddhists were recorded in the census. The bulk of these Javanese Buddhists are spread around Central and East Java. Below is a map from **Ehipassiko Foundation** (an Indonesian Buddhist NGO) that shows villages throughout Indonesia which have significant Buddhist populations:

[Map from Ehipassiko Foundation showing where their volunteers go to for charity work in Buddhist-majority villages](https://preview.redd.it/trzjyagr10zf1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=640b0eaaad2e15b7ebf26965aad1b5c7f6736472)

Most of these Buddhist-majority villages are rural and agrarian. They are barely distinguishable from the other Muslim-majority villages, with the exception that in the Buddhist villages, women don't wear hijabs, and that there are Buddhist viharas in place of mosques. I have personally visited one such village in Yogyakarta and have done charity work there.

The Buddhist Javanese get along well with their non-Buddhist neighbours, since they are practically the same people, eating the same foods and speaking the same language. However, one point of possible contention arises when the issue of economics and marriage come up. The following is a quote from Roberto Rizzo (2024) [Keeping Hold of the Jewel: Buddhist Youth Activism and Multidirectional Migration in Mountain Java](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385070899_Keeping_Hold_of_the_Jewel_Buddhist_Youth_Activism_and_Multidirectional_Migration_in_Mountain_Java), during an interview with a Youth Buddhist Activist from a Javanese village:

>Not only could he be considered an urbanised or highly mobile young adult, but he himself grew up in a Christian school and was on the verge of abandoning ‘the way of the forefathers’, which is the phrase by which, interchangeably, both the Javanist tradition and contemporary Buddhism as are often talked about.

In Indonesia, Muslim and Christian organisations have vastly more resources, and importantly, more adherents. Thus, Muslim and Christian schools are available even in the most remote villages of Java, and sometimes these schools are the only accessible forms of education for the Buddhist Javanese. Furthermore, when Buddhist Javanese marry non-Buddhists, there is a natural pressure to convert.

Thus, there is a sense of urgency among the Buddhist Javanese that their numbers are dwindling. This is especially the case among the youth, which is why many Buddhist Youth Organisations have sprung up in Java's villages. For example, this is an article talking about [Pemuda Buddhis Jepara](https://buddhazine.com/pemuda-buddhis-jepara-satukan-niat-lestarikan-buddhadharma/) and how they hosted an event in 2022 that was attended by over 200 Buddhist Youth.

[A Buddhist Youth event in 2022 by Persatuan Muda-mudi Buddhis Jepara \(PMMBJ\). Notice the red-coloured uniforms worn by the girls at the back, and the boys at the far left of the photo.](https://preview.redd.it/knsj10ny90zf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f5538b6bab8e550dc5eb5c89f956ffa17ed09f9)

The Buddhist Youth take advantage of the tools that are available to them in this modern age: social media and the internet. Whereas before, Buddhist villages used to be remote and isolated from each other, now, communication can be done in a matter of seconds, and events can be organised through video calls and meetings.

Besides that, Buddhist villages are now connected to the Buddhists living in major cities such as Jakarta, Semarang, Malang and Surabaya. These cities host large Buddhist organisations which have many resources, such as the previously mentioned [Ehipassiko Foundation](https://ehipassiko.or.id/), the famous [Yayasan Buddha Tzu Chi Indonesia](https://www.tzuchi.or.id/), and many others. Through the internet and social media, Urban Buddhists and Rural Buddhists have forged important connections.

# 3. Urban-Rural Symbiosis

Thanks to the collaboration between Buddhists living in the cities and the villages, there have been many programmes in which both sides interact with and complement each other.

For example, many middle-class Buddhists who go to Buddhist schools in cities such as Jakarta and Surabaya will organize live-in trips to one of Java's Buddhist villages. [*Live In Siswa Sekolah Tri Ratna Jakarta di Dusun Sungapan, Pengamalan Ajaran Buddha di Tengah Masyarkat*](https://buddhazine.com/live-in-siswa-sekolah-tri-ratna-jakarta-di-dusun-sungapan-pengamalan-ajaran-buddha-di-tengah-masyarkat/)

[Urban Buddhists, who are mostly ethnic Chinese, staying at a Javanese Buddhist village](https://preview.redd.it/2w7xuldig0zf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5552cc7e1fe6d952e63f6bc3c02ff3c5ea981ff)

In fact, when I was studying in Yogyakarta for my Bachelor's degree, my local Buddhist Youth Group organised a charity event in one of Jogja's Buddhist villages.

Buddhist networks in the major cities also help the rural Buddhists who want to get jobs. If you go to a large vihara in Jakarta or the Greater Tangerang area, it is very likely that the people responsible for taking care of the vihara and maintaining its upkeep are ethnic Javanese Buddhists. I remember going to a big vihara in BSD, and one of the people taking of the vihara was a person called Mbak Kus, who lives in the vihara along with her husband, her son and her nephew.

Another example of economic symbiosis is the case of a Buddhist village in Temanggung where coffee is grown:

>A few ideas for locating areas of economic potentiality (*potensi pemberdayaan*) in Temanggung were derived from a workshop attended by Sura in Central Jakarta. The workshop was organized by Institut Nagarjuna, an interdenominational Buddhist NGO devoted to promoting a liberal and progressive understanding of the *dhamma*, referred to as *dhamma kontekstual*. The institute also collaborated with local NGOs to promote the *dhamma* and improve the living conditions of the *umat*.

>For Sura, coffee and earwood mushroom cultivation were particularly strategic areas that could be developed in Temanggung and would generate the greatest benefit for residents in the medium to long term. Coffee, in particular, was a highly profitable field that could enable Temanggung Buddhists to participate in the widespread enthusiasm and trendiness surrounding coffee production and consumption in Indonesia at that time. (Roberto Rizzo, 2024)

That village is called Dusun Krecek, and they have a website if you are interested in buying their coffee: [Seputar Krecek - Seputar Pangan](https://www.seputarkrecek.com/produk-pangan).

# 4. Case Study: Dusun Krecek in Temanggung

I want to highlight Dusun Krecek in particular, because in my opinion, this village is the pioneer among the Javanese Buddhists villages. In fact, Dusun Krecek is the main focus of Roberto Rizzo's studies on Javanese Buddhism, especially his book [Buddhism in Indonesia | A Study of Multiple Revivals](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003389514/buddhism-indonesia-roberto-rizzo) (2024).

The Pemuda Buddhis in Dusun Krecek have been the motor which inspired the youth of the other Javanese Buddhist villages. This can be seen through the fact Dusun Krecek is the headquarters of [Buddhazine](https://buddhazine.com/), Indonesia's leading website for Buddhism-related news.

[Buddhazine's Headquarters, founded on December 2011](https://preview.redd.it/jpu54gvmk0zf1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=49416f345a0bbd03ae02c88fe11d554655b869fd)

To reinforce the point about urban-rural symbiosis, the founders of Buddhazine were locals from Central Java who graduated from Sekolah Tinggi Agama Buddha in Jakarta. Through Buddhazine and the Buddhist Youth, Dusun Krecek has been able to reinvent itself from a sleepy Javanese village into an interesting tourist destination.

The residents of Krecek emphasise their identity as being a Buddhist Javanese Village, thus, the village blends Javanese forms of art with their Buddhist identity. Every house will have a Buddhist altar in front of them, and gamelan performances are routinely held. One attraction is the Krecek Waterfall (*curug* in Javanese), a place that is often used as a place of meditation (semedi) for visitors to the village. In fact, Krecek hosts several festivals and events throughout the year, such as:

1. [Nyadran Perdamaian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWSlXi7ITM0) \- an event usually held at the beginning of the year, inviting people to participate in Nyadran, a Javanese ceremony to honour the ancestors and have a communal feast.
2. [Yearly Waisak Celebrations](https://mediacenter.temanggungkab.go.id/frontend/d_berita/4410) \- thousands of Javanese Buddhists usually gather in Krecek to jointly celebrate Waisak.
3. [Ruwat Sukerta](https://buddhazine.com/ruwat-sukerta-di-bulan-suro-kembali-digelar-di-dusun-krecek-temanggung/) \- celebrated each year to herald the Javanese New Year (Satu Suro), the rituals in Dusun Krecek blend Javanism and Buddhism.
4. [Festival Dusun Krecek](https://bimasbuddha.kemenag.go.id/festival-100-tahun-merti-dusun-krecek-lestarikan-budaya-berita-1230.html) \- a yearly festival to commemorate the founding of the village, which is celebrated with artistic performances of gamelan, kuda lumping, wayang kulit, and other forms of Javanese traditional art.
5. [Krecek Mindfulness Weekend](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNk1j2nxbbd/) \- a retreat to teach people meditation and enjoy Krecek's nature.

And many more.

As of the time of writing, Krecek is developing rapidly and is still innovating in various ways. For example, [Buddhazine has recently been offering Mandarin lessons](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPldl0Aklgq/?igsh=MTZjOGs0ZDA3MjE4cQ%3D%3D), taught by a person who has lived in China for more than 10 years.

# 5. Conclusions

Personally, I think now is the best time to be an Indonesian Buddhist, especially in Java's rural villages. Thanks to the contributions of the various Buddhist organisations, a network of Urban and Rural Buddhists have been forged, not just in Java, but also throughout Indonesia.

I hope that Dusun Krecek can continue to pioneer innovations, and that other Buddhist Villages can reinvent themselves like Krecek, whether it is through growing crops such as coffee, or becoming spiritual and cultural spots for tourism.

Thank you for reading my post, and if you have any questions, please ask and I will be happy to answer them.

I’m f40 and my whole life has been like a fucking fever dream. 

I resigned from my job a few months ago because I went through a lot of mental exhaustion, in a car accident and been incredibly sick and on top of that, management were not supportive at all and didn’t really see me as a human being. I decided to leave that place so I could give myself a break before I start working somewhere else, I now cannot find a job anywhere, I constantly get rejected, I have zero money to my name, no car, no driving license and I live with my parents who are both super narcissistic. I’m just so incredibly drained from everything going on and there’s nothing I feel I can do about it. I also don’t have any friends, no partner. I have no support in my life and it’s really fucking painful. I can’t even remember the last time I had a hug from someone. I can’t do the things I like anymore, can’t get my nails done can’t get my hair done or get fancy coffee etc, I used to be able to do all that for myself and treat myself. I don’t feel like myself anymore, I have quite a feminine personality so I like doing all of those girly things. I’m trying my absolute best to apply to every damn job in any sector, I spend most of my waking hours applying for jobs and it’s driving me up the wall. 

The past few weeks I have either been sleeping throughout the entire day and night or not sleeping at all for days at a time. Two nights ago I slept for around 32 hours, my mum came to check on me and she thought I was just coming down with some sort of sickness, I woke up once or twice to shut my window because it got cold

I don’t wanna do this anymore. I don’t know where to start and I don’t know when this cycle will end. I completely give up. 

I’d really appreciate some nice words from you guys or if you could give me any advice on what I should do. The truth is I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this",0,1762166008.0,confession,4,0.22,False

“You probably don’t check this account, if it’s even yours. But if it’s meant to, it’ll reach you. And maybe it’s better if it doesn’t so I don’t disturb whatever corner of happiness you’ve built. Even if it’s wrong, even if it makes everything worse. Even if you don’t care for me at all any more, I have to say it. Start to finish. I’m promising myself this is the last message I’ll send. This will be my actual closure not asking for you back like in the past. I’m going to honor the feelings and try to finally let them go.

I’m sorry, that I didn’t see your struggles. I’m sorry for the stupid comments I’ve made even if you don’t remember them. I’m sorry I “moved on” after such a short amount of time. I genuinely thought you were ghosting and never coming back. I have thought of you so much. I have times where I’m okay and times where I miss the you that I knew so much and regret everything I did to lose you. I was immature and I’m sorry. I didn’t know how to have a healthy relationship but with you I really tried. I miss everything I can remember about you. The last few years have been so hard, I’ve been depressed more than happy. With you, I was happy. I ruined it in the end and pushed you away but I was happy. Everything felt so right. You never screamed at me or threw things at me or cheated on me or made me cry on purpose. And I loved you. I truly did with all my heart. I was scared to say it because I was scared that you didn’t feel it too. I was scared I was becoming too much for you and I made it worse. I was young and foolish. I have wished so many times that I can go back and do it all over. Or at least go back to that December in your apartment and make it right instead of running away. I have missed you so much. I still miss you. I try not to. I have tried and tried and tried to forget you. I’ve tried to reach out and rekindle things with you. I’ve failed at both. You’re in my head and my heart and my therapist said this should be an unsent letter so I can let go. I can’t have two sets of feelings. God how I miss you. And maybe it’s because I wasn’t with you long enough for the honeymoon phase to wear off but it felt right. The late nights watching movies and you’d make dinner sometimes. Running errands and the coffee you were nice enough to bring me that morning. I still remember the first time I stayed ove. I’ve wished so much that the person coming through my door was you. I’ve settled for years and it’s been toxic and I’ve paid that price. I’m probably missing you more because I’m contemplating ending it soon. Maybe the older I get, the more I’m terrified to be alone. But in my mind I’d always hoped you’d reach out and say you missed me too. That you would “rescue” me. The ghost of you will not let me forget. I know it was so long ago and I likely look psychotic but I’ve never been able to get over it. I deeply regret a lot of my actions. I have issues with being alone and when you left, I begged and begged until I couldn’t anymore and I tried to replace you to forget you. There is no one like you that could. If I broke your heart and that made you give up when you came back for me, I’m sorry. I genuinely would have left them when you first came back if you asked. Genuinely. I hadn’t even known them yet. Not like I knew you. It had only been a week. I never knew how you felt and it scared me and I behaved irrationally. I don’t have the willpower yet to block you back but I’ll commit to leaving you alone. I hope you are happy, wherever you are. I wish it was with me. I wish it always was me. I wish I was the text you’re looking forward to when you wake up today. I wish I was the person you’re saying goodnight to. But I still hope you’re happy all the same. Sorry about the off and on messages over the years. And all that stupid stuff I did in the past. And I hope whoever loves you now is getting it right, from the beginning.
