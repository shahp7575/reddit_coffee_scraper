1gypopu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gypopu/cant_get_over_even_a_year_after/,Can't get over even a year after,"The title.

I tried dating. Tried to build more of my life. Haven't achieved much, in fact I had the biggest losses in my lifetime and one big win due to emotional turmoil. During the breakup the other person made me feel like I'm not good enough. I convinced myself I'm good enough since I started dating the day after, but reality hit me like a truck when I had no romantic nor sexual success even after a year. I feel like I don't have anyone to support me in my mental and physical struggles.

I suppose I'm to blame since I didn't want to listen to the usual advice on breakups and past relationships. I wanted to do things my way. Didn't go no-contact at first, tried to stay as friends, hooked up once with them, went to a few 1-on-1 coffees with them, and didn't stop the conversation when troubles from our past relationship came into the topic. Ultimately had a big argument that made me distrust my friends. We both decided to go no-contact for a while. I even still view their public profile and the reality of dating and not being good enough of a partner hit me again. I don't feel good enough compared to other people of my sex.

But the contact never came back. She had a few partners in the meantime, I had none. My ego hurts, and I know I became less attractive in the meantime and didn't develop as a person. In a way I'm worse. 

I think it's in part that despite it being a long-term relationship we rarely managed to be together physically. Life and career got in the way, along with personal mistakes. I felt there was something deep in them that I can connect with... but it felt like they were scared of ever showing their true nature. They felt like they weren't good enough in ways I couldn't care less about, and sabotaged things I did care about. But in rare cases when they opened up completely, without worrying... things were soo great. I wanted more of that and I doubt I can meet someone like that.

It feels so painful to not be a part of life of someone you still love. Even if it was an unhealthy love.

1gypnob,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gypnob/google_maps_ratings_ruined_my_travel_experience/,Google Maps ratings ruined my travel experience,"Whenever I travel, I always rely on Google Maps. I pick dinner spots based on ratings, find breakfast places the same way, and choose bars accordingly. At least in Europe, it’s quick and convenient—I don’t have the time or resources to dive deep into researching local restaurants and cafes.

But I’ve realized these ratings are killing my travel experience. There’s a decent bar for coffee and sandwiches, but a 3.9 rating makes me skip it. A 4.2? Well, there’s a 4.3 restaurant across the street, so I’d rather go there. But if you dig into the reviews, you’ll often find complaints about things like the staff not speaking English, which isn’t really a big deal for me (I just got back from Spain and I speak Spanish).

Another issue with these ratings is that they kill any desire to explore. I’m unlikely to step into a simple local coffee shop with old chairs if some tourist gave it a 1-star review because they didn’t serve caramel iced frappuccino lattes or speak English. But what if visiting that coffee shop would’ve given me a unique experience or helped me meet new people?

I ask this because I've been having countless dreams lately that I'm aware of and it sounds similar to astral projection but I've only astral projected once I think.

I guess I'm asking is there proof? Has someone had someone write a note and put it upside down on a table in the other room and you go over and read it? Have two astral projectors had the intention of meeting in the same spot and speaking? If it's real why wouldn't that be a common goal to meet other projectors.

1gyplg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1gyplg2/it_feel_surreal_that_its_done/,It Feel Surreal That It’s Done,"I had my hysterectomy on Tuesday (11/19). So 4dpo-ish? Robotic Assisted. Everything but the ovaries. I had it done because I have multiple autoimmune issues and the problems that come along with that AND unfortunately living in a red state (blue city). My periods were never “bad” but becoming a tad bit irregular (for my liking). My hormone levels were normal and nothing out of the ordinary on the ultrasound. (I’ll list my conditions toward the end for those curious).

I was losing 3 weeks of my life every month. My energy and body would crash the week before, the week of, and I would be recovering the week after. And by the time I was feeling vaguely like myself, it was coming around again. Like, I already have so few “good” days, I was done also planning around my period.
But also, I needed permanent BC.

I realize I may still experience some of that as I kept my ovaries since I’m in my 30s. But it will still have to be better than what I was already living with.

I will say mine was simple, straightforward, with no complications (no endo, fibroids, cysts, etc.) But for anyone curious for experiences here’s how mine went and is going:

I did take about 4 hours, some walking, 3 bags of fluids, 2 apple juices and a bottle of water to finally be able to urinate post-op. So don’t try and rush it too much. I’m also chronically dehydrated on a good day, so that doesn’t help me, lol.

If you have long hair and you’re able to get your hair up into a couple of braids before surgery (like French braids or whatever works for you) it can keep your hair out of the way for a good while.

Don’t be afraid to ask for more anti-emetic in recovery if you need to (like zofran). 

I also hope everyone gets a bair hugger heated hospital gown. That thing was amazing!!! 

I was expecting the gas to be the worst thing, but it was actually my throat that was the most painful thing for 2 days. Like, I knew my throat would hurt, just wasn’t expecting it to get as bad as it did. Ultimately, Gas-x was a waste for me. 

I started a non-stimulant stool softener the morning after surgery and have taken one every morning. I didn’t have a movement until Saturday morning with the help of hydration, juice and coffee. 
As my doctor said “you’re going to have to put in some effort. But also don’t force it, especially if constipated.”
I would also not try to rush this, as it wasn’t until Saturday that I was comfortable even to be ABLE to reach around. I’ll definitely continue taking the softeners while I’m on the pain meds. I am also glad I did not feel anything move over my cuff.

Protein shake, lunchables, and small easy things  like the muffins or frittatas from ‘Veggies are Great’ have been a life saver.

As someone who does not like straight prune juice, I did find an apple prune juice combo by Gerber. Technically for toddlers and only in little 4oz bottles. So you may need 2 at a time, but it’s worth it. Getting 2 separate juices to mix seemed like a waste for the amount of time I’ll need it.

I did get Always Discreet postpartum disposable underwear. Even though I haven’t been bleeding aside from the spotting that first day, it offers peace of mind and one less laundry item. 

Walking around feels good, but there is a fine line before “over doing it” hits me.

Lounging at an angle is better than sitting. Sleeping on an incline with the help of pillows has been helpful.

I regret not attempting to do tricep dips or squats a months prior to surgery. You’ll need those muscles in place of your abs.

The 3 hour alternating pain meds that my doctor put me on have been great, but I feel stiff all over if I oversleep a dose. Alternating tramadol and extra strength Tylenol every 3 hours so they’re both taken every 6 hours.

I also personally have not felt any of my insides shift to fill the space either.

Claritin (or Zyrtec) with Benadryl cream for medical adhesive allergies. (I am not putting the cream on the sutures but around the edges of the large bandage coverings.)

Overall though, even through the pain meds, everything at this point, I just feel really sore like I did an intense workout for the first time in forever, including my vagina. It isn’t bad, but still nervous to come off the meds. (I am a big baby lol)

I’m also super thankful for my doctor. She said it wasn’t her first choice for permanent BC because of the risk of prolapses, but admitted that salpingectomy(sp? plus pain meds) or ligation could make periods worse, and a failed ablation could ultimately lead to a hysterectomy anyway. She didn’t care that I didn’t have kids and she didn’t need the approval of my spouse either. 
So we proceeded, I went in there expecting more resistance than I got, but I think she saw how set I was, and agreed.
It really should be that simple for everyone, and it makes me smad that it isn’t. 

If anyone is also curious as to the various conditions that led me to this decision I have no issues discussing/disclosing that either. I have:
* HS (groin flares and periods are not fun, also hormonal BC options flared my HS, and my Rheumatologist did not want me on hormonal BC either).
* Autoimmune Hypothyroidism 
* IgA Nephropathy 
* Sjögren’s 

It’s hard to tell what caused what, or what came first but because of these I also have secondary conditions like: osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cholesterol, and arthritis.

Not a sympathy grab, but rather if someone is debating yeeting their uterus due to autoimmune conditions or other health issues but has a “healthy” reproductive system, I’m happy to provide my background and experience.

Ultimately, only time will tell if it was worth it. But I have a good feeling.",1,1732450256.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for some creative and thoughtful birthday gift ideas for my partner, and I’d love your suggestions! He’s 29 and has such a range of interests that I’m a bit overwhelmed trying to find the perfect present. Here’s a bit about him to spark some ideas:  

* **Gaming & Board Games:** He’s into both video games (Rounds, Deadlock, Cult of the lamb, Plague inc., Balatro) and board games. Some of his favourite board games are Brass and anything Cthulhu-related.
* **Specialty Coffee:** He loves brewing and experimenting with coffee.
* **Watches:** He’s a fan of nice watches and owns a Tudor Black Bay, Brew Metric, and Seiko Alpinist.
* **Music:** Loves bands like Brand New, American Football, and also has a soft spot for ska. He plays drums and guitar as well and owns a few synthesisers.
* **Books:** He enjoyed World War Z, House of Leaves, and SILO. Movies: His favorite is The Shining (he’s a big movie buff in general).
* **Cooking:** He loves to cook and experiment in the kitchen.
* **Sentimental About Family & Friends:** He’s the type who really cherishes memories and meaningful connections.

I’d like to get him something thoughtful, useful, or unique—something that reflects his personality and passions. Budget-wise, I’m flexible, but I’m open to both big and small gift.",1,1732450051.0,Gifts,0,1.0,False

I was very happy when i received it, but quickly realized it was defective. I had the ""add beans"" error of the grinder, which caused the porta filter to completely overflow with ground beans and the machine would not dial in. As there are more and more reports of that error on the internet, it seems that its a common issue with the machine. I sent it back with the option to get a replacement. 

I was sad i had to send it back, because here in Germany it was sold out in 10 minutes when it was released. After a week of having it sent and getting no info of it arriving or anything else, i email customer service when i can expect a replacement. This was their answer, translated from german:



>Dear Mr. Snizzelz,

>Thank you for your inquiry to SharkNinja.

>We are sorry for the inconvenience you have experienced with your order: X

>We confirm that we received your return on 23/10/2024, unfortunately we are not yet able to proceed to replace your ES601EU Expresso machine free of charge as there is currently no stock available. Your request has been reported to the relevant department and at this time no further information is known regarding stock levels of the new Expresso machines. 

>Taking this into consideration, there is certainly the option to refund your order if you so choose. 

>(Please note that refunds can take between 5 to 10 working days to be credited to the original payment method used).

I am thinking: okay its a shitty situation, but i can wait. 

Now, one month later, **still no replacement. Even better, this week they were back in stock and you could order them from their site! But no indication, E-Mail or anything of the replacement being sent.** 

So naturally, i get a little frustrated and send them another E-Mail if i get my replacement now that its back in stock. Two days later i get this E-Mail:

>Hello Snizzelz,

>Thank you for contacting SharkNinja. I am pleased to be able to help you with your request.

>As the product was out of stock, we have refunded you the full amount. You can now place a new order as the product is back in stock.

>The refund should be credited to your payment method within 5-7 working days. We hope you can place an order soon and enjoy our coffee machine soon.

>Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.

>Yours sincerely,

What the fuck? What sense does this sentence make? ""We were out of stock, so we couldnt send you the replacement. But now its back in stock, so heres your money, just buy it."" Why dont you just send me the replacement when its back in stock?? Why refund me 1 1/2 months later? Naturally, its sold out again of course, so i cant even order it now.   


Did you have similar experiences with the machine or the company Ninja? Or is it cause im in Germany and customer service doesnt exist here? Im really reconsidering if i want to buy it again.

1gyp5ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/Deliverance/comments/1gyp5ci/pastor_here_testimony_story_about_deliverance_and/,Pastor here: Testimony / Story about deliverance and a dream that followed.,"Good morning, y'all,

This one's quite a ride, so strap yourself in. So, a little about me. I'm 42 years old, I've been in full-time ministry for three years and lately, it seems, that God has been moving in mighty ways on one hand, and the enemy has been crouching at the door on the other.

**Full Story**

Around six months ago, I received a baptism of the Holy Spirit (long story, I was always an *intellectual* Christian in a very mainline protestant denomination but had never received the baptism of the Spirit). I was praying over someone else for healing and started praying in tongues for the first time in my life. The 'intellectual' part of me shut it down, and another pastor in the room stopped what we were doing, and a group of clergy prayed over me, realizing what was about to happen.

About a week later, I had a dream that I was being chased by something demonic, woke up in a panic, hit the prayer closet, and prayed for deliverance for the first time in my life... Felt like I was on the verge of something, but probably too young in my walk in this sort of ministry to really understand the authority that I have in Christ on that level. It'll always be funny to me how I could be a nominal Christian with this spiritual baggage for the first four decades of my life (probably didn't always have the baggage), but as soon as I'm baptized in the Spirit, God takes me to the woodshed.

Fast forward three months, our church is moving in the right direction. I'm even teaching on things such as deliverance (in a small way), and all of a sudden, things seem to be falling apart. We had a fire at our church. Almost immediately after that, a good friend of mine who is very in the Spirit revealed to me that the Lord spoke to him, saying that we have become the target of some witches in our community and they are praying against my family, and the church.

To top it all off, during all of this, my wife is pregnant. About five-six weeks ago, my wife had a dream where tentacles were coming out of the baby and trying to hurt her. We didn't think anything of it until two weeks ago when we went in for an ultrasound and found out the baby had passed away around the time of the dream. During the ultrasound, twice, as I was watching the screen, I saw what I can only describe as a demonic or ghoulish face. I was very unsettled by all of this, and of course, folks who haven't lived in this life wrote it off as hogwash.

During this time, with all of the stress of everything going on with the fire and the pregnancy, my 'addictive personality' came back in full force. I've never been a drinker or a drug user, but I struggle with gluttony and compulsive behavior. It has always been a struggle because when I get into that 'mode' nothing can stop me, it seems. Which is why I've also struggled with weight my entire life.

I spoke to a mentor I trust after this and he turned me onto some resources about generational curses, things that the minions of Satan may have had legal permission to inhabit me over that I *haven't* addressed, and they may not even be things that I've been explicitly doing.

Once again, I hit the prayer closet and I asked the Spirit to reveal anything in me that is not of the Lord. God showed me that I have some real messed up stuff on my dad's side that falls in line with the sin I struggle with, that would really fall under the influence of something like Leviathan or an Octopus Demon. I mean, my dad was not only dabbing in freemasonry, but he also literally ran a bondage dungeon in his garage. I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not. I have a real jacked up family history.

I prayed through a multitude of prayers on this site breaking generational curses and strongholds, and fell back in my chair. I started to pray in the Spirit, and as I was doing so, my hands went up and I started convulsing. I kept praying, and praying, and praying through the convulsions until they stopped. After that, I felt such a lightness around me that in light of everything going on, I turned on some worship music and literally felt like dancing. In that moment, I felt like I had assurance that God had delivered me from those generational curses.

Here's the real kicker. Since everything started getting awful, there has been a cat that has been hanging out on our porch. I rarely catch it, but it's clawed our chairs and seems like it has spent a *lot of time* at our property over the past three months. The day after deliverance, I woke up and there was that cat, staring at me through the kitchen window... I mean like... I was four feet away from the kitchen window making coffee and this cat was staring into my eyes from a good twenty feet away. I looked at that cat and quietly said, 'If you are a monitoring spirit, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ and forbid you from entering this property"" and the cat just hightailed it out of there.

Then, the last piece of it all. Last night (which is what inspired me to post), I had a dream, where I was in my dad's old house (where all the messed up stuff happened) and I saw a bunch of snakes. I systematically removed every snake I could from that house, and at the end, I found a den of snakes that were dying, and removed them as well. When I woke up, I had peace for the first time in a long time. I believe that's the Lord signifying that yes, those generational curses have been broken.

Sorry this is so long. I'm long-winded. It's sort of what I do. Anyways, thanks for the resources here, and praise God for the truth that we have power in the name of Jesus.

I spilled a double espresso in my wooting 80he. Immediatly unplugged, screwed open, got the coffee out, cleaned everything as described in the wootings guide, let it dry completly. The keyboard works again now, and I think everything should be fine with the tech.  
  
However, the stabilizers seem to be different compared to the 60HE or rather there are some small stickers below the stabilizers, for sound dampening (I guess). For the space bar, these were completely soaked in coffee and became really sticky and were soft, so I had to remove them. Now my spacebar sounds different then the other keys, more similar to the 60HE.   
I applied a bit of lube to the bottom where the stickers were, which made it a little better.

Now my Question:

Is there any replacement for these stickers, or what would you recommend instead to restore the sound?



Bonus question:

I wanted to share my experience and tips on mixing and matching furniture for your living room since I recently went through a complete living room makeover. Trust me, it's not as daunting as it seems!

First off, let's talk about the foundation. Your sofa is basically the star of the show. I recently found this amazing piece (https://athometouch.com/sofa) that completely transformed my space. Whatever you choose, make sure it's comfortable and sets the tone for the rest of the room.

Here's what I've learned about mixing and matching:

1. Start with a color scheme
Pick 2-3 main colors and stick to them. I went with navy, cream, and gold accents. This keeps things cohesive even when mixing different styles.

2. Play with textures
Don't be afraid to combine different materials. I paired a velvet armchair with a leather sofa, and threw in some woven baskets for good measure. It adds depth without looking chaotic.

3. Balance is key
If you have a modern sofa, try adding a vintage coffee table. Too many statement pieces will make your room look like a furniture store display.

4. Unite through patterns
When mixing patterns, vary their sizes. I use large prints on throw pillows and smaller ones on curtains. They work together because they share colors from my main scheme.

5. Consider scale
Make sure your furniture pieces are proportional. I learned this the hard way when I initially bought a tiny coffee table that looked like dollhouse furniture next to my sofa.

One thing that really helped me was finding versatile pieces. Speaking of which, I found some great options here (https://athometouch.com/sofa) that work well with different styles.

Pro tips I wish I knew earlier:
- Keep larger furniture pieces neutral
- Use accessories to experiment with trends
- Don't forget about lighting - it ties everything together
- Leave enough walking space (at least 30 inches between pieces)
- Group furniture to create conversation areas

The biggest mistake I see people make is trying to match everything perfectly. That's not how you create an interesting space! Think of your living room like putting together an outfit - not everything needs to be from the same store or collection.

Remember, there's no strict rulebook. What matters is that you feel comfortable in your space and it reflects your personality. Start with quality foundation pieces and build around them gradually.

1gyoorj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1gyoorj/not_making_the_best_of_wfh/,Not making the best of WFH,"This is definitely another post similar to others. So, if you're not into reading about the woes of working from home (or likely underlying issues), then please ignore this post. I'm just looking for a few others who were maybe on the same path as me. I'll try to be brief and this isn't supposed to be a feel sorry for me situation, I genuinely don't need it. Just providing some facts and looking for some concrete steps to help.

I worked somewhere for 10+ years. Loved it but the pay was horrible. It was one of those 1% per year increases places. Couldn't afford a home and didn't see retirement coming. The constant promises of change and a possible increase of pay eventually led me to completely crashing. I didn't see it coming. It was almost instantaneous and I was on leave for 6 months. 

Coming out of this, I knew I needed change. Luckily, my self study choices led me to a much better posting career. It was going to be revolutionary. Work for an established company that needed a new department, for which I have the expertise. A dream come true. It was fully remote and to start in ?mid-late 2019. I knew that I needed to maintain a social network and, since I got along with my friends and bosses at my previous employer, I was able to go in to join them for the day (which also vastly helped with my changeover). Then, COVID came and with it, isolation.

I tried to stay motivated. Lots of outdoor time. Connected with friends but, after months and years, it eventually faded.

I'm still with the remote with good pay. My supervisor is great, the tasks are great... but I'm just losing the will to live. I've talked to psychologists and it just doesn't seem to aid me. I'm highly logical and a perfectionist* and trying to think in an unstructured ""what is really wrong with you"" way isn't really working.

These days I get up, have my coffee, put on my music and try to do the best I can... but I'm just about out of steam. I'll go weeks without real contact with anyonr outside of my wife, and I know it's on me... My world has just become so small. It doesn't feel like I can break out of this cycle. 

*One thing I have to clarify is on the perfectionist, as I think it really is the root of where I am. I've run into people who have claimed to be perfectionists, and sure there are likely different definitions. For myself, I have always strived to give 150% (again, a baseless claim without proof). I had the highest grades and the most accolades during elementary school, high school and post+secondary. I was offered paid schooling through scholarships and through the bosses at both places where I worked (one offered to pay for my MBA). I was a bodybuilder, runner, and was the social person who brought my friends together. 
I take on every project at home because I want to learn from it. You name it, I do it (and I made sure to code). However, I look at this as a big disadvantage and not something to be proud of. If you've met a true perfectionist you can see that they likely aren't happy with any result. There is always something to try to be better at, something to learn... and it seems that self-care just never makes it on that list. 

Work from home has allowed all of the worst things about me to manifest themselves because I am being held accountantable to myself and, with my mood the way it is, I feel that if I can't do something well, I just don't have the motivation to do it.

Anyhow, just had to vent. I'm not suicidal, I'm just not sure what's the point. I don't want to leave my present position as it provides security for me and my family I didn't have before. I just need to figure out a wfh system before I feel even more isolated, my productivity drops too much or I spiral downward even more. 

Thanks for reading ☺️

She's a bit different to me, but we seem to get on well the few times we've met to discuss work stuff, and we had quite a long talk about hobbies by text the other night. It's still very much just a working relationship right now outside of that conversation. Essentially, I'd like to get to know her more. It's a bit early to go for a literal date at this point as I still don't know her well at all, but would it be a huge mistake to just ask if she'd like to get a casual coffee or something? If she were to say yes, great, but what do I do if she says no? My natural reaction would be to just kind of carry on like I never asked with the knowledge that at \*that\* point it would be inappropriate to try again, but are the odds good that she would see it the same way?

Black Friday 2024 is a good time to find deals on mug warmers. They’re useful for keeping drinks hot and can make a nice gift for friends and family (the electric ones can be a nice gadget :))

I did a quick survey of the top sellers:

* **\[Best overall electric mug\] Ember Mug 2 (14oz)** \- The Ember Mug 2 maintains your drink’s temperature (120°F–145°F) for 80 minutes or all day on its charging coaster. App-controlled or standalone, it’s durable, hand-washable, and water-resistant.
* **\[Value for money electric mug\] Nextboom Nextmug** \- The Nextboom Nextmug offers three preset temperatures (130°F, 140°F, 150°F) with a long-lasting battery and charging coaster. Simple to use, it features auto-off and LED temperature indicators.
* **\[Budget mug warmer pad\] Lerat Coffee Mug Warmer** \- The Lerat Mug Warmer features a large heating plate, three temperature settings, and an auto shut-off after 8 hours. Includes an 8oz ceramic mug, perfect for desk or home use.

Just make sure you don’t buy one just because it’s discounted, make sure it’s a good fit, otherwise it will go to waste. You can [check out this page](https://requiremints.com/guide/best-mug-warmers/) for top picks and free advice from the team on WhatsApp. (I advised the team there to review mug warmers, just to note.)

1gyom5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1gyom5d/which_alternative_tokyo_neighbourhood_to_stay_in/,Which alternative Tokyo neighbourhood to stay in for 4th visit?,"On our 3 previous trips we've stayed in a number of Tokyo neighbourhoods (usually two per trip as we fly into and out of Tokyo so we top and tail the trips and will do same for next trip). Previously we've stayed in Asakusa, Shinjuku, Ueno, Maranouchi (and also in Yokohama and Narita, which I know aren't in Tokyo!) And we visited various areas including Ginza, Omotesando, Rippongi, Shibuya, Tsukiji etc.

On our next trip, I'd like to stay in one of the neighbourhoods that we often see suggested as being a great alternative (for exploring or to stay). 

We are looking for an area with lots of great eating options (casual rather than ""fine dining""), coffee shops, varied indie shops (especially those selling arts, crafts and vintage homeware, we have zero interest in clothes/ fashion). No major sights necessary but a fun place to be based for breakfast, some dinners and just hanging out! It doesn't have to be a quiet neighbourhood necessarily, but preferably not majorly focused on nightlife, we're in our 50s and not much for late nights these days!

And I need good transport links to get to other areas of the city easily / fairly quickly.

I did a very thorough search through loads of previous threads here and pulled out well over 30 neighbourhoods suggested by members of this community. These included some threads where people were looking for fun places to explore, not just threads about places to stay. 

I've narrowed it down to a top 5 and a secondary list (I've excluded ones I've ruled out).

If anyone can help add extra info to help me narrow down my choice (given my criteria above), I'd be super grateful! 

TOP FIVE

* Asakusa (stayed here a few times, should probably move on, though could go for a different area within the neighbourhood)
* Iidabashi (described as pretty, peaceful and good for food lovers, but not sure what kind of restaurants it has, what it's like for cafes and places to have breakfast)
* Shimokitazawa (I know it's a younger, trendier crowd than us but the whole vintage and chilled vibe still appeals, I have read it's pretty crowded these days)
* Sugamo (love the idea of Harajuku for oldies)
* Yanaka / Yanaka Ginza (my notes tell me it's a traditional area, pleasant to stroll around, but what's it like for food?)

SECONDARY

* Akihabara (we aren't into gaming, manga etc. so should I just rule this out?)
* Daikanyama (appeals on cafes, delis, brewpubs side, but am put off by notes about high end shopping/ dining)
* Ebisu (appeals on casual food side of Ebisu Yokocho, but am put off by notes about designer shopping/ high end vibe)
* Kanda Jinbocho (drawn to book town, antique and curio shops, the student vibe, can't tell what it's like on cafes and food)
* Kiyosumi Shirakawa (described as recently modernised, trendy coffee shops, not sure if it's as good on restaurants etc)
* Koenji (pretty far out from central Tokyo, but like description of liberal, bohemian vibe with bars, restaurants, vintage shops, bars etc)
* Kuramae (drawn to modern cafes, young artist studios, shops, not sure what it's like for food)
* Nakameguro (drawn to stylish cafes, unique shops, lively area under train tracks, but need more info)
* Nezu (description similar to Yanaka, historical neighbourhoods, coffee shops, retro stores, snacks, what are eating options like?)
* Nihonbashi (managed not to explore this area when staying in Maranouchi previously, it sounds quite different, with specialist stores, good restaurants, but can't tell if it's all a bit high end shopping and eating)
* Nishinnippori (old school feel, contains textile district, amusement park, what is it like for cafes, shops, casual restaurants)
* Ookubo (like the idea of visiting both Korea Town and islamic area, but we recently spend 4 weeks in South Korea, think will prob just visit rather than stay here)
* Ryogoku (said to still have workshops making traditional crafts, also sumo stables, not sure of much else about this area on cafes, eating etc)
* Shibamata (nostalgic, but a bit far out, what is this area like to stay in for a visitor rather than a resident)

I usually just lurk here and have realised that a lot of my symptoms match the experience of users here so i would like to ask a question. 


Do energy drinks do anything for you? I ask because ive been having real problems with sleeping lately - im naturally an insomniac and I have a chronic illness which can cause sleep disturbances so its not exactly a *new* thing. But I’ve noticed that even when I’ve slept okay the night before, if I have coffee then within half an hour im falling asleep. So because ive been having these sleep issues, i thought I would try drinking an energy drink and see if it maybe helped at all. 


Spoiler alert: it didn’t. Its 11am and I haven’t slept, im starting to crash now so I probably will sleep soon but I was wondering if anyone else has this issue with energy drinks in particular? Coffee makes me sleepy but energy drinks make me feel like im having a heart attack. I dont know if its the extra stuff they put in them - b3 and whatnot - or if it was just more caffeine than I usually have and this is how youre supposed to feel, but it strikes me as odd that there are such different effects from the same substance.

1gyokmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1gyokmv/rant_accents_fluency_and_low_key_judgement/,"Rant: Accents, Fluency, and low key judgement","At a coffee shop and sat beside a table of young people. Mixed group, local born Viet, American VK.

The locals we're speaking in a really nice, fluent cadence, albeit with a highly noticable (though not altogether overwhelming) accent. 

The American VKs are probably from an ""interesting"" part of the US, specifically California. Speaking like a bunch of cholos and Bay area thugs. Like they belong in a movie that somehow has both Denzel, and Sam Jackson, along with Danny Trejo, but is also produced by Hallmark, and distributed by Disney? 

I was in equal parts really happy with the locals and how they were able to intelligently express themselves in a foreign language, and unjustifiably annoyed with the American VKs because they just sounded uneducated and uncouth. 

They just sound like cheap extras in the '90s movie based in Compton. 

I know I'm being judgmental here. And I hope none of them are on Reddit. Lol

Do any of the Viets here on this sub feel any specific type of annoyance for VKs who speak with a certain accent? I've met a lot of really nice VKs from the East Coast and the Midwest, and I never had this almost immediate annoyance.

For some reason, listening to this specific combination of accent and fluency from two different sides of the ocean really just makes me annoyed.

1gyokfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1gyokfa/a_former_friendship_drama_on_my_mind/,a former friendship drama on my mind,"I(24F) met this person, I'll call her A, through a hobby group, so we'd see each other every other week or so for about a year. We were never that close but she was friendly and closest to my age (2 years younger than me to be specific) and she seemed like a pretty regular girl and easy to talk to so I kind of saw her as somebody I could end up being friends with. We found out we had mutual friends outside of the group just by coincidence, so that made me trust her too but we never really got to the point where we were very close, but we had the kind of friendship/acquaintanceship where we'd get food/drinks before or after the workshop/meeting but not necessarily hang out outside of that zone and we'd reply to each others instagram stories but nothing more. I saw her as somebody who was friendly who I see a couple times a month but that was pretty much it.

A had been in the group for longer than me so she had closer friends in the group, and I kind of knew most people but didn't have close friends. I was more focused on the activity itself than socialising so it was fine, until I heard from a close friend of A, I'll call her B, from the group, that A told B and other people in the group that I tried to kind of sabotage/ruin A's project while they were getting drinks after a meeting. While crying in front of everyone.

All the situations B described sounded like a misunderstanding to me so I messaged A directly and in a very non-confrontational and polite manner that I heard such and such things from B, and I'd like to apologise if I messed up your project but i really didn't mean it and I sent her some proof for it.

(I don't want to make this post too long but if you'd like the specifics for more insight, our projects required some photography, and A told me she had never used DSLR before and she seemed like she was struggling using it manually so I helped her set it up. That was it. Just a friendly gesture, and I set up mine the same way I set hers up. Then B accused me of ruining A's settings to ruin her photos. and a bunch more stuff similar to this.)

So when B messaged me about all this she sounded very upset and accusatory and it really came out of nowhere, so I was a little flustered but I told B I'll apologise to A directly and I did. A wrote back that she was sorry to have talked about me behind my back and she now can see how it was a misunderstanding. Not a big deal, right.

But then A began to post on her ig story and twitter about how she keeps getting calls from an unknown number and she thinks she's being stalked. I didn't make a connection at first and I was worried for A for a bit as well, bc as a woman it did sound quite scary, then the posts about her ""stalker"" became more and more frequent and very specific. It was specific enough if we had mutual friends and saw this post you'd immediately be able to think the post is about me. A was mentioning getting phone calls all day, death threats in her dms from throwaway accounts, kinda serious stuff. (She never posted a screenshot or any proof of this harassment but it wasn't the kind of stuff you'd think anyone would lie about) And I could notice that she began to avoid me in the meetings and everyone in the group started to LITERALLY ignore me, they'd pretend not to see me, won't say hi back, almost middle school friendship breakup kind of stuff but also made sense if they believed I was doing the stuff she was posting about. Nobody really confronted me this time but A's posts were getting more and more specific and at the point you couldn't really deny it was about me, I messaged A again, saying I was sorry from the other time, and if any of this was about me I'd like to grab a coffee with you and make sure there weren't any more misunderstandings.

I wasn't necessarily popular growing up, but I never had trouble making friends and I had a pretty much drama-free social life up to this point so that was the best option I could think of. She replied back a couple hours later, she'd like that but she's a little busy this week because her parents were visiting town, but she'd let me know when she has time. I didn't really care about what the people in the group thought of me bc again, I was never really close to any of them, but I really needed her to stop posting about how I was harassing and stalking her especially because we had mutual friends outside of the group and I had known them for years prior to joining this group.

A week later, she and her friends from the group posts almost rant-like stories about me being a psycho bitch etc etc and A posted that she knew who ""you"" were and she was going to the police. Then I was immediately blocked on all social media. The situation kind of escalated over a span of few months until she blocked me, and no follow up afterwards. I'm not sure if she ever went to the police or if she had made the whole thing up.

So this is my question. This whole thing happened a year ago and I can't stop thinking about it. I don't consciously think of her or anyone from that group but I do have super stressful dreams surrounding her from time to time then it kind of ruins my day.

I only told a couple people about it but not to anyone who knows this girl because it's not something I necessarily want to revisit and although I still have no idea why she was thinking that, I know it's out of my control and it's something I personally can't make right of. I know I'm a little too old to be this obsessed with friendship drama and it's even weirder because I was never even close friends with her to begin with. I'm pretty introverted and quiet so I tend to swerve away from any drama so I've never really been put in a position anywhere close to this before, which is why I think I'm having a difficult time processing it. Also I don't go to the group workshop anymore but I see some of my mutual friends posting pictures with her on social media from time to time and when I see it I start thinking about the whole drama again. Now I'm writing this long reddit post about the whole thing because I'd like some advice letting this go from my mind. I have physically moved countries (not because of her ofc) and I have a completely different environment but I feel like my mind keeps pulling me back to an incident that happened with somebody who wasn't even special to me, a whole year ago. I am having some trouble building new friendships in the city I moved to so that might also be why my brain keeps revisiting old acquaintanceship/friendships.

tl;dr I(24F) was ostracised out of a hobby group because this one girl(22F) accused me stalking and harassing her. I still stress-dream about her and her friends from time to time one year later, and I'd like some advice on how to stop.

1gyogo9,https://i.redd.it/9btjzyzyyt2e1.gif,"Sunday November 24, 2024 - Word of The Day ""Patience"" • [Click to Expand]","## Patience: The Unsung Hero of Personal Growth and Resilience



Let's dive into a topic that's both timeless and incredibly relevant in today’s fast-paced world: patience. We often hear the phrase ""patience is a virtue,"" but what does it really mean to be patient? How can we cultivate this quality in our lives, and why is it so important? Grab a cup of coffee, get comfortable, and let's explore this together.

### Understanding Patience

Patience is more than just waiting for your turn in line or sitting through a long meeting without fidgeting. At its core, patience is about enduring difficult circumstances with grace. It’s the ability to delay gratification, to hold off on immediate rewards for something greater down the line. It’s about maintaining a calm demeanor even when everything around you seems to be spiraling out of control.

Think about the last time you had to wait for something important—maybe it was a job offer, a medical test result, or even just waiting for your favorite TV show to return. How did you handle that waiting period? Did you find yourself restless and anxious, or were you able to stay calm and collected? This ability to endure without losing your cool is what makes patience such a powerful virtue.

### The Role of Patience in Personal Growth

Let’s talk about how patience plays into personal growth. Imagine you're learning a new skill, like playing the guitar or mastering a foreign language. At first, progress might seem slow. You might struggle with finger placements or stumble over unfamiliar words. It’s easy to get frustrated and want to give up. But patience allows you to push through these initial hurdles. It gives you the perseverance needed to practice regularly and improve over time.

I remember when I first started learning how to cook. My early attempts were nothing short of disastrous—burnt pancakes, undercooked pasta, you name it. But I stuck with it because I knew that mastering cooking would be rewarding in the long run. Over time, my patience paid off, and now I can whip up a pretty decent meal without setting off the smoke alarm!

### Patience in Relationships

Patience isn’t just crucial for personal development; it’s also essential in our relationships with others. Whether it's dealing with a stubborn friend or navigating family dynamics during the holidays, patience helps us maintain harmony and understanding.

Consider those times when someone close to you is going through a rough patch. They might be irritable or withdrawn, and it can be challenging not to take it personally. Patience allows us to step back and give them the space they need while offering support without pressure.

I once had a friend who was going through a tough breakup. They needed time to heal and weren’t always up for socializing or chatting like we used to. Instead of pushing them to hang out or talk about their feelings before they were ready, I gave them space while letting them know I was there whenever they needed me. Eventually, they came around, appreciating that I had been patient with their process.

### The Challenge of Patience in Modern Times

In today’s world, where everything is available at the click of a button—from online shopping deliveries to streaming entire TV series—patience can feel like an outdated concept. We’re used to instant gratification and quick results, which makes practicing patience even more challenging.

However, this constant rush can lead to burnout and stress. By cultivating patience, we allow ourselves the opportunity to slow down and appreciate the journey rather than just focusing on the destination. It’s about finding contentment in the present moment instead of always chasing after what’s next.

### Techniques for Cultivating Patience

So how do we become more patient? Here are some techniques that might help:

1. **Mindfulness Meditation**: Practicing mindfulness helps us become more aware of our thoughts and emotions without immediately reacting to them. This awareness can create space between stimulus and response, allowing us to choose patience over impulsiveness.

2. **Setting Realistic Expectations**: Sometimes impatience stems from unrealistic expectations about how quickly things should happen. By setting more realistic goals and timelines, we can reduce frustration.

3. **Practicing Gratitude**: Focusing on what we have rather than what we lack can shift our mindset from one of scarcity (which fuels impatience) to one of abundance.

4. **Deep Breathing Exercises**: When you feel impatience bubbling up, take a few deep breaths. This simple act can calm your nervous system and help you regain composure.

5. **Reflecting on Past Experiences**: Think back on times when being patient paid off for you—whether it was waiting for the right job opportunity or seeing improvement after sticking with a difficult task.

### Conclusion: Embracing Patience as a Lifelong Practice

Patience is not something we achieve overnight; it’s an ongoing practice that requires effort and intention. But by embracing patience as part of our daily lives, we open ourselves up to greater resilience, deeper relationships, and more meaningful personal growth.

Next time you find yourself stuck in traffic or waiting for an important email response, try viewing these moments as opportunities rather than inconveniences—chances to practice patience and strengthen this invaluable virtue within yourself.

So here’s my challenge for you: find one situation this week where you can consciously choose patience over frustration or impulsivity. Notice how it feels different from your usual reaction—and who knows? You might just discover that patience truly is its own reward!

I told her that, after a lot of thinking, I now see more clearly what I did wrong, and that I regret that a lot.

It wasn’t heavy emotional or anything, just me sharing my thoughts and reflections, and asking her to talk things through.

She left me on read for two weeks, continued Tweeting a bunch of sad heartbreak stuff, and then replied: 

I’m doing well, I’m really happy with how things are going now. I don’t think there’s anything to talk through for me. But if you’re open to having a coffee as friends, we can. I just don’t want to give you false hope, as there’s nothing more in it for me than that.

Her message seems so conflicting with her social media behavior, and I wonder what’s the right move here. Do I go, keep it light and casual to see how she behaves in person? Or do I decline and move on fully?

I really want her back, but I also want to respect her decision and boundaries.

In the dream I didn’t know he was Jesus but there were signs it was him. Firstly, he told me his name was Jesus and he had these little, slightly bloody holes around the crown of his head. During this time, men in suits were looking for him. Despite him being calm, there was a sense of urgency. At one point, in order to hide him, we kissed with my head blocking his. At another point, he offered to pay the tip with some silver dollar coins but I told him the bill was on me as it wasn’t that much. I think we were in a place like Bertucci’s. We shared bread and olive oil; he had some sort of milky tea or coffee but never directly drank it. In the dream, he asked me to get something he left in a cave and I think I couldn’t find it; there was only some rags but he said he needed them. At one point I kept trying to wake up but he kept stirring whatever was in the cup and staring into my eyes. I wasn’t scared, just in disbelief that there could be someone as nice as him in the world. He seemed like any other man, just without the slightest hint of ill or question intent.

We both love traveling, enjoy coffee, and are homebodies. Another common denominator is that we’ve both recently gone through breakups with our respective partners. We’ve had great non-work-related conversations at the office. Although we’ve had a couple of chances to bond during in-office events, we’ve never had the opportunity to hang out one-on-one outside of work.

During one of our conversations, he mentioned that he’s in the talking stage with a couple of people but hasn’t met them in person or gone on any one-on-one dates. He said talking to others helps him cope with the breakup. He also admitted that he’s not ready to date anyone yet.

For me, maybe our similar experiences—like our recent breakups—make me feel closer to him. Or maybe it’s simply the proximity (same team, same office). There’s also a part of me that just wants to be friends with him since most of my friends are either overseas or married with kids. I sometimes feel lonely and crave the company of someone who shares my interests and enjoys life in similar ways.

Despite dropping subtle hints about my feelings, I don’t think “this” (whatever we have now) is progressing in the direction I’d hoped. While he occasionally compliments my looks (calling me “cute”) and teases me about kissing (though not directly), I feel the attraction might be mutual, but neither of us seems ready to admit it or take the next step.

That said, I’ve decided to focus on myself—on getting that promotion and staying committed to my graduate studies. I like him. I really do. But this time, I’m choosing myself. I’m not particularly religious, but I believe that if two people are meant to be—whether as friends or as lovers—they will find their way back to each other eventually.

So, to you, my office crush: I’ll leave a little thank-you gift on your desk tomorrow morning. It’s my way of showing gratitude for meeting you, for bringing joy during tough times, and for all your kind words. I hope we can remain good friends—or at least stay civil in the office. I’ll always treasure the memories, but I want to keep things professional moving forward.

I’m choosing to move on. Hopefully, when I read this again 2–3 years from now, we’ll both be in happy relationships and living the dream.",1,1732445597.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

Arthur Jefferson had to get to Valhalla, but his Uber was late.  He thought he had managed to operate this telephone contraption correctly, but so far there was no driver and no updates.  He composed himself in patience, sipping at some strange coffee and looking out onto Pico Boulevard.  Amai Coffee, the place was called. He imagined a scene, where his friend said something about Amai Coffee, and he replied *well I don’t think you are, but you might be tea*.  It probably wouldn’t work outside of Santa Monica, though.  

He had visited himself a few times, over at Forest Lawn, and even gone to see the stars.  He hadn’t found his old pal’s star, though. Artie looked a lot different in his beard, his glasses, and his ball-cap, emblematic of some sporting team or other, but he hadn’t wanted to draw attention by asking.  He avoided that.  He had worked as a fisherman, a warehouse loader, a hundred little careers, confining his creative outlets to those which could remain anonymous.  His *nom de plume* gave a hint, but not a good one.  

It hadn’t been a wish, exactly, or even an intention.  More of an insight, a realization.  The mysteries of the infinite had seen fit to let him reincarnate right here in Santa Monica--his new life beginning right where the old one had ended.  He wondered if anyone else had ever done it, and knew there was no way to find out.  *I’d rather come back as myself*, he had said, a century before.  *I always got along swell with me.*  And so he had.  Artie was seven years old before he remembered that.  He even wound up with the same name from his second set of parents.  Mysteries indeed.

But now he needed to reach Valhalla, and wondered if this driver would ever show up.  Artie was going to die again, and was not at all sure about a third go-round.  He had to go and see Babe before then, up at Valhalla Memorial Park cemetery, in North Hollywood.  In all his years--in either set of years--he had never gone.  He looked toward the window, but it became a silver screen of memory.

Artie still felt bad about missing his pal’s funeral, back in his earlier life.  But he had been ill, and knew Mr. Hardy would understand.  Still, the tears came, and Artie… or Stan, for this... retrieved his handkerchief.  *Gee, I’m sorry, Ollie.  Another fine mess I’ve gotten us into.*  His telephone buzzed, and a little blue car pulled up.  It was time.  He tipped his hat and tipped the waitress, and off he went to Valhalla.  Better late than never.

It's a very old website, I don't think it's updated anymore. I'll just copy and paste the content from their article about bad breath. They even mention about low stomach acid. Here you go: 



 ""Bad Breath

Causes

There are a number of causes of bad breath, foremost among them being bacteria in the mouth, stomach and intestinal disturbances, bowel sluggishness, sinus or throat infections, and tobacco and alcohol use.



• Alcohol consumption causes digestive problems which leads to bad breath. In addition, alcohol dries out the mouth, which reduces saliva production. See below for more information.



• Stress is another cause which may not be readily apparent when you are looking for reasons for bad breath. Stress affects the digestive system. An insufficient supply of digestive enzymes may be another cause.



• Other sources of bad breath are in the nose and the nasopharynx, the area above the base of your tongue.



• Dieting may be a cause of bad breath. 



• Since dehydration leads to constipation and digestive problems, it is very beneficial to drink 6-8 eight ounce glasses of water a day. Juice, coffee, tea, colas, etc. don't count!



• Bad breath may emanate from the back of the throat due to sinus or tonsil infections resulting in excess bacteria. If you have sinus or throat problems you may well have some form of allergy.



• Bad breath may also be the sign of potentially more serious medical conditions such as diabetes, duodenal ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux, hypoglycemia, kidney or liver malfunction, and respiratory disorders.



• The foods eaten also are a potential cause of halitosis. Certain foods, such as garlic, onions and certain spices are frequently cited as cause for a person's bad breath. Both vegetarians and those who eat large quantities of meat may develop bad breath due, in part, to the digestive process. Digestion begins in the mouth. Saliva has enzymes which begin the digestion process, and the type of food eaten can affect the food chemistry of the mouth. Saliva will also pick up odors from food within several hours after it has been eaten. Odors are strongest from carbohydrates - sugars, starches and cellulose, less strong from proteins, and nonexistent from fats. Bacteria in the mouth react with the decaying food and drink residue and can be the source of the foul odor.



• A milk intolerance often is the cause of bad breath. Eliminate all dairy products and see if they are the culprit. 



• The stomach also is an area that causes bad breath problems for many people. Poor digestion, constipation, or bowel disorders may create gas which exits the mouth. Not enough hydrochloric acid in the stomach may cause poor digestion, so undigested food will pass into the intestines, putrefy and give off foul gas which rises up and causes bad breath. This problem is quite common with older people whose body does not produce enough hydrochloric acid naturally to aid the digestion process.



Another common digestive problem is due to the imbalance of good and bad bacteria in the gut. Food won't be digested properly and the result can be acid reflux, yeast overgrowth, or fermentation. One of the byproducts of this problem is bad breath. To correct this imbalance, use a probiotic.



• Diarrhea caused by intestinal parasites is the third leading cause of illness. If you have a number of the following symptoms: gas, diarrhea, chronic constipation, bloating, fatigue, skin rashes, nail biting, mood swings, insomnia, dry skin, brittle hair, hair loss, weight gain, bad breath, and muscle cramping, you should be tested for parasites. 



• Dental problems, especially periodontal disease and tooth abscesses, are often the cause of bad breath. These infected areas harbor large quantities of bacteria from the infection and foods eaten which have been allowed to putrefy. Other dental sources are gaps between teeth or crooked teeth, both areas where food can be left to decay. Vitamin deficiencies, especially vitamin C and niacin, are the cause of some gum diseases, so follow the supplementation recommendations listed below. Don't chew gum or eat candy, as the sugar can leave a residue that promotes rapid bacterial growth. Each person's body chemistry is different, so what works for somebody may have no effect on somebody else, all due to that person's chemistry. See our gingivitis/periodontal section for more information on dental problems.

Changes to Make

Ridding yourself of bad breath may be a several step process. By following a step-by-step program you may find the cause of bad breath and be able to eliminate the problem. Try this program over several weeks and see what works for you.



Oral Hygiene

Practicing good oral hygiene is always important, so start here. There are three areas of concern in the mouth: the tongue, teeth, and gums. Brushing your teeth, flossing, and cleaning your gums, followed by rinsing thoroughly, will help minimize the problem by removing the buildup of bacteria. The tongue may be loaded with decaying food particles and bacteria that cause bad breath. Brushing or scraping your tongue first thing in the morning and before bed will help eliminate the problem here. By removing the buildup of decayed material, a major breeding ground for bacteria, you will reduce your plaque as well. The plaque leads to periodontal disease, which, in turn, can lead to heart disease. So this oral hygiene step is very important to your overall health!



• Get your teeth cleaned and any cavities filled. Plaque and cavities are a great breeding ground for the bacteria that cause bad breath.



• Another way to improve your oral hygiene is to use a water pik after breakfast. Put an ounce of hydrogen peroxide in the water.



• Try brushing your gums and tongue with some powdered cloves or myrrh.



• Brush your tongue twice a day with a toothbrush soaked in chlorhexidine (an antibacterial agent).



• Swish water around in your mouth after each meal or snack. This will reduce the food particles or drink residue (primarily sugar) that may lead to your bad breath.



 Although mouthwashes will solve some of the immediate problems, you must get at the root of the cause. Mouthwashes in general are only a temporary mask for the problem, and their effects last only half an hour or so. Gargle with an antiseptic mouthwash. Try to find a mouthwash that has as little alcohol as possible, as the alcohol will make the problem worse! Also, frequent use of a mouthwash with more than 25% alcohol has been linked to an increased incidence of oral cancer. For a non-alcoholic mouthwash, use a mixture of 50% hydrogen peroxide (3% solution) and 50% water, and swish it around for 30 seconds and expectorate.



Your saliva is important in the fight against bad breath as it suppresses bacteria that cause it. Anything that reduces the saliva output, such as alcohol, antianxiety drugs, smoking, stress, and medications such as decongestants and diuretics, allows the microorganisms to proliferate.



Dietary

Eliminating certain types of foods, such as high-fat foods, meat, sugar, exotic spices, and dairy products is the next step in pin-pointing the cause of bad breath. The types of food you eat may be one of the reasons for your bad breath. Acidic foods, for instance, create an environment for bacterial growth. High-fat and high-protein foods may not digest well and give off gas. Some people have a hard time metabolizing meat and dairy products, with the result being bad breath.



Sugary foods are a problem as the bacteria in the back of the throat feed off the sugar.



Garlic, onions and exotic spices (such as curry) are common sources of problems for many people. As these foods are digested certain compounds are transmitted from the blood through the lungs and exhaled for up to 24 hours.



Cheeses, such as blue, Camembert and Roquefort, fish, especially canned tuna and anchovies, and spicy deli meats are often the culprits.



Beverages such as coffee and tea are other possible sources of bad breath. They are both very acidic. Cut back on these and see what happens.



Eat more fruits, especially kiwi, papaya and pineapple, which contain digestive enzymes. Vegetables are very important, too, especially leafy green ones.





Supplements

Vitamin B A deficiency of B vitamins may be the cause of your bad breath, so try taking 50 mg of niacinimide with each meal, plus a high potency B complex tablet and 50 mg of B6 once a day.



Vitamin C in divided daily doses of 1,000 to 6,000 mg will help rid the body of excess mucus and toxins that may be the cause of bad breath.



Zinc A deficiency in zinc may be another cause; take 30 to 60 mg per day. Don't take more than 15 mg. of zinc for more than a week or ten days without medical supervision as high levels of zinc can interfere with the absorption of copper.



Digestive system

Another step to take is to improve your whole digestive system. By changing your digestion you may well eliminate the cause of your bad breath. A high-fiber diet emphasizing whole grains and fruits and vegetables is essential for optimum digestion. Stay away from high-fat foods. Eating yogurt or acidophilus will help balance your stomach by adding beneficial bacteria which will improve digestion.



There may be three causes of improper functioning of your digestive system.



• First, your system may be lacking in enzymes necessary for proper digestion. This is especially prevalent in older people. To remedy this problem take 2-4 tablets of digestive enzymes with each meal.



• An imbalance of good and bad bacteria in your gut, as mentioned above. Take a probiotic supplement that contains good bacteria like acidophilus and bifidus.



• A second problem may be the lack of enough hydrochloric acid, the production of which declines with age. To remedy this, take a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before each meal. Another way to get the necessary hydrochloric acid is to take 10 grains of betaine or pepsin tablets before each meal to aid digestion.



Detoxification of your bowels is another important step to take as many health problems are caused by poor bowel functions. For instance, constipation may be the cause of your bad breath. Putrefied food may be stuck in your intestines and give off noxious gas. Many people who are constipated don't drink enough water. For optimum health, drink eight 8 ounce glasses of water a day.



Another important thing to do is eat plenty of fiber. Eating several servings of yogurt with live cultures will help regain a balanced intestinal flora and get the bowel to function the way it should. This will help the constipation problem and get your intestines working properly. Or, you may not realize specifically that you have a bowel problem, so it is important to cleanse the bowel to eliminate this as a possible source. If you have a tendency to over eat your stomach's digestive enzymes may not be able to complete the digestion process and gas may be emanating from the intestines.



In some cases a deficiency of vitamin B6 is the cause. Since B6 is not plentiful in foods, this deficiency occurs frequently.

Remedies

Folk

Apple cider vinegar Take a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar just before each meal. You may want to take it in a glass of water. This will aid your digestion.



Baking soda Brushing your teeth with baking soda (or a paste made with hydrogen peroxide) will help reduce the acidity in your mouth and make a less-friendly environment for the bacteria to grow.



Charcoal Take 5 gm. daily of activated charcoal to cleanse the stomach and intestines. Charcoal absorbs toxins and is a natural purifier.



Hydrogen peroxide The sinuses can become infected and cause bad breath. If this is your problem, the best treatment is using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Use the drugstore variety, which is three percent, dilute it 50% with water and put five to ten drops in each nostril and sniff vigorously. It may burn a little. Do this twice daily and see if it helps. If it doesn't, your sinuses are not the problem.



Water, salt Gargling with salt water will help clean out bacteria, mucus and food particles on your tonsils or the back of your throat that may be causing your bad breath.



Herbal

Alfalfa tablets may help eliminate bad breath.



Anise Chew anise, cardamom, dill or fennel seeds to help mask odors. Anise, the licorice-flavored seed, kills the bacteria that cause odor.



Chlorophyll Try liquid or chlorophyll tablets which you can buy at your pharmacy. Chlorophyll has a deodorizing effect and is used in a number of products for that purpose.



Cloves Cloves are a powerful antiseptic. Make a tea by putting 3 whole or 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves in 2 cups of hot water, and steep for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour through a fine strainer and use as a mouthwash or gargle twice a day.



Fennel Fennel is another useful herb and can be used in several ways. Slowly chew the leaves and allow the saliva to build up in your mouth. Or, mix the contents of a fennel capsule with baking soda, make into a paste, and brush your teeth, gums and tongue with it. The fluid extract of fennel can be rubbed on your gums and tongue.



Filberts Chew some filberts (hazelnuts) slowly as they will absorb the bad breath.



Herbs Chewing mint, parsley, basil, rosemary, thyme and wintergreen will help mitigate bad breath.



Lemon Suck a lemon wedge sprinkled with salt to stop onion or garlic breath.



Myrrh Dissolving a pea-sized piece of myrrh in your mouth before bed or sucking a small piece of cinnamon bark during the day may help relieve the problem.



• It can be made into a tea. To make the tea add 2 sprigs of coarsely chopped parsley, 3 whole spice cloves, 1 teaspoon of powdered myrrh, and 1/4 teaspoon powdered goldenseal to 1 pint of boiling water. Steep. Stir occasionally while cooling, then strain and use as a mouthwash.



Parsley & mint Chewing parsley or mint leaves has been a remedy used for thousands of years. These herbs are especially good if garlic and onions are the source of your bad breath. Parsley is very high in chlorophyll. Chew a few parsley sprigs dipped in vinegar for immediate relief. If you swallow the leaves after chewing them they will be digested and continue to provide breath freshness for quite a while. These plants seem to reduce the production of intestinal gas by promoting better digestion.



• Natural gum made with spearmint or peppermint essential oils will also be helpful. These oils kill odor- causing bacteria, and the chewing action stimulates the production of saliva which helps combat bad breath.



Sage Chew sage. It contains essential oils with antibacterial properties that help neutralize one of the causes of bad breath.



Spirulina is a very good source of chlorophyll and can be purchased either in capsule or loose form. Start with 500 mg three times a day.



Tea Another tea may be made by steeping 2 sprigs of coarsely chopped parsley, 3 whole cloves, 1 teaspoon of powdered myrrh and 1/4 teaspoon powdered goldenseal in 1 pint of boiling water. Stir occasionally while cooling, strain, and use as a mouthwash. Can also be used for a sore throat. Alfalfa is rich in chlorophyll. Drink alfalfa tea several times a day to keep your breath fresh. To make the tea, put two teaspoons of dried leaves in a cup of boiling water and steep for 10-20 minutes. You may also find alfalfa tablets at an herb or health food store.



• Peppermint or fenugreek are other good herbs to use in a tea to sooth the stomach. They are exhaled through the lungs and help sweeten the breath.



Tea tree oil Tea tree oil, derived from the leaves of the native Australian Melaleuca alternifolia tree, contain antiseptic compounds that make it a powerful disinfectant. Try using a toothpaste containing tea tree oil, or put a few drops of tea tree oil on your toothbrush alone, or with your regular toothpaste. It has a strong aromatic flavor.""",4,1732444963.0,badbreath,3,0.84,False

I’m not sure if this was the right thing to do, I blocked my ex on basically every platform today after getting coffee with him. 

We had a very friendly breakup, he was struggling with his mental health and self identity, he ended things with me then decided on a break. I gave him two months of no contact and space to figure things out, then back in august he dumped me again - but told me he needed time to work on himself ‘for me’. 

I was devastated, but also hopeful. I spent the past three months throwing myself into work, spending time with friends and just trying to get through day by day. But I never really let go of the idea that my ex was ‘my person’ and that we’d find our way back to each other. 

Two weeks ago I saw him at a mutual friends party, and he basically followed me around all night. He brought up very intimate things about our past, and told me the only person he wanted to be with is me. 

I met him for coffee today and we had an hour of really nice catching up. Then we talked about some more difficult things, he told me that he’d slept with someone else, and how she had cooked him dinner and he’d gone over to her place. He also said she was pretty , but that he felt horrible after and called things off with her. 

I was obviously devastated, and I started tearing up at the cafe so I we got up and started walking towards my car. I told him that I’d felt he’d been giving me hope with his weird comments, and that I had been keeping the door open for him in the future 

He apologised about how indecisive he is, and said he thinks he shouldn’t be with anyone until he gets back from a trip he’s going on next year. 

I also said I didn’t think we should be getting back together right now, but that I also don’t think I’m able to be his friend. 

I ended by saying that I still care about him but I just can’t do it anymore.

He hugged me and was squeezing me so tight it was like he didn’t want to let go, I then went to my car and bawled my eyes out, and blocked him on everything. 

I’m not sure if it was the right thing to do, but it’s obvious that he’s chosen himself, and I need to choose myself too.

I’m honestly fucking terrified about the future and everything seems so bleak and sad right now, not sure what to do with myself anymore :( ",1,1732444422.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Pretty much what you'd expect in a rural call centre like ours, where it's been fifteen women plus one poor Brian the past two years, who's the only bloke left since Darryl, Shelly's ex, passed away. 

Good thing Brian's in a wheelchair these days, is all I'll say. 

Ashton was his name. He didn't smile or say much, just followed Monica around with a kind of Lurch vibe before sitting at his pod, where he didn't move the rest of the day. 

Our pods back then were six to a large desk split by these flimsy partitions, and Ashton's PC was on the other side behind me, two pods down. So that's if I turned around it's Katie, and Ashton was over the other side at the wall, next to Shelly. 

Good old Shelly. Oh and the other office lady's name from before was Tina, just remembered.

So it wasn't much out of the ordinary. Unassuming as he was physically imposing, basically. When Shelly brought her Anzac biscuits in special because it was his birthday, I'd say that's when he came out of his shell finally. Weird thing seeing him get animated, all of a sudden.

He didn't eat any though, just wrapped several in tissue paper for his Nan. We even exchanged a few words on break the next day, me and him. He was waiting for the water to boil and we laughed about how shit the instant coffee was. Fucking International Roast. I remember thinking, you know what, he's actually not that creepy when he laughs. 

After the ice was broken he asked about Shelly more than anything else. Figured he didn't realise how obvious he was making out that he fancied her back, and I didn't mind helping. about five years ago Shelly's ex hubby ago ran off with a younger lass, so good for her. Best I could do was play wingman for her and s younger bloke without making a big deal out of it.

Some of his questions, though. Wish I'd written them down. They weren't all normal, put it that way. This one in particular, wanted to know all about what colours Shelly wore the most. Like, how often she wore a green dress. How often she wore this weirdly shaped green necklace. How often she baked for the office and what was she wearing on the days she brought homemade goodies in, like those Anzac biscuits. He snuck them questions in so naturally that I didn't notice till later, how strange they were.

I can remember the colour one because it turns out he was colourblind. He did like Shelly, he told me, and because he could only see certain shades of brown and grey, he preferred getting to know people first of all through the colours they wore. Especially people he liked. This is what he says to me. When something is harder to focus on, you can learn it on a deeper level, he explained. Guess he must've learned a lot more the harder way in life.

Way over my lazy head, plus sounded like some bullshit. But this about brings us up to speed. Shelly didn't show this morning, and it's been over a week since anyone's heard from Ashton. He just stopped coming in. His Pop passed away not long after his second birthday here, about two months ago that was, and he wasn't the same after that. And then he kept getting worse.

Last I saw him he was gaunt, hunched over, even more than usual, and barely acknowledged me. Looked like a cold death barely warmed-up. Our regular TL Donna confided one day that she didn't know what to do with him. His performance had dropped so much that he was failing every KPI metric, even though he'd had the best first year out of any of us, apparently.

And then, Shelly. I figured the two of them finally met outside of work, because she was buzzing all of a sudden. 

She also, rather curiously, started wearing a lot more green. Not sure I'd have noticed if it wasn't for Ashton and his weird questions the previous year, but there it was. Every day it was some new green item, like new skirts or socks or a pendant she had on. And she started packing on the kilos, too, which could only mean she was baking extra. Which all us girls knew she only ever did when she was shagging.

Still you'd never see that vibe from Ashton. He was taciturn at the best of times, and between the weight-loss and obvious grief he made a sore contrast to the woman apparently now his lover. You know for an office small as ours it was a wonder no-one knew for sure. But Shelly wouldn't budge when asked. Just smiled and changed the subject. And there was no getting blood out of Lurch-boy Ashton. So the rest of us sleuthed what we could, gossiped on smokebreaks, and moved on. Never a doubt in my mind, though.
They were definitely fucking.

And I think to confirm that fact, as a kind of wink to me and Katie, two of us being the only others he ever spoke to besides Shelly, Ashton brought in his own batch of Anzacs last week. Bloody delicious, they were. Dare I say even better than Shelly's. But it was really the green shoes and rings that made it obvious, what he was communicating. Maybe the driest sense of humour I've encountered. Certainly the weirdest.

Was an old recipe of his Nan's passed down the family, Ashton told me. That's why they looked so odd, his Anzacs did, and why they tasted so good. 

Good thing he brought a tub full too because otherwise Shelly might've eaten them all on her own. It's like she couldn't stop from the moment he undid the lid. Katie and I lost count, but she must've eaten at least twenty of the things.

The next day, Ashton was just gone. Donna tried calling a few times, but there's bugger all reception where he lives. We just hope he's alright. Not much more we can do, really. Shelly wasn't too interested in helping, either. Still playing coy about their relationship the whole time and made out she didn't know anything more than we did. Even though her vibe said otherwise. And over the past week she must've packed another five kilos on, and there's been this darkness on her face getting worse. Much worse in fact. Looked half crazed yesterday, like she hadn't slept in a month. Donna couldn't get in touch with her either this morning.

These office romances. Real wildcards, ain't they? Take Shelly's last office fling, Brian, for example. His allergies meant he could never eat her Anzacs, and so he'd just pretend to eat them while palming the crumbs to his pockets. When she found out what he was doing, she grabbed an old rifle, loaded it, apparently shot him square the right kneecap. It was her who reported the accident. Brian was just too nice to press charges. That's the story, anyway, and we only know that much because of what Brian's ex wife told Pamela, who told Katie, who told Barbara, who somehow told me before Pamela even knew.

Actually, there's Brian now, on his new wheelchair—the one handed down from Ashton's Nan, who died from that nasty gastro last year. Looks good on him, if that was a thing. 

Poor bloody Ashton though. Hope he's alright. Thinking I'll wear green tomorrow, in case it makes any difference.

Choccy is dead, and his slime coat was being eaten by one of my plecos. He is dead. I know no one cares but I rescue fish and I really bonded with this guy. I'm legit heartbroken and I feel guilty. I can't stop crying.


The worst part was seeing the female angelfish stare at his body while the pleco had the best meal of it's life. I know she somehow knew what was going on.
