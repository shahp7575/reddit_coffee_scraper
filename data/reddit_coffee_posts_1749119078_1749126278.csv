I have followed some great tips on this sub (thanks) and can report that just by using a hot plate and turning the stove off when the pot starts to bubble has made my coffee taste so much better.

However, I am struggling to get anything close to 3 cups each time. It has thus far been more like 2 cups and the upper chamber only seems about 2/3s full, with the bottom chamber still holding a bit of water. If I let it keep going on the stove the pot starts sputtering and the end result tastes way too overcooked. 

So I’m just wondering if this is just how it is, i.e. I can get a maximum of 3 cups each time but really only 2 cups if staying within the threshold of tasting good? Or are those of you with more skill consistently getting 3 perfect tasting cups?",1,1749125826.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

1l3xjey,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3bgJMunfk,How two strangers made an award-winning short film,"I wanted to share the story of how I went from a low point in my filmmaking career to making an award-winning film with a complete stranger for a budget of under $5,000.

A few years ago, I was stuck in a creative rut—unable to finish a script and questioning if I was meant to be a filmmaker. Eventually, I let go of the idea that I *had* to direct something I wrote, and instead posted a callout for scripts on Shooting People. 

Out of many submissions, one stood out: a dystopian sci-fi short by Heather McQuaid.

We met for coffee, clicked immediately, and without thinking about it twice took the plunge: I was going to make this film with a person I’d only just met. We funded it 50/50 and began months of development. We had our fair share of setbacks and learned so much in the process, but eventually we successfully shot the film with an amazing cast and crew. 

When all was said and done, we had a film we could be really proud of! It was titled **A Positive Contribution**

What started as a stranger sending me their script ended with my biggest project to date and a film which has screened at dozens of festivals around the world and won various awards and nominations. When I first met Heather, I really couldn’t have imagined the journey we would go on, but it was such a great collaboration and we’ve since worked on various other projects together, including a TV series based on A Positive Contribution.

More importantly, meeting Heather and making this film got me out of this defeatist cycle and really gave me the kick up the ass I needed to start creating again and rediscover my love for filmmaking. 

If anybody else has had the same experience, I hope this can be your inspiration to just go out and make something! No more excuses!

If you’d like to see what we made, you can see A Positive Contribution here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3bgJMunfk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3bgJMunfk)

I’d love to know what you think (honest feedback!) and would gladly share what we learned if anybody has questions about our experience or process!

Episode 6: Nonnon Who Comes Back

Note: Nonnon = Snorkmaiden.

Snork drove a car with Snorkmaiden sitting by his side. While they were discussing about returning to Moominvalley, their car's tire was punctured. Snork complained about Moominvalley roads was rough and rundown. While changing the tire, Moomin and Little My snooped in. Snork insulted them for being uncouth that they probably had never seen a car before. As Snork and Little My were arguing to each other, Moomin was pushed; he fell into a ditch and found Snorkmaiden in a flower field. The two took a liking to each other. He gave her flowers before Snork called her back to the car to leave. Later on, Moomin wrote a love poem and song for her but Snork immediately disapproved of their feelings and relationship due to Moomin's social standing. Moomin determined to buy her a jewel pendant to show his dedication and love toward her. He became a street musician and a shoeshiner with Little My's help. Both times, he got into troubles with some townsfolks resulting in him being disciplined by Moominpappa by the order of the Inspector. Successfully earning some money, Moomin bought the pendant. On the social gathering night, Moomin and Snorkmaiden met up and had a dance together. However, Little My switched the pendant with a frog in a jewel case as a small prank causing Snorkmaiden to be scared and Snork punched Moomin. Little My confessed and cleared things up for them. Looking at the pendant Moomin bought with his hard-earned money, Snork said that it was only cheap jewel pendant before throwing on the floor. Moomin was furious and punched Snork. The two then began to fight each other.

ENDING: Moomin and Snork had a fistfight through the town, the meadow and the hill until they ended up falling into the lake where Snufkin was camping nearby. Snorkmaiden ran in and begged Snufkin to stop them but it was nothing he could do until the two would come into term with each other. Crawling out of the lake, the two admitted to another that they were tough enough to withstand this long. They then saw Snorkmaiden cried so they eventually stopped the pointless fight. Snufkin then came in to carry injured Snork home. Before leaving, Stork told Moomin to take Snorkmaiden home later. Moomin and Snorkmaiden then spent the night with each other on the bathing house dock by the sea under the moonlight.

Episode 7: Good-bye, Gao-Gao 

Mr. Hemulen had officially opened a communal park in Moominvalley as everyone congratulated him. Moomin, Snorkmaiden, Little My and Sniff went separate ways to find him congratulations gifts. Moomin decided to look for some butterflies up on the meadow. Suddenly a gust of wind blew through and destroyed part of the field. In the debris, Moomin found and rescued a small purple creature stuck under a branch. He helped Moomin caught many butterflies and insisted on following Moomin. Moomin gave in and named him Gao-Gao. Going to Mr. Hemulen's house, Moomin forgot that he put Gao-Gao in the bug container and he startled Mr. Hemulen. After, he bought Gao-Gao home to his parents and they reluctantly agreed that Moomin could keep him as a pet. The next day, Gao-Gao pranked and caused a lots of troubles to everyone in Moominvalley. Mr. Hemulen researched and later found out that Gao-Gao was a baby dragon. He subsequently told the Inspector and Moominpappa. Moomin spent time with Gao-Gao and Snufkin in a relatively peaceful afternoon. But at night, Gao-Gao cried out while looking upon the night sky longingly, much to Moomin's distress. Moominpappa talked to Moomin that he must give up Gao-Gao for Moominvalley was not a dragon's home.

ENDING: The next day, the Inspector and Mr. Hemulen took Gao-Gao away in a cage. After a short ride, Gao-Gao broke out of the cage and escaped up the hill. Moomin ran after Gao-Gao to see Snufkin behind a bush. Snufkin told Moomin to stay put while Gao-Gao was continuously jumping toward a gust of wind. Moominpappa later came after Moomin as they all witnessed Gao-Gao flew up into the wind and returned to the sky. Moomin cheered and said goodbye with tear running down his eyes.

Episode 8: Nonnon is in Danger

Little My found a letter falling off the mailman's bag, she brought it to Snork. Coincidentally, the letter was actually for Snork sent by the Noble from Paris that he would soon visit Snork family in Moominvalley. Little My interpreted to Moomin that the Noble would come to take away Snorkmaiden. Moomin instantly became very defensive for Snorkmaiden much to her concern. The Noble arrived and Little My led him to Snork's house. She often blushed talking to him but also spied him for Moomin. As the Noble spent time with Snork and Snorkmaiden, Moomin got jealous and was heartbroken. Moomin decided to train himself to fight and dance like a Noble with Snufkin's help. As soon as he was ready, he challenged the Noble up on the windy hill. Snork, Snorkmaiden, Moominpappa and Moominmamma later found out about the challenge letter so they drove the car and rushed up hill to stop them. Up on the hill, Moomin pointed a sword right at the cowering Noble, Snufkin interfered and gave the two flintlocks to duel in a gun standoff instead.

ENDING: As everyone arrived to see Moomin and the Noble about to shoot each other, Moomin fired a shot at the Noble, defeating him. However, the flintlocks Snufkin gave them were just prop pistols. Everyone laughed but Moomin felt humiliated and frustrated. He chased the Noble with a sword causing him to fall off a cliff. Snorkmaiden came to stop Moomin but he pushed Snorkmaiden away and ran off to Hattifattener Island. Later, Snufkin took Snorkmaiden onto a boat and followed Moomin out into the sea. Sitting among the Hattifatteners, Moomin made up with Snorkmaiden and returned to Moominvalley. Moomin later apologized to the Noble as now they learned that he did not come to take Snorkmaiden away like what Little My told. Snufkin chastised her for causing all the troubles as Little My apologized. The Noble then bade them farewell and left Moominvalley.

Episode 9: Train Great Robber of Moomin Valley

Snork drove Moomin and Snorkmaiden further from Moominvalley to show them a train passing through. Snork then held a town meeting planning to build a railway system in Moominvalley and put it on a map. Snork asked excited Moominpappa to help with a speech letter and printouts. That night, Moominpappa could not come out with an idea so he went on a stroll. Along the way, he came across Snufkin and had a chat with him. Snufkin told Moominpappa about both positive and negative impacts that the railway system would bring upon Moominvalley. Moominpappa quickly changed his mind about the railway system entirely. The next day, he tried to convince Snork but it was too late to stop the construction that was already under way. Moominpappa then disguised himself as a bandit and went around town putting up wanted posters of his bandit character to scare everyone off. The next night, Moomin, Snorkmaiden, Little My and Sniff armed with water guns and improvised weapons went out and hunted the ""bandit"". Moomin got a shot on the ""bandit"" but he ran off. Moomin and Moominmamma later learned the true identity of the ""bandit"" so Moominmamma put a sleeping pill in Moominpappa's coffee on the opening day. They failed and Moominpappa got out of the house while waiting for the train behind the rocks. He later found the Inspector and Mr. Hemulen who disguised as bandits as they also opposed the railway system project as well.

ENDING: As the train from out-of-town approaching with Snork onboard, the real horse-riding bandits showed up and derailed the train with a dynamite. They quickly rounded up people with their pistols drawn. Waiting on the far hill, Snufkin sniped the pistols off their hands and they were quickly apprehended by Moominpappa, the Inspector and Mr. Hemulen. While the railway system was destroyed, the village was saved nonetheless. Snufkin watched them through a telescope with a smile.

Episode 10: Mysterious Midget

Thingumy and Bob came across Moominhouse while everyone was out. The two made themselves at home and took an interest on silver spoons. In the park, the Inspector announced to everyone that there would be a costume parade festival that everyone could participate in the upcoming day. Moomin family later returned home to find their home invaded and found Thingumy and Bob inside. Thingumy and Bob treated them like they were the house guests. The family tried to politely get them to leave on their own. Moominmamma convinced them to leave but they later came back to Moominhouse at night however. The next day, everyone went and participated in the costume parade. Meanwhile, the Muskrat argued with Mr. Hemulen and left him alone in the forest. Mr. Hemulen felt asleep on a hay cart as Thingumy and Bob came across him and wanted his shoes. They tied him up on the cart to remove the tight shoes. However, Mr. Hemulen woke up and panicked, the cart rolled down the forest path toward the parade resulting in him winning the competition for the dramatic entrance. After, everyone realized that all of their silver spoons were stolen from their houses. They found out that Thingumy and Bob were the two who stole them, Snork put them up in a court.

ENDING: As everyone testified for them, Mr. Hemulen stepped up and would gladly take them into his care. After, Thingumy and Bob moved in and lived with Mr. Hemulen.

Translator Note

\- Nonnon is Snorkmaiden in v1969 and v1972. I think she is also known as ""Floren"" in v1990 JP version.

\- Snork as a character is interesting as in this version, he is pompous, snobbish, serious and authoritative. In v1972, he is almost the same but in a much goofier and way less serious tone. I do prefer v1990 where he is a calm but worrywart inventor.

\- Episode 7 is a mirrored episode of the v1990 E13: The Last Dragon on Earth. I slightly preferred this version for it's quite sad at the end. I implore you to watch this episode yourself.

\- Episode 9 is my guilty pleasure. I always crack up seeing almost everyone holding a gun. Especially, Little My holding a Tommy Gun version of a water gun. The good news is that this is certainly not the last time she is seen holding a gun, ""v2019"".

\- Episode 10, I am unsure of what many people said in the court as the loud sounds from people made Google Translate freaked out and could not pick anything up very well.

\- Source Episode 6-10:: [https://www.youtube.com/@snusmumur1ku](https://www.youtube.com/@snusmumur1ku)

\- Thank you for reading and enjoy.

One of them was getting married the following week.

Here’s what he said:



“Look…

It's not the job that wrecks your marriage.



It’s everything you don’t deal with because of the job.



We're trained to shut it off and keep moving.

That’s how you survive the job.

But you bring that home? You’ll burn the whole place down.



In our line of work 60-70% of us get divorced - I know I've been there twice.



At work, you’re the calm in the chaos.

At home, you forget to take out the trash.

Then you wonder why nothing feels right.



You show up for strangers at 3 AM.

But your family? They get leftovers.



That doesn’t make you a bad guy.

Just means you need to figure it out before it’s too late.



Because the guys that don’t?

They end up alone, wondering what happened.”



Hard truth, yeah.

But here’s what I took from it:



Take 10 minutes before you walk in the house. Reset.



Swap your FD hat for your dad/husband hat — literally.



Pick one night a week to connect. No phones. Just talk.



Say thank you. Mean it.



Get a life outside the job. Something that grounds you.



Mel didn’t preach. He didn’t even look up from his coffee.

But the room was dead silent.

Banks aren’t dumb, they’re watching patterns, especially now. If you wanna survive in this game, play it like a ghost.

Here’s your street-smart survival guide:


---

1. Never Use Your Main Bank Account

That’s your salary bank? UPI for food delivery? Don’t even think about it. Open a fresh account just for P2P — something small, rural, or lesser known. If it gets flagged, no panic. You move on.


---

2. Use Cardless Cash Withdrawal (CCW)

CCW is low-key and clean — no need for your card, just OTP-based withdrawal at ATMs. Safe and convenient for under ₹1 lakh per day. Especially useful when you’re picking up or moving cash discreetly.


---

3. Avoid Frequent High-Volume Transfers

Don’t stack ₹50K-₹1L every 10 minutes like you’re flipping burgers. That’s exactly what flags systems. Rotate accounts. Space out trades. Stay under the radar.


---

4. Gift Cards > Banks (When Possible)

Amazon, Flipkart, Nykaa — whatever works. If the other guy accepts it, do the deal in vouchers. Zero banking involvement. Zero trails.


---

5. Face-to-Face for Big Volume

Big trades? Go F2F. Coffee, handshake, and crypto. Instant, safe, and no one’s watching over your shoulder.


---

6. Small Amounts? UPI Works

If you’re doing tiny trades — ₹1K to ₹5K — UPI is fine. Keep it casual, use clean labels, and don’t repeat patterns. The real trouble starts when you scale.


---

7. Separate Bank Accounts for Buy & Sell

Don’t repeat the same account for both ends. Buy from one, cash out from another. Break patterns. Look like five people, not one.


---

8. Don't Let Funds Sit

Made the flip? Move the profit. Don’t park ₹2L in your P2P account. If it gets frozen, you lose it. Stay dry. Stay light.

---

10. Use Only Trusted Escrow — We Got You

Never trust random middlemen. Our community runs a 24/7 Escrow Bot inside Telegram with verified sellers, buyers, and full transparency.

We are going from a dark brown leather L sectional to a fabric three seater Metro from Room and Board and a sand Stressless chair with ottoman. It’s just me, my husband, and an older dog, and we are homebody’s during the week. We occasionally have people and family over, including kids. 

The couch will be delivered today, and I’m nervous I won’t like the fabric durability. Our sectional we have currently has held up great for 13 years from Klaussner. I just got tired of the sectional layout and we wanted a recliner. 

If we keep the Metro, would another ottoman work with a wood tray for a coffee table? Or should we opt for a coffee table? We also liked the idea of a couch with chaise next to the back door, but I’m sure I will get annoyed with the inability to move the chaise portion. (Correction on room layout: back door left side is fixed and doesn’t operate like a door. Not perfectly to scale.)

If we decide no on the Metro, I’m thinking of a leather couch in a camel color that would go well with the chair. But the same question- ottoman with tray or coffee table? 

We also have a blue wing chair from Article that will go in the corner near the tv console table.

1l3x7aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1l3x7aw/im_a_neet26m_and_need_help/,I'm a NEET(26M) and need help.,"To preface this, here's some details of my character; I'm unemployed without a driver's license at 26 and have been freeloading off of my parents. My dream was to become an animator, but I've made no progress towards it. I've always had an issue with maintaining motivation, so I put off things that are both important, optional, and/or of interest. I can hardly enjoy entertainment, but I enjoy watching others have fun. As my username implies, I'm a deadbeat. Despite that, I've tried to at least maintain some level of discipline that kept me civil and crime-free. I hate narcotics, nicotine and only drink alcohol probably twice a year as part of a celebration. I don't mind hard work as long as I understand the assignment, for instance, when I had a task to complete, I'll set to it getting done one way or another, and whenever my parents needed something done, I did it without hesitation or complaint (in this aspect, I reasoned my issue being me having problems turning the car on, but not having further issues when the engine is running). Lastly, I revere my parents.

Years ago when I graduated from high school, my plan was to attend the Art Institute of Washington, but due to the experiences of an acquaintance, reviews, and an interview that didn't sit well with them, nor me since I couldn't understand what was being said, I ended up not attending.

In 2017, shortly after graduating, through my brother, I got a job at a restaurant as a server for meager pay + tips. This job lasted until the end of COVID. My family had been pushing me to attend college and get a driver's license. While my parents have advocated me to pursue college, that experience with Art Institute stuck with me, and I opted to learn from scowling through the internet, but I had not then, and have not made any progress in that regard now, and I used excuses to not get a driver's license because of my fear of the road. Everyone I know has been in a car accident by being crashed into, with my brother getting caught whilst in an Uber, and one of my uncle's died on the road, and my father's health rapidly began to decline ever since he had his crash, so the seeming inevitability of road rage had incentivized me from getting that license.

As a server, I was complacent with meager pay, because while I wasn't making much, objectively, I was able to contribute to the household. Especially after my father's car accident forced him to retire earlier than he planned. Then, COVID hit, and a loss of customers meant a loss of revenue as a server and that, among other reasons, ended up with me leaving that job at the end of 2020, and to this day, I've yet to secure employment. At the time, I applied for SNAP, but without income, that benefit was lost some time in 2024.

During my job hunt, I used Indeed to apply. Because I didn't have any marketable skills and no driver's license, I applied for entry-level jobs within the same county. Somewhere I can access and meet attendance promptly. But, no interviews. With the lack of interviews, mixed with seemingly obscure job postings, I picked up on a habit of ""waiting"". I ended up waiting for so long, 2024 came, and I have no recollection of the events that took place during that time frame. I just know I did nothing. Fortunately, I managed to get some one-day gigs from a friend of my brother's, so I managed to keep my phone paid, but those opportunities eventually stilled.

In 2024, my father was admitted to a hospital for surgery on his foot, and he was diagnosed with Type-2 diabetes. At this point, he is now 60 years. During his recovery, he was visited by nurses, but because he couldn't put strain on his feet and after a year, his legs lost the strength to support his body weight. He got by through the wheelchair and by crawling when stairs are an obstacle. Since the bathroom was on the same floor, he could wheel himself there when we weren't present.

Despite being a deadbeat, I still wanted to support my parents, so I resumed my job search in 2023, and until the day of this posting, I only got two interviews;

One was for an Amazon warehouse, that cancelled my training days on the same day I was interviewed due to being full. Because I was approved in the system, I was suggested to wait for an opening and apply, but after a few months of checking the website daily, weekly, nothing. 

The second was for a fast food place. I managed to get two interviews. The first one went smooth, but on the second one, I could tell I fumbled. First, I was asked if I had experience working as part of a team. When I said yes, I was asked to explain what I did. Maybe it's because I was thinking too hard, been out of the job in question for so long, did that job long enough to make it a subconscious effort, my ability to think critically was compromised over the years of inactivity, or an odd mix of all of the above, but I couldn't answer that question coherently. I sounded like a broken record, repeating the previous points. I can't remember if the interview continued or ended there, but I knew I screwed it up.

In late March 2025, my father had what seemed to be a seizure and had to be readmitted to the hospital. He was released in the beginning of April. All seemed usual up to before his seizure. But, after a week, he had another seizure. From his first seizures to that one, all happened when he was exerting himself. I don't know if it was due to his blood pressure or glucose level. What was strange was that when he was unresponsive, he seemed to collect himself the instant I brought up 911 to get help. He didn't respond to us, but he responded to that every time to keep them from coming. The first time, I called anyway, but this time I buckled because he was conscious enough to explain what happened, unlike the first time. That's the excuse I had at the time, but thinking of it, it was most likely my reverence towards my parents that prevented me from opposing his decision. Fortunately, that was the last time he had a seizure to date. Unfortunately, it wouldn't be the last time his blood pressure and his glucose levels would be alarmingly high.

This was due to one, him not receiving all of his prescriptions supposedly, as he always has to call in for missing medications weekly, and him not having a healthy diet, and unfortunately, I can't say me or my mother is helping. Though she cut back on feeding him the same salt/sugar rich meals, she buys him the same salt-filled junk foods like chips. I can't cook more than instant ramen, hot dogs, sandwiches, and rice, so I can't replace her, and when pops gets tired of ""bland"" or repetitive meals, he orders fast food. My only silver-lining is that he primarily drinks straight water, minus coffee (not decaf) with splenda.

He is always within earshot from my room, so I can hear him noise, so I'm vigilant whenever I hear anything strange, since mom sleeps where she can't watch over him.

All that to say, between my pop's health, and his seemingly blase attitude towards helping himself, the miscommunication or disregard by his doctor/pharmacy, me and my mother's inability to properly ""help"" him, I've been paranoid about the near future. Especially since I looked up the average lifespan of a diabetic (which prompted this post). In fact, since April, I only get 3-4 hours of sleep.

Pops told me, as of recent, the house is paid off, so mortgage is no longer an issue, but the other bills and property taxes will still be a concern. Cool... And yet, no job still. This means I've been unemployed since the beginning of 2021, and combined with my paranoia of pop's future, I estimate I have less than a year to do SOMETHING, but I don't even know where to even start anymore.

Wala pang breakfast, no coffeee tapos ayun first call of the day. Si customer hindi masyado marunong mag English. Hindi mapronounce ng maayos and mga letters and numbers sa account number nya.

We matched on a dating app and had really intense chemistry from the beginning. We quickly exchanged numbers and talked every day on FaceTime, sometimes more than once a day. I would say we had much in common and felt good in others company. First minute into the first date and we kissed in his flat, which he expressed he would like to even before we met and I also thought the same thing.

We had a nice date and continued to talk every day. He just got a new cat, and it just had moved in…so we couldn’t meet at my place the second time which was fine for me. He was very sweet and seemed really into me with giving me cute nicknames and telling me how attractive I am etc. He quickly became an important person in my life.

For the third date he suggested going out with his best friends, which I took as a good sign. He also said he would love to get to know my mum maybe someday. We exchanged Shirts to keep the other one company till we see each other again and kept them as cushion covers with he doing it before me. I thought it was really cute. He also told me that I am important and special to him.

The last time we met I asked how we stand and that’s when things changed. He said he had so much going on with work right now, his cat (which behaved a little weird) and his health so he wasn’t really sure if he was ready right now. I believed him because he was really eager to leave his work, which he was really unhappy and stressed about with all the time and wanted to go to a college in September and had a lot of planning to do. He was even on sick leave because he couldn’t handle the work and his Boss anymore, which was an absolute bad person as he told me and tried to make his life hell. Also my friends didn’t think there was something wrong with his explanation. It was really a stressful time for him but he assured me that it was his problem and had nothing to do with me. As i am an overthinker I told him he could just tell me if he didn’t feel the same about me and just be honest, but he still said it didn’t had to do something with me. He even said he didn’t want to date someone new till he entered college and  managed all his stuff. In hindsight I know this is the point I should have left but I didn’t bc I kinda still had hope and really liked him. I also asked if I interpreted getting to know his friends wrong and he said something like: Oh I am just very open and if I think they get along with my friends I introduce them. I know everyone is different but I personally wouldn’t introduce my friends on the third date if I wasn’t really sure about them. Of course I was really sad about his decision and the person that i am it made me sad and i cried in front of him and he comforted me as best as he could.

After that contact declined bc he wanted space which I accepted bc I thought it would also be good for me. He also got a second cat and he said he has a lot of stress bc it doesn’t really did get along with his first cat and bc of this he haven’t slept in a few days and didn’t want to communicate with everyone. Still I saw his Insta Storys where he went out for a coffee with his best friend etc. I also had a weird feeling that made check his dating profile which he updated. Previously he had deleted his apps but he said it was just because he was looking for friends. We had a little bit of a fight but settled it with him saying maybe we can start again over someday. I agreed and we decided to send each other the T-Shirts back, even though he said I could keep his or throw it away. It was a basic white T-Shirt which he has probably 10 or more and it wasn’t something special to him. I still wanted to send him the Shirt and said that I will do it shortly. I did do the next week but without telling him I did it bc we just spoke about it the week before.

We continued to snap each other but like nothing special till i had a weak moment and did send him a normal snap with a „Miss you“ text. He deleted me on Snap and I am pretty sure he blocked me. I was really angry at myself and I still am bc I felt like I overstepped his boundaries and I felt really stupid bc of that. That was when the real stress began. He still had my shirt, which was special to me and had a emotional value, because I bought it last year when I was in America for the first time. And yes, he knew about the value it had for me.

After one and a half week I wrote him if he did send my shirt bc I haven’t received anything yet which he declined. I told him to do it soon so I can close the whole situation for me. The next week I received a package but it wasn’t my stuff but instead his stuff which came back bc he didn’t pick it up. I did send it again although I could have just thrown it away. He said he didn’t pick it up bc he thought it was a scam and he didn’t expect something and blamed me that I didn’t tell him, even though I said I will send him his stuff shortly. I didn’t think he needed an extra confirmation when we talked about it the week before that. In the meantime he didn’t send my shirt and I kinda had to „threaten“ him that I would come and pick it up myself. He replied he would do it the next day and eventually it came later the next week.

I blocked him on Insta and his number and even took a break of Insta. In short, he had my shirt for a total of two and a half months, five weeks of that where he couldn’t  manage to send my shirt and I managed to do it two times. I haven’t seen him for three months but couldn’t close the situation bc of that damned Shirt, that just arrived like two weeks ago.

I carry a severe amount of guilt and shame that I didn’t left much sooner when I should have but we had such an special connection (I thought) that I couldn’t leave and maybe I was just more into him then he was into me but then I don’t understand whey he wasn’t just honest with me, even if he always preached how important open and honest communication is. I also ruminate about if it ended differently when I did not send the „Miss you“ Snap. I still don’t think that justifies his actions for his behavior to just keep my stuff for as long as he did, exspecially because he knew, how important it is for me. I really wanted more with that person but now I wonder if I even knew him enough? We only met four times but always for two days bc I spend the night there and we talked every day on FaceTime in between, sometimes more then once a day or for hours. I know I am a person that attaches quickly but he also matched my energy so I thought he wanted the same. I still catch myself thinking of him and what could have been if I behaved differently, especially after it was his birthday yesterday. And I know it will take sometime getting over him completely. I also still have the stupid hope of forgiving him and me and  trying to reconnect someday. I really don’t know if I should or should not. I don’t even know if I should unblock him someday on Insta or just keep him blocked forever. I know it always takes two but I still have the feeling I ruined it all and it’s all my fault. I just feel lost. I had trust issues even before that so how I am supposed to trust someone again and let him in my life after that happend? I wonder, if he even liked me or I meant something to him. Still, I hate the idea of never talking to him or seeing him again. ",1,1749123846.0,makemychoice,0,1.0,False

# 06:00 – The Wake-Up Call

The alarm goes off. Not a real one—just the scheduled refresh firing like clockwork.

I lurch awake as the Fabric pipeline gently slaps me with a full table load from the Lakehouse. Perfect. Nothing like chugging 3 million rows of raw transactional data before I've had a chance to defrag my thoughts.

""Where's the coffee?"" I whisper to myself.

Oh right. The closest thing I get is a DirectQuery hit to a SQL view with six nested subqueries. Pure bliss.

# 06:15 – The Shape-Shifting Ritual

Power Query Editor shows up next—chaotic neutral in human form.

Today, she's decided to insert a new step right in the middle of the transform chain because some analyst dragged a column by accident and forgot to delete it.

She doesn't care that it breaks half my applied steps and forces a recalculation of everything. She just shrugs, whispers, ""You'll figure it out,"" and vanishes into the Applied Steps void.

# 07:00 – Morning Stretch (a.k.a. Relationship Checks)

Time to check on my relationships. You'd think they'd be simple.

But no—one fact table is trying to date a dimension table through three different keys.

One of them is ambiguous.

One of them is inactive.

And one is... missing entirely.

I consult the model diagram for help. But it's a mess. A circular reference is forming in the corner. It hisses when I hover near it.

# 09:00 – The Users Are Awake

This is when the chaos begins. People start slicing and dicing me in ways I was never built for.

Someone just dragged \[Profit Margin %\] into a bar chart sliced by Customer Segment, Product SKU, and Month. I calculate 942 DAX measures in 1.8 seconds.

They don't say thank you.

Someone else is comparing this year's revenue to Q2 of 2021, filtered by customers who only ever bought blue socks. Classic Tuesday.

# 12:00 – Lunch Break (Just Kidding)

No rest. Someone just added a new column in the Excel source sheet. Column names shifted. Everything broke.

Now \[Revenue\] is pulling from what used to be \[Country\], and \[Date\] is showing up as a decimal.

I scream into the Query Dependencies view, but it's already too late.

# 14:30 – The DAX Interns Try to Help

They mean well. But one of them just wrote a measure using EARLIER() inside a SUMX() inside a FILTER(), all wrapped in CALCULATE().

I try to process it, but halfway through, I black out and throw an error:

""The function EARLIER/EARLIEST refers to an earlier row context which doesn't exist.""

He replies: ""Weird, it worked yesterday.""

# 16:00 – Gateway Gremlin Pays a Visit

They only show up to ruin my day.

Connection failed.

Gateway is offline.

Credentials expired.

Have I tried turning it off and on again?

They log a support ticket and CC 17 people. Then disappear.

# 18:00 – The Final Performance

Dashboards go live. Executives log in. Everything slows to a crawl.

Someone's report has four slicers and a line chart with five measure variations calculated on the fly. It's beautiful. It's horrific. I'm sweating rows.

Then, someone clicks ""Export Data"" on a visual with 89,000 rows. I pretend not to notice. It'll time out anyway.

# 21:00 – Night Mode

Everything quiets down. Scheduled refreshes are done. Users are logged out.

I run a quick self-check: 247 measures, 19 tables, 7 inactive relationships, and one weirdly named column: Column3 (2).

I shut down slowly, hoping no one schedules a last-minute refresh.

# Closing Thoughts from Your Tired Data Model:

You might only see polished bar charts, slick KPIs, and beautifully clean tooltips. But behind every pixel is a whole crew of wild characters: DAX formulas with too much confidence, query steps doing improv, refresh schedules with no respect for weekends, and relationships hanging on by a thread.

So next time you click a slicer and your visual updates in under two seconds—just know I fought for that moment.

And tomorrow? We do it all again.

Turns out after I left for my workout. She was telling him she recognized me. Said cool stuff about me, my parents, and how she know’s my orders. Pointed a few things out about me too. Then she asked him for my name.

I loved watching the neighborhood wake up and go to sleep…the comings and goings of neighbors, the birds, the squirrels, the bunnies…and Frederick.

Frederick was the neighborhood skunk, and he was my favorite neighbor. 

See, Frederick was *smart*, and Frederick was also a *jerk prankster*.

Every morning and every evening — and usually more than once — Frederick would choose a neighbor to harass. I swear he knew everyone’s schedules. He’d choose a driveway, lie in wait, and amble onto it and plop down just as the driver was turning into their driveway. 

And every time, the driver would stop, wait for Frederick to move, realize he was not going to do such a thing, back out, and start driving the loop around the parking area… at which point Frederick would amble off to lie in wait again until the neighbor started to turn back into their driveway. 

He’d always make them try to pull into their garage at least twice. Occasionally, he’d push his luck with four or five. Usually, it was two or three. 

I loved that little jerk. We moved to a different neighborhood a few years ago, and my new view is skunk free, but I hope Frederick is still over there living his best prankster life.",3,1749123436.0,PointlessStories,1,1.0,False

I was always interested in witchcraft and have always been surrounded by rituals and divination. My mom was a really accurate coffee grounds reader, my aunt does energy work, my whole family shares superstitions and rituals disguised under religion and Christianity (but they are quite magickal, actually). I have a Slavic background and would love to go in this direction, but I hardly found any good material on Slavic rituals/deities/magick. 

Now I've had some experiences here and there and I know that this is a path that suits me, but I just don't know where and how to start. There is so much material to do research on, I just looked at the megathread regarding the books to start with, I considered just starting out with demon rituals, but it is quite overwhelming for me. 

So I thought I'd ask for the simplest guide or tip on what I can do that would keep me motivated to keep going. 

I've started tarot, but got overwhelmed with learning the meaning of every card. 

I can do some coffee ground reading, but I can only do readings on myself and I feel that they turn out to be too biased. 

I did some small rituals with intention, but I can't tell if they work or not. 

I thought about doing something about my annoying neighbors, but I don't know if a sour jar, or burning their name written on a piece of paper is a good first thing to do, or if it will eventually backfire. 

I wanted to start a money jar, but I'm too afraid that I will loose money rather than gain some. 

I thought about cleansing my apartment and hanging up some mirrors to ward off negative energy, but sometimes I feel like an imposter. 

Is it better to start with candles? Gems? Astrology? Tarot? Any spells? I am pretty much open to anything and can't put my finger on what would fit best. Trying out everything seems hard and expensive (I'd have to get gems that I may not use anymore, candles, and so on). Sadly I'm on a budget at the moment. If there is any cheap way to finding out what would suit me best, please let me know!

I hope someone understands where I'm coming from and can just give me a helpful tip on where they started, some small things I can do in my day to day life that will show me that what I'm doing actually works, and motivates me to keep going. 

If anything good happens in my life I always try to thank the universe for it (in my mind). Sometimes it takes me some time to notice what happened. Sometimes I wonder if someone/something else helped me out, or if it's ""good enough"" to thank the universe for whatever happened since it's such a broad/general term. 

tl;dr: I am overwhelmed with the amount of information that is available and I don't know where and how to start. I am looking for something beginner-friendly that keeps me motivated and is easy to incorporate into day-to-day life.

I’ve been using it for a while now, and honestly, it’s pretty impressive for a home coffee machine in this price range.

# Easy to Use — No Barista Skills Needed

First off, this machine is super user-friendly. You don’t have to be a barista or have any fancy coffee-making skills to get that nice crema on your espresso or a perfectly frothy cappuccino. 

It’s got a simple control panel that lets you switch between espresso, cappuccino, and latte modes with ease. 

So, if you want to switch from a strong, bold espresso shot to a smooth, creamy latte, it’s literally just a button away.

# Frothing System That Works

What I really like about the Nescafé E is its frothing system. The milk frother creates that velvety foam which feels so satisfying — like you’re actually sipping coffee from a cafe, not your kitchen. 

I’ve tried it with both dairy and plant-based milk, and it works pretty well either way. 

Plus, cleaning the frother is straightforward, which is a win because nobody wants to spend ages scrubbing tiny parts.

# Compact & Stylish Design

Another thing — it’s compact. If you have a small kitchen or limited counter space, this won’t crowd your space. The build feels sturdy, and the black finish looks sleek enough to blend well with any kitchen setup.

# Taste & Performance

Now, for the taste. I won’t lie, the espresso it pulls is decent — not the kind you’d get from a super expensive, high-end espresso machine, but definitely solid enough to satisfy most home coffee lovers. 

The coffee is rich, and the crema adds that authentic touch. 

Plus, the machine heats up quickly, so no waiting forever for your caffeine fix.

# A Couple of Downsides

If I had to point out a downside, it’s that the water tank is a bit on the smaller side, so you might have to refill it if you’re making multiple cups in one go. 

Also, it’s designed mainly for Nescafé capsules, so if you’re looking to use freshly ground beans, this might not be the best fit.

# Final Thoughts: Is It For You?

Overall, if you want a hassle-free, affordable espresso machine that can whip up cafe-style drinks without complicating your mornings, this is a solid choice.

1l3wvjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpeerMethod/comments/1l3wvjd/future_pacing_in_dating_leading_with_vision/,Future Pacing in Dating: Leading with Vision,"""future pacing"" isn't a manipulative tactic; it's a powerful tool for a man with a strong mindset to lead with vision, test compatibility, and subtly vet a partner's alignment with his long-term goals.

 It's about painting a picture of a potential shared future, not to force commitment, but to gauge receptiveness and build a deeper sense of connection and possibility.

What is Future Pacing?

Future pacing is the subtle art of discussing, hinting at, or creating hypothetical scenarios about shared experiences that lie ahead. 

It shifts the conversation from the immediate present to a future that could include both of you. It's not about proposing marriage on the first date; it's about demonstrating your comfort with a future, your intentionality, and your ability to plan beyond the next coffee.

Why Does It Matter (The Speer Method Perspective)?

Tests Compatibility & Intent: It's a crucial vetting mechanism. You're not just looking for present chemistry; you're assessing if your life paths and values align on a deeper level. Does she light up at the idea of future travel, or cringe at the thought of meeting your family?

Demonstrates Confidence & Leadership: A man who can envision and articulate a future is a man who leads. It shows you're not just drifting, but have a sense of direction and are comfortable integrating someone significant into your life.

Builds Deeper Connection: It creates a sense of shared adventure and possibility. By jointly imagining positive future scenarios, you foster a subconscious bond and a feeling of ""we"" that strengthens the relationship.

Seeds Commitment (Subtly): While not demanding, it gently introduces the idea of longevity. If someone consistently engages positively with future pacing, it indicates a receptiveness to a long-term connection.

How to Implement Future Pacing Effectively:

The key is to keep it casual, observational, and non-demanding. It should flow naturally from your conversation, not feel like an interrogation or a premature proposal.

Tie it to Shared Interests:Example: If you both love hiking: ""Next summer, when the weather's perfect, we should really hit that trail up in the mountains I told you about.

""Example: If you discover a shared love for a band: ""When [Band Name] comes through town again, we're definitely going to have to catch that show.

""Relate it to Current Activities:

Example (after a good meal): ""We'll have to come back here when their summer menu drops

.""Example (watching a movie): ""They're releasing a sequel next year; we'll have to watch it together when it comes out.

""Discuss Broader Life Visions (with caution):

Example: ""I'm looking to get a place with a bit more outdoor space next year; I can just picture setting up a grill and hosting some friends back there."" (Gauge her reaction to the idea of a future ""we"" in that context).

Example: ""I've always wanted to do a big trip through Southeast Asia. Imagine spending a month just exploring different cultures...

""Incorporate Their Interests: If she mentions loving a specific type of art, ""There's an exhibition coming up at [Museum Name] in a few months that you'd probably love.

The goal is to see if she engages positively with the idea of a shared future.Key Principles for a Strong Mindset:Lead, Don't Push: You're presenting a vision, not trapping them. The goal is to see if they willingly step into that vision with you.

Gauge Receptiveness: Pay close attention to her reaction. Does she smile? Engage enthusiastically? Or does she change the subject, seem uncomfortable, or give vague responses? 

Her reaction tells you everything.It's a Vetting Tool: If she consistently shies away from any future-oriented talk, it's a signal. Either she's not interested in a long-term connection with you, or she's simply not ready for commitment. Both are valid reasons for you to assess compatibility.

Authenticity Over Strategy: Future pacing must come from genuine desire and an honest vision for your life. If you're faking it, it will feel inauthentic and manipulative.Don't Overdo It: Balance future talk with present-moment connection. You still need to build rapport and chemistry in the here and now.

Differentiating from Love-Bombing/Creepiness:Future pacing, done correctly, is a sign of healthy intentionality.

 It becomes a red flag when:
It's Too Fast & Intense: Demanding answers about marriage and kids on the first few dates (as seen in a previous example) is love-bombing, not pacing.
It's One-Sided: You're constantly pushing future scenarios without her engagement or contribution. 

It Ignores Boundaries: You're forcing it when she's clearly uncomfortable or signals she's not ready.

It's About Control: The intent isn't to explore a shared future, but to lock someone down.

Future pacing, from a strong mindset, is about confidently articulating your vision for life and seeing if another individual authentically and enthusiastically wants to build that vision with you. It's a proactive step in building a relationship of purpose and alignment.

## What is Puls Bitcoin?

Puls Bitcoin is an **automated crypto trading platform** that uses algorithms to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on your behalf. Think of it like a crypto assistant that never sleeps—analyzing market data 24/7 and executing trades based on pre-set strategies.

It’s designed for both beginners and advanced users. Beginners can rely on the automation, while advanced users can tweak settings and strategies. It aims to **remove emotion from trading**, which is a big deal because let’s face it, we’ve all made a panic sale or two.

## Who Created Puls Bitcoin?

Details about the creators of Puls Bitcoin are a bit sparse, which is pretty common in the crypto bot scene. But here’s what I found: it seems to be built by a group of **experienced developers and crypto traders**, possibly the same team behind platforms like Immediate Edge or Bitcoin Code.

While this lack of transparency might seem sketchy at first, it's not uncommon in the automated trading world. The platform still appears to be **functional and widely used**, and there are no major red flags in terms of operations or user feedback.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Puls Bitcoin Today](https://t.co/H8MtVKbD6C)
## How Does Puls Bitcoin Work?

Puls Bitcoin uses **AI-driven algorithms** and machine learning models to perform trades. It scans the crypto markets in real-time, looking for profitable opportunities. Once it finds one, it places trades automatically using your deposited funds.

You can either:
- **Let the bot trade fully automatically**, or
- **Manually adjust trading settings**, like risk level, amount per trade, and which coins to prioritize.

It integrates with third-party brokers to execute trades, which is pretty standard practice. The AI claims to have a high accuracy rate, though like any trading tool, **profits are never guaranteed**.

## Puls Bitcoin Pros and Cons

Let’s break this down real quick:

### Pros:
- **Easy to use**, even for beginners
- **Fully automated trading** saves you time
- **No download required** – works in-browser
- **Customizable alerts** and preferences
- **Supports multiple cryptocurrencies**
- **24/7 trading** – never misses an opportunity

### Cons:
- **Minimum $250 deposit** might be steep for casual users
- **No mobile app yet**, only mobile-optimized site
- **Lack of transparency** about founders
- **Not available in all countries**

### [👉 Open Your Puls Bitcoin Account Now](https://t.co/H8MtVKbD6C)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access Puls Bitcoin?

Puls Bitcoin is **web-based**, so there’s no software to download. You can access it through:

- **Desktop** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Smartphones** (iOS and Android browsers)
- **Tablets**

Basically, if your device has a browser and internet connection, you’re good to go. You don’t need a fancy setup—just a decent connection and maybe a coffee.

## Puls Bitcoin – Supported Countries

The platform is available in **most countries**, with a few exceptions due to regulatory restrictions. Based on what I found, it’s **not available** in:

- United States
- Canada
- North Korea
- Iran

If you’re outside of those zones, you’re probably good to go. Always double-check during sign-up—they’ll usually flag your region if it’s restricted.

## Puls Bitcoin – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is one of Puls Bitcoin’s standout features. The platform uses real-time data to **analyze trends, spot patterns, and predict potential movements** before making a trade. It’s like having your own personal analyst, minus the coffee breaks.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is super clean. Even if you’ve never traded a day in your life, you won’t feel overwhelmed. Everything is laid out in a way that just makes sense—**simple menus, easy toggles, and helpful tooltips** along the way.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no dedicated mobile app (yet), the **mobile browser version works surprisingly well**. It’s optimized for smaller screens, so you can track performance, adjust settings, and even initiate withdrawals on the go.

### Customizable Alerts

Wanna know when Bitcoin breaks $60k? Or when Ethereum drops 5%? You can set up **custom alerts** to keep you updated on market moves. It’s a great way to stay informed without being glued to your screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not just limited to Bitcoin. Puls Bitcoin lets you **trade multiple cryptos**, including:
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Litecoin (LTC)
- Ripple (XRP)
- And even some altcoins, depending on your broker

## Is Puls Bitcoin a Scam?

From my research, Puls Bitcoin doesn’t raise any major red flags. It functions as advertised, users are able to deposit and withdraw, and the bot does what it says it will.

That said, **always be cautious**. The crypto world is full of shady actors, so never invest more than you’re willing to lose. Also, remember that no platform can guarantee profits 100% of the time—**that’s just reality**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Puls Bitcoin?

The platform requires a **minimum deposit of $250** to activate your account and begin trading. This is pretty standard for most automated platforms, but yeah—it’s not exactly pocket change.

Still, if the bot performs well, that initial deposit could potentially multiply. Just make sure you're only using **disposable income**, not your rent money.

### Puls Bitcoin Customer Support

Support is available 24/7 through:
- **Live chat**
- **Email**
- **Phone (in some cases)**

From what I tested, responses were pretty quick during normal hours. If you’re having a technical issue or just need help understanding a feature, they’re actually helpful—not just copy-paste bots.

## How do you start trading on Puls Bitcoin?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the Puls Bitcoin homepage and fill in your name, email, and phone number. Takes about a minute. Once you're in, you’ll get redirected to a dashboard.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll be partnered with a broker (randomly assigned based on your region). You’ll need to verify your identity—usually just a government-issued ID and proof of address. Then, deposit **at least $250** to start trading.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can:
- **Go full auto-mode**, or
- **Customize your trading settings**

You can also activate demo trading to see how everything works before risking real money.

## How to Delete a Puls Bitcoin Account?

If you ever want out, just contact support and request an account deletion. They'll likely ask for identity verification to confirm it’s really you (which is a good thing). Once confirmed, your data gets wiped and your account is deactivated.

## The Verdict

So, is Puls Bitcoin worth your time?

If you’re looking for a **hands-off way to trade crypto**, Puls Bitcoin offers a solid blend of automation, customization, and user-friendliness. It’s not perfect—there’s no mobile app, and the $250 minimum can be a hurdle—but overall, it delivers on its core promise.

Would I recommend it? **Yeah, especially for beginners** or those who don’t want to spend hours analyzing charts. Just remember to start small, use the demo mode, and keep your expectations realistic. It’s a tool—not a magic money printer.

I live in a rural area where there are no jobs, especially for my experience. I'd love to move back to the city but can't because of all the stuff ( poor housing market, high interest rates, high rents, depressed salary, inflation etc).

Now they're pushing RTO hard, claiming their monitoring. New ceo mandate. 

My drive can range from 1 hr 15 mins to 1 hr 40 mins each way. For 3 days it costs about $90 gas per week. Increased maintenance and all the other stuff, comes out to about $550 a month, not to mention buying lunch when I forget or don't have time to prepare, etc. I will need to get a new car soon because mine is not going to be able to handle the drive. I will probably need to finance so thinking that will be minimum $400 mo payment plus increased car insurance. 

Week 6 and I'm so fucking exhausted. I'm working less hours than wfh because I'm at work 9 hours, with hour lunch, and have up to 3 hour commute so 12 hour days. I am not productive for those 8 hours I'm working. I'm just exhausted and distracted.  I am completely overloaded with the amount of work due to the political environment significantly impacting my job duties.

The worst part is I don't work with anyone at my location. Everyone I interact with is in other parts of the country. I spend all day at my desk alone. There's about 150 cubicles in my area and maybe 10 people on a busy day when a lot of people come in at the same time. I'm in the dark a lot of the day, have to swing my arms around so the motion sensor lights stay on. They don't provide coffee, cream, sugar, plates, utensils or anything like that and we are responsible for taking our own garbage out. We do get paper towels, toilet paper, Water and a microwave. I believe the women get tampons in their bathroom.

The long drive is killing my back. Job market sux right now, especially for remote work. I feel so stuck and this isn't sustainable. Besides the exhaustion, the frustration and mental stress is taking. There's already so much work n pressure n now my hours and productivity are taking a hit.

I'm thinking about just not doing it. Go in one day a week til I get reprimanded and eventually fired. Anyone else take this approach?

The [COSTAR 2-in-1 Espresso Machine ](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0CDBY4BDC?tag=rahulbhatia-21&th=1)caught my eye because of its unique dual-brewing setup, so I decided to try it out and see if it lives up to the hype.

# What’s “2-in-1” Actually Mean?

This machine lets you brew using **ground coffee** or **coffee capsules**, which is surprisingly rare in this price range. It’s like having the best of both worlds—use your favorite blend on lazy weekends, and pop in a capsule when you’re rushing out the door.

# Pressure and Performance

The 20-bar pump does its job. Espresso comes out rich and creamy, with that **golden crema** on top that feels like a flex. It heats up quickly too—around 45 seconds. You don’t have to babysit it, which I love.

# Maintenance: Not a Chore

Removable drip tray, detachable water tank, and descaling alert. It’s basically telling you, “Relax, I got this.” Cleaning this thing is honestly not the headache I expected, even with regular use.

# Design Vibes

It’s sleek and compact—fits right in my cramped kitchen. The **LED panel is intuitive**, no random beeping or rocket-science instructions. The milk frother works well, though don’t expect ultra-professional steam control like high-end baristas.

# What Could’ve Been Better?

* The **capsule compatibility** is decent but limited to a few types, so you might have to experiment to find the best match.
* The milk frother could be more adjustable. It’s solid for cappuccinos, but not ideal for experimenting with microfoam for lattes.

# Final Verdict

If you’re looking for a **versatile, entry-level espresso machine** that doesn’t lock you into one brewing style, **COSTAR’s 2-in-1** is honestly a solid pick. It's beginner-friendly, fast, and won’t blow your wallet.

It’s no longer about having a good time, trying new things, or even enjoying good food — it’s all about whether the place looks “aesthetic” enough for Instagram. Every weekend now revolves around cafes with neon signs, overpriced iced teas, and posing for photos that half of us don’t even post.

Just recently, a friend came to visit Bangalore. I was genuinely excited and suggested we go Go-karting or grab some amazing Desi Chinese from a stall I know — proper nostalgic, flavorful food and actual fun. He flat-out refused. Instead, we ended up doing the typical “Instagram Bangalore tour”: Church Street, cafes, more cafes, and coffee after coffee after coffee. The entire day was just walking through crowded streets, taking half-hearted photos, and sipping on mediocre beverages. That was it.

I ended up spending 2k on what felt like a staged photoshoot with no actual substance. Zero fun, zero excitement. Just vibes and filters.

I miss the old days when plans meant laughter, adrenaline, good food, and spontaneous fun — not curating a reel. Why does everything have to be for social media now? When did *looking* like you're having fun become more important than actually *having* it?

The digital nomad lifestyle is often painted as the ultimate escape from the mundane grind of traditional employment\. You work remotely\, travel the world\, and supposedly live life on your own terms\. But beneath this glittering facade lies a complex reality that few discuss openly\. It’s not all beachfront Wi\-Fi and exotic coffee shops\. There are shadows cast by the spotlight of freedom\, and understanding them is crucial before you dive headfirst into this mobile existence\.

The allure of location independence is undeniable\. No more commuting\, no more office politics\, no more feeling like a cog in a machine\.

Unlike a traditional job with a steady paycheck\, remote work often means irregular income and unpredictable cash flow\. Projects can vanish overnight\, clients can disappear without explanation\, and the gig economy is rife with uncertainty\. This lack of stability can lead to anxiety and stress\, especially when trying to plan for the future or manage expenses in different currencies and cost\-of\-living environments \.

High travel and living expenses compound this issue\. While some destinations offer affordable accommodations\, others can be surprisingly expensive\, especially when factoring in flights\, visas\, insurance\, and daily necessities\. The dream of working from a tropical paradise can quickly turn into a budget nightmare if you’re not careful\. And let’s not forget about the emotional toll of constantly moving—packing up\, finding new places to stay\, and adjusting to unfamiliar surroundings is exhausting\, both mentally and physically\.

The emotional toll of constant movement is another elephant in the room\. Loneliness and isolation are common experiences for digital nomads\, even among those who appear to have everything figured out\. You’re always the outsider\, never fully part of any community\. Friendships are fleeting\, and romantic relationships are hard to sustain when one partner is always on the move\. The nomadic life can become a solitary journey\, where connection feels like a luxury rather than a right \.

Struggling with identity and belonging adds another layer of complexity\. When you don’t have a home base\, it’s easy to lose touch with who you are\. You become defined by your transient nature\, and that can erode your sense of self over time\. Are you a traveler\? A worker\? A wanderer\? Or something else entirely\? Without roots\, it’s challenging to cultivate a stable identity\, and that disconnection can manifest in unexpected ways\.

Maintaining meaningful connections across time zones is a Herculean task\. Even with modern communication tools\, bridging the gap between continents is difficult\. Time zone differences mean late\-night calls or early\-morning messages\, which can strain relationships and create a sense of imbalance\. Plus\, the effort required to keep up with loved ones’ lives while managing your own can be overwhelming\. It’s a juggling act that rarely ends well \.

Navigating romantic commitments while on the move is equally tricky\. Relationships require presence\, consistency\, and shared experiences—all things that are hard to maintain when one person is always somewhere else\. The nomadic life often demands compromise\, and not everyone is willing to make it\. Eventually\, the question becomes whether the relationship can survive the distance\, or if it will inevitably fall apart under the strain \.

Physical health risks from unpredictable schedules are another concern\. When your days are dictated by client meetings\, deadlines\, and travel plans\, self\-care often takes a back seat\. Sleep patterns become erratic\, exercise routines get neglected\, and nutrition suffers\. The body is not designed for chaos\, and the long\-term effects of this lifestyle can be detrimental to your overall well\-being \.

Mental health struggles in a transient existence are equally pervasive\. The pressure to constantly perform\, adapt\, and remain productive can lead to burnout\. Add in the loneliness\, the uncertainty\, and the lack of routine\, and you have a perfect storm for anxiety and depression\. Many digital nomads suffer in silence\, afraid to admit they’re struggling because it goes against the image of invincibility they project \.

Taxation and immigration complexities are legal hurdles that many overlook\. Working remotely from multiple countries creates a tangled web of tax obligations\, visa requirements\, and regulatory compliance\. It’s easy to assume that because you’re working online\, you’re exempt from local laws\, but nothing could be further from the truth\. Failing to understand these nuances can lead to serious consequences\, including fines\, deportation\, or legal action \.

Access to healthcare and social security benefits is another gray area\. Most countries have systems in place for residents\, but as a digital nomad\, you’re often in limbo\. Emergency medical care can be costly\, and without proper insurance\, you’re left vulnerable\. Social security contributions are also unclear\, leaving you without a safety net in case of unemployment or disability \.

The pressure to always be productive is relentless\. In a world where hustle culture is glorified\, taking breaks feels like a failure\. But the truth is\, human beings need rest\, reflection\, and downtime to function optimally\. Without clear boundaries\, work\-life balance becomes a myth\, and burnout is inevitable\. The nomadic life doesn’t provide the same structure as a traditional job\, so it’s up to you to enforce discipline—and that’s easier said than done \.

Difficulty establishing routine and boundaries compounds this problem\. When your workspace is a café table\, a co\-working space\, or a park bench\, it’s hard to separate work from play\. The line between productivity and leisure blurs\, and guilt sets in when you’re not working\. Over time\, this lack of structure can erode your motivation and diminish your quality of life \.

Missing out on corporate ladder climbing is another downside\. While freelancing offers flexibility\, it often lacks the career progression found in traditional jobs\. Promotions\, raises\, and mentorship opportunities are rare in the gig economy\, and building long\-term credibility requires constant reinvention\. For those who value professional growth\, this can be a significant drawback \.

Lack of mentorship and professional development is similarly problematic\. Remote work isolates you from colleagues\, managers\, and industry leaders who could offer guidance and support\. Without face\-to\-face interactions\, learning from others becomes harder\, and staying updated on industry trends requires extra effort\. This disconnect can stifle growth and limit your ability to advance in your field \.

Misunderstandings and communication gaps arise frequently due to cultural and language barriers\. Even if you speak the local language fluently\, nuances and idioms can trip you up\. Cultural norms vary widely\, and what’s acceptable in one country may be offensive in another\. These missteps can lead to awkward situations\, damaged relationships\, and missed opportunities \.

Adapting to local norms and expectations is a continuous challenge\. From dress codes to business etiquette\, every new destination brings a fresh set of rules to navigate\. What works in one city may fail spectacularly in another\, and the pressure to fit in can be exhausting\. It’s a balancing act between respecting local customs and maintaining your authentic self \.

The carbon footprint from frequent travel is a growing ethical dilemma\. While digital nomadism promotes freedom\, it also contributes to environmental degradation\. Airplanes emit greenhouse gases\, and the demand for short\-term rentals in popular destinations strains local resources\. As awareness of climate change increases\, the sustainability of this lifestyle is coming under scrutiny \.

Exploitation of low\-cost destinations is another contentious issue\. Many digital nomads flock to countries with cheap living costs\, driving up rent and putting pressure on local economies\. This influx can displace residents and disrupt communities\, raising questions about responsibility and fairness\. It’s important to consider the impact of your choices and find ways to contribute positively to the places you visit \.

Risk of theft and personal data breaches is a real concern\. When you’re constantly on the move\, securing your belongings and sensitive information becomes a priority\. Laptops\, smartphones\, and cloud accounts are all potential targets\, and a single breach can derail your entire operation\. Cybersecurity threats are ever\-present\, and vigilance is essential to protect your digital assets \.

Navigating unsafe or unstable regions is another risk factor\. Not all locations are created equal\, and some may pose physical dangers to travelers\. Political unrest\, natural disasters\, and crime rates vary by region\, and staying informed is critical to your safety\. It’s easy to underestimate the risks until you’re faced with them firsthand \.

Seasonal fluctuations in gig availability can leave you scrambling for work\. Demand for remote services varies throughout the year\, and certain industries experience downturns during specific months\. If you rely on a single source of income\, these lulls can be financially devastating\. Diversifying your offerings and building a buffer is essential to weather the ups and downs \.

Competition from global talent pools is fierce\. With the internet connecting professionals worldwide\, standing out in the crowd is harder than ever\. Clients have access to a vast array of freelancers\, and price undercutting is common\. To succeed\, you must differentiate yourself through unique skills\, strong branding\, and consistent performance\. It’s a Darwinian landscape where only the fittest survive \.

Lack of stability and permanence can lead to a sense of homelessness in disguise\. While you may have a passport and a suitcase\, you often lack a true home\. This rootlessness can create a paradox—being everywhere yet nowhere\, free yet trapped\. The absence of a fixed address can make it difficult to form lasting bonds and build a life that feels grounded \.

Reliance on internet connectivity is a vulnerability many take for granted\. When your livelihood depends on a stable connection\, any disruption can bring everything to a halt\. Public Wi\-Fi is unreliable\, and data caps can be restrictive\. Investing in backup solutions is necessary\, but it adds to the cost and complexity of this lifestyle \.

Cybersecurity threats and data loss are constant worries\. Hackers target digital nomads because they’re often less secure than traditional businesses\. Phishing attacks\, malware\, and ransomware are just a few of the dangers lurking in the digital world\. Protecting your data requires vigilance\, and even then\, no system is completely foolproof \.

Saturation of popular nomad\-friendly cities is becoming a problem\. Once\-hidden gems are now overrun with expats\, driving up costs and diminishing the charm\. Local cultures are eroded\, and the sense of discovery is lost\. Finding truly unique experiences is getting harder\, and the novelty wears thin after a while \.

Erosion of local culture and community is a consequence of this saturation\. As more digital nomads flood in\, the character of a place changes\. Businesses cater to tourists\, and the original inhabitants are pushed out\. This shift can create resentment and tension\, and it’s important to be mindful of how your presence affects the people around you \.

Losing sense of self amid constant change is a psychological toll many face\. When your environment is always shifting\, so does your identity\. You become defined by your movements rather than your values\, and that can lead to confusion and dissatisfaction\. Reconnecting with who you are outside of the nomadic label is essential for long\-term fulfillment \.

Questioning the value of a nomadic pursuit is a natural evolution\. At some point\, the thrill of the unknown gives way to introspection\. Why are you doing this\? Is it worth the trade\-offs\? These questions can be uncomfortable\, but they’re necessary for growth\. Only by confronting them can you determine if this path aligns with your deeper purpose \.

Blurred lines between work and leisure are a double\-edged sword\. On one hand\, you have the freedom to choose when and where you work\. On the other hand\, the lack of separation can lead to guilt and anxiety\. You’re always expected to be available\, and the pressure to deliver results never truly disappears\. Learning to disconnect is a skill that must be cultivated\, not assumed \.

Guilt and anxiety from never fully disconnecting are common afflictions\. Even when you’re off\-duty\, the nagging thought that you should be working lingers\. This mindset can rob you of the joy and spontaneity that made you want to travel in the first place\. It’s a cycle that’s hard to break\, but breaking it is essential for mental peace \.

Challenges in saving for retirement are a sobering reality\. Traditional pension systems are tied to geographic locations\, and many digital nomads struggle to participate in them\. Without a structured savings plan\, the future feels uncertain\. It’s easy to focus on today’s adventures and neglect tomorrow’s needs\, but financial planning is non\-negotiable for long\-term success \.

Uncertainty about future goals and pathways is another hurdle\. When your life is in constant flux\, it’s hard to chart a course forward\. Ambition requires direction\, and without it\, you may find yourself drifting without purpose\. Clarity is key\, and seeking guidance from mentors or peers can help you stay on track \.

Cognitive load from constant resettlement is a hidden burden\. Every new city\, every new language\, every new culture adds to the mental fatigue\. The brain has limits\, and pushing past them can lead to burnout\. Recognizing when to slow down and recharge is crucial for sustaining this lifestyle over the long term \.

Stress from adapting to new environments is a recurring theme\. Whether it’s navigating bureaucracy\, dealing with language barriers\, or adjusting to different work ethics\, the process is draining\. It’s easy to romanticize the idea of adventure\, but the reality is often far more demanding\. Preparing yourself mentally for these challenges is essential for survival \.

Weighing the pros and cons of a digital nomadic life is a deeply personal decision\. It’s not for everyone\, and that’s okay\. Some thrive in this lifestyle\, while others find it unsustainable\. The key is to understand what you’re signing up for and whether it aligns with your values\, goals\, and personality\. There’s no one\-size\-fits\-all answer\, and the best choice is the one that serves your unique journey \.

Making an informed decision for your unique journey requires honesty and self\-reflection\. Ask yourself what you truly want from life and whether the nomadic path will help you achieve it\. Don’t be swayed by social media or the stories of others\. Your definition of success is yours alone to create\, and sometimes\, the most powerful step is choosing a different road altogether \.

1l3wjys,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1l3wjys/caffeine_in_the_morning_ashwagandha_at_night_is/,Caffeine in the Morning & Ashwagandha at Night — Is This Combo Okay on SR?,"Hey brothers,

Just wanted to share a bit about my current SR journey and get some feedback on my routine.

I’m actively trying to improve my lifestyle. Keeping things simple but consistent — light workouts (mostly bodyweight and stretches), trying to eat clean (homemade food, less processed stuff), and staying away from obvious triggers. Mentally, I’m feeling more alert, though I still get urges that I’m learning to redirect.

Now, the question I have is about caffeine and ashwagandha.

I take black coffee either early morning or around midday. It helps me stay sharp, especially when I’m working or reading.

At night, I take ashwagandha powder with milk to calm down and help with sleep and stress management.


Is this a good combo for someone on semen retention? Or would it be better to eliminate caffeine completely for more mental clarity, better energy regulation, or even stronger results in SR?

Would really appreciate any personal experiences or advice around this. Trying to fine-tune things in a way that supports this journey holistically. 🙏

Thanks in advance. Much love and strength to all of you on this path.",5,1749122091.0,Semenretention,6,1.0,False
1l3wjsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l3wjsz/trip_report_an_extreme_day_trip_to_oslo_norway/,"Trip Report: An 'Extreme' Day Trip to Oslo, Norway","A few months ago I read an article on [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn7v5lr2186o) about extreme day tripping - which is essentially when you catch the first flight out to a city then, later the same day, catch the last flight back from a city. 

I had been interested in this concept for quite some time and so when I saw that Oslo had return tickets from London on the same day for £46, I simply had to book it! I was scheduled to arrive into Oslo Gardermoen Airport at 11.25 and depart at 22.20, giving me just under 11 hours to explore the city and get a good feel for it. 

Now usually I like to stay overnight in a city minimum and stay longer, but given that Norway is one of the most expensive countries in the world, where even a bunk bed in a dorm at a hostel will set you back £65, it was simply so much cheaper to just book the same day return. One lady I overheard in the queue for immigration said it cost her £200 for one night in a simple AirBnb... no thanks. 

Firstly, if you are doing the same day trip as me, I would recommend getting the Oslo Pass, it cost me 550 NOK (Norwegian Krona, approx. £40.42) which gives you free transport on all public transport within Oslo's 4 travel zones, including the airport (but *not* the Flytoget express train), ferries, trams, and buses. It also grants free access to a large number of museums and attractions!

Oslo Gardermoen is the closest to the city of the two Oslo Airport's (TORP is a two hour coach ride away). You can take the 'Flytoget' express train however it costs £18.42 one way for a 19 minute journey and, as mentioned above, is not included in the Oslo Pass. The local 'Vy' train takes a few minutes longer but is included with the Oslo Pass. Even without the Oslo Pass, it costs 129 NOK (£9.42), half the price of the express which is only a few minutes faster. This is something to remember as tourists into the city are encouraged to take and all the advertising in the airport seems to suggest it is the only way to get into Oslo. 

Given the joys of being a British passport holder in 2025 it took a little while to get through immigration (and a border guard who was extremely suspicious of my travel plans and was utterly bemused at the fact I wouldn't even spend one night there), I managed to get into the city at around midday, one hour after the flight landed.

My first stop was Aker Brygge, a thriving social hub by Oslo's Ferry Port which had a number of restaurants, cafes, and bars. It seemed all of Oslo's business men and women were out for their lunches at this time but I managed to find a quiet spot at Supreme Roastworks, a cool little cafe that served a good coffee and pastry and they even had a Porsche sat in the middle of the cafe! Probably one of the most unique cafes I've been to. Friendly staff, good coffee, and a Porsche what more do you need?

From here I headed down to Pier F and went on the Bygdoy Ferry that takes you to Bygdoy Peninsula, where a number of museums are, including Fram Museum, Kon-Tiki Museum, and Viking Ship Museum (currently closed but due to open again soon) to name a few. This ferry is, once again, *included* in the Oslo Pass but not in any day ticket you might hold for Oslo Public transport and would cost you an additional 75 NOK (£5.48) one way or 115 NOK (£8.41) for a day ticket. The ferry takes 15 minutes and stops right outside the Fram Museum, which was my next destination. 

The Fram Museum was awesome! Within the museum is the original Fram ship, which is (I think) the largest wooden ship ever(?)! It was used on a number of multi-year expeditions inculding to the North and South Poles. It was incredibly unique and I loved seeing how early explorers and travellers used to travel the globe. It was, to me, a bit of an homage and pilgrimage for all the adventurers out there and makes being crammed on a Ryanair flight look a whole lot more glamorous. 

After the Fram Museum, I caught the Bygdoy Ferry back to Aker Brygge and headed up to Oslo Street Food Hall, as I was getting a bit ravenous. It's a decent place to eat on a budget and I had a large Orange Chicken and rice for 195NOK (£14.33). This is fairly cheap for Oslo standards but it was a hefty meal and filled me up for the rest of the day. 

I wandered down to the cathedral to see the Iron Roses Memorial in honour of those who died in the 2011 terror attacks in the city. It was then at the cathedral where I had one of my favourite travel experiences to date, where the cathedral had closed but I was invited in to watch a local organ player perform a recital! For the next hour I enjoyed listening to this man play the organ with a number of others and felt culturally enriched by the experience. I didn't think I could enjoy the organ being played so much, but I did and it just goes to show to keep your mind open to all new experiences, as you never know what you might find and enjoy. 

During the performance, I garnered a bit of a sweet tooth so felt the time was right to head to Harald's Vaffel, which I had heard plenty about. This was definitely the right choice and I highly recommend for anyone going to Oslo - I tried the traditional jam, sour cream, and Norwegian brown cheese waffle and I can confirm it was stupendously delicious. The lady even made an extra waffle by mistake and gave me a plain one for free after, which was very kind of her. This set me back 106 NOK (£7.79) including a bottle of water. Not bad at all. 

I wound down my trip by visiting the Opera House which I had heard so much about. You can walk to the roof and it is worth visiting for the views alone but I didn't go inside so can't comment on that. 

I found a local bar called Kulturhuset (Culture House) where I relaxed and wrote in my diary before heading back to the airport for my flight home. 

So, what are my thoughts on 'extreme' day tripping? Really good - especially for expensive destinations like Oslo where accommodation can easily double or triple your budget. With good research, I found what I wanted to do before I went there and ruled out what I didn't want to see early on, whereas sometimes when I travel to places without having done research, a lot of time is wasted trying to find somewhere that I enjoy/like. It made me a lot more purposeful with my trip. There were a few more things I would have liked to see (e.g. Munch Museum, Nobel Peace Centre, National Museum) but these were secondary. 

There were quite a few people on the return flight back who had done the exact same as me and visited Oslo on a day trip - one friend group, one mum and her kids, one couple, one other solo traveller that I saw, so definitely not a majority. There is, understandbly, concerns about the environmental impact and 'carbon footprint' of this kind of trip however these flights would have gone ahead with or without my booking. 

I'd still prefer to stay overnight as the day is quite long and I was tired by the end of it. This approach would make more sense where accommodation is significantly cheaper and I still prefer to travel that way. Let me know your thoughts - have you done this before? Did you enjoy it?

It looked compact, had a decent price tag, and the specs read like it was “just enough.” But after giving it a spin for a few weeks, I gotta admit—it’s surprisingly capable for a budget machine. Here’s my no-fluff, tried-and-tested review.

# First Impressions

The machine feels sturdy and has a clean, no-fuss design. It doesn’t scream premium, but it doesn’t feel cheap either. If you’re short on counter space, it fits in easily without hogging room.

# Coffee Quality

The espresso this machine brews is pretty solid. It doesn’t hit barista-level perfection, but it has:

* **Good crema**
* **Strong flavor extraction**
* **Minimal bitterness** (if you use the right grind)

What blew me away a little? It delivers **20 bar pressure**, which is wild for something at this price point.

# Steam Wand

Okay, let’s talk froth. The steam wand gets the job done for basic lattes and cappuccinos. It’s not as powerful as higher-end models, but it gives you decent microfoam with a little patience.

Perfect for people who like experimenting but aren’t trying to become a latte art champ.

# Ease of Use & Cleaning

Super beginner-friendly. Easy buttons, no weird sequences. You plug it in, wait for it to heat up (pretty fast, btw), and go.

The **water tank is detachable** and cleaning is straightforward—major win for daily usability.

# Should You Buy It?

If you're looking for:

* A starter espresso machine that actually works
* A budget-friendly way to enjoy coffee shop vibes at home
* Something compact that won’t eat up counter space

...then this is a great pick.

Check it out and see if it suits your vibe:

## Key Features Analysis

The undercounter ice makers of 2025 boast cutting-edge features that enhance their performance, convenience, and durability.

**Production Capacity:** The standout feature of the top undercounter ice makers is their notable ice production capacity. Models like the Scotsman CU2026MA and the Manitowoc UDD0310A are projected to produce between 20 and 30 pounds of ice per day. This ensures a consistent supply for entertaining, catering, or simply enjoying refreshing beverages. This high output minimizes the need for frequent manual ice filling.

**Ice Shape and Type:** Many advanced undercounter ice makers offer versatility in ice shape and type.The Hoshizaki AM-50BAJ-AD, for example, is expected to continue offering its signature top hat-shaped ice, known for its slow-melting properties. Other models are anticipated to offer cube, crescent, or nugget ice options. This allows users to select the ice type that best suits their preferences and needs. This customization enhances the overall user experience.

**Storage Capacity:** Another crucial feature is the storage capacity of the ice bin. Top-rated models typically offer a storage capacity ranging from 20 to 25 pounds. The Whirlpool WUI115S is expected to maintain its position as a leader in this category. A larger storage capacity reduces the frequency of ice harvesting and provides a reserve during peak demand periods. This reduces potential inconvenience.

**Water Filtration System:** Integrated water filtration systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in undercounter ice makers. These systems remove impurities,chlorine,and other contaminants from the water source,resulting in cleaner,clearer,and better-tasting ice.The clear ice enhances the aesthetic appeal of beverages. Internal filters also safeguards the machine from mineral buildup, extending its lifespan and reducing maintenance requirements. Users will appreciate the convenience and quality of the resulting ice.

**Energy Efficiency:** with growing environmental awareness, energy efficiency is a key consideration for consumers. Leading undercounter ice maker models are designed with energy-saving features such as insulated cabinets, low-energy compressors, and automatic shut-off mechanisms.these features minimize energy consumption and reduce operating costs, making them an eco-friendly and budget-conscious choice. This also helps users reduce their carbon footprint.

**smart Features and Connectivity:** Many of the 2025 undercounter ice makers are expected to incorporate smart features and connectivity options. These may include smartphone app control, remote monitoring, and alerts for maintenance or low ice levels. These advanced features provide greater convenience and control over the ice-making process. Some models may even integrate with smart home systems for seamless automation.

**How often do undercounter ice makers need to be cleaned?**

This one’s not your basic push-button brewer. It’s for people who **actually enjoy dialing in** their shot—tweaking the pressure, adjusting the temperature, and messing with the grind till they get the perfect crema.

# What Made Me Pick This Model?

I was looking for something under ₹8,000 that didn’t feel plasticky or dumbed down. The VANTRO’s **20-bar pressure, adjustable temp settings, and full stainless steel finish** had me sold. It looked and felt solid—and not like those gimmicky budget espresso machines that scream “Instagram aesthetic, zero power.”

# Real-Life Performance: Here's the Good, the Great & the ""Huh""

**1. Shot Quality**

If you’ve got freshly ground beans and a halfway decent tamper, this thing pulls a legit shot. I’ve tested both single and double shots, and it handles them well without choking. The extraction is **surprisingly consistent**, and yes—it does create that **golden-brown crema** we all chase.

**2. Temperature Control**

There’s a manual knob to control temp and steam, which is actually amazing. Once you figure out your sweet spot, it’s super easy to **maintain temperature stability**, especially if you're someone who drinks 2-3 cups in one go.

**3. Frother Wand**

The frother is powerful. Like, froths milk in 30–40 seconds kind of powerful. It does get hot, though—so you gotta practice a bit to avoid over-steaming. But for cappuccino lovers, this wand’s got your back.

# Build Quality & Features I Didn't Expect

* **Solid Stainless Steel Body** – Doesn’t look or feel cheap. This one will **last longer than a Diwali sale**.
* **Digital Display + Manual Knob Combo** – I liked this mix. The LED shows pressure and heat, while the manual knobs give you more physical control.
* **1.5L Detachable Water Tank** – Easy to refill and clean. Honestly, a lifesaver when you’re lazy post-coffee.

# A Few Things That Could Be Better

* **Takes Practice** – This isn’t for total newbies. You’ll need a few tries to get the right combo of grind, tamp, and brew time.
* **No Built-in Grinder** – You’ll need a separate grinder for fresh beans.
* **Bit Loud During Extraction** – Not crazy loud, but not whisper-quiet either.

# Verdict: Should You Buy It?

If you want full control over your espresso game without spending ₹30,000+, this machine **hits the sweet spot**. It’s not plug-and-play, but that’s what makes it fun if you enjoy experimenting. I’d totally recommend it to someone who’s **past the beginner stage** and ready to take brewing seriously at home.

I’ve noticed I’m doing all sorts of mental gymnastics to justify this splurge since it goes against my frugal principles. I keep telling myself it saves money on café trips in the long run (even though I barely went out for coffee to begin with), and that the fancy lattes really do taste like those $5 café ones. Truth is, I just thought it was too cool to pass up!

That's just plain ol’ cognitive dissonance doing its thing. It's when you’ve got two conflicting beliefs—like wanting to be frugal vs. buying a pricey gadget—and your brain tries real hard to convince you your decision wasn’t a bad move. We justify, rationalize, and kinda rewrite the story to make ourselves feel better.

What happened to actually *having fun*?","Lately, I’ve grown increasingly frustrated with how my friends choose where to hang out. It’s no longer about having a good time, trying new things, or even enjoying good food — it’s all about whether the place looks “aesthetic” enough for Instagram. Every weekend now revolves around cafes with neon signs, overpriced iced teas, and posing for photos that half of us don’t even post.

Just recently, a friend came to visit Bangalore. I was genuinely excited and suggested we go Go-karting or grab some amazing Desi Chinese from a stall I know — proper nostalgic, flavorful food and actual fun. He flat-out refused. Instead, we ended up doing the typical “Instagram Bangalore tour”: Church Street, cafes, more cafes, and coffee after coffee after coffee. The entire day was just walking through crowded streets, taking half-hearted photos, and sipping on mediocre beverages. That was it.

I ended up spending 2k on what felt like a staged photoshoot with no actual substance. Zero fun, zero excitement. Just vibes and filters.

I miss the old days when plans meant laughter, adrenaline, good food, and spontaneous fun — not curating a reel. Why does everything have to be for social media now? When did *looking* like you're having fun become more important than actually *having* it?

I’ve been on the carnivore diet for 7 months now. I have ankylosing spondylitis, and when I first started the diet, I saw almost immediate improvements. Within just a few days, my inflammation dropped significantly—no more morning stiffness. Over the next few months, my painful sacroiliitis and swollen knees gradually disappeared.

But around month 4, I started experiencing intense pain in my ankles, toes, and even swelling in my Achilles tendon. It really feels like gout symptoms—sharp pain, swelling, and stiffness in the small joints.

I started alkalizing my urine with lemon water, potassium citrate, and apple cider vinegar. I also significantly lowered my protein intake, thinking it might help.

I've had massive personal growth and my skills in helping men break free from porn have never been sharper. I'm clearer than ever about what coaching can accomplish versus what requires therapy.

But my physical health is suffering. I've been hospitalized twice this month for diverticulitis, and stress is the primary driver. 

**My body is forcing me to practice what I preach about taking care of the fundamentals.**

Before I go, a few things I want you to hear:

Your thoughts are the root of everything. Every urge, every shame spiral, every ""screw it"" moment starts in your head. If you don't learn how to manage your mind, nothing else will stick.

You might not know how to look at your thoughts because no one ever really showed you. 

Unless you've been trained in it, you don't even know what you don't know. 

Cognitive behavioral therapy is, in my opinion, the best thing in the world for this. This is the root of mindset work. 

So study that and get a mentor or coach or therapist. 

**When you're in the water mentally, you don't even know you're in the water.**

That can help you, but it doesn't solve everything. If you've suffered any kind of trauma and most people have, deeper work with therapy is the real solution.

Taking myself as a prime example: I've stopped using porn, I've stopped smoking weed, I gave up alcohol, and I even recently stopped drinking coffee, all through managing my thoughts. 

**I find that absolutely amazing**, but the underlying stress caused by trauma isn't fixed. I can manage my thoughts and that helps me, but it's not treating the core issues.

In all the issues I've faced recently there have been no urges or desire to watch porn. Once in a great while I think about it but I start laughing because its almost ridiculous to me now that I would do that.  
  
**That is a testament to how much things can change when your mindset / beliefs change.**

Second, sleep. This isn't optional. Your brain can't reset or recover if you're up late scrolling and beating yourself up. 

If you want to heal, start by getting some damn rest. 

I naturally gave up coffee because I just don't need it anymore, and I will let nothing come between me and healthy sleep. 

If I think I need coffee, it means I'm not rested enough. 

Quitting It wasn't a fight, there were no urges other than missing a cold ice coffee on a hot day but I can manage that.

And finally, stop chasing hacks. Dopamine detoxes, blocking apps, habit trackers etc, **they're Band-Aids**.   


You don't need more tools. **You need to deal with what's** ***underneath*** **the porn. That's the real work.**

I'm not stopping coaching, it'll always be my passion. But I'm stepping back from creating posts and answering questions on Reddit. I need to focus on my health and other priorities right now.

I'm still taking a limited number of clients and always will. That's a deep passion of mine that keeps me sharp and helps me just as much as it helps them. But I'm going to be focusing primarily on high-functioning men who don't have significant trauma issues.

Ever stumble across a strange-looking machine at your local gas station or convenience store and realize—*wait a second, that’s a Bitcoin ATM*? Yep, they’re real. They’re here. And they’re quietly revolutionizing how people get their hands on digital gold—without the fuss of online exchanges or complicated bank verifications.

Bitcoin ATMs (a.k.a. BTMs) are like the vending machines of the future. But instead of spitting out soda or snacks, they feed your digital wallet with BTC. Some even let you *cash out* your Bitcoin into real-world money. It's like an arcade token machine for the crypto age—except the tokens might go to the moon.

But here’s the catch: using a Bitcoin ATM can feel a little intimidating if you're new to the scene. That's where **our handy little tool comes in**:  
🎯 [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)

# What’s a Bitcoin ATM Actually Do?

At its core, a Bitcoin ATM allows you to:

* **Buy Bitcoin with cash** (insert bills like it’s 2005)
* **Send Bitcoin to a wallet address** (no need for bank accounts)
* Sometimes even **sell Bitcoin and withdraw cash**

Think of it like a crypto portal. Step up, scan a QR code, insert your fiat, and *poof*—you're a Bitcoiner.

# Wait—Scan a What Now?

This is where a lot of folks freeze up. The machine says *""scan your wallet QR code""* and you’re like... *what wallet? what code? am I in a heist movie?*

Breathe easy. That’s why we built [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) — your one-stop, zero-hassle Bitcoin QR code generator.

Just enter your Bitcoin address, choose a style (yes, we made them look cool), and boom—you’ve got a ready-to-scan QR code image that you can save, print, or tattoo on your forearm (okay maybe not that last one, but we won’t stop you).

# Why It’s So Useful

* **Speed**: When you're standing at a Bitcoin ATM, every second counts. No one wants to fumble around typing out a 42-character address like they’re decoding an alien transmission.
* **Accuracy**: QR codes eliminate typos. One wrong character = lost coins. Our generator ensures your Bitcoin gets to the right wallet, every time.
* **Custom Branding**: If you're a business, you can even stylize your QR code to match your vibe. Accept Bitcoin tips at your coffee shop? Boom. Custom QR code by the register.

# Real Talk: Bitcoin Is Getting More Accessible

Gone are the days when buying Bitcoin felt like some hacker-level quest. With thousands of Bitcoin ATMs around the world and tools like [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), it’s easier than ever to step into the future of finance.

So next time you see one of those mysterious orange kiosks blinking at you in the corner of a store, don’t walk past it like it’s an alien artifact. Whip out your phone, scan your custom QR code, and buy yourself a piece of the decentralized dream.

Because in this wild world of finance, sometimes all you need is a QR code and a few bucks to join the revolution.

1l3w4up,https://i.redd.it/5dsgmmql935f1.jpeg,The case of the missing sock! Poltergeist?,"Hi,

Something very strange happened to my family over the weekend and I'm keen for anyone who's got any experience of this to tell me what an earth might be going on?!

We'd gone to stay up at my MIL house. Over the years the house has had strange things going on, lamps turning on and off, carbon monoxide alarm going off in the middle of the night for no reason, items disappearing and then reappearing moments later. I always had nightmares most of the time when I was there etc. The children said they saw a model of an old wooden clown moving around etc. Anyway, I spoke to a friend of mine and she said that it was stuck energy and she would move it on if i gave her the address. I did this and for all intents and purposes it seemed to work, all activity ceased.

We went up this last weekend to stay there and on Sunday morning I gave my son a pair of bunched up socks to put on, along with the rest of his clothes, when I came back downstairs he said he only had one of the socks and the other was missing. I thought well it'll turn up somewhere, told him to take the sock off he was wearing and gave him another pair to wear. We locked up the house as we were returning to our family home. I told my husband and son that i would walk down and get a coffee and meet them on the beach later, so they got in the car and drove 5 minutes to the dog beach to let the dog have a run around. When i walked to meet them 15 minutes later my son said 'oh mummy guess what we've found, my missing sock'. They'd got the dog out the car, put him on a lead and walked towards the beach, where upon they came across the sock lying flat on the sea wall! The sock was dry, hadnt been out there long and smelt clean of washing powder...if it was a plain coloured sock I wouldnt have thought anything of it but in this case my sons sock had a specific design on it and it was exactly the same one.

Now..this is where it gets weirder. For some UNKNOWN reason to us we picked the sock up and decided to take it home with us...to this day I have no idea why we did this! My husband puts it in a plastic bag inside the car, we drive home. Later that afternoon I'm unpacking and I come down and show my husband the original sock that I packed in the suitcase earlier that morning and said 'feeling a bit funny about that other sock, can you not bring it into the house' so he goes outside to burn it. As hes walking outside he notices the sock is now not in a plastic bag inside the car...but lying flat on the driveway. He said he would have noticed it as he was going back and forth to the car to unpack. Anyway he burns both socks and that was that.

Later that night I was unpacking rest of suitcase and put 2 golf balls ontop of a chest of drawers in my bedroom. I made sure at the time they were nestled nicely into a grey thick knit jumper and as far at the back of the chest so there wouldnt be any chance of them accidently rolling off. I woke up the following morning to find the golf balls placed neatly next to one another, on the floor within direct eyeline of where I was sleeping. I tried and my husband tried to replicate them falling off and rolling into that position and we couldn't. Even the angle of where they are placed is off to where they were located ontop of the chest of drawers. See photo for reference. Furthermore, I don't know what would have caused a heavy chest of drawers to judder in order to allow them to roll off in the first place. Anyway, carried on the morning and around mid morning I'm taking laundry from a basket and hanging up towels in the bathroom off of the bedroom. I put 2 purple laundry balls in the basket, I know that I put them in there because I remember thinking at the time, right, I'll put these in here and take them back downstairs. I turned my back to put the towels on the towel rack in the bathroom, turned back around to go back out to the basket on the bed in the bedroom...and one of the laundry balls was now on the floor, again immedietly within my eyeline.

At this point my husband is on the phone to a priest, who comes over, blesses us and the house and since then no other activity has taken place. My husband is getting confirmed in the church on Thursday so we're wondering if its related to that.

Having a Bsc and working in engineering field i have tried to think logically about what would have caused this. Could the dog have picked up the sock from the house and carried to the beach, my husband said no because he was on a lead the moment he got out the car and found the sock along with them. The other suggestion was a magpie picking up the sock and dropping it but my son didnt go outside. We also have camera footage front and back of house and saw no one entering or leaving the house after us. The golf balls, I could have slept walked and done it and the laundry ball maybe it was a lapse of judgement but I am 99.9% certain I put them in the laundry basket to take back downstairs!

If anyone has any explanation or experience of this please comment. We're all a bit shook up by it.",1,1749120618.0,Unexplained,0,1.0,False

Love it when a new business opens and feel we need to support this one massively in our community to KEEP IT OPEN! Visited this new start-up yesterday as was hearing good things and WOW. Putting it out on all my socials to spread the word! Tom's (the owner) cheesecake pots where unlike any cheesecake i'd tasted before!! He had a full spread of good looking treats and does coffee aswell! Savoury stuff he said is coming soon also but he's been there for only 3 weeks! Little hidden gem.

Get down there Wed-Sun they're open. 11AM till Sell Out - which has been the case most days he said!

***(Tom did tell me their opening times are a little different this weekend - 9-1 on Sat and opening back up at 1-6 on Sun! - Just this weekend though)***

Also, Sticky Toffee pudding is apparently their Sunday Special so I'll be bagging one of them Sunday 😂😋 anyway, we always need to support small businesses and why not have the best cheesecake of your life whilst at it 🤣

***P.S. 🤣 Seems some commenters think I am Tom. Or a son of Tom. 

I am not. I am a Wavertree resident only about 10 minutes from the bakery and wanted to spread awareness for an independant that has recently opened - that I stumbled across on a walk and had a chat with the owner ***",19,1749120552.0,Liverpool,15,0.89,False

1l3w3vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_VegetableOld9315/comments/1l3w3vb/looking_for_affordable_travel_sea_to_amd_flights/,Looking for Affordable Travel? SEA to AMD Flights Offer the Best Deals,"More than a simple itinerary, [**SEA to AMD Flights**](https://flydealfare.com/airfare/seattle-to-ahmedabad-flights/) represent a journey between innovation and heritage, connecting Seattle’s forward-thinking pulse with Ahmedabad’s timeless traditions. For travelers seeking depth over distance, this route offers more than just convenience; it offers contrast, character, and cultural immersion. Whether you’re returning to your roots or uncovering new destinations, this flight path is increasingly favored by those who value both purpose and discovery in their travels.



**Why Ahmedabad?**



Ahmedabad, located in the heart of Gujarat, is not just an industrial hub—it’s a city where ancient traditions and modern aspirations meet. Declared India’s first UNESCO World Heritage City, Ahmedabad offers visitors an immersive experience in Indian culture. From architectural marvels like the Sidi Saiyyed Mosque to bustling street food scenes at Manek Chowk, this city welcomes travelers with open arms.



For tech professionals, business owners, and students traveling from the U.S., Ahmedabad is increasingly becoming a preferred destination. The city’s well-developed infrastructure, educational institutions, and connectivity make it a vital node on the map for travelers booking flights from Seattle to Ahmedabad.



**The Journey from SEA to AMD**



Flying from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (SEA) to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport (AMD) is a long yet rewarding journey. While there are currently no direct SEA to AMD flights, many top international carriers offer one or two-stop options with efficient layovers in major hubs like Dubai, Doha, Frankfurt, or London. These connections allow for a smooth transition across continents with reliable schedules and quality in-flight services.



It’s not uncommon for flyers to worry about fatigue or extended travel times, especially on such long-distance routes. However, planning wisely—such as choosing flights with shorter layovers and reputable airlines—can turn this marathon into a seamless journey. For families, flexible itineraries and kid-friendly airlines add a touch of convenience, while solo travelers may enjoy the chance to explore world-class airports during transit.



**Finding Cheap Flights from Seattle to Ahmedabad**



Let’s face it—international travel isn’t always budget-friendly. But the good news is that with some flexibility in travel dates and a little advanced planning, you can find cheap flights from Seattle to Ahmedabad without sacrificing comfort. Mid-week departures and booking several weeks ahead tend to offer the best deals. Additionally, flying during shoulder seasons—spring and fall—can unlock significant savings and a more pleasant travel experience.



To maximize your budget, consider flying during India’s off-peak travel months. This not only reduces costs but also means fewer crowds when you arrive in Ahmedabad. Keep in mind that while some deals might appear too good to be true, doing a little research on layover durations and baggage policies can ensure a hassle-free trip.



**Hidden Perks of the Route**



What makes flights from SEA to AMD unique is the opportunity to experience a diverse set of cultures in a single journey. One might sip on locally brewed coffee in Seattle in the morning and enjoy a steaming plate of Gujarati dhokla the next day in Ahmedabad. The transition from the Pacific Northwest's evergreen landscapes to India’s arid plains and bustling city streets is not just geographical—it’s emotional and cultural.



The passengers who regularly travel between India and the United States often express this sentiment: Returning home to Ahmedabad is coming back home, especially for the Indian diaspora. For someone coming here for the first time, the warmth, color, and hospitality this city offers make for a never-to-be-forgotten welcome.



**The Travel Tips for a Smooth Flight Experience**



While booking flights from Seattle to Ahmedabad, some of these important tips may assist you through the journey:



It's always vital to stay hydrated during long-haul flights. Carry a refillable water bottle and drink whenever you feel thirsty throughout the trip.



Pack light but smart if you intend to go around India soon after you land.



Consider travel insurance: a minor amount you pay can save you from a headache should your itinerary be changed or your luggage be misplaced.



Join the loyalty programs of airlines. For frequent flyers, collecting miles leads to free upgrades and discounts one day.



Early bookings during the festive seasons of Diwali or Navratri also secure you the best seats and prices, as these days usually become popular for visiting holidays to family in India.



**Connecting Cultures, One Flight at a Time**



International travel is always a special thing where two very different cultures meet. From Seattle with its Space Needle-dominated skyline to Ahmedabad with the majestic Sabarmati Ashram, these two cities speak of innovation and heritage, respectively. [India tickets](https://flydealfare.com/) mean savings plus enriching experiences for anybody traveling for business, family, or personal exploration.



SEA to AMD flights are more than travel bookings- they serve family connections, professional bridges, or stir wanderlust. And it is rapidly becoming a preferred route for the Indian-American community, students, and professionals relocating temporarily or permanently.



**Final Thoughts**



Maybe as a seasoned traveler or someone having an appointment for his first international flight, flights from Seattle to Ahmedabad provide the unique opportunity to journey from the rain-washed, forested beauty of Washington to the bright, sunny streets of Gujarat. Inexpensive, accessible, and increasingly reliable, these SEA to AMD flights will lead you to the real India.



With travel becoming more conducive and choices for cheap flights from Seattle to Ahmedabad only increasing, it is perhaps the perfect time to pack your bags and embark on this transcontinental trek. With a bit of preparation and some Will to explore, your next flight from Seattle to Ahmedabad will prove to be as enjoyable...



So if you're planning your next big trip, consider leaping—[flights to India](https://flydealfare.com/flights-to-india/) have never been more inviting.

[$150],"Peugeot grinders are pretty big in the salt and pepper mill game and they also sell coffee grinders. You can find very many vintage grinders from them on the used market, but it seems like this brand is forgotten in the third wave coffee world.

They still sell some models and I am wondering if anyone has ever tested them.

They also come with 25 years warranty on the burrs. So they are still confident with their products and compared to known espresso hand grinders they are also pretty competetive on the price.

1l3w1jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1l3w1jk/insead_essay_tips_20252026/,INSEAD essay tips - 2025-2026,"Hello, I hope I am welcome to post these here given the association between INSEAD & consulting.

**What’s important to keep in mind is INSEAD’s 4 criteria, their rubric for evaluating you. These should be felt in the various application components.**

1 - academic capacity (transcripts, scores)

2 - leadership potential (chiefly this means taking the initiative to solve problems that make an organizational impact, but people management can also be part of this)

3 - ability to contribute - bringing something unique/additive to the class, having a pay-it-forward mentality (keep in mind they have 2 alums interview each candidate!)

4 - international motivation - openness and also goals/need/motivation for a UN-style program

***Question 1: Job Description/Career Trajectory ""Provide a summary of your career since graduating from university, explaining the rationale behind your key decisions and career progression. Include a description of your current (or most recent) role, covering the scope of your work, major responsibilities, employees under your supervision, budget size, clients/products, and any notable results achieved."" (500 words maximum)***

This is an on-paper “walk me through your resume” and your recommenders are asked a similar question. INSEAD is trying to get a sense of your career trajectory, but also, understand how you might answer the “walk me through your resume” question when interviewing with their recruiting companies.

What I often see is a “resume redux” which is a bit of a missed opportunity. You want to focus on your “why” –  this is especially advantageous if there is a specific passion or purpose behind your choices, a throughline. A higher overarching purpose.

This question also sets the perfect context for the next question on your goals. Once they have the TLDR version of where you have been, and where you are now, they can see if your goal sounds achievable. And if they can help you with the gaps you hope to fill at INSEAD to position yourself for success.

***Question 2: Goals + Why INSEAD ""Describe your short- and long-term career aspirations, including your target geography, industry, and function. How do you plan to bridge the gap between your current position and these goals, and how will INSEAD help you achieve them?"" (300 words maximum)***

Work experience + INSEAD = short term goal + experience = long term goal

Your goal should be within reach, where it’s clear that you can reach it with the requisite effort and that INSEAD adds value.

In the current environment, you might want to be more conservative on-paper. Even if you have a finance background, you might pick going to work for a portfolio company vs. VC, making VC the long-term goal.

If you’re a consultant, PE might be possible post-MBA in some geographies, but it might be wise to state IB as your goal (if you are going for January intake, of course.)

If you want to crack MBB, or T2, it’s important to show you have done enough research to know what you bring to the position and also what you’re up against. What qualities will help you pass behaviorals? Have you tried solving a case? How are your modeling skills?

Speak confidently but candidly - and specify how the resources at INSEAD will fill the gaps. If you can manage to fit it, speak to interactions you had with alums or at events to substantiate your statements about what INSEAD offers.

***Question 3: Strengths & Weaknesses ""Give a candid description of yourself as a person and a leader, emphasising the strengths and weaknesses you recognise in yourself. Explain how you are actively working on your development, sharing key experiences that have shaped you, providing specific examples where relevant."" (500 words maximum)***

It's interesting they have now added “and a leader” and “actively working on your development” to this already ambitious prompt. I imagine they wanted to give applicants another opportunity to demonstrate leadership - one of their four criteria - beyond the resumes and recommendations. Also, it seems they might be trying to protect the student experience by sifting out those afflicted with narcissistic personality disorder, who don’t believe they *have* any flaws or need to develop themselves.

I think the best approach here would be to share one or two experiences that have shaped your strengths, one as a person, and one as a leader. Then, share one or two experiences where you became aware/made to face your weaknesses. Share the efforts you’ve made to work on one or more of these weaknesses. Ideally one of these weaknesses might speak to the “gaps” you hope to work on at INSEAD.

I wouldn’t recommend turning this into another letter of recommendation but rather touching on more universal themes (with specific examples, however) so they can get a 360-degree perspective on who you are.

***Question 4: Stressful Situation ""Describe a highly stressful situation you faced and how you managed it. What did this experience teach you about yourself and your interactions with others?"" (400 words maximum)***

Would recommend you use CARR format for this: challenge, action, result, reflection.

What they are seeking is self-awareness, humility, and capacity to adapt and grow.  One of my clients wrote about how he and his team had failed to do a deep-enough dive into the culture and presented a solution that went against the spiritual beliefs of the village they were trying to help.

Do not fear discussing similar setbacks. Often, I find applicants are very preoccupied with putting forth a strong face, but this creates a barrier to admissions trusting you or feeling a connection with you. If you only show strengths and successes they won’t feel they are getting to know you, which is the only reason they are reading all this stuff anyways.

Facing challenges and learning from setbacks is what shows leadership, and what makes your application relatable and interesting. It also shows maturity, coachability, and readiness to gain what INSEAD could give you.

***Question 5 –  Activities***

***""Describe the activities you listed above and explain how they have enriched your life (e.g., skills developed, personal growth, community impact)."" (300 words maximum)***  

So, the CV, recommendations, and job essays all speak to your professional life, and this is your chance to show how you have achieved impact outside of work.

INSEAD is an especially social program, and they want to know you would be a social value-add. You want to present yourself as well-rounded and multidimensional, someone who can talk about things other than work with your fellow INSEADers. In sum, interesting.

While they do speak about community impact, I encourage you to include the hard-hitting numbers in your CV and use this section to speak from the heart on how various activities have shaped your values and enlivened you. Switch gears here and take a softer and warmer approach that helps them get to know you as a person.

So commonly I see dinged applications where the candidate “made their case” in an almost defensive way, telegraphing arrogance or insecurity, rather than talking to admissions as you would a friend. This is what they mean when they say, “be yourself” or “don’t tell us what you think we want to hear.”

INSEAD says on their blog:

*Be original*

*We encourage you to stay away from clichés and to create original content. In other words, we want to get to know the real “you”, so be honest and reflect deeply on what unique experience you can bring to the programme. It may help you to think about what you would say to a friend or a sibling over coffee in response to each of the questions.*

It’s really a simple switch in mindset from trying to ""prove yourself"" to letting someone into your world, vulnerably yet confidently, knowing the little things that make you “you” are enough.

***Question 6 – Optional Essay***

***Optional Essay: Is there anything else that was not covered in your application that you would like to share with the Admissions Committee? ( 300 words)***

Optional essays come in 2 forms, either explanations for red flags or space to share more about yourself. Given there is no language here saying “please only share” or “do not consider this an additional essay” you have complete freedom.

Reflect on what you (and possibly your recommenders) have already shared and what you still need to illustrate in terms of their criteria of academic capacity, leadership, contribution and international motivation.

This looks a bit different for each person. If your GMAT quant score is low, but you tutor math or statistics to masters’ students, that might be a great way to show both academic capacity and contribution.

Usually, I recommend articulating how you intend to contribute at INSEAD in this essay because there is no specific place to include this elsewhere (the why INSEAD part is combined with goals, but the “why you” isn’t).

Think about what skills or areas of specialized knowledge you have, and how it might help others. For example, if you have a long work history with green energy, maybe you could do a workshop that might help sponsored consulting students get those kinds of projects returning to MBB.

This essay is an opportunity to showcase the research you have done on the program. Ask the head of the consulting club, VC club etc, what could be done better, what is missing there that I could help with?

INSEAD is looking for people who are community-builders who have a generous spirit. Having 2 alums interview you is a big commitment on their part, so you might want to speak about how you can contribute while you are there, but also beyond.

1l3w12a,https://i.redd.it/0fgagvhi835f1.jpeg,The case of the missing sock? Poltergeist?,"Hi, 

Something very strange happened to my family over the weekend and I'm keen for anyone who's got any experience of this to tell me what an earth might be going on?!

We'd gone to stay up at my MIL house. Over the years the house has had strange things going on, lamps turning on and off, carbon monoxide alarm going off in the middle of the night for no reason, items disappearing and then reappearing moments later. I always had nightmares most of the time when I was there etc. The children said they saw a model of an old wooden clown moving around etc. Anyway, I spoke to a friend of mine and she said that it was stuck energy and she would move it on if i gave her the address. I did this and for all intents and purposes it seemed to work, all activity ceased. 

We went up this last weekend to stay there and on Sunday morning I gave my son a pair of bunched up socks to put on, along with the rest of his clothes, when I came back downstairs he said he only had one of the socks and the other was missing. I thought well it'll turn up somewhere, told him to take the sock off he was wearing and gave him another pair to wear. We locked up the house as we were returning to our family home. I told my husband and son that i would walk down and get a coffee and meet them on the beach later, so they got in the car and drove 5 minutes to the dog beach to let the dog have a run around. When i walked to meet them 15 minutes later my son said 'oh mummy guess what we've found, my missing sock'. They'd got the dog out the car, put him on a lead and walked towards the beach, where upon they came across the sock lying flat on the sea wall! The sock was dry, hadnt been out there long and smelt clean of washing powder...if it was a plain coloured sock I wouldnt have thought anything of it but in this case my sons sock had a specific design on it and it was exactly the same one. 

Now..this is where it gets weirder. For some UNKNOWN reason to us we picked the sock up and decided to take it home with us...to this day I have no idea why we did this! My husband puts it in a plastic bag inside the car, we drive home. Later that afternoon I'm unpacking and I come down and show my husband the original sock that I packed in the suitcase earlier that morning and said 'feeling a bit funny about that other sock, can you not bring it into the house' so he goes outside to burn it. As hes walking outside he notices the sock is now not in a plastic bag inside the car...but lying flat on the driveway. He said he would have noticed it as he was going back and forth to the car to unpack. Anyway he burns both socks and that was that. 

Later that night I was unpacking rest of suitcase and put 2 golf balls ontop of a chest of drawers in my bedroom. I made sure at the time they were nestled nicely into a grey thick knit jumper and as far at the back of the chest so there wouldnt be any chance of them accidently rolling off. I woke up the following morning to find the golf balls placed neatly next to one another, on the floor within direct eyeline of where I was sleeping. I tried and my husband tried to replicate them falling off and rolling into that position and we couldn't. Even the angle of where they are placed is off to where they were located ontop of the chest of drawers. See photo for reference. Furthermore, I don't know what would have caused a heavy chest of drawers to judder in order to allow them to roll off in the first place. Anyway, carried on the morning and around mid morning I'm taking laundry from a basket and hanging up towels in the bathroom off of the bedroom. I put 2 purple laundry balls in the basket, I know that I put them in there because I remember thinking at the time, right, I'll put these in here and take them back downstairs. I turned my back to put the towels on the towel rack in the bathroom, turned back around to go back out to the basket on the bed in the bedroom...and one of the laundry balls was now on the floor, again immedietly within my eyeline. 

At this point my husband is on the phone to a priest, who comes over, blesses us and the house and since then no other activity has taken place. My husband is getting confirmed in the church on Thursday so we're wondering if its related to that. 

Having a Bsc and working in engineering field i have tried to think logically about what would have caused this. Could the dog have picked up the sock from the house and carried to the beach, my husband said no because he was on a lead the moment he got out the car and found the sock along with them. The other suggestion was a magpie picking up the sock and dropping it but my son didnt go outside. We also have camera footage front and back of house and saw no one entering or leaving the house after us. The golf balls, I could have slept walked and done it and the laundry ball maybe it was a lapse of judgement but I am 99.9% certain I put them in the laundry basket to take back downstairs! 

If anyone has any explanation or experience of this please comment. We're all a bit shook up by it. ",0,1749120251.0,Ghosts,3,0.25,False

The idea is super simple for one month, I don’t spend on anything outside of essentials (groceries, bills, gas, etc). No takeout, no clothes, no random online buys.

The first time I tried it, I failed halfway through because I forgot about a friend’s birthday dinner but even then, I saved around $150 just from being more aware. I used to think $10–$20 impulse buys weren’t a big deal, but when I stopped doing them for a bit, it really added up.

What’s helped is keeping a list of stuff I want during the month. I just write it down, and then revisit it later. 90% of the time, I don’t even care about it anymore. Like I’ll think I need something in the moment, and two weeks later it’s not even on my radar.

I don’t go super extreme like, I still get a coffee here and there if I really need a mental break. But overall, doing these no-buy resets has made me way more intentional with spending. And it weirdly feels good to say no to stuff I would’ve bought without thinking.

Anyone else tried this? Do you give yourself a small fun budget or go full cold turkey? I’m trying to make it more sustainable longterm, not just a onetime thing. Curious how others manage it.",85,1749120124.0,Frugal,16,0.99,False
1l3vzsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HonestBuyerReviews/comments/1l3vzsl/rossmann_coffee_maker_review_solid_performer_or/,Rossmann Coffee Maker Review: Solid Performer or All Hype?,"Let me just say this: if you're in your espresso girl/boy era, but your wallet still lives in reality.....this machine might just be *your* middle ground.

After spending a couple of weeks with the [Rossmann Coffee Maker](https://www.amazon.in/Rossmann-Espresso-Americano-Detachable-Frothing/dp/B0DG32QKXY?tag=rahulbhatia-21), here’s the full no-nonsense breakdown. I made my way through espressos, cappuccinos, americanos....and the occasional poorly-timed latte at 11PM.

# Let’s Talk Setup First

Out of the box, the setup is pretty straightforward. No scary manual, no 500-button mystery interface. The **LED touch screen** is surprisingly intuitive.

The **build feels sturdy**, with a nice matte black and silver combo. Doesn’t scream “budget” on the countertop....which I appreciate. The **1.5L water tank** is detachable, which sounds basic but is a serious blessing when you're rushing to refill before work.

# Performance: The Real Test

# 1350 Watts = Quick Heat Up

The heat-up time is quick. We're talking **under a minute** before you can start pulling shots. It uses the **20 Bar Italian Ulka Pump**, and yes—it **does produce legit crema** on your espresso, not that fake foam you see in knockoff machines.

# One Shot, Two Shot, No Problem

You get **single and double shot options**, and both are consistent. Once you dial in your grind (I used medium-fine), the output was bold but not bitter.

It can also make a pretty clean **Americano**, which was surprisingly smooth with zero sour notes.

# Cool Espresso Mode: Gimmick or Genius?

This is one of the features I thought I’d never use, but hey—it’s summer, and **cold espresso** became a thing in my house real quick. It doesn’t actually chill the coffee but allows for a cooler extraction that doesn’t burn your beans. Tastes fresh and light. Perfect for iced lattes.

# Frothing Wand: Real Talk

The frothing wand is *not professional-grade*, but **it gets the job done** if you learn the right angle and milk type. I used oat milk (because lactose doesn’t like me), and it created decent microfoam for cappuccinos and lattes. Could be stronger, but at this price? Totally fair.

# Cleaning It? Actually Doable

The drip tray and portafilter are easy to clean, and the machine doesn’t hold weird smells like some plasticky models. That **detachable water tank** also helps with drying out and avoiding mold (trust me, I’ve seen things...).

# Small Details That Add Up

* It doesn't shake violently while brewing (some do).
* It fits *taller mugs*, which is underrated.
* It's not too loud—won’t wake up your entire house.
* You’ll probably start drinking too much coffee. (Fair warning.)

# So... Worth It?

If you want **barista-style coffee without burning a hole in your pocket**, the Rossmann delivers solid value. It's ideal for someone who wants better-than-instant results and **has no time for fussy machines**.

Is it Breville-level? No. But it's not trying to be. It’s that in-between option that actually works—and it doesn’t disappoint.

# Want to Check the Latest Price on Amazon?

👉[ Here You Go](https://www.amazon.in/Rossmann-Espresso-Americano-Detachable-Frothing/dp/B0DG32QKXY?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

# Final Word

This is the kind of machine that **makes you look forward to mornings**. Not perfect, but **seriously satisfying**. And if you're starting out your home coffee journey—it’s a reliable first step.

I hope all of you are doing good. I am here to tell you about NIT Kurukshetra in this post. I'll try to cover most of the points, but feel free to ask anything in comments. Mods should feel free to reach out to me to verify my details.

# About Me

I have just graduated from NIT Kurukshetra this year in Computer Engineering. I had 45xx AIR in JEE Mains and 65xx in JEE Advanced in 2021, no reservation of any kind. I live within 50 km from NIT Kurukshetra, and that was one of the major deciding factor for me. I don't regret choosing NIT Kurukshetra...

# Placements

Let's start with what you all want to hear about! So, placements of NIT Kurukshetra went pretty good this year. Actually, previous year was a bit bad because of lack of TPO (Training and Placement Officer).

**Story behind poor placement in 2024 :** In Covid time, the then TPO left the job (I guess in 2020 or 2021, definitely before we came). And due to covid, new TPO could not be hired. So, they started looking for new TPO in 2022, when things were getting offline. And the new TPO could join only by June/July 2023. Now, since most of the companies needs to be contacted around this time, and TPO had to take some time to adjust, it was a bit of chaos. And in 2021 and 2022, student coordinators were handling the companies on their own. (Student coordinators are chosen by departments, generally highest CGPA candidate who applies is chosen). This lead to student coordinator taking short term steps to benefit themselves, which dented the college's reputation a bit. So, the reputation was already on its lowest in 2023, and TPO came a bit late. That's why there was a bit low placement of 2024 batch. And yeah -- the recession in job market.

But it was just 1 year, everything is fine now. Most of the companies are again coming, and by the time of placement of your batch, placements would be good again.

**This Year Placements major companies**

Major companies that visited, to best of my knowledge. Most of these are CS + IT companies, and ECE students are allowed in almost all. CS + IT strength would be roughly 400 students. Among these, around 70-100 of them were ineligible at least, mostly due to active backlog (reappear which is not passed on the date of placement drive)

|Company Name|Rough CTC ( base if I know ) LPA|Students Placed|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Google|63 (22)|10+ ( 5 on campus, 5+ off campus )|
|Microsoft|55 (15.5)|19 PPO ( there were around 45 interns, 17 on campus )|

|IBM ( Female only )|19(17)|3 On Campus|
|DE Shaw|\-|None|
|Amazon|I guess 40, base is 15|At least 6 intern, Off Campus, no proper data, PPO still rolling out|

Oracle, NAB, Infosys, United Airlines, IDBI Bank etc. also did visit, and had base salary of \~11LPA, hence, I did not mention them above. These are for CSE and IT ( and ECE is allowed in most of them )

So, you get the idea.

This year, the 6 months intern + FTE rule in 8th sem came in october, so many companies could not visit (including Apple, they were actually coming). Next year onwards, much much more companies will be visiting, but there is risk in 8th sem intern+performance based FTE because if you don't get PPO, you are basically unemployed after graduation. Most colleges include these students as FTE in stats and hence, number looks inflated.

So, the placements this year were pretty good.

# Location and Campus

Campus is really huge and beautiful, it is 300 acre for NIT + 473 acre for Kurukshetra University, which is adjacent to NIT. There is a wall with a gate between KUK and NIT, and there are 5-6 guards 24x7 there. There's no trespassing as such between NIT and KUK. So, you get to enjoy KUK facilities as well, like sports ground, without having much trouble. In fact we have quite good bonding with KUK guys, and play together in the evening (basketball).

Although, NIT Kurukshetra is located in Thanesar, which is like a bit outer side of Kurukshetra, yet all the facilities are available on campus. You have blinkit, zomato etc. services available.

**Facilities in Campus :** There is a market, with various shops, like general store, stationary store, medical store, juice shop, SBI Bank branch and ATM, barber, washing/dry cleaning shop, 1 small eatery and a Dominos! There's also a senate hall canteen, which serves decently good food at fairly cheap prices. Apart from these, there's a Moxie, that is again serving food/tea, but has much more variety. There's also a juice corner in front of library.

But all of these are open till 9pm-11pm only. If you want late night food, there's a lot of options there too. There's maggie hotspot near the boys hostel, that serves around 10 types of maggie, has nestle coffee machine, nestle chocolates, burgers and sandwiches etc. Another option is H6 shop, that has variety of packed food, like chips, kurkure, cold drink, biscuits etc and also maggie and paranthas. These open till 2pm.

If you are still not satified / want food at 3 am / want non veg, there's eateries just outside the main gate, that deliver food at backgate even till 3am ( I haven't tested after that, but they do deliver at 3 am ). You can order anything from them - they have fairly large menu and cheap prices.

**Sports :** Sports facilities are good. Sports complex is generally open till 9pm, and have good floodlights for late night matches. Sports complex is really well maintained.

* For badminton, there's an outside court, having 2 courts side by side in sports complex and 1 indoor court, for professional players. Faculty also play in indoor court. Apart from these, there's court in each hostel for badminton.
* For table tennis, there's table in each hostel, and there's a special hostel where it is reserved for professional players.
* For volleyball, there's a court in each hostel, and 2 courts in sports complex for professionals.
* For basketball, there's a court in sports complex and some hostels have separate courts, but not maintained. KUK has 3 courts, which is like 500m from our sports complex.
* For football, there's huge ground in sports complex, which is pretty well maintained.
* For cricket, well, you can use the sports ground, or go to KU. You can play gully cricket in Hostels itself, there's more than enough space.
* Yoga classes are held daily at sports complex.
* There's also a 400m athletic track.
* There's also a lawn tennis court, but no one plays lawn tennis.
* Kabaddi is also played in sports complex. There's a bit separate area for that..
* Gym is also there, but is always crowded. You have to join gym outside campus.
* There's a swimming pool as well, which is closed since covid. They did open it last year I guess, Idk what happened to it. Never went there. I guess I covered all the sports that I know. Also, you can borrow the equipment like balls, rackets etc. from sports complex, but only till 5 pm. If you are professional, they'll allow you to keep it for night as well. Do let me know if I missed anything.

**Singing/Dancing/Acting :** There are clubs for each of these and pretty active. They win a lot of competitions. There's SAC (student activity centre) and a Jubilee hall for practising.

**Other Facilities :**

* There's a hospital in campus, which is more or less worthless. But they do have an ambulance, which is quite responsive and fast, you call them and they actually come pretty fast. If it's critical injury, they can take you to the Government hospital, which is just outside KUK 2nd gate, not much far away for campus. Also, you can go for other better private hospital as well.
* Library is okayish. There's an AC side, which is closed at 5pm. The other side has cooler, but library needs improvement for sure. It is completely filled in exam days. There's also a CCN library, which is a lot better, has AC 24x7, but you can't take laptop inside. But they have their own pc, and you can use them. So it's more of a lab cum library. It may also get filled in peak time, but most of the times, it's fine
* There's a really good temple on campus, which is well maintained.
* Campus is fairly clean. Hostels are cleaned daily (washrooms and corridors) at around 10 am. All the departments are also cleaned daily.
* There's fully automatic washing machines in each hostel, and they charge Rs 50-80 on full machine. There are 3-4 in each hostel, and there's always an empty one.
* There's also a beautiful lake within the campus, and it is really calm and nice.
* Also, there's Brahma Sarovar, which is very huge lake, and not far from campus. It is the favourite evening spot for most people.
* There are a lot of good temples nearby -- you are coming to Kurukshetra, the city where Shri Krishna Ji delivered the Bhagavad Gita! Kurukshetra is a sacred city.

# Hostels

Boys Hostels are mostly okayish, Girls hostels are a lot better.

* There are 10 boys hostel for BTech students. You have to take hostel if you don't live within 7km of campus, you can't skip it.
* In first year, boys will be given old hostel, with 4 sharing room! It is okayish, there will be a table, a couple of chairs, 4 beds, 3/4 almirah, a balcony. Mess is good in all of the first year hostels. Girls will be given single room in first year as well. The room will be mostly alloted on lucky draw basis. So, it's completely on your luck how your room mates will be. But make sure to have good bonding with them, because
* 2nd year onwards, you will be given single room. The guys that were your room mates will be given room adjacent to you. Single rooms are decent, there will be a table, a chair, a bed, a fan, a almirah.
* You should buy cooler, because it's pretty hot. There are separate electricity charges of Rs. 500/month if you have a cooler.
* Girls mess second year onwards is okayish.
* Boys mess is good in general -- except H10. H10 has much better infra but worst mess, other hostels have old infra but good mess.
* You can exchange room if you can find a guy who is ready to exchange.

# Academics

It is one of the chillest college of this level. There's very few assignments, and you can do them in lab only. There's no academic pressure at all. But you do have to study to pass exams and have a decent CGPA.

* There are 3 exams - Mid1, Mid2 and end sem. Mid1 and Mid2 have 20 marks each, and end sem has 50 marks. So final grade is calculated internal assesment (10) + Mid1 + Mid2 + Endsem.
* You have to pass separately in internal (mid1+mid2+assessment) and external (end sem). Passing means 20 out of 50.
* Program Coordinator has all the power, he has final decision. They are generally the teacher that teaches you. Don't mess with them. Although, they are very nice and polite in general, but a few are very rude. Make sure to ask your seniors before hand about each professor.
* The curriculum is fairly latest, it was revised in 2022 only. It is revised every 5 years I guess. For CSE and IT, there are subject for each language, C, C++, Java, Python and 3 subjects for DSA, 1 for CP, and for DBMS, Network etc. Curriculum is best possible, don't worry about it.
* All departments are pretty clean, have good greenary around them. They also have parking space for cycle.
* Classes are fully air conditioned and pretty large. You can see videos on youtube maybe. Similarly, labs are very nice and well equiped as well. They have good air conditioners, and working PC. They are all well maintained and clean.
* There is pretty good research facilities as well. There is a super computer in CS department, you can get access if you have some serious work, from HOD/CCN head. Other department guys can also access it.
* Senior professors will always welcome you to research under their guidance. Also, if you want to go for higher studies, you can directly talk to them and do research under them. They have connections in the top universities, and can help you a lot, if you do research under them. So, it will benefit both, both of you get research paper, and you get admission in good college for higher studies / get a good job.

So, yeah, I guess I covered most of it. If you have any doubt, do let me know.",16,1749120074.0,Btechtards,13,0.9,False

no rubbery, burnt tire taste here. it’s actually rather light and airy, tasting like darkly roasted almonds (from a rather medium roast). lots of crema and some serious body, with a conical burr grinder it would be incredibly syrupy and thick, and probably sweeter. 

as a plain espresso shot (16g in 32g out) it was very rich, but with some steamed milk in a cortado it was incredible. as i’m writing this i’m definitely noting the difference in caffeine levels though, it’s a bit intense. 

with coffee prices soaring globally due to trading tensions and climate change, i seriously recommend you guys to search for and buy a bag of speciality robusta beans. i don’t think 100% arabica means anything anymore. ",0,1749120054.0,espresso,8,0.46,False

1l3vy0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodOmensAfterDark/comments/1l3vy0h/what_if_this_is_season_3/,What if this is season 3?,"This fic (https://archiveofourown.org/works/19904056) is from 2019, and was inspired by a Dr Who episode. It was recommended to me specifically because I enjoyed said episode, and as I read it, the “hold on” lights started blinking. 

This is a well-written and sweet fic, and it’s only 16k words. I recommend you go and read it before you read the rest of this post! Because…

⬇️HERE COMETH SPOILERS⬇️
…………………………………………………………

Aziraphale is temporarily turned into a human by Crowley because the angels believe Aziraphale to be impervious to hellfire. He would be a great weapon against Hell. In human form, he would not register as an angel at all, and Heaven would not be able to find him. Aziraphale forgets he ever was an angel, and believes he is a man named Ezra who runs a bookshop in Cardiff (that Crowley miracled there for him). 

Right before Crowley hides all Aziraphale’s memories in a pocket watch, Aziraphale asks that Crowley will be around, be Aziraphale’s friend even when he is in human form. 

Plot happens, and the angels (Gabriel among them) figure out where Aziraphale is hiding. Just as the first showdown of Armageddon (if I understood that bit right) is about to happen, Aziraphale gets his memories back from the watch and professes his love for Crowley. 

Gabriel sees this, halts Armageddon and calls up Beelzebub to tell them that “look, demons can feel love!” - this was apparently the plan all along. Gabriel did not want the world to end, he just wanted to be with Beelzebub. 

…

So. The writer was already right about Gabriel and the way he ‘nah’d Armageddon at the last hour, just because he’d rather be with Beez. The showdown is eerily similar to the showdown in S02E6, but with some pieces missing or rearranged. 

And, it wouldn’t be too weird if, in season 3, Aziraphale had to hide from the angels by pretending he was human somewhere far away (would explain the bookshop in Edinburg and the very human aesthetic). Wouldn’t be too weird if an amnesia plot took place either, maybe literally inspired by what happened in S02. “If Gabriel could do it, so could I,” Aziraphale could say. 

And it does make sense that the angels believe Aziraphale to be some sort of super angel after what happened at the end of S01. 

I know that a certain author of this story (not the fic, the show) claims not to read and be inspired by fanfics, but they certainly claimed a lot of things that turned out to be less that trustworthy, didn’t they? And season 2, though I love it to bits, is a coffee shop human AU with “bad at communication” tags and a very contrived excuse for a romantic ball. Again, love it to bits, exactly *for* these tropes, but they are common tropes in most fandoms, and S2 does have a very different vibe to S1… All I’m saying is that I wouldn’t be surprised if Someone knew what was popular on AO3. 

———

So, what do you think? Especially those of you who (hopefully) read the fic — do you agree that based on what we know about S03 (and S02) this fic writer seems a bit of a Nutter? (The Agnes kind)

So, you get the idea.

This year, the 6 months intern + FTE rule in 8th sem came in october, so many companies could not visit (including Apple, they were actually coming). Next year onwards, much much more companies will be visiting, but there is risk in 8th sem intern+performance based FTE because if you don't get PPO, you are basically unemployed after graduation. Most colleges include these students as FTE in stats and hence, number looks inflated.

So, the placements this year were pretty good.

So, you get to enjoy KUK facilities as well, like sports ground, without having much trouble. In fact we have quite good bonding with KUK guys, and play together in the evening (basketball).

Although, NIT Kurukshetra is located in Thanesar, which is like a bit outer side of Kurukshetra, yet all the facilities are available on campus. You have blinkit, zomato etc. services available.

**Facilities in Campus :** There is a market, with various shops, like general store, stationary store, medical store, juice shop, SBI Bank branch and ATM, barber, washing/dry cleaning shop, 1 small eatery and a Dominos! There's also a senate hall canteen, which serves decently good food at fairly cheap prices. Apart from these, there's a Moxie, that is again serving food/tea, but has much more variety. There's also a juice corner in front of library.

But all of these are open till 9pm-11pm only. If you want late night food, there's a lot of options there too. There's maggie hotspot near the boys hostel, that serves around 10 types of maggie, has nestle coffee machine, nestle chocolates, burgers and sandwiches etc. Another option is H6 shop, that has variety of packed food, like chips, kurkure, cold drink, biscuits etc and also maggie and paranthas. These open till 2pm.

If you are still not satified / want food at 3 am / want non veg, there's eateries just outside the main gate, that deliver food at backgate even till 3am ( I haven't tested after that, but they do deliver at 3 am ). You can order anything from them - they have fairly large menu and cheap prices.

**Sports :** Sports facilities are good. Sports complex is generally open till 9pm, and have good floodlights for late night matches. Sports complex is really well maintained.

* For badminton, there's an outside court, having 2 courts side by side in sports complex and 1 indoor court, for professional players. Faculty also play in indoor court. Apart from these, there's court in each hostel for badminton.
* For table tennis, there's table in each hostel, and there's a special hostel where it is reserved for professional players.
* For volleyball, there's a court in each hostel, and 2 courts in sports complex for professionals.
* For basketball, there's a court in sports complex and some hostels have separate courts, but not maintained. KUK has 3 courts, which is like 500m from our sports complex.
* For football, there's huge ground in sports complex, which is pretty well maintained.
* For cricket, well, you can use the sports ground, or go to KU. You can play gully cricket in Hostels itself, there's more than enough space.
* Yoga classes are held daily at sports complex.
* There's also a 400m athletic track.
* There's also a lawn tennis court, but no one plays lawn tennis.
* Kabaddi is also played in sports complex. There's a bit separate area for that..
* Gym is also there, but is always crowded. You have to join gym outside campus.
* There's a swimming pool as well, which is closed since covid. They did open it last year I guess, Idk what happened to it. Never went there. I guess I covered all the sports that I know. Also, you can borrow the equipment like balls, rackets etc. from sports complex, but only till 5 pm. If you are professional, they'll allow you to keep it for night as well. Do let me know if I missed anything.

**Singing/Dancing/Acting :** There are clubs for each of these and pretty active. They win a lot of competitions. There's SAC (student activity centre) and a Jubilee hall for practising.

**Other Facilities :**

* There's a hospital in campus, which is more or less worthless. But they do have an ambulance, which is quite responsive and fast, you call them and they actually come pretty fast. If it's critical injury, they can take you to the Government hospital, which is just outside KUK 2nd gate, not much far away for campus. Also, you can go for other better private hospital as well.
* Library is okayish. There's an AC side, which is closed at 5pm. The other side has cooler, but library needs improvement for sure. It is completely filled in exam days. There's also a CCN library, which is a lot better, has AC 24x7, but you can't take laptop inside. But they have their own pc, and you can use them. So it's more of a lab cum library. It may also get filled in peak time, but most of the times, it's fine
* There's a really good temple on campus, which is well maintained.
* Campus is fairly clean. Hostels are cleaned daily (washrooms and corridors) at around 10 am. All the departments are also cleaned daily.
* There's fully automatic washing machines in each hostel, and they charge Rs 50-80 on full machine. There are 3-4 in each hostel, and there's always an empty one.
* There's also a beautiful lake within the campus, and it is really calm and nice.
* Also, there's Brahma Sarovar, which is very huge lake, and not far from campus. It is the favourite evening spot for most people.
* There are a lot of good temples nearby -- you are coming to Kurukshetra, the city where Shri Krishna Ji delivered the Bhagavad Gita! Kurukshetra is a sacred city.

# Hostels

Boys Hostels are mostly okayish, Girls hostels are a lot better.

* There are 10 boys hostel for BTech students. You have to take hostel if you don't live within 7km of campus, you can't skip it.
* In first year, boys will be given old hostel, with 4 sharing room! It is okayish, there will be a table, a couple of chairs, 4 beds, 3/4 almirah, a balcony. Mess is good in all of the first year hostels. Girls will be given single room in first year as well. The room will be mostly alloted on lucky draw basis. So, it's completely on your luck how your room mates will be. But make sure to have good bonding with them, because
* 2nd year onwards, you will be given single room. The guys that were your room mates will be given room adjacent to you. Single rooms are decent, there will be a table, a chair, a bed, a fan, a almirah.
* You should buy cooler, because it's pretty hot. There are separate electricity charges of Rs. 500/month if you have a cooler.
* Girls mess second year onwards is okayish.
* Boys mess is good in general -- except H10. H10 has much better infra but worst mess, other hostels have old infra but good mess.
* You can exchange room if you can find a guy who is ready to exchange.

# Academics

It is one of the chillest college of this level. There's very few assignments, and you can do them in lab only. There's no academic pressure at all. But you do have to study to pass exams and have a decent CGPA.

* There are 3 exams - Mid1, Mid2 and end sem. Mid1 and Mid2 have 20 marks each, and end sem has 50 marks. So final grade is calculated internal assesment (10) + Mid1 + Mid2 + Endsem.
* You have to pass separately in internal (mid1+mid2+assessment) and external (end sem). Passing means 20 out of 50.
* Program Coordinator has all the power, he has final decision. They are generally the teacher that teaches you. Don't mess with them. Although, they are very nice and polite in general, but a few are very rude. Make sure to ask your seniors before hand about each professor.
* The curriculum is fairly latest, it was revised in 2022 only. It is revised every 5 years I guess. For CSE and IT, there are subject for each language, C, C++, Java, Python and 3 subjects for DSA, 1 for CP, and for DBMS, Network etc. Curriculum is best possible, don't worry about it.
* All departments are pretty clean, have good greenary around them. They also have parking space for cycle.
* Classes are fully air conditioned and pretty large. You can see videos on youtube maybe. Similarly, labs are very nice and well equiped as well. They have good air conditioners, and working PC. They are all well maintained and clean.
* There is pretty good research facilities as well. There is a super computer in CS department, you can get access if you have some serious work, from HOD/CCN head. Other department guys can also access it.
* Senior professors will always welcome you to research under their guidance. Also, if you want to go for higher studies, you can directly talk to them and do research under them. They have connections in the top universities, and can help you a lot, if you do research under them. So, it will benefit both, both of you get research paper, and you get admission in good college for higher studies / get a good job.

So, yeah, I guess I covered most of it. If you have any doubt, do let me know.

1l3vv5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1l3vv5u/i_hate_how_people_in_management_positions_act_as/,I hate how people in management positions act as though they are the saviour to everything,"I had a meeting the other day with two bone idle managers who both seemingly do absolutely nothing all day aside from going for “well-being walks” and “coffee breaks”.

You can never get hold of them. They have no technical know how. But they walk the earth as if they are the reincarnation of Aristotle. Always spewing out stuff like “a good manager is mostly hands off”. “I build good teams”. “Don’t reinvent the wheel”. etc etc. yawn. 

Most of it is just HR speak to justify why they get paid double what everybody else gets paid despite them actually doing no work. 

They also generate zero income for the company and their salaries are huge in comparison to the output they produce. 

Why are they so arrogant?!????

I don’t understand it?!???

Do they genuinely believe that they are as critical as they think they are or is it all just a load of bullshit to keep up the illusion that they are needed. 

They are also all mostly nepo hires that people in the company have been friends with. They completely miss every level of progression and get in right at the top of middle management which is massively unfair to anybody else in the company who wants to move up the ladder. 

The issue is that anytime we ask for a salary increase they say “no we can’t afford it”. And then every month they appoint another “team lead” on triple what you earn…. like wtf. It makes no sense. 

I honestly think we need a 2008 style recession.

I don’t even care anymore. 

The bloat of middle management in companies is insane.

I have 9 levels of management tiers above myself before it gets to the CEO of the company. 

How are these management jobs even real?!??? 

It is a huge waste of money when you can’t afford to reward the people at the bottom who are actually doing all the work. ",34,1749119654.0,antiwork,8,0.92,False

As is apparently tradition when turning 30, I’ve started eyeing a proper espresso setup — you know, the lever-pulling, milk-frothing kind of thing.

I currently use a fully automatic machine. Weekday mornings, I make myself a milk coffee to go for the commute. On weekends, I enjoy 2–3 cappuccinos and often make some for my girlfriend too. At cafés, I usually go for cappuccinos, lattes, or milk coffee — rarely espresso on its own.

That’s part of my hesitation: I’m not quite sure what I actually *like* when it comes to espresso. Many cappuccinos at cafés taste too bitter or sour to me. I’m not experienced enough to tell what’s good or bad — just what I enjoy (which tends to be smooth and balanced with milk).

I love the *idea* of having a machine at home — as a hobby, something meditative maybe, and to share better coffee moments. But the upfront cost is significant, and I’m not sure if I’ll really enjoy the process long-term or if it’ll turn into a chore once the novelty wears off.

I’ve already fallen down the Reddit rabbit hole of machines, grinders, burr geometry, heat exchangers vs dual boilers, etc. So now I’m stuck between curiosity and caution.

In terms of gear, I’m currently considering:

* **Grinder**: DF54 or something comparable in that range.
* **Machine**: Either the **Dedica** or **Bambino**, possibly with mods — or maybe something a bit higher-end if it’s worth the investment (e.g., Lelit Victoria, Rancilio Silvia, or entry-level dual boiler?).

This post was originally written in German — I had help in  translate it for me so I could ask you all here 

So, for those who were in a similar position:

* Did the investment into a home setup pay off for you?
* Did you end up enjoying the hobby part of it?
* How steep was the learning curve really?
* Any regrets, or unexpected positives?

Thanks in advance — I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences!",0,1749119289.0,espresso,9,0.4,False
