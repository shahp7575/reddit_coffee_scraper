Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

After ranting about how they don’t have any of their desires and the fact that their life got worse after learning about the law, they claim that they can’t give up on manifesting because they know it works. After being in that community long enough and seeing the very insignificant “success stories”, I know that these individuals are basing their belief in the law on their ability to manifest things that don’t really matter in the long run. This is why I hate when they tell you to “start off small to build your belief in the law”. By the time you’ve successfully “manifested” a phone call or $20, you’re all in and fully convinced that you can get anything you want no matter how big. When that inevitably doesn’t happen, it’s extremely hard to let go because you think you’re doing something wrong when you’re doing the exact techniques and thought patterns that worked for getting compliments and free coffee. At this point, you “know” the law is real and will spend hundreds if not thousands on coaching and courses to get to the bottom of why you’re not manifesting. When that doesn’t work, you’ll continue to watch videos and try new techniques for years before throwing in the towel.

I'm Sonny, 38, male, from the Midlands in jolly old England and I have no style. I'm happily married to my incredibly patient wife, work full time as some kind of IT project guy thingy and spend a lot of my free time immersed in some sort of nerdy media format or another.

I'm an introverted person, but I wouldn't say I'm anti-social. I have friends, but between working from home the last few years, my interests and my anxiety some days, I don't get out as often as I'd like, so it wouldn't hurt to meet and chat with some new people.

As far as interests go, Video games are my core interest. I have an unhealthy interest in Zero Build modes of Fortnite at the moment, but I can be seen playing a broad range of stuff from Power Wash Sim to COD to Project Zomboid to Sea of Thieves. There's plenty of other options, squirrels are to nuts what I am to video games...

Other interests include anime, comedy, a sense of humour, reading fiction, writing, autumn, fantasy, sci-fi, food, coffee, nature, computing, D&D, jigsaws, rain, bread, board games, Lego, doom-scrolling Tiktok, a decent variety of music, making unimportant lists that are disorganised and go on too long, and probably other stuff too. I dislike horror (unless it's in book format), fashion, sports, corporate-ladders and cauliflower. Even if it's not listed as an interest, doesn't mean I won't be interested in chatting about it, can be fun to learn new things.

I'm diagnosed with social anxiety, which can mean I sometimes fail to reach out or may seem less engaged than I actually am to begin with, and I'm diagnosed ADHD(-C) so can be a bit forgetful, absent-minded or erratic at times. Do with that info what you will. I'm accountable for these things, I'm always working on them, but don't say you weren't warned!

My only caveats would be that you are a very definitely defined as an adult and that your intentions are aligned with the subs, i.e., you're looking to make platonic friends, whole platonic friends and nothing but platonic friends, so help you Reddit. Also don't be closed minded or come baring any kind of bigotry, I've no interest in any of that and might be inclined to tell you to go forth and multiply. I generally approach these things slowly, I am only looking to text chat for the moment but may voice chat and have a game with people in the future, so be chill and be patient too I guess.

The ideal venue to chat would be Discord in the long term but I'm on Reddit frequently enough if you're not comfortable with that though. If you do reach out, introduce yourself a little (since you already have some info about me and I'd prefer not to have to start with an interrogation) and throw something that's your favourite to confirm you've read at least the caveats bit even if you switched off at some of the other parts.

1gnahm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/clusterheads/comments/1gnahm1/planks/,Planks,"Planks have worked well for me as an abortive or to take the edge off quickly. 

I’ve had clusters for 12 years now and have tried everything under the sun (meds and otherwise) and wish I’d tried this earlier. 

When you feel an attack coming on, pop down into a plank and focus on exhaling forcefully for as long as you can reasonably hold. Tighten your core / try to keep a flat back, which will draw blood flow most around your core and legs and offer relief. 

I’ve found this works particularly well in combination with caffeine, which sometimes takes a while to take effect. Basically down a cup of coffee and then do a plank for as long as I can hold, and by the time I feel the plank in my abs the headache starts to dissipate. 

As with all abortives, this works better if you catch the attack earlier. 

I used to do a lot of pushups or squats to exhaustion (which also helps), which was really tiring and taking a toll on my body, but I’ve found that planks take the edge off faster and can be sustained longer / repeated longer.

This works also with wall sits - probably any isometric that engages the largest muscle groups, drawing blood flow away from the brain - but planks are probably the best for whole body (legs, core, arms / shoulders). 

Isometric exercises are most effective at lowering blood flow (https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/your-health/living-well/how-a-one-minute-plank-can-lower-your-blood-pressure#).

1gnagrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1gnagrg/how_much_should_i_estimate_to_get_a_sports/,"How much should I estimate to get a sports documentary off the ground?    Plus, tips on what to include in Pitch Deck?  ","I have an opportunity to direct a sports documentary, and last month I flew out on location to interview a few of the main subjects to create a pitch video with the goal to show to potential producers and investors to raise funds.

The trip in total cost me $2,100 in expenses alone ( I didn't pay myself)  but with flights, rental car, gear rentals, checked bags, gas.  That was the cost.  no crew.  I shot and lit everything myself and asked the questions. I stayed at my parents place and ate with them so food was very minimal and I even used a lot of my own gear to shoot.  I rented a  couple of nice lenses and a good mic but other than that I use my own stuff and did not factor that into my expenses for the total above.

My question is, when I start sharing this pitch video along with a pitch deck, and I inevitably get the questions how much money we need to get the Documentary made....I'm not sure how much?  because I don't have a crew yet.

I'm not sure what the day rates will be of the people I want to hire because I need to hire people still.  So how does one estimate the cost of something like this?

  
My current estimates/thought process is, if it cost me $2,000 in expenses for what was a 2 day shoot (1 day of interviews and I stayed an extra day to shoot the game) and I'm expecting a 3 day shoot of interviews and b-roll, and paying: myself, an audio guy and a 2 person camera crew and paying for food, coffee, etc it would be approx $18,000

  
Should I include all of my pre-production working days in this estimate cost?  Should I include editing in this estimate ""get off the ground"" cost?  Should I add in more money and have a PA/Runner who can just be there in case we need a battery from bestbuy or a new cable or the DP and 1st AC are behind the camera and I'm prepping an interview subject and they need the PA to sit in frame? 

  
I'm just going to be filming interviews.  I'll have to acquire old game footage and photos from the college and other proper resources but that's not necessary to get this off the ground, that will be an expense later.

  
There's also a pretty large possibility that this will be longer than a 3 day shoot.  Because not everyone is located in the same city nor same state, so I'll have to find a different camera crew and travel for 1 day shoots in other locations as well.  but the 3 day shoot will be the bulk of it and I'll probably have to fly to meet the others where they are.  I guess I can also do some cost analysis on is it cheaper for me to fly them to me and put them in a hotel etc vs me flying to them and finding a new crew and new gear rentals and hotel for me etc.

  
Thank you so much.  I've come so far in getting this thing done and a lot of research and I'd love to seize this opportunity but I'm not sure what dollar amount I should be aiming for

What we ended up doing was going to a pub that we both really love. We both got giant salads that are top tier, I had a tequila soda and she got a Long Island iced tea. I had a pb&j shot later and she had another Long Island which she couldn’t finish. We also ordered some wings to bring home. (We were at the place a while and i was good to drive by all means.)

Then we rode to a cupcake store and got some for us, my parents (who babysat), and for our kids. 

We then stopped by guitar center because she told me that she wanted to buy me a guitar for Christmas and I should just go pick up one now. 

We were in the store looking and I kept grabbing more affordable guitars and practicing on. She was joking with me and listening. Eventually she pointed up to a guitar on the top rack and said that’s the one that I deserved. She told me how she wanted me to have that one. We left with a Taylor 224 CE Grand Auditorium. This is a grail guitar. 

We went by target and grabbed our kids a small toy each.

We went to Krispy Kreme for a coffee because Starbucks at target closed. For some reason KK always forgets to put creamer in our coffee too.

My son was supposed to stay the night but my mom called and said they both were coughing some and would probably be better off being home. 

We grabbed the kids and came home. 

The plans were for some alone time, eating wings, and watching how I met your mother. But we spent the night making sure our kids are good.

Song - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4aOr94FYsM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4aOr94FYsM)  
  
""Tabaco y Chanel"" by Bacilos is a ballad about the lingering memories of a past love. The song opens with the description of a scent that reminds the narrator of their former lover; a mixture of tobacco and Chanel perfume. The fragrance brings back memories of their skin and the taste of their kisses, as well as a feeling of regret over their absence.

The chorus repeats the idea that the combination of tobacco and Chanel, like a mix of honey and coffee, is a strong reminder of the missing person. Even the stars seem to ask about her and beg for the narrator to come back to her. The second verse describes a love that never truly bloomed but still resonates within the memory of the narrator.

The bridge suggests that the stars have a hand in separating the couple, and maintaining their distance. But despite the separation, the scent still remains, and the love is still strong. The ending of the song repeats the refrain emphasizing that the scent and memories do not leave and the love is still very much alive.

&#x200B;

 

Tottenham's thumping of Villa last weekend came at a significant cost, as [**Richarlison**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/richarlison/) pulled his hamstring while setting up Solanke's goal and is expected to be out until December, while [**Cristian Romero**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cristian-romero/) hurt his toe and had to come off as well.

Postecoglou has not ruled Romero out of Sunday's game just yet - the same goes for [**Djed Spence**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/djed-spence/) (groin) - but [**Timo Werner**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/timo-werner/) (groin) and [**Mikey Moore**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mikey-moore/) (illness) are unlikely to return, while [**Wilson Odobert**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/wilson-odobert/) (hamstring) and [**Micky van de Ven**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/micky-van-de-ven/) (hamstring) are definitely out.

[**Will Lankshear**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/will-lankshear/)'s red card in Europe also means nothing for the Premier League, but £65m man Solanke is sure to return to the attacking trident; no Premier League player has applied more pressures than his 212 in the final third this season.

However, [**Kalvin Phillips**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kalvin-phillips/)'s sending-off against Leicester for two bookable offences means that the Manchester City loanee will have to sit out Sunday's game through suspension; [**Jens Cajuste**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jens-cajuste/) and [**Massimo Luongo**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/massimo-luongo/) are scrapping it out to deputise for him.

Defender [**Harry Clarke**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-clarke/) is leaving the naughty step after serving his own suspension, though, while [**Chiedozie Ogbene**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chiedozie-ogbene/) (Achilles), [**Axel Tuanzebe**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/axel-tuanzebe/) (hand), [**Jacob Greaves**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jacob-greaves/) (thigh), [**Jack Taylor**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jack-taylor/) (unspecified) and [**Janoi Donacien**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/janoi-donacien/) (ankle) will miss out through injury.

A product of the Tottenham Hotspur academy ranks for three seasons, attacker [**Jack Clarke**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jack-clarke/) is at the head of the queue for promotion from the Ipswich bench this weekend, where he could very well replace [**Sammie Szmodics**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sammie-szmodics/) or [**Conor Chaplin**](https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/conor-chaplin/) to face his former employers.

# Match Stats

&#x200B;

 

**Head-to-head**

* Ipswich have won the last three meetings, all of which have been in the Premier League, including both fixtures in their most recent top-flight season in 2001-02.
* The Blues won 2-1 at White Hart Lane in December 2001 thanks to goals from Finidi George and Alun Armstrong but that is their only away victory versus Spurs in the past 31 years.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Tottenham Hotspur**

* Spurs have come from behind to win 24 points at home this calendar year – 10 more than any other Premier League side.
* They have conceded the opening goal in 12 of 14 home league matches in 2024 (W8, L4).
* Ange Postecoglou’s side won all three of their home league games against promoted opposition last season by a 2-1 scoreline despite falling behind.
* The Londoners have not drawn any of their past 26 Premier League home fixtures, one short of an outright record for any club in the division.
* Their only clean sheet in 20 top-flight home games came in August’s 4-0 win against Everton.
* Brennan Johnson has netted four goals in his last six league appearances after scoring just five in his first 36 top-flight matches for the club. His father, David, spent just over three years as a player at Ipswich at the turn of the century.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ipswich Town**

* Ipswich have led for a league-low 86 minutes this season but have nonetheless dropped 12 points from winning positions – second only to Brentford's 14 prior to the weekend’s fixtures.
* The Tractor Boys have opened the scoring in five of 10 league games this term, losing two and drawing three of those matches.
* Town have failed to win any of their opening 10 league fixtures, a club record from the start of a top-flight season. It is four short of their longest such streak in any division, set in the Championship under Roy Keane in 2009-10.
* Ipswich’s only victory in their past 23 top-flight matches was a 1-0 home win against Middlesbrough in April 2002, courtesy of Darren Bent's goal.
* They are winless in 12 Premier League away games since a 2-1 victory at Everton in February 2002 (D3, L9).
* Liam Delap is vying to become the third Ipswich player to score in three consecutive Premier League away matches, emulating Chris Kiwomya in 1992 and Claus Thomsen in 1994.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

#  Key lines from Ange's news conference 

&#x200B;

 

* He started by joking that he is on his third coffee of the morning after a quick turnaround from the European fixture in Turkey.
* The team ""came through unscathed"" so there are no new injury concerns.
* Cristian Romero has a chance of being available but Micky van de Ven and Timo Werner will not return until after the international break.
* On Richarlison: ""We are very disappointed. We were doing everything right, trying not to overload him but unfortunately he broke down again. He's disappointed.""
* He said ""we can't afford any more injuries"" among his forwards, so they are managing captain Son Heung-min's minutes. Postecoglou added: ""He obviously had the injury and we brought him back and he had a relapse. We don't want to put him in that position. We’re building him up and managing his minutes.""
* On opponents Ipswich: ""Every weekend and every league game has its potential to hurt you if you're not at your best. Ipswich will be no different. I think Kieran McKenna has done an unbelievable job.""
* He said ""it would be fair to say that, apart from [**Liverpool**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool), no-one has hit consistency"" in the Premier League so far and that is down to ""significant injuries"" at some of the top clubs.
* On Spurs' top-four ambitions: ""We have to just keep progressing in the way we have been. In the large part, our football has been consistent and pretty good.""

# Pundit Predictions

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>**Mark Lawrenson**  
>  
>When you’re away in Turkey during the week this is exactly the kind of fixture Tottenham would want next. Ipswich were winning last time out and dropped points with a red card and some VAR nonsense as well. Spurs always score at home, I’m not sure Ipswich will. **Tottenham 2-0 Ipswich.** 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>**Paul Merson**  
>  
>I expect [Tottenham](https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/tottenham-hotspur) to win this game quite comfortably. I don't know how Ipswich are going to survive. They dominated the game against Leicester last weekend but ended up shooting themselves in the foot and conceded a late equaliser. That's a big problem for them.  
>  
>When you look at Spurs' fixtures so far this season, you'd have expected them to be higher up the table. They got a good win over Aston Villa and have managed to win four out of their last five games across competitions. Spurs are certainly on the right track. But let's not forget that they are also the team that drew with Leicester and lost to Crystal Palace.  
>  
>You don't know what you're going to get from them. They also have a really tough game away from home to Galatasaray in the Europa Conference League coming up. But still, I expect Tottenham to get the better of Ipswich.  
>  
>**Prediction:** **Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Ipswich Town**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>**Alan Shearer**  
>  
>Ipswich haven't convinced me yet and I think they'll find it really tough at Tottenham this weekend, with Spurs winning two huge games at home last week. If they manage to maintain some consistency, Ange and Spurs will have a fantastic season.  
>  
>I'd expect Tottenham to score a goal or two here with the number of chances they create, and Ipswich don't look like they will be able to keep them at bay. Kalvin Phillips is suspended too, so another home win.  
>  
>**Alan's prediction: Tottenham to Win**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>**Chris Sutton**  
>  
>I got a lot of stick for saying I supported Nottingham Forest last week - as well as a few of the clubs that I played for; Norwich, Blackburn and Celtic - and regular 5 live listeners will know that I have been accused of having Tottenham as another one of my teams.  
>  
>They aren't, but I make no apologies for being a fan of Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou and his style of expansive football. At times it is crazy, with the risks they take, but I love watching it.  
>  
>My Canaries connection means no-one is going to ever mistake me for an Ipswich fan, so this may shock a few people, but I felt sorry for them last week.  
>  
>They have briefly come out of Norwich's shadow to reach the Premier League and are desperate for their first win of the season, but they were on the wrong end of a couple of shocking late decisions in their draw with Leicester.  
>  
>They have the advantage of not having European football this week - they have not had to worry about that for more than 20 years - while Tottenham play Galatasaray in Turkey on Thursday.  
>  
>I still think Spurs will win, though, and Ipswich will be back in the Championship with Norwich next season.  
>  
>**Sutton's prediction:** **3-1**

1gna1g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1gna1g3/trip_report_281024_81124/,Trip report 28.10.24 - 8.11.24,"We are a couple in early 30s. This was my husband's first and my second time in korea. We stayed in seoul and busan. We couldn't do Jeju though.
First 3 days were in seoul we stayed in jongno hotel venue g. We explored myeongdong and namdaemun on day 2 did some shopping.

Day 3 - spent at gyeongbokyung palace, bukchon hanok village and ikseondong. We lost our card wallet in our Uber taxi on the way to Seoul station where we wanted to keep a part of our luggage before heading to busan the next day 

Day 4 - ktx to busan. Checked into hotel in haeundae. We loved haeundae easy to navigate, beautiful beach. Unfortunately booked a late slot at the blueline park and missed the sunset we had a ride in complete darkness could only see the lit up high rise buildings and the bridge. So I suggest to always book a daytime slot at the blueline park. We went to the street market and also did some shopping.

Day 5 - went to haedong yongungsa temple..I think it was my favourite part of Busan trip. Beautiful views, serene atmosphere and felt divine. Even though it rained the entire day I still loved the temple so much. Evening we just explored the streets again and ate dinner.

Day 6, 7 - we checked out of sunset hotel in haeundae and headed to nampo-dong area in busan..stayed in ocean 2 heaven spa hotel next 2 days. Our first stop was Biff square which we really liked. Great street food though a bit crowded which we didn't mind at all. Some shopping at artbox which was great. We were too late to explore the bosudong book alley :( it was already too dark and they close early.Explored gamcheon village the next day. We didn't get the map offered at the entrance and just explored only few parts. Wish we did get the map and explored better. Overall gamcheon was underwhelming according to the type maybe ppl in 20s would be more inclined due to the cafes and photozones. We headed to bupyeong kkatong night market and ate street foods like crepe, spicy dangmyeon, and tteokboki. 

Day 8 headed back to Seoul on ktx. Felt so sad leaving Busan and also because the trip was almost coming to an end in a couple of days. The second stay at Seoul was in mapo-gu. We stayed at a so called 3 star hotel but it was essentially a upgraded dormitory with very little space. The exterior was really innovative with working space, cafes etc but it's definitely not a typical hotel. Won't stay there again. However we hardly stayed at the hotel except to get ready and sleep. Explored hongdae, did shopping in the small cute shops in the evening

Day 9 went to coex mall to see the library was underwhelming..took photos at the Gangnam style statue..went to the bongunsa temple which was better than the coex library though it's an unfair comparison. At this point I was not feeling gangnam maybe because I didn't do much research as to where to go there. We went to Han river park in mangwon it was really beautiful no tourist just koreans. We had coffee at Starbucks and watched the sunset. Great experience. Did shopping at olive young before 
Meeting a friend for dinner at sinchon

Day 10 we went to war memorial in itaewon I really loved the place and learning about the history of Korea there. Next we went to mangwon market for lunch and headed back to hotel to rest

Day 11 we booked a klook tour to nami island. We wanted to a diy but had no time on hand to plan a proper trip. First part of the tour was petite france and Italian village. We loved nami island next time i would want to spend even more time there. Evening our tour bus made a stop at myeongdong. We shopped at lotte mall for hbaf, chocolates and coffee to take back home. 

Day 12 last minute shopping in hongdae. Took a taxi back to airport 

We used climate card for travelling in seoul - initially just the train and the second part we used more buses and we loved the bus a lot. In Busan we used only taxis or walked by feet in the locality. 

Our Uber driver had our wallet safe which we knew about 2 days after the incident and we were able to meet him once we came back to Seoul. Our storage coffee shop employee was so kind to guide us with the phone calls and took us personally to exit 14 of seoul station where our driver was waiting. It was a happy moment for me and he dropped us at the second hotel in seoul. 

Things I could have done better -

1. It's not easy to do multiple places in a day because a lot of time will be spent in walking and using the public transport 
2. To be extra careful with belongings. Korea is so safe and ppl don't steal often but initial few days were overwhelming until we got a hang of using the subway. So it's easy to lose things if we didn't notice. We were super lucky we took a Uber taxi.
3. Good shoes!! Take a pair or two but good shoes make a world of difference because u are going to be walking a lot
4. Check timings of places whether they close early and time of last order at restaurants.
5. Tax refund at airport is super easy to do but we did it the first time and panicked a bit so couldn't do it for the all the items that we got.
6. Buy an item when u see it. My husband wanted a marvel collectible at Busan and he just ignored it saying he would buy it at Seoul we couldn't find it anywhere else. 
7. Planning in advance regarding the places you want to visit. Although I did research quite well I could have split shopping and sight seeing a little bit better 

Our experience 
It was overall a positive one. We found the koreans we met to be super polite and super helpful. I am really sad as I write the report because I didn't want to leave korea even though it was a good duration of time spent. There was still a lot more to see. I can't wait to go back someday again. Next time maybe we would try staying at an Airbnb just for the experience. Busan was definitely my favourite part of the stay yet next time i would spend more time in seoul and maybe do a trip to gyeongju alone. Climate card was very useful and naver maps essentially made our trip.
Manifesting my next trip starting from now already.

1gn9yyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1gn9yyq/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts – just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let’s clear up a misconception: introversion doesn’t mean we’re anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren’t overwhelming.


Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished – unable to pass on their genes.) That’s one of the factors why we’re here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring—it’s exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It’s a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.


Signs You’re an Introvert with Anxiety—which ones do you relate to the most?
1. You Typically Overprepare
You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control—but it can also be draining.
Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‘’best case scenario’’ – luck isn’t a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn’t stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.


2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic
Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active—sometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.
Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won’t be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‘From Limitations to Liberation’ – it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs. 


3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy
Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it’s a high energy ‘state’ – one of the reasons it can be so tiring)—constantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.
Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‘what is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?’


4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan
Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets – sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.
Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new café. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‘programmed’ by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‘programming’ new avenues of opportunity open up for us.  


5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask
You’ve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not taking a toll internally.
Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it’s just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.


6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations
Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options – see my article ‘Live the life you choose – expand your Thought-Action Repertoire’), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.
Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you’re anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event—like having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.


7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing
Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like “I need everyone to like me to be valuable” create intense anxiety around how you’re perceived.
Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‘them’?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you’re not responsible for everyone else’s happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.


8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker
Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.
Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it’s not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.


9. Trouble Sleeping
Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.
Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it’s time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‘lights out’ time – read until your eyes close and your head nods.


Moving From Awareness to Action
Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it’s also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You’re not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself—there’s strength in softness.


Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert

1.	Create and Protect Your Recharge Time
For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it’s 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you—it’s a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.


2.	Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions
We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.


3.	Prepare and Plan for Social Situations
One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn’t mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don’t even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.


4.	Create a Space at Home that Grounds You
Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed—this could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.


5.	Harness Your Listening Superpower
Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen—this not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.

She moved out of our apartment (we’d been living together for a year) and gave these reasons:
 
1. “I don’t see a future.”
2. “We have different values.”
3. “You’re not ambitious enough,”—this while I was working full-time, playing in a band, making art, and launching a startup.
4. “She gaslit me, suggesting I wasn’t a decent person.
5. “I want to feel more feminine in the relationship.”

She brought all these things up only at the moment of the breakup, not in the months leading up to it. Meanwhile, she kept love-bombing me—lots of affection, intimacy, the works. I was doing everything to be supportive: I took care of groceries, cleaned, made the bed when she got home jet-lagged, made coffee in the mornings, picked her up and dropped her off at the train station, carried her suitcases, opened up conversations about emotions and her needs, cooked, worked full-time (three days from home), invited her to join me for workouts, made tea for us, handled the shopping, and covered expenses.

1gn9x3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/1gn9x3u/quit_smoking_hypnotherapy_with_clear_aversion/,"Quit Smoking Hypnotherapy with ""CLEAR"" Aversion Therapy ","If you’re new to using hypnosis for smoking cessation or just looking for a fresh way to approach it, the CLEAR method is worth trying. 

This 'add-on' technique was something I trained many of my students in as an option to helping clients that held stronger false beliefs about the severity of their addiction, or for those that felt more reassured with the inclusion of Aversion Therapy.

This technique leverages the power of aversion therapy by linking smoking with a strong, repulsive stimulus, making cigarettes something your client’s mind and body want to avoid.

# The CLEAR Method: Clearing Out the Urge to Smoke

1. **Choose a Disgusting Stimulus** First, have your client pick something that grosses them out—a smell, taste, or image they find genuinely repulsive (think along the lines of spoiled food or stale trash). This is what we’ll associate with smoking.
2. **Let Go into Trance** Guide them into a deep state of relaxation to access the subconscious. The more receptive the mind, the stronger the association we’re about to create.
3. **Evoke Smoking Triggers** Have them recall a common moment or trigger for smoking—maybe that first coffee break or when stress kicks in. They’ll capture all the sights, sounds, and feelings in that moment to form a mental snapshot of what usually draws them to a cigarette.
4. **Anchor Aversion** Now, have them focus intensely on the aversive stimulus, amplifying the disgust until it’s really uncomfortable. Then, link this feeling directly to the smoking trigger, creating a powerful mental “yuck” whenever they think of lighting up.
5. **Reinforce and Repeat** Repeat the process a few times to make the association stick. Over time, this reaction becomes automatic, making the thought of smoking downright unpleasant.

# Why It Works

The *CLEAR* method uses the subconscious mind’s natural tendency to pair things together, making it a great tool to “recode” smoking from something enjoyable to something nasty. When done right, your client should start feeling repelled by the idea of smoking.

One of the powerful things about the CLEAR method is that it helps clients develop the same automatic response that lifelong non-smokers often have toward smoking. 

For non-smokers, smoking isn’t just something they don’t do—it’s often something they find genuinely off-putting, almost repulsive. By creating that same foundational belief and gut-level reaction in clients, we’re not just helping them “quit”; we’re helping them adopt the mindset of a true non-smoker. 

This shift in perception can be a game-changer for maintaining long-term success since they no longer see cigarettes as a temptation but rather something they naturally want to avoid.

# The Science & Biology

Neuroscience-wise, the CLEAR approach taps into classical conditioning to help the brain build new, negative associations with smoking. By repeatedly pairing smoking cues with something disgusting, we teach the brain to react automatically with “Yuck!” instead of “Yay!”

The amygdala (emotion central) and the insula (handles cravings) are key players here. When we link smoking to something repulsive, these areas start treating it like something to avoid—a bit like a reflex.

With enough repetition and intensity of the experience, this association sticks through a process called synaptic plasticity, where new neural pathways make the disgust response automatic.

There is clearly a divisive rhetoric that you have been caught up in pre and post election. I’m sure if you’re here you have seen the other posts about the content that Demi has engaged with on Instagram. 

I know you all consider yourselves to be women fighting the patriarchy and forging your own path, which is why I hope you read this and consider shifting your thinking. I understand conservatism is a core value of the LDS culture. But from what we all know of the show, most of you bend those rules to fit your specific needs. The left’s goal is just to do that for everyone. Whether you’re lgbtq, a person of color, a single mom, an immigrant, or just a woman, we want these people to feel safe in accepting themselves whatever that truly means to them. If someone feels most truly themselves wearing a dress or putting on makeup, regardless of gender, why is that so wrong? I understand that LDS rules can be oppressive to those people, but you’ve bent those rules to fit your own personal preferences (drinking coffee, alcohol, laughing gas, etc.). Hell I’m sure even the most devout of you still receives backlash from the more traditional members of the church. 

The most vulnerable people out of these minority groups are now facing attacks from people who do not wish to understand or accept them. I’m sure you understand that feeling well. We protect each other and try to make those people feel safe. We’re not “triggered” we just want those we love in our communities to feel free to have common decency and respect. LDS preaches kindness, and I hope you can see this and maybe understand a lot of the propaganda you have been fed is not entirely accurate. Maybe consider speaking to someone outside of your circle, we are generally very understanding and forgiving people. And I hope, maybe, through this work, you can potentially rethink your stances.

Disclaimer: I'm a bit autistic, please hear me out 😅

I'm a (divorced) 41 yr old momma of two grown boys. I realized last year I needed a power greater than myself to quit drinking. I need(ed) AA. 

My sobriety date is 1.29.24. I started going to AA meetings in 2023, I found a sponsor right quick, derived strength in the promises, dove into service work (made coffee for 6 months 💜), and just finished my steps and step work 🙏🏼

This is where I need and pray someone will break it down for me like I'm 5. Step by step like. Power point like. Bullet point like. 😅

How, please, how do you make something your higher power? 

I understand the concept of a higher power. I was raised devout religious. I offered my teenage years to religious retreats and ministries. I haven't been religious since I was 18. Did I connect to something during that time? I felt so, but as I became an adult the concept didn't continue to make sense. 

Fast forward past childhood trauma and into adulthood, I became spiritual - always drawn to nature but never saw it as a living breathing being until I was an adult, and then I could never unsee it. I talk to nature, I find solice in nature. I need fresh air all the time like I need water. 

Now, I am 9.5 months sober. This program has given me a step by step guide to free myself from the grip of any addiction. Its given me community and understanding, encouragement and hope. I've seen the changes it's made in others and am slowly seeing the changes it's made in me. 

However, I'm at a stand still with my spirituality. I had expectations that by now, I'd have had this beautiful spiritual experience where my higher power would for some reason just pop up and say ""Yay! You're here!"" Like, I'd see it, it would be a physical thing somehow, some way. 

My brain is just... Ug. 

How do I get past this? I've read about making an AA group, like ones home group, a higher power. But those instructions are so confusing for me. I just don't know how to do it. 

How 😭

Paraprofessional. Love my job. For the most part, loved who i work with. It’s a small therapeutic private day school. The work we do to improve the lives of kiddos and young adults warms my soul. Their families are also so sweet. Everyday was like the opening of the Lorax. Everyone is so cheerful and chipper I’m often cheesing from the moment I walk in to the moment I reach my desk upstairs. 

That entire atmosphere evaporated when we returned to work after having Election Day off. My colleague is like a brother to me. He’s a liberal and I’m a conservative leaning libertarian/old school republican. We despise Trump. Our supervising educator (class room teacher) adores him. She dawned wristbands bearing his name and got into a shouting match with another teacher who (understandably) hates him. My brother is a gentle giant. Calm. Silly. Our classroom (until Wednesday) was a place of laughter and joy. Boundless joy with treats and hugs and the like. Our teacher couldn’t help but gossip with her friend in our room as we prepared for the day. I could see my buddy turning red as a tomato. They were talking about how the Trump supporters live in the real world. How nobody wanted to hear from Michelle or “Michael” and that Diddy couldn’t help because he was too busy having freakoffs in the prison without oil. They bragged about trump having nothing to do with Epstein like the Clintons. 

This is where my buddy snapped. He said what about the fact that he’s in pictures with him and seen on video talking about women while dancing with him?

“Doesn’t matter, doesn’t matter.” They said. My buddy is extremely logical. He’s more than qualified to be a teacher, he’s just wise enough not to. At most he will fill in as a substitute. His background is in history and science. This is the last person to make a flawed argument with.  He pounded his desk and blew up at them. 

They apologized fearfully and agreed they shouldn’t be talking politics in class. They’re both old enough to be our parents and almost grandparents. Their pathetic apology made me want to vomit. They hugged him and said we’re here for the students and we love our coworkers. Ughh. Fuck off. 

Anyway, I’ve deliberately been detached from the staff members who are a cult for Trump, and my usual self with those who aren’t. When she approached excitedly about the things I used to also care about, I would blankly stare into her eyes and ask if she needed anything. When she looked at me laughing because something funny was happening, I had a straight face (despite HOWLING in my mind). When she offered treats and such, I robotically declined. We would hangout after dismissal in our class to chat and go over the day with coffee and treats. My buddy and I have left immediately after dismissal lately. Her other friend (old somewhat respectable old man) hasn’t gotten a handshake or greeting since he barged into our class Wednesday and said “I won and I’m going to brag about it all week.” Well, he’s not said anything since then and seemed baffled by being ignored. Yesterday as I was preparing to leave she seemed sad and asked if I was mad at her and needed to talk about anything. I said nope ☺️ “well you just don’t seem like yourself” I basked in the awkward silence without responding until I said “see ya later”

I am debating on leaving.  I took a break from higher paying stressful work and wanted to do something meaningful and helpful. It’s been over two years here. I also don’t know how much longer I can keep it up, but it’s felt wonderful to just not care about social niceties anymore. ",126,1731157727.0,pettyrevenge,30,0.79,False

I'm thinking about buying an Ascaso Steel Duo PID (either Plus or normal, not yet decided) and have some remaining questions.

Little bit about my needs:

For the past 13 years, I have a pre-millennial La Pavoni Professional, pimped with Piston Pressure Gauge, Grouphead Heat Sink and Thermometer, as well as a Grouphead isolator and a bottomless portafilter. As a Grinder, I've moved from manual to a Graef, a Mazzer Mini and now finally to a Niche Zero.

I drink exclusively Espresso, always the same beans (fairly dark roasted), my wife (nearly exclusively) de-caf Cappuccino - hence the Niche, as it is very easy to change settings between the two grinds (try that on a Mazzer...).

The main reason to move from the Pavoni is that my wife has, for years, tried and failed to make her own Cappuccino/Espresso - she just doesn't want to learn the intricacies of the diva. I'm happy to make one for her, but as I'm not always around, she is looking for a possible solution for herself.

I really like the thermoblock design of the Ascaso, and talking about design, its overall look really speaks to us (as well as its size, our kitchen is fairly small). 

Now on to the questions:

1. Is my understanding correct that the switch with 1/2 cups is basically just a switch with two different timers, i.e. I could use one setting for my beans, one for de-caf? 
2. Working with a very, very manual machine, I got quite good in creating consistently okayish coffee, but I have to regularly tweak the way I press on the lever, although the beans are always weighted and the grind settings (and tamping) are fairly consistent. Are you guys actually happy with the shot length you program, or do you have to change the settings on a regular basis, even if you use the same type of beans and grind settings? 
3. Even though the machine heats up pretty quickly, I would like to be able to remote start it with a smart power outlet. Obviously, this works perfectly for the Pavoni, but can the Ascaso be switched on and off with the power outlet? Any potentially negative effects?

As for the normal vs. Plus - I like the optic of the steam lever, and some of the accessories are pretty nice and I would buy them, anyway (bottomless portafilter). Any opinions comparing the two? 

Thanks for reading, looking forward to any answers/comments. And no, I'm not fixed on the Ascaso, feel free to comment if you think I would make a mistake and should look for something different.

It seems like a lot to pack.  Especially a bowl though I could just use a coffee mug or something.

1gn9ll7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1gn9ll7/a_week_full_of_surprises_ch_3/,A week full of surprises ch. 3 ,"The next morning, Stephen was once again woken by Kelly's voice echoing through the house. ""Stephen! Where's my breakfast in bed? And don’t forget to strain the juice; I don't want any pulp!"" she called impatiently.

He sighed, got up, rubbed the sleep from his eyes, and headed to the kitchen. Just as he was carrying the tray upstairs, Kelly's phone rang. She answered with a frown. ""Hello? Oh… today and tomorrow?"" Her face darkened. As she listened, she reached out for the tray, pulling it toward her, nodding. ""Yes, I understand, I'll be there soon. See you.""

Stephen stood somewhat lost by her bedside, waiting for a sign that he could leave. She looked at him with an irritated expression. ""It seems I have to work at the salon today and tomorrow,"" she said, clearly annoyed.

Stephen tried to nod sympathetically. ""It's too bad you have to give up your days off...""

Suddenly, Kelly smiled, an idea flashing in her mind. ""Well, I have you now, don’t I? We’ll just turn it into a positive experience!"" She laughed and took a sip of her coffee. ""Go pack your things; you’re coming along to help today.""

Stephen looked at her, puzzled. ""Help? At the beauty salon?""

""Yes, of course! I’m going to teach you everything we do there. It’s the perfect chance for you to get some practice!"" Her eyes sparkled mischievously as she took the last sip of her coffee.

Half an hour later, they arrived at the beauty salon, well before opening time. Kelly immediately walked over to her colleague and began animatedly talking about her weekend. Stephen stood a bit awkwardly beside them, shifting uncomfortably.

Kelly glanced at him and raised an eyebrow. ""Stephen, would you mind grabbing us some coffee? A little milk and sugar, please.""

""Oh, sure,"" he mumbled. Quickly, he went to the coffee machine and made two cups of coffee. As he returned, he overheard her laughing with her colleague.

""You're really lucky to have such a helpful... assistant,"" the colleague teased Kelly with a wink.

Kelly laughed. ""Yes, he’s a real sweetheart, though he still needs some training."" She gave Stephen a brief smile when he handed her the coffee but immediately resumed her conversation.

At exactly nine o'clock, Kelly looked at him with a serious expression. ""Alright, Stephen, time to get to work. Let's start with a thorough cleaning of the salon. The floor needs mopping, all mirrors should shine, and the towels must be perfectly folded in the cabinet."" She pointed to a cleaning cart and handed him a cloth. ""I’ll show you each step. Follow my instructions exactly.""

Stephen nodded and obediently began cleaning. Kelly watched him closely, sometimes tapping her heels on the floor if she thought his pace was too slow. ""No, no, that’s not how it’s done, Stephen. The cloth needs circular movements, understand?"" She took the cloth from his hand and made quick, perfect circles on the mirror.

He looked at her wide-eyed. ""Alright, I get it now, Kelly.""

""Good, then you can finish it yourself,"" she said with a smile, hands on her hips as she watched him.

By eleven o'clock, the doorbell chimed, and the first client walked in. A confident woman with bright red lipstick and high heels looked around and greeted Kelly warmly. ""Ah, Kelly! I'm so looking forward to my treatment today.""

Kelly nodded politely and glanced briefly at Stephen. ""Perfect timing. Stephen, I think you're ready to get some more experience. This lady will be your first client, but… I’ll do a quick test first."" She smiled mysteriously at the client. ""Let’s pretend I’m the client, so he’s perfectly trained for your appointment. Make yourself comfortable; I’ll be right back.""

She turned to Stephen. ""I want you to simulate a full treatment,"" she said in a businesslike tone. ""And remember, every step must be perfect. Start with a facial mask, followed by a head massage, then a pedicure, and a foot massage. Precision and care are essential. Every movement must be careful and patient, understood?""

Stephen nodded uncertainly. ""Yes, Kelly, I’ll do my best.""

Kelly leaned back, closed her eyes, and nodded approvingly as he gently applied the facial mask. ""Less pressure, Stephen; I’m not a wooden plank,"" she said. He adjusted his pressure, as she gave him strict guidance at each step.

After he finished the pedicure and began the hand massage, Kelly smiled slightly. ""Not bad for a beginner. Now you know exactly what’s expected."" She stood up, glanced at her colleague, and asked, “Do you think he's ready for the real thing?”

Kelly took a break around noon and left Stephen to clean the room once again. As he was putting the final touches on tidying up, her colleague smiled his way. ""Kelly, is it true he gives such good foot massages?""

Kelly burst out laughing and snapped her fingers to get Stephen's attention. ""Stephen, my colleague would love a foot massage from you. Come here, show her what you've learned!""

Stephen blushed and looked confused. He nodded politely, unsure of how to begin, as the colleague removed her shoes and extended her feet toward him.

""Come on, Stephen, go ahead,"" Kelly encouraged him. She pointed under the table, where he modestly began massaging, while her colleague nodded approvingly.

""Impressive!"" said the colleague with a smile, and Kelly looked at him with a proud expression.

The afternoon continued, and after each client, Kelly encouraged Stephen to clean and prepare the space for the next treatment. Clients tipped him for his help, but each time, Kelly took the money from his hands. ""Thank you, but this goes to me. After all, you're working for me, and I’m providing your training. Getting lessons from the best is not just a small thing,"" she said triumphantly, and Stephen smiled weakly as he nodded.

When the workday ended, they got in the car together. Kelly’s gaze drifted over the street, and she noticed a cozy little restaurant. ""You know, Stephen, I think you can treat me to dinner, given the valuable training I gave you today."" She laughed and steered toward the restaurant.

Stephen looked surprised. ""Uh, I... sure, I can do that.""

Inside, Kelly chose the best dish on the menu for herself and gave him a playful smile. ""For you, I think I'll pick something simple from the kids' menu, to keep the costs balanced.""

During the meal, Kelly visibly enjoyed herself while Stephen slowly ate his simple dish. When they were finished, Kelly leaned back, satisfied and content, and gave him a nod. ""Thanks for dinner, Stephen. I’m glad you appreciate my training.""

Once they got home, Kelly looked at the television and decided it was time to finish the movie from the previous night. She looked at Stephen, snapped her fingers, and pointed to her feet. He knew exactly what she meant and knelt beside the couch to give her a foot massage.

Halfway through the movie, Kelly's phone rang. She picked up and saw it was Imke. ""Hey, Imke! How’s it going?"" she asked cheerfully.

Imke smiled over the phone. ""Good! And how are things with you two? I hope Stephen is enjoying himself.""

""Oh, absolutely,"" Kelly replied breezily. ""We’re having a fantastic time, and Stephen is having the time of his life here. He’s learning so much and puts his whole heart into it.""

Imke laughed softly. ""Good to hear. Can I have a word with him?""

Kelly glanced at Stephen, who was busy with the massage. ""Hmm, that’s not possible right now, Imke. His hands are full with a very… pleasant activity."" She gave him a wink.

When the movie ended, Kelly gave a satisfied sigh. She looked at Stephen and said, ""I think I’ll need a real professional massage soon. We’ll practice that later.""

Stephen nodded, exhausted but obedient, and by midnight, they both went to bed. Kelly cast a final glance at a pile of dirty socks in the corner of the room and grinned.

""Ah, those socks can wait until tomorrow, right?"" she said with a mischievous smile. ""You’ll get used to the smell eventually."" She led him to the storage room, locked the door, and turned the key.

""Goodnight, Stephen. I’m sure you can’t wait to come along again tomorrow,"" she said with a laugh, already planning the next day in her mind.",2,1731157232.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False
1gn9lf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gn9lf0/caught_in_a_dilemmashould_i_text_her_after_one/,"Caught in a dilemma—should I text her after one meeting, or let fate decide?","**TL;DR:** I met a girl last week, had a great conversation, but I’m unsure how to continue the connection. Should I text her, ask her out directly, or wait for an upcoming event to approach her?

Hey everyone,

I (26M) met a girl (21F) last week at a university meetup. We had a solid 30-35 minute conversation about her research, career plans, etc. She was engaged, maintained eye contact, and laughed a few times, but I’m not sure if she was just being friendly or if there was some romantic interest.

After the meetup, we went to dinner with a group. We sat across from each other, but the conversation was mostly group-focused, though she kept looking in my direction. Afterward, we parted ways, and since then, I’ve been thinking about how to take things forward. It’s been a week, and I’ve discussed it with a few friends, but I’m getting mixed advice. Here are the options I’m considering:

**Option A: Start a casual conversation over text.**  
I could reference something we talked about, like her research, and gradually steer it toward a more personal conversation. My concern is that transitioning to personal topics might seem forced or desperate, especially since we haven’t texted much before (I posted about that meetup on a group we're in and she reached out asking for some details, just 2-3 messages). Any advice on how to start the conversation without it feeling awkward or forced?

**Option B: Ask her out directly over text.**  
I could just message her: “Hey, would you like to continue our conversation over coffee/lunch sometime?” This feels a bit more direct, but I’m worried it might seem too forward given our limited interaction.

**Option C: Wait for an upcoming event on campus.**  
There’s a big cultural event (200+ people) next week that she might attend, which may give me a chance to talk to her one-on-one (but it will be tricky given the crowd). Since we’re in different departments, it’s really the only natural opportunity to meet in person. However, if I wait, it will be almost two weeks since we met, which feels like a long time to wait without making a move.

I’m leaning towards **Option A**, as it feels less abrupt than **Option B** and gives me a chance to gauge her interest. If she attends the event (**Option C**), I could continue the conversation there if the opportunity arises. However, I’m unsure how to start the conversation in a way that feels natural and not desperate.

What do you think is the best approach? Any advice on how to phrase the first message or other suggestions would be really helpful! Thanks in advance!",1,1731157218.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

There's a girl who's so beyond my reach that it's amusing. I encounter her frequently – in UMSU, on campus, and occasionally at the gym – as if she’s a magnetic pull.

She’s stunning, but that’s not all. It’s how she appears so determined while studying, as if she’s on a quest to make a difference. Occasionally, she will share a laugh with her friends, and it's the most authentic, joyful sound in existence. I’m unsure of her name, her major, or what year she’s in, but I’m certain she’s absolutely perfect.

I’ve attempted to create reasons to approach her – feigning that I was lost just to inquire about directions, lingering next to her in the library wishing she'd see me, and even “accidentally” colliding with her once. She simply offered me a courteous smile and continued on, as if it were no big deal. Which, naturally, to her it wasn’t. Yet for me? It’s the best part of my week.

I get it, I get it – this seems sad, doesn’t it? And no, I’m not entitled to anything from her, nor does she owe me any of her time simply because I have my emotions. However, whenever I encounter her, it’s a combination of sheer admiration and complete exasperation because I'm aware it will never evolve beyond that. She’s following her unique journey, accomplishing remarkable things, while I’m simply… present. Being in the same location as her and feeling completely distressed about it.

I'm unsure if I'll ever converse with her, and even if I do, what would I say? “Hello, I’ve noticed you around 30 times, and you probably don’t realize it, but you’ve shattered every expectation I’ve ever had in a relationship.” ""Would you like to get coffee?"" It's a funny remark. She’s the sun, and I’m merely an asteroid drifting nearby, wishing for a touch of her glow.

Nonetheless, I appreciate you taking the time to read this if you did. I just needed to express my feelings because this girl is making me experience emotions I haven't felt in years, and I’m unsure how to cope with it.

Most are understandably squeamish, especially those with firm morals.

Yet I sort of feel like Lucanis being an assassin, who will kill anyone for a paid contract, was a little glanced over. I do understand that in a time of crisis, you need to pull what allies you have together, and a master assassin is an extremely good resource to have. So for being a part of the Veilguard, he's pivotal. But for being comfortable with him, friendly, filial, romantic, even... it feels a little odd, I suppose.

Considering all of the rest of the companions, they're very good morally-aligned characters (with Taash feeling more neutral). But Lucanis, along with the rest of the Crows, come from a knowingly messed-up system of an assassination guild, where his entire life has been murder. Bellara should be particularily disturbed considering she fights for the greater good and detests the devaluing of life. Harding maybe too, but she worked with Leliana and is used to that sort of thing by now.

I would have really enjoyed some more back-and-forths about trusting/being comfortable around Lucanis, especially with him having a literal demon inside him. He should be struggling with feeling isolated, which would make his personal quest hot harder.

# Saturday reading: Mini-decisions lead to maxi-decisions

Few relapses are intentional. The stated intent of all people trying to change is to take actions and to maintain their progress until they are free of their problem. But it is easy to fool ourselves. We may make any number of “mini-decisions” that ultimately have negative consequences… Some such decisions might include keeping binge foods in the house “in case company drops by” or deciding to go for coffee or a walk (healthy activities on their own) in a high-risk business or neighbourhood instead of doing the same thing in a safer place where you are less likely to run into high-risk people or things. It could mean falling behind in self care or deciding that you don’t necessarily need to make a plan for the next risk situation that is coming up.

Such mini-decisions can lead you to begin shifting away from maintenance and toward relapse. Before you know it, you may find that you’ve gone back to your old ways, never having made a conscious “maxi-decision” to relapse.

So I (F26) have a friend (M26) that I ended my friendship with. I was being dramatic and impulsive and I regret it, but I really don’t know how to start being friends again or even if I should try. I, unfortunately, tend to beat dead horses a lot in the pursuit of closure. 

So here's the short story of it: I became friends with (I'll call him) Matt pretty quickly after we met. We were good friends for a few months before we started flirting a bit. Friendly flirting, being closer, meeting for coffee, and giving gifts to one another. We weren't looking for relationships at the moment so we stayed as friends. 

Then I found out he was sleeping with one of our mutual friends (F27) and I got hurt and jealous. I felt sick, even though we weren't anything. So I abruptly asked if we could take some time apart and not talk for a while. I didn't explain myself very well because I was embarrassed, and I didn't want to sound crazy. 

It's been about a month since we stopped talking and I ran into him in public and we didn't say a word. And now I'm realizing that I would rather be friends than nothing at all. I sent him a text checking in on him and apologized for ending things without an explanation. He said it was fine but mostly just responded coldly, the conversation fizzled out immediately.

Do I try to reach out again? Apologize? Do I just leave things alone? I'm still hurt about him sleeping with her but I have come to the understanding that we aren't together and my feelings aren't valid. But I miss him. 

TLDR: I ended things with a friend because I got jealous and now I want to be friends again. ",1,1731156078.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

My life is difficult without it, but it make me sweat like a pig for absolutely no reason all the time.. 

The “gold standard” treatment for hyperhidrosis in my opinion is oxybutynin or any agent that is a centrally acting anticholingeric. Unfortunately hyperhidrosis isn’t a medical emergency so getting treatment for this is difficult and drawn out especially if you use a public health service. 

My secret? taking 25mg of diphenhydramine every morning. It does sedate you, but a coffee counteracts it. It stops the sweating as it is anticholinergic like oxybutynin, and is available everywhere. Oxybutynin requires blood monitoring and all sorts of nonsense. 

To sum it up: this drug works for sweating and I think if you’re in a spot similar to me where you just have to “live with it”, give it a go. It isn’t a cure but it is far better than all the strong antiperspirants they throw at you by a mile. 

Just my two cents. Happy sweating (or not I suppose).

If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, comment below or shoot me a DM, and we’ll try to work out a time that suits everyone!

Ralph is brushed every day so he gets used to it…… we now have 4 hoovers and an industrial strength Rug & Carpet cleaner! Berners really should be sponsored by Dyson!!

He is goofy and fun, and definitely needs his Human social & stimulation time on his own from the other 3 dogs (miniature dachshunds) as he really loves the attention, treats, challenges and learning new commands which he is picking up quickly!

He is getting used to getting out and about, but as an owner he is an introverts worst nightmare!! Cannot go anywhere without being stopped by everybody and made of fuss of! It took 40 mins to get a coffee as people just wanted to stoke, hug, cuddle and take photos - sadly not of me.

We have been amazed by his sense of smell and hearing, he can hear a carrot being cut from the bottom of the garden with the windows closed, and sniff out treats, goodies and my shoes in 2 seconds - we now use the coat racks to hang my shoes on….. 

I have been told that i have been waking up in the middle of the night shouting down / leave it / no or “on the mat not the rug”, hopefully this will get better….

We still have a few accidents in the house but these are getting less frequent.

He is growing and changing so quickly, and things that were safe last week are not this week! Let’s just hope he doesn’t learn how to open doors or we will be in real trouble!!

Looking forward to the next week / weeks /months when he starts puppy training and has his first outing to the Dog groomer, and more adventures!

I met this girl at a sort of workplace environment and we hit it off pretty early on. We exchanged numbers and snaps, a few weeks of texting and out of the blue she one day asks me to get coffee with her. I do this, we have a good time. Since then we've been stuck to each other, we text all the time, at our work we're always together, I've treated her to dinner, I've had her stay the night at my place a few times, we would give each other back/neck massages, we even slept in the same bed once. I even drove her two hours for a work trip so we had a bit of a roadtrip together.

After all this the other week she calls me up all depressed and she reveals that she broke up with a guy she was dating. Apparently she started dating this guy shortly after hanging out with me and never once told me about him. This dude was really awful to her, he made her drive five hours to go see him just to dump her as a joke. And she called me to vent about this. My immediate reaction was questioning why she never told me that she had a boyfriend while we were doing all this stuff together and she reveals that she never saw me like that and only saw me as a friend which just boggled my mind. I told her multiple times how much I liked her and she said she thought I was joking every single time. And things got a little heated. She said she didn't like my personality and I had to mention how she chose a guy who literally stranded her five hours from her home over me and this really pissed her off. She said I was implying that she makes bad decisions and that she didn't realize the guy was like that. After this she cut contact, blocked me on my phone and on Snap. I've honestly been pondering this whole situation and I genuinely can't tell if I screwed up or not. I'm even thinking of apologizing for ruining the friendship but my buddies tell me I did nothing wrong. Was wondering what you guys think?",5,1731155031.0,AITA_Relationships,4,0.86,False

I'm looking for advice on my first setup, with a primary goal of watching series/movies.  
I have a 2000€ budget for projector + screen.

At first, I wanted to go for the Hisence C1 which is praised nearly everywhere.  
However, I don't think it'll fit correctly in my room due to the throw distance.  
The room is 3.8m. Couch on one side, screen expected on the other side, so nearly 3.3/3.5m seating distance.  
I wanted a 254cm max screen size (100""). 

I have 2 options to place the projector :

* Above the couch, on a shelf. It means it'll have 3.4m of throw distance. With the Hisence C1, it means a 325cm image. Too much. 
* On the coffee table, in front of the couch. It'll then be at around 2.2m of the screen (can be adapted a bit), but tilted up. The Hisence will then display a 210cm image size.

The shelf option would be the cleanest, without any alignment correction, but if I go for this, I need to find another projector.  
The coffee table option means that I need to ""setup"" the projector every time. And I don't know how much the screen correction will affect quality.

I'm looking for other projectors, maybe the BenQ TK710, but even this one will end up with a 260cm image size with a 3.4m throw distance. A bit bigger than 100"". So I don't know what is my best move here, and if I can keep looking for this ""shelf setup"".  
If any of you have some experience on this kind of dilemna, I'll take any help here !

Frank is a 53 year old white man from Jersey. Whatever you are probably thinking is probably right. A cup of Drunken Donuts coffee in each hand every morning, as bald as the day is long, and a permanent scowl on his face. Just looking at him and hearing him being able to shout from one end of our warehouse to the other would probably make you think he would be the worst person in the world to work for and I totally understand that.

When I first came over to the warehouse I was one of two ""women"". The only non-straight and I am also Non-binary. They guys don't give a shit. Frank doesn't give a shit. I mean, he doesn't understand the non-binary thing and told he wasn't going to use They/Them but in the same breath went ""but maybe I just don't understand. Maybe I should sit down and actually talk with my niece about it."" Turns out he has a niece(I'm so sorry, I don't know a non gendered term for niece/nephew) who is also non binary. At the time, they were the only NB he knew. Now I waltz in acting like everyone else in the warehouse and he can see past the idiots and lies and is rethinking things.

Frank has been which this company for 20+ years. Probably drove a forklift during his birth which how good he is on them. Standard, 10k, 15k, combine, Versalift, Bendi, 20k, you name it Frank can ""pick your teeth"" with it as he likes to say.

But do you know the thing that surprised me the most?? He actually cares for our safety. Sick? Get the fuck down don't come back till your better. (But text him when you get home so he knows your okay) NOT THAT HE CARES OR ANYTHING!!! Late for work? Text or call him so he knows your okay. (There was a guy who was late, hadn't been heard from in hours. By the time someone got into contact with him they found out he got into an accident on the way to work and was in the hospital.) He helped a new guy change the propane for the forklift cause they were having issues. Turns out there was a leak and when he got it disconnected, he got propane sprayed all over his hand. Absolutely unacceptable, immediately bought propane gloves for the forklifts once he found out they had been stolen and no one but him was allowed to change the propane until they came in.

Another new guy, kind of a hot head who didn't like being told what to do, knocked over a bollard blocking the path into our break area then two weeks later ran into a roll door with the forklift. Frank felt he was a safety hazard so he was fired.

We now have a total of 5 women on our team and they get treated like everyone else. D, the other lady on my team, got bit by a spider yesterday and Frank wasn't on site. When he found out he made sure she was safe and okay to work cause they gave her Benadryl.

I could literally go on but this post is long enough and it's turned into some kind of weird rant. If Frank read this he'd ""Baaah!!"" At me and shoo me away then shout ""Love yous!!!"" As he walked away.",28,1731154802.0,BlueCollarWomen,5,0.98,False
1gn8vkw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gn8vkw,E-reading in an library ,"Good Saturday reading Kobo fam.

Mainly I read before sleeping in bed, or ad home chilling. But occasionally I take my Kobo with me to an coffee bar or an Starbucks to enjoy barista coffee and the setting during my read. 

But mostly I like to take my Kobo with me to the Library. However it feels a bit odd to bring an E-reader to an library. Is this just me? The Library near my home has been grand awarded being the best library in the world (2018) and has an amazing view’s reading, study spots and an reading cafe (their coffee could be an improvement point, but it isn’t to bad). So the personal feeling of awkwardness bringing my own books to an library never prevented me doing this.

It’s just they have so many books available and I am taking my books to the library. I never see anyone doing this. Funny times we are living in. Can you relate?",48,1731154735.0,kobo,3,0.96,False

“I don’t know if people really know what it is to love someone.” 


Then I thought, “how could they? Most people don’t love themselves.” 


It was an obnoxious thought. It’s presumptive. But… it might be true. When you look  in the mirror, do you get butterflies? Do you love the scars, and the smile lines? Do you admire the way your eyes reflect the light? Do you want to laugh because the person in the mirror thinks this is so ridiculous but honestly good? 


How do you love yourself? Do you love yourself? Do you know what you enjoy? Do you know what makes you happy? What is worthy of the person in the mirrors happiness and how far would you go and what would you work towards to make you happy? Because when you love someone, the journey is never far, too long, or difficult. 


Do you love you? If not… how could you know what love is? And how could you love another? 



Love yourself, you don’t snore when you sleep, you cook and buy food for you, when you’re tired you take yourself to bed, and when you need coffee you get it for yourself?when you want to go out, you take yourself out. Sometimes you bring friends but they aren’t necessary for you to have a good time, you have you and that’s enough. 



“I know how to love you, because I know how I hurt.” 


I wrote that when thinking about mars, because she was a part of me. The greatest part that was just walking around, laughing, talking, drinking wine, and doing witchy things. She was free in a way I could never be, and she saw me and saw herself.  She could love me because she knew how she hurt as well. 


People like that don’t come around often. So Know yourself, love yourself, and in the end, you’ll know how to love them and be worthy of the love they have for you.

I keep trying to daydream how I would take him to the side, go right up to him real close! And tell him annoyingly how this tension is driving me crazy, how he says “the girl he’s seeing” is either to make me jealous or what but, why can’t you just call her your gf! Why does he say that to me when he knows I like him!…. We’re both seeing other people, I get it. I am too, not going to wait around for you, and if you loose me it’s YOUR lossss! 

It’s obvious you are not in a committed relationship with her, it’s causal and stuff…. Hence why you ain’t saying my gf…. And that’s fine, so am I! The guy I’m seeing looks like Damon salvatore like the hottest f vampire going! But still, I like you! Idk what to do about my feelings for you! Arghhhh! 

Honestly I asked you to spend lunch with me and you agreed. 

Why would you agree if you didn’t like me? And literally have someone else in your life and you know I like you and yet you said sure…..argh! 

Also it’s clearly obvious you like me, you always look at me and look away, or we look at eachother for ages intensely….i don’t want to play these games though!!! 

Anyways…. My guy is driving me crazy, as much as I want to get over him I can’t! 

Also drop the formality and talking so formal with me 🙄

Listen Leon! Idc if you even on Reddit! But get the damn courage to confess your feelings to me! Like 🤦🏻‍♀️ it’s clearly obvious to everyone at work now, that I like you, or we have something going on…. Everyone can see it and feel it. It’s f awks! 

And I’m not a fricking option, I’m the one! So like just tell me how it is. Or stop looking at me! And initiating convos if you going to keep going cold on me. Don’t ask me for my posh coffee and to make it together, randomly 😒

Literally don’t care if he’s going to see this or not, doubtttttt it. Got real brave writing this and posting it. Not like I can talk to him about any of this anyways💀",1,1731154625.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I'm on a journey to get a better health since jully this years. I did HIIT workout, walking, follow along calithenics on youtube.
But for about 3 week now, I do bodyweight training 3x a week and running on the threadmill 3x a week and then I have a rest day.

My stress level are always through the roof, some days I get 2 mins of rest. I don't feel stressed so I don't really get why. All my nights are crappy sleep because of my stress level. I eat mostly well, I don't drink, take 2 coffee in the morning and that's it.

Is it because my journey is still ""young""?",2,1731154405.0,Garmin,2,1.0,False

Yesterday morning my landlord and an exterminator came by for a pest problem we've been having. He's been by two other times and both times it has fallen to me to adjust my schedule, coordinate, and be in the apartment to mind the cat while bait / spray or whatever is being applied. This time, they asked that all the cupboards and cabinets adjacent the wet wall in the building be removed. The night before I was working my second job and it went much later than expected. My wife had a friend over for the night and was texting asking if I wanted to empty those things together when I got home, to which I replied I would just get up and do it early in the morning, as I needed to eat after my shift and was exhausted from also working my day job. By the time I got home she was in bed anyway - nothing had been removed from the cabinets (this is fine, as I'd said I'd deal with it knowing she had a friend over). 

I wake up in the morning and empty all of the cupboards. Her friend is over and they are in the living room, and she keeps coming in offering ""suggestions"" on how to empty the cabinets and cupboards and I'm like hey I got this, just go be with your friend and the kitchen is honestly too small for us to work on this together anyway and the stuff is just gonna go right back in later. She and her friend go for coffee before my landlord shows up. They end up spraying an insecticide that I had to keep the cat away from for 1 hour at minimum -- she is an older cat so we are both worried a bit and agree that if I can keep her away from the treated areas for two hours that would be best. So, I end up cancelling my plans to volunteer at the neighborhood food pantry to deal with this while she is at coffee with her friend, doing a little bit of billing work but mostly gaming, for several hours. I head into work at my day job after this and then she comes home and games for the afternoon. 

I get home that evening and we have a relationship check-in which goes pretty well. She requested pizza and brussels sprouts for dinner and I ask if she could prep the brussels sprouts to make it a little easier on me since I am feeling a little worn down. She says she doesnt have the energy to prep the vegetables. So, I end up prepping the veggies (wouldve gone to waste if not) and cooking everything while she is putting stuff back in the cabinets (about 5% of the things put back all day while I was at work).  Once I have a moment, I go to leave and she asks for me to help putting the things away - so I do. She goes and sits back down in the living room while I finish cooking and get everything ready to serve up. I say hey food is ready, and she comes in and starts making up her plate. 

As we are walking out to go sit down in the living room for our meal, she sees 6 items in the sink from that am that I had left (because I could not put them away during the insecticide treatment). Because I am feeling petty I will tell you it was 2 glasses, 2 mugs, a funnel, and a small french press. 

She then says ""so these are all your dishes? Do you expect me to wash them on top of cleaning up from dinner? You know I don't like to be treated like a housewife."" I snap at her, which was wrong, but I just pointedly (we dont yell or name call or anything) ask her ""seriously? when I have I ever treated you like a housewife? Also, by the way, it would be completely fair for you to just wash those things in addition to cleaning up the dinner I just made for us considering how much work I've put in around the house today."" Back and forth ensues, am I 'expecting' her to do them this and that and Im like just dont do them, just dont even worry about it, but don't accuse me of treating you like a housewife because that has never been true. 

Anyway she keeps pressing me as Im trying to just sit down and eat and starts asking me if my snapping at her is a product of my trauma (? another sort of issue. she is a counselor and absolutely fixated on how trauma informs everyone's actions all the time), she doesnt deserve that, and no she wont be washing my dishes because she doesnt want to ""reward my bad behavior by giving me what I want"". I honestly am so frustrated at this point and basically say something to the effect that this doesn't feel like teamwork at all and whatever hang up she has about not being a housewife isnt fair to put on me cause I have never ever treated her like that - ever. So then she tells me basically I dont clean up fast enough or whatever and it makes her feel like she should be doing it (she never does and I never demand it, but sure, I left my dishes that day and am generally more cluttered than her but I am very clean and do my fair part).  She storms out and tells me shes not talking to me - then comes in later and I apologize for snapping and losing my temper, explaining I was frustrated, tired, and hungry, and I was hurt by her comment. She accepts my apology and I ask - do you have anything on your end you'd apologize for? And she then calls me defensive which triggers me again and Im just like okay we are not doing this. Also, you're welcome for dinner (she never said thank you). Anger ensues. She does all the dishes except my 6 items and goes in the bedroom to watch reality TV. 

Let me just provide a little context that over the years she is reluctant to cook and clean around the house unless one of her friends is coming over. In fact, the night prior, when I was working late - she cooked an entire meal for her and her friend, didnt save me any, and all her shit was in the drying rack the next morning which is part of why I didnt clean the six accursed items that were still there that evening. Anyway, I feel like it is a double standard and unfair of her to put her fears of being a housewife on me constantly. She never cleans the toilet (it will be filthy if I dont and then I have to be the one to do it because she doesnt like to, it makes her feel like a housewife), she continues to place smelly trash bags outside the apartment door even though I have expressed multiple times I find it gross and would prefer she jsut take the trash down to the bins instead of leaving it in the hall all day for me to take out, etc etc. Idk, obviously some building resentment here but my words fall on deaf ears a lot of the time or I end up getting invalidated and it makes me pretty upset..

  
Idk, first time posting here - I hope any of that made sense. 

TL;DR - I did majority of the household responsibilities for the day, cooked a nice meal, and got accused of wanting my wife to be a housewife and clean up my 6 dishes from the morning before we could even eat said dinner because she felt they should have been done sooner (couldn't have because the kitchen was basically dismantled).
