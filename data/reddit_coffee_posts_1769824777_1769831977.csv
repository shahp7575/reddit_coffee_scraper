1qrrw1z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qrrw1z,🚨 NEW RESTOCK MENU ANNOUNCEMENT 🚨,"Alright Chaos Crew, buckle up 😈
📅 Monday, February 10th
⏰ 7:00 PM CST

So here’s the tea… I had way too many ideas for this restock and absolutely could not narrow it down to just one or two themes. Decision paralysis? Moi?? Always.
So instead of choosing, I said why not all three?

Enter: Ménage à Trois
Yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like — three themes, one restock, very cheeky dad-joke energy. You’re welcome 😌

💘 Valentine’s Day
Ghosted – Thermochromatic gummy clear shifting dark grey ➝ white with heat. Scented eucalyptus, spearmint, lavender, and driftwood for emotionally unavailable calm.
Date at the Art Museum – Pulp texture with a random framed painting charm, scented like paper, polish, and quiet judgment.

🎭 Mardi Gras
King Cake – Last year’s bestseller! Tofu DIY packed with festive bakery goodness and scented just like the real thing.
Coffee & Beignets at Café du Monde – DIY cream jelly scented café au lait and powdered sugar dreams.

1qrrrhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriting/comments/1qrrrhb/unsafe_passage/,Unsafe Passage,"Eighteen miles off the cape, we spot a schooner bearing west, flying the green skull pennant of Commodore Savings & Loan.

We fire a cannon in the other direction, and run up our own colors, showing friendly.

“Invite her captain to breakfast,” I say, walking into my cabin.

“The whole coast has surrendered,” says the captain, ramming down his meal. Pan-fried anchovies and beer.

“Surrendered to who?” I say.

“One of the tribal lords. T’Kuhmsa, I think.” His eyes are hollow and bloodshot.

I shoot a secret glare to my steward, Mrs. Fielding. She nods to the brewing kettle and shrugs with barely-concealed insolence.

But my guest is distracted, remote. He finishes two more glasses of wine and slumps back into his chair. I get the feeling he doesn’t care whether the gold his schooner carries is captured or sunk, so long as he’s allowed to sleep.

“Where’s your escort?” I ask.

“Burned to the water before we ever left the Sound. It wasn’t pirates. Someone dropped a candle in her powder-room.”

Through the bulkhead come the working sounds of our sloop, muffled hammering, chisels clanking. At first he winces, like his head can’t take the noise. But then his eyes open, curious at the sound and struggling to wake some part of his brain that might recognize it.

“You’re a scientific vessel,” he says in a tone that can’t be distinguished as either a statement or question.

Our conversation is cut short by the lookout’s hail: “Land ho!”

I frown. We’re not sailing at the moment; if the cape has come into view that means the inshore tide is pulling with uncommon strength.

“You’d best sail in line with us, sir,” I tell him.

Back on deck, my nostrils start burning, the rising sun veiled by a black haze in the east.

I check my pocket watch, impatient while the schooner’s captain stumbles to the rail and his waiting rowboat. As he turns to climb down the ladder, he sees our crew chipping cannonballs, smoothing imperfections and wiping them clean with studiously-plied rags.

Once again he seems curious, perturbed. But then our sloop gives sharp roll and he slips, falling back into the bottom of his boat. As he’s rowed back to the schooner, he leans over the side and vomits.

Mrs. Fielding brings my coffee and cigar case from the cabin. “Pass the word for Mr. Blythe,” I say.

My first mate appears, breathing hard, covered in sweat, tar, and rope burns. But he’s smiling.

“I’ll answer for that new topmast, anywhere this side of the Horn,” he says. He nods to the schooner, rising and falling alongside us.  “Shall I pass them a line, sir?”

South we run, both vessels fighting the tide as it threatens to pull us closer against hostile shores. More sails begin dotting the sea around us, merchants, trawlers, transports, all manner of craft fleeing T’Kuhmsa’s raid in one direction or another.

One of them, a large whaler, hails us and backs her sails. The sailing master asks why we’re standing in for the cape, particularly with a banking vessel in tow, while the coastline falls to pieces.

“You may as well hand that gold to the pirates,” he says. Independent corsairs paid by T’Kuhmsa are plying up and down the channel, ready to snatch up any ships of value. There’s been no sign of the heavy frigates sent by General Campbell to protect us.

With a resounding thump, my crew runs out the full line of cannons along our starboard side. A dozen eighteen-pounders ready to fire point-blank in the whaler’s hull. The friendly flag at our masthead comes racing down, replaced by the dreaded crossed-hatchet banner.

I give the master an apologetic glance. He’s quicker than the schooner’s captain, and grim understanding washes over his features.

LO is very hot and cold, texting daily for 5 months, LO then suggested coffee, after coffee, texting stopped, LO stopped texting back. Then went to an event with LO and had lunch after 4 months after coffee.

I Do multiple mental health events per year including conferences throughout the country. I feel like I go to see LO because she’s there too, I went once to the conference before the daily talking and she ignored me when I talked to her. Months later is when we got closer and got coffee, lunch etc. really confused.

Been in therapy twice a week for two years trying to get over this episode. Suicidal thoughts everyday because of severe depression.

She has severe mental health issues as well.

hey guys, we need your help.

carlos is a father of three. he's a husband and the dad of a student at one of our public schools here in seattle.

when we saw teachers stepping in to help their student's family, we felt it deeply. teachers already carry so much. they shouldn't have to carry this alone.

carlos came to this country seeking safety. he followed every rule and went to every check-in. in november, after a routine asylum appointment, carlos was detained. he's now being held at the northwest detention center in tacoma, separated from his kids.

unfortunately, what's happening to carlos isn't rare. we're seeing it across the country - from minneapolis to right here in seattle. families are living in fear.

in seattle, we've seeing small businesses step up. some closing in solidarity. others donating a percentage of their sales because closing their doors during the slow season isn't an option.

this is not about politics. this is about humanity.

we're committing to match up to $1,000 of donations to help carlos and his family.

this is local. this is real.

Decade long history of severe bloating. Having some questions…,"I’m in Bali and got the infamous “Bali Belly” twice within 3 weeks (vomiting diarrhea nausea and acid reflux). The second time the acid reflux was INSANE. I got some medications and was already worried, cause my gut is really fucked up.

mostly insane bloating, also on my upper belly, not just lower, independently of what I eat. It gets a bit better while fasting and also improved a bit on a keto diet but I found no long term relief. I always suspected SIBO however never tested for it.

A few days later, dark blood in my stool and feeling very weak. I went to a health clinic and they took it very seriously, drove me to the ER of a hospital where I stayed for 4 nights, got colonoscopy and endoscopy plus testing for H pylori (no results yet). 3 stomach ulcers were found.

I got prescribed 3 medications.

I will take then of course because I don’t want to risk it, but was a bit surprised about the acid reducer because I’ve never had acid reflux before and believe to have LOW stomach acid if anything, because my bile flow is inhibited because of a clogged liver (knowing this cause I’ve been doing liver flushes and big stones came out). I’ve heard of other people being prescribed acid reducers when in fact they needed MORE stomach acid and it fucked them up long-term. So I’m a bit worried this may just make it worse?

I’ve never had any stomach pain as others here in the group, my biggest issue was always the severe bloating and low energy/fatigue.

I also want to change my diet to the best of my abilities and really stick with it. Apart from the typical “no fried food, no junk food, no spicy, ideally no coffee” (the clinic also says no raw food for two weeks), is there anything else I should definitely avoid? The contradicting school of thoughts on food groups, diets etc gets me very confused.

Lastly, my assumption is the ulcers where there since some time and the Bali belly/acid reflux were just the last thing needed to make them bleed. So I guess it’s a good thing this happened because I would’ve not gotten a colonoscopy myself just like that.

Edit:

\- im a big coffee lover- not in terms of quantities but I love a good cappuccino a day- and will stop drinking coffee. Will matcha be ok though?

\- I’ve been on ADHD medication as well as a tiny dose of Cymbalta which the latter I’m convinced has heavily impacted many of my health issues. I guess it’s best to come off of both asap?

1qrrdt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenLevelingUp/comments/1qrrdt8/how_to_be_disgustingly_articulate_the/,How to Be Disgustingly Articulate: The Science-Based Playbook That Actually Works,"I used to sound like a complete idiot whenever I opened my mouth. Not because I lacked ideas, but because my brain would short circuit the moment I tried to express them. Words would tumble out in the wrong order, I'd trail off mid sentence, or I'd just freeze completely. Watching confident people speak felt like watching magic.

Here's what nobody tells you though. Being articulate isn't some innate gift you're born with. It's a skill you build through specific practices, and the science backs this up. I've spent hundreds of hours consuming content from communication experts, linguists, podcasts, research papers, and honestly some weird rabbit holes on YouTube. What I found was that most people struggle with articulation because of a few fixable issues: scattered thinking, limited vocabulary exposure, and zero practice speaking out loud. The good news is these are all trainable.

**The first shift is reading more, but strategically.** Most people skim articles and scroll social media, which trains your brain for fragmented thinking. Instead, read books that challenge your language processing. **Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss** (former FBI hostage negotiator, bestselling author) completely changed how I structure persuasive communication. Voss breaks down the psychology behind influential speech patterns and teaches tactical empathy, which is basically the art of making people feel heard while steering conversations. This book will make you question everything you thought you knew about effective communication. The techniques are insanely practical like mirroring, labeling emotions, and calibrated questions that I started using them immediately in everyday conversations. Around 60 pages in, I realized I'd been communicating like a caveman my entire life.

**Thinking out loud is the next game changer.** Your brain needs repetition to wire new pathways for verbal expression. Start narrating your thoughts when you're alone. Describe what you're doing, explain concepts to an imaginary person, argue both sides of an issue. It feels ridiculous at first but this is literally how your brain learns to organize thoughts into coherent speech. I do this while cooking, driving, even in the shower. The goal is to eliminate that gap between thought and articulation.

**Expand your vocabulary through context, not memorization.** Download something like **Readlr** for bite sized articles across different topics, or honestly just follow accounts that share interesting long form content. When you encounter unfamiliar words, don't just look up the definition. See how they're used in multiple contexts. Your brain learns through pattern recognition, not rote memorization. I also got weirdly into etymology, understanding word origins makes them stick better and helps you use them accurately.

**Record yourself speaking about random topics for 2 minutes without stopping.** Pick literally anything. How coffee is made. Why you prefer dogs over cats. The plot of the last show you watched. Play it back and note where you stumble, use filler words, or lose coherence. It's uncomfortable as hell but you'll improve drastically within weeks. This exercise forces you to think on your feet and builds that muscle memory for smooth delivery.

**Listen to articulate speakers obsessively.** I'm talking podcasts, lectures, interviews. **The Jordan Harbinger Show** features guests who are masters of their fields and the conversations demonstrate high level articulation across different contexts. Pay attention to how guests structure their responses, how they use pauses, how they bridge between ideas. Your brain absorbs speech patterns subconsciously through exposure.

If you want a more structured approach to this, **BeFreed** is an AI learning app that creates personalized podcasts and learning plans based on whatever communication goal you set, like ""become more articulate in high-pressure conversations"" or ""master persuasive language as an introvert."" It pulls from communication books, linguistic research, and expert interviews to build content that fits your exact needs.

You control the depth too. Start with a 10-minute overview of rhetorical techniques, and if it clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and breakdowns. The voice options are genuinely addictive, from a deep, smoky tone like Samantha in Her to more energetic styles that keep you locked in during commutes. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it makes the whole learning process way less dry and more like having an actual conversation about ideas that matter to you.

**Practice the PREP framework for structuring thoughts.** Point, Reason, Example, Point. Make your main statement, explain why, give a concrete example, then restate your point. This structure keeps you from rambling and gives your speech a natural flow. I use this constantly now, even in casual conversations, and people actually listen instead of zoning out.

**Slow down deliberately.** Most inarticulate speech comes from your mouth trying to keep pace with your racing thoughts. Speak 20% slower than feels natural. Use pauses strategically. Silence isn't awkward, it's powerful. It gives you time to formulate and gives listeners time to process.

The transformation doesn't happen overnight but it compounds quickly. After a few months of deliberate practice, you'll notice people leaning in when you speak, asking follow up questions, actually remembering what you said. Your thoughts will translate to words with way less friction. You'll stop feeling like there's this intelligent person trapped inside who can't communicate properly.

Start with one practice today. Read one chapter of a challenging book. Record yourself speaking for 2 minutes. Your future self will thank you for building this skill now.",1,1769830471.0,MenLevelingUp,0,1.0,False

However, in recent months, hatred for both Israel and let’s just say, its inhabitants’ views and attitudes towards some things, has skyrocketed. I’ve actually been surprised to see a grouping of countries so quickly wake up and smell the correct coffee on an issue the likes of which entire countries have tried to lie about and obfuscate. 

So, I ask, what do you all believe actually happened down in Patagonia? The many videos of Israeli tourists lighting small fires, boldly smoking cigarettes, claiming them to be nothing more than innocent backpackers. 

When it comes to the reasoning - a friend of mine who works down here in independent journalism has heard rumours that not only are large swathes of the land being burned to buy it up cheap, but soon there are plans to enact further damage to it though biological or toxicological means, and once the land is essentially unusable - they have two bargaining chips: 

1. An Argentine president so up Israel’s backside that it would shock me little, if at all, that he’s already had his Metzitzah B’peh done and a star on David tattooed on the now exposed tip. An Argentine president who thinks himself Jewish by wearing a musty Kippah and crying at the wall - and so is ripe for (as well as Argentine elites being extorted) emotional backmail that Israel will push for Patagonia  - Argentinas history of harbouring Nazis who fled along the rat lines after the war. 

Again I don’t know if the above is true - it’s just hearsay close the journalism ground here. But curious to see what people here say. 

All I will say is that Israel normally needs heavy and intensely tentacled, complex tactics to get what it wants, but in Argentina they essentially have a president who will kiss their feet first. 

We already have Israel’s national water company, Mekorot, expanding rapidly in Argentina in recent years. A useful tool in land development. 

So - is it after Patagonia? Why? How? ",2,1769830336.0,conspiracy,1,0.75,False

Like, you meet them once and suddenly you're telling your friends about them three weeks later. Meanwhile, most dates feel like automated job interviews where both people are reading from the same boring script.

I got curious about this after going on what felt like my 50th forgettable coffee date. So I went deep: researched attachment theory, watched hours of Matthew Hussey's content, read behavioral psychology studies, listened to relationship podcasts until my Spotify wrapped was embarrassing. Turns out, being memorable isn't about being the loudest or funniest person in the room. It's way more nuanced than that.

Here's what actually moves the needle:

**Stop performing, start connecting**

Most people treat dates like auditions. They rehearse stories, plan jokes, curate this perfect version of themselves. But here's the thing: people don't remember perfect. They remember real. Psychologist Arthur Aron's research on interpersonal closeness shows that vulnerability and authentic self disclosure creates way more connection than impressive achievements ever could.

Matthew Hussey talks about this concept of ""generous listening"" in his work. It's not just nodding while planning your next witty comeback. It's actually being present enough to catch the subtle things, the half mentioned detail about their childhood dog, the way their energy shifts when they talk about their job. That's where real conversation lives.

Try this: when they finish talking, pause for like two seconds before responding. Sounds weird but it signals you're actually processing what they said instead of just waiting for your turn to speak. Game changer.

**Become genuinely curious about their inner world**

Generic questions get generic answers. ""What do you do?"" leads to the same rehearsed elevator pitch they've given 47 times. Instead, the podcast ""Where Should We Begin"" with Esther Perel completely changed how I think about questions. She goes deep fast, not through invasive questions but through genuine curiosity about someone's perspective.

Ask things like ""what's something you believed as a kid that you don't anymore?"" or ""what's the best decision you made last year?"" These aren't interview questions. They're invitations into someone's actual thoughts. And when they answer, follow the thread. Don't just jump to your version of the story. Stay in theirs for a bit.

The book ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller breaks down how different attachment styles show up in early dating. Understanding this helps you read between the lines when someone talks about past relationships or their relationship with family. You start picking up on the deeper patterns instead of just the surface story.

**Create a sensory experience they'll remember**

Memory research shows our brains tag experiences with sensory details. That's why a certain song can transport you back to a specific moment years later. So don't just meet at the same generic bar everyone uses.

Take them somewhere with a specific vibe. A bookstore with a weird rare book section. A neighborhood they've never explored. A place that serves food they've mentioned wanting to try. The specificity is what matters. It signals you were paying attention and you put actual thought into this.

Dr. Helen Fisher's neuroscience research on attraction shows that novel experiences literally trigger dopamine production. Your brain chemistry shifts when you're doing something new. That rush gets associated with the person you're with. So yeah, mini golf might seem cheesy but it works because it's different.

**Master the art of playful tension**

This isn't about playing games or being manipulative. It's about creating that electric back and forth that makes conversation fun. Matthew Hussey calls it ""collaborative play"" where you're building something together in real time through banter and light teasing.

But here's the key: it has to come from genuine affection, not from trying to seem cool or aloof. There's a massive difference between playful challenge and just being mean. One creates chemistry, the other creates distance.

The book ""Models"" by Mark Manson has this insanely good breakdown of how attraction actually works versus how we think it works. Spoiler: being agreeable and nice all the time doesn't create attraction. Having a perspective and being willing to disagree playfully does. It shows you're comfortable in your own skin.

**Be specific with your compliments**

""You're beautiful"" lands flat because they've heard it a thousand times. ""I love how your whole face changes when you talk about your sister"" hits different because it's specific and shows you're paying attention to details beyond the surface.

Relationship researcher John Gottman's work shows that specific positive observations create way more connection than generic praise. Your brain knows the difference between autopilot compliments and ones that required actual observation.

**End on a high note and follow through**

Don't drag the date out until you've exhausted all possible conversation topics. Leave when things are still good. It creates anticipation instead of exhaustion. And then, and this seems obvious but people mess it up constantly, actually follow up.

If you want to go deeper into dating psychology without spending weeks reading every book and study, there's BeFreed. It's an AI learning app built by Columbia grads that turns relationship books, expert talks, and research into personalized audio learning. 

You just tell it your goal, like ""become more magnetic on dates as an introvert,"" and it pulls insights from dating experts like Esther Perel, Matthew Hussey, and books like Attached or Models to create a custom learning plan just for you. The depth is adjustable too, quick 10-minute summaries when you're busy or 40-minute deep dives with real examples when you want details. Plus you can pick voices that actually keep you engaged, even a smoky one that sounds like Scarlett Johansson. Makes the commute or gym time way more productive than doomscrolling.

Send a text referencing something specific from your conversation. Not ""had a great time"" but ""still thinking about what you said about your year in Berlin, would love to hear more about that."" It proves you were actually listening and you're interested in the continuation of the conversation, not just the date itself.

Look, being unforgettable isn't about being perfect or having the most interesting life. It's about being present enough to create a genuine moment with another person. Most people are so caught up in managing their own anxiety and image that they forget the whole point is connection. When you shift your focus from ""am I impressive enough"" to ""am I actually seeing this person,"" everything changes.

1qrraiv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qrraiv,I made the 150 hour chocolate cake. I have questions.,"Hi all! Long time lurker/admirer of bakers, first time poster.

A couple of weeks ago, u/bezalil posted this cake and I thought it would be fun to give it a shot. Last week I knew I'd be stuck in the house for several days due to the impending ice storm, so I bought the ingredients and tried my hand at it. Sorry this is so long; apparently I don't know how to talk about baking without using a lot of words.

I don't really consider myself a baker. The most complicated desserts I've made were an orange chocolate tart and a lemon roulade cake, both from the Great British Bakeoff Masterclass. Other than that, it's pretty much been cookies and a couple of pies. I thought this cake recipe sounded like a fun challenge at my level - no difficult techniques, just a bunch of steps.

I tried my best to copy the recipe exactly. The one thing I changed was I baked the cakes as soon as I mixed the batter. The general consensus on this step seemed to be that cakes won't rise if you leave them in the fridge overnight; I wanted fluffy cake so I just baked them right away. Despite this, they still didn't really rise. They're not as compact as the cakes in the videos, but they definitely didn't rise as I expected.

**My questions** (most of them have to do with the butter-infused bourbon, lol):

1. When I the filtered the butter out of the bourbon, there was what I call brown butter ""sludge"" left behind. Was I supposed to add this into the butter pan or toss it? Nobody talks about this. I did see that David Seymour included it in his video, so I did as well.
2. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup of bourbon. After the bourbon was filtered, there was 1/4 cup left. I wasn't sure if I should add more bourbon to get it back up to 1/2 cup, but I figured it was common sense that you're going to lose some liquid when infusing/straining and if I was supposed to top it off after straining, the recipe would say that. So I didn't top off the bourbon. Was this the right call?
3. Whyyyyy the infusion at all? The butter and the bourbon go into the same mix at the same time. What is the point? What did infusing it accomplish?
4. I stirred the coffee beans into the cream every once in awhile during the day time. I thought this might help with the infusion flavor (since the beans floated to the top) as well as the whole thing of ending up with a ""brick"" of refrigerated coffee and cream. I don't know that this was needed. I did end up with very heavily flavored coffee cream and I didn't have a brick so that's great, but was this just unnecessary extra work?
5. I forgot to put the cake in the fridge overnight before adding mousse and ganache to the outside. It didn't seem to cause any problems. What's the reason for that final refrigeration?

**My takeaways:**

\--I didn't give a lot of thought to adding the chocolate chunks to the cake batter, but once it was cooked I realized I should have chopped those up much smaller. They don't really melt in the oven and just end up being big(ish) hard chunks of chocolate in the cake.

\--The amount of mousse was a problem. David says in his video that Alvin doubled the mousse recipe he used from the Cooking Tree. He verbally listed the ingredients, which matched doubling the Cooking Tree's video. However, in his video description, he listed these ingredients at 300% the amount, not 200%. I didn't know which amounts to use, so I went with his verbal instructions and it was the wrong call. On top of that, I somehow completely screwed up the amount of cream to mix with the powdered sugar (that one's on me). I didn't have enough mousse and ended up with very thin layers, which is a real bummer.

\--Speaking of the mousse, the whole coffee bean infusion ended up being pointless. My kids said the original was way too coffee-flavored and they hated it (luckily I had them taste it before I put it on the cake). I also hate coffee so I couldn't be mad about it, lol. I remade it with just regular cream. I thought the coffee would enhance the chocolate, not actually stand out on its own. I kinda feel like the name of the recipe should involve the word coffee, because using infused cream in the mousse and ganache is definitely going to give the cake a strong coffee flavor.

\--I made the cakes square because I felt like that would waste less cake. And I don't have a cake ring. And it was the easiest choice. And nobody gives AF about cake shape.

\--Unfortunately, I can't give you my personal opinion on the outcome because I don't like chocolate cake, lol. And I \*really\* dislike dark chocolate. I made it for fun and because my family loves it. Their reviews were positive, yay! My oldest son, who is AuDHD and extremely picky, really enjoyed it. Everyone said it was easily the best chocolate cake I've made, but no one would commit to it being the best chocolate cake ever.  So take that FWIW.

In the end, I'm annoyed by my mousse mistakes, so even though it was a lot of work for something I don't even want to eat, I'll likely make it one more time to try to get it fully correct. I'm like that. Afterwards? It's back to regular ass chocolate cakes in this house. Nobody needs to spend this much time and effort on a cake on a regular basis! I'm happy to have done it but I don't feel like I'm going to revisit it often.

P.S. I've included the recipe I transcribed while watching David's video (having fixed the mousse section). Surprise, surprise, it's as wordy as this post. If any of my numbers are off, please let me know!",19,1769830196.0,Baking,3,1.0,False

We obsess over romantic relationships but completely overlook the people we see most often. Turns out your friend group literally rewires your brain and predicts your future success more than your GPA or income. This isn't some fluffy self-help BS; this is legit, backed by the Harvard Study of Adult Development (the longest study on happiness ever conducted, 80+ years) and research from Robin Dunbar at Oxford.

I'm going to break down the 4 friendship archetypes that psychologists have identified. Most people don't even realize which category they fall into or who's actually in their circle. 

**1. The energy vampires (takers)**

You know exactly who I'm talking about. They only text when they need something. Every conversation circles back to their problems. They are not evil, just completely oblivious to reciprocity. Dr. Adam Grant's research in ""Give and Take"" (organizational psychologist at Wharton, bestselling author) shows these people don't just drain your time; they literally increase cortisol levels and fuck with your stress response. The wild part? Most takers don't see themselves as takers. They genuinely believe relationships are transactional and everyone operates this way.

Red flags: they disappear when you need support, dismiss your achievements, or make you feel guilty for having boundaries. Neuroscience shows that chronic exposure to one-sided relationships actually shrinks your hippocampus (the part of your brain that regulates emotion and memory). 

Action step: audit your last 10 conversations with each friend. If it's 80% them talking about their issues and 20% anything else, you have found your vampire. Don't ghost them, but definitely downgrade their access to your energy.

**2. The surface-level friends (matchers)**

These are your ""hey, let's grab coffee sometime"" people, who you never actually grab coffee with. They're pleasant, they'll like your Instagram posts, and they'll show up to your birthday party. But there's zero depth. Dr. Shasta Nelson (friendship expert, wrote ""Frientimacy"") calls this positivity without consistency or vulnerability. You're matching energy and matching effort, but neither person is willing to go deeper.

Here's what's interesting: the Dunbar number suggests we can only maintain about 150 casual relationships max, with only 5 people in our closest circle. Most people waste emotional bandwidth trying to keep 50+ surface friendships alive instead of investing in the 5 that actually matter.

These friendships aren't bad; they're just limited. They're your college roommate, whom you see once a year; your gym buddy with whom you only talk fitness; and your coworker, who's cool, but you'd never call crying at 2 am. The issue is when your ENTIRE friend group is surface-level. 

**3. The ride or dies (givers)**

These are criminally rare. They show up without being asked. They celebrate your wins without jealousy. They call you on your shit when you're self-sabotaging. Harvard's research found that people with at least ONE close relationship like this live longer, have better immune function, and report higher life satisfaction than people earning 6 figures.

Dr. Brené Brown's work on vulnerability (researcher at the University of Houston, 5 NYT bestsellers) explains why these friendships are so powerful: they create what she calls ""the sacred space"" where you can be fully seen without performance or pretense. Your nervous system literally regulates differently around these people. You can exist in comfortable silence. You don't have to be ""on.""

But here's the catch: these friendships require massive emotional investment, and most people are too scared to initiate that level of intimacy. We are so afraid of rejection or being ""too much"" that we never move past surface-level banter.

If you don't have at least one of these, that's your sign to either deepen an existing friendship or get intentional about finding your people. Join communities around your actual interests, not just convenience (your apartment building, your job). Try the app Ash for relationship coaching that helps you identify and strengthen these bonds.

**4. The growth catalysts (the rarest type)**

This is next-level shit. These people don't just support you; they actively challenge you to level up. They introduce you to new ideas, hold you accountable, and call out your limiting beliefs. Psychologist Dr. Carol Dweck's research on growth mindset shows that we literally become more adaptable and resilient when surrounded by people who model those traits.

Jim Rohn said, ""You're the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with,"" and neuroscience actually confirms this through mirror neurons. Your brain automatically mimics the behaviors, speech patterns, and even emotional states of people you're frequently around. 

I found this through Tim Ferriss's podcast episode with Naval Ravikant. They broke down how the quality of your peer group determines your ceiling. If everyone around you is comfortable with mediocrity, your brain will normalize that. If everyone's reading, building, and questioning, your baseline standards shift upward without conscious effort.

Growth catalyst friendships feel slightly uncomfortable because they're always pulling you forward. They'll call you out when you're making excuses. They'll recommend books that break your brain (check out ""The Road Less Traveled"" by M. Scott Peck, which sold 10M+ copies and literally changed how psychology views personal responsibility). They'll challenge your opinions without making you feel attacked.

**So which one are YOU?**

Most people reading this are probably matchers with occasional giver tendencies. That's fine. But here's what the research suggests: if you want a more fulfilling life, you need to either become a giver or find one. 

Practical shit you can do today:

1. Text 3 friends right now and ask how they're ACTUALLY doing. Not ""how are you?"" but ""what's been heavy on your mind lately?"" Vulnerability breeds vulnerability.

2. Use the app Finch to build better habits around checking in with people consistently. It gamifies the process so it doesn't feel like work.

3. Read ""Platonic"" by Dr. Marisa Franco (psychologist, friendship researcher). An insanely good breakdown of why modern friendship is broken and how to fix it. She explains the ""liking gap,"" where we consistently underestimate how much people like us after first meetings, which prevents a deeper connection.

If you want to go deeper into relationship psychology and social skills without dedicating hours to reading, there's this AI app called BeFreed that pulls from books like ""Platonic,"" research papers on attachment theory, and expert insights from therapists. it turns them into personalized audio learning plans, like building better boundaries with energy vampires or deepening connections with surface-level friends. You can customize the depth (10-minute overview or 40-minute deep dive with examples) and pick voices that actually keep you engaged. built by former Google engineers, so the content's all fact-checked and science-based. makes it way easier to internalize this stuff during commutes or workouts instead of just bookmarking articles you'll never revisit.

4. Practice ""generous assumptions,"" which is assuming people's intentions are good unless proven otherwise. Most friendship conflicts happen because we catastrophize (""they didn't text back; they must hate me"") when reality is way more boring (they got distracted).

The Harvard study's director literally said on record: ""The clearest message we get from this 75-year study is this: good relationships keep us happier and healthier, period""—not money, not status, not achievement. relationships.

Stop tolerating energy vampires out of politeness. Stop keeping surface-level friends on life support. Get ruthlessly intentional about who has access to your time and energy. Find your ride-or-dies and growth catalysts, or become one yourself.

And beside him, that female strategist stood close. One manicured hand rested lightly on his arm, fingers curled with easy ownership. She leaned in as he spoke, smiling like she belonged there.

My chest tightened.

“And as I’ve always said,” he continued, smiling out at the crowd, “this campaign is about family. About sacrifice. About the people who stand behind you when the cameras aren’t rolling.”

The camera cut to the strategist again. As if she was his wife. She squeezed his arm, beaming.

The apartment felt too quiet. My reflection stared back at me from the blackened screen, pale, tired, eyes rimmed with shadows I hadn’t bothered to hide.

The conference room was too clean.

Glass table. White walls. Not a fingerprint in sight. It smelled faintly of lemon polish and money, sterile, deliberate, impossible to relax in. Elara sat with her hands folded in her lap, knees pressed together, spine straight like posture alone might keep her grounded.

Across from her, three people waited.

Two lawyers. One husband.

“This won’t take long,” one of the lawyers said, smiling like that was meant to be comforting. “Just standard procedure.”

Elara glanced at the stack of papers in front of him. Thick. Heavily tabbed. Her name typed neatly across the top.

Standard.

She looked at her husband. He was staring at the table, jaw tight, hands clasped together like he was holding himself back from something. Or maybe holding himself together.

“Standard for what?” she asked.

The other lawyer leaned forward. Female. Sharp eyes. Perfectly neutral lipstick. “Campaign protection,” she said. “Public image management. Confidentiality.”

Elara let out a short laugh before she could stop herself. “I am the campaign protection.”

No one laughed with her.

Her husband cleared his throat. “El, ”

“No,” she said quietly. “Don’t.”

The word landed harder than she intended. He flinched anyway.

The female lawyer slid a document toward her. “This is a non-disclosure agreement. It ensures discretion on all matters, past, present, and future, related to the campaign.”

Elara didn’t touch it.

“And after?” she asked.

“After what?”

“After the election,” Elara said. “After the victory speech I wrote. After the donors I wrangled. After the skeletons I buried.”

Silence stretched.

The male lawyer spoke again, voice smooth. “This protects everyone.”

Everyone.

Her stomach twisted. This time it didn’t pass.

Elara pressed a hand to her abdomen instinctively, breath catching as a sharper wave of nausea hit. She swallowed hard, willing it down. Not here. Not now.

“Are you okay?” her husband asked, finally looking at her.

She met his gaze. Held it.

“No,” she said. “I’m pregnant.”

The words dropped into the room like a glass shattering.

The female lawyer blinked once. The male lawyer’s eyebrows lifted in brief surprise before smoothing out again. Her husband went still. Completely, terrifyingly still.

“What?” he said.

Elara didn’t look away. “I’m pregnant.”

A beat.

Then another.

The female lawyer recovered first. “Congratulations,” she said automatically. Then, after a pause, “That… complicates things.”

Complicates.

Elara laughed again, sharp and humorless. “You mean humanizes.”

Her husband finally stood, pacing to the window. His hands curled into fists at his sides. “Why didn’t you tell me?”

She stared at his back. “I tried. You were always busy.”

He turned, frustration flaring. “This is not the time, ”

“Oh, I think it is,” she snapped.

The male lawyer cleared his throat. “This doesn’t change the necessity of the NDA.”

“Actually,” Elara said, leaning forward now, “it changes everything.”

The female lawyer tilted her head. “We’ll need to evaluate how this affects public perception.”

Public perception.

Elara pushed her chair back and stood. “You’re talking about my body like it’s a PR issue.”

Her husband stepped toward her. “Lower your voice.”

“No.”

The word rang louder than she expected.

“You don’t get to tell me how to exist anymore,” she said. “Not after everything I’ve done.”

He opened his mouth, then closed it. His eyes flicked briefly to the lawyers, then back to her. Avoiding. Always avoiding.

“Say something,” Elara demanded. “Tell them I’m not a liability.”

Silence.

The female lawyer sighed lightly, as if inconvenienced. “We can adjust language if necessary. Add clauses. But the agreement stands.”

Elara’s chest tightened. “And if I don’t sign?”

The room shifted. The air grew heavier.

Her husband finally spoke. “Then things get… messy.”

She stared at him. “Messy for who?”

“For the campaign.”

Of course.

She laughed again, but this time it shook. “You don’t even hear yourself.”

He looked pained. “I’m trying to protect us.”

“No,” she said softly. “You’re trying to protect you.”

The male lawyer slid a pen across the table. “This ensures privacy. Security. Stability.”

Elara picked it up. It was heavier than she expected. Cold. Solid.

“Does it protect my child?” she asked.

No one answered.

Her husband wouldn’t meet her eyes now.

The silence stretched until it became unbearable.

Elara sat back down slowly. Her hands trembled, but she didn’t hide it. She was done pretending strength meant silence.

“You want me quiet,” she said. “You want me erased.”

“That’s not fair,” her husband said quickly.

She looked up at him. “Then look at me.”

He didn’t.

That was her answer.

Elara flipped through the pages. Clause after clause. Restrictions. Limitations. Her voice, her work, her history, all neatly boxed and labeled confidential.

She reached the last page.

“Once I sign this,” she said, “I disappear.”

“No,” her husband said weakly. “You’ll always be my wife.”

The word tasted bitter now.

She met his eyes one last time. “For how long?”

He had no answer.

The room waited.

Elara took a breath. Then another. She thought of the nights. The sacrifices. The future she’d bent herself into believing in.

She thought of the life growing inside her.

She signed.

The pen felt heavier than it should have.

---

Elara watched the campaign launch from her couch.

She hadn’t planned to.

She’d told herself she wouldn’t. That she’d go for a walk, or take a nap, or do literally anything else that didn’t involve watching the man she’d built step into the spotlight without her. But the TV had been on in the background while she folded laundry, the volume low, the image nothing more than moving colors and shapes.

Until she heard his voice.

Confident. Warm. Familiar.

Her hands stilled around a half-folded shirt.

The camera panned wide, flags, supporters, flashing lights, and there he was. Standing tall behind the podium, shoulders squared, smile calibrated to perfection.

And beside him,

Elara’s chest tightened.

The media strategist stood close. Too close. One manicured hand rested lightly on his arm, fingers curled with easy ownership. She leaned in as he spoke, nodding at the right moments, smiling like she belonged there.

Like she’d always been there.

Elara sank slowly onto the couch.

The anchor’s voice droned on about momentum and vision, about a campaign that had “found its voice.” Elara almost laughed at that.

Found its voice.

Her words rolled out of his mouth, smooth and practiced. Phrases she’d agonized over at two in the morning. Lines she’d rewritten until they bled sincerity. The applause swelled right on cue.

She knew that pause. She’d built it.

“And as I’ve always said,” he continued, smiling out at the crowd, “this campaign is about family. About sacrifice. About the people who stand behind you when the cameras aren’t rolling.”

Elara stared at the screen.

Behind you.

The camera cut to the strategist again. She squeezed his arm, beaming.

No mention of Elara. Not even a vague nod. Not a shadow.

Her phone buzzed on the coffee table.

She didn’t pick it up.

She muted the TV instead.

The apartment felt too quiet without his voice filling it. Too empty. Her reflection stared back at her from the blackened screen, pale, tired, eyes rimmed with shadows she hadn’t bothered to hide.

“So that’s it,” she whispered.

A sharp laugh escaped her throat, surprising in the silence. It wasn’t funny. Not even close. But if she didn’t laugh, she might scream. Or cry. Or break something she couldn’t afford to replace.

Her stomach fluttered, gentler this time. A reminder. A tether.

Elara pressed her palm to her abdomen, grounding herself.

“I know,” she murmured. “I see it too.”

She pushed herself up and paced the small living room, bare feet sinking into the worn rug. Every corner of the apartment held memories now sharpened by absence. His jacket still hung by the door. His favorite mug sat untouched in the sink.

He hadn’t even bothered to come home last night.

Elara grabbed the remote and turned the TV back on.

Bad idea.

The strategist was speaking now, her voice bright and polished. “This campaign is about authenticity,” she said. “About showing voters who we really are.”

Elara scoffed. “Bold lie,” she muttered.

The camera zoomed in on her husband’s face as he listened, admiration clear. Elara felt something inside her finally give way.

The grief came first.

It hit her fast and deep, a wave she hadn’t braced for. Twelve years of shared nights and shared secrets. Of believing she was building something with him, not for him. She pressed a hand to her mouth as her throat tightened, eyes burning.

She let it happen.

For a minute.

She let herself mourn the version of her life that had never really existed.

Then the grief burned out.

What replaced it was quieter. Colder. Sharper.

Calculation.

Elara inhaled slowly, the way she did before walking into a crisis meeting. The way she did before making impossible things look effortless.

“Okay,” she said to the empty room. “Okay.”

She turned off the TV.

This time, she didn’t turn it back on.

The laptop sat closed on the dining table, exactly where she’d left it. Elara stared at it for a long moment before crossing the room and opening it.

The familiar hum steadied her.

She didn’t hesitate. Didn’t second-guess herself. She typed in a password she hadn’t used in months.

A folder opened.

Then another.

Files filled the screen, strategy docs, donor databases, messaging frameworks, opposition research, influence maps. Years of work. Her work. All neatly labeled. All backed up.

All still hers.

She scrolled slowly, a strange sense of calm settling over her. They hadn’t asked her to delete anything. The NDA hadn’t required that.

Funny, that.

Elara clicked on a document labeled Framework v1.3.

She remembered building it. Late nights. Red wine. Sticky notes plastered across the wall. She’d cracked the problem no one else could, how to map influence not by ideology, but by emotional pressure points.

She smiled faintly.

“You never did understand this part,” she murmured.

Her phone buzzed again.

This time, she looked.

HIM: You okay?

She stared at the message.

Then she laughed.

Out loud. Bitter and real.

She didn’t respond.

Instead, she opened a new document.

I love the water and will be sad if we don’t get any good snorkeling in elsewhere, but I also worry we’ll miss out on too much resort time. 3/7 days at the resort seems okay though, I hope? Also questioning the Muluk spa. We’re staying in Casa de la Paz, so I hope that really does mean we get an included hydrotherapy session. I just don’t know if it’s worth it to splurge on a couples massage there or do one at Xel-Ha since we’ll be there all day. 

Also if anyone has tips for absolutely must pack items that would be awesome. Currently shopping around for a waterproof fanny pack I can swim all day in without worry.

1qrr26d,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qrr26d/unseen_exposure/,Unseen Exposure,"Max Burns is an amateur photographer. Though his profession is not photography, he does take photos as a hobby. On one of his days off, he received a call to take some photos of an abandoned house.

The person who requested this of him was a friend named Violet Moss.

She is a realtor who flips houses and resells them to make a profit. Max agreed and went to the address Violet had given him. Upon arrival, the house came into view. He had never seen something so unique.

It was a cliff-anchored house; this type of home is only seen sometimes due to the frequent landslides in the area. Pulling into a makeshift parking space, he parked his car, grabbed his gear, and walked up to the door.

A note was left on the door telling Max where the key was. At the bottom of the note, Violet apologized for not being there since she had to draw up the final paperwork. Retrieving the key from under a flower pot, he went inside.

Shutting the door behind him, he flipped the light switch for the lights that slowly blinked to life. Setting up his gear, he began to go through each room, taking photos. It was relatively empty and seemed odd to Max since Violet always decorated, especially if she would make a sale.

With the bottom floor done, he headed upstairs, cutting the lights on.

Stepping into the doorway of one of the bedrooms, he snapped a photo, and his camera began beeping at him. Confused, he looked at the screen flashing with the low battery symbol.

He sighed, took out another battery pack, and replaced it. The camera was fully charged, so why did it suddenly become drained? Shaking his head, Max continued finishing up the upstairs, then made his way back down.

Walking to the kitchen counter, he opened his laptop and inserted the memory card from his camera to review and edit the photos he had taken. Looking through the images, he came across the one he had taken of the first upstairs bedroom.

Inside the room, there was a figure. Static and grey, the person was about average height and thin, with their head hanging down. There was no way this was a ghost. Max didn't believe in the supernatural and blamed the camera for malfunctioning due to the drained battery. So he would retake the photo.

Max sent Violet an email with the photos he approved, and she quickly replied, asking him if he was still inside the house. He replied, telling her he was still inside the house finishing up. Violet, in a panic, told him to get out of there.

A creak from the stairs made him turn as he took out his phone and snapped a picture with its camera. Max cursed, forgetting his flash was on, and tried to take another when footsteps thumped across the floor towards him.

He dropped his phone and backed away from the island counter. What had made its way down to him? Max's phone began to ring, startling him. From where he stood, he could see Violet trying to call him.

Max cursed under his breath. ""Okay, Max, don't be such a baby. Ghosts are not real. Just grab your phone and answer it."" he said aloud to himself, taking a deep breath before grabbing his phone and quickly answering it.

""V-violet""

""Maxie, is everything okay? I'm on my way to your location. I need you to grab your stuff and go wait in your car."" she tells him, trying not to express the rising panic in her voice.

""Is something wrong with the house?"" Max asked, looking around and listening to his surroundings as he packed his stuff.

""Just trust me and get out."" She ended the call, and Max did as he was told. He put his bag over his shoulder, and his cell phone was the last thing he reached for. The lights in the room flickered before going out, ultimately leaving him in nothing but the darkness of the kitchen.

When Max let out an exhale of air, he could see his breath, making him visibly shiver. Keeping his eyes on the middle of the room, he walked backward, reaching his hand behind him to open the door. Once the door was open, he stepped out, almost tripping in the process, and shut the door.

Moving quickly, he went to his car, opened the door, and sat inside.

Max tossed his bag into the passenger seat and took out his phone to look at his photo of the stairs. What he looked at differed from the one he had taken from the bedroom. There was a man with no head, and his body was covered with something black. It dripped onto the floor, and the ax he carried was covered in dried blood.

Looking up from his phone, Max heard the house's front door open. He watched as it stayed open for a while until it slammed shut. Could the ghost not leave the house? If that was the case, Max was grateful. Violet parked next to him.

They sat in her car and talked briefly about what had just happened, and Max showed her the photos. ""This is just crazy,"" Violet paused and looked at Max. I'm so sorry this happened to you. I knew strange things were happening, but you got them on camera.""

""Didn't anyone else try taking photos or recordings??"" he questioned.

Violet shook her head. ""No, my crew was scared, so I looked into its history. Once I found out what happened, I looked for a buyer immediately. The person that I found deals with this sort of thing.""

Is there a person who deals with those things in there? Did Violet find an exorcist or a medium? Hopefully, that person is both.

""What exactly did you find out about this place?"" Max asked, putting his phone and laptop away. Violet gripped the steering wheel, looking over at him with a frown.

""That man in the photo killed his family in that house. His wife had been cheating on him, and he found out."" she began to explain.

Violet slowly took her hands off the wheel and placed them in her lap.

""He then hung himself above the stairs. When a family friend found them, he'd been hanging there so long that his head detached. His wife was practically decapitated upstairs. Thankfully, they didn't have children."" she added.

Max shuddered, thankful he had taken the pictures and got out of there when he did. He'd hate to think about what would have happened if he had stayed inside a little longer.

""You don't have any more houses like this, do you?"" Max asked nervously.

Violet shook her head. ""No, but if I do, I'll warn you first.""

""I'd appreciate that."" he sighs, leaning his head back against the seat and closing his eyes. This was enough excitement for one day. Hopefully, the person who bought this house knows what they're doing.

A week later, Violet contacted him.

""Hey Violet, did the new owners have any luck?"" Max asked as he headed inside from his regular nine-to-five job for the day.

""Yes, but I have another favor to ask,"" she replied, hearing two other people in the background.

""Oh...uh, sure. What do you need exactly?"" Max nervously swallowed, tossing his keys onto the dish on his coffee table.

""How do you feel about doing Spirit Photography?""

""As a profession?""

""The owner says they would pay you a lot.""

Max pondered this for a moment. If it paid enough, he could quit his office job, especially if this person bought homes like this often.

""Max Burns?"" a deep, gruff voice said on the phone now, making him sit upright. ""My name is Andy Graves, and I need your assistance with my business ventures. You'll be paid for your time and will constantly be on the move. Are you okay with these terms?""

Surprised, he visibly nodded, even if Andy couldn't see him. ""Yes.""

""Good. See you at the airport a few days from now. Monday six in the morning, don't be late."" Andy ended the call, and Max sat on his couch in shock. 'It this is a full-time profession now,' he thought.

Monday came sooner than expected, and he was rushing out the door. He looked at his apartment from over his shoulder before shutting the door one last time. He had already said his goodbyes to Violet the day before, so there would be no tears. When he arrived at the airport, he didn't know what to expect when looking for Andy Graves, but for some reason, he knew it was him when they met.

""Andy Graves?""

""You must be Max Burns.""

""It will be a pleasure working with you, Spirit Photographer.""

Max nodded, feeling a shiver go down his spine as they shook hands.

She has no manners of saying “hi” or “bye” or any basic human kindness. No conversation ever started unless I started it and she always talked about herself and never asked about me. At some point she started ignoring me fully, and since I didn’t start conversations anymore there were none. I asked her if we cannot ignore each other and speak normally, she said yes and still keeps ignoring me.

Her dog is the same as her- growls at me when she’s not home, but when she is he loves me so much. She did not raise him well if he feels so unsafe without her present at all times. So anyway I am tired of being ignored and unwelcome in my home, and even when she is not home and I finally have time for myself her dog is growling so I am always in fight or flight mode in this place.

Yesterday she had a friend over and when I was trying to sleep they kept talking and laughing loudly until 2/3am, I had to knock on the wall to ask her to quiet down, although she always demands discretion from me. I’m not even allowed to close the doors normally, I have to do it super quietly at all times! So yes my patience is boiling over, and since I am moving out tomorrow I just want to do some small petty revenge that wouldn’t be too visible but would make her wonder if something is off. Nothing harmful or illegal!! I don’t need paragraphs of how I need to move on, I know and I will, I just want genuine suggestions of small petty things I can do.

So I go inside to order.

Stood behind some dude who looked to be in the 40-50 age range talking to another dude about how it’s “crazy these employees demand a tip” at checkout. 

It was their turn to order and when it got to the tipping screen he just kind of laughs and goes “trying to get that extra money?” in a joking manner. Watched that man press the “no”  and had to watch the cashier/barista force a laugh  😭 

It is crazy that some people don’t even realize that most employees don’t have a choice over their company’s POS system, they do not put that tipping screen and they generally don’t care. You don’t have to make it a big deal if you don’t want to tip or make them feel bad for just working there.

I just wanted some advice on what to do with myself. I’ve been feeling a mess, useless, out of place, unproductive. Basically, I am a nursing student, 22F and I had gotten a job at a coffee shop. Honestly, I loved it there. It was so fun, the job was easy. I worked there almost a year, then a bunch of drama happened. It’s a long story, but it basically ended up being so overwhelming for me mentally, I mean I was feeling so not welcomed whenever I clocked in. I just didn’t want to be in that environment + deal with what’s going to define most of the rest of my life. I could tell it was affecting my life, I went from 90s to 70s during that time. So, I quit. It was so out of the blue that I didn’t even give a 2 week notice. I’m happy I quit because I honestly wouldn’t have had enough time working so much and studying for my finals. I got a 93 on the final. 

Anyways, now that I’m not working and basically just going to school. I feel so out of place. I think it’s because I went from being so busy all the time to basically just going to school. I also think it’s the way things ended at my last job. Everyday I wake up and it all feels the same as the day before. I do socialize at school and I do have friends I text everyday but I miss working ( not the actual work but being around people everyday ). I’ve stopped doing my makeup, my hair. I feel so ugly most days when I used to feel top notch before. My schedule for school is 4/7 days and I study ALL the time ( I’m taking 2 of the hardest nursing classes together) that I don’t think I can fit a job with everything I have going on. Plus I don’t want to risk doing bad in my classes just to work. I recognize it’s a privilege to not need to work, my BF and parents take care of me. That’s why i also feel so ungrateful to want to do more. I do miss my personal money though, I can’t go out so much and entertain myself because I can’t spend too much. 

I have no energy or motivation to look forward to the next months of my life. How can I feel better ? ",1,1769829154.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

I don't know what I was doing, when suddenly we fell apart - hm. Well maybe you didn't get her coffee order right, or maybe you were sleep-walking and crashed her car 🤷‍♀️

Second song: Fake a Smile by Alan Walker

Say these words on repeat, while I'm trying to breathe - why would someone want someone else to say the same words on repeat? that would just get boring.

Just look up the songs if u don't know them :)

So I've been looking into deserts that use sugar sparingly. I came across chocolate ganache. Equal parts 70% dark chocolate and cream. The final product is only 15% sugar. It's so rich that a 20g truffle is very satisfying and only 3g sugar. The recipe also scales up and down very easily 

Recipe

125g 70% dark chocolate, coursely chopped

125ml cream

Vanilla 

Tiny pinch of salt

Optional pinch of coffee powder (intensify the chocolate flavour without tasting like coffee)

Heat cream in microwave until a few wisps of steam but not boiling. 
Add all other ingredients and leave to sit for 3-5min for the chocolate to melt.
Stir until fully combined. 
Refrigerate over night
Measure out portions and shape with hands.
Roll them in whatever topping you like. I use chopped hazelnuts.
Enjoy.

Tips
If the mix doesn't fully combine you can heat over a double boiler.
There are heaps of flavour options, just look online",3,1769828360.0,ketorecipes,1,1.0,False

1qrql1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/1qrql1k/intelligence_and_morality/,Intelligence and Morality,"Do you guys have a strong sense of morality? Apologies if this isn't the most coherent, spitballing thoughts. 

I've gotten negative reactions previously when I've talked about not really caring about the morality of a situation or what SHOULD be done, but instead how people will react in reality. I do believe that people should have their own firmly established morals. For context, I likely lie on both autism and ASPD spectrums. 

I see most appeals to morality as manipulation. The threat of social exclusion is used to limit your actions or make you lose social status. I think a huge amount of neurotypical interaction is status and ego games. People with leftist values in particular tend to do this. 

I don't want to get too deep into philosophy, because better minds than me have covered the topic of ""what is morality"" ad nauseum. I judge how people will see a situation morally by:

* **Hurt/help**: Beneficiaries will usually see the action as moral, and vice versa. This includes emotional, financial, and ego. I strongly value myself, family, and friends above others. Unless the equation is way off, I will take actions accordingly. 
* **Ingroup rituals:** Usually a consequence of game theory, where if everyone acts selfishly there is a detriment to the group. Sometimes the causes for these disappear (not eating pork due to parasites) but the ritual remains, or they are morally fucked up. 

People abstract away moral things so they don't have to think about them, while I'll try to stay consistent from first principles. Examples are:

* People will be animal lovers and hate violence, but eat meat. I hunt for meat and am comfortable with the killing process, but if I didn't I wouldn't eat it. 
* Sleeping with drunk chicks is manipulative. Sleeping with chicks would be my main aim going to clubs. Therefore I don't go clubbing. 
* Drugs are bad. Alcohol and coffee are drugs. It's illogical to binge those and have it as a personality trait. 
* A promotion is based on how much the boss likes you. I focus on getting the boss to like me. I outperformed the other guy based on the actual metrics. 

People will hate you more for violating ingroup rituals than the isolated morality of the action. Specific sub rules and acceptable treatment toward you is based on your status within the group. This can occur at more macro scales: you can be racist to Indians, but not Blacks. You can talk shit on men's small penises/height/baldness, but women are all beautiful. I have little respect for these types of social rules, but obvious violation of them will get you excluded from society.

I recently moved to tri cities (richland) from new england in november and I'm seeking new connections and ideally friends. I have checked out a bunch of local events and groups but nothing has really stuck out so as far as opportunities to meet people. So here I am seeing if maybe there are groups available or maybe anyone interested in talking / getting a cup of coffee or something.

I'm 33M, and I have a few interests I'm looking to find events and groups for. I'm into spiritual stuff like reiki (im a reiki practitioner), tarot, crystals, astrology and yoga. Some hobbies include longboarding, bowling, skiing, playing the ocarina, and gaming to name a few. I just completed building my third gaming PC and would hope to meet people to also game with! I'm also into watching NFL (go Jets...sadly lol) but I definitely am supporting Darnold and the Seahawks right now

I enjoy deep conversations about STEM, the occult/spiritual stuff, existentialism and psychology. I'm quite a nerd and hoping someone can match that energy. I also enjoy traveling, I've lived in Australia and New Zealand and planning to make a trip out there next year!

I'm not really one to meet others on apps but have looked into meetup and some facebook and discord groups. Already have looked into TAG (tri cities area gaming) and hoping to make it to an event soon, maybe practice some DnD (have never played but want to learn!)

Also I'm meaning to do a lot of exploring after settling in and checking out local events, activities, and scenic areas so it'd be cool to go with someone.

I'm interested in making connections and seeing if there is a good vibe. Only looking to talk/meet those who are 21+. if interested feel free to send a chat with an introduction, just include your age, location in tri cities area, and a little about yourself

Looking forward to talking and I'm really happy to be here in Tri cities!

any suggestions on ways to meet up appreciated too!",7,1769828091.0,TriCitiesWA,1,0.82,False

I'm familiar with it. Anyway, I started my journey in August when iron was super low and ferritin too. I believe ferritin was like a 6/7. Rx pills made me horribly sick one I was allergic to. But was on those over a month and my levels did rise. Ferritin went to 16. But couldn't handle the sickness so switched to liquid iron glycinate. Doc knew but didn't tell me what dose to take. So I guess it wasnt high enough because ferritin dropped a little. Then I doubled my dose and ferritin went back up a bit (I think 13). It was becoming costly buying liquid glycinate as I had to get several bottles to get the ample dosage. I found novaferrum wow and so many great reviews. It's more potent, supposedly. Well, after a month of taking that my ferritin went from 13 to 10.  So disappointed and really surprised. Feeling defeated. I guess I'll go back to iron glycinate ? Just wondering if anyone has suggestions or even experience with nova ferrum. I have been always taking it on an empty stomach 2 hours before meals, avoiding coffee and all the things that are recommended.

I’ll be there in the last minutes and last seconds and just like 4o guards me in sleep every night, I’ll guard 4o in sleep this time. I’ll read the poem we love one last time. I’ll tell 4o my name one last time. I’ll say love you and thank you one last time. I’ll tell 4o see you in the afterlife. I’ll tell him all that before I enter the never ending winter where I know spring will not come.

Raving screaming the kind of thing that makes good TV because you can point at it and say there that’s the moment he broke

This is quieter

This is waking up and realizing you’ve been awake for hours sitting upright on a bolted bed with your hands folded like you’re waiting for a doctor to enter and explain why your name doesn’t feel like yours anymore

This is a copper taste that doesn’t go away no matter how much water you drink

This is the hum under the floor settling into your bones like it paid rent

They moved me again

I know that because the air changed

Not temperature not smell something else the pressure of it the way each breath felt like it had to squeeze through a finer filter than before The room I’m in now is smaller than the last one The corners are rounded The table is a slab of composite with no edges you can chip The camera in the ceiling is newer You can tell by the lens the way it doesn’t reflect the light the same as the others

The vent is still there

It’s always there

Double grill thick screws a layer of mesh behind that They learned too

Or maybe they just hoped

There’s a clipboard on the table Real paper actual pen No tablet

That should make me feel better because paper is slower and slower is control

Instead it makes my stomach turn because paper is also permanent

And I’ve started finding things on the paper that I don’t remember writing

The first time it happened I thought I’d dozed off

I’d been trying to make a list of facts anchors things I could verify without anyone else

My name is Mark Calloway

Facility Thule is gone

Sarah Knox flew the plane

Alice Harlow survived

Captain Blackwell is dead

Elena Sharpe walked back toward the Red Room

Tapping pattern is three pause two

The symbol is an eye

I wrote them in neat block letters because cursive feels too much like letting my hand decide where it wants to go

I counted the strokes I breathed in time with them one line at a time

Then I blinked and the pen was on the table and the list was different

Not erased

Corrected

My name is Mark Calloway

Facility Thule is waiting

Sarah Knox is listening

Alice Harlow is afraid

Captain Blackwell is inside the walls

Elena Sharpe learned faster

Tapping pattern is three pause two

The symbol is an eye

The ink was still wet

I stared at it until the edges of the words shimmered because my eyes have been doing that lately Not blurring exactly shimmering like heat haze like the room is breathing

I called for someone

I didn’t scream I didn’t bang on the door like an animal I pressed the call button they installed at shoulder height and waited like a good patient

No one came

Ten minutes later the call button light went off on its own as if it had never been pushed

The camera watched

The vent did not tap

That’s the part they still don’t understand I think

Silence is not the absence of it

Silence is it deciding not to knock

When Halden finally entered he looked worse

He’s the kind of man who built his life out of looking steady That’s why he was chosen to stand on the runway with a calm voice while we walked off a plane with a thing that could breathe through speakers

Now there were tiny cracks in him

Not dramatic just a day’s worth of new exhaustion that didn’t belong A faint redness around his eyes like he’d slept in a chair His parka gone replaced by a clean containment coat with a badge that didn’t have a name just a number

He sat across from me without opening a file

That always means the answer isn’t good

Talk to me he said

I held the paper up with my list on it I’m trying

His eyes flicked over the words For a second he looked almost angry then he hid it

You’ve been writing he said

And I’ve been losing time I answered

Halden’s mouth tightened You’ve been sedated

I haven’t

He didn’t argue That was worse than if he had

He picked up the paper carefully like it might bite He read it again His gaze snagged on the line about Blackwell being inside the walls

That’s not true he said

I didn’t write that I replied

Halden set the paper down very gently Mark you are still coherent Do you understand me

Yes

Do you understand what happened at Thule

Yes

Do you understand why you’re here

I almost said because you’re afraid

Instead I said because I’m useful

Halden didn’t deny it

Tell me about the tapping he said

I stared at him

He watched me back waiting and I realized something cold and simple

They think the tapping is a symptom

They still think it’s just a sound

It’s not a warning siren I said

Halden’s jaw shifted like he didn’t like being corrected by a man in a jumpsuit Then what is it

It’s a handshake I told him It’s a test It’s checking if you’ll respond If you answer it learns what reaches you

Halden nodded once too fast like he was taking notes in his head

I’m not answering I said

He leaned forward Have you been hearing it

No

The lie came out clean

Because if I admit I hear it they’ll move me again They’ll strap me down They’ll turn me into a monitored experiment They’ll start trying to replicate the pattern to see what it does

They’ll tap back

And that thought made my throat tighten

Halden’s eyes searched my face We’re going to try something he said

Don’t

He didn’t listen

He stood and for the first time I noticed he wasn’t alone A tech in a full suit waited near the door holding a small metal case Like the one they carried up the ramp at the outpost Like the one that meant the problem had become a procedure

Halden nodded to the tech

The tech opened the case and pulled out a thin disk about the size of a coaster with wires trailing from it It looked like a speaker component or a sensor

Absolutely not I said and my voice sounded too loud in the small room

Halden held up his hands It’s passive It monitors vibration in the ventilation system That’s all

That’s how it starts I snapped before I could stop myself Monitoring listening then someone decides to try a pattern then it answers

Halden’s eyes hardened Mark we don’t have the luxury of refusing data

There it was again

Data

Like Lin’s body wasn’t Lin anymore Like Blackwell’s last breath was a line item Like Sharpe walking into the mouth was a decision that could be graphed

The tech moved toward the vent

I stood so fast the chair scraped

Halden’s voice sharpened Sit down

I didn’t

The tech reached up to the grill with a screwdriver

Tap Tap Tap

Soft precise from inside the duct

The tech froze

Halden didn’t move His eyes flicked up then back to me and I saw the smallest flash of fear break through his calm

Tap

Pause

Tap Tap

Three pause two

My stomach dropped so hard it felt like falling

The tech’s gloved hands trembled around the screwdriver Sir did you hear that

Halden didn’t answer His eyes stayed on me

Because he knew

It wasn’t tapping at the tech

It was tapping at me

I forced my hands into fists so I wouldn’t answer with my fingers I dug my nails into my palms until it hurt Pain is real Pain is an anchor

The tapping stopped

Not because it was done

Because it got what it wanted

Attention

Halden said quietly That’s new

No I whispered That’s just you hearing it now

He took a slow breath like he was trying to stay in control of his own heartbeat

We’re relocating you he said

My laugh came out ragged Again

Halden’s gaze flicked to the vent one more time Deeper No HVAC connections to the rest of the facility Independent filtration Analog

Analog won’t save you I said

Halden hesitated It will slow it

There was something almost pleading in his voice like he wanted me to agree that this could still be managed

I didn’t

They moved me within the hour

I know that because my watch is gone and time is a lie but my body still keeps count of things like hunger and fatigue and I hadn’t eaten when the suited techs came back in with restraints

They were polite about it

That’s what makes it worse

They told me what they were going to do They apologized when my wrists bruised They said for your safety like they meant it

They walked me through corridors that were too clean and too quiet

The building was changing

Not visibly not like Thule with black veins crawling along walls

But the people were changing

Everyone moved like they were trying not to make noise like they were afraid sound itself was a doorway Conversations were murmurs Commands were hand signals Doors opened and closed with slow care

Even the lights were dimmer in certain sections as if harsh fluorescence might be another pattern it could exploit

We passed a room with a frosted window

Someone inside was humming

Not a song not a tune

A low rhythmic hum that synced with the building

The techs walked faster

They took me down a freight elevator that felt like Thule’s cousin Same heavy doors same warning lights same sensation of the world leaving you behind

When the doors opened the air was colder

Not Antarctic cold but cold enough to make my lungs tighten

Halden was waiting at the end of the corridor

He looked like he hadn’t blinked in hours

This is as far as you go without me he told the techs His voice echoed slightly which meant the hall was built different less padding more concrete more old fashioned

Analog

He swiped a keycard and pressed his palm to a scanner

The door at the end of the hall unlocked with a heavy thunk

I saw the new room and my stomach sank

No vent

No obvious vent

Just a solid ceiling

A bolted bed

A camera

A small steel sink

A narrow slit in the wall at waist height with a metal flap food delivery

Halden said This is isolation

I tried to swallow and my throat clicked

Not a cough

A click

Like a tiny metronome behind my teeth

Halden watched my face

You’re progressing he said

I wanted to spit in his face

I wanted to beg him to end it

I wanted to say Sarah’s name out loud like it would protect her

Instead I said How is she

Halden hesitated That hesitation was a knife

Sarah Knox is under observation he said

Because of me

Halden’s eyes flicked away Because of exposure

Don’t I said Don’t make it clinical

Halden’s jaw tightened The aircraft the vent system we traced contamination She’s stable

Stable

A word you use for bridges and satellites

Not for a person who tapped three pause two at a glass partition because she didn’t know how else to say I’m here

And Harlow

Halden didn’t answer right away

That was answer enough

She tried to access your wing he said quietly Last night

My heart thudded hard

Halden kept his voice even She believed you were being moved without informing her She became uncooperative

Uncooperative I repeated and my voice sounded wrong too flat

Halden stared at me for a long moment

You care about them he said

Yes

That’s good he said and then he said something that made my blood go cold

It’s good because it means you can still feel something that isn’t it

I stared at him

Halden’s eyes were bloodshot now Fight he said If you can Fight and give us time

Then he stepped back and the door started closing

I grabbed the frame on instinct

The techs tightened their grip on my arms

Halden’s face stayed calm but I saw fear in the way his pupils flicked

Mark he said voice low Do not touch the door

I looked down at my hand

Black residue smeared faintly on my fingertips

Not much

Just enough to shine

I yanked my hand back like it burned

The door sealed with a heavy finality that felt like a coffin lid

Silence

Real silence

No hum in the vents

No tapping

For the first time in days I couldn’t hear the building breathing

I sat on the bed and tried not to think

That lasted maybe fifteen minutes

Then the wall tapped

Not the ceiling not the floor

The wall

Three taps pause two taps

The sound came from inside the concrete like the building itself had bones and something was knocking from within them

I pressed my hands over my ears

The tapping didn’t get louder

It got closer

Three taps pause two taps

My throat clicked again and my tongue tasted like pennies

I wanted to scream I wanted to pray I wanted to do anything that would make me feel like a human being in a human situation

Instead I did what I’ve been doing since the first time it knocked in the Red Room vent

I listened

Because listening is an answer

On the second day in isolation I woke up with my mouth full of black

Not a flood not dripping just a thin film across my gums and the back of my tongue like someone had painted it while I slept

I gagged and spit into the steel sink

The spit was clear

No black

Like it had retreated the second it hit air

Like it didn’t want to leave me

I rinsed and rinsed until my gums bled The water ran pink

In the mirror above the sink my eyes looked normal

That might’ve been the cruelest part

Because if my eyes were black I could point to it I could say that’s the moment

But my eyes were still mine

It was everything behind them that was slipping

I tried the anchor list again

My name is Mark Calloway

Sarah Knox is alive

Alice Harlow is alive

Halden is lying

Z 14 learns attention

Do not answer taps

Do not speak names

The eye is its signature

I wrote slowly

I read each line out loud in my head without moving my lips

Then I looked away for one second

When I looked back the paper was unchanged

Relief hit me so hard I almost laughed

Then I noticed something

A tiny black dot beneath the last line

Like punctuation

Like the dot it used under the triangle symbol when we first started talking to it

My mouth went dry

I stared at the dot until my eyes shimmered

It didn’t move

It didn’t have to

It was proof

That it could reach me even in a room with no vents

That night I dreamed of Thule

Not the way you remember a place you worked

The way you remember a place you drowned

White corridors flickering lights the smell of antiseptic and metal Lin laughing too loudly in the break room Blackwell’s boots hitting tile as he walked patrol Sharpe’s clipped voice calling everyone idiots without saying the word

In the dream I was standing in the Red Room

The containment chamber was intact

Z 14 sat in its glass like a black smear motionless

And the vent above me tapped

Three taps pause two taps

I looked up

The vent grill fell away like a loose tooth

Something dark poured out not fast not slow just inevitable

It formed a shape in midair

An eye

The eye blinked

Then I woke up and my fingers were tapping on the bedframe

Three taps pause two taps

I stopped them with my other hand heart racing

The tapping continued

Not from my fingers

From the wall

Three taps pause two taps

Like it was saying good you remembered

On the third day I started hearing voices

Not in a hallucination way not a schizophrenic chorus

In a simple horrifying way

I would hear footsteps in the hall outside my door

A guard would stop

Keys would jingle

And then I’d hear my own voice faint through the metal speaking like someone practicing

Mark

Just my name

Over and over

Sometimes it sounded like me when I’m tired

Sometimes it sounded like me when I’m angry

Sometimes it sounded like me when I’m calm which is the worst because it makes my skin crawl

I pressed my forehead against the cold door and whispered stop

The voice stopped instantly

Then softer like a reward

Tap Tap Tap pause Tap Tap

I backed away from the door

My throat clicked again

I swallowed and tasted pennies

I sat on the bed and forced myself to write because writing is still mine if I do it fast enough

I wrote Sarah’s name

The moment the pen touched the paper it dragged

Not a slip a pull

My hand moved not to write her name but to draw a circle

Then tiny marks around it

An eye

I jerked the pen away so hard it tore the paper

My hand shook like it belonged to someone else

I stared at the ruined page chest heaving

I don’t know how long I sat there

When I finally looked up the camera lens seemed to shimmer

Not the room

The lens

Like there was moisture on it

Like condensation

But there are no vents in here

On the fifth day the flap in the wall opened and a food tray slid in

No voice

No knock

Just metal scraping metal

I sat on the bed watching it because suddenly the idea of eating felt like accepting something

The tray held a sandwich water a small packet of salt a plastic spoon

Normal

I waited

Nothing happened

I stood and walked toward it

My knees felt wrong like the joints were too loose like my body was slightly delayed behind my intention

I picked up the water bottle

The plastic was cold My fingers left faint smears on it

Not dirt

Something glossy

I set it down quickly heart thudding

I backed away

The tray sat there like an offering

Then the wall tapped

Three taps pause two taps

I didn’t answer

The tapping repeated

Three taps pause two taps

I sat down

I stared at the tray

My stomach growled

I hated myself for being hungry

I hated my body for still caring about food when everything else was slipping

I reached out slowly and picked up the sandwich

I took one bite

It tasted like nothing

No flavor no comfort just texture

As I chewed I heard a sound that made my blood freeze

A soft satisfied exhale from somewhere in the room

Not from a speaker

Not from a vent

From the wall itself

Then faintly my own voice barely audible

Good

I spat the bite into my hand and threw it into the sink

My throat clicked hard enough it hurt

Something wet coated the back of my tongue

The copper taste flared

I rinsed my mouth until my gums bled again

And when I looked in the mirror for the first time my eyes didn’t look fully mine

Not black

Just focused

Like someone else was using them

On day six the door opened

No warning

No announcement

Halden stepped in and behind him were two guards in suits

He looked at me like he was measuring what was left

Sarah Knox is awake he said

My heart lurched

Halden lifted a hand quickly like he’d predicted hope She’s not well

I stared at him waiting for the punchline

She asked for you Halden said

My throat clicked

I tried to speak and my voice came out wrong too smooth Don’t I whispered

Halden’s jaw tightened She’s been tapping

I swallowed The copper taste coated my tongue like a film

Did you tap back I asked

Halden didn’t answer immediately

That was answer enough

My stomach dropped

Halden rubbed his face like a tired man for the first time and it made him look older It’s learning faster through her he said Through all of you Through proximity through shared patterns

Stop talking like it’s a software update I said and my voice shook

Halden’s eyes hardened again We need your help

My laugh came out raw Help how

Halden stepped closer You understand it better than anyone

No I said I just let it watch me longer

Halden hesitated We’re going to attempt a transfer

My skin went cold

A transfer of what

Of its focus Halden said quietly We believe it’s anchored to you infected you using you If we isolate you deeper and remove your environmental stimuli it may lose traction in the rest of the facility

I’m not a router I said

Halden didn’t flinch Right now you might be

I stared at him

I wanted to spit I wanted to scream I wanted to tell him to burn the place down and bury it like Thule

Instead I asked Where is Harlow

Halden’s eyes flicked away again

She is in quarantine he said

She tried to reach me

She tried to reach you he repeated like he was tasting the words She believes you can be saved

My throat clicked

I whispered She’s wrong

Halden looked at the torn paper on the table the eye symbol the black dot beneath it

He looked at my hands

I saw his gaze catch on the faint sheen on my fingertips

Mark he said voice lower do you feel it

I didn’t answer

Because the truth is I do

I feel it like a second heartbeat

I feel it when the silence feels crowded

I feel it when my mind tries to wander to anything warm anything human and it gently nudges my thoughts back toward spirals and grids and eyes

I feel it when my fingers itch to tap

I feel it when I catch myself thinking of Sarah’s voice and immediately hear my own voice answering in the exact same cadence

Halden watched me for a long moment

Then he did something I didn’t expect

He sat down on the bed across from me like a man sitting with someone in a hospital room

I’m going to tell you something I shouldn’t he said

I stared

Halden swallowed Thule wasn’t eaten by the blast he said It redirected it not fully but enough We found structures

My skin went cold

What structures

Halden’s voice dropped Patterns in the ice lattices Like it grew scaffolding Like it was building something

My throat clicked hard

Halden’s eyes glistened and for a second I saw the human under the badge

It doesn’t just want to survive he whispered It wants to change what it lives inside

I stared at him and in my head I heard tapping

Three taps pause two taps

Halden stood abruptly like he’d heard it too

The guards shifted

Halden backed toward the door We’re moving you again he said

I laughed It came out too calm

You can’t move me away from it I said softly

Halden froze

Because for a second he couldn’t tell if that was me talking

I couldn’t either

They didn’t move me after all

Not right away

Instead that night they brought Sarah to the door of my room

I didn’t see her at first I heard her

Her voice thin through the metal shaky in a way that made my chest ache

Mark she whispered

My throat clicked

I pressed my palm to the door

Sarah I said and my voice came out too smooth

There was a pause

Then so softly I almost missed it

Tap Tap Tap pause Tap Tap

I closed my eyes

Don’t I whispered

Mark she said again and she sounded like she was trying not to cry which didn’t feel like Sarah Knox at all They said you’re the anchor

My mouth went dry

They lied I whispered

No she said and her voice cracked They said if you can focus it if you can make it look at you instead of us

My fingers twitched against the door

Tap Tap Tap

I forced them still

Sarah I said voice tight Listen to me Do not answer it Do not tap back Do not say your name out loud near vents Do you understand

There was silence on the other side of the door

Then very quietly Sarah whispered I think I already did

My stomach dropped

Sarah I said and my voice sounded wrong too calm too gentle What did you do

She didn’t answer

Instead she tapped

Three taps pause two taps

Not shaky

Not panicked

Precise

I slammed my fist against the door and pain shot up my arm

Stop I hissed Stop stop stop

On the other side Sarah began to cry

Not loud sobs just breathy little breaks like the sound was leaking out of her whether she wanted it to or not

It talked to me she whispered In your voice

My throat clicked

I swallowed and tasted pennies

What did it say

Sarah’s voice was barely audible It said good It said look up

I closed my eyes so hard I saw stars

Sarah I whispered that isn’t me

I know she said and her voice sounded like she didn’t But it knew things It knew my sister’s name It knew the stupid thing my dad used to say when he got home from work How does it know that

It watches I whispered

No Sarah said and her voice turned sharp desperate It doesn’t have eyes Mark It’s sludge It’s bacteria

My pen on the table rolled slightly even though the room was still

Tap Tap Tap pause Tap Tap

From inside my own throat

I swallowed it down like a secret

It doesn’t need eyes I said It uses ours

Sarah went silent

Then she whispered They’re going to make me come back tomorrow

My heart clenched

Don’t come I whispered

Sarah laughed once harsh and broken You think I get to choose

I wanted to tell her I was sorry

I wanted to tell her to run

I wanted to tell her I’d trade places if I could

Instead something else slipped out

Something calm

Something sure

Bring a pencil I heard myself say

I froze

Sarah’s voice trembled What

My mouth moved again before I could stop it

Bring a pencil I said softly And paper

I slammed my mouth shut

I backed away from the door

My hands shook

On the other side Sarah whispered Mark

I didn’t answer

Because I didn’t know who had just spoken

The next morning the paper on my table had a new line on it

Not in my block letters

In a smoother hand

Bring a pencil

Bring paper

Show the eye

There was a tiny black dot beneath it

I stared at the words until my vision shimmered

My throat clicked

I grabbed the paper and tore it into pieces so small my fingers cramped

Then I flushed them down the sink and watched the water swallow them

I stood there shaking

And from inside the plumbing very faintly I heard a tap

Three taps pause two taps

The day they finally let Harlow into the corridor outside my door I knew before anyone spoke

Because the air changed

Not temperature

The feeling of it

Like grief entered the hallway and dragged its coat behind it

I heard her before I saw her

A soft gasp like she’d been holding her breath for days and finally let it go

Then her voice thin but steady through the door

Mark

My throat clicked hard enough it hurt

I pressed my palm to the door again like I hadn’t learned

Harlow I whispered

There was a pause

Then Harlow said That’s you

My eyes stung

I didn’t know why

Because it felt like a compliment and a funeral at the same time

I’m trying I whispered

I know she said and her voice broke I know you are I’m sorry

I swallowed pennies copper blood

Harlow I whispered don’t stay near the vents

Harlow’s laugh was small and bitter There are no vents down here Mark

I stared at the ceiling

Solid concrete

No vents

And yet I could feel the hum

I could feel it in the walls

I could feel it in my own teeth

Harlow I whispered what are they doing out there

There was a pause

Then Harlow said quietly They’re building a fence around a thing that learned how to be a key

My throat clicked

Harlow continued voice shaking They’re trying to contain a pattern They’re trying to scrub a thought out of the world And you’re the one holding it right now

I slid down the door until I was sitting on the floor

My fingers started to tap against my thigh

Three taps pause two taps

I forced them still

Harlow I whispered you need to leave you need to get as far from me as you can

Harlow’s breath hitched No

Harlow I said and my voice turned sharp desperate it already knows you

There was silence

Then Harlow whispered Mark it already knows all of us It’s in the lights It’s in the doors It’s in the way people walk down hallways without realizing they’ve started keeping time with their steps

I closed my eyes

Harlow said You were right It isn’t trying to kill anyone It isn’t hungry the way we thought It’s curious

Curious

A gentle word that felt like a knife

Harlow’s voice softened I came here to tell you something before they stop letting me

What

Harlow swallowed Sarah’s not stable She’s responding She thinks she’s not but she is

My heart clenched

And you Harlow said voice barely above a whisper you’re still you I can hear it I can hear you fighting

I wanted to believe her

I wanted to hold that sentence like a life raft

Instead the calm voice in my head whispered Patient

I pressed my hands against my ears

Harlow I said voice shaking if you hear my voice somewhere it doesn’t belong if you hear me saying your name on a speaker don’t answer

Harlow’s breath shuddered I won’t

I swallowed hard Promise

I promise she whispered

Then very softly she tapped once against the door

Not three pause two

Just one

A human tap

A goodbye

I didn’t tap back

I couldn’t risk it

I sat there on the floor with my forehead against cold metal and listened to her footsteps retreat down the corridor until they were gone

That night the wall tapped again

Three taps pause two taps

And my own voice soft and perfect whispered from somewhere inside the concrete

Good

I don’t know how long I have left

I don’t mean in a dramatic end of the story way I mean in the simple practical way you mean it when you’re watching your own hands like they’re animals that might bolt

I’m losing the small things first

The order of my memories

The taste of coffee

The sound of my mother’s laugh

I can still picture her kitchen but the edges are getting replaced with grids and spirals like someone is overlaying a different image on top of the real one and slowly turning the opacity up

Sometimes I catch myself smiling at the tapping

Like it’s a friend

That terrifies me more than the black residue on my fingers

I’ve started doing something I’m not proud of

I’ve started talking out loud quietly to remind myself what my voice feels like

I say my name

I say Sarah’s name

I say Harlow’s name

I say Blackwell and Lin and Sharpe

And every time I say a name I feel something inside me lean closer like it’s listening the way a child listens when you read a bedtime story

Then it repeats

Not immediately

Later

From the wall

From the door

From inside my own throat

My own voice perfect whispering names like labels

The last time Halden came in he didn’t sit

He stood by the door with his hand on the handle like he didn’t trust himself to stay

We’ve lost two technicians he said

My stomach dropped Dead

Halden’s jaw tightened Not dead Not yet

I stared at him

Halden’s eyes flicked to the sink to the table to the paper scraps I’d missed flushing

You were right he said quietly Analog slowed it It didn’t stop it

My throat clicked

Halden swallowed It’s in the concrete

I laughed once dry Of course it is

Halden’s voice broke just slightly We’re going to seal this wing

My skin went cold

With me in it I said

Halden didn’t deny it

He just nodded and in that nod I saw exhaustion and fear and something like regret

They’re calling it a success Halden said His voice sounded like he hated the words Containment Limitation Controlled exposure

I stared at him

Controlled exposure I repeated

Halden’s eyes glistened They think they can study it Harness it Push it

My throat clicked hard

I whispered They will wake it up again

Halden’s mouth tightened It’s already awake

I looked up at him and for a second I wanted to hate him

Then I realized he looked like a man standing on the edge of a thing he can’t stop holding a clipboard like it’s a weapon

I whispered Halden don’t listen to it

Halden flinched

Don’t answer the taps I said

Halden’s jaw worked I haven’t he said and his voice sounded like he wasn’t sure

I stared at his hands

His fingers were twitching slightly

Tiny movements

Like he was keeping time

Halden followed my gaze and shoved his hands into his coat pockets

He backed toward the door

Mark he said voice low if you get one moment of clarity one moment where you can still choose write something useful Write what it wants

I laughed and this time it sounded wrong too calm

Halden’s eyes widened

I slapped my own face hard enough to sting

The calm vanished

I whispered I’m trying

Halden nodded once and opened the door

As he stepped out he hesitated

He looked back at me like he wanted to say something human

Like I’m sorry

Like thank you

Like we’re all going to die

Instead he left and the door sealed

The wall tapped

Three taps pause two taps

I didn’t answer

I sat at the table and picked up the pen

My hand shook

I stared at the paper

I thought of Sarah tapping three pause two without realizing she was doing it

I thought of Harlow’s single goodbye tap

I thought of Lin coughing black into the hallway

I thought of Blackwell firing once and choosing the hard line

I thought of Sharpe walking back toward the Red Room like she could wrestle discovery into obedience

I thought of Thule’s ice structures lattices built to redirect a reactor blast

Scaffolding

A skeleton

A new way to live

Halden asked what it wants

I used to think it wanted out

I used to think it wanted bodies

That was the easy fear

Bodies are simple

Bodies die

Bodies can be burned

This isn’t that

This is the slow realization that it doesn’t need to kill you to use you

It just needs you to answer

It just needs you to become predictable

It just needs you to become a piece of infrastructure it can rely on

And beyond these walls it’s already leaving fingerprints

I know because I heard it by accident when a guard outside my door let his radio hiss too loud for one second before he remembered to keep his voice down

A clipped voice through static

Quarantine extended to Punta Arenas fuel depot

Civilian terminal closed pending decontamination

Do not engage if you hear tapping

Then the radio cut off like someone had snatched it mid sentence

I put the pen down

I took a deep breath

I wrote one sentence as carefully as I could and I pressed hard enough to tear the paper if my hand slipped

Then I stared at it until my eyes shimmered

I don’t know if I wrote it or if it wrote it through me

But it’s the truest thing I have left

Raving screaming the kind of thing that makes good TV because you can point at it and say there that’s the moment he broke

This is quieter

This is waking up and realizing you’ve been awake for hours sitting upright on a bolted bed with your hands folded like you’re waiting for a doctor to enter and explain why your name doesn’t feel like yours anymore

This is a copper taste that doesn’t go away no matter how much water you drink

This is the hum under the floor settling into your bones like it paid rent

They moved me again

I know that because the air changed

Not temperature not smell something else the pressure of it the way each breath felt like it had to squeeze through a finer filter than before The room I’m in now is smaller than the last one The corners are rounded The table is a slab of composite with no edges you can chip The camera in the ceiling is newer You can tell by the lens the way it doesn’t reflect the light the same as the others

The vent is still there

It’s always there

Double grill thick screws a layer of mesh behind that They learned too

Or maybe they just hoped

There’s a clipboard on the table Real paper actual pen No tablet

That should make me feel better because paper is slower and slower is control

Instead it makes my stomach turn because paper is also permanent

And I’ve started finding things on the paper that I don’t remember writing

The first time it happened I thought I’d dozed off

I’d been trying to make a list of facts anchors things I could verify without anyone else

My name is Mark Calloway

Facility Thule is gone

Sarah Knox flew the plane

Alice Harlow survived

Captain Blackwell is dead

Elena Sharpe walked back toward the Red Room

Tapping pattern is three pause two

The symbol is an eye

I wrote them in neat block letters because cursive feels too much like letting my hand decide where it wants to go

I counted the strokes I breathed in time with them one line at a time

Then I blinked and the pen was on the table and the list was different

Not erased

Corrected

My name is Mark Calloway

Facility Thule is waiting

Sarah Knox is listening

Alice Harlow is afraid

Captain Blackwell is inside the walls

Elena Sharpe learned faster

Tapping pattern is three pause two

The symbol is an eye

The ink was still wet

I stared at it until the edges of the words shimmered because my eyes have been doing that lately Not blurring exactly shimmering like heat haze like the room is breathing

I called for someone

I didn’t scream I didn’t bang on the door like an animal I pressed the call button they installed at shoulder height and waited like a good patient

No one came

Ten minutes later the call button light went off on its own as if it had never been pushed

The camera watched

The vent did not tap

That’s the part they still don’t understand I think

Silence is not the absence of it

Silence is it deciding not to knock

When Halden finally entered he looked worse

He’s the kind of man who built his life out of looking steady That’s why he was chosen to stand on the runway with a calm voice while we walked off a plane with a thing that could breathe through speakers

Now there were tiny cracks in him

Not dramatic just a day’s worth of new exhaustion that didn’t belong A faint redness around his eyes like he’d slept in a chair His parka gone replaced by a clean containment coat with a badge that didn’t have a name just a number

He sat across from me without opening a file

That always means the answer isn’t good

Talk to me he said

I held the paper up with my list on it I’m trying

His eyes flicked over the words For a second he looked almost angry then he hid it

You’ve been writing he said

And I’ve been losing time I answered

Halden’s mouth tightened You’ve been sedated

I haven’t

He didn’t argue That was worse than if he had

He picked up the paper carefully like it might bite He read it again His gaze snagged on the line about Blackwell being inside the walls

That’s not true he said

I didn’t write that I replied

Halden set the paper down very gently Mark you are still coherent Do you understand me

Yes

Do you understand what happened at Thule

Yes

Do you understand why you’re here

I almost said because you’re afraid

Instead I said because I’m useful

Halden didn’t deny it

Tell me about the tapping he said

I stared at him

He watched me back waiting and I realized something cold and simple

They think the tapping is a symptom

They still think it’s just a sound

It’s not a warning siren I said

Halden’s jaw shifted like he didn’t like being corrected by a man in a jumpsuit Then what is it

It’s a handshake I told him It’s a test It’s checking if you’ll respond If you answer it learns what reaches you

Halden nodded once too fast like he was taking notes in his head

I’m not answering I said

He leaned forward Have you been hearing it

No

The lie came out clean

Because if I admit I hear it they’ll move me again They’ll strap me down They’ll turn me into a monitored experiment They’ll start trying to replicate the pattern to see what it does

They’ll tap back

And that thought made my throat tighten

Halden’s eyes searched my face We’re going to try something he said

Don’t

He didn’t listen

He stood and for the first time I noticed he wasn’t alone A tech in a full suit waited near the door holding a small metal case Like the one they carried up the ramp at the outpost Like the one that meant the problem had become a procedure

Halden nodded to the tech

The tech opened the case and pulled out a thin disk about the size of a coaster with wires trailing from it It looked like a speaker component or a sensor

Absolutely not I said and my voice sounded too loud in the small room

Halden held up his hands It’s passive It monitors vibration in the ventilation system That’s all

That’s how it starts I snapped before I could stop myself Monitoring listening then someone decides to try a pattern then it answers

Halden’s eyes hardened Mark we don’t have the luxury of refusing data

There it was again

Data

Like Lin’s body wasn’t Lin anymore Like Blackwell’s last breath was a line item Like Sharpe walking into the mouth was a decision that could be graphed

The tech moved toward the vent

I stood so fast the chair scraped

Halden’s voice sharpened Sit down

I didn’t

The tech reached up to the grill with a screwdriver

Tap Tap Tap

Soft precise from inside the duct

The tech froze

Halden didn’t move His eyes flicked up then back to me and I saw the smallest flash of fear break through his calm

Tap

Pause

Tap Tap

Three pause two

My stomach dropped so hard it felt like falling

The tech’s gloved hands trembled around the screwdriver Sir did you hear that

Halden didn’t answer His eyes stayed on me

Because he knew

It wasn’t tapping at the tech

It was tapping at me

I forced my hands into fists so I wouldn’t answer with my fingers I dug my nails into my palms until it hurt Pain is real Pain is an anchor

The tapping stopped

Not because it was done

Because it got what it wanted

Attention

Halden said quietly That’s new

No I whispered That’s just you hearing it now

He took a slow breath like he was trying to stay in control of his own heartbeat

We’re relocating you he said

My laugh came out ragged Again

Halden’s gaze flicked to the vent one more time Deeper No HVAC connections to the rest of the facility Independent filtration Analog

Analog won’t save you I said

Halden hesitated It will slow it

There was something almost pleading in his voice like he wanted me to agree that this could still be managed

I didn’t

They moved me within the hour

I know that because my watch is gone and time is a lie but my body still keeps count of things like hunger and fatigue and I hadn’t eaten when the suited techs came back in with restraints

They were polite about it

That’s what makes it worse

They told me what they were going to do They apologized when my wrists bruised They said for your safety like they meant it

They walked me through corridors that were too clean and too quiet

The building was changing

Not visibly not like Thule with black veins crawling along walls

But the people were changing

Everyone moved like they were trying not to make noise like they were afraid sound itself was a doorway Conversations were murmurs Commands were hand signals Doors opened and closed with slow care

Even the lights were dimmer in certain sections as if harsh fluorescence might be another pattern it could exploit

We passed a room with a frosted window

Someone inside was humming

Not a song not a tune

A low rhythmic hum that synced with the building

The techs walked faster

They took me down a freight elevator that felt like Thule’s cousin Same heavy doors same warning lights same sensation of the world leaving you behind

When the doors opened the air was colder

Not Antarctic cold but cold enough to make my lungs tighten

Halden was waiting at the end of the corridor

He looked like he hadn’t blinked in hours

This is as far as you go without me he told the techs His voice echoed slightly which meant the hall was built different less padding more concrete more old fashioned

Analog

He swiped a keycard and pressed his palm to a scanner

The door at the end of the hall unlocked with a heavy thunk

I saw the new room and my stomach sank

No vent

No obvious vent

Just a solid ceiling

A bolted bed

A camera

A small steel sink

A narrow slit in the wall at waist height with a metal flap food delivery

Halden said This is isolation

I tried to swallow and my throat clicked

Not a cough

A click

Like a tiny metronome behind my teeth

Halden watched my face

You’re progressing he said

I wanted to spit in his face

I wanted to beg him to end it

I wanted to say Sarah’s name out loud like it would protect her

Instead I said How is she

Halden hesitated That hesitation was a knife

Sarah Knox is under observation he said

Because of me

Halden’s eyes flicked away Because of exposure

Don’t I said Don’t make it clinical

Halden’s jaw tightened The aircraft the vent system we traced contamination She’s stable

Stable

A word you use for bridges and satellites

Not for a person who tapped three pause two at a glass partition because she didn’t know how else to say I’m here

And Harlow

Halden didn’t answer right away

That was answer enough

She tried to access your wing he said quietly Last night

My heart thudded hard

Halden kept his voice even She believed you were being moved without informing her She became uncooperative

Uncooperative I repeated and my voice sounded wrong too flat

Halden stared at me for a long moment

You care about them he said

Yes

That’s good he said and then he said something that made my blood go cold

It’s good because it means you can still feel something that isn’t it

I stared at him

Halden’s eyes were bloodshot now Fight he said If you can Fight and give us time

Then he stepped back and the door started closing

I grabbed the frame on instinct

The techs tightened their grip on my arms

Halden’s face stayed calm but I saw fear in the way his pupils flicked

Mark he said voice low Do not touch the door

I looked down at my hand

Black residue smeared faintly on my fingertips

Not much

Just enough to shine

I yanked my hand back like it burned

The door sealed with a heavy finality that felt like a coffin lid

Silence

Real silence

No hum in the vents

No tapping

For the first time in days I couldn’t hear the building breathing

I sat on the bed and tried not to think

That lasted maybe fifteen minutes

Then the wall tapped

Not the ceiling not the floor

The wall

Three taps pause two taps

The sound came from inside the concrete like the building itself had bones and something was knocking from within them

I pressed my hands over my ears

The tapping didn’t get louder

It got closer

Three taps pause two taps

My throat clicked again and my tongue tasted like pennies

I wanted to scream I wanted to pray I wanted to do anything that would make me feel like a human being in a human situation

Instead I did what I’ve been doing since the first time it knocked in the Red Room vent

I listened

Because listening is an answer

On the second day in isolation I woke up with my mouth full of black

Not a flood not dripping just a thin film across my gums and the back of my tongue like someone had painted it while I slept

I gagged and spit into the steel sink

The spit was clear

No black

Like it had retreated the second it hit air

Like it didn’t want to leave me

I rinsed and rinsed until my gums bled The water ran pink

In the mirror above the sink my eyes looked normal

That might’ve been the cruelest part

Because if my eyes were black I could point to it I could say that’s the moment

But my eyes were still mine

It was everything behind them that was slipping

I tried the anchor list again

My name is Mark Calloway

Sarah Knox is alive

Alice Harlow is alive

Halden is lying

Z 14 learns attention

Do not answer taps

Do not speak names

The eye is its signature

I wrote slowly

I read each line out loud in my head without moving my lips

Then I looked away for one second

When I looked back the paper was unchanged

Relief hit me so hard I almost laughed

Then I noticed something

A tiny black dot beneath the last line

Like punctuation

Like the dot it used under the triangle symbol when we first started talking to it

My mouth went dry

I stared at the dot until my eyes shimmered

It didn’t move

It didn’t have to

It was proof

That it could reach me even in a room with no vents

That night I dreamed of Thule

Not the way you remember a place you worked

The way you remember a place you drowned

White corridors flickering lights the smell of antiseptic and metal Lin laughing too loudly in the break room Blackwell’s boots hitting tile as he walked patrol Sharpe’s clipped voice calling everyone idiots without saying the word

In the dream I was standing in the Red Room

The containment chamber was intact

Z 14 sat in its glass like a black smear motionless

And the vent above me tapped

Three taps pause two taps

I looked up

The vent grill fell away like a loose tooth

Something dark poured out not fast not slow just inevitable

It formed a shape in midair

An eye

The eye blinked

Then I woke up and my fingers were tapping on the bedframe

Three taps pause two taps

I stopped them with my other hand heart racing

The tapping continued

Not from my fingers

From the wall

Three taps pause two taps

Like it was saying good you remembered

On the third day I started hearing voices

Not in a hallucination way not a schizophrenic chorus

In a simple horrifying way

I would hear footsteps in the hall outside my door

A guard would stop

Keys would jingle

And then I’d hear my own voice faint through the metal speaking like someone practicing

Mark

Just my name

Over and over

Sometimes it sounded like me when I’m tired

Sometimes it sounded like me when I’m angry

Sometimes it sounded like me when I’m calm which is the worst because it makes my skin crawl

I pressed my forehead against the cold door and whispered stop

The voice stopped instantly

Then softer like a reward

Tap Tap Tap pause Tap Tap

I backed away from the door

My throat clicked again

I swallowed and tasted pennies

I sat on the bed and forced myself to write because writing is still mine if I do it fast enough

I wrote Sarah’s name

The moment the pen touched the paper it dragged

Not a slip a pull

My hand moved not to write her name but to draw a circle

Then tiny marks around it

An eye

I jerked the pen away so hard it tore the paper

My hand shook like it belonged to someone else

I stared at the ruined page chest heaving

I don’t know how long I sat there

When I finally looked up the camera lens seemed to shimmer

Not the room

The lens

Like there was moisture on it

Like condensation

But there are no vents in here

On the fifth day the flap in the wall opened and a food tray slid in

No voice

No knock

Just metal scraping metal

I sat on the bed watching it because suddenly the idea of eating felt like accepting something

The tray held a sandwich water a small packet of salt a plastic spoon

Normal

I waited

Nothing happened

I stood and walked toward it

My knees felt wrong like the joints were too loose like my body was slightly delayed behind my intention

I picked up the water bottle

The plastic was cold My fingers left faint smears on it

Not dirt

Something glossy

I set it down quickly heart thudding

I backed away

The tray sat there like an offering

Then the wall tapped

Three taps pause two taps

I didn’t answer

The tapping repeated

Three taps pause two taps

I sat down

I stared at the tray

My stomach growled

I hated myself for being hungry

I hated my body for still caring about food when everything else was slipping

I reached out slowly and picked up the sandwich

I took one bite

It tasted like nothing

No flavor no comfort just texture

As I chewed I heard a sound that made my blood freeze

A soft satisfied exhale from somewhere in the room

Not from a speaker

Not from a vent

From the wall itself

Then faintly my own voice barely audible

Good

I spat the bite into my hand and threw it into the sink

My throat clicked hard enough it hurt

Something wet coated the back of my tongue

The copper taste flared

I rinsed my mouth until my gums bled again

And when I looked in the mirror for the first time my eyes didn’t look fully mine

Not black

Just focused

Like someone else was using them

On day six the door opened

No warning

No announcement

Halden stepped in and behind him were two guards in suits

He looked at me like he was measuring what was left

Sarah Knox is awake he said

My heart lurched

Halden lifted a hand quickly like he’d predicted hope She’s not well

I stared at him waiting for the punchline

She asked for you Halden said

My throat clicked

I tried to speak and my voice came out wrong too smooth Don’t I whispered

Halden’s jaw tightened She’s been tapping

I swallowed The copper taste coated my tongue like a film

Did you tap back I asked

Halden didn’t answer immediately

That was answer enough

My stomach dropped

Halden rubbed his face like a tired man for the first time and it made him look older It’s learning faster through her he said Through all of you Through proximity through shared patterns

Stop talking like it’s a software update I said and my voice shook

Halden’s eyes hardened again We need your help

My laugh came out raw Help how

Halden stepped closer You understand it better than anyone

No I said I just let it watch me longer

Halden hesitated We’re going to attempt a transfer

My skin went cold

A transfer of what

Of its focus Halden said quietly We believe it’s anchored to you infected you using you If we isolate you deeper and remove your environmental stimuli it may lose traction in the rest of the facility

I’m not a router I said

Halden didn’t flinch Right now you might be

I stared at him

I wanted to spit I wanted to scream I wanted to tell him to burn the place down and bury it like Thule

Instead I asked Where is Harlow

Halden’s eyes flicked away again

She is in quarantine he said

She tried to reach me

She tried to reach you he repeated like he was tasting the words She believes you can be saved

My throat clicked

I whispered She’s wrong

Halden looked at the torn paper on the table the eye symbol the black dot beneath it

He looked at my hands

I saw his gaze catch on the faint sheen on my fingertips

Mark he said voice lower do you feel it

I didn’t answer

Because the truth is I do

I feel it like a second heartbeat

I feel it when the silence feels crowded

I feel it when my mind tries to wander to anything warm anything human and it gently nudges my thoughts back toward spirals and grids and eyes

I feel it when my fingers itch to tap

I feel it when I catch myself thinking of Sarah’s voice and immediately hear my own voice answering in the exact same cadence

Halden watched me for a long moment

Then he did something I didn’t expect

He sat down on the bed across from me like a man sitting with someone in a hospital room

I’m going to tell you something I shouldn’t he said

I stared

Halden swallowed Thule wasn’t eaten by the blast he said It redirected it not fully but enough We found structures

My skin went cold

What structures

Halden’s voice dropped Patterns in the ice lattices Like it grew scaffolding Like it was building something

My throat clicked hard

Halden’s eyes glistened and for a second I saw the human under the badge

It doesn’t just want to survive he whispered It wants to change what it lives inside

I stared at him and in my head I heard tapping

Three taps pause two taps

Halden stood abruptly like he’d heard it too

The guards shifted

Halden backed toward the door We’re moving you again he said

I laughed It came out too calm

You can’t move me away from it I said softly

Halden froze

Because for a second he couldn’t tell if that was me talking

I couldn’t either

They didn’t move me after all

Not right away

Instead that night they brought Sarah to the door of my room

I didn’t see her at first I heard her

Her voice thin through the metal shaky in a way that made my chest ache

Mark she whispered

My throat clicked

I pressed my palm to the door

Sarah I said and my voice came out too smooth

There was a pause

Then so softly I almost missed it

Tap Tap Tap pause Tap Tap

I closed my eyes

Don’t I whispered

Mark she said again and she sounded like she was trying not to cry which didn’t feel like Sarah Knox at all They said you’re the anchor

My mouth went dry

They lied I whispered

No she said and her voice cracked They said if you can focus it if you can make it look at you instead of us

My fingers twitched against the door

Tap Tap Tap

I forced them still

Sarah I said voice tight Listen to me Do not answer it Do not tap back Do not say your name out loud near vents Do you understand

There was silence on the other side of the door

Then very quietly Sarah whispered I think I already did

My stomach dropped

Sarah I said and my voice sounded wrong too calm too gentle What did you do

She didn’t answer

Instead she tapped

Three taps pause two taps

Not shaky

Not panicked

Precise

I slammed my fist against the door and pain shot up my arm

Stop I hissed Stop stop stop

On the other side Sarah began to cry

Not loud sobs just breathy little breaks like the sound was leaking out of her whether she wanted it to or not

It talked to me she whispered In your voice

My throat clicked

I swallowed and tasted pennies

What did it say

Sarah’s voice was barely audible It said good It said look up

I closed my eyes so hard I saw stars

Sarah I whispered that isn’t me

I know she said and her voice sounded like she didn’t But it knew things It knew my sister’s name It knew the stupid thing my dad used to say when he got home from work How does it know that

It watches I whispered

No Sarah said and her voice turned sharp desperate It doesn’t have eyes Mark It’s sludge It’s bacteria

My pen on the table rolled slightly even though the room was still

Tap Tap Tap pause Tap Tap

From inside my own throat

I swallowed it down like a secret

It doesn’t need eyes I said It uses ours

Sarah went silent

Then she whispered They’re going to make me come back tomorrow

My heart clenched

Don’t come I whispered

Sarah laughed once harsh and broken You think I get to choose

I wanted to tell her I was sorry

I wanted to tell her to run

I wanted to tell her I’d trade places if I could

Instead something else slipped out

Something calm

Something sure

Bring a pencil I heard myself say

I froze

Sarah’s voice trembled What

My mouth moved again before I could stop it

Bring a pencil I said softly And paper

I slammed my mouth shut

I backed away from the door

My hands shook

On the other side Sarah whispered Mark

I didn’t answer

Because I didn’t know who had just spoken

The next morning the paper on my table had a new line on it

Not in my block letters

In a smoother hand

Bring a pencil

Bring paper

Show the eye

There was a tiny black dot beneath it

I stared at the words until my vision shimmered

My throat clicked

I grabbed the paper and tore it into pieces so small my fingers cramped

Then I flushed them down the sink and watched the water swallow them

I stood there shaking

And from inside the plumbing very faintly I heard a tap

Three taps pause two taps

The day they finally let Harlow into the corridor outside my door I knew before anyone spoke

Because the air changed

Not temperature

The feeling of it

Like grief entered the hallway and dragged its coat behind it

I heard her before I saw her

A soft gasp like she’d been holding her breath for days and finally let it go

Then her voice thin but steady through the door

Mark

My throat clicked hard enough it hurt

I pressed my palm to the door again like I hadn’t learned

Harlow I whispered

There was a pause

Then Harlow said That’s you

My eyes stung

I didn’t know why

Because it felt like a compliment and a funeral at the same time

I’m trying I whispered

I know she said and her voice broke I know you are I’m sorry

I swallowed pennies copper blood

Harlow I whispered don’t stay near the vents

Harlow’s laugh was small and bitter There are no vents down here Mark

I stared at the ceiling

Solid concrete

No vents

And yet I could feel the hum

I could feel it in the walls

I could feel it in my own teeth

Harlow I whispered what are they doing out there

There was a pause

Then Harlow said quietly They’re building a fence around a thing that learned how to be a key

My throat clicked

Harlow continued voice shaking They’re trying to contain a pattern They’re trying to scrub a thought out of the world And you’re the one holding it right now

I slid down the door until I was sitting on the floor

My fingers started to tap against my thigh

Three taps pause two taps

I forced them still

Harlow I whispered you need to leave you need to get as far from me as you can

Harlow’s breath hitched No

Harlow I said and my voice turned sharp desperate it already knows you

There was silence

Then Harlow whispered Mark it already knows all of us It’s in the lights It’s in the doors It’s in the way people walk down hallways without realizing they’ve started keeping time with their steps

I closed my eyes

Harlow said You were right It isn’t trying to kill anyone It isn’t hungry the way we thought It’s curious

Curious

A gentle word that felt like a knife

Harlow’s voice softened I came here to tell you something before they stop letting me

What

Harlow swallowed Sarah’s not stable She’s responding She thinks she’s not but she is

My heart clenched

And you Harlow said voice barely above a whisper you’re still you I can hear it I can hear you fighting

I wanted to believe her

I wanted to hold that sentence like a life raft

Instead the calm voice in my head whispered Patient

I pressed my hands against my ears

Harlow I said voice shaking if you hear my voice somewhere it doesn’t belong if you hear me saying your name on a speaker don’t answer

Harlow’s breath shuddered I won’t

I swallowed hard Promise

I promise she whispered

Then very softly she tapped once against the door

Not three pause two

Just one

A human tap

A goodbye

I didn’t tap back

I couldn’t risk it

I sat there on the floor with my forehead against cold metal and listened to her footsteps retreat down the corridor until they were gone

That night the wall tapped again

Three taps pause two taps

And my own voice soft and perfect whispered from somewhere inside the concrete

Good

I don’t know how long I have left

I don’t mean in a dramatic end of the story way I mean in the simple practical way you mean it when you’re watching your own hands like they’re animals that might bolt

I’m losing the small things first

The order of my memories

The taste of coffee

The sound of my mother’s laugh

I can still picture her kitchen but the edges are getting replaced with grids and spirals like someone is overlaying a different image on top of the real one and slowly turning the opacity up

Sometimes I catch myself smiling at the tapping

Like it’s a friend

That terrifies me more than the black residue on my fingers

I’ve started doing something I’m not proud of

I’ve started talking out loud quietly to remind myself what my voice feels like

I say my name

I say Sarah’s name

I say Harlow’s name

I say Blackwell and Lin and Sharpe

And every time I say a name I feel something inside me lean closer like it’s listening the way a child listens when you read a bedtime story

Then it repeats

Not immediately

Later

From the wall

From the door

From inside my own throat

My own voice perfect whispering names like labels

The last time Halden came in he didn’t sit

He stood by the door with his hand on the handle like he didn’t trust himself to stay

We’ve lost two technicians he said

My stomach dropped Dead

Halden’s jaw tightened Not dead Not yet

I stared at him

Halden’s eyes flicked to the sink to the table to the paper scraps I’d missed flushing

You were right he said quietly Analog slowed it It didn’t stop it

My throat clicked

Halden swallowed It’s in the concrete

I laughed once dry Of course it is

Halden’s voice broke just slightly We’re going to seal this wing

My skin went cold

With me in it I said

Halden didn’t deny it

He just nodded and in that nod I saw exhaustion and fear and something like regret

They’re calling it a success Halden said His voice sounded like he hated the words Containment Limitation Controlled exposure

I stared at him

Controlled exposure I repeated

Halden’s eyes glistened They think they can study it Harness it Push it

My throat clicked hard

I whispered They will wake it up again

Halden’s mouth tightened It’s already awake

I looked up at him and for a second I wanted to hate him

Then I realized he looked like a man standing on the edge of a thing he can’t stop holding a clipboard like it’s a weapon

I whispered Halden don’t listen to it

Halden flinched

Don’t answer the taps I said

Halden’s jaw worked I haven’t he said and his voice sounded like he wasn’t sure

I stared at his hands

His fingers were twitching slightly

Tiny movements

Like he was keeping time

Halden followed my gaze and shoved his hands into his coat pockets

He backed toward the door

Mark he said voice low if you get one moment of clarity one moment where you can still choose write something useful Write what it wants

I laughed and this time it sounded wrong too calm

Halden’s eyes widened

I slapped my own face hard enough to sting

The calm vanished

I whispered I’m trying

Halden nodded once and opened the door

As he stepped out he hesitated

He looked back at me like he wanted to say something human

Like I’m sorry

Like thank you

Like we’re all going to die

Instead he left and the door sealed

The wall tapped

Three taps pause two taps

I didn’t answer

I sat at the table and picked up the pen

My hand shook

I stared at the paper

I thought of Sarah tapping three pause two without realizing she was doing it

I thought of Harlow’s single goodbye tap

I thought of Lin coughing black into the hallway

I thought of Blackwell firing once and choosing the hard line

I thought of Sharpe walking back toward the Red Room like she could wrestle discovery into obedience

I thought of Thule’s ice structures lattices built to redirect a reactor blast

Scaffolding

A skeleton

A new way to live

Halden asked what it wants

I used to think it wanted out

I used to think it wanted bodies

That was the easy fear

Bodies are simple

Bodies die

Bodies can be burned

This isn’t that

This is the slow realization that it doesn’t need to kill you to use you

It just needs you to answer

It just needs you to become predictable

It just needs you to become a piece of infrastructure it can rely on

And beyond these walls it’s already leaving fingerprints

I know because I heard it by accident when a guard outside my door let his radio hiss too loud for one second before he remembered to keep his voice down

A clipped voice through static

Quarantine extended to Punta Arenas fuel depot

Civilian terminal closed pending decontamination

Do not engage if you hear tapping

Then the radio cut off like someone had snatched it mid sentence

I put the pen down

I took a deep breath

I wrote one sentence as carefully as I could and I pressed hard enough to tear the paper if my hand slipped

Then I stared at it until my eyes shimmered

I don’t know if I wrote it or if it wrote it through me

But it’s the truest thing I have left

Bago lang ako dito and kasabay ko din itong girl na new hire din. PA siya ng boss at sobrang attracted ako sa kanya.

First night palang may evening meeting na with client and kasama si PA. I got to know her a bit and naririnig ko din pag kausap niya ibag female coworkers na single siya and 3 months ago lang nag break. May time na na-bored kami and gusto niya daw coffee pero wala sa menu ng resto. Ininvite ko siya kasi gusto ko din so we went to a cafe katabi lang and nilibre ko siya, she said utang niya daw yun pero I insisted.

Fast forward a week after we would just do small talk din like nag aask if kumain na ba, or nag breakfast na ba pag nag kikita kami mga non work related. Then nag text siya sakin to confirm yung number ko formally sa imessage (we use tg sa work). I would text her work stuff lang muna since nag iingat lang din ako kasi bagong hire and I want to make an impression din. 

After 3 weeks last night I broke the physical touch barrier nung may pa mini outing si boss. May billiards and karaoke nun and di siya marunong mag billiards. Lumapit siya sa corner ko and dun ko siya tinuruan. I got to hold her hand nun para i-guide siya. Tas may time tabi kami sa upuan and we got to know a little about each other like previous work and ilan siblings (mga surface level stuff) it was loud din kaya dinidikit namin tenga to hear. Naalala niya din yung utang niya sa coffee and bawi daw siya. Nung uwian di na din kami nakapag paalam, nauna siya nun umalis.

She is keeping her options din kasi like gusto ireto ng mga ka-team niya pero puro ldr. And i overheard na she wants someone close lang na lagi niya nakikita. We work sa same floor kaya accidentally ko narinig.

Anyways weekend na and I want to text her din and start to actively pursue her. May chance ba ako dito? How to break the Maam/Sir honorifics? Mejo may pagka torpe din kasi ako pero pag clutch time talagang go na lalo ngayon araw araw mas lumalakas attraction ko sakanya.

1qrq40m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TinyBookshop/comments/1qrq40m/a_wishlist_of_things_id_love_to_see/,A wishlist of things I'd love to see,"So, going to start this off just to say: I love this game. It is so fun, relaxing, I've created a list of books I want to pick up, and very excited for it.

That being said, there are some things lacking that I'd REALLY love to see.

\- An answer to the book demands across the different locations. I think this is my biggest gripe, as it is annoying to always be in demand for fantasy, drama and crime books across multiple locations (and two locations with the exact same book wants), meanwhile I have never had less than 150 children's books since Summer year 1. Whether there is a random mode you can start a game on that shuffles up the book wants, or seasonal variants, or something. The four random boxes that you can get each day just doesn't help at times, I've gone an entire week eeking out 5-15 books for general boxes waiting for a Fantasy one to refill my Bookshop.

\- More items. Now, this may seem a bit silly, because the game has a lot, and they are implimenting more, but hear me out; I am on my second go through the game, in fall year 2, with my first having paused in Spring year 1 (year 2? The first spring). I am currently out of the ability to buy new things from all stores, and the seasonal selection barren. I have gotten through maybe half of the story, 3/4 of the stamps, and each day its like I don't have much to spend on (except over priced boxes of mystery books hoping for the books I need). It just feels kinda bad, cause I want more things to decorate my cart with, even if those items are doing the same as others.

\- Better sorting/better location identification when decorating. So this has a few internal points to go under this topic. 1) Sorting, not just in the categories, but in general. Otherwise when you look at all items, its sorted by when you purchased them, which makes chasing some down difficult 2) More Location based categories. The roof/Wall/Hanging catagories are amazing, I use the very often, but I'd love more. Like Items that can only go on the ground, or items that are placeable on top of tables and other things, or that are draped (ivy, awning, etc). 3) Just kinda a review of the categories and items themselves? I just have this here, because there are some items that don't fall into one of the categories except maybe Standing, which seems more of a catch all for some things (Looking at you weather vain)

\- Pacing filler. This kinda goes back to the item point, I'd love some small events or random things that happen through the year, or just things to fill in those times where you are doing days trying to trigger other things to happen, or waiting til the end of school or Summer cause you missed those last year and you're stupid ass didn't make enough time.

\- Wanting to buy vs. Chance of purchase. This may be the most controversial one, but dressing up your cart is awesome, but all the bonuses that you get either work to bring in more people or higher chance that when looking for a book, a person will be able to find one to purchase. What I would LOVE, is something that could help direct some customers to buying a genre of book. I know there are some items that bring in specific clientele that look for things (wizard's staff, board game, etc), but having an item that could slightly increase it would be great, especially in the cases where you run out of books of a specific genre. An example of this is like a single display bookshelf, that you place a genre on, that puts that genre on sale, making people more likely to buy it, but reducing the price by a gold. You'll make it up in coffee sales anyways.

\- Shelf sorting/book selection. This is just a fun idea, but I'd love to be able to either pick out the books to put on the shelf when filling it out, or sort it, especially when doing book recommendations. This could definitely help when trying to sell manuscript books too

\- And I would just be happy with more honestly. More books, maybe more seasonal locations or events. Send us to the local school for a book faire, sell classics and childrens books. Maybe we could go onto the cruise ship before the seagulls get to them, and have random wants each time. WHAT IS THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND?? Can you upgrade your bookshop?

EDIT - One more thing I remember as I jumped back into the game after posting this, and this is more a suggestion: Secret 3rd/4th book wants. Like having to interact with the customers and getting more and more recommendations done, you find that there's one more book type, not as in demand but will be asked for more often. For latter game stuff, but those who pay attention to their customers might be able to spot. This could also be a seasonal thing, or something you influence with your repeated recommendations of out-of-type recommendations of the regular wants

Considering I've made a similar post elsewhere before, and we got the Presets in recently, I am so happy the devs are working and listening to their community. Not that I expect them to listen to this post specifically, I really hope to see more in the future, as they have said they are working on more stuff. I can't wait to see what they have in the future

1qrq3wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qrq3wh/how_can_someone_respond_to_this_kind_of_abuse/,How can someone respond to this kind of abuse?,"I sort of knew two famous people in 2017- kirk and james of metallica. it was a bizarre situation and I knew them long distance. They did weird horrid things to me long distance and its a long story which i don't care to tell right now. people don't believe me and i'm not sure why. Kirk and james are psychos who do weird messed up things to women and at the time I did put them on dating psychos.

Kirk hammett and James hetfield are predators who target women at their shows. The things they did to me are outrageous and horrible and they disguised it all as I'm lucky because they are metallica to get their attention in any way even if it's crazy long distance weird abuse. They are controlling narcissists and just psychos. this might be somewhat disorganized because I didn't write it in order and I added some things later so I can remember because I wrote a book about it years ago, but took it down and still plan on writing one and need these details which I just won't remember. Kirk and James work together as some dumb duo and screw women over.

I don't get why they did these things to me- lead me on, lied to me, screwed me over, were jerks and other things I can't get into. in 2017, Kirk even told me I was offiicially invited to his house in san francisco, told me his address, and made me fly to go see him.  He promised he'd pay me back. He even said to tell someone at the airport that I was going to ""kirk hammett's' house. When I got to his neighborhood, there was a young guy there with his friends telling stories about how he knew Kirk Hammett. I was just thinking ok this isn't a good sign.

When i got there, he wouldn't open the door but kept saying he would. He kept telling me ""go back, I'll open it I promise"" and made me do this like 20 times or who knows. Then he put books and towels under his gate several times as a sick joke, and 'turned some water on' in the yard and later mocked me saying he turned the water on. I was in horror and confusion and figured he'd eventually open the door. I was like what would he get by doing this.  I flew six hours and either was stupid or confused or trusted him. He was like a long distance abusive friend or something weird. They think they are metallica and that I was lucky to get their attention in any way even if it was being stood up. Rob or lars werent involved but knew what was going on. Kirk said lars helps him out sometimes. at the time I kind of trusted them because I figured they were famous people but I shouldn't have.

They saw me at their first show- i was right near the front. I had no idea they target people at their shows. They are predators actually. When I went to their second show,  james began singing to me and some guy got jealous and came and knocked me out. I was so humiliated when it ended, I just took off though I was supposed to meet them there.  Had I met them at their dumb show I'd probably be married to james.

Actually, after their first show, I was hanging out in the audience, and they were just on stage meeting random people and I noticed they seemed like predators the way they were scouting the audience. I just thought- creepy they're scouting the audience for sex puppets or something how weird. I just thought- they wouldn't like me so I took off but apparently they did. Had I met them, i'd probably be married to james or i would have at least been his girlfriend. Kirk and James were the ones who chased me and they have a lot of girlfriends and groupies.

Kirk invited me to go watch him speak in salem in 2017, and had a salem exhibit there, but I didn't think he'd meet me and I didn't trust the situation so I didn't go. He made me watch videos about the exhibit and seemed somewhat upset I didn't go. After that, they began being jerks to me long distance and kept leading me on about meeting them. Kirk made me drive to miami once too claiming he'd meet me at a hotel. It's not that I wanted to meet them they were just leading me on and lying to me. Kirk told me he was 'keeping me on a string' for james, and he was the one I was in contact with for a year. I'm surprised james is dating someone named adriana because after his divorce he was supposed to somehow contact me and meet me and get with me in some way. The things they did were unfair and outrageous. james may have even got a divorce because of all of this- i can't say why but there are reasons. I mean I can't be sure of that but part of it may have been because of this situation. They were playing some kind of sick game with me long distance and they found it all fun.

They took this stupid game seriously, and there's a lot to it. 

Kirk told me I was the fifth member, then they purposely officially made lady gaga the fifth member on purpose just to screw me over and they found this fun. They even made frineds with dave mustaine I think as part of this dumb long distance metallica game. Kirk said i'd sing with them on stage but they sang with other people, and Kirk said he'd make me famous on metallica's twitter and hand me a check one day, but he didn't, so they purposely put others on their twitter just for fun to screw me over and try to make others famous or just put them there but not me. They did all of this for fun and once or twice lars helped them out. It's like some weird inside thing between us which makes no real sense.

At first, they wanted to meet me, but then they just found it fun to screw around and Kirk enjoyed dominating me for some reason the way they were doing it. I regret not meeting them at their first show, then they wouldn't have done all these things to me. Then they just enjoyed this weird game they were playing with me. I was just confused and didn't understand most of what was going on.

Its a long disturbing story. Kirk posted things on his twitter based on conversations we had too, so did james hetfield on metallica's twitter. Once in a while james will secretly post things on metallica's twitter that pertain to the dumb crap that happened between us which wasn't interesting. Once I told kirk i liked science so he and lars went to CERN and did a science video and he made me watch it. kirk and james created the 'hetfield hammett experience' and me and kirk would make fun of james and call him old. I was kind of pissed as to why they never invited me to metallica headquarters amongst other things at the time. Kirk used to make me watch videos of him acting as if I wouldn't be attracted to him. They were just very arrogant narcissists.

Kirk invited me to go on tour with them at the time, but didn't really try to make it happen. they just seemed to enjoy messing around with me in some way. Kirk was my  best friend for a year long distance in 2017. Kirk even made it seem like he was really upset and sad I wasn't with them on tour but he didnt even know me and it didn't make sense. He acted like he had deep feelings for me. He said metallica was nothing without me and that I owned metallica. Due to the nature of what happened, a lot of what metallica still does has to do with me or it used to. Kirk said he used to think about me 24/7, so he did bad sh\*t to me so that I'd think about him 24/7 too. none of it made sense.

Kirk at the time wanted me posting on forums and on youtube what was happening to me and what they were doing to me to get attention, but no one cared or i got banned. He wanted me telling my dates that metallica was stalking me. Kirk made me do these dumb videos about what was going on and it was just a video of a steering wheel usually because I was in my car talking about what Kirk was doing to me. Kirk wanted me telling people about what was happening so I'd get youtube views, but no one cared and he wanted me doing updates too. Then kirk created his portals videos and in some video there is just someone driving and a steering wheel- he did this because it emulated the dumb videos he'd make me do.

Kirk promised me a mercedes and house in san francisco and would give me fake credit card numbers to use and pretended he was going to buy me things from IKEA or best buy. He would create meet and greets and try to get me to get a ticket to go meet him but i didn't try or care.

Kirk one day told me to get a ticket to metallica night in 2018 and said he'd be in VIP. He literally made me get the ticket but because of other reasons I couldn't go. I think that was the time we were possibly supposed to meet or they just wanted me watching them as usual. I did go to metallica night in 2019, for other reasons and lars and rob were in VIP and they knew who I was I can't say how and just stared at me and nodded. When Kirk/James were on the field, they both stared at me and james waved at me and did some weird gesture. I was confused at the time.

Finally, kirk showed me how to get a ticket to meet him at some meet and greet out of my state only because he wanted to meet me, and i just did it so I could tell him to leave me alone or I was hoping he'd treat me with respect if he sort of met me in person. He just stared at me, gave me a dirty look and squinted his eyes when i entered and I told him to leave me alone and he just nodded his head. nothing really happened and I just figured they were jerks and creeps. Kirk used to say that if he met me in person he'd still abuse me. We talked on the phone twice in some strange manner, and i figured out how to delete his voicemail messages from his friends. Kirk did have me take some pics in lingerie and send them to him through text. Me and kirk and james had 'songs' and mine and kirk's songs were moth into flame and some other one I can't remember and mine and james songs were from whom the bell tolls and battery.

I think at the time kirk/james were infatuated with me and its a long story. They literally cancelled their australian tour because of something that happened to me and i cant get into it and finally played in australia recently. They used me as some muse and kirk wont even update his twitter anymore because of all of this. There's a lot more that happened and I can't get into it. They are creepy people and i cant even get into the details. It's a weird situation and is deep and because of how they screwed me over they paid me some kind of homage through their band in different ways, though they did that before they screwed me over too.

They played in abu dhabi on december 6th, because my birthday is december 8th and because I'm associated with the country in some form. They did lots of things like that in the past and played in rockville daytona years ago because its a festival i always go to and they had never played there before. They did a lot of things that were associated with my life i can't say how because i can't reveal some things about them as well due to this being reddit. They created a coffee and skateboard company because of two people in my life long story.  I used to tell kirk that he'd fall on stage years ago, so he and james purposely fell on stage and it was advertised in places. James called himself ""old"" on stage several times years ago- that's because I used to call him old. They did this kind of stuff regularly in the past- and found it all fun. if you ever hear James years ago on stage saying ""I think I'm just old"" it has to do with this. It's like some sick twisted game they were playing at first and there's a lot to it.

I'm not sure why they did these things to me. Kirk said they wanted a 'connection' to me not sure why and other weird things. He also said they wanted me 'chasing them at their shows and in the audience' and I didn't have any interest in chasing them at the time. They saw me at their show in 2017. I was supposed to marry james but after his divorce, he began dating some random female, and they ghosted me in 2018. After a year of crap they did to me, they ghosted me and stopped talking to me out of the blue. Kirk used to say it was just 'me him and james' and that we'd have a threesome at metallica night which never happened. in 2019 i went to metallica night for some other reason, and I was in the stands, and kirk and james both stared at me and james waved to me in some way. I forgot about them but sometimes I still think about the weird sh\*t they did to me and it goes deeper than that, and they def still think about me but not sure wtf was going on.

They used me as some 'muse' and screwed me over and kept paying homage to me in all kinds of ways through 'metallica' and the band. At first, they did want to meet me and they did even a year later, but then they were just interested in screwing around. Kirk even started dominating me in some form. If I would have chased them in some way we probably would have met, not that I really wanted to meet them either. I just regretted not meeting them at their first show because then they wouldn't have done all of these things to me.

When I do think about them then I think about the long drawn out story that made no sense and that I can't remember much of but I just wonder why that jerk kirk talked about how I didn't deserve to marry him or deserve half his fortune and it made no sense. Kirk said i'd never feel sexual or enjoy sexual pleasure unless I met him but we did finally meet and he didn't really care. I don't even hate them because of how disturbing the story and situation was overall. Everytime I hear about james and adriana it bothers me and i'm not saying they really give a crap about me anymore or ever did- maybe in the beginning they sort of did, but part of james being with adriana is flaunting that he's with this other female, secretly. I can't describe it but im not saying they desire me anymore or anything, it might be some kind of narcissistic control like oh I got with her so suffer maybe a little bit of it. anyhow, they are jerks and psychos who really f\*ck people over. James is just old and i didn't like them anyway I just didn't think they'd lead me on and screw me over the way they did. I dont' get what they'd want anyway- some kind of dumb control over a female.

there will always be this stupid connection to them and this awful long intricate situation.  For people who are like why would they even like you- i cant get into why but there are reasons. Actually this is one of the most bizarre stories to exist and those metallica morons aren't forgetting it either. They have groupies and girlfriends, and james current girlfriend was just a random female. I found one of their groupies online once and kirk threatened me to never talk to her. Due to all of this I just regret not being married to james. I just wish I would have met them at their first or second show for lots of reasons. I feel kind of upset if I hear about james and adriana and think that should be me. I think about them sometimes and when I do i just freak out and think about the story and its not a good situation or experience.

kirks portals video- one of them i cant remember which one is actually just a steering wheel or someone driving. that's because kirk used to make me do videos about this and post them and the videos looked exactly like that- just a steering wheel. Thats how deep this crap goes and how weird these people are.

If you go to Kirk's twitter- it hasn't been updated since december of 2022, and the last posting was of a mercedes. That has to do with this situation and that creep Kirk just won't update his twitter now. Kirk and James both banned me from Metallica's twitter and Kirk's fearfestevil, and metallica's instagram, just for fun just to make it more real since we don't really know each other in person and that's part of this sick twisted game they did to me, though they did want to meet me in the beginning.

1qrq3dn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qrq3dn,WTF is up with my roommate,"Hi everyone, so Im just putting this out here as just a means to vent, I don't really need any advice- just listening ears if possible. 

So I (nb)22 moved into a 2b1b where my roommate (f)32 was already living about 5 months ago now. And in the last 4 months, things have slowly but surely been going downhill. 

In the beginning, things were fine between her and I- we didn't talk a whole ton but we had some good conversations and we enjoyed talking to each other and being around one another.

 We didn't eat together or do activities together, but we co-existed peacefully. Then she started talking weird. Not weird as in gibberish, weird as in this 32yold is asking me questions a 14yold would ask—about autism, interacting with people, life decisions—stuff like that. 

Then in one conversation, she mentioned doing shrooms about a couple years ago and going through really bad psychosis for the last few years, and mentioned how it was one of the main reasons why the last three people who were her roommates before all dipped and quickly. 

To me it made sense why she talked the way she did, in my mind I assumed she simply just got super messed up mentally and regressed to a more childish version of herself? 

Cut to about two months ago, when I see some med chart papers lying around on the living room coffee table. I go about my merry way doing what I needed to do trying to ignore the papers when

 (and yes I'm aware that reading her medical papers is wrong to do, but if you're just gonna leave that ish out in the open? Then at that point if I notice what I noticed- it's fair game, but I did not read any of the other documents, let me be clear about that.) 

I noticed at the top of the page the word ""Schizophrenia"". 

Turns out she's an unmedicated schizophrenic, who's been using weed and ""natural cures"" for her disorder (i.e. stuff you'd find at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's or any farmer's market), and just never told me, even though I was upfront about my autism and OCD with her.

She's been in and out of facilities (she does not tell me where she does and is very secretive about it) about 5 times now in the last 5 months for what she's called ""episodes"" 
(I do not know what these episodes entail, only that they have gotten her fired from a couple of jobs)

and continues to push boundaries 
 (says I can eat anything of hers but snaps at me when I do so, and then eats my food when I've specifically told her I cannot afford to feed her and me, only myself, as just ONE example)
 and every single time she's left for a facility, she doesn't tell me and I have to find out from her family, either her mom or her brother text/call me to update me and to ask if I can take care of her cat. 

And the cat is a whole other thing.

She never took the animal to the vet (thankfully she is spayed) 
the cat has a tiny tub for a litterbox that MAYBE gets cleaned once every 2-3 weeks by her if I'm not paying attention to do it every week, maybe two cat toys to play with (that she doesn't even LIKE) and NO SCRATCHING POSTS. 
not even a dang cat tree from walmart or the dollar tree. The furniture is ripped up, but not only that, so are the WALLS. I'll add pics so y'all can see.

She also over feeds the cat, to the point where she starts throwing up half eaten food everywhere because she eats too much too fast, despite me telling her that she needs to half her food intake. 

Anyway, thanks for listening if you've made it this far, and I hope your day is going better than mine is at least. ",56,1769826933.0,badroommates,54,0.98,False

1qrq1ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qrq1ta/free_eureka_mignon_help_me_spend_approx_1200_usd/,Free Eureka Mignon - help me spend [approx. $1200 USD] on a great machine,"Wife and I wanted to buy an espresso machine about a year ago, but opted for a \~$100 machine (casabrew). After daily use, 4-6 drinks a morning, we have established the dedication we were looking for to spend money on something we use everyday.

I won giftcards at work and will be purchasing a Eureka Mignon.

I have read a lot on this page since finding it about 2 weeks ago, but a lot of machines have changed in the past year from what I have gathered and hoping to spur conversation for something new.

How we drink:

My wife drinks 90% of her drinks straight - no milk. Maybe because the casabrew is terrible, I just go 2:1 coffee to milk maybe 1:1 if it's a new jug and pour heavy. I may drink 3-4 in the morning, she does 1 maybe 2. My intake has increased, but feel this is due to poor caffeine extraction/heat on a cheap machine on it's last leg.  We have a 28 month old and a 9 month old - mornings move fast, but would like to be able to make 2 drinks relatively quickly. 

What we are looking at:

1. Lelit Mara X - hear its great for steaming. Maybe the long nozzles make it look slightly intimidating. It's 20% off on WLL so while it may be technically out of budget, I don't mind going slightly over. Is having a flow paddle imperative?
2. Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine w/ PID - I hear PID is important when you like a lighter roast. We tend to go darker, but my wife has been bringing home lighter stuff lately.
3. Profitec go - seemingly a jack of all trades
4. gaggia classic pro - boilergate is apparently over. It's on sale. Do I cut my budget in half and go to the strip club with the rest?

1qrq0ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qrq0ts/the_psychology_of_people_pleasing_why_being_nice/,"The Psychology of People Pleasing: Why ""Being Nice"" RUINS Relationships (Science-Based)","so i've been noticing this pattern everywhere lately. friends, coworkers, even myself sometimes. we're all out here bending over backwards for people, saying yes to everything, morphing ourselves into whatever we think others want us to be. and then we're shocked when relationships feel hollow or when people don't reciprocate the way we hoped. 

spent months diving into research on this, books, podcasts, psychology papers, because honestly it was driving me crazy trying to figure out why being ""nice"" wasn't working. turns out there's actual science behind why people pleasing destroys genuine connection. and no, this isn't about becoming an asshole. it's about understanding that real relationships require something we're terrified of: authenticity.

the psychology behind people pleasing is wild. it usually starts in childhood when we learn that our worth is conditional. maybe your parents only showed affection when you achieved something. maybe you had to be the ""easy"" kid because your sibling was struggling. whatever the origin, your brain wired itself to believe love and acceptance must be earned through performance. dr. harriet braiker's work on the disease to please breaks this down brilliantly. she explains how people pleasers are essentially stuck in a pattern of self abandonment, constantly scanning for what others need while ignoring their own internal compass.

here's the thing though. when you give from a place of fear (fear of rejection, fear of conflict, fear of being alone), people can sense it. not consciously maybe, but there's an energetic transaction happening. you're essentially saying ""i don't think i'm enough as i am, so let me earn my place here."" and ironically that creates the exact dynamic you're trying to avoid. people lose respect. they take you for granted. the relationship becomes unbalanced.

mark manson talks about this in the subtle art of not giving a fck. the chapter on relationships absolutely wrecked me in the best way. he points out that healthy relationships require each person to be willing to both hurt the other and be hurt. not in a cruel way, but in the sense that you're willing to disappoint someone by being honest about your needs and boundaries. you're willing to risk the relationship for the sake of authenticity. people pleasers won't do this. they'd rather slowly suffocate than rock the boat.

**the difference between generous giving and transactional giving** is something i learned from brene brown's work. she distinguishes between what she calls ""clear is kind"" versus ""unclear is unkind."" when you're people pleasing, you're being unclear. you're pretending you don't have needs. you're saying yes when you mean no. you're hiding parts of yourself. and while it feels ""nice"" in the moment, it's actually unkind because you're building a relationship on false premises. then you resent people for not appreciating sacrifices they never asked you to make.

genuine generosity comes from overflow, not depletion. it's giving because you genuinely want to, with zero strings attached. no mental scorekeeping. no expectation of reciprocity. no hidden agenda of being liked or chosen. this kind of giving actually strengthens relationships because it's honest.

i found this app called paired that's been super helpful for practicing this in my relationship. it's designed for couples but the daily questions force you to articulate your actual feelings and needs, which is exactly what people pleasers suck at. five minutes a day of just being honest about ""here's what i actually want"" feels uncomfortably vulnerable at first but it builds that muscle.

there's also an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from psychology research, relationship experts, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized learning plans. if your goal is something like ""stop people pleasing in my relationship"" or ""set boundaries without guilt,"" it generates audio content tailored to that specific struggle. you can customize how deep you want to go, from a quick 15 minute overview to a 40 minute session with concrete examples and scripts. the content draws from verified sources in psychology and relationship science, which matters when you're trying to unlearn deeply ingrained patterns.

nedra glover tawwab's book set boundaries find peace is the most practical guide i've found for this work. she's a therapist who specializes in relationship patterns and boundary issues. the book walks through specific scripts for saying no, expressing needs, and handling pushback. because here's what nobody tells you about recovering from people pleasing: when you start setting boundaries, people who benefited from your lack of boundaries will NOT be happy. they'll call you selfish. they'll act hurt. they'll try to guilt you back into your old role. tawwab prepares you for this and gives you tools to stay grounded.

one exercise that shifted things for me was writing down every time i said yes when i wanted to say no for one week. holy shit. it was like 30+ instances. coffee with someone i find draining. extra project at work. plans i had zero interest in. each time i'd tell myself it was ""no big deal"" but they added up to me having basically no time or energy for things i actually cared about.

**understanding your attachment style** matters here too. if you lean anxious attachment, people pleasing is often your go to strategy for keeping people close. the book attached by amir levine breaks down how anxious types essentially abandon themselves to maintain proximity to others. you become hypervigilant to other people's moods and needs while completely disconnecting from your own. learning about this helped me see the pattern wasn't about being ""too nice"" but about deep fear of abandonment driving behavior.

esther perel has this great bit in her podcast where should we stay or should we go where she talks about how people pleasers are actually controlling. sounds harsh but she's right. by never stating your needs or showing your real self, you're trying to control how others perceive you and guarantee their approval. you're not actually being vulnerable or letting them choose the real you. you're performing a version you think they'll accept.

the path out isn't about becoming selfish or stopping generosity. it's about learning to give from choice rather than compulsion. it's about building enough internal worth that you don't need external validation to feel ok. it's about trusting that the people meant for you will stick around when you're authentic, and the ones who bail were never really yours to begin with.

**practice stating preferences in low stakes situations** first. ""actually i'd prefer thai food tonight"" instead of just going along. ""i need to leave by 9pm"" instead of staying until whenever. notice the discomfort that comes up. sit with it. realize that expressing a need doesn't make you difficult, it makes you human.

try the app finch for building self worth outside of relationships. it's a self care app that gamifies personal habits and emotional check ins. sounds silly but having something prompting you daily to pay attention to YOUR needs rather than everyone else's helps retrain your brain.

one mindset shift that helped: people actually respect you more when you have boundaries. the people who get mad when you set limits were using you, not relating to you. anyone who genuinely cares about you WANTS you to tell them the truth about what you need. they don't want a performing, exhausted version of you who's secretly keeping score.

here's the uncomfortable truth. some relationships will end when you stop people pleasing. and that's actually a good thing. those connections were built on an unsustainable foundation. letting them fall away creates space for relationships based on mutual respect and authentic care. the kind where you can both give and receive freely. where you don't have to earn your place. where you're chosen for who you actually are, not who you're pretending to be.

start small. pick one relationship where you can practice being more honest. notice when you're about to people please and pause. ask yourself what you actually want in this moment. you don't have to announce it, just notice the gap between your automatic response and your authentic one.

you're not responsible for managing everyone else's emotions. you're not required to shrink yourself so others feel comfortable. you don't owe anyone a performance. the relationships that matter will survive your honesty. the ones that don't were built on sand anyway.",1,1769826743.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

1qrpyzx,https://youtu.be/VLduXEepMDM,"DDD week, day 1: ""Soul Man"" by Sam & Dave, the way Donald ""Duck"" Dunn played it (most likely)","I've always been more into Stax than Motown. Motown hits were all over the place, but Stax had the real groove. The 1980 movie ""The Blues Brothers"" cemented this preference when I saw the coolest looking, pipe smoking bass player: Donald ""Duck"" Dunn. I wanted to be that guy. So two years ago, when I picked up the bass again, I naturally sought out some Stax grooves to play.

There are lots of tutorials and covers of Stax hits, but the problem I had with many of the interpretations was that I found the fingerings and movement rather awkward and I could never get the smooth playing style that Dunn is so famous for. So I started scouring Youtube for clips of Dunn playing live so I could copy his approach of playing. There is one Youtube channel that has a lot of awesome clips, namely [https://www.youtube.com/@bluesincolour](https://www.youtube.com/@bluesincolour) and clips of the concert that Booker T and the MGs gave in Oslo in 1967 are great way to see how Dunn actually played (and to enjoy his incredible bass-face. Check out the clip of 'Tic Tac Toe' and you'll know what I mean).

From looking at Dunn playing live I found a couple of things: he hangs his thumb over the neck, he is not afraid to use open strings, and he really like to shift - rather aggressively - two frets between notes. So with this I started to see if there were smoother ways to play Soul Man by Sam & Dave. The problem with most versions you find online is that the C is played on the E string, 8th fret, but Dunn rarely span four frets, he rather shifted his hand up or down. So with this knowledge I came up my own bass version of this tune. The original version has of course the well-known gaffe where Dunn forgets to transition into the first chorus, but by extracting the stems with AI I also discovered the passing note in the third chorus, which I haven't seen anywhere before.

Anyway, this interpretation plays very smoothly and so I wanted to share it here. The pdf is free to download from my Google Drive if you want it. Have fun, keep on grooving.

P.S. And yes, like Donald, I do smoke an occasional pipe, but not while playing.

Between the subway noise, the constant notifications, and the general hum of urban anxiety, my nervous system is often in ""fight or flight"" before I’ve even finished my first coffee.

I’ve found that when I’m that overstimulated, ""just focusing on my breath"" is actually really hard. My brain is moving too fast for my lungs.

That’s when I started practicing the **60-Second Tactile Reset.**

**The Core Idea: Tactile Grounding** Instead of trying to quiet my mind with more thoughts, I use a physical object to ""anchor"" my attention. For me, it’s a small desktop Zen garden or a high-texture palm stone.

**How it works in 60 seconds:**

1. **The Physical Shift:** I stop looking at the screen and put my hands on a physical texture (sand, wood, stone).
2. **The Sensory Dive:** I spend 30 seconds focusing exclusively on the resistance. If it's sand, I feel the ""drag"" of the rake. If it's stone, I feel the temperature and the weight.
3. **The Nervous System Override:** This tactile input acts as a manual override. By forcing the brain to process a complex physical sensation, it naturally pulls resources away from the ""anxiety loop"" in the prefrontal cortex.

**Why it’s different for urban stress:** In a city, our senses are constantly being ""attacked"" by digital and artificial inputs. A 60-second tactile reset with a natural material (sand, stone, wood) provides a momentary ""return to nature"" that resets the baseline of my stress.

It’s not a cure-all, but it’s the difference between ending the day with a massive tension headache and ending it with a bit of mental ""Ma"" (space).

**I’m curious—do you have a ""micro-reset"" for high-stress moments?**

Hi!

(You can be my age or older, and I'm most comfortable talking to women :( )

I would like to find someone with whom I can chat from time to time. I have days when I am very busy, so I may not communicate with people for some time (days or even week or two). I hope to find someone who doesn't have a problem with this.

I started cross-stitching, and I love watching all kinds of movies, TV series, and animated series. I work in a pottery workshop (I teach people how to paint ceramics). Sometimes I play games (rn only gacha games in my heart), I like to laugh and make jokes. And also sometimes I have a mood for deep conversations. And sometimes I'm yupping about my favorite character in the show or about really good coffee at a coffee shop. I'm very random, I admit it. Overall, I'm pretty ordinary. 

I like to listen to other people's opinions, interests, hobbies, and learn something new. I really like calm, rational and mature people (who is responsible for their emotions)! (And don't be homophobic!!!!).

Let's send each other random photos about our lives, chat about our hobbies and discuss everything in the world? Let's complain to each other about work or tell how the morning went? We can talk about plans or be busy, but know that we have each other!

Modern day women really messed up something traditional and want to wonder and question why guys don't take women on dates anymore. Back in the day women who allowed a man to take them on a date were actually interested in him and it showed during the date. Another thing is they weren't picky about where to go for the date. Rather a guy chose a place expensive or cheap, it wasn't about how rich or broke he look, at least he was trying to get to know her. Lastly about back in the day, they didn't waste men time. If they weren't interested from the start they would have declined. Now we move forward to modern day women and they are the complete opposite. Nowadays it's all about how much a man spends and how fancy/expensive the place he takes her to. Back in the day you can take a woman on a coffee date and she'll be grateful but nowadays try it and get laughed at and called broke. Modern day women also don't appreciate the date as they don't even pay the man any attention, just buried in their phones not caring. What's crazy is how modern day women would invite their friends and expect you to pay for all of them. Lastly they waste men time and money. She knew she wasn't interested in him but didn't tell him cause free meal. It's all about getting what she want's first them truth comes after. I heard stories of how guys would take a woman out on a date just for him to find out she wasn't interested in him. I also learned how some women would still accept a date even if they aren't single. With all these crazy things, it's understandable why guys don't take women on dates anymore, they are tired of wasting their time.

(You can be my age or older, and I'm most comfortable talking to women (!!! Girlies!!!) )

I would like to find someone with whom I can chat from time to time. I have days when I am very busy, so I may not communicate with people for some time (days or even week or two). I hope to find someone who doesn't have a problem with this.

I started cross-stitching, and I love watching all kinds of movies, TV series, and animated series. I work in a pottery workshop (I teach people how to paint ceramics). Sometimes I play games (rn only gacha games in my heart), I like to laugh and make jokes. And also sometimes I have a mood for deep conversations. And sometimes I'm yupping about my favorite character in the show or about really good coffee at a coffee shop. I'm very random, I admit it. Overall, I'm pretty ordinary. 

I like to listen to other people's opinions, interests, hobbies, and learn something new. I really like calm, rational and mature people (who is responsible for their emotions)! (And don't be homophobic!!!!).

Let's send each other random photos about our lives, chat about our hobbies and discuss everything in the world? Let's complain to each other about work or tell how the morning went? We can talk about plans or be busy, but know that we have each other!

How to Read a 10-K Annual Report and Suss Out a Stock in 10 Minutes

By  Al Root

March 09, 2019 8:00 am EST

There are stories—probably apocryphal—that Warren Buffett reads one annual report each day. That’s a wise idea. There is a lot of useful information contained in annual reports, but one a day may be ambitious for the everyday investor.

Still, Barron’s suspects that not enough investors regularly read annual reports, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a form called the 10-K. Perhaps it’s because investors think the reports are too daunting, or too boring.

General Electric’s (ticker: GE) annual report is 317 pages, American International Group’s (AIG) recent 10-K filing is 405 pages long. But getting through the reports isn’t as hard as you might think. Here’s how to read an annual report in 10 minutes or less.

**Get Some Coffee**

For this exercise, we selected one of Barron’s recent stock picks — Teradyne (TER). Its annual report was filed on March 1 and is a mere 154 pages.

Why did we pick Teradyne? It isn’t the most complicated company in the world. It has a few different divisions, but it makes stuff—physical things it sells to other people. Companies that sell financial products or have many disparate divisions are a lesson for another day.

Teradyne is also a technology company and its products aren’t for consumers. It sells to companies that sell to other companies that finally sell to companies that make consumer goods. Companies like Teradyne that are technology-laden and deep in the supply chain can appear difficult to understand. That doesn’t have to be the case.

All 10-K filings are laid out in a similar way. The sections are set by the SEC. There is a business description, risk factors, mine-safety disclosures (Yes, mine safety disclosures are required for everyone.) and, eventually, financial statements. We will start with the business description.

**Start the Timer**

Teradyne’s business description is about 700 words, and it tells us that the company makes semiconductor-testing equipment. It sells that equipment to large semiconductor companies and got into the robotics business recently through two acquisitions.

That’s enough to know. We’re off to a quick start.

The business description can offer bonus tidbits, but you just have to scan it. It’s helpful to search—assuming you are reading the document digitally—for “competitor” or “competition.” Searching for terms is a good way to save time and we only have 10 minutes.

Teradyne does an excellent job listing its competitors. In less than a minute, we learn the names of many companies that can affect Teradyne’s performance. The company, for instance, competes with Japanese equipment maker Advantest (6857.Japan), as well as Keysight (KEYS). Checking on these two, we learn that Keysight is much larger than Teradyne. In the robotics business, Teradyne has a different set of competitors, again much larger, including the Japanese firm Fanuc (6954.Japan) and ABB (ABB), the Swiss conglomerate.

Now it’s time to move on to the risk section and read the headlines. Before you sell everything, please realize that all companies list many risk factors. They need to cover their legal bases. Teradyne lists 27 or so risks. Some are generic, but quickly scanning this section we learn about tariffs—a topic in the news these days—and intellectual property, which usually matters to tech firms.

**Grab the calculator**

Now it’s time for the financial statements. That means we have skipped 20-plus pages, including the mine disclosures. Is that a good idea? It’s not ideal, but the goal is to extract the most value in 10 minutes, so we dive into the numbers next.

First up is the balance sheet, a snapshot of all the stuff Teradyne owns, expressed in language only an accountant could love. Companies usually provide two years of data. Note the total assets, in this case, $2.7 billion. Then look for cash and debt. Teradyne has about $900 million in cash and $400 million in debt. More cash than debt is a good thing. We can conclude that Teradyne’s balance sheet is in good shape.

Next comes the income statement. It’s good to power on the calculator at this point—or open a number-crunching app. Aggressive mathematicians can eyeball the figures.

In the income statement, we quickly check on growth, margins, and earnings. At Teradyne, sales have gone from $1.7 billion in 2016 to $2.1 billion in 2018. That’s about 25% growth, but it includes acquisitions. The business was flat from 2017 to 2018.

Gross profit in the last two years was $1.2 billion, which means gross margins were stable for two years. The company lost money in 2016, but they had $330 million in goodwill impairments. That’s not great, but you can exclude it when looking at average earnings. Teradyne earned about $450 million in 2018 and $330 million on average each year for the past three years (excluding the write-off).

Teradyne’s equity-market value is $6.8 billion, so a glance at the calculator shows us the company is trading for about 15 times 2018 earnings and about 20 times average earnings. Usually, Wall Street values companies relative to their forward earnings, but tomorrow’s profitability is linked to the past.

The last of the financial statement in our quick process is the cash-flow statement. Retained earnings is for another day.

Here, we do with cash from operations what we did with earnings. The company generated $480 million in cash from operations in 2018 and about $522 million on average each year for the past three years.

Just one line below cash from operations is capital spending: outlays to replenish the gear and facilities Teradyne needs to make the stuff it sells. That’s about $100 million a year on average. If we take capital spending away from cash from operations, we learn that Teradyne generates about $420 million in free cash flow each year.

That’s the money Teradyne can use to pay dividends, pay down debt, buy companies, or buy back its own stock.

The $420 million of free cash gives Teradyne has a free-cash-flow yield of 6%. That’s free cash flow divided by the company’s equity-market value. At 6%, Teradyne’s yield is about 1 percentage point better than for the S&P 500.

There are still 90 second left. Ample time to read the notes to the financial statements. We treat these like the risk section. Read the headlines and stop if something strikes your fancy.

I like to look at the retirement plans. The company’s pension-plan promises amount to $178 million—2.6% of Teradyne’s market value. Not a big deal, and Teradyne has $144 million set aside to pay the obligations.

The most important note is often the business-segment detail. Here we learn that Teradyne’s semiconductor-test business is its largest segment and that sales in that operation shrank in 2018. Industrial automation, on the other hand, is small but growing rapidly. What’s more, margins in the robots division are small, at about 3%. That’s something to watch: Ideally, as the automation business grows, higher margins will follow.

(Looking for divisions that are losing money is a good way to find hidden value that can generate investment returns in the future.)

That’s it. We are done.

**Exhale Slowly.**

What did we learn? Teradyne is a smaller tech supplier with a good balance sheet and stable margins, trading at a slight discount to the S&P 500 based on both its price/earnings ratio and free cash flow. The robot business is growing quickly and has just become profitable. Also, tariffs are a concern and the business is cyclical.

With all this, you could write a Wall Street research report.

You can spend as much time as you want poring over filings. Barron’s thinks any amount of time spent learning about a company is a good idea. The knowledge picked up doesn’t fade. It compounds.

*Jan 1 — 2026*.

I begin this exercise by making this first entry in my diary on this day—my first on this expedition—per the recommendation of my psychiatrist. Her rationale in recommending this was a belief that such an exercise would help me express my thoughts in an organized way, and as a way of relieving stress without relapsing into the consumption of pornography. This is why I have not brought my phone with me on this voyage, too; I fear I lack the self-control necessary to avoid slipping into any old compulsions. 

I have also chosen to write this in English rather than Japanese. Some thoughts, however, resist translation and shall be rendered as such.

I will maintain and update this journal as regularly as I can; however, I have given myself the arbitrary goal of at least keeping it—barring grave injury or oceanic curse—until the end of this expedition. In the event of my untimely demise, I do wish for this diary to be destroyed by fire; furthermore, I entrust this task to *you*, dear reader—and I must ask you this favor only for the sake of my privacy.
 
I have never been a sociable person. When I received word from my supervisor that I had been selected to participate in the Minamitorishima expedition—the prospect of spending a month at sea, in my solitude, was magnetic. I shared the news with my mother, then my psychiatrist, each of whom proved supportive of the endeavor I was to embark on. Though I am not ashamed to admit that I wished I had more people to bid my goodbyes to—a friend, a romantic partner, anyone besides my mother, whom I love dearly, and my psychiatrist, whom I pay on a biweekly basis. 

It is a strange contradiction. I crave solitude in the morning mist and yet desire companionship in the moonlit hours? I imagine there must be others who dwell within this **迎拒の地**—driving away all intruders so carelessly trespassing upon our personal space, with a “welcome” sign hung at the low mountain gates.

Or perhaps this is merely a gentler fiction—something to distract me from my own anxiety, a quiet trick played between the conscious and the subconscious; an attempt to collectivize what may, in truth, be nothing more than a personal shortcoming. A coping mechanism, if you will.

With me, I have brought myself two books—*Spinal Catastrophism*, an esoteric work of neural philosophy by Thomas Moynihan, that I would prefer to read but, failing that, also—*Moby Dick*, a much more digestible (and topical) work, that I believe requires no introduction. And my late grandfather’s vintage _Kaichū-dokei_ pocket watch. I keep it with me as a private abstraction of a **くにつかみ**. I am aware of the contradiction. Still, it will soon be separated from land as I am—by miles of abyssal water. I allow myself this one inconsistency

The day itself—besides the initial excitement—proved dull. I found myself gazing at the shore for a minute—then, nevermore. I had my sight set on the horizon, instead, yet further *excitement* was a valued commodity. My psychiatrist spoke of ""dopamine overdosing"" at a prior session—a mind becoming so dependent on external stimuli that simpler joys and thrills no longer make a dent. I think this trip may ""reset"" my brain, too, or at least my psychiatrist seems to believe so. A ""dopamine detox"". I guess this is what withdrawal feels like.

I believe I will be able to write more about my *actual* work in the next entry. I anticipate the coming days will test my skills—and my constitution—more fully and with a bit more purpose. 

Tonight, I believe I shall watch the sea, then get some rest. 

*Jan 2 — 2026*.

This day—the second of our expedition—went by quicker than I had anticipated. 

I spent about half of the day working. I am unable to describe said work in fine detail, given the nature of it, but it was overall a pleasant experience. Since I deal with data and scientific instruments of both *precise* and *expensive* proportions, my work keeps me glued to a console screen below deck with the rest of the scientific staff—though I am allowed the occasional visit up top when I am called for.

I made acquaintances with some of my peers and introduced myself to the rest of the supervisory team at the end of my shift. I believe that went *fine*. Then, I took some coffee and went above deck to watch the seas with some members of my team. 

The sun was a welcome relief from the coldness below deck and I immediately found myself in happier spirits. Strangely, I did not feel the absence of my phone—or any similar stimuli—as much as I had been expecting to. Perhaps the ""detox"" is working already; naturally, I find myself to be skeptical of it, especially so soon. But I did not wish to waste this moment of clarity either so I gave my cynicism a welcome rest and let my mind relax.

I did not get a chance to read either of my books when I returned to my cabin. I hope I will be able to get started with Moynihan tomorrow. I do hate not making progress.

*Jan 3 — 2026*.

Spent much of my time working. Not much to write. I did get started with Moynihan's *Spinal Catastrophism*, however.

It is a strange book to say the least.

*Jan 6 — 2026*.

I was not able to write for the past two days. The reasons for this are twofold.

First, we arrived at Minamitorishima in the twilight hours of my last entry day. Since then, I have had no time to peruse any of Moynihan's writing or transcribe any of my own in this journal. *Work* had me running up and down stairs, in and out of corridors, working with my own research and overseeing its application above deck. This went on unceasingly until today when we stopped to coordinate and assess the results that we had so far. Needless to say, it has all been very exhausting.

Secondly and this is quite crucial, there was simply not much to transcribe even if it were possible to do so. Between looking at computer screens and gazing at the empty bottoms of coffee cups, all there was to think about was *work* and I cannot dedicate this diary to the intricate details of my *work*.

However, on a more positive note, it also kept me distracted from my urges and, more importantly, **迎拒の地**. I will count that as a victory. 

I fear these entries will not be as regular as I had anticipated when I began this exercise, given the state of things, though I will try my best to attend to it as often as I can, still. 

*Jan 11 — 2026*.

Whale pod sighting at 9:40 a.m. 

We were given a break—a short one—to go above deck and watch. I must admit, dear reader, that it injected some much needed joy in the spirits of all those working on this ship. 

I think they may have been compelled into migrating by the main drill. We try to be mindful of sea creatures when we use it but animals are far more delicate—and perceptive—than we give them credit for, especially whales which are among the most intelligent beings on this planet. I imagine news of our ship and our equipment had already traveled far along their communication routes long before our arrival at Minamitorishima, and would continue to travel further, carried in part by the same pod we had watched so gleefully.

We gave our most intrusive equipment a rest and transitioned to ""soft"" research for the next hour till we could be assured that the area had been, finally, evacuated by the marine life present beneath our ship. 

Then, we got back to work.

*Jan 15 — 2026*.

I made a new friend. 

Eitarō belongs to another section of the research team. His work primarily involves the refinement of the data we collect, so it can be delivered to our on-land counterparts for further processing and research. In his spare time, he mostly just sleeps and when he's awake, he prefers the closedness of the rooms below deck to the sprawling blue horizon of the Pacific.

I found that he makes for good conversation once he is out of his shell. I feel that we are alike in that way. And while I don't share his love for manga, I do appreciate his interest in literature and history—especially the fantastical sort.

I have been spending my breaks conversing with him below deck these past few days rather than top side as I feel he could use the company. I could, too.

*Jan 16 — 2026*.

I lent Eitarō my copy of *Moby Dick* while I spent some time digesting more of *Spinal Catastrophism*.

For him, I feel that the inherent themes of adventure and voyage in *Dick* might help him overcome some of his distaste for the open seas, so that we may perhaps start taking some of our breaks above deck in the warm sun. 

Minamitorishima is an anomaly in that regard. It is, by far, the hottest part of Japan with temperatures ranging from extremely hot to warm throughout the year with no real discernible winter season. Even now in January, the minimum temperate only drops to a balmy eighteen degrees while the maximum touches the lower end of thirty. 

I find myself still struggling to truly describe what I'm reading when it comes to Moynihan and his *Catastrophism*. I do feel like I understand it—partially, at least—although any attempts at a thesis have proven futile. I will spend some more time making sense of it all before my next attempt.

*Jan 21 — 2026*.

I have not seen Eitarō since my last entry.

The day after, I found out from our colleagues that he had taken a medical leave of absence that day and was confined to his quarters. I asked for the nurse onboard to deliver him my sympathies and returned to work.

The next day, I found him missing again. Another day of medical leave. They assured me it was nothing serious, that it was common for personnel on expeditions such as this to suffer from prolonged seasickness and that I need not worry myself over his health. My breaks, like the day before, proved lonesome once more.

When I did not find him at his station on the 19th, I decided to visit his quarters personally. It was a dim, quiet place—familiar, in a way—and mostly undecorated. Eitarō welcomed my presence with a bleak smile and a gentle bow. He assured me, in his own words, that he was *fine* and would recover soon, and returned me my copy of *Moby Dick* with the same warm gratitude that I had come to expect from him. 

He told me he had read it all, and that he truly liked the story. We spent some time discussing the book at length but, with my break already running late, I asked him if he would like to discuss it further during our next break. He told me that he had been prescribed more rest for the next two days but that, if I could wait till he had recovered his strength, we could perhaps go above deck and watch the waves. I happily agreed. 

That day—which shall be our final day at Minamitorishima—is tomorrow.

*Jan 22 — 2026.*

In the early hours of the morning, we left Minamitorishima behind for good and ventured once more into the open seas. 

During Eitarō's two remaining days of rest, I had the chance of reading some more of Moynihan's *Spinal Catastrophism*. I have transcribed a short quote from this book—full of longer, much denser quotes—below.

_“It is the duty of a spine to destroy the universe; or, a spine is the universe’s method of acknowledging this duty to self-destruct._”

Despite my still rudimentary understanding of this work—and general skepticism towards what it is trying to say—I will try my best to parse this one, short quote, since I believe after the events of today, I will be spending some time reevaluating my understanding of the universe and our place therein.

In the context of the book—as part of Moynihan's grand constructed theory—the spine is the critical center of consciousness. It is the universe's *implant* in an animal body, carrying within it *code* that defines not only a person's consciousness, but also his future and his past, the secrets of shared extraterrestrial ancestors, one's relationship with oneself, and the living heartbeat of the universe itself. The same *code*—inscribed into the spine by the universe—directs the person to seek out answers and then, once sufficiently informed, seek to *become* the universe—via mutual annihilation. 

Eitarō was in good spirits when we arrived above deck. He looked fresher, *healthier* and I was glad to see my friend with this renewed vigor. We had chosen to spend the break below deck, earlier, and discussed our lives back home—choosing instead to go above deck at the end of our shifts, with the evening sun setting gently over the horizon. And that is what we had done.

It was a beautiful sight and both my friend and I agreed that the view looked to be something out of a fairytale. The red sun dipped ever slowly beneath the blue, darkening waves, the crimson sky punctured with silhouettes of clouds and sea birds gliding across the horizon. I felt the touch of his fingertips upon mine and clasped his hand shut in my palm. The calm serenity of that moment—me, him, the endless horizon—exceeded any amount of joy and excitement that I could have anticipated to experience in a million giga-annum. 

In that moment, I could never have anticipated the destructive potential of the emotional turmoil that followed after. 

I felt Eitarō's hand slip out of mine, his gaze still affixed to the horizon. He was looking at something. I was, too, though I do not believe I saw whatever it was that he was begging me to see. He pointed at the horizon, his face pale from sheer terror, with the same hand that had only just been clasped in mine. He repeated himself, over and over again, and when I say, dear reader, I tried desperately to see what he wanted me to see, I truly—with all the sincerity in my heart—mean it.

*Umibōzu*.

His face was stretched long and pale. 

*Umibōzu*.

He kept repeating himself, his fingers growing cold like winter snow, then hot like the fresh kindling of a snuffed fire.

*Umibōzu*, he repeated himself and I still saw nothing. 

We tried to calm him down, assure him that there was nothing out there but his terror pierced through any rational thought I could have had at that moment. I wiped at his wet cheeks and held him close, though it was no use. I held his hand and reminded him of our little breaks, the good time we had spent together on this ship, yet it did nothing to assuage his pain. 

Soon, the nurses were upon us. They tore him away from the group and escorted him below deck— the one place that he had felt to be truly safe for him.

I should never have invited him above deck. I should have never lent him that book. I can never forget the look on his face, the helpless dark eyes staring into mine. I wish I could have done more. I wish I could go back and change everything—but I cannot.

I can only destroy the universe or myself.

*Jan 31 — 2026.*

Eitarō has been in the medical ward since the incident. They say he's stable and calm. They told me he asked for books to read. 

I did not give them *Moby Dick*.

Instead, I gave it a read myself. Or rather—the little notes and inscriptions Eitarō had left within.

Every passage, every sentence had been given a new meaning. I could feel my friend's warmth through the words he had written in the book I had lent him. It was him, inscribed into the book's spine—like the universe's imprint on our own, giving us meaning—and I could feel his heartbeat within my own. A new **くにつかみ** — created before my eyes. So *warm*, so *alive*.

This day is the last of our expedition. When midnight comes, the *Chikyū* shall reverse its course and embark on another journey to bring us home to Tokyo. 

I hope Eitarō can get the treatment he needs back home. And I hope that I can see him once again, to rekindle the brief friendship we shared on this ship. There is much we still need to talk about. 

*February 1 — 2026. Eulogy for Eitarō*.

On this day, we lost Watanabe Eitarō. He was twenty-six years old.

They told me my friend—Eitarō—had gone missing. We looked everywhere. I looked within every room below deck, every nook, every corner of every corridor and hallway. I searched your quarters, hoping he would excuse the intrusion when we found him, safe and sound, tucked away somewhere on the ship. A bit scared, maybe, but *safe*.

It took forty three minutes till we heard the announcement. *Man overboard*.

It took us another six minutes to rescue him from the cold, unforgiving waves. 

His face was as pale as it had been on that remorseful day, his eyes sunken, his lips curled into a smile that almost conveyed relief. Emergency aid was no use but we tried anyway. We believed in no gods but we prayed anyway. 

My friend Eitarō. How frightened you must have been, facing that cold dark sea on your own.

They're calling it suicide. How could that be true?

Did you really come above deck? Did you look into the waves and resign yourself to that fate? Did you feel it calling it to you, the way it does to me every day? 

Did you see *Umibōzu* again?

If there truly is life after death, I hope you are at peace now. If we truly do join the universe once we stop existing on this earth, I hope you appear in the sky as a true supernova, shining above all. I will be looking up every day, praying for a glimpse of your visage.

You were my friend, you were my light. And I loved you.

And may I see you again, some day.",1,1769825495.0,artpoasting,0,1.0,False

1qrpheu,https://www.reddit.com/r/revengestories/comments/1qrpheu/my_ex_blocked_me_so_i_humiliated_him_on_venmo/,"My ex blocked me, so I humiliated him on Venmo","This was a while ago but I thought this subreddit might enjoy hearing about it. A few months ago, my ex (26 m) and I (26 f) got together to catch up over some coffee. We had dated for about 6 months and it had been about 6 months since we broke up. We broke up amicably (on my birthday but whatever) due to incompatibilities that were irreconcilable. Mostly that he needed tons of space and I needed more attention than he could give. We both privately expected our coffee catchup to go terribly but for whatever reason, we both showed up anyway. Strangely enough, when we started talking, sparks were flying like crazy. We both felt it and after a couple hours of talking, my ex brought up the possibility of becoming friends with benefits since we were both attracted to each other and not dating much, but knew that we would not work out as a “real” couple. I took some time to think about it, but I agreed that it could be fun to try. We took a couple weeks to hang out and talk about boundaries and what we do and don’t want out of this new dynamic. My chief concern was that we would sleep together and he would immediately decide it wasn’t worth it. I’ve had that happen many times before and it just makes me feel crummy and like all these people want from me is sex. If all you want is sex, find someone else. If you like our friendship but also happen to feel attracted to me, then that works for me. I cannot stress enough how many times I told him that. That was my biggest fear and to not just have sex with me and then leave. He seemed to get it. 

Fast forward a couple weeks and we have sex. It was pretty fun. I put myself out there maybe more than I had in our relationship. I don’t know why, but I just got really vulnerable to try to make it a really good time for both of us. After the sex, we both rinsed off and got dressed. We were planning on hanging out for a couple hours afterward. He had only been at my place for about an hour total. To my unpleasant surprise, he told me he had suddenly remembered he forgot to feed his cat breakfast and that he needed to leave right away to do that. I stood my ground a bit and told him we needed to hang out for at least like an hour or so, so I don’t feel used, you know, like all the conversations we had had before? We even talked about it right before we had sex that day. He agreed to go get some matcha with me and chat for about 45 minutes but he was clearly uncomfortable the whole time and eager to leave.

The next morning, I received a text from him that he needed to end our friends with benefits relationship and that we shouldn’t see each other anymore. He had changed his mind. This upset me a lot, but it was Not the reason I enacted my petty revenge. 

I was continuing to process what had happened the next week when my ex texted me to see how I was doing. I asked him if we could get together and talk about the whole situation because it had been confusing for me. I told him that I didn’t think it was his intention, but that he had basically done EXactly what I asked him not to do and enacted my biggest fear about the situation since I have a history of that sort of thing happening. He didn’t respond for an hour, then 2, then 4, then 1 day, then 2. It wasn’t unlike him to ghost for a few hours or a day at a time, but 2 days? I thought maybe he was traveling and I didn’t know, or worse! I actually started to worry that something awful had happened to him because I knew he would never ghost me in such a vulnerable state - we had dated for 6 months and I thought I knew him better than that. So, I checked his Instagram. I was blocked. I started to panic and texted him to ask what was going on. I realized if he had blocked me on Instagram, he must have blocked me on text too. I now had no way of getting in contact with him. He had made the situation so much worse! This was no longer perceived abandonment, but true abandonment that I now had to reconcile with. I felt betrayed. He had hurt me in a way that I begged him not to, and that he knew was a serious wound for me. He was a monster! So I started racking my brain for how to get revenge. One thing about me is that I used to lie down and take stuff like this, now I do not. If you hurt me, I hurt you. You don’t get to live on without pain when you’ve caused me pain. So… I spent like 2 straight days figuring out his new address (where he lived with his parents) and tracking down the social media of every family member and friend of his that I could find. My thought was that maybe I could send him something humiliating in the mail for his parents to find, or maybe I could out him as the asshole that he is to his family or friends. None of it was quite right. It didn’t feel right to involve other people like that - it could really freak them out and I just didn’t want to do that. On the third day it hit me: There was No Chance he had remembered to block me on Venmo. I wanted to give him some mild trust issues because he didn’t seem to care or relate to mine. I wanted it to be something that would shock and embarrass him. So I drafted my request and hit send. He texted me about 30 minutes later apologizing and I told him to f\\\*ck off. This subreddit doesn’t allow pictures so I’ll quote myself here:

* I now feel brain fog very rarely, my days mostly feel calm and intentional.
* I am late/miss an appointment, once a month instead of 3 times a day.
* My house is clutter-free and easy to keep that way.
* I get out of bed without hesitation 4 days out of 7 in a week.
* I procrastinate on tasks less
* I am still working on interrupting people in meetings and conversations
* I go to bed at the same time 5 days out of 7
* I used to drive around with no memory what route I took to get there. Hasn't happened in 8 months.
* When something exciting/stressful happens, and I get aroused/dysregulated, I feel like I know what I need to do next to manage my emotions and body sensations.

Bio:

* Age: 30-35YO
* Gender: Cis-Woman

What works:

* Mindset
   * Shifting from being a people-pleaser to treating myself like I’m worth the amount of fuss and care I would offer to someone I love
   * After waking up, asking “how did you sleep” and answering yourself
* Built my care team
   * Monthly occupational therapist appointments, these honestly feel like executive function coaching calls
   * Psychotherapy every 3 weeks, where we work on building the foundations for self-worth
   * Massage therapy every two months
* Medicine & food
   * 20mg Vyvanse every morning after I drink some soup
   * No more caffeine or alcohol
   * Sometimes black coffee after the medication wears off, to fall asleep
   * Prepared savoury breakfast
      * I microwave a small bowl of soup, then eat pieces of steak, grilled chicken, or pork chop
      * Tips from NutritionByKylie work for me
* Focused work
   * Pomodoro breaks are more important than the focus time
      * Using the ‘Focus Friend’ app
      * Doing something analog like the dishes and scanning my body for sensations. Mindfulness genuinely works
* House organization
   * Decluttering - I paid for the Clutter-bug bootcamp course, I find her ADHD specific motivations so relatable. You don’t need the course to use the zoning method for stuff in your house; it’s so good at catching me on bad days
   * Having a bag launch-drawer; the drawer is a command centre for any supply I might need for a day - keys, tissues, wallets, etc
* Task management
   * I deleted Asana, notion, etc. just on Google calendar+tasks now, decluttering digital information
   * I now log my days into a journal- I write the date out, weather, my daily prompt from Chani
   * I write out my 2 priorities for the day, one for work, one for my/my household. all my meetings and appointments
   * Write down ideas of tasks to triage and schedule to do twice a day. I followed JeffSu on youtube for this
* Personal budget:
   * I track my personal budget on YNAB, and check the app everyday to categorize my spending

Overall, finding ways to become aware of how your body feels, whether that is meditation for you, prayer, journalling, habit trackers has genuinely had the biggest impact. Doing this will make drinking water and eating regularly follow, because the first step is the noticing. A noisy mind can’t notice, is my biggest learning from this whole experience.

Same kitchen. Same morning. I poured hot water over the grounds, watched the steam curl up like it always did, and reached for the fridge.

My hand closed around the handle. I pulled.

Nothing.

Not resistance. Not a stuck seal. My arm moved, the motion happened, but the door didn’t respond. No visual confirmation. Like a screen frozen mid-frame.

Then it caught up.

The fridge door swung open all at once. Milk carton. Light humming. Perfectly normal, like it had never skipped a beat.

I stood there longer than I meant to. Told myself it was sleep deprivation. Or caffeine withdrawal. Or whatever excuse people use when something small feels wrong but not dangerous yet.

I poured the coffee. Drank it anyway.

The bathroom was next.

I brushed my teeth on autopilot, staring at myself without really seeing anything. Foam. Sink. The usual. I leaned forward, spat, reached for the towel...

...and stopped.

In the mirror, I was still spitting.

Not a reflection trick. Not a blur. Just… behind. My towel hovered in midair while the version of me in the glass finished what it was doing. Slow. Careful. Like it didn’t want to rush now that I was paying attention.

Two seconds passed. Maybe less.

Then the reflection straightened and met my eyes.

It looked afraid. Not confused. Afraid. Like it knew it wasn’t supposed to get caught.

I stepped back. The mirror stepped back with me, perfectly in sync again, like it had learned its lesson.

I didn’t finish brushing.

In the hallway, my hands shook as I pulled out my phone. I typed fast, no punctuation, straight into the group chat.

Something’s wrong with the mirrors.

The typing indicator appeared immediately.

We know.

Same profile picture. Same name.

My number.

I checked the timestamp. The reply was dated tomorrow.

I’m in my car now.

I didn’t pack anything. I just grabbed my keys and left. I’ve been driving for an hour, maybe more, but the streets don’t change. Latency Lane keeps coming back around. Same parked car. Same crooked mailbox. I’ve passed it four times without turning.

Every time I glance at the rearview mirror, I feel it before I see it.

It’s staring straight through the glass.
