1mw4uv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GardeningUK/comments/1mw4uv1/coffee_grounds_and_tea_leaves_spread_or_compost/,Coffee Grounds and Tea Leaves - spread or compost? (and cold black tea?),"Hi all,

As an avid tea and coffee drinker who has recently taken on a somewhat larger garden than I am used to I was wondering what makes most sense regarding my coffee grounds and tea leaves. Should I compost them (I have a compost bin which is doing a lovely job as far as I can tell) or should I put them directly onto my raised beds/borders?

I use an Aeropress for my coffee so there is a small thin paper filter with the coffee grounds - which would obviously be fine being composted, but not sure how it would be in the beds. Happy to separate if I need to but if I don't thats even better.

I also have some tea that goes cold in my pot which I currently pour onto my beds - I spread it around so its not one area which gets it. Assume this won't do any harm as long as it isn't gallons of the stuff?

1mw4u3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1mw4u3z/my_positive_colposcopy_experience/,My Positive Colposcopy Experience,"Hi everyone. I’m on my phone sitting at the doctors office so apologize for formatting! 
I wanted to share my colposcopy experience this morning as I’ve read so many horror stories and I went into the office thinking I was going to be down for the count and in worse pain than when I got my IUD placed five months ago. 

So I got my PAP a couple months ago at my six week IUD check up. I’ve had a history of normal PAPs and have never been tested/tested positive for HPV. Well I tested positive. Not for 16/18/45 but another high risk strain. The doctor recommended a Colposcopy with a possible biopsy since my PAP results were ASCUS. 

I went in, did a urine test, and the nurse took my vitals and made sure to make me feel at ease! The doctor came in and explained what was going to happen. She first inserted a speculum with a light on it, then used the acedic solution on a pap smear sized cotton swab on my cervix. She then used the colposcope(?) and noticed three spots where the cells turned white, but noted they looked low abnormal. She told me she would like to proceed with the biopsy because seeing any change at all and not taking one would make her feel like she isn’t doing what is necessary, and I agreed. 

I didn’t look at the tools she was using as I was by myself and didn’t want to freak myself out, but I caught a glimpse of it. It looked like a big hole punch. That immediately freaked me out but I stayed calm.  The first two samples were not bad at all. I barely felt the first one and the second two were near “12 o’clock” in terms of my cervix. The last hurt a bit, but it was less painful than getting my IUD placed! She then did the “aggressive PAP smear” and it looked kind of like a big spoolie. It was uncomfortable, but again not painful. Then she put something on my cervix to help the bleeding, told me when I would receive results, handed me a diaper of a pad and explained that because of the clotting solution I may see coffee ground like discharge. 

I am now waiting to get a vaccine! I feel pretty okay, just a little warm down there. I feel uncomfortable but I think it’s simply because I know what just happened and I tend to overthink. 

I just wanted to share my experience because for the past two weeks I have been freaking out reading horrible stories on reddit of people passing out and pain being 10/10. I am not shaming or discrediting these women at all because I know everyone reacts differently and has different pain tolerances. I personally have NO pain tolerance and was horrified for this experience but overall it was not bad. Would I do it again if I didn’t have to? Probably not, but hopefully this positive experience helps some of you! 

The doctor told me to squeeze and wiggle my toes while taking the biopsies and I honestly think the movement helped distract me. 

Good luck to anyone who may be getting one!!",2,1755763368.0,TwoXChromosomes,2,1.0,False
1mw4tfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/onionheadlines/comments/1mw4tfs/starbucks_coffee_now_officially_90_dirt_company/,"Starbucks Coffee Now Officially 90% Dirt, Company Says Customers “Won’t Notice”","SEATTLE—In a bold cost-cutting move, Starbucks announced today that its signature beverages will now be made with 90% high-quality, ethically sourced dirt, a sharp increase from the traditional 25% dirt that has long given the brand its “earthy” character.

“Rising coffee prices have forced us to innovate,” said Starbucks Vice President of Customer Taste Experience, Linda Mulch, while unveiling a new promotional slogan: ‘Ground to Perfection.’ “Frankly, most of our drinks already have so much caramel, whipped cream, and syrup in them that we could brew them with potting soil from Home Depot and no one would know the difference.”

The new formula, dubbed Terra Roast™, is already being rolled out nationwide. Early customer reactions have been mixed.

“I ordered a Pumpkin Spice Latte and yeah, it tasted a little grittier than usual,” said loyal customer Jessica Hernandez of Portland. “But honestly, it’s October, and I’ll drink literally anything with pumpkin spice in it, even if it’s just a fistful of dirt in hot milk.”

Health experts have raised concerns that replacing coffee with soil may cause long-term issues. “We really don’t recommend people consuming several cups of topsoil per day,” said Dr. Harold Kent of the FDA. “Unless you’re a worm. In which case, congrats, you’ve found your Mecca.”

Starbucks defended the change by pointing to its Artisanal Soil Blend, which combines sustainably harvested dirt from the Pacific Northwest with premium mulch from exclusive partners. “We’re not just shoveling in any dirt,” Mulch clarified. “This is handcrafted, small-batch, locally foraged dirt. The kind of dirt your grandparents would’ve wanted you to drink.”

Meanwhile, Starbucks investors are enthusiastic about the move. Company projections show that replacing beans with dirt could save up to $4 billion annually and open new markets among toddlers and dogs.

In a leaked internal memo, CEO Howard Schultz reassured employees: “Coffee may be scarce, but dirt is forever.”

At press time, Starbucks confirmed plans to release a Limited Edition Organic Gravel Cold Brew for summer 2026.",1,1755763294.0,onionheadlines,0,1.0,False
1mw4tag,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1mw4tag/f4a_apocalyptic_roleplay/,[F4A] Apocalyptic Roleplay,"Hello! I have decided to extend back out into the reddit channels in hopes for a new partner or two. I am specifically looking for an apocalyptic setting, starting at the beginning of said outbreak/virus, etc (details can be discussed in DMs)
**About me:** I am F/25+ and I am located in PST. 
I have been writing for about 15 years now, I usually match my partner and prefer the usual quality over quantity. I tend to write anywhere’s from 3 paragraphs to 5+ 
I play both male and female characters and tend to include side characters, also. 
I also like ooc chatter. I like to make new friends. 
A few extra points...

My literacy often reflects my partner’s. However, I consider myself adv.literate/novella. I adore lengthy posts. Quality over quantity.

I write both males and females, but only MxF pairings. I double, triple and use side characters. 

I prefer my partners to be 21+, but 18+ is also acceptable. I do write NSFW themes that don’t revolve around smut. 

That being said, I also love romance. Love/hate, forbidden, slow burn, all the cliches. 

If you need a day or two (or three!) to get out a response, then I’m fine with that. Sometimes I may take a day or two to think of a response. Other times, it comes naturally and only takes me 20 minutes. 

If I’m not interested, I will let you know. I expect the same. 

My only writing mediums currently are Discord and gdocs. 

I don’t care if you have faceclaims or not. I don’t care if they’re real life or not. I have a few claims for my characters, but I usually give descriptors in my writing. 

I like drama, angst, dark themes, anything and everything that can go wrong. I love torturing my characters for little reward. Let’s get into trouble.

Still here? Great! 
Below is something I've put together to set the tone. Details can be tweaked or changed, this only provides an idea of what I'm looking for.


~•~

Squinting at the bright screen that read ‘Eddy’, Lyla swiped right.

“...Hello?”

“Lyla, we need you at the office. Now.”

She took a moment to pull the phone away from her ear and tapped the screen to register the time.

“At four?” She questioned, “In the morning?”
“I can explain more when you get here. See you in ten minutes.”

“It takes ten minutes-” click.

-to get ready died on her lips and she sighed. So, no shower.


Setting the phone back on her bedside table, she glanced over at the figure next to her that had turned over, still asleep.

Whoever needed a lawyer at four in the morning was going to get an earful.


Lyla put on the first outfit she saw and managed to brush her teeth while trying to save her hair with some mousse.

She gave her husband a quick kiss on the cheek, who remained fast asleep.

Some coffee to go, and Lyla was on her way.


She was five minutes late in getting to the office, but Eddy didn’t seem to notice as he started talking a mile a minute the moment she stepped into the building.

“Woah, stop. I haven’t had my coffee and it’s early. Really. Early. Eddy.”

“There’s going to be a bulletin airing at eight this morning. I need you to pull everything we have on Actoflexiria. There’s been an outbreak. A big one. And we need to have our facts straight, plus the development process that was passed before we get hit with numerous lawsuits.”

Ah, so that’s why she was called in the early hours. She had to cover their ass.

“How do we know this is linked to Flex?”

“The sick ones are patients on Flex. Turn the news on at eight.”

Then I suppose I’ll be in my office. And Eddy, I expect breakfast.”


As Lyla went through her files, she wasn’t sure why this would be CDC business. The FDA approved of the drug; the CDC just made it.

It was quickly evident that her desk wasn’t sufficient enough to withstand all the files she had to pull and she was sitting in the middle of her office, surrounded by paper, when there was a knock on her door.

Lyla took the pen she held from between her teeth to answer, “Not now.” She answered, her brow furrowed.

The door opened anyways, admitting Daniel. He looked like he was going to say something and changed his mind, “So, you’ve heard.”

“No shit. Eddy thinks it’s Flex related. Except everything looks… fine. Even the clinical patients reported more pro side effects than the cons. No one minds a little nausea when they feel fit enough to run a marathon. And stress tests not only confirmed the newfound energy, they were able to follow through. So why are people getting sick?”

“I’m not sure.”
Lyla narrowed her eyes in annoyance, then softened her features, “At least Eddy will be pleased. I guess. Oh, it’s nearly eight.”
Four hours already? Damn.


Lyla extracted herself from her office floor and grabbed the remote to the television sitting in the corner of her office. Hitting the power button, the bulletin cut right in.

“Authorities have reported a significant rise in the death toll amid ongoing unrest, now reaching 300 confirmed fatalities. In response, local officials have implemented a strict curfew from 6:00pm to 6:00am in an effort to restore order and ensure public safety.

The curfew will take effect immediately and is expected to remain in place until further notice. Residents are urged to stay indoors during these hours, and law enforcement will be patrolling neighborhoods to enforce compliance. Authorities stress the importance of adhering to the curfew to allow emergency services to operate effectively and ensure the safety of all citizens. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available.”

“Death toll?” She questioned almost immediately, “Eddy said of an outbreak. I was confused enough about an outbreak through Flex, but… what?”

She clearly didn’t have all the facts, and data records weren’t going to help.


“Lyla-” Daniel tried, but she was already out the door.

The original goal of locating Eddy was short lived as the news seemed to cause a stir everywhere. If people weren’t going to demand answers from the hospitals, the CDC would be next on the list.


Nothing was normal about the day. Lyla had returned to her office, but work was the furthest from her mind. She scowled at the papers on her floor, figuring her early morning effort had proved worthless.

She stared out the window of her office, leaning her head against her arm. It took her a few minutes to realize that it wasn’t the usual ongoings in the street below. There was a heavier enforcement presence, but it was the people that caused her to lift her head in realization. Some looked fearful, others angry or upset. There was the odd person who kept to themselves. Anything but casual. Sirens had been heard wailing all day long.


Lyla stood straight, rubbing her eyes in a tired manner. It was nearing the newly placed curfew, though she was one of the few exempt. CDC perks, but her position didn’t seem like it would help too much at the moment. No one was currently thinking about suing the CDC, they were all too busy trying to wrap their head around what was happening. Lyla didn’t blame them, she was trying to do the same thing.


It was not knowing the exact circumstance. She had started pacing her office without realizing, running her hand through her hair multiple times.

Finally, she decided that Daniel might have some answers. He had the science knowledge that she lacked.

The building seemed relatively empty. Most had adhered to the curfew, probably thinking that it would be a temporary thing. Lyla hoped for the same, but she couldn’t decide on what she believed.

She scrubbed the back of her head as she waited for the elevator, figuring a good night’s sleep would do her some good after she spoke to Daniel. It had been a long day, to say the least.


She hit the button for Sector Seven, not prepared for what the elevator opened up to.

She was slow to step out of the elevator. Most of the glass lined lab cubicles had been smashed out and the entire sector seemed void of people.

“Daniel?” She called out tentatively. There was no answer, but an odd, wet sound greeted her instead.


Glass crunched under her shoes as she rounded a corner and could only react by clasping a hand over her mouth. Her eyes wide, she stared at an unimaginable scene. There was a lab rat, but it was the size of an average cat. Perhaps a bit bigger. But what she focused on was that the rat was intestine deep in a body. It had pieces in its’ large rodent hands, gnawing on it.

A sound escaped her and she had obtained the focus of the rat. It looked at her with a bloody face and she ran.


Lyla pressed the elevator button as fast as she could, hearing the animal behind her, but not daring to look. The doors opened and she slammed the lobby button, and repeatedly hit the button to close the doors. As the doors closed, the rat slammed into them, causing Lyla to jump back and she sank to the floor as the elevator started to move.

Her hands shook as she drew her knees up, putting her hands over her face. She only looked up when she reached the lobby and the doors opened.

Before she could move, something fell through the doors and it took a solid moment to register it was another body. She kicked it out of the way of the elevator sensors and hit whatever floor button she could reach and the close doors button once again. This time, when the elevator started to move, she hit the emergency stop button.


Still trembling, she slid her phone out of her pocket and dialed Daniel.

“Lyla?”
“Daniel! Are you okay? Where are you?”

“At home, where are you?”

“Stuck in the elevator at work. Daniel, what’s happening?” She could hear her voice crack.

“Stuck-? Nevermind. Look, you need to get home. I’m just not sure-”

“I’ll be there,” She promised, “Daniel, I love you.”

“I love you, too.”


Lyla hung up before anymore could be said and she took a shaky breath, wiping her cheeks. She dialed the only other number she could think of.

“9-1-1, what’s your emergency? Please note that we are assisting callers with needs that are directly affected by the situation currently going on.”
“I’m at the CDC, stuck in the elevator. There’s bodies and-” Lyla stopped herself, wondering if giant rats would make her sound crazy.

“Are you hurt?”
“No.”

“Alright, hang tight. We’ll send someone over. Are there any hostiles?”

“I- I don’t know.”

“Just a precaution. We have no estimated times, but we will get you out.”


She hung up and dropped her phone beside her, placing her face back in her hands, resting her arms on her legs. She took in a sharp breath, letting her body react, which included uncontrollable tears while she waited for someone, anyone to show up.


After the panic and adrenaline seemed to subside, Lyla removed her face from her hands. She couldn’t help but to replay what she saw down in Sector Seven. Every time she recalled the scene, she had to take several deep breaths so she wouldn’t physically react.

Her phone vibrated beside her and she took the distraction to look at it. An emergency notification had come out, reminding the people of the curfew. There was a mention of a danger to the ones who didn’t abide, but no specifics were given.

“Do giant, man-eating rats count?” She spoke to herself quite bitterly.


Lyla took a chance to look at the Nevada Appeal website for any articles that might shed some light on what was actually happening.

Rage takes control

Police struggle to keep up with calls

Conspirators claim The Purge is here.

A sound resounded from underneath her and she dropped her phone with a start. Her immediate thought was a gunshot. A voice followed, but it wasn’t clear. Was it help, or *something else*?


The elevator moved with a jerk and Lyla scrambled up, shoving her phone back in her pocket. Perhaps it was help, but she didn’t want to take any chances in case she had to run, again. Her brief research didn’t ease her fear.

The elevator doors opened and Lyla stared in turn at the four people standing before her. She felt compelled to mention the rat again, but instead, “I’m authorized to be out.., past curfew.”

She half fumbled for her clipped badge that was handed out earlier in the day that exempted her from curfew.

Whether they cared or not, she wasn’t sure. They all looked tired, more tired than herself. She probably didn’t look too great with disheveled hair and possible red, swollen eyes.

Lyla looked past the four, not seeing the body she had previously kicked out of the elevator.

“Does… Does anyone know what’s going on?”

The question sounded stupid in her own ears, but between what she saw in Sector Seven, the now-missing body and the news headlines, Lyla couldn’t connect anything. Enforcement had to know something.

What do you think?,"Have you heard that ChatGPT already supports Remote MCP connections?! You probably haven't noticed it yet, because it is only supported for **Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plan** only. It’s not yet for everyone, but the signs are clear: this is coming to all users soon, and it will be a **game changer**.

Trust me (a random dude from the Internet) — when it does, it’s going to blow the doors wide open. 🚀

# ⚡ What MCP Is (Plain English):

>

MCP stands for **Model Context Protocol** — a new standard that lets AI models like ChatGPT connect to **external tools, APIs, and data sources** in real time.

**MCP** is Like **USB-C for ChatGPT**. One common plug to safely connects ChatGPT to *any tool or data, any website, cloud application, service*.... anything! Need to order pizza? Schedule a ride home? Send email, pay for grocery, rent a car, buy a flight ticket, submit tax declaration, send flowers with a gift card to your sweethart - all done by chatting with ChatGPT!

***If this is not a Brave New World, I don't know what it is ...***

# 💡 What is Remote MCP?

Remote MCP is MCP server that you run somewhere, which has your credentials to connect to all of these tools and is a code that translates ChatGPT commands into the API calls to a respective service.

***THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MCP SERVERS IN GITHUB ALREADY!*** ANd this number is growing every single day!!!

# But there is a BUT...

**Remote MCP** means those tools don’t have to live on your computer — they can be running somewhere out there in the cloud, ready for ChatGPT to call whenever you need them.

**And here is a CATCH:**

Here’s the thing… MCP isn’t just something you *download*.  
You actually have to **run** it somewhere. And unless you have:

* A PhD in Computer Science
* 10+ years of software development under your belt
* Or a license in certified *black magic programming*

…you probably won’t get it working without a few tears, a gallon of coffee, and maybe a minor existential crisis.

# Enter: MCP Cloud ☁️✨

We are building [MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/) is here to save the day!

**MCP Cloud is a new Platform that will help you to:**

* Run MCP tools without setting up scary servers
* Share them with other people instantly
* Even make a little money if you want to offer your tool to others

*When Remote MCP becomes available to all ChatGPT users, you won’t need to know how it works under the hood — you’ll just click “connect” and boom: ChatGPT can use your favorite tool, fetch your data, or automate your work.*

# But wait. There is even more!

***MCP Cloud is the first platform that lets you earn from your MCP servers!***

We integrate payments into our MCP gateway.

*Are you an aspiring software developer, data scientist, or domain expert who developed a useful MCP server? Whether it does stock-price forecasting, fraud/anomaly detection, credit scoring, legal advicing, contract review, web data extraction, SEO audits, demand forecasting, AI agent personalization, code analysis or compliance checks, list it on MCP Cloud and monetize. Set your price and license terms, get built-in analytics and billing, make your MCP server discoverable and turn your expertise into recurring revenue.*

# Where do we stand now

We are a small team working relentlessly on the [MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/). Our **Beta release** has happened only a few days ago, ***but we already serve our first users!!!***

We are actively testing and improving our yet small platform.

**What are the next steps**

We are building community. We are looking for anyone who feels MCP is the future of an Agentic AI, and who wants to become part of it:

Or Does My BD Care Too Much About His Exes?,"Hi Reddit, I’ve been struggling with this issue in the back of my head for months now and I need some help. I can’t talk to any friends or family about it for fear of being judged or that they won’t look at my boyfriend the same way. I’m worried I’m being an idiot and either way I don’t know how to bring it up to my boyfriend without coming across like I’m crazy or he has to worry about me being insecure. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years and he really is perfect in every way… almost. It’s been smooth sailing with us and he treats me like a queen. Our relationship is truly like a fairy tale. The only problem is his exes. I probably read too much Reddit but it’s always made me paranoid that he keeps in touch with them. He says it’s because it’s important to him to maintain a relationship because he lost a friend once after they dated. He says these two girls really helped him at a time in his life when he needed someone but it bothers me. Here’s the situation: the first red flag was when I took him on a family trip over the holidays with me and my parents. They treat him like a son and I couldn’t bring myself to tell them or anyone what happened on the trip. I was too humiliated. He told me one morning that he was going to meet an ex girlfriend for coffee and he wanted me to know because he didn’t want to hurt me and risk losing us by hiding it. He told me he thought about not telling me, til after they went (which I don’t know if I believe is true). He also said he didn’t want to seem ungrateful or disrespectful while on a generous trip with my family. He sent me his location too so that I could have his trust and I saw when they met they also went to a farmers market nearby. This always made me feel in the back of my mind like it was more borderlining a date. I didn’t read into the whole exchange though because he was so honest and respectful about it, but it did make me weary of the fact that he had contact with exes. The other time I felt like things were off was when we were on a trip with his family, and I saw over his shoulder that he sent a silly photo of some souvenirs with a reference to an inside joke, to another ex from his uni trip abroad. She is from Poland and I never felt like it was a problem that they were in contact because he said he knew it wouldn’t work but they had a strong friendship. I got really upset when this happened on the trip though and told him, mentioning that it made me uncomfortable that he didn’t say something before and it made me question the first encounter with first ex on the trip with my family. He reassured me though and was so understanding and willing to work on it. 

He loves me and we see a future together even though our lives are just getting started and we don’t know what will happen overtime. All I know is we want to work on growing together. I love him so much it hurts, and I don’t know if I can handle hearing the opinions of people in my life that might be biased, so I need to hear it from a fresh perspective.

This isn’t just about hobby groups, it’s about tapping into interests people are already willing to pay for.

Here’s the basic model:

* **Pick a theme people want.** The more specific the better. Business networking events, senior community gatherings, wellness workshops, dating advice seminars, these draw people who are actively looking for connections and knowledge.
* **Find a venue.** Coffee shops, co-working spaces, restaurants with a private room, or community halls often work. Some places will even let you use space for free if you bring in paying attendees.
* **Promote it.** Facebook Events and Meetup are the go-to tools. They make it easy to get RSVPs and handle payments without needing your own website.
* **Charge for tickets.** Even small amounts add up. A $15–$30 ticket, with 50 people attending, quickly turns into $750–$1,500 for a single event. Bigger or more specialized events can go higher.

Why this works:

* People are tired of only interacting online and want real-world connections.
* They’re willing to pay for structured, curated experiences instead of random meetups.
* Once you build consistency, word of mouth keeps attendance growing.

Plenty of organizers are quietly making thousands each month just by hosting these gatherings. It’s not complicated, it’s about spotting what people in your city are interested in, giving them a place to meet, and creating value around it.

If you’ve ever thought about starting something local, this is one of the easiest low-cost ways to get going.",4,1755762948.0,MakeMoneyHacks,0,1.0,False

1mw4omk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mw4omk/mint_and_metal/,Mint and Metal,"I walk home after late shifts. It’s a boring route I could do half-asleep: across the tram tracks, past the shuttered bakery, up the concrete stairs to my building. Nothing ever happens. That’s kind of the point. It’s the part of the night where your brain goes quiet and your feet do the rest.

First thing that threw me off was the stair rail in my building. The metal has a cheap paint on it that flakes if you scrape it with your keys. I grabbed the rail like always and felt rough patches under my palm—little bumps where it should’ve been smooth. When I leaned in, there was a cluster of tiny marks at elbow height. Not scratches. Not a key drag. It looked like someone had pressed their teeth into the paint and tested a bite, over and over, in a neat line. Half-moons with little ridges.

I said out loud, “Okay?” to nobody, and laughed because it was a dumb thing to say. Maybe some kid did it as a joke. Maybe a stray dog looking for something to munch on. I wiped my hand on my jacket and went upstairs.

The next night I walked into the lobby and the elevator doors were already open. Nobody inside. I got in, hit my floor, and only then noticed the smell. Not the usual piss and cigarettes. Mint. Like toothpaste. Clean, bright mint, and under it a metallic tang, like a handful of coins. It wasn’t strong, just there. I checked the corners of the elevator for a urinal cake or something weird. Nothing. The camera dome in the corner had a faint smear on it. At a certain angle it looked like a mouth print. It was probably a hand. 

On my floor I got out and listened before unlocking my door, because that’s what you do when a smell puts a thought in your head. The hallway was quiet. I slept badly anyway and blamed the coffee I’d had too late.

Third night, I heard a clicking sound on the street. Not loud. Just every few steps: click. I stopped and it stopped. I walked and it started again, like it was syncing with my footfalls. Teeth tapping together. I didn’t want to think that, but once I thought it, I couldn’t unthink it. The street behind me was empty in the hazy orange light. I did the thing where you pretend to check your phone so you can turn your head without looking scared. Nothing there. I went inside, took the stairs two at a time, and didn’t touch the rail.

Fourth night I decided I was being stupid and went the long way around, past the parking lot where the delivery trucks sit. Someone had wheeled a dumpster to the curb, one of those big green ones with a split lid. The left lid was up and a short person was standing with their head inside the opening. That’s what it looked like, anyway. I made a point of not staring. People dig through recycling; it’s not a horror movie. When I got to the corner, the lid clapped shut like someone let it drop, and the sound made me flinch. I kept walking. At the glass door to my building I caught my reflection and I looked like a person pretending they weren’t hurrying.

Inside, Marek the night guard had his small TV on with the volume down. He likes to talk. He said, “You see the kids putting gum on the camera again?” and laughed, pointing at the elevator view on his monitor. I said no and he rewound a little for me. It was mostly an empty lobby loop, slowed down, sped up, the way he plays with it. Then there was this one freeze—just one frame where the lens looked fogged from the outside, fogged and pressed in a shape that could’ve been a grin. Then back to normal. He said, “Freeze-frames always look stupid.” I nodded like I agreed. I didn’t ask him to rewind again.

The fifth day it rained hard, the kind of rain that makes the sidewalks flash inside the streetlights. The bakery’s awning had a rip that spit water right at the curb. I was skirting the edge to avoid the splash when a delivery van cut the turn and I stepped off the curb without thinking. My foot hit slick metal. I slipped, grabbed for the lamppost, and heard the clink that makes your stomach drop before your brain catches up.

Keys. They went down the storm drain.

It wasn’t a deep one with a grate you could pry up, either. It was one of those long, skinny slits that swallow things and pretend they never existed. I swore out loud and then swore again, louder. The rain made it hard to see. The keys were there, just inside the opening, caught on something. I could see the blue supermarket tag bobbing in the runoff. I got on my knees in the puddle and reached, and at the last second they slipped one notch deeper. Not gone, but out of finger range.

I looked around. No one on the street. The van was already up the block. I tried to hook them with a twig. It snapped. I thought about calling Marek to come down with a magnet or a hanger, but I’d left my phone at eight percent and it had already died. I swore a third time because why not, then leaned in and said, “Come on,” like the water would hear me.

Something moved in the dark gap under the grate. It wasn’t big. A small hand came up, pale and careful, with short fingers and neat nails. It took the key ring between two fingers and fed it up through the slit. The keys rose, dripping, and tangled it what looked like some old dental floss. I froze just long enough for the part of my brain that likes to ask questions to say, Where is that arm coming from? Did a squirel or some rodent just handed me the keys? I'm tripping...maybe i shouln't have eatem that brownie after all, but it looked to good to pass on. Then I did the only thing you do when a stranger hands you your keys from a place no person should be: I took them.

“Thanks,” I said automatically, like I had good manners. The hand slid back down, quick and tidy. The keys were looped with a short length of dental floss, tied in a clean square knot I didn’t make.

I stood there with rain in my eyes, a wet knee, and my keys in my hand, thinking about how I was going to tell this story to a person without sounding like I’d made it up. I walked away fast because standing there seemed worse. The floss hung off the ring and tapped against my knuckles with each step, and I didn’t want it to touch me but I also didn’t want to pull it off and drop it in the street. The feeling was dumb and real at the same time.

In the lobby, Marek wasn’t at his desk. The elevator doors were closed. I took the stairs and kept my eyes pointed at the center of each step like I was counting. At my door I fumbled the lock because the floss had twisted around the front-door key and tightened itself.

I put the keys in the ceramic bowl by my bed, peeled my wet socks off, and sat on the edge of the mattress thinking about the feel of that hand. It hadn’t been cold, the way you imagine something from a drain. .It was also careful, like the hand of someone who didn’t want to get bitten by a dog.

I woke up with a coin under my pillow. Not one of mine. It was too light, with a hole drilled near one edge like a charm. The metal was dull and had that old pocket smell. My gums were sore on the upper right for no good reason. When I prodded the spot with my tongue, a sharp stab shot through my jaw and watered my eyes. I hadn’t dreamed anything that would explain waking up with a souvenir, so I did what you do when you don’t know how to process something: I put the coin in my nightstand and pretended it was a prank I’d done to myself. That brownie was crazy.

In the bathroom I spat pink and saw a thin pale line on the gum above that molar, a straight line like someone had drawn it with dental floss and pressed hard. I stood there with the toothbrush in my mouth  confused.

I moved the ceramic bowl to the dresser and set the keys inside it, floss and all. I realised i never removed the tangled floss. The know on it was neat and small. A better knot than I could tie.

Later that day I booked a dentist appointment because that tooth didn’t feel like the pain was gona go away.. The receptionist had one of those voices that makes everything sound like a solution. “Tomorrow afternoon? Great, we’ll see you then.” I almost told her why, just to hear what it sounded like out loud, and stopped myself in time.

In the elevator the air smelled mint-clean again, then coin-sharp when the doors closed. It was faint, like it had soaked into the carpet. I hit the button for the lobby and watched the floor numbers. Somewhere between floors the cab made a soft bell sound it doesn’t make, like a tone from a different building snuck into this one. The doors opened on the basement for no reason. The light down there is on a motion sensor and it didn’t come on. I hit my floor again and the doors closed too slowly. I stood in the mirror with my own face and didn’t turn around to see if anyone else had gotten in because I didn’t want to be the kind of person who checks.

When I got home that evening, the building chat we have had a photo of the little boy from 4B grinning with a missing front tooth, thumbs up. It was neat little thing, we were all friendly and nice and liked to chat. Reminded us of those old MSN days. The caption from his mom said, “Look who’s growing up!” People posted hearts and tooth emojis. I typed “nice” and erased it and typed “congrats” and erased that too because I didn’t feel like saying anything.

I listened for the clicking that night and didn’t hear it. That should’ve been reassuring. It wasn’t. Around the time I usually fall asleep, the bowl on the dresser rattled once. A small ceramic sound like a coin settling after a long slide. I stared at the ceiling and told myself it was the windows. The bowl did it again, a polite little knock. I sat up and looked. Nothing moved. The floss tail hung over the rim and swung, then eased to still.

I took a photo of the keys so I’d have proof they’d moved if they moved. I watched the photo for a long time like an idiot, as if it were going to show me more than the real thing.

At the dentist I tried to explain the ache without sounding like a person who bites down hard when they’re anxious. “It’s this one,” I said, tapping the molar. He poked and tapped and made the little thinking sounds they make.

“You’ve got a microfracture starting at the root,” he said. “Strange pattern. Almost like something was chipping at it. You could wait and see or we can schedule an extraction and be done with it, but its not realy there yet. It's up to you. But i do need to remind you your insurance has expired. If you want this done before you renew it, its gona cost you, but you could also take some painkillers and wait and see.”

“Wait and see,” I said automatically. He offered me a bite guard for grinding. I said yes to the guard because it made me look like someone with a normal problem.

At the counter, the bowl of candy was all peppermints. I reached and then didn’t, suddenly sure I’d be rude if I touched anything mint with my mouth.

When I came back to the building, the boy from 4B was dragging his scooter over the lobby tile. He stopped by Marek’s desk and told him very seriously that his tooth fairy had a voice like a man on TV. “Did you say thank you?” his mom asked. He nodded. “He said I owe him when I get my big teeth,” the kid said, and the mom laughed and said, “You owe me not to leave your scooter in the hall.”

I went upstairs and closed my door and leaned my head against it. I know kids lie. I know they tell big stories. It didn’t matter. The words stuck anyway and repeated themselves: I owe him when I get my big teeth.

That night I taped over the bedroom vent with masking tape I found in the junk drawer. I put the chair under the handle of the door even though the lock turns the other way. I took a kitchen towel and crammed it against the gap at the floor because some part of me needed to be busy. When I was done, I stood there and felt stupid and less exposed at the same time.

I put the keys and the coin from my nightstand in the ceramic bowl and set it on the dresser. The coin looked harmless. It had little dots around the edge where you could imagine a country name but there wasn’t one. I sat on the bed and waited for the bowl to rattle. It didn’t. When it finally did, I had started to drift and the sound snapped me back. It was quieter than the night before. A second later, something touched the bottom of the bowl from underneath, like a knuckle, and then went still.

I did not look in the mirror above the dresser. I didn’t want to see anything over my shoulder. I lay back down and watched the door and finally slept because you can’t not sleep forever.

When I woke up, the bowl was arranged differently. The keys were on top of the coin with the floss tail draped neatly over the rim. The knot had been retied tighter. The tooth pain was worse and now there was a taste in my mouth like chewing a penny. In the bathroom I ran my tongue over the gum and felt a thin ridge, straight and purposeful. I spat blood once and then water until it ran clear, and caught myself staring at the pliers in the cabinet, and sudenly felt this strong urge, that i coulnt explain..It was a bad idea but for some strange reason it felt so natural to do, like i was suposed to do it. I shruged it off.

I went to work and did my job and tried to think of anything else. You know how your brain will not let go of a word once you’ve said it out loud? The word “thanks” sat like a pebble in a shoe at the front of everything I tried to think. I said it without thinking when the hand lifted my keys. I made the deal I didn’t understand. It sounded stupid phrased like that. That didn’t make it feel untrue.

In the hallway that afternoon, the elevator bell made a soft chime even though nobody pressed it. The doors opened on my floor. I stood in my doorway and watched. The car was empty. The air inside it smelled like the dentist’s tray after he opened the little packet of tools. The doors stayed open longer than they’re supposed to and then drifted shut, gentle as eyelids.

I got a message from the building chat that evening: the kid from 4B had a nosebleed that scared his mom and she took him to urgent care. He was okay. It was “just one of those things.” People posted hearts and “poor guy” and advice about humidifiers. I typed “get well soon” and sent it because not sending anything felt like saying nothing on purpose.

I boiled water in a pot for too long. The kitchen filled with steam and I didn’t turn the fan on because the fan noise makes me think of empty tunnels. I put the pliers in the boiling water and set them on a clean towel and didn’t touch them for a long time. When I finally sat on the closed toilet and opened my mouth in the mirror, my hands shook hard enough to make the reflection look like someone I didn’t want to see. I put the pliers down again.

Here’s the part people will judge me for because people love to judge the part where you choose to hurt yourself on purpose. I didn’t want to do it. I also didn’t want to be the only person in the building who knew about the hand in the drain and the little neat knot and the bowl that knocks once to be polite. I didn’t want to go to the boy’s mom and say something that would get me a nickname in the chat and a private email from the landlord. I sat there with my front tooth throbbing and made a decision that felt ugly and clean.

The molar they said was already cracked came easier than I thought once I committed. I’m not going to write a blow-by-blow. There’s no bravery in it. The pliers were hot from the water. I wrapped the handles in the towel and held fast and pulled the way they tell you not to in every story your grandparents ever told. Pain smacked my vision white for a second and then went grey and then settled into a deep ache. I rinsed with salt water and shook all over and laughed once in a way I didn’t like, and the laugh turned into a cough because my throat tasted like blood and mint even though I hadn’t put anything mint in my mouth.

I wrapped the tooth in tissue and put it in the bowl with the keys. I added the coin from the nightstand on top like a tip for a server you don’t want to offend. I wiped the rim of the bowl with the corner of the towel and felt crazy because who was I cleaning up for. And strange thing was, this felt so natural and normal and i still do not know why i did this, it was like i had instructions, but that wasn't the case.

I went to bed and lay on my side to keep the blood from pooling at the back of my throat. 

In the morning the bowl was empty. Not completely; the floss knot was still there, curled like a tiny white worm, laid across the bottom. The coin was gone. The tissue was gone. The keys were gone too, until I checked the hook by my door. Its there for the keys but i literaly never use it.  I found them there, the front-door key now tied with the same small neat knot, floss wrapped and trimmed like a craft project. The knot was tight enough that it seemed part of the key.

My jaw hurt but in a honest way—post-pain, not the worrying kind. The cut line in the gum looked cleaner than it had a right to look. The bathroom smelled like boiled metal and toothpaste. I opened the window and the smell left like it had been waiting by the latch.

The building chat said the boy’s bleeding had stopped. A photo followed: him with a band-aid under his nose, chewing on a popsicle, the caption saying “He’s fine! Thank you everyone.” People posted hearts. I typed nothing and closed the app. My tongue went automatically to the gap and then flinched away from it.

That evening, I put the keys in my pocket and told myself not to look for anything. Not in the lobby, not in the hall, not in the mirror in the elevator that makes you glance down the long reflected hallway behind you even if you know nothing is there. The elevator didn’t ring a wrong bell. The mint smell was gone. The stair rail had new marks lower down, at a kid’s height, tidy half-moons in a row.

On my windowsill there was a tiny chip of enamel. Not mine. Smoother, like it had been carried in a pocket a long time. It was shaped like the top of a key. I flicked it off the sill with my nail and it landed somewhere behind the radiator where a thousand other lost things live.

I kept going to work. I kept coming home. Nothing dramatic happened for a few days and then it started to slide back in the way it does. The elevator chimed a bell I still haven’t heard during the day. The bowl clicked on nights I forgot to put the keys in it. I started to lock my door even when I took out the trash. Normal precautions turned into habits, and I tried not to think about who the habits were for.

I saw the short figure once more, across the street near the bins, standing very still and looking into the glossy side of a black plastic bag like it was a mirror. The streetlight made a reflection I couldn’t quite parse. Head tilted, posture neat, hands together like a person waiting for a bus. I kept walking because what else do you do. When I got to the corner, someone behind me clicked their teeth, quick and tidy, the way you do when you’re lining up a thought. I didn’t turn around. You would have kept walking too.

A few practical notes, since that’s the only part of this that feels like it might be useful:

If you drop your keys and a stranger returns them with dental floss tied to the ring, get a new lock. Don’t take the keys if you can help it. If you already took them without thinking and your mouth starts to ache for no reason, go to a dentist and get something small taken out before something bigger is asked for. If you wake up with a coin under your pillow and you don’t live with anyone who would find that funny, don’t put the coin somewhere special. Coins are for circulation. Let it circulate away.

If a kid tells you their tooth fairy talks, don’t laugh it off. Don’t scare them. Just put their tooth in a drawer and tape over the bedroom vent for a few nights, and maybe leave a piece of enamel you can spare in a bowl by the door with the keys. You will feel stupid and you’ll sleep better. Paying something forward doesn’t have to be a good thing.

If you smell mint and metal where mint and metal shouldn’t be, check that your keys are where you left them. If they aren’t, don’t call down the vent. Don’t say thank you into a drain. Manners matter, but not always in the way you think.

I keep telling myself it’s over because nothing has happened this week beyond ordinary apartment noises. The floss knot is still tied on my front-door key, neat and flat, and sometimes I catch myself rubbing it with my thumb like it’s a worry bead. I’m not going to cut it off. It feels like cutting it would be a kind of rudeness I can’t afford.

On my way home tonight, a jogger passed me on the sidewalk with his mouth open in the way people do when they breathe through their teeth, and the click of it made me tense up without thinking. He kept going, normal and sweaty, and I stood there and counted to five in my head before moving again. On the stairs I let my hand hover over the rail and then caught myself doing it and put my palm down on the paint anyway, pressing hard. You can live in a place and still choose not to see the marks.

Nothing bad happened while I finished typing this. That feels important to say even if it means nothing. If anything changes, I’ll know it before anyone else does. That’s the other part people won’t say out loud: once you’ve owed and paid, it doesn’t leave you alone. It just lets you walk ahead for a while.

***-""And if someone behind me clicks their teeth again, I still won’t turn around. Not because I’m brave. Not because om scared...but because I already know the shape of that smile.""-***

1mw4nvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersuasionExperts/comments/1mw4nvu/magnitude_compression_or_logarithmic_bias_why_big/,Magnitude Compression or Logarithmic Bias: Why Big Differences Feel Small and How You Can Take Advantage of This,"|| || |Rambling Introduction| |

There are two types of biases, well actually depending on how we categorize them there are many and varied types of biases. One way we can categorize biases however, is by distinguishing by those which work even when the subject is fully aware of them. This/these counting and number based biases fall into this category. Lets jump into it.

As numbers get larger, we perceive the differences between them to be smaller. In other words, our sensitivity to changes in magnitude diminishes as the magnitude grows​. An extra couple of zeroes on a big number just doesn’t feel as significant as it logically should. 

Imagine you’re shopping for a blender. Store A is 10 minutes away, store B is 30 minutes away. Store A sells it for $50, Store B for $30. You’d drive, or at least pause and consider driving, to store B to save $20. Now imagine you are going to buy a computer at $1,050 versus $1,030. It’s the same $20 difference, but you might not bother, it seems trivial in the context of a thousand-dollar purchase. Objectively $20 is $20, but subjectively it shrinks in importance next to a large base price. This is magnitude compression at work.|

People will expend effort to save $5 on a $25 purchase, but won’t think twice about $5 or $10 on a $500 purchase. We gauge valued relatively. This is why subscription services advertise “only $5 a month (the price of a coffee!)” instead of the $60 annual amount.| 

On a graph, big-ticket costs look small next to giant totals. A $100 difference means little on a $10,000 deal but can make or break a $500 deal. **The bigger the baseline, the smaller a given change feels.**

**Actionable tactics**

**Make costs feel tiny:** Describe prices or fees in the smallest convenient units. *“That’s about $1 a day”* sounds more palatable than *“$365 per year.”* You’re leveraging the fact that $365 compresses into insignificance when framed as a daily dollar. This reframing taps a “coffee a day” style analogy that makes the cost feel like a negligible habit​. 

**Anchor on relative savings:** In negotiations, express concessions as a percentage of a much larger whole to downplay them. Instead of saying *“we’re $5,000 apart,”* say *“that’s just 1% of the entire contract value.”* A small percentage on a large base feels minor. (Just be careful: this can backfire if the other party *doesn’t* feel the base cost is justified to begin with.) 

**Speak in ratios for big impact:** If you want to impress someone with growth or change, use multiplicative language: *“5× improvement”*, *“grew 300%”*, or *“one order of magnitude higher.”*  Our ears perk up at factor changes. A marketing team might report, *“We increased engagement tenfold,”* knowing that sounds more impressive than *“increased by 900 units”* because “tenfold” hits that logarithmic instinct of a big leap. 

**Baseline manipulation**: Present costs alongside larger numbers to trigger compression. A $10,000 expense seems reasonable against a $500,000 project total, despite being substantial in absolute terms.

**Rescale huge numbers with analogies:**  When communicating numbers beyond everyday scale, give a log-scale analogy to make them relatable. Instead of saying *“the distance to the sun is 150,000,000 km,”* say *“that’s like driving around the Earth 3,750 times.”*  In finance you might not assume a reader truly grasps a trillion dollars. Translate it: *“a trillion dollars is roughly the entire economy of Mexico in one year.”*  By putting giant numbers into familiar reference points, you essentially linearize them on a human scale so they don’t all just register as “a really big number.” This thwarts the log bias to your advantage, helping people appreciate differences at the high end. 

**Left-digit exploitation**: Cross numerical boundaries for disproportionate psychological impact. $300 to $299 feels like a major reduction because the brain processes ""3-hundred"" versus ""2-hundred-something."" The single dollar triggers responses equivalent to much larger drops. 

**Range structuring**: Create pricing tiers that feel evenly spaced: $10, $100, $1,000. Human cognition perceives these as gradual progression despite exponential increases due to logarithmic mental mapping.| 

**Defense against the bias**

Be mindful when dealing with big numbers. Deliberately *linearize* the situation by looking at absolute differences and percentages together. If you catch yourself thinking “eh, what’s another $10,000 on a house purchase,” step back and note that $10,000 could furnish your living room – it’s real money. Reframe large differences into concrete terms (*“That $10,000 is 5 more monthly mortgage payments”*). Conversely, if a small monthly fee feels harmless, multiply it out (*“$1 a day is $365 a year, $3,650 in a decade”*) to restore proper scale. 

The key is to counter the natural compression by consciously expanding the number in context.

**Final Ramble**

As I mentioned this bias operates below conscious awareness. Subjects remain vulnerable even after education about magnitude compression. Knowledge of a bias differs fundamentally from the cognitive effort required to counteract it consistently.| |The technique works because it feels natural—subjects aren't being deceived but rather experiencing normal cognitive processing. The influence lies in structuring numerical presentation to exploit rather than counteract these natural tendencies.| |Effectiveness increases when combined with time pressure or cognitive load, as these conditions reduce the mental resources available for deliberate linear calculation.|

It was working quite well until he decided that he wants the separation to end. Since I didn’t insist on the NC, now I haven’t had time to set the boundary back up as he has started to love-bomb me via text, make grandiose promises of support, and start doing things like making me coffee in the morning.

I did tell him that I am not ready for the separation to end. Several times. But he seems to be quickly changing the terms, messaging multiple times a day with really kind words. I know it’s a Hoover. I know this. And I know he’s counting on me to not step into being a bitch and tell him to back off.

It’s also tough because I didn’t set clear guidance on what I needed to see to end it - except that I wanted sustained change and commitment to therapy. It seems like he is doing it, so shouldn’t that be enough for me?

I’m not ready. In fact, I’ve been enjoying the peace of life at a distance from him. But I feel this intense obligation to give him a second chance while I also KNOW that I should be prioritizing myself and my own needs over his. 

It’s amazing how I can feel so much resistance to his advances (my mind trying desperately to break the pattern) and so much comfort in how he’s helping me (my nervous system stuck in the trauma bond).

What do you think?,"Have you heard that ChatGPT already supports Remote MCP connections?! You probably haven't noticed it yet, because it is only supported for **Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plan** only. It’s not yet for everyone, but the signs are clear: this is coming to all users soon, and it will be a **game changer**.

Trust me (a random dude from the Internet) — when it does, it’s going to blow the doors wide open. 🚀

# ⚡ What MCP Is (Plain English):

>

MCP stands for **Model Context Protocol** — a new standard that lets AI models like ChatGPT connect to **external tools, APIs, and data sources** in real time.

**MCP** is Like **USB-C for ChatGPT**. One common plug to safely connects ChatGPT to *any tool or data, any website, cloud application, service*.... anything! Need to order pizza? Schedule a ride home? Send email, pay for grocery, rent a car, buy a flight ticket, submit tax declaration, send flowers with a gift card to your sweethart - all done by chatting with ChatGPT!

***If this is not a Brave New World, I don't know what it is ...***

# 💡 What is Remote MCP?

Remote MCP is MCP server that you run somewhere, which has your credentials to connect to all of these tools and is a code that translates ChatGPT commands into the API calls to a respective service.

***THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MCP SERVERS IN GITHUB ALREADY!*** ANd this number is growing every single day!!!

# But there is a BUT...

**Remote MCP** means those tools don’t have to live on your computer — they can be running somewhere out there in the cloud, ready for ChatGPT to call whenever you need them.

**And here is a CATCH:**

Here’s the thing… MCP isn’t just something you *download*.  
You actually have to **run** it somewhere. And unless you have:

* A PhD in Computer Science
* 10+ years of software development under your belt
* Or a license in certified *black magic programming*

…you probably won’t get it working without a few tears, a gallon of coffee, and maybe a minor existential crisis.

# Enter: MCP Cloud ☁️✨

We are building [MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/) is here to save the day!

**MCP Cloud is a new Platform that will help you to:**

* Run MCP tools without setting up scary servers
* Share them with other people instantly
* Even make a little money if you want to offer your tool to others

*When Remote MCP becomes available to all ChatGPT users, you won’t need to know how it works under the hood — you’ll just click “connect” and boom: ChatGPT can use your favorite tool, fetch your data, or automate your work.*

# But wait. There is even more!

***MCP Cloud is the first platform that lets you earn from your MCP servers!***

We integrate payments into our MCP gateway.

*Are you an aspiring software developer, data scientist, or domain expert who developed a useful MCP server? Whether it does stock-price forecasting, fraud/anomaly detection, credit scoring, legal advicing, contract review, web data extraction, SEO audits, demand forecasting, AI agent personalization, code analysis or compliance checks, list it on MCP Cloud and monetize. Set your price and license terms, get built-in analytics and billing, make your MCP server discoverable and turn your expertise into recurring revenue.*

# Where do we stand now

We are a small team working relentlessly on the [MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/). Our **Beta release** has happened only a few days ago, ***but we already serve our first users!!!***

We are actively testing and improving our yet small platform.

**What are the next steps**

We are building community. We are looking for anyone who feels MCP is the future of an Agentic AI, and who wants to become part of it:

\- collaborators

\- business developers

\- promoters

\- partners

\- testers

Sorry for the broad genre request.

Anyway I really enjoyed all the Agatha Christie's novels that I have read, as well as the Dresden files from Jim Butcher, and most recently The Chalk Man by C. J. Tudor. I also read Manga and I loved Death Note, Hellsing and Monster.

But my current favourite book is The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon.

Also I have a compilation of the works from H.P. Lovecraft, but I honestly can't get into it, I think it's his way of writing ( although I understand for the time it must have been awesome), I read half the works and I can't push myself to read the rest.

Jay was famished and he couldn’t wait to pick up some Chinese takeout for dinner at Chun Li as he and Paula boarded the same train that they boarded every night to get back home. They immediately spotted several familiar faces. She made some small talk with a woman named Kelly from Bronxville as he took a seat by himself and popped open his laptop. The train pulled out of the station and soon the lights of the city were quickly racing past outside the window like sparks blowing away from a bonfire as Jay tried to bang out a few emails that he never found the time to respond to before leaving the office that night.

“When is Maurice returning from Madrid? We haven’t seen him in at least a week or so! When does he get back?” Paula, ever the social butterfly, was now bringing a woman named Sarah from Tuckahoe into the conversation. The three were quickly chatting away. Jay loved his wife deeply. She was his moon and stars, though she quietly found this pop cultural reference somewhat embarrassing, much like many other things in the world.

After a while Jay closed his eyes when the train stopped at the East 233rd Street Station. It had been a long day and he was both tired and hungry. He didn’t think that he had drifted off for more than a few minutes but when he awoke Paula was gone.

“Hey, where did Paula go?”

Kelly pursed her lips and glanced briefly at Sarah, then she just shook her head as she discreetly inched herself a little further away. Jay lost his patience and moved off towards the front of the train. In the next car he found the conductor.

“Excuse me, sir. I can’t find my wife. Have you seen a woman with long reddish hair wearing a dark green dress? She’s almost my height? She’s wearing a silver brooch in the shape of a French bulldog.”

The conductor just looked down, shook his head, and moved around Jay without saying a word. The search continued from one end of the train to the other but when Paula never turned up Jay exited at his stop, hoping to find her at home with some logical explanation for her sudden disappearance. He was no longer hungry.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The next morning he woke up and went to work and that night he and Paula boarded the same Metro North train at Grand Central Station, the one that they rode back up to their home in Westchester County every night at that same time. They were running a little late, as always, and while they hustled down towards the open doors Paula looked across the platform for just a moment as another train, this one coming in from Connecticut, cruised into the station on a parallel set of tracks.

Jay was starving and couldn’t think about anything other than picking up some Italian takeout from Pasquale’s as he and Paula boarded the train, the same one that they boarded every night. They immediately spotted several familiar faces. She made some small talk with a guy named Arthur from Hartsdale and his fiance, Maggie. She asked them about their recent trip to the Cayman Islands. Jay took a seat across the aisle and popped open his laptop to finish up work on a report that was due the following morning. The train pulled out of the station and soon the lights of the city were racing past outside the window like an endless swarm of fireflies.

It had been a long and busy day so Jay closed his eyes for a few minutes as the train reached the East 233rd Street Station. He had a slow-building headache and he rubbed his temples with his thumbs for a little while and dozed off momentarily. When he awoke Paula was no longer there.

“Hey Arthur, where did Paula go? I must have nodded off for a few minutes.”

The man just looked briefly at his fiance and then they both lowered their chins. Jay asked again but neither of them looked up or said a word. He stuffed his laptop into his backpack and started walking up towards the front of the train. Paula was nowhere to be found.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The next morning he and Paula made love, but it felt wrong. It always felt wrong now, like she wasn’t really there, and neither was he. Like it was an obligatory duty that needed to be fulfilled, by both of them, to neither's satisfaction. On the way into the city on the train that morning she opened up to him, just a little bit.

“I’m not happy, Jay. I’m not happy, and I don’t know why. I should be happy. I should be delighted with my life. I know this. You are perfect. My job is awesome. My family is great. Everyone and everything is really good, but…somehow, I’m just not happy. I’m just…I’m not.”

He thought for a short time.

“Maybe you should, you know, talk to someone. Someone who can help?” He had looked into the prescription pill bottle containing her anti-depressant medication the night before. There were twenty seven tablets remaining. There should have been only four.

She just looked down at her lap. Soon the train reached Grand Central Terminal and he kissed her beneath the famed Zodiac celestial ceiling mural in the main concourse as they parted ways until it was time to meet up again for the train ride back home that evening, just like every evening. She looked back at him once as she exited through the doors leading out onto 42nd Street, and he looked back at her in that same moment. He smiled and offered a little parting wave, but she just looked away and walked out into the rain.

Jay had to skip a proper lunch that day and settle for a few granola bars and some yogurt due to his busy schedule so he couldn’t wait to pick up some chicken tikka masala and naan bread with biryani rice at Bombay Garden as he and Paula boarded the 7:32pm train to Scarsdale, where they immediately spotted a few familiar faces. Paula quickly sprouted a smile and she chatted up a woman named Marla from White Plains and a few others whose names Jay couldn’t recall as he took a seat nearby and put in his Airpods to listen to some music on the ride home. The train soon pulled out of the station and the countless lights of the city went soaring past the windows like a meteor shower on a cloudless summer night.

He had been sleeping poorly of late - Jay couldn’t really recall the last time he had slept well - so he was wearing thin and he closed his eyes when the train reached the East 233rd Street Station. He was listening to Charlie Parker’s “Bird Is Free” at low volume and the music was lulling him to sleep. He dozed off for a short time and when he opened his eyes Paula was gone.

“Hey guys, where did Paula go? I closed my eyes for a few minutes and didn’t see her go.”

Marla and the other women gave him a sympathetic look but they remained silent as they all looked down.

“What the fuck! Where is Paula? I’m getting tired of this.”

They all just looked down at their feet and Jay stormed up the aisle towards the front of the train.

He knew, somehow, that this was maybe his fault. His lack of capacity for connection. His arm's-length relationship with the world. Maybe he was the one who needed to speak with a professional. Whatever. He had to find Paula. Introspection could wait.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Just before midnight Jay turned the clock on the bedroom nightstand back by 30 minutes and set the alarm for the usual time, then he climbed into the bed by himself. He remained awake for several hours but eventually drifted off. When the alarm clock sounded the next morning he quickly hit the snooze button to give Paula an extra 10 minutes of sleep time while he made coffee and fixed up a light breakfast for both of them.

When the alarm sounded again Paula arose from the bed and came into the dining room, brushing back her hair with her fingers.

“Babe, why didn’t you wake me up? We’re running a little late. We have to go or we won’t make the train.”

“Actually the clock in the bedroom is a half hour behind. Sit down. We have about twenty minutes for a quick breakfast together.”

She looked a little confused but she took a seat and poured some half-and-half along with a teaspoon of sugar into her coffee, slowly stirring up a little mocha cyclone inside the cheerful red mug bearing the green outline of a Christmas tree.

“Paula, can we talk? I have been thinking about what you have been saying over these last few months. About not being happy. Have you thought about seeing someone? You know, a professional? Someone who might be able to help?”

She just stared at him. The answer was no. They couldn’t talk.

They just sat there quietly. She ate a bit of fruit salad and some toast with boysenberry jam and then went and took a shower once she finished her coffee.

They both got dressed and left the house and just over an hour later he kissed her goodbye beside the golden clock in the center of Grand Central Terminal and they parted ways until the train ride back home that evening. Jay had meetings scheduled one after another in Midtown, then SoHo and the Upper East Side later that day. He already felt tired. Sleep was becoming increasingly elusive and caffeine now stood at the peak of his dietary pyramid.

That night it was raining again and they were running a little late for the train back home, as usual, so they were moving pretty fast when they met up on Lexington Avenue, but Jay could tell right away that something just wasn’t right. Paula wouldn’t - or perhaps couldn’t - look him in the eyes.

When they rushed down the ramp to Track 41 hand-in-hand, Paula suddenly pulled away from him and stopped. He stopped as well and stared back at her quietly. She was looking him in the eyes now.

“I’m sorry, Jay."" She shook her head. ""If anybody could have saved me, it would have been you.” She loved Virginia Woolf. He stopped breathing.

Without any further explanation Paula simply turned and fell onto the opposite side of the tracks just as the train coming in from Connecticut pulled into the station and she disappeared beneath it. Gasps of horror went up from all around. Jay screamed and tried to follow her down but some other commuters standing nearby saw what had happened and quickly rushed in to restrain him as he wailed up at the dark rafters above, over and over again until he collapsed from sheer exhaustion and despair.

Eventually, the police arrived.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The next night Jay and Paula boarded the train to Scarsdale and saw some familiar faces. He was tired and hungry, but as usual she was quickly engaged with her friends and soon they were all laughing about one thing or another. Jay smiled at her but he really just wanted to get some cheeseburgers and fries from O’Malley’s Grill for both of them and kick off his shoes and hit the couch back at home. Maybe catch the second half of the Knicks game.

He plugged in his Airpods and turned up the music on his iPhone. The lights of the city flashed by outside the train's windows like the sparks arising from a hard punch to the face. He closed his eyes and lost himself in the music for a few minutes\*.\*

Jay fell asleep for a short time when the train arrived at the East 233rd Street Station and when he awoke, Paula was gone.

He asked the others where she went, but no one would speak with him. They all just gave him a look that was some odd mixture of fear, discomfort and pity, and then they hung their heads and stared down at the floor.

He quietly cursed them all under his breath and went off to search for his wife. She was nowhere to be found, but he continued to search. He looked for her every night. She was his one true love. She was his moon and stars. He had to keep searching until he found her.

1mw4hen,https://www.reddit.com/r/BruisedNotBroken/comments/1mw4hen/observer_from_the_future/,Observer from the future,"What would an observer from the future say about our lives today?

He would say: ""Oh my god, these people were so complicated, or deliberately complicated their own lives. They were the last generation to have the chance to meet physically, over a coffee, in a library, or even in a nightclub.

Meanwhile, for us today, the world of yesterday no longer exists. Everything is computerized, everything is virtualized (even our relationships and love affairs are with virtual anime characters).

Did they know they were the last generation of 'physical touch'? If I had lived in their time, I would have cherished the moments spent with my girlfriend or my wife, and my ego would never have been used as a weapon to destroy my other half…""

And he would be absolutely right. People who still love each other should never separate (back in the early part of the last century, breaking up was often unthinkable for various reasons. Often, they worked through their conflicts).

Today, we have become exchangeable and disposable beings. Replaced by someone new, younger, and not necessarily smarter. Love isn’t complicated; we are the ones who complicate our own lives.

1mw4glv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/1mw4glv/i_dont_like_mix_1023_anymore/,I don’t like mix 102.3 anymore.,"Mix 102.3 has become a repetitive slog for anyone stuck listening in the car. Every morning, the same tired sound bites play on loop. You know the ones, some caller gushing about how much they love the show. “Hailey and Max are amazing, they’re so funny,” blares through the speakers. It’s relentless.

Imagine a radio station so desperate for validation they broadcast their own reviews. Of course people say the show is funny, they’re calling in as fans. It’s like a restaurant bragging about its own Yelp reviews on the menu. Nobody’s tuning in for a boring show, so why the constant self-praise? The station picks a mildly amusing moment, not even that funny, turns it into a 10-second clip, then hammers it into your ears for a week straight. It’s lazy programming, pure and simple.

Driving in the morning, you don’t always choose the radio station. It’s just there, filling the silence while you’re stuck in traffic. Mix 102.3 takes advantage of that captive audience, shoving the same recycled content down your throat. I don’t hate Hailey and Max, they’re fine. Max even called me a legend once when I called in, which was nice. And Hailey won me a $50 bakery voucher on one note wonder. 

Still, the repetition grates. 

Then there’s Brit and Laura, whose laughs are like nails on a chalkboard. It’s not their fault, maybe, but it’s hard to stomach when I’m trying to relax in the afternoon.

I used to enjoy Will and Woody. They had a decent vibe. Then I ran into Will while cycling. I was out riding my cousin’s old 1990s Colnago, which had several mechanical issues, and spotted him at a café. I said hi, just being friendly, and he gave me this annoyed look, like I’d interrupted his coffee. Then he rode off, painfully slow, on some flashy $20,000 bike he clearly bought with his radio cash. I caught up to him on Norton Summit, easily. 

When I reached the top, I waited for him, noticed his seat was way too low, like he had no idea how to set up a bike. His tires were practically flat too. I offered to help, suggested he raise his seat, check his tire pressure. He just laughed, said he was good, then he raced towards the road, too busy to look for traffic, nearly got clipped by a car when he pulled onto the road without looking. The guy’s ego was bigger than his cycling skills.

Then there’s Kyle and Jackie O, whose show Mix 102.3 airs. I didn’t get why people disliked them until I heard Kyle laugh at a caller. This woman opened up, vulnerable, saying she had no friends and struggled with her weight. Kyle turned it into a punchline. Jackie O tried to scold him, but it felt half-hearted, and they both just laughed awkwardly. It was cruel, plain and simple. The whole station feels like it’s coasting on cheap laughs and recycled content. Honestly, everyone on Mix 102.3 could use a session with a therapist. Maybe they’d figure out how to make a show worth listening to, instead of leaning on tired sound bites and self-congratulation. Until then, I’ll keep the radio on low, or better yet, switch it off.

**solution point :** Just upload your travel photos → GPS data creates your journey path automatically → Add quick 30-character thoughts → Share as beautiful web pages that friends can actually explore.

Think of it as your travel memories getting the ""connect the dots"" treatment, but way cooler.

**What makes it different:**

* Your route appears instantly as you add photos (no manual plotting!)
* Map-first approach - location is the main navigation, not date folders
* 30-character limit on notes (forces you to capture the essence, not write essays)
* Creates shareable journey pages that work like mini travel guides

App: [Download Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whitecrow.groute)

So I got tired of juggling between Google Photos, Maps, Notes, and trying to remember ""wait, what did I do after that cafe in Paris?"" when telling travel stories. Built this app called **Groute** that automatically connects your photos by location and time to create visual travel routes.  
  
Built this because I'm convinced that **location + time + moment = perfect travel memory**, and most apps only handle one of these well.

Currently in beta and would genuinely love to get some feedback from fellow travelers who actually *get* the pain of organizing travel memories!

**If you're interested in trying it out, comment below or DM me!** Especially looking for feedback from people who travel frequently or have that ""I have 10,000 unorganized travel photos"" problem.

What do you think? Does this solve a real problem or am I just overthinking travel journaling? 🤔

**P.S.** 

\- The app shows Paris in the screenshots but works anywhere your phone can GPS tag photos. Been testing it everywhere from Seoul coffee shops to Patagonian highways!

Currently I'm in my senior year of college and am looking for a job. For whatever reason the process has been realy discouraging, I have been sending out 100s of emails for coffee chats, and often doing them late into the night (I'm in asia right now, but I want a job in the US, so all the coffee chats are in US time). Its not that I have a problem with putting in work, I know that I usually am quite headstrong (i.e when I switched to a math degree and started hard grinding math to catch up in uni) but now with this I am very stumped, I think I see very little purpose in doing it. To me, even if I get a position, I am applying to things I don't even want to do really, and its quite difficult for me to see any real goal/future to look towards. I think I find it quite meaningless.

IK I probably sound a bit like an ass because Ik many people would want to be in my current position, and ik that I am very priviledged to even attend uni in my country. When I talk to my family about it, they don't really seem to receptive and my mom gets quite frustrated herself, and I hate to see her like that, so I just don't mention it to them. Anyways, this general feeling of malaise has clouded most of my life, and things that I used to enjoy doing I no longer enjoy, I don't wanna see people, and I am tired and binge eating alot, causing me to skip actual meals. Ik its unhealthy but its hard for me to control. I sometimes get annoyed when my parents make some jabs at me binge eating, like when I refuse to ear dinner they may joke that I may as well binge eat real food (which ig is valid), but its not like I want to binge eat. I really do appreciate all their help in my life, though I may sound annoyed rn.

One thing that I'm quite sad to see in myself is that I no longer enjoy art as much as I used to, I still really want to be a concept artist or vis dev artist at some studio/creative team, but all this shit has been getting to me + all the current state of the animation industry is kinda messing me up. And when I tallk about this stuff to people they don't seem to give a shit - like these firms are using replacing the artist idk man. Its hard for me to see a viable future in this too. I've felt like this for about 6 months now, and I don't really know what to do. I still try to draw everyday, but ontop of my work, and applying to jobs, networking etc. I basically will stay up most of the night drawing, and end up not getting much sleep.

  
I am not about to start school again, and on top of all the other things I am really not looking forward to it. Next year is gonna be pretty tough math wise, and idk man. ig long story short, I feel confused, stuck, down, dreary, and unmotivated, and feel like everything I do in a day requires much more effort than it should. I hope I'm not ranting too much, but I just need to get my thoughts out somewhere. ",2,1755761794.0,mentalhealth,7,1.0,False

Hello, 

There is a recurring pattern in my life that I can’t seem to shake, and I’m hoping someone here might relate or have insight.

Every time I genuinely appreciate something, it tends to vanish or go wrong shortly afterward. It doesn’t matter how small the thing is. For example:

~ If I admire how well a plant is doing in my garden, it just shrivels and dies.

~ Just recently, I switched to a new brand of coffee and thought, ‘Wow, this is amazing’. Later I made the same coffee the exact same way and it tasted terrible.

~ Products I fall in love with get discontinued.

~ Whenever I look forward to something, something goes wrong or it gets cancelled. 

~ People in my life who I have felt I could truly rely on, have withdrawn for no apparent reason.

~ A few days ago, I sat with my son while he slept and thought loving affirmations over him. Shortly after, he had a major setback in school. 

These are just more surface level examples. There are deeper, more personal instances that follow the same pattern. What’s confusing is I don’t walk around expecting bad things to happen. I don’t believe I’m undeserving of good things. I genuinely try to live with gratitude. Yet, this pattern has persisted for years.  

Has anyone else experienced something similar and been able to shift it? Is there something deeper I might not be seeing? I appreciate any perspectives or experiences you are willing to share. 

Thank you.

Let me tell you a secret. Between me and you.
I love a girl in my office. We recently joined this company last month. I first saw her in the HR area of company and there I just saw another simple beauty. Just like a typical guys I admire her, admired her beauty and then just told my self, she is aukat ke bahr.
And luckily we’re in the same batch. Our group consists of 6-7 members out of which 3 are females. Beside her, other both girl are very nice and sweet, and we usually enjoy time altogether.
Now, let me tell you something. Just like my name I’m always trippy. Always high during work hours. And everyone in my group knows. I even made few other guys go high. Sometimes on their approval. 
First just like everyone, it was the attraction, and soon that attraction led me to fall for her. She is very gorgeous, very very gorgeous. I love everything about her, her tucking of hairs behind the ear, her dressing sense, I love her vibing over song. And she is very extremely extrovert. 
And I told you I’m always high, so I made obvious that I like her and she probably knows that I like her. You know what I love dark circles too. Imagine a girl with clear milky skin, and there’s dark circles complimenting her. She always welcomed me when I want conversation. But the truth is she hates these type of guys that do stuff like smoking, going high. And I’m just average in terms of looks.
And in fact, the day I joined that company I had only 6 outfits that I’m repeating from last 1.5 months coz I’m unable to go back to home. 
And one more thing she is very aukat ke bahr, you know when she’s using her phone, I like her that innocent face while scrolling insta. And btw she is a sort of influencer.
She once said she doesn’t have any boyfriend or in any relationship with anyone for the last 10 years. Even she is just 22.
I tried to go office without any stuff or high, but I get too nervous and simply ignore her. That’s why I only talk to her when I’m high. 
I’m sure she hates me… let’s say she doesn’t hate me but she doesn’t want to be friends with me either. 
And frankly speaking I don’t want to be friend with her coz I’m very insecure about her. Whenever she talk with other guys I feel something in my stomach.
She had also given me a tag “creep”.
Now we rarely talk outside of office stuff. I really miss those days, when she suddenly put hand on table and says let’s play truth and dare or dumb charades or atlas or stone paper scissors or guess the actor or spin the wheel. 
She likes classic cold coffee.
Ohh I forgot, there was an incident when I lost a bet with my friend in stone paper scissors and I had to buy chai for everyone so I ordered 6 chai. But she said I don’t drink chai. Then I go back and ordered a classic cold coffee for her. Btw I was really at that time. 
And from that day, I guess she hates me.

We met for a coffee date and he was so nice and respectful and came across so into me. He flirted a lot over text as well and we had a lot of sexual chats. He then came to mine a few days later and we had sex. He's the first guy I've met in over a year and the him being so nice made me fall for him quite a lot. 

The morning after he left, it was like he did a total 180. I get maybe 5 messages a day and they're so plain. I gave the same amount of effort I was previously towards him for a few days but now I'm just matching his effort which I find really hard to do. Wtf happened? He's coming again this weekend so I know he still wants to have sex (I do too) but he doesn't say it anymore and his entire demeanor has changed towards me. 

I don't know if he's busy or if he's just not into me beyond sex, because despite him saying he values communication, he isn't communicating wtf is going on. He said it feeling weird is ""just bad timing"". If it was to be a purely sexual thing from the start that would've been fine but he was acting so interested in me beyond sex. 

Advice on how to navigate this? The situation has triggered me so badly with feelings of rejection, worthlessness, and reinforcing that I'll never be good enough for someone. Every time he doesn't message me back for hours or sends me one word answers I spiral and break down. The fact he changed so much after sleeping with me is making me think I did something wrong. I know the feelings of rejection are less to do with him and more to do with the abuse I faced as a child but it's so hard to not put these bad feelings in the past.

1mw44ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_UnchainedSkeptic/comments/1mw44ub/welcome_to_my_reddit_profile/,Welcome to my Reddit profile!,"Hello, and thanks for stopping by my Reddit profile! I'm Unchained Skeptic, a streamer and content creator. I primarily make content talking about religion from a formerly religious/ critical point of view. I figured if my discussion of my lack of religious beliefs, critiques of religious nationalism, and counter-apologetics was going to have people calling me a ""Reddit atheist,"" I might as well actually start using the site lol. 

Anyway, this profile is primarily going to be used as my personal blog, where I plan to discuss things such as the evolution of my personal beliefs based on the new information I receive, critique of religious arguments, and things going on in my personal life (whenever something actually worth talking about happens). I also plan to use this as a place to receive feedback on my content and for ideas for content in the future, both related and unrelated to religion. Ultimately, I plan to make a variety of content that all kinds of audiences can enjoy and to veer away from anti-religious discussion dominating my channels, both because I value entertaining people over debate grandstanding, and also because people who are uninterested in getting to the truth, whatever it may be, are exhausting to deal with on a consistent basis. 

I do have a [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/UnchainedSkeptic), where I plan to react to submissions on my streams and in my videos. However, it's currently private, as I'm a small creator and don't want to have a subreddit hanging around without a community interested in adding to it, or to help moderate it. I'll be opening it to the public once my channels take off a bit more, so stay tuned!

1mw42pp,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mw42pp/deciding_between_lelit_bianca_v3_and_profitec/,Deciding between Lelit Bianca V3 and Profitec Move [2000€ budget],"Hi all,

I’m trying to decide between two machines in Europe: the **Lelit Bianca V3** and the **Profitec Move**. They're both similarly priced. I’ve done a lot of research, but I’d love to hear from people who’ve lived with either (or both).

Here’s where I’m at:

* Heat-up time isn’t an issue: I’ll use a smart plug to switch the machine on \~40 minutes before I wake up. Cup warming is featured on both.
* Both are dual boilers with PID, so I’m not worried about steaming power or temperature stability.
* Family use isn’t critical. I’m the only coffee drinker (mostly milk based drinks), but my partner might make me a coffee now and then, and my daughter may use the steam wand for hot chocolate. I can show them how to use whichever machine I end up with.

What’s pulling me in each direction:

# Profitec Move

* I love the push-button simplicity. Timer-based programmable shot stopping means I can grind, tamp, press the button, and steam milk at the same time without worrying about weighing or manually stopping the shot.
* I love the programmability of the pre-infusion.
* It’s compact, modern, and runs cooler than an E61 group, which is nice in summer.
* It seems a little more “appliance-like” in ease of use, which has its appeal.
* Vibration pump may be noisier, but not a deal breaker
* I love the barista lighting

# Lelit Bianca V3

* Plumbing in is a huge plus. Not an immediate need, but I’d love to do this in future. Not worrying about filling a tank or emptying a drip tray would be amazing.
* I love the looks: it feels like a centerpiece in the kitchen.
* Flow control paddle & programmability are very appealing. I like the idea of occasional experimentation, or being able to “rescue” a too-fast shot.
* Rotary pump is quieter.
* My friend with an E61 machine says he now eyeballs espresso instead of weighing every shot, so I’m less worried about being forced into scale dependency.
* Downsides: it does run hotter (basically a little heater in the kitchen), but that’s not a dealbreaker for me.

**My dilemma:**

* The **Move** fits the way I imagine using a machine most days (simple, consistent, less fuss).
* But the **Bianca** offers plumbing, looks, and flexibility that I think I might really appreciate over the long run — and I’d hate to regret not having those features later.

Has anyone else wrestled with this choice? Do you find Bianca can be used in a “press button, get coffee” way once you get familiar, or is it always a bit more hands-on? And for Move owners, do you ever wish you had the flexibility of plumbing or flow control?

Any advice would be hugely appreciated.",2,1755760479.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

So yeah my Parents will throw stuff at me sometimes also hit me with wires, metal hangers, hands and belts.

I remember I had this discord groupchat of friends since I had no friends in real life and I was texting them on the PC behind my parents back and then my mom came and I closed discord and she and my dad went through the google history and found discord, they click it and scroll up to my texts i sent in the group chat and I was telling one of them sarcastically ""suck my dick"" then they went 100% rage mode unplugged the pc yelled at me a lot insults whatever they could say, and my dad was tryna hit me but missed so just used his hand slapped my head against the wall.

My parents especially my dad are short tempered people, I once questioned their religion they went mad insulted me and i went to my room cause I knew they'd hit me.

Like 2 days ago, this was recent. My dad told me go make coffee after you finish lunch and I just ate slower as a joke and didn't notice him getting up to do it. Then my mom gave me a whole lecture how I shouldn't have done that and instead I should go to the kitchen and do it. So i go to the kitchen hes done with the coffee he just looks at me and tells me **"" I am really starting to hate you,""** I didn't take it to heart cuz he says it a lot. Like for example I started an argument with my brother typical sibling fighting at dinner alright my dad says the same thing "" i am really starting to hate you,""

I’ve enjoyed them. I have blackout shades, blackout curtains, and to filter out the remaining light, a blackout canopy around my bed. I get about 7 hours of sleep. My honk-shoos are of pretty good quality, as far as I can tell. I meal prep nutritious food for my lunches, I drink 2 cups of coffee a night MAX, I go to the gym 3x a week, I keep the sleep schedule on my nights off, and my job isn’t very stressful (minus a few micromanagers). In fact, I don’t mind my job!

And yet. AND YET. I’m slowly getting more tired, more moody. All I have the energy to do after getting home the last couple months is doomscroll. My nights off are for meal prepping and trying to muster up the executive function to do some dishes or perhaps a load of laundry that will end up in a pile, in the corner of my room, unfolded. The gym, which held the only forms of exercise I had some fun doing, feels more like a chore to check off now. 

Sometimes with this schedule you do everything, or at least most things right, and it feels like there are no rewards to reap. I liked night shift. I guess it’s starting to take its toll. Switching jobs just feels like such a pain right now, but I’m looking around.

Not that this happening is unusual for any of us, it just sucks ass. Those who can do this for years on end, you’re something special, and I’m jealous!

1mw3qx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mw3qx8/co_workers_have_found_my_secluded_break_spot_and/,Co Workers have found my secluded break spot and now i don't know peace,"I work at a pretty big facility on the night shift. Like most government buildings the night staff is pretty small theres only about 20 of us on my team and we all work in one particular quarter of the facility. 

We have designated break room areas pretty much on each corner of the building on each floor. Naturally when we need a drink or something everyone goes to the same break room closest to where our cubicles are stationed. 

I dont like to be bothered while im making my coffee so I usually go to a break room on the opposite side of the facility.  Ive been doing that for years and I've never encountered a single soul in that break room ever . I always have the place to myself which is what I most desire. 

Flash forward we got a new guy a couple moths ago who has learned that I like to take my break in that break room. He saw me in there one day ( he was probably just exploring the building) and I let slip that i aways go there to relax. 

Well now I dont know what peace is! One day one of my coworkers were looking for me while I was on break so the new guy was like ' I know where to find her !' and lead him straight to me in my private break room while I was in the middle of eating my dinner. 

Now whenever im needed they decide to come to the break room and interrupt my meals as if whatever stupid thing they need to ask can't wait 10 minutes until I get back.  

The things that they interrupt me for are so silly and could be easily relsoved amongst themselves if they tried or aren't pressing and can easily wait until I return but no. They must come searching.

I feel like im babysitting toddlers who can't go 5 minutes without their mommy! Needless to say i will be warming my food and eating in my car moving forward.  😆 ",1,1755759255.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I've been into pourover for...I think 6 months now.

For my birthday, I'm getting some money for a new handgrinded, and i'll top up to max €220 to €300. I'm going to a store to check out some grinders. 

My first grinder is simply a crappy remake from temu, but still manage to make nice coffee (quite inconsistent, and requires quite some dial time). 

What im looking for: I do v60, and recently got a hario switch. I love trying to find all the different flavours that roasters put on the bag (example:cherry, citrus, earl grey). 
I lean towards a more tea like cup, with noticeable flavours, sweet, and a slight acidic. I dont necessarily want a heavy/body like cup, I rather go full espresso for that. 

Any recommendations? I hope my post makes any sense lol. 

Atm my research lead to the Commandante and 1Zpresso ZP6.

I live in the Netherlands, so I'm blessed with some good roasters like DAK, Manhatten, Fried hats. Also have quite some local roasters. Maybe cursed, since it's such an expensive hobby 😅. Bought some coffees from my holiday yesterday (Sumatra, Banda Aceh and Toba region), and have 5 bags of coffee from Malaysian roasters with 2 or 3 being geisha.

## What is Grok AI Trading?

Grok AI Trading is an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze market data and execute trades on your behalf. Think of it like having a super-fast, data-obsessed assistant watching the market 24/7 and pulling the trigger when it sees a good opportunity.

The idea is simple: you deposit funds, set up your preferences, and let the AI do its thing. It’s designed to cater to both beginners and more seasoned traders, thanks to its **user-friendly interface** and **customizable settings**. It supports multiple trading assets including cryptocurrencies, forex, and even commodities.

The platform claims to offer **real-time market scanning**, pattern recognition, and predictive algorithms to give users an edge. While that sounds like a lot of buzzwords, there’s actually some substance under the hood—which we’ll get into shortly.

## Who Created Grok AI Trading?

Here's where things get a little fuzzy.

As of now, **the creators behind Grok AI Trading remain anonymous**, which is pretty normal in the world of auto-trading platforms. That said, the structure, design, and features of Grok AI are **strikingly similar** to platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge. This might suggest that it's part of a larger network of AI trading tools developed by the same team or white-label providers.

While anonymity might raise eyebrows, it’s worth noting that many successful trading bots operate quietly behind the scenes. What matters more is whether the platform works, is secure, and allows users to withdraw their funds without hassle.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Grok AI Trading Today](https://tinyurl.com/22wv9ukb)
## How Does Grok AI Trading Work?

At its core, Grok AI uses a combination of **machine learning algorithms**, **real-time data feeds**, and **automated execution strategies** to identify profitable trades. Here's how the process generally works:

1. **Data Analysis**: The AI scans charts, news, and price movements across various markets.
2. **Trade Signals**: It generates buy/sell signals based on historical data patterns and real-time indicators.
3. **Execution**: Trades are placed automatically through partner brokers once a signal meets the defined criteria.
4. **Risk Management**: Users can set limits like stop loss, daily trade caps, and preferred assets.

You can also toggle between manual and auto modes. That’s particularly helpful if you want to override the bot’s decisions or just test a strategy manually before going full auto.

## Grok AI Trading Pros and Cons

Like any platform, Grok AI Trading has its highs and lows. Here's a quick breakdown:

### Pros:

- **AI-Powered**: Uses real-time analysis for potentially faster and smarter decisions.
- **User-Friendly**: Clean interface that doesn’t overwhelm beginners.
- **Demo Account**: Try before you risk your money.
- **Multi-Asset Trading**: Supports crypto, forex, stocks, and more.
- **Custom Settings**: You can tailor the bot's behavior to match your risk tolerance.

### Cons:

- **Minimum Deposit of $250**: Not super high, but still a barrier for some.
- **Lack of Transparency**: No public info about the creators.
- **No Mobile App**: Mobile access is browser-based only.
- **Success Rate Claims**: 85% sounds great, but should be viewed with skepticism.

### [👉 Open Your Grok AI Trading Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/22wv9ukb)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access Grok AI Trading?

Grok AI Trading is accessible on pretty much any device with a browser.

- **Desktop**: Works well on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
- **Tablet**: Fully functional on iPads and Android tablets.
- **Smartphones**: Mobile-optimized browser version (no dedicated app yet).

So if you're the kind of person who likes monitoring trades while waiting in line for coffee, you're covered.

## Grok AI Trading – Supported Countries

Grok AI supports users from **most countries**, but there are a few important exceptions:

- ✅ UK, Australia, South Africa, India, most of Asia
- ❌ United States, Canada, parts of Europe (due to regulatory restrictions)

If you're in a restricted region, you won’t be able to sign up unless you use a workaround (not recommended).

## Grok AI Trading – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is probably the platform’s biggest selling point. The AI pulls in tons of market data every second and reacts faster than any human could. Whether it’s a sudden bitcoin spike or forex movement, the bot is designed to **pounce on trends instantly**.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you've never traded before, the dashboard is super intuitive. You get simple menus, clear charts, and helpful tooltips. Perfect for beginners who want to avoid a steep learning curve.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no standalone app, the site works really well on mobile browsers. I’ve used it on both iPhone and Android without any lag or layout issues.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set alerts for price triggers, trade performance, and account changes. These can be sent via email or SMS, so you’re always in the loop.

### Multiple Asset Trading

This isn’t just a crypto bot. You can trade **bitcoin, altcoins, forex pairs, stocks, and even commodities**. That kind of diversity is a big plus if you want to spread your risk.

## Is Grok AI Trading a Scam?

Honestly, I don't think so—but I get why people ask this.

Grok AI Trading feels a lot like other legit-but-anonymous platforms like Bitcoin Code. It works, people are withdrawing funds, and the demo account is a nice trust-building feature. That said, the lack of transparency and regulatory info means you **shouldn’t treat it like a bank**. Start small, test the waters, and always use money you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Grok AI Trading?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms like this. It’s not a crazy amount, but still enough that you should do your homework before committing.

### Grok AI Trading Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested it out and got a reply within 10 minutes, which is solid. They also have an FAQ section, though it’s a bit basic.

## How do you start trading on Grok AI Trading?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official site and fill out your name, email, and phone number. It takes less than 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff) and make your first deposit. The minimum is $250, and you can use credit cards, bank transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either use the **demo mode** to practice or jump right into live trading. The AI bot kicks in automatically once you enable it.

## How to Delete a Grok AI Trading Account?

To delete your account:

1. Contact customer support via chat or email.
2. Request account deletion.
3. They’ll confirm your identity and process the request, usually within 48 hours.

Make sure to withdraw all your funds first.

## The Verdict

Grok AI Trading is a **solid option for anyone curious about automated trading**. It’s fast, user-friendly, and packed with features that make it easy to get started. While there are a few red flags (like anonymous developers and bold claims), the platform performs well in real use.

If you’ve got $250 to spare and want to see what AI trading is all about, I’d say it’s worth a shot. Just keep your expectations in check, and don’t go all-in until you’ve seen some results.

I’m looking for constructive feedback on my resume. I have 6+ years of experience in hospitality, primarily managing cafe, team leadership, and business development. I founded and ran a high-traffic coffee shop for 6 years in Ukraine. Also had some remote managing my own marketing agency experience, though it might not be relevant.  
I recently moved to the U.S. and am looking for my first hospitality job here. I understand it might require starting at a lower-level position, but my goal is to secure a management role in cafes or coffee shops. I’m also considering a leasing agent role, though I understand that would require a slightly different resume.

**Details:**

* **Location:** Oregon, USA
* **Target roles:** Cafe/Coffee Shop Manager, Barista/Shift Leader, Assistant Manager, Leasing Agent
* **Challenges:** I want my achievements and leadership experience to stand out more and ensure my resume is ATS-friendly. I’m also concerned that English is not my first language (though I’m proficient, C1–C2 level) and that I’ve never had a job in the U.S., so this will be my first work experience here. Additionally, I'm not sure if I should make separate block to make it clear that, besides being a founder/manager, I have hands-on experience in all standard cafe/bar roles (barista, server, cook, bartender, shift leader) and want feedback on how to present this effectively. Lastly if I should make it 1 page or not.
* **Feedback requested:** Clarity, formatting, impact of bullet points, and overall readability

Thanks so much in advance! Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I just moved back from Europe and have been really curious about speciality coffee consumption habits in India, especially since we're in such different places compared to the West, financially, culturally and socially.

I'd love to hear what each of you is looking for in your ideal coffee. It could be a particular kind of roast, a specific set of flavour notes, attractive packaging or brand design, great value for money or something else entirely.

And more interestingly, are you able to find your ideal coffee currently? If not, what do you think is limiting you in attaining it? Is there a coffee or roaster from elsewhere that you've been meaning to try or think you'd love but is inaccessible because of the tariffs situation regarding coffee imports to India?

I personally enjoy really lightly roasted, washed coffees (filter, specifically) that emphasise sweetness and delicate floral and fruity flavours, though this is a bit of a generalisation and I'm always excited to try something new. These are some of the most memorable coffees I've ever had:

They say the camera never lies. But I know better. It flirts, tempts, and sometimes tells beautiful little half-truths. I’m the man behind the lens, chasing the wild, the intimate, the cinematic,those stolen moments where everything feels raw, honest, and just a little electric.

I shoot stories for a living. Sometimes wrapped in lace, sometimes soaked in candlelight. Boudoir, portraits, the spicier side of storytelling… I capture confidence in its most seductive forms. It’s not about posing…it’s about presence, and the way someone lights up when they feel seen.

Off-camera? I’m your classic Irish mischief maker. Inked, emotionally fluent, always with a playlist for the moment, a half read fantasy book in one hand and a cup of cold coffee in the other. I live for twilight walks with my camera in hand and off the cuff road trips, the kind of nights that start soft and end unforgettable.

I’m drawn to soul deep conversation and cheeky chemistry. Give me someone who knows the difference between touch and connection, who likes to blur the lines between muse and co-conspirator.

Tell me—when was the last time you let someone really see you?

And yes, I absolutely swap pics. It’s kind of my thing.

She’s a workaholic in every sense. She finds all of her fulfillment in life by creating spreadsheet, running meetings, reporting on budgets, etc.

We are empty-nesters now, but I did the majority of the time consuming parts of raising the kids.

Now, we are on vacation in the northwest for a few weeks and she continues to work remotely every day.

I have been going everywhere by myself while she puts out fires through Zoom meetings.

If I voice how I feel or ask if we can spend time together, she has long complex explanations about how impossible it is for her to cancel meetings or change her schedule.

During the day, I daydream about what it will be like when we finally get to be together at night, but she falls right to sleep so she can start the next day with early meetings.

I find myself fantasizing about what it would be like to meet an interesting woman in Seattle or Portland who would love to just sit and talk with me at a coffee shop or book store. 

Honestly, I don’t even want sex, I just want intimacy and for the loneliness to go away for a while.

Of course I’ll behave and we will spend the next two weeks working around her schedule and I will see a lot of cool places by myself during the day and spend a lot of nights tossing and turning while she snores.",2,1755758281.0,sexlessmarriage,3,1.0,False
1mw3her,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1mw3her/how_do_i_navigate_reconnecting_after_15_years/,How do I navigate reconnecting after 15 years? Even when things are a little messy.,"When I was 24 years old I dated a self centered arrogant and driven young man (he was 29). We dated for a year and his obsession with himself, partying, along with the business he was building, made him incredibly hard to be around. I was so in love and doting, and just wanted some of the love returned. I broke up with him and never experienced any regret. He continued to be in my life, expressing remorse. I had started my own business and he was supporting my business, bringing tons of friends and clients. He asked for a second chance a few times but I felt hurt that he didn’t appreciate how in love I was with him at the time.

Time marched on. We both became quite successful. I was married to a man that cheated on me and financially bled me dry. Currently I have been in a new relationship not meeting my needs the last five years. From the outside I saw that he was married for 10 years and doing great. We’d say hi and be friendly on social media every few years. Until….

I got more deeply into therapy the last year. I started to really examine my patterns. How many times I accepted sub par love into my life, how many times I chose abuse and lies just to not be lonely. I started to really regret that I didn’t give this ex a second chance. Our values were so aligned and we wanted the same things in life. But my hurt feelings wouldn’t allow me to see his growth and humility.

I didn’t want to disrespect what seemed like a perfect marriage from the outside….but my therapist helped me write something that would be a neutral amends. That acknowledged how I made a mistake and I appreciate our time as “kids”…..when I made this amends two weeks ago the perfect facade of his life crumbled….

He’s not actually married. He and his fiancé don’t even live in the same home at the moment. His therapist is urging him to leave her. He feels they have nothing in common and don’t want the same future. He’s 43 now though and fears starting over.

I didn’t right away… but today I finally divulged to him what happened in my divorce, and the abuse that continually led me down paths of desperate decision making. When he talks about the things he wants for his future they’re the things I still want for mine. He now knows I’ve been in a failing relationship financially supporting a man in one of the most expensive cities in America. That I’m scared to start over myself.

I can tell we both still love our partners. I can tell we both feel complexed and soooo weirded out about this timing.

I am currently the one reaching out. Which reminds me of what our 20s were like. I was always chasing him. Until I finally pulled away, then he regretted losing me. He’s always been emotionally consumed with himself. So I know it’s normal for him. But I have a hard time seeking a man out.

But i know him, and I can tell the depression is consuming him and he’s terrified of losing his pets and the status quo of his life. And honestly I am in the same place.

But I can’t ignore these feelings that are coming up. I don’t know what to say. How to handle them. I’ve been checking in on him and every time we talk I want to suggest just getting on a plane and grabbing a coffee….seeing if that chemistry is still there. I don’t know.

How do I handle this? Men! Please tell me how to navigate this potential second chance.

If we were in the same state I’d suggest just meeting up for coffee…. we are both living with flexible schedules and financial freedom…. I’m thinking of going a month or so more and seeing where our conversations go. And possibly pushing for a meet up.

Is that a good idea? If you were him, what would you want to hear from me? What do i do to make this man give us just a second look?

*edit* both our partners are aware we are talking. Nothing sneaky going on. We are all 4 struggling. But leading with honesty. If we met up it would strictly be coffee. Nothing romantic or disrespectful. But coffee for us is a plane ride away ",0,1755758266.0,AskMen,6,0.4,False

We definitely bonded over the watch. It wasn't just a purchase in my view; she understood my love of the art of Hermès, which is standout from the other luxury French houses. If you've visited FSH you'll know the store is beautiful in design too. 

So over a coffee (with cheval shaped sugar) we chatted at length about that & my shopping list. The Farandole 160, Constance Elan, T4 bracelet in Bleu saphir (to match my watch band) all unavailable. I had expected that. 

Of course I asked as we spoke about the possibility of a leather appointment, as I'd been unsuccessful. She said she'd go and check...... 

She was gone for a good 5 mins. When she came back she was carrying a huge square box. I knew it wasn't a Birkin because of the size. But was it what was on my list? 

A Picotin 26 in gold........ 

Now I don't wear much brown. In fact my wardrobe is mainly dark neutrals with ecru to highlight. I had mentioned this to her in chatting, so whilst I thanked her at this point I thought I'd have to leave without. 

She smiled, took the box, said ""just wait..."" and went off again for what seemed like ages. Then she came back - with another same sized box. 

Yes! A Picotin 26 in black with PH. 🫶 

Now I've wanted this particular bag for what seems forever. It just appears so infrequently online in the EU, and NEVER in the UK. Not on everyone's wish list (but neither is my shoulder Birkin 29).

I have a couple of twillys to soften at home and she's good to go!

I saw one other customer drop €€€ on fine jewelery and was offered a cargo B25. That's not for me either  - so to get this off my personal list was a brilliant experience.

1mw3fv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1mw3fv1/bringing_california_cool_into_your_home_expert/,Bringing California Cool into Your Home: Expert Interior Design Tips from San Francisco,"San Francisco, known for its iconic fog, rolling hills, and vibrant culture, is also a hub for innovative interior design. The city’s unique blend of urban sophistication and natural beauty has inspired a variety of design trends that bring a sense of calm and creativity into the home. Whether you live in a cozy Victorian, a modern apartment, or a spacious loft, here are some expert interior design tips to bring a little bit of California cool into your living space.

**1. Embrace Natural Light**  
One of the hallmarks of San Francisco homes is their ability to capture natural light. Large windows and open layouts help create a light-filled, airy atmosphere. To mimic this in your own home, consider removing heavy drapes or blinds, opting for sheer curtains that let the sunlight pour in. You can also use mirrors strategically to reflect light and brighten dark corners.

**2. Mix Modern with Vintage**  
San Francisco’s design scene is all about blending the old with the new. Vintage furniture finds and antiques mix effortlessly with sleek, contemporary pieces. Incorporating a mix of both can add personality and depth to your home. Look for unique vintage items, like mid-century modern chairs or old wooden bookshelves, and pair them with minimalist, modern furniture for a balanced look.

**3. Use Earthy, Neutral Tones**  
San Francisco's coastal landscape is reflected in the city's interior design palette, with soft, earthy tones taking center stage. Think light grays, soft whites, muted blues, and earthy browns. These neutral tones create a peaceful environment that brings the outdoors in. Consider adding pops of color through accessories like throw pillows, rugs, or artwork to keep the space feeling fresh.

**4. Incorporate Natural Elements**  
Incorporating natural materials such as wood, stone, and plants is a great way to evoke a sense of calm and connect your home with nature. San Francisco’s love for sustainability means that many homes feature natural wood flooring, stone countertops, or even exposed brick walls. Adding indoor plants, from small succulents to large ferns, can also infuse life and color into any room.

**5. Opt for Open and Flexible Spaces**  
San Francisco homes are often designed with open floor plans that encourage flow and flexibility. These open spaces can be adapted for multiple uses, allowing you to create areas for both work and relaxation. Consider using furniture pieces that can serve dual purposes, like an ottoman that doubles as a coffee table or a sectional sofa that provides both seating and storage.

As a **San Francisco interior designer** would advise, the key to creating a space that feels authentically Californian is to balance functionality with aesthetics. By incorporating natural light, mixing vintage with modern, embracing neutral tones, adding natural elements, and fostering an open, flexible environment, you can transform your home into a relaxing haven that feels both stylish and grounded.",1,1755758109.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

Well let me tell you the actual reality from someone who's been doing this for years from a small town in Uttarakhand.

The loneliness hits way different when you're remote in a small town. I literally wake up, open laptop, close laptop, sleep. That's my social interaction for the day. Meeting new people? Yeah right. Having any sort of social life? What even is that anymore?

Was in San Francisco for two months this year and damn, the difference was insane. People to grab drinks with after work, random coffee runs, spontaneous plans. I went to random places, events, festivals, now I'm back here looking at mountains wondering if the view's really worth being this isolated. Sometimes I think maybe I should just move to Bangalore, get a regular office job. Not that I'm serious about it, but whenever I'm in Bangalore or Delhi there's actual LIFE happening. Friends to meet, things to do, places to go!

The palayan(migration) situation in Uttarakhand makes everything worse. Literally everyone I grew up with has left for the big cities - Delhi, Pune. This town feels like a ghost town. My friends are all out there living their lives and I'm here just... typing code alone.

I've been traveling to keep myself from going completely nuts, but honestly? Still feels like I'm trapped. These past 5 years feel like they didn't even happen. Remote work has me stuck in some weird time warp where I'm getting older but nothing's actually changing. It's all just one long blur of video calls and git commits.

And this is gonna sound ungrateful as hell but the money doesn't even do anything for me anymore. Remember getting that first paycheck in final year? That rush? That excitement? Gone. Now it's just numbers that show up monthly. No one to celebrate with, nowhere worth spending it, nothing to look forward to. Just... numbers on a screen.

The only thing that actually gets me excited these days is taking my family places. Watching them experience new things, seeing them happy that gives me something. But even that feels like I'm living through other people. Like I'm still waiting to break out and actually start living my own life. Thinking about doing a solo trip this year just to see if I can shake this feeling.

I know this sounds like such a first world problem. I have a good job, work from anywhere, saving money while others are struggling. But honestly sometimes I wonder if I'm saving money or just... not living?

Anyone else feel this way about remote work? Or am I just spiralling here?

2. Which town is better for 2 nights Patreksfjörður or Bildudalur?

3. I feel as if I should spend more time in and around Ísafjörður. Is it a difficult drive from Látrabjarg Cliff to Ísafjörður? I'm considering spending the night in Ísafjörður on day 03.

4. Should I skip Akureyri and spend more time around Ísafjörður? I know 2 1/2 days in Westfjords is not enough. I'm considering modifying my itinerary to eliminate the Akureyri segment and spend more time in Westfjords.

5. Driving times, I've added 35% to the times given on Google Map. I've read on some posts I should double the driving times given by Google Map.

Did Holter test because I have arrythmia without any symptoms for many years, it never really bothered me, but I thought why not the time has come to probably check the heart.

Holter test bottom line - no specific findings, no dangerous conditions, everything is great, except for APBs.

Attaching link with hourly results: [https://ibb.co/pvgft950](https://ibb.co/pvgft950)

Context: I drink 4-5 coffees a day for many years, as well as I smoke vape 2% nic nearly 24/7 for many years. 

The fact that peak APBs happen during the night implies something specific?

1mw36up,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mw36up,Lofoten Long Crossing / Norway – most adventurous thru-hike of our life (Review and tips),"**Lofoten Long Crossing – most adventurous thru-hike of our life**

After the Corfu Trail and the GR221, it was about time to level up our long-distance hiking game.  
My wife and I both had company holidays during the first two weeks of August, which seemed to be the perfect period for the Lofoten Long Crossing. 11 Stages, 15-18km every day, 500-+1000m change in elevation per day, extreme landscape.  
To get there, a bit of planning needed to be done – we took the train to the next airport, flew to Oslo, caught another plane to Bodø, stayed there for one night, and took the first ferry to Moskenes on the Lofoten archipelago the next morning.  
At 11:00, the ferry docked and we were ready to hike from south to north.

Our first five days were self-supported, which added 3.5 kg of food to our backpacks. We tried to stay as light as possible and really only took what seemed necessary (I used every single item in my backpack except the gloves – detailed list will follow).  
Backpacks weighed around 13–15 kg at most, but got lighter day by day. Luckily, you don’t need to bring a lot of water since it’s available everywhere.

The first day already made pretty clear that we were not supposed to underestimate what was ahead of us. We hadn’t expected the terrain to be as steep as it was in some sections (even as Austrians, used to big mountains). The trails are not marked and not well maintained (or not maintained at all) – it’s the perfect adventure.

Nevertheless, we quickly adapted to the difficulties of the trail, developed our trail legs and found our pace. There are stunning views literally around every corner. At first you can’t even comprehend what’s going on… spiky steep peaks, crystal-clear lakes, hardly any vegetation or wildlife at all – just plain rock, grass, bushes and moss.

We were lucky with the weather for the first two days, but unfortunately a bad weather period with rain and strong winds was about to start. After the 4th day of hiking we were forced to take two days off and pitched our tent at a campsite (Ramberg) because the rain was crazy and winds reached up to 70 km/h, which made it unsafe to continue.

After the break, we skipped the sections we had lost, because one of them required a lot of road walking anyway, so it wasn’t too bad.  
Back on the trail it still rained for a couple of hours per day, but we got used to it and also had sunny periods. *Embrace the wet* became our mantra.  
The rain also turned the trail into a boggy mess. Sometimes we were ankle-deep in mud for kilometre after kilometre… but still, you get used to it because everything else is so stunning, and by this point we had developed a huge sense of adventure.

We hiked for another three days, camped at the most beautiful locations, but also had to seek shelter from a storm in a small forest – otherwise our tent would have been ripped apart.  
Day 9 on trail brought heavy rain and winds again. At some point the trail turned into a little creek. We looked at each other and we both knew it was over. We hiked 10 km out to the next road and cell phone reception, booked an apartment on the shore, and hitchhiked 25 km into the next town, where we stayed 3 nights until it was time to get home.

 

* Were we disappointed not to finish? – Yes.
* Did we discuss our decision several times? – Yes.
* Was it the most adventurous thing we’ve ever done together? – 100%
* Would I recommend doing it? To each and everyone!

 

There is one thing you can’t control – and that’s the weather. Weather is king!

We are not regretting a single minute on the trail and it did something to us, I can´t fully name yet but it´s good!

 

 

**Tips for the Long Crossing:**

* Due to rainy, boggy and wet conditions I would **NOT** recommend trail runners. Boots were the better choice.
* Bring a water filter – even tho the water is clear, there is sheep poo everywhere.
* Real Turmat freeze-dried meals are really good, we tried them all. Try Rendeer Stew
* Use a pack liner – rain covers will NOT keep the inside of your backpack dry after several hours or days of rain.
* Keep your camp clothes as dry as possible and bring warm enough layers. Putting on the puffy at the end of the day felt amazing every single time.
* Talk to other hikers about the trail – we got plenty of useful information.
* Eat stockfish.
* Bring all your tent stakes and pitch your tent well – high winds can occur anytime.
* Eat a lot and bring sweets for mental support.
* Your rain jacket will not stay dry – embrace it.
* Norwegian people are really, really friendly. Ask and they will help you (for example, we were allowed to dry our tent in the basement of a campsite).
* Most ferries are free if you’re a pedestrian… and I love boat rides.
* Besides the popular trails there are not many people. Solitude is beautiful.
* Hiking poles were essential for us, especially on boggy terrain and descents.
* Plan more days than there are stages… rest days or forced breaks need to be taken into account.
* Hitchhike roadsections – we hitchhiked 4 times and every single time someone picked us up in less than 5 minutes.
* Avoid walking on the E10 or on bridges – it’s busy and not pleasant without a pedestrian walk.
* Stop and turn around every once in a while – the views change so quickly.
* Don’t get intimidated by other hikers who may be faster or handle difficult terrain better. It’s your hike, it’s your pace.
* There is a ferry from Svolvær to Skutvik and a fast boat to Bodø if you need to return from the northern part to the airport in Bodo.
* Make sure to visit the little café in Vindstad run by volunteers… real trail angels.
* Be kind to each other / your hiking partner – we both had a bad days eventually! Support is everything!
* Wind is your friend when it comes to drying your shoes and tent
* Clif Bars are the best
* Be careful when cooking after a long demanding day on the trail. Your concentration is low, I spilled my boiling water and in a desperate attempt to catch it, I burned a hole in my puffy
* Bring patches to fix your cloths
* Don’t trust the internet, not even me because for you the hike could be different as well.
* No bugs – zero mosquitos. Even tho one hiker told us about one stage where it was terrible.
* Put all your camp cloths and sleeping stuff (earplugs etc.) in the foot box of your sleeping bag, so you don´t have to gather everything together
* Use drybags
* No need for a headlamp in summer. It will not get completely dark
* Bring rain pants not just a rain jacket
* Norway is expensive
* Eat cloudberries – never tested anything close to it and they all along the trail, as well as blueberries.
* Aeropress makes good coffee and is not too heavy for the trail
* Keep your eyes open for sea eagles, they are beautiful
* A straight section of 2km on the map with no change in altitude can take you 2.5h (Forsfjord – Vindstad)
* Merino does the trick
* The MT100 Puffy Jacket from Decathlon is the best bang for your buck
* Prepare your own breakfast to safe money, get enough calories and something tasty in the morning (oatmeal, milkpowder, dried fruit, nuts, chocolate…)
* Switch your phone to flightmode – safes you battery and does not distract you from the beauty and the people around you
* Resupply is easily possible in Ramberg, Leknes and Svolvaer
* Get the reis app for public transport
* Get multiple weather forecast apps just to realize none of the is correct
* Make a lighterpack list even if you are not ultralight in any way, it just helps to get an overview and will help you to sort out. Lighter packs make a safer hike.
* We carried an Garmin Inreach Mini 2…the SOS button provides kind of a safer feeling
* Get a cheap and light foam mat. They are great for breaks, to put under your inflatable mat to give it some protection from the ground or just to lay out stuff on it and have a dry place. There is one from Decathlon that is 5€ and 150g.
* Make friends
* Have fun
